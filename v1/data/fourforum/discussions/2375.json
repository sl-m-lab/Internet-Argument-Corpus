We would also expect to see high mountains and that the Earth is mainly covered by water (70%). Uluru and many Australian features also provides very strong evidence that many of Australia's landforms formed quickly a short time ago.

   "Hello, Rogue. I hope you are well.\n \n \nIf there was a flood, we would expect to see millions of creatures to be burried in sedimentary rock all around the world, would we not?\n\n Yes, I suppose we would, but then, with the speed and violence at which the flood occurred we would also expect to see quite a mixture of species in each of the various strata. But we actually see more primitive species in lower strata and more modern species in upper strata; we see transitional forms linking major taxonomic groups, and the species showing more primitive characteristics are always lower in the geologic record that those showing the more advanced traits. We never see any kind of bird in Devonian strata, we never see any human in Jurassic strata, and so on. Hydrological sorting does not explain how the great variety of species that existed at each time is only found in the correct strata, not higher, not lower. Differences in intelligence does not explain how even plants are segregated. And no method that the flood geologists have come up with has ever been able to explain the perfect sorting of the various species.\n \n Finally, it is possible to elucidate the manner in which most strata were produced; this isn't black magic. There are too many strata that could only have been produced by slow processes over very long periods of time.\n \n \n \nUluru and many Australian features also provides very strong evidence that many of Australia's landforms formed quickly a short time ago.\n\n Here is an article talking about the creation \"scientist\" Snelling.

   "To Ursus maritimus:\n Hello, Rogue. I hope you are well. \n Hello, and yes I am going quite well - a little busy, but well -- thanks for asking. How are you?\n \n You post had pretty much all of the points that I would expect an evolutionist to bring up. Just to be different for once, I'll deal with your last point first (your statements are in bold):\n \n Answers in Genesis if full of misrepresentations of real science, logical blunders, and out right lies. \n \n Now I would like to ask, where is your evidence for making such an accusation? Could you please point out one article in which Answers in Genesis has made \"misrepesentations of real science, logical blunders, and out right lies\"? I would be extremely grateful. What you firstly need to know before you rush into analysing the small picture (evidence) is the big picture:\n \"As Christians, we (and AiG) are bound by God's Word which says not to lie. As atheists though, lying and telling the truth are neither right nor wrong. This is evident throughout history. \n \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/1201.asp \n \n See, evolutionists believe in the \"survival of the fittest\" mentality instead of \"love thy enemy\". So they are not afraid to lie to make themselves appear better. We get this often when they send us false claims and we search the claim back to the source document and source research and usually find a different story. So it is wise to be careful of what they say and always check it back to the source. Then evaluate their interpretation. \n \n Obviously, they believe their interpretations as fact and anything that doesn't fit with their interpretation is a lie in their eyes.\" ~ Email from Answers Department.\n \n Doesn't the last paragraph sound somewhat familar? You believe that evolution is the truth, and just because these scientists have a different interpretation to you they are wrong.\n \n Yes, I do find it weird that people, who really should know better, can hold certain beliefs so strongly that they completely blind themselves to obvious facts and data and the logical inferences from them. \n \n You know what, this is somewhat funny. Your argument actually goes against you. Let me give you an example. The one that I want to use as an example is the Talk Origins article on 3rd Stage SNRs (Super Nova Remenants). Here they claim that there are many 3rd Stage SRNs, which is contrary of the evidence. There is another site Too Few Supernovas for a Young Universe? that displays a similar argument by stating that the mystery of the lack of 3rd Stage SNRs is \"also solved\". But what they fail to tell us the rest of that quote: \n \"It appears with the above explanation there is no need to postulate values of Eo/n differing greatly from those in the galaxy, and the mystery of the missing remnants is also solved\". \n Well, to what explanation are they referring to? The explanation is that IF:\n 1. There was an incorrect estimate so anomalies should be included. \n 2. Assume the detection limit is expanded by a factor of 3.\n 3. Claims that there was an erroneous number detected by a factor or two.\n \n So basically what Clark and Caswell did was make up the above assumptions to try and fit the evidence to the evolutionary model. Basically they said that since the data didn't match teh evolutionary premises, they would assume that it was an incorrect estimate, the detection rate and wrgon and anomalies should be included, then they conclude that this fits with evolution. This doesn't solve the problem (and is an embarrassing interpretation) but shows their allegiance to evolution over the observed facts, which was what Dr Sarfati commented on. Now this is bad science. Need I bring up England's peppered moths (a recently exposed fraud that is still be used as evidence for evolution in school biology textbooks), the embryonic recapitulation fraud (once again, still is being used as evidence for evolution in biology textbooks), countless fraud apemen (I don't mean the ones where they have just been really badly misinterpreted, but the actual frauds), and so on? All of these frauds and really bad misinterpretations (including Nebraska man - a whole evolutionary story was made up from one tooth [a pigs tooth], which shows that the evolutionists have quite a vivid imagination) wrongly mislead people and have really been sad in the history of \"science\". It is just like a lesson in story telling rather than science.\n \n I do find it weird that people who call themselves Christians and claim a higher morality will blatantly lie to their followers. Answers in Genesis, I am afraid, has evidence of nothing but their own moral bankruptcy. \n \n Why should I believe evolutionists who affirm that telling lies is neither right nor wrong over people who are bound to telling the truth? Once again, some evidence would be appriciated to back up your claims - thanks. \n \n Did you know that the \"battle\" between evolutionary and creationary scientists doesn't occur over science? That is right! Ken Ham and the other creation scientists believe in the same science as Dr Dawkin his fellow evolutionary scientists. I believe in the same science as you do, i.e. you believe in the science of genetics? So do I. Do you believe in the science of natural selection, chemistry, biology, physics, and so on? So do I. We totally agree on the facts and evidences in science. We have the same sciences, as do we have the same scientific facts and evidences (i.e. same stars, etc. and same red shift, same CMB and so on). So where are we different? In the way that we interpret those facts and the way in which we interpret science. You start from an atheistic point of view, while I start from a Biblical point of view. In fact, H.S. Lipson (Professor of Physics, University of Manchester, UK) in his article titled \"A physicist looks at evolution\" - Physics Bulletin, vol. 31, 1980, p. 138 - says:\n \"In fact, evolution became in a sense a scientific religion; almost all scientists have accepted it and many are prepared to \"bend\" their observations to fit in with it.\" [This is exactly what Talk Origins exceed at doing.]\n \n L.Harrison Matthews in 1971 in his article titled \"Introduction to Darwin's The Origin of Species\" (J.M. Dent & Sons Ltd, London, p.xi) stated:\n \"The fact of evolution is the backbone of biology, and biology is thus in the peculiar position of being a science founded on an unproved theory - is it then a science or a faith. Belief in the theory of evolution is thus exactly parallel to belief in special creation - both are concepts which believers know to be true but neither, up to the present, has been capable of proof.\" The situation has not changed much in 33 years.\n \n Or how about this one, Professor Whitten (Professor of Genetics, University of Melbourne, Australia) in 1980 Assembly Week address stated:\n \"Biologists are simply naive when they talk about experiments designed to test teh theory of evolution. It is not testable. They may happen to stumble across facts which would seem to conflict with its predictions. These facts will invariably be ignored and their discoveries will undoubtedly be deprived of continuing research grants.\" Is this good science?\n \n It is as Obi-Wan Kenobi says in Return of a Jedi (Episode VI of Star Wars), \"What I told you was true from a certain point of view\"... \"Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our point of view.\" This can be applied to our little discussion here, you already have refused the existence of a Creator and therefore must describe how life could have come around by purely naturalistic processes - not matter what. So to an evolutionists, evolution is true and creation is a lie or falsehood. But the opposite is used for creationists, creation is true and evolution is a lie or falsehood. Do you understand this point. We are arguing over the interpretation of science and observations (or a story of how we came here), not over science and observations themselves. We are in total agreence over science and observations. \n \n Unfortuantely, science and observations - facts - do not mean much by themselves. They must be interpreted (or processed) by people for them to reach a conclusion from the evidence. But the conclusion that we will get (from the same evidence) depends greatly on our own \"point of view\". This is where we differ. I hope that you can understand this. This also applies to your last point in the last paragraph that I have not copied. In evidence of this, Stephen Jay Gould (Professor of Geology and Paleontology, Harvard University) in an article titled \"The validation of continental drift\" in his book Ever Since Darwin in 1978 said that \"Facts do not \"speak for themselves\"; they are read in the light of theory.\"\n \n  But we actually see more primitive species in lower strata and more modern species in upper strata; we see transitional forms linking major taxonomic groups, and the species showing more primitive characteristics are always lower in the geologic record that those showing the more advanced traits. \n \n I think that you have been living in a \"fossil record dream world\" [not meant to be insulting, so please don't take it that way]. This is not the view that the professional evolutionists take. Let me extrapolate on this. In the 1960's the point about the fossil record being stunning evidence of evolution was being made. Take Dr Carl O. Dunbar (Professor Emeritus of Paleontology and Stratigraphy, Yale University, and formerly assistant editor of the American Journal of Science) stated the following:\n \"Although the comparative study of living animals and plants may give very convincing circumstantial evidence, fossils provide the only historical, documentary evidence that life has evolved from simpler to more and mroe complex forms.\"\n \n But nearly 20 years later Mar Ridley (zoologist, Oxford University) in his article titled \"Who doubts evolution?\" that was published in the New Scientists, vol. 90, 25 June 1981, p. 831, in which he states:\n \"In any case, no real evolutionist, whether gradualist or punctuationist, uses the fossil record as evidence in favour of the theory of evolution as opposed to special creation.\" \n Wow! What a change in ideas! Note, this was after concerted creationist exposure of the true nature of the fossil record.\n \n Steven Jay Gould (Professor of Geology and Paleontology, Harvard University) in his article titled \"Evolution's erratic pace\" from Natural History, vol. LXXXVI(5), May 1977, p. 14 stated the following:\n \"The evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches; the rest is inference, however reasonable, not the evidence of the fossils\". \n \n The so-called evolution of man is filled with defunct and fraud history and a sad part of science. For instance, the famous \"Lucy\" type fossil, or australopithecus, has now been determined just to be a unique ape like creature. Detailed studies of the inner ear, skulls, and bones indicate that \"Lucy\" and her like are not part-human transitions. For example, they may have walked differently to most apes, but not in the human manner. The next supposed ape man is Homo habilis of which there is a growing consensus among most palaeoanthropologists that this is a \"junk\" category, i.e. includes bits and pieces of various other types, including australopithecus and Homo erectus. It is therefore an invalid taxon. In otherwords, such as creature never ever existed. Homo erectus is now thought - even by many evolutionists themselves - to be a true human. Some evolutionists now agree that erectus is fully human and should be included in Homo sapiens. \n \n There is more poimnts, as I have only \"semi-covered\" a small fraction of the fossil record and why it does not point to evolution. If you want to, you can create a new thread to discuss the issue of the fossil record and what conclusions we can draw from it. I am also very sorry about the length of this post. \n \n I checked out that site that attacks ]Dr Andrew Snelling's conclusions. But the thing that struck me is that he never dealt with the evidence and arguments produced by Dr Snelling. He did not adequately deal with Dr Snelling's arguments. In response to the weathering argument of feldspars, the author states the following:\n \"...earlier deposits may be quickly covered, sealed off and protected from any further weathering during the processes of deep burial and consolidation to form rock.\" \n Notice, he says that the earlier deposits may be sealed off and protected, but what about the outer layers? They will be exposed to weathering and the feldspars may turn to clay. But we don't see this yet. Over millions of years of weathering, the feldspars of the outer layers (possibly the inner layers) would have all turned into clay. The authors argument does not dismiss or discredit Dr Snelling's argument and conclusion.\n \n All of them. At least the vast majority. Did you realize that the global flood was dismissed over 200 years ago by creationist geologists when they realized they couldn't find any evidence for it? \n \n Times change. Now there is ample evidence to suggest that there was a Global Flood in the days of Noah. You must also remember that advances in science have aided in providing and have increased knowledge of geology since the 1800's. Besides, most Christians back in Darwin's day didn't really have much of an answer to Darwin's theory, now we do.",

   "Hello, Rogue. I know how you feel about being busy. I have been feeling quite everwhelmed since last December.\n \n \n \nCould you please point out one article in which Answers in Genesis has made \"misrepesentations of real science, logical blunders, and out right lies\"?\n\n I do this quite regularly on the NoAnswersInGenesis message board. When I have time, and when the daily AiG article is interesting, I will post a link to it and then point to specific passages that are inaccurate or misleading. I usually do this several times a week.\n \n By the way, I was not implying anything about your honesty or intelligence. Just the people you are using as a source of information.\n \n \n \n \n\"As Christians, we (and AiG) are bound by God's Word which says not to lie.\n\n Are you serious? They are not liars because they claim not to be liars? First, what if their vision of a \"Christian\" is different than yours?\n \n What if they are willing to tell a lie if it's for a good cause? Aren't there situations where you would tell a lie? To protect a Jew from Nazis, for example? Maybe they don't feel it's bad to tell a lie if by doing so they can lead a soul to Jesus? Isn't it conceivable that they might feel this way?\n \n And, although I do suspect that some individuals are knowingly telling an untruth at times, what I really suspect is that they are so biased and blinded by their beliefs that they refuse to really consider and think about the evidence that is presented to them. This kind of willfull ignorance is not very far from lying, in my opinion.\n \n \n \n \nAs atheists though, lying and telling the truth are neither right nor wrong.\n\n This is false. I am an atheist. I feel that lying is wrong, and telling the truth is right. Except in rare instances, like I just mentioned, like where an innocent life may be saved. But in the case of evolution vs. creation - how do your beliefs affect me? What do I care what you believe? At least why should I care enough that I would lie to change your mind? I guess I don't care if you think I am lying, but if I'm lying then what do you get out of conversing with me?\n \n \n \n \nThis is evident throughout history.\n\n This is false. History shows lots of Christians who tell the truth, and lots of Christians who lie. History shows lots of atheists who tell the truth and lots of atheists who lie.\n \n \n \n \nSee, evolutionists believe in the \"survival of the fittest\" mentality instead of \"love thy enemy\".\n\n This is false. I am an evolutionist, but I do not believe in a \"survival of the fittest\" mentality, and, while \"love\" may be a bit strong, I do believe in respect for all humans, even my enemies, as human beings - which I believe constrains how I can behave in regards to them, even if they are my enemies.\n \n \n \n \nSo it is wise to be careful of what they say and always check it back to the source. Then evaluate their interpretation.\n\n Good advice for any source.\n \n \n \n \nObviously, they believe their interpretations as fact and anything that doesn't fit with their interpretation is a lie in their eyes.\" ~ Email from Answers Department.\n\n This is false. Interpretation is not the same as fact, and no one claims otherwise. What is claimed is that AiG either dismisses bona fide scientific observations, makes up nonexistent \"facts\", or uses a very convoluted logic to try to fit facts to their preconceived beliefs. Or they misrepresent what scientists actually claim and what they actually are saying.\n \n \n \n \nYou believe that evolution is the truth, and just because these scientists have a different interpretation to you they are wrong.\n\n No, I believe that evolution has withstood a multitude of tests over the last century and a half, so I believe it is reasonable to be suspicious when someone claims some evidence against it. And when I check out their claims, which you advise to do in the case of evolutionist arguments, I find that my suspicions are justified.\n \n The rest of you post is a discussion of scientific evidence. A good discussion to have, but it isn't possible to adequately discuss all of them in a single conversation. It would be better to discuss them in individual threads, a couple at a time. I just had to comment on the trust you are placing on certain people simply because they claim to be Christians, and the accusations of lying that you are making toward others who merely disagree with you. I am not accusing Christians in general of being liars, nor am I accusing YEC's in general of being liars. I am accusing a particlular source of information, namely AiG, of disseminating falsehoods, either knowingly or through willful ignorance, and I feel that I can, and I feel that I have, backed this up.\n \n You are not required to follow my advice, but I suggest you do the same. You are going to lose the attention of the people to whom you wish to speak if you make a blanket statement like \"atheists are liars\" without any real reasons. If there are specific people you think are dishonest, then say so, but be prepared to provide evidence for this. And don't assume someone is dishonest or biased simply because they disagree with you.",

I have been feeling quite everwhelmed since last December. \n \n Poor guy. Is it starting to come to that point where you have forgotten the meaning of \"holidays\"? I like wise will be very busy studying until the end of October/November this year. \n \n I do this quite regularly on the NoAnswersInGenesis message board...I usually do this several times a week.\n  \n Could you please provide a link to this message board? Thanking you in advance. Also, have you ever thought that if you didn't try so hard to refute AiG's comments that you would have a few more hours to have some R&R? In order to have more time I will be significantly limiting my time on this forum. I will respond to about 1 or 2 a week. As the year progresses I won't be on at all as I will be in 100% study mode.\n \n Are you serious? They are not liars because they claim not to be liars? First, what if their vision of a \"Christian\" is different than yours? \n \n Pretty much. It is not that they claim not to be liars that I believe them. It is because they abide by God's Word - the Bible - as much as they can. A different version of a Christian to me? Well, let me say that the scientists and staff at AiG are more Bible believing than most others around the world. They take Genesis literally, the whole Bible as it was meant to be taken. All what a Christian is is a follower of Jesus Christ who want to \"win the world for Christ\" so to speak, i.e. spread the Good News of Jesus Christ to all peoples - many Christians are persecuted for doing this. Let me say that I believe everything in the Bible, there is not one thing that I doubt, although I may not be able to give all of the answers, such as Joshua's long day. I have no idea how God did it. An atheist would have to reject this idea out of blind faith, while I accept this idea out of faith. Not much of a difference - both require faith.\n \n So in summary, AiG and myself believe the Bible is correct from Genesis 1:1 through to the end of Revelation. Hence, our beliefs are consistant. As a result of their belief in the Bible, they are required not to lie, or they are commanded not to lie.\n \n What if they are willing to tell a lie if it's for a good cause? Aren't there situations where you would tell a lie? To protect a Jew from Nazis, for example? Maybe they don't feel it's bad to tell a lie if by doing so they can lead a soul to Jesus? Isn't it conceivable that they might feel this way? \n \n Good point. As humans who are descended from Adam and as such we have his tendency to rebell against God (as Adam did in Eden nearly 6000 years ago) and hence, we are not perfect -- this is why Jesus came down to Earth to die on the cross to pay the price for our sins and our disobiedence. I do not claim to be a perfect or even a half good Christian, but I do try my best. There are situations where I may lie, such as your example of protecting a Jew from a Nazi (if there are any left). But I would not lie to lead a person to Jesus Christ. If I couldn't do it by simply telling the truth, I wouldn't bother doing it -- even though it is an extremely important thing to do. God gave us free will to either follow His rules, or to rebell against Him and we should respect that free will and hence not lie to decieve anyone. AiG has got the answers to the evolution V creation questions (just different interpretations to evolutionists of the SAME evidence) and hence it is up to a person to choose what he wants to believe.\n \n And, although I do suspect that some individuals are knowingly telling an untruth at times, what I really suspect is that they are so biased and blinded by their beliefs that they refuse to really consider and think about the evidence that is presented to them. This kind of willfull ignorance is not very far from lying, in my opinion. \n \n On this I agree. Being \"willingly ignorant\" is very close to lying. In fact, this argument actually works against your, remember that evolutionary 3rd Stage SNR article that I talked about in one of my earlier posts? This is ignoring the facts and decieving people into believing the evolutionary explanation. Ignoring the facts and making up new ones is being \"willingly ignorant\". In fact, many evolutionists are being \"willingly ignorant\" when it comes to the issue of design. Everywhere I look I am amazed by the amount of design in the world, and to me, I feel that many evolutionists are being \"willingly ignorant\" when they look at that same design and say it is just the result of undirected naturalstic processes. Amazing! Also, Sir Fred Hoyle said in 1981 that, \"The chance that higher life forms might have emerged in this way is comparable with the chance that \"a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein\".\" We know that the chances of this happening is zero, there is not a chance. We are doing probability in extention mathematics, and I know that there is not a chance of this happening. Many evolutionists are being \"willingly ignorant\" of the fact that the chance of evolution happening is zero. There is not a possibility, i.e. P(evolution) = 0. \n \n Also, Dr Richard L. Mauger (geology) in 1977 said in relation to dates getting published in reputable scientific journals, \"In general, dates in the \"correct ball park\" are assumed to be correct and are published, but those in disagreement with other data are seldom published nor are discrepancies fully explained.\" Now this is being \"willingly ignorant\", would you not say?\n \n As I explained earlier in a previous post, the difference in views between me and you is not about the evidence, but the mind-set of the person looking at the evidence. For example, one geologist testified how he never saw any evidence for the Flood -- until, as a Christian, he was convinced from the Bible that the Flood must have been a global cataclysm. Now he sees the evidence everywhere. The Bible talks about people being corrumpted in their thinking after turning their backs on God (Romans 1:18ff) and of people being so spirtually blind that they cannot see the obvious (Acts 28:25-27).\n \n When we use the frame work provided by the Bible we find that the physical evidence from the rocks and fossils beautifully fits what the Bible says [about Noah's Flood]. I will discuss this in a new thread in the coming days. Furthermore, the realization of the reality of God's judgment by the Flood in the past should warn us of the reality of the judgment to come - a judgment by fire - and stimulate us to be ready for that judgment (2 Peter 3:3-13). Those who are not \"in Christ\" will suffer the wrath of God (John 3:36). \n [Some of the above came from The Updated and Expanded Answers Book, p.146.]\n I often wonder if the Bible never mentioned anything about a Global Flood that evolutionists would have no trouble in using it as an explanation of explaining land formations, fossils, and so on. It is quite funny, the are okay with the idea of a Global Flood on Mars that formed all of the landforms (although it has no liquid water now), but they reject the very same notion here on Earth (which has the same, and more factors that point to a Global Flood) even when the Earth is 70% covered by water. Now THIS is being \"willingly ignorant\". \n \n This is false. I am an atheist. I feel that lying is wrong, and telling the truth is right. Except in rare instances, like I just mentioned, like where an innocent life may be saved. But in the case of evolution vs. creation - how do your beliefs affect me? What do I care what you believe? At least why should I care enough that I would lie to change your mind? I guess I don't care if you think I am lying. \n \n Just so you know and for future reference, I don't think that you are lying, I just don't agree with your interpretation of the evidence, that's all. You do bring up many good points. But if you do the kind of things that Talk Origins does, using the 3rd Stage SNR article they wrote as an example, I would think that you are lying. What Talk Origins does is use the Clark and Caswell \"explanation\" and by using that they are ignoring the facts and then they make it up that there have been plently of \"observed\" stage 3 SNRs. Not only is this being \"willingly ignorant\", they are also being liars.\n \n I know that you have morals and so forth, but my question to you is where did you get them from? But before I present my case, I would like you to know that I am not attacking your morals/values/ethics and in no way am I intending to be insulting. In a universe that can be described in terms of naturalistic processes, the word \"good\" becomes as meaningless as \"evil\". If you are an atheist, how do you explain goodness, love, kindness, generosity or sympathy? You are all obviously capable of these, but what do these things mean and why is there any virtue in them? Dr Dawkins says that , \"Universal love and welfare of the species as a whole simply do not make any evolutionary sense\". In otherwords, he is confirming that there is no way to arrive at personal morality from an impersonal universe. If we are the result of unguided processes of evolution, how can we condemn anything as being \"evil\" or commend anything as being \"good\"? Why should we be concerned over issues of justice or fairness, or feel any obligation to treat others with dignity or respect? Some people respond to tragedy by asking, \"How can there be a just God?\", but there question is logically flawed. How do these people get the idea of things being just or unjust? Without a God of absolute justice, words like \"just\" and \"unjust\" have no moral content but are matters of personal opinioon at best and meaningless at worst. Far from moral problems ruling out the existence of God, our sense of things being right or wrong, fair or unfair, just or unjust, and so on, provides a strong clue that there is some transcendent standard that affects us all. \n [Most of the above information came from \"Where was God on September 11?\" by John Blanchard.] \n \n There may well be many Christians who lie, but they are being inconsistant with their beliefs and morals/values/ethics and standards. They therefore aren't representing and completely following what they believe and therefore need forgiveness. Many of your other objections in relation to atheists and morals can be answered from the above paragraph. Especially when you say that you believe in respect for all humans, even your enemies. The way that you treat them (and 90% of all humanity -- exception made for the wacko's, severe examples of what Adam's rebellion and their own rebellion against God can do -- treats eachother) is strong evidence to suggest that there is a some transcendent standard that affects us all that comes from an all loving and all just God.\n \n This is false. Interpretation is not the same as fact, and no one claims otherwise. What is claimed is that AiG either dismisses bona fide scientific observations, makes up nonexistent \"facts\", or uses a very convoluted logic to try to fit facts to their preconceived beliefs. Or they misrepresent what scientists actually claim and what they actually are saying. \n \n I will wait for you to provide that link (as requested at start of message) before I go out and say that you are indeed mistaken here. But your arguments fit nicely with my opinion of Talk Origins. They make up observations (e.g. that there are 3rd Stage SNRs); science journals ignoring dates that are \"out of the ball park\" without providing any explanation as to why they are incorrect; ignoring and making up the facts regarding human evolution, the fossils, the dating methods; and so on. In secular schools, media campagins, and so on, the creationists who sometimes are asked to appear are not well represented and/or they are purposefully misinterpreted/misrepresented. Your accusations are much better when put with Talk Origins and the secular media. I am not aware of one time that they have invented nonexistent facts, nor am I aware of any attempted frauds, such as the evolutionary idea of similar embryos. If it weren't for the creationists pushing this point, many more people would be fooled by this fraud which was popularised by Ernst Haeckel.\n \n Why do they do this? Such deceptions are not because people promote something they know is false - the perpetrators of such frauds believe evolution. But it is this belief system, which seeks to explain how everything originated (i.e. by itself), that easily becomes the foundation for a world and life view (i.e. a \"religion\"). And this can cause such fanatical adherence that its disciples are motivated to go to great lengths to find easy ways to \"explain\" this \"great truth\" to people. The Bible indicates that many consciuosly reject the evdience that God created us (Romans 1:18-23) - even where it means stretching the truth or worse. After all, should Christians lie, they would be inconsistent with the absolute moral standards that their belief proclaims. But the belief that everything just made itself - particles to people - leads naturally and consistently to the belief that there are no absolute standards of right and wrong. We see this becoming more and more evident in today's world.\n [Above came from \"Two recently exposed Frauds used to support Evolution\" - a pamphlet produced by AiG.]\n \n No, I believe that evolution has withstood a multitude of tests over the last century and a half, so I believe it is reasonable to be suspicious when someone claims some evidence against it. \n \n As you should be suspicious, I am when people say that there is observed evidence that goes against the infallible Word of God. You are going back to evolution's beginning in your statement above, i.e. 150 years. But, did you know that almost all of the evidence used at the Scope's Trial to support evolution has been discredited by evolutionists themselves? They no longer believe it. It is not evidence of evolution. And with the explosion in biology especially and genetics, creationists have found more solid evidence against evolution. For example, the theory of evolution says that all life present today has evolved or came from some less complex organisms which eventually came from a microorganism. That is, as time increases, the complexity of life is supposed to increase. The evolutionists will tell you that it is mutations and natural selection that are the processes that increase genetic information in the genome (where genetic information is obviously the DNA - Definitely No Accident ;-). But is this really true?\n \n Firstly we will examine natural selection. Consider a group of winged beatles on a windy island. Let us say that there is a mother and a father beatle that just happen to produce off springs that have no wings at all. This beatles without wings reproduce (as do the winged beatles). Over time, the population of beatles will \"evolve\" a population in which the beatles have no wings (as the winged beatles wiill fly and be blown into the ocean where they will drown). The adaption would be natural selection by mutation. But is this evolution? No, it is just natural selection and mutations - which creationists do accept - \"working together\" to enable a species to survive by \"adapting it\" to the environment (there is no intelligence involved in the processes of natural selection and mutations). But note: the population as a whole has LOST genetic information, i.e. they have lost the genetic information (DNA) to produce wings. In the creation model, species can decrease in complexity, never increase and change into any other kind. This is a result of the curse that God placed on the WHOLE creation after Adam sinned, (Genesis 3). God released some of His sustaining power on His creation and decay set in. Things run down, mutations reck information. This is why species decrease and can never increase in complexity. Sometimes, species change through reshuffling of the genetic information - NOTE: this is not increasing the amount of genetic information (DNA) in the genome - and this is also accomodated in the creation model.\n \n Not let us examine mutations. Consider the TNR mutant. The Totally Naked Rooster. What has the mutation done? It has destroyed the genetic information (DNA) for making feathers. Has the rooster ever been improved by the mutation? Of course not. The mutation has destroyed information, it hasn't added any information, and definitely hasn't added any new useful information, i.e. increasing amount of genetic information. In addition to this mutation, Dr Lee Spetner (an Israeli biophysicist) in his book \"Not By Chance!\" demolishes the NeoDarwinian belief that mutations can add the information needed for real evolution, i.e. increasing complexity to get less complex organisms into more complex organisms. He has published extensively on the technical and mathematical aspects of evolutionary genetics and shows in clear, understandable detail that genuine point mutations are all, without exception, losses of genetic information. He says, \"One cannot point to a single mutation that can be seen to add any new information to the genome\" and that \"All point mutations when studied on the molecular level turn out to reduce the amount of genetic information\". \n \n These mean that evolution of increasing complexity cannot proceed as there is no known source for new genetic information required to evolve a microorganism into something as complex as a human or a horse, say.\n \n And when I check out their claims, which you advise to do in the case of evolutionist arguments, I find that my suspicions are justified. \n \n You must not search that hard then (in part my ill attempt at humour) ;-D I will take your advice on board. It all depends on what starting assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reach and as to how reasonable other interpretations are, as discussed in my previous post.\n \n I just had to comment on the trust you are placing on certain people simply because they claim to be Christians, and the accusations of lying that you are making toward others who merely disagree with you. \n \n I am sorry if I gave you the impression that I think that all atheists in general are liars. That was not my intention. I consider Talk Origins to be decievers/liars, but I do not consider you, or my friends to be liars. Some evolutionists do purposely set out to decieve people with frauds (such as some of the countless so called ape men, the embryonic recapitulation and so on) and it is these people that I am attacking. I never intended to put all atheists and evolutionists under a sort of \"sterotypical view\" or under the same name. Sorry if you thought that that was my aim. \n \n ...if you make a blanket statement like \"atheists are liars\" without any real reasons...And don't assume someone is dishonest or biased simply because they disagree with you. \n \n My apologies if I insulted or gave this impression stated above to anyone. It was not my intention. Once again sorry. I will be more specific next time. I do acknowledge and respect that many people have different opinions and I don't intend to blanket all atheists under the same blanket of being liars and so forth as I know quite a few good people who are atheists. As before, I am also sorry about the length of my post. Wish I could keep it short and sweet - have a little problem with doing that.",

The board is not moderated, so, as you can see, flame wars break out quite easily. Despite that, it is one of my favorite boards. I post there as warren, by the way. But if you want to post there, you better have a thick skin.\n \n As far as my comments on AiG, there are only such posts there at this moment. The NAiG board only holds a certain number of messages, so as more messages are posted, old ones disappear. That is why I am not posting any links to any of the posts - I don't want to post a link that is going to go dead.\n \n Anyway, I have two posts there concerning AiG articles. One, titled \"Don't make me laugh\" and dated May 12 is just a nonscientific comment on AiG's nonscientific position that morality shouldn't exist if evolution is true. It may not be interesting to most people.\n \n A longer post that concerns scientific matters is titled \"Let me know when you get tired of this\" dated May 13.\n \n Perhaps the next time I feel inspired to comment on an AiG article, I will write my comments here, and you can comment on my comments.",

   "Where does 'science' say we come from? Well, which 'science'?\n \n There are many different sciences, taught throughout the world as 'science'. \n \n \"Presently, curriculum designers around the world may differ in their views about topics to include in the science curriculum. However, they almost all would include the nature of science in science curriculum (American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1989; Hazen & Trefil, 1991; Lederman, 1992; and Rutherford & Ahlgren, 1990).\"\n http://www.balfakih.net/epistemology.htm\n \n That is, for instance, some countries teach a different science... such as (Marxist) Science.

This is evidenced by gender bias in scientific papers.\n \"Narrative conventions form part of scientific description. These are forms of words that are typical of a particular thought process.

   "Hello, Montalban. Welcome back.\n \n Science, at least in a very simplistic description, is the process of understanding the natural world through the testing of hypotheses about the natural world by comparing predictions based on these hypotheses with actual observations.

   "Hello, Montalban.\n \n I have given my version of the definition of the theory of evolution. As far as I know, there are no other \"theories of evolution\" used in biology today.\n \n What is currently being studied, researched, and debated is the exact manner in which various species evolved, and what were the environmental pressures that these species were experiencing.\n \n For example, for human evolution, there are still many unanswered questions. One question is: did a population of Homo erectus (or H. ergaster - there is now some re-evaluation of the kinship relations of the various fossil species) in Africa evolve into H. sapiens, which then spread out of Africa into the rest of the world, or did the entire population of H. erectus all over the old world evolve in H. sapiens together as a single species. This isn't so much a different theory of evolution but different hypotheses as to the nature of the evolution of the human species. It's the same theory of evolution, but the difference is how to apply the theory to this one particular example.\n \n Then there are questions as to timing and speed of evolution - the difference between, say, puctuated equilibrium vs. a more stereoptyped gradualism. The theory of evolution is the same, the difference is in what are the mechanisms which causes rapid vs slow speciation. Related to this is the question which lineages evolve in a somewhat linear manner and which experienced a burst of \"adaptive radiation\" - the same theory of evolution applies to each, the question is how to interpret the evidence so as to give a reasonable picture of the results of the evolutionary process.\n \n If I'm not mistaken, your main points is:\n \nThus when people on this and other posts say that they support 'Evolution' I wonder if they know what they mean by it... especially as they oft put forward an argument against religion - that religion must be false, because there are so many of them. (they all can't be true).\n\n Competing hypotheses can coexist together in science until definitive evidence comes along to eliminate one or the other possibility. Although competing theories can have their partisan supporters (and, yes, the arguments can get quite heated, even among \"objective\" scientists), in general even when a scientist supports on hypothesis over the others, she will acknowledge the other hypotheses exist and she will acknowledge the evidence that supports it.\n \n No one ever argues that a religion is false because other, competing religions exist. What is being refuted is a particular argument in favor of a specific religion. Many adherents of some religions, like Christian Protestant fundamentalist, refuse the acknowledge the validity of other religions or that their own religion might be wrong. What is being objected to is when such a sectarian partisan says, \"My religion is the true religion because it has characteristics x, y, and z.\" What is being pointed out is that other religions also have characteristics x, y, and z, so by that standard these religions must also be true. Since, the sectarian insists that only theirs is the true religion, this produces a contradiction.",

Although competing theories can have their partisan supporters (and, yes, the arguments can get quite heated, even among \"objective\" scientists), in general even when a scientist supports on hypothesis over the others, she will acknowledge the other hypotheses exist and she will acknowledge the evidence that supports it.\n \n No one ever argues that a religion is false because other, competing religions exist. What is being refuted is a particular argument in favor of a specific religion. Many adherents of some religions, like Christian Protestant fundamentalist, refuse the acknowledge the validity of other religions or that their own religion might be wrong. What is being objected to is when such a sectarian partisan says, \"My religion is the true religion because it has characteristics x, y, and z.\" What is being pointed out is that other religions also have characteristics x, y, and z, so by that standard these religions must also be true. Since, the sectarian insists that only theirs is the true religion, this produces a contradiction.\n\n \n That's close to my main point. In part my criticism of evolution is the reverse of your understanding of Protestantism (though I'm no Protestant).\n \n You say that they believe that only they hold the truth, and everyone else is wrong (within certain limits - say Catholics might be half right)\n \n Evolution says that it holds no understanding of truth, and that all theories (within limits) are true or possibly true, or equally valid - whichever term satisfies you.\n \n The limitations that I see most applied to evolution is that the process doesn't involve God.\n \n Thus a leading scientist such as Crick can believe in panspermia... specifically he stated the option that life on earth began when aliens built giant space-ships and these contained the building blocks for life, and one landed/crashed on earth... which of course begs the question 'where did the aliens come from'... but it can still fit/be accepted by evolutionary science because it doesn't involve the supernatural... no matter how silly it is.\n \n \n \n What do you know of 'devolution'?",

   "...with rational science we can show that\n \n Man and Neanderthal were separate species that never crossed (in genetic terms)\n \n That Man and Neanderthal never did, but could have - therefore blurring the idea of 'separete species'\n \n That Man and Neanderthal actually did do so.\n \n We have the evidences for all three/ or two if you count the first two the same. Even though they be mutually exclusive.\n\n \n I'm not sure what you mean, here. You can't really prove a negative, so to formulate this question, one would have to propose a scientifict hypothesis:\n \n Modern humans and Neanderthals were the same species and could interbreed. One would then make predictions of observations we should see if this hypothesis was, indeed, an accurate description of reality. If we see phenomena that we predict we would call this confirmation of the hypothesis, and it would be more believable. If the predicted phenomena were never observed, we would, in the very least, have to accept that the alternative, that Neanderthals and Modern Humans were different species, is valid. And if we couldn't come up with a reasonable explanation as to why we didn't see the phenomena, we may even be inclined to abandon the positive hypothesis and accept the alternative.\n \n Now, take the hypothesis: Modern Humans and Neanderthals are the same species.\n \n Predictions: we should see, in the archeaological record (I'm not sure whether \"fossil\" is the appropriate term here, seeing how recent this is), we should see signs of interbreeding. We should see remains of humans with physical characteristics intermediate between humans and Neanderthals. We should see evidence of genetic relatedness of Neanderthals and Modern Humans.\n \n We do not see this evidence. There are very, very few humans remains that show intermediate characteristics; those that do are very, very rare and are controversial. The genetic evidence seems to indicate that Neanderthals were a side branch of humans that never contributed their genetic material to Modern Humans.\n \n So, there is no reason to accept the hypothesis that Neanderthals and Modern Humans are the same species. Do we have reason to abandon it completely? What would prevent observing the predicted phenomena?\n \n One reason that would prevent the predicted phenomena is that the preservation of remains would be rare. How complete is the archaeological record of the relavant time period? How many Neanderthal remains do we find? How many Modern Human remains do we find? Is the lack of Neanderthal/Modern intermediates a reasonable given what we do find?\n \n Another reason that may prevent find intermediates is that Modern Humans and Neanderthals were never in the same geographic area at the same time and simply did not have the opportunity to interbreed. Is this viable? Can we date the remains that we find accurately enough?\n \n Anyway, this is how science is done. And, when the data is sparse, or when the data seems to give contradictory conclusions, then it isn't surprising that sometimes several hypotheses can exist side-by-side. In a case such as this, it is necessary to refine each hypothesis, to refine the predictions made, and to collect more data.\n \n I take it you haven't read much in the way of the history of science. All the scientific fields go through this, and in each of the scientific fields right now there exist mutually exclusive competing theories. That is the nature of science - we never have all the answers. But in the case of the Neanderthal/Modern Human question, each of the hypotheses are consistent with the theory of evolution, and each is consistent with the general theory of how modern humans evolved. The only question is about particular detail about the history of humans in one particular region of the world.",

He suggests that because a project becomes so large, no one scientist is an expert on all matters of the project; therefore there is a reliance upon the expertise of others in the project. \"This leads Hardwig to ask two questions, one about the evidential status of testimony, and one about the nature of the knowing subject in these cases. With respect to the latter, Hardwig says that either the group as a whole, but no single member, knows or it is possible to know vicariously. Neither of these is palatable to him. Talking about the group or the community knowing smacks of superorganisms and transcendent entities and Hardwig shrinks from that solution. Vicarious knowledge, knowing without oneself possessing the evidence for the truth of what one knows, requires, according to Hardwig, too much of a departure from our ordinary concepts of knowledge.\" \n \n Ibid.\n \n Errors present themselves through social constructs and normative notions of the scientists themselves.

I am not about trying to convince you of the truth of Orthodoxy. I don't have either the time of the facilities. I can answer you specifically why I came to Orthodoxy. One was through studying history.\n \n The Didache, for example, shows the first Christians practicing using the Eucharist.

This is what Satan first tried... tricking Adam into believing that he could be like God.\n \n It seems to be your job to undermine a belief in one truth, and therefore if you have more than one comepting 'truths' then they can't be true in any absolute sense.\n \n \nI think it is part though of this cult of Man and that is dangerous. \n\n \n \nBut the Bible has also been part of cults that you and I both would despise.

This is part of the deception that I told you about.\n \n \n \n \n +\n I wrote the following in an argument with a site that claims to be anti-Orthodox. On it they state that the canon of the New Testament was established in the time of the Apostles... In a small way it deals with the some aspects of the early church - which leads to the question of authority. They had authority, they had the authority to compile the Bible. They had authority to teach.\n \n \n Sir/Madam,\n \n Thank you for your reply, which directs me to several sites. I looked at the first two\n \n http://www.exorthodoxforchrist.com/bible_canon.htm \n \n and\n \n http://www.exorthodoxforchrist.com/canon_-_facts.htm \n \n which are to my limited capacity, essentially the same.\n \n \n \n They state ?So Who (sic) decided the Cannon of the New Testament ? The short answer is: the Apostles and other Disciples of Christ who worked with the Apostles.?\n \n \n \n Essentially you then create a longer version of this sentence, but I in either explanation, I found no evidence, just you stating what you believed to be so.\n \n \n \n It states ?The Apostles had been faithful to their task. They had trained local Pastors, established independent Bible believing congregations. Each of these churches had copies of the parchments, scrolls and papyri that are the passages of the Greek New Testament, that today we continue to find all over the world.\n \n \n \n So The Apostles & Disciples of Jesus Christ are the ones who had control over the books of the Bible and that cannon, and they are the ones who made the decision of what to omit and what to include.?\n \n \n \n If this were so, then we would find amongst early Christians little or no dispute about which books should be included. At another site (http://www.bible-researcher.com/canon3.html) we in fact see disagreement between Athanasius, Origen, Irenaeus and Marcion. (It is Marcion to whom we know produced the very first list/collection of books ? a Bible).\n \n \n \n I think what you state is put by you because you are looking at this retrospectively, that is, you (and I) recognize that certain books were written at or about the time of the first Apostles, however, this does not mean that these books were combined together to form a Biblical canon. Herein I think lies a mistake you have made. You see that, for instance, the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were written at a certain time, and that these are now in the Bible, therefore the canon of the Bible was settled at the time the books were composed. This simply is not the case. Yes, now we can say that these parts of the Bible were established at a particular date, but, they were not yet in a Bible until three hundred years later.\n \n \n \n If I pick up an anthology of Shakespeare; knowing that the plays were written in the time of the great bard is a totally different matter to saying that the anthology was compiled in his time too! I think you would be trying to argue in this case that the anthology is as old as the books contained therein? which is illogical. (but you seem to be doing so, with regards the New Testament canon).\n \n \n Evidence (http://www.bible-researcher.com/canon5.html) shows that there were ?disputed? books. The ?true? books were around, but they weren?t yet determined by the Church which were true and which were false, until much later after they were written.\n \n \n \n ?In A.D. 393, the Synod of Hippo officially listed the 27 books of the New Testament, which had already been widely accepted in practice.?\n \n http://www.literatureclassics.com/ancientpaths/bibhist.html\n \n \n \n This ?need to canoninse? was done simply because there was a vast number of books in circulation, and the Gnostics were claiming were using these false books for their own ends (http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/NTcanon.html), to which end ?In the year 367 an influential bishop named Athanasius published a list of books to be read in the churches under his care, which included precisely those books we have in our Bibles?\n \n http://www.bible-researcher.com/canon1.html\n \n \n \n Most telling is?\n \n ?Other such lists had been published by others, as early as the year 170, although they did not all agree?\n \n Ibid.\n \n \n \n To use another analogy, if I may, it is like a court scenario. We have a magistrate who is presented with a large corpus of material, but must wade through it to determine truth from untruth. One can then, retrospectively say that ?Exhibit A? was ?always? true, but it needed a judge to determine this.\n \n \n \n On another note, you did not address the usage of the Eucharist, to which I mentioned. I gave evidence that quite clearly shows the early church operating in a liturgical environment ? even the pagans saw them partaking of the Body of Christ (Eucharist).\n \n \n \n I did show both church and pagan evidence, witnesses to the liturgical life of early Christians. Even if the canon of the Bible were in fact fixed when you believe it to have been, this still does not detract from my argument that the Word of God can be interpreted in any number of ways. (Evidenced by the great many peoples around the world who use the Bible to their own ends ? even Moslems will use the Bible to say that it predicts Muhammed). Given the divers interpretations available, one needs to look for other evidences, to see how early Christians did in fact interpret it. And, as just shown as a case in point, they seem to have interpreted the Last Supper in a sacramental way ? not as can be interpreted by non-liturgical Christians as a mere symbolic meal of rememberence.\n \n \n \n Instead you make a claim about the hidden texts of the first three Ecumenical Councils, where-by you say?\n \n ?We do not believe that the EOC actually wishes to disclose the contents of the first 3 Church Councils.?\n \n \n \n You may wish to visit \n \n http://members.aol.com/DSeraphim/1.html\n \n or\n \n http://www.wirnowski.com/Orthodoxy/B_EcCouncils.html\n \n for a start, I don?t know if this satisfies your thirst for information, or not. (These are sites containing the same information, but they do give one reference to a book)\n \n \n \n However, I believe a fuller account is given at http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/nicea1.txt\n \n \n \n With kind regards from an antipodean,\n \n Montalban (I actually gave them my real name)",

Even if the woman experienced an orgasm, she was said to be deceiving her self.... \"That even in a woman's sexuality, there is deceit on the part of men, and complacency on the part of some women\" in Koedt, A. \"The Myth of Vaginal Orgasm.\" \n in Koedt, A. & Levine, E. & Rapone, A., (eds.). (1973). \"Radical Feminism\". Quadrangle Books, New York, p204\n \n They produced the science to back them up, showing the physical proximity of the clitoris to the vagina, to say that the distance was insurmountable (not an attempt at a pun).\n \n Darwin* and many of his ilk believed that women were naturally meek, mild and home-orientated. They attributed 'essentialist' ideas to women, and to evolution the cause of women being as they 'are'. And of course, they found the science to prove these gendered biased notions.\n \n Now the reverse is true, where feminists are finding evidence to show that in the process of fertilisation, the egg actually hauls in the sperm - rather than meekly wait for it.\n Exemplifying this claim in the book is an essay by anthropologist Emily Martin, who says that both popular and scientific accounts of the behaviour of human egg and sperm in the reproductive process rely on stereotypes. According to her, these are stereotypes that \"imply not only that female biological processes are less worthy than their male counterparts but also that women are less worthy than men.\n In a popular recounting of the same subject, reporter Sharon Begley wrote in Newsweek (April 21, 1997) that biologists in the 1960s portrayed sperm as active, \"macho adventurers,\" eggs as passive, \"coy damsels.\" According to the article, it was only recently discovered that \"sperm are ineffectual swimmers\" and that \"the egg actively grabbed the sperm.\" Begley acknowledged that by 1964, researchers knew that the early development of the fertilized cell was guided by genetic material of the egg, but she quoted Martin as saying that \"no one knew what to do\" with this research.\n Are these charges of masculinist bias in scientific accounts valid? In a recent (October 1997) debate at the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C., Gross gave a scathing response. He noted that research published as early as 1878 and 1919 clearly described the egg as actively engulfing and pulling in the sperm, and that since then, the egg's role has not been considered passive \"in any scientifically meaningful way.\" And he reaffirmed the scientific observation that sperm do swim.?\n http://members.tripod.com/~ScienceWars/cult.html\n \n *Darwin postulated that females are ''coy,'' mating rarely and choosing their mates carefully, presumably betting their odds on the males with the best genes to contribute to their offspring. For their part, males are ''ardent'' and promiscuous, and fight amongst themselves for female partners. Later theories added that males are promiscuous because they have less to lose by making babies - unlike eggs, sperm are plentiful and small. Plus, females usually do most of the work to raise the offspring?\n http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_relea...u-sag021003.php",

   "Nor am I an advocate of authority or over-reliance of tradition to the interpretations of texts. As I said, spiritual truths must come from within. It is all very well it listen to what your teachers have to say, but what they say must be confirmed by what is within yourself.\n \n \n \n Not necessarily a bad thing.\n \n\n \n Saint Gregory Nazianzen put it when speaking of pagan literature: \"As we have compounded healthful drugs from certain of the reptiles, so from secular literature we have received principles of enquiry and speculation, while we have rejected their idolatry...\" 1)\n \n Thus we come sadly to the modern western mind; we have become obsessed with rationalism, at the expense of purer faith. The modern mind has accepted the idolatory (in this case the worship of Man). \n \n 'The' truths are kept through Holy Tradition.\n \n But what are traditions? There was oral teachings, and written teachings. \n ?Besides the Oral Gospels, the Diatessaron served as an alternate Gospel. The Diatessaron was a harmony of the four gospels, written c. 150-160 by Tatian. It circulated widely in Syriac-speaking churches-it was their standard text of the gospels until it was superseded by the Peshitta in the fifth century. The Diatessaron's use shows that the four gospels were considered important authorities, but not exclusive authorities. The Diatessaron by itself constituted as the New Testament scriptures for the Syrian churches until the fourteen Pauline epistles were added in the third century? 2)\n \n Incidentally, there is a basis for oral traditions to be found in the Bible, as St. Paul wrote?\n Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word [i.e. oral tradition] or our epistle (II Thessalonians 2:15). 3)\n \n The faith of the Fathers is as it was taught by Jesus, it is as it is within the Orthodox faith, which has held fast to these teachings.\n \n Asides from the traditions, there are the forms of worship that the Orthodox Church has kept.\n \n The Book of Acts shows the consecration of Holy Orders; the worship of God in observed hours of prayer (Acts 3:1); they worshiped in the Temple (Acts 2:46, 3:1, 21:26); and they worshiped in Synagogues (Acts 18:4).\n \n St. Paul continually called the people to one single faith?\n ?\"There is one body\" (Eph. 4: 4). The body is the church, Paul explains (Eph. 1: 22, 23). Jesus did not overcome hades to build different churches (Matt. 16: 18). While there are many local churches, God's people meeting in different geographic locations, these churches are supposed to be the same in doctrine and practice. This is why Paul could \"teach every where in every church\" in the First Century (I Cor. 4: 17). Their standard to uniformly accept or reject was (is) the \"doctrine of Christ\" (2 Jn. 9-11).\n \n \"There is one Spirit.\" The Holy Spirit gave man the total truth through the apostles (Jn. 14: 26, 16: 13). It is He who is attributed with the unity (vs. 3). The Spirit demands that Christians defend and guard the truth (Jude 3; 2 Jn. 9-11).\n \n \"Called in one hope of your calling.\" There are not multitudinous hopes involved in the Christian's calling (2 Thes. 2: 14). The hope is heaven (Heb. 6: 18, 19). Man comes along, though, and inserts the hope of \"one day being a god himself\" or \"living eternally on this earth.\" Hence, division is experienced instead of unity.\n \n \"One Lord\" (vs. 5). Since there is only one Jesus and he is Lord, unity should follow. Jesus himself is consistent (Heb. 13: 8). As Lord (kurios), he demands man's obedience to his teaching (Lk. 6: 46, Jn. 12: 48).\n \n \"One faith.\" The \"one faith\" is the gospel system (Jude 3). This is what Luke meant when he wrote, \"and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith\" (Acts 6: 7). It is indeed sad that there are literally thousands of faiths today. In such an atmosphere of many, there cannot be unity. The New Testament constitutes the Christian's belief system, every thing else is condemned (Matt. 15: 1 ff). This is why if the Christian does not abide in the doctrine of Christ, he does not have God (2 Jn. 9). Man is forbidden to change in any way \"the faith\" (Gal. 1: 6-9, Rev. 22: 18, 19).\n \n \"One baptism.\" There are a number of baptisms mentioned in the New Testament, the baptism of John, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and the baptism introduced in Acts 2, for instance. However, at the time of the penning of these words, there is only one baptism. The one baptism is the universal baptism in water for the remission of sins, as set forth in the Great Commission and exemplified throughout the New Testament (Mk. 16: 15, 16, Acts 2: 38). Peter clearly shows that the baptism associated with man's salvation is water baptism (I Pet. 3: 20, 21).\n \n \"One God\" (vs. 6). Just as there are only one Spirit and Lord; there is only one God the Father. While the Godhead, state of being God, is made up of three, separate individualities, if you will, the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, they are one in unison and purpose (Jn. 14: 8 ff.).? 4)\n \n Other examples can be found\n Ephesians 4:13\n until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.\n \n Romans 15:5\n May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus,\n \n And less so at\n Colossians 3:14\n And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.\n \n St. Ignatius of Antioch, writing to the Ephesians said?\n 5:1 For if I in a short time had such converse with your bishop, which was not after the manner of men but in the Spirit, how much more do I congratulate you who are closely joined with him as the Church is with Jesus Christ and as Jesus Christ is with the Father, that all things may be harmonious in unity. 5)\n \n As to Holy Orders, again, we can look to St. Ignatius who wrote to the Magnesians\n 2:1 Forasmuch then as I was permitted to see you in the person of Damas your godly bishop and your worthy presbyters Bassus and Apollonius and my fellow-servant the deacon Zotion, of whom I would fain have joy, for that he is subject to the bishop as unto the grace of God and to the presbytery as unto the law of Jesus Christ: 6)\n Note, your relation to your bishop is as your relationship to God.\n \n Endnotes.\n 1) St. Gregory Nazianzen, \"Oration 43, Panegyric on Saint Basil,\" A Selected Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, series 2, vol. vii, eds.

The word itself literally means \"what is transmitted.\" It is the same word used when referring negatively to the false teachings of the Pharisees (Mark 7:3, 5, 8), and also when referring to authoritative Christian teaching (I Corinthians 11:2, Second Thessalonians 2:15). So what makes the tradition of the Pharisees false and that of the Church true? The source! Christ made clear what was the source of the traditions of the Pharisees when He called them \"the traditions of men\" (Mark 7:8). Saint Paul on the other hand, in reference to Christian Tradition states, \"I praise you brethren, that you remember me in all things and hold fast to the traditions [paradoseis] just as I delivered [paredoka, a verbal form of paradosis] them to you\" (First Corinthians 11:2), but where did he get these traditions in the first place? \"I received from the Lord that which I delivered [paredoka] to you\" (first Corinthians 11:23). This is what the Orthodox Church refers to when it speaks of the Apostolic Tradition ? \"the Faith once delivered [paradotheise] unto the saints\" (Jude 3). Its source is Christ, it was delivered personally by Him to the Apostles through all that He said and did, which if it all were all written down, \"the world itself could not contain the books that should be written\" (John 21:25). The Apostles delivered this knowldge to the entire Church, and the Church, being the repository of this treasure thus became \"the pillar and ground of the Truth\" (I Timothy 3:15). \n 4) http://orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/tca_solascriptura.htm\n 5) http://www.bibletruths.net/archives/BTARO78.htm\n 6) http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-ephesians-lightfoot.html\n 7) http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-magnesians-lightfoot.html",

   "?Whereas the most reputable developments in German physics and engineering during the Third Reich took place under the Nazi regime but were not intrinsically Nazi, the cutting edge biomedical sciences under the swastika were quintessentially National Socialist. While both sets of communities served the Nazi state, only the German biomedical community deserves ethical condemnation.? \n http://www.clarkson.edu/~zhangjj/projects/naziscience.htm\n \n \nNazis called it science but unless you give me a nazi hypothesis and how they tested it then it is not science.\n\n \n I'm afraid that you will always just say 'it's not science'. At least others here have understood values and science... even if they don't agree with the extent of cross-over.\n \n Perhaps other people will understand this then...\n \n For starters; when Nazis did experiments on live humans - for example, to see how tolerant we are of extremes of heat and cold, these were done very scientifically. The Nazi ideology, however was what caused these scientific experiments to be undertaken in the first place - that a Christians might not have performed an experiment knowing that the subject would die.\n http://remember.org/educate/medexp.html\n \n It was such 'good' science that the data is still applicable, but only because of ethics, it is debatable whether we should ever use it\n see http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/NaziMedEx.html\n or\n http://www.stanford.edu/group/STS/techne4.shtml\n Should we? If we remove the Judeo-Christian 'ethics' and just have a 'pure' science, then surely we must! Thus some scientists won't touch this scientific data because of their own ethical beliefs, not because it is 'science'.\n \n If you have Judeo-Christian ethics, then you'd never perform such 'science', but if you're a Nazi, then you would. It is still 'science', as it is following scientific method.\n \n There's more info about the medical experiments at http://remember.org/imagine/doctors.html\n \n What about...\n \"Letter from Dr. Wurm, of the Wuerttemberg Evangelical Provincial Church, to Reich Minister of interior Dr. Frick, September 5 1940.\n Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression - Washington, U.S Govt. Print. Off., 1946, Supp. A, p. 1223.\n \n Dear Reich Minister, \n \n On July 19th I sent you a letter about the systematic extermination of lunatics, feeble-minded and epileptic persons. Since then this practice has reached tremendous proportions: recently the inmates of old-age homes have also been included. The basis for this practice seems to be that in an efficient nation there should be no room for weak and frail people. It is evident from the many reports which we are receiving that the people's feelings are being badly hurt by the measures ordered and that the feeling of legal insecurity is spreading which is regrettable from the point of view of national and state interest.\"\n http://fcit.coedu.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/document/DocEuth.htm\n \n Note that the people's 'ethics' were actually causing problems to the 'science' (though the 'ethics' of the scientists conducting the exterminations also did exist - just that their ethics allowed for it). Surely, you would advocate for using this data, as you want to have a world based on pure science, with no ethics.\n \n Note also the quote I gave at the beginning... it's not the 'science' that's in question - it's all quite 'scienfitic' it's the ethics of the science... experimenting on a human is 'scientific', but it's couched in a certain ideology as to whether this is acceptable or not.\n \n Less clear, and hence I've avoided it, are many of the Nazi scientific notions regarding race... which you'd just carte blache declare unscientific... that would be easy.\n \n But I direct you to cast your gaze to\n Barkan, Elazar, 1992.

You just assume that the science you learn is 'science'. It is easier for you to understand about Nazi science being subjective, because it is called 'Nazi science'. They would have called your science 'Capitalist science'.\n \n You simply have the mistaken belief that your own system is the norm, and that any thing else is the Other. (in sociological terms).\n \n \nAs for darwin saying women choose there mates carefully I believe him. If our initial observations that cause us to claim women are pickier when it comes to sex it just means our initial observations are wrong. If it is because we are sexist then then its our inherint flaws making us do that and not the science. I don't see why it is such a crime to think of women as less promiscuous as men because it does not make me hate women or refuse to consider them for employment or think of promiscuous women as \"dirty\".\n\n \n I don't think one way or the other is any more right or wrong... I am simply stating that as our societal norms change, science is found to back up our stances. You seem to have missed this, and I have no better way of showing this.\n \n Darwin had, what we would term 'sexist' ideas, and science showed this at the time; that women were meek. Now that we are considerd more equal; the sexes, we find science that shows this too.\n \n Capitalist evolution focuses on the individual, Marxist evolution does not.\n \n \"In Marxism, groups are more important than individuals. Capitalists view nature as competitive, whereas these Marxist critics tend to view it as being much more cooperative.\"\n http://www.stephenjaygould.org/revi...ciobiology.html\n \n They are both sciences.\n \n Do you know anything about Marxian* theories of science? They can argue for instance that one of the first things that set us apart from the apes is the use of the hand in tool building -that is, the means of production. It is true that they are biased in their science, but to dismiss it as un-scientific is false, as it follows scientific method. They have a different take on the notion of genes, such as the 'selfish gene', influenced by their political outlook. This is no different from your own versions of science, only they are conscious of it, you are not.\n Look at http://www.marxist.com/rircontents.asp (with particular focus at Part Three) and tell me if it's unscientific.\n \n Science itself is ?male-orientated? (http://www.nature.com/nature/debate...n_contents.html) and culturally biased (http://www.cis.vt.edu/sage/journal/ ?The Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering? was created to over-come this.). It is filled with these biases, no matter how ?empirical? the evidence may seem.\n \n \n \n One online debater summed it up well??Postmodern thinkers have also drawn attention to the fact that what poses as objectivity is often pervaded with bias, and that science can never escape this, no matter how strictly it defines its epistemology?\n \n http://www.directionjournal.com/ale...s/belief01.html\n \n See also http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/s...owledge-social/ which has a very good account of the knowledge of science.\n \n \n \n Thus Evolution reflects in part the minds of the people interpreting it. This is recognised by feminists who include courses to make people more aware of gender bias in science formation.\n \n One course asks?\n \n ?How has sexist (racist, classist) bias influenced the practice, results, and political uses of science? To what extent is scientific inquiry and, by extension scientific knowledge, objective, rational, reliable? Is science primarily a social activity? How might a feminist political agenda change, improve scientific inquiry, knowledge, and practice??\n \n http://www.haverford.edu/femgenstudies/Brokes.html and includes for reading Belk, C.M. 2000. ?Gender bias in biological theory formation.

I have no desire to repeat/detail a particular experiment here,* for I have ethics regarding how that information was obtained, as do a great many scientists. I gave you ample quotes to show scientists are debating the ethics of using the information - not the information itself! You disagree with them, then so be it. I know it's hard for you to believe it, so hard that even when a huge corps of scientists accept the 'science' of the data, you can't.\n \n However, in effect, with regards to the 'science' behind these experiments, you are in disagreement with modern scientists! Thus you could not possibly be convinced as these scientists opinions mean nothing to you. It is an odd twist in this debate that I am deferring to the opinion of scientific experts, and you are not! Your position is based simply on your wish to create a dichotomy where one does not exist. It is based on how you wish science to be, and not how it is.\n \n As I stated, the experiments followed scientific methods and the results are so 'scientific' that the debate rages whether to use this information, not over the strengths of the science, but over the ethics of how it was obtained. The information is, devoid of any Judeo-Christian ethics, 'useful'.\n \n As with you, when dealing with science, I rely on their authority - in this case. They accept the data as being potentially useful - the only problem being the ethics.\n \n Further to this I gave numerous sources from current and recent studies on extant scientific theories. From feminist and Marxian critiques I drew information showing that mainstream science is value-ridden. Conveniently, you ignored this in toto.\n \n I thus direct the remainder of this to those who accept these scientists beliefs.\n \n There is a very good article\n Nazi Medicine and Public Health Policy\n http://www.adl.org/Braun/dim_14_1_nazi_med.asp\n which deals with the bunk that Nazis did not use scientific methodology.\n \n It shows that science was tainted with an evil ideology (as opposed to the non-evil ideologies that taint western science at present)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n *there is a very brief over-view of the different types of experiments to be found at\n http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/deathcamps.html\n \n and a more specialised look into experiments at\n http://www1.us.nizkor.org/hweb/camps/dachau/dachau-004.html\n \n and Mengele's Research (the twin studies) at\n http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/history/mengele/research_5.html?sect=6\n \n There is a brief link to Mengele and other scientists at\n http://www.shoah.dk/doctors/mengele.htm\n \n and at a horrific look into Mengele\n http://www.auschwitz.dk/Mengele/\n \n FURTHER DISCLAIMER\n I will not, because of ethics publish here any of the actual detailed experiments. I have made a mistake in the past with regards to providing information - I debated one poster who claimed that all paedophile sites were run by homosexuals. I then published a site for a so-called 'help-group' in Denmark, which was decidedly heterosexual. Although this meant that I undermined my opponents argument, I actually unwittingly gave publicity to this site, which was a dangerous and stupid thing to do on a forum that is open to children.\n I will not do so here again, even should Close_slave_can deem this a victory to his argument. I have instead published sites by scientists who themselves know of the Nazi's experiments and agree with the science of these experiments.\n I will not go further to 'win' this argument.",

You just have to replace opinions with the word science. \n \n Going into full detail \n \n \n I am using a different definition of science than you. Under my definition for something to be scientific you have to come up with testable claims and then test them. People do come up theorems that produce testable claims and people test them. What word would you use for this? And how do Mengele experiments show testing claims is wrong? \n \n I will explain my problem I had with the way you phrased things from the very beginning. In the likely event I am misinterpreting I apologise in advance.\n All from your talk about \"nazi science\" and \"marxist science\" and \"feminist science\" suggest that your definition of \"nazi science\" is the belief set of nazis, you define \"feminist science\" as the belief set of feminists. \n You also talk about Mengele and his \"nazi science\" as being horrific.

Very true but so what? The disturbing parts of the Nazi belief set were not obtained using the scientific method unless some of Mengele caused the nazi party to spring into being. I have read some of the links you gave me but they don't address this issue so I did not acknowledge them. I fully acknowledge that being a scientist doesn't stop you doing the wrong thing but neither does wearing shoes. I will keep both shoes and my science books.",

You are so dead-set in the idea that science is above all, that you've not been able to see the affect of ideology, and this is because your own ideology won't allow it.\n \n Good night.\n \n \n *Or is that fowl?

   "\"When we read in Bouchet about miracles associated with the relics of Saint Hilary we chan shrug it off: His right to be believed is not great enough to take away our freedom to challenge him. But to go on from there and condemn all similar accounts seems to me to be impudent in the extreme. Such a great saint as Augustine swears that he saw: a blind child restored to sight by the relics of Saint Gervaise and Saint Protasius at Milan; a woman in Carthage cured of a cancer by the sign of the cross made by a woman who had just been baptised; his close friend Hesperius driving off devils (who were infesting his house) by using a little soil taken from the sepulchre of our Lord, and that same soil, borne into the Church, suddenly curing a paralytic; a woman who, having touched the reliquary of Saint Stephen with a posy of flowers during a procession, rubbed her eyes with them afterwards and recovered her sight which she had recently lost... What are we to accuse him of - hum and the two holy bishops, Aurelius and Maximinus, whom he calls on as witnesses? Is it of ignorance, simple-mindedness, credulity, deliberate deception or imposture? .... 'Qui, ut rationem mullan afferent, ipsa auhtoritate me frangerent (Why, even if they gave no reasons, they would convince me by their very authority) \n Michel de Montaigne in \"That it is madness to judge the true and the false from our own capacities\"\n \n When the source is trustworthy, then even the miraculous can be believed. I have no greater authority that that of Jesus Christ, who transmuted His teachings to His church, and this church has held firm to these teachings.\n \n \nI can question authority when its teachings are counter to common sense evidence. The point in these forums is that there is a lot of evidence in favor of evolution. It is this evidence that needs to be refuted in some manner. As long as the evidence is compelling, any authority that ignores the evidence and teaches a doctrine in opposition to it is simply wrong.\n\n \n The evidence is refuted. It is refuted by authority of the Church. You choose to say that the evidence is 'compelling' when evolution - your form of it - can't even agree with 'how?' 'where', or 'when', only that it 'did' happen. You accept in part that the evidences can be influenced by a priori knowledge, and you also question 'authority' without understanding it - another of your admissions.\n \n I've shown you, and you've agreed that evidence moves all the time (although you believe that this doesn't matter, because 'evolution' as a whole is still true*)\n \n In summary, you're basing your faith on a shifting science - what is 'true' now, is not going to be 'true' tomorrow. That science is severely limited to only that taught by western-capitalist-influenced institutions.\n \n And yet...\n ?Postmodern thinkers have also drawn attention to the fact that what poses as objectivity is often pervaded with bias, and that science can never escape this, no matter how strictly it defines its epistemology\" **\n http://www.directionjournal.com/ale...s/belief01.html\n \n \n \n You wager this against Church authority which has proclaimed a single unchanging truth (as taught by Jesus Himself) throughout 2,000 years; an authority which you don't want to understand. I feel sorry for you. I truly do (I am not trying to be condascending, though it may sound like I am). At stake is your very existence!\n \n \n *And you've ignored the plethora of differing forms of evolutionary theory including 'Special Creation', 'Devolution' and 'Panspermia'; and from my readings it's already a fact that some are pushing for 'meta-evolution'.\n \n \n **\"Feminist critiques of science have recast many evolutionary arguments, particularly those concerned with sex and gender, as patriarchal rather than politically neutral. \n Numerous feminist social scientists and cultural theorists have argued that much of what evolutionary theorists claim as natural is instead culturally specific and political whilst feminist evolutionary theorists have provided alternative evolutionary explanations of numerous gendered traits and behaviours, which challenge rather than support existing gender ideologies. In so doing feminists have not only highlighted the patriarchal perspectives implicit in more traditional evolutionary theorising but have also illustrated the potential multiplicity of interpretations of 'the natural' (as well as of 'the cultural') and the inevitably political nature of any interpretation whether patriarchal or feminist; colonialist or liberal. Thus, whilst evolutionary theory is most frequently underpinned by an empiricist epistemology, many feminist theorists and others have asserted the political and cultural locatedness of any knowledge thus suggesting that debates around evolutionary theory should address not only how we conceptualise 'the natural' but also how we understand our knowledges and truth claims about 'the natural'. The purpose of this Special Issue is therefore to bring together papers, which address these ontological and epistemological issues about the nature of 'the natural' and the nature of our knowledges of 'the natural'.\"\n \n http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/rpeg-cfp1.html\n \n \n \n Whole species have been shifted about the 'tree' and yet, at every point, the theory is deemed 'true' as backed by the evidences.\n \n \n \n I shall conclude with some words of wisdom from one of my favourite writers...\n \n \"It is not perhaps without good reason that we attribute to simple-mindedness a readiness to believe anything and to ignorance the readiness to be convinced, for I think I was once taught hat a belief is like an impression stamped on our soul: the softer and less resisting the soul, the easier it is to print anything on it...On the other hand there is a silly arrogance in continuing to disdain something and to condemn it as false just because it seems unlikely to us. That is a common vice among those who think their capacities are above the ordinary\". \n \"That it is madness to judge the true and the false from our own capacities\", Michel de Montaigne (1993), \"The Essays: A Selection\", Penguin Classics, p74.",

   "I haven't really been following this debate lately, but I found this comment interesting. And it is right on the mark.\n \n Consider, Montalban, that everything you believe is simply that which you believe. Your believing it does not make it true. It may or may not be true. Your beliefs may or may not coincide with the truth. But the truth itself is independent of your beliefs. And the crazy thing is... no mere mortal will ever KNOW whether or not your beliefs are true. (Unless it is possible for individuals to transcend the physical realm. But that's another topic.)\n\n \n You are right in one thing, the truth is the truth, whether you or I believe it to be so.\n \n But, above all of us is God, and God taught His truth through His only Son, Jesus Christ. Christ was with us in a physical sense, for 3 years. He taught His chosen followers, and these continued to teach after He had gone.\n \n Thus the teaching was handed down.\n \n We call this Apostolic Succession.\n \n My own bishop is able thus, to trace his authority back to St. Peter, who founded our church in Antioch.\n \n Through God's grace, perhaps you will one day begin to understand this. emoticon_love",

   "Hello, Montalban.\n \n Don't take this the wrong way - I realize that you are sincere in your beliefs, and you have brought up some interesting points to think about and discuss, but I am afraid that we are appoaching the point where we are just going to be repeating ourselves. At that point it may be better to just agree to disagree and move on to other things.\n \n \nIt has been established - you simply try to cast seeds of doubt, when laughably you won't even investigate the subject in regards to the Church.\n\n Actually, it hasn't. The evidence for evolution exists. The Church claims evolution is false. Until this matter of evidence is cleared up, the Church appears quite untrustworthy to me.\n \n \n \nSo, are you saying that evolution might possibly be a mistake?\n\n Theoretically, yes. It could happen that both new evidence falsifying evolution will come to light and a completely different theory will be put forward that will explain both that evidence and the current evidence that we have now, then we might be able to conclude that evolution was a mistaken hypothesis.\n \n \n \nYou suggest that a trustworthy sources such as the Orthodox Church has made mistakes. Name one of dogma that it has made.\n\n I'm not talking about dogma. I'm talking about objective facts and logical inferences based on those facts. If creationism is a dogma, there is a mistake right there. If you are talking about religious dogma, strictly concerning itself with God, then there is no way to prove it wrong.\n \n \n \nNo, the source of authority is God.\n\n I simply cannot take your word for this, nor the word of the Church authorities.\n \n \n \nIt doesn't seek to refute gravitation. Why would it?\n\n I don't know why it would. I also don't know why it tries to refute evolution. I don't know why the First Church of Christ, Scientists try to refute medical science.\n \n \n \nFor you they are 'understandable' yet you argue against truth as taught unwavering by the Church.\n\n I will argue against any truth that is contrary to plain observational evidence, like the fossil record, molecular biology, cosmology, and the like.\n \n I will also argue against any subjective \"truth\" championed as superior to all other subjective \"truths\". Unless you can really present empirical reasons why I should trust that the Orthodox Church has a special hot-line to God.\n \n \n \nIt suggests 'evolution', 'panspermia', 'special creation', 'creation', 'meta-evolution', 'devolution', etc.\n\n Actually, it doesn't.\n \n \n \nSecond, earlier you said that even the greatest authority can make mistakes, now you're saying that in this case, science hasn't made a mistake - perhaps even to suggest that there's no possibility that it has.\n\n You seem to be commenting on my quote: \"On the other hand, the available evidence is quite unequivocal about, not only the evolution of life in a broad sense, but does answer these very questions about many lineages.\" I fail to see how you get the interpretation that you do out of my words.\n \n \n \n \nNazi science showed that eugenics was real.\n\n I believe that eugenics was a real movement. Actually, it was several different movements. History shows these movements really existed.\n \n \n \nI gave an example from feminist studies that showed that women can't orgasm, when having a sexual encounter with a man - and that even if the woman reports she has, they claim she's deceiving herself.\n\n Were these scientific studies? Were they published in relevant peer reviewed scientific journals? Were the findings ever collaborated by other scientists?\n \n You keep forgetting, science is a collective activity. Science is not simply some joker doing an experiment and announcing their results. Science involves setting up methodologies and standards to ensure that the results can be taken seriously and a way of allowing the entire scientific community, or at least the scientists of that field, of evaluating the research. That means publishing so that scientists can critique the methodologies (including the means of interpreting the data), and having the results verified by other scientists.\n \n \n \n \nThat's not what I'm saying. I'm saying you 'question Church authority' and at the same time refuse to discuss any attempts of me establishing this.\n\n I am not interested in listening to what selected \"authorities\" have to say, nor am I interested in what your feelings say. Well, that may sound cruel. What I mean is that, however interesting your feelings are, and how ever interesting the theological philosophies of the Church fathers are, they are very subjective. If you allow \"truth\" to be subjective and to differ among different people, then I will allow that the Church has a \"truth\". But if you insist that there is one truth, then I would like objective, empirical evidence for this.\n \n \n \nAlways questioning authority seems rather arrogant.\n\n History shows some of the catastrophes that can result from failing to question the leaders.\n \n \n \nIf you tell me that your nation's capital is Washington DC what good would it do to constantly question this?\n\n However, if that information would really have a large effect on your life, I would advise you to check it out.\n \n \n \nIt would in fact show me to be rather stupid, and even for argument's sake, our Church says that Mary, the Theotokos, lived with Jesus through most of Jesus' ministry - what set of questions should I ask to call this into light? How would I be able to test this? You see, you are applying a scientific mindset to faith.\n\n I agree that faith should be kept separate from scientific matters.\n \n \n \nWhat questions do you put to evolutionists? Which parts of evolutionary theory do you think are the most questionable?\n\n Whether mechanisms other than natural selection are important is one. Whether in some lineages at some times, trends may be the result of neutral drift rather than adaptation is another (but related). Whether selection can best be described as acting on individuals, or whether group selection can sometimes be important is another question I believe is being investigated.\n \n \n \n \nIf the evidence pointed to one thing, for so long, why did it suggest another? (You have here an example of your 'evidence' not changing so you should be happy).\n\n Ah. I misunderstood you. I would reply that the evidence that existed before this one experiment (or set of experiments) still exists unchanging, and this was new evidence. So I see now what you mean. When you say \"evidence is changing\", I would say, \"new evidence comes to light\". So this is confusion due to language.\n \n \n \nIt does, because you can't decide whether evolutionary theory is tenuous or immutable.\n\n It is not immutable because it is changing as new evidence comes to light. It is not tenuous since, even though it can, hypothetically, be falsified and replaced, it has passed all the scientific tests that have been put for it in the last 150 years, so I think that it is unlikely that it will disappear.\n \n \n \nQuestion: I thought evolution was just a theory. Why do you call it a fact?\n\n It is both. It is a theory in the sense that it is a model that explains the data that exists and predicts data we should find.\n \n It is a fact in the sense that it has been so well confirmed that it is very difficult for me to imagine that it could be wrong.\n \n \n \n \nYou say you 'trust', and you don't have faith. I think you are playing word games here!\n\n I trust that the answers given by science are reasonable and accurately reflect reality, at least to the best of our current abilities. I don't have \"faith\" in science because I know in the end these answers could be wrong.\n \n It was not my intention to play word games here. These are ordinary words in English, and so they have a range of meanings, and so I may end up using the words with slightly different meanings depending on context. If I were writing a formal essay, I would be very careful to avoid committing the fallacy of equivocation; however, in an informal conversation this sort of mistake is probably unavoidable. Be patient. If I don't quite understand what you are saying I will ask you about it. (Actually, there was a statement you made above that I didn't quite understand - I replied to a deliberate misinterpretation of it above - see if you can find it! - but as a joke, not as a deliberate attempt at obfuscation.) If you don't quite understand what I am saying or think I am committing the fallacy of equivocation, then bring it to my attention, like you just did.",

   "Science does not include anything which leaves no evidence that might be tested. Hypotheses which can be asserted but never supported are not part of science. However, these untestable phenomena are only removed from scientific consideration; they are not ruled out from life entirely. People are free to accept or reject them as they please, and science has absolutely nothing to say on the subject. Science not only rules out the acceptance of divine influence, it also rules out the rejection of divine influence.\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA601.html\n \n One would think that this leaves the possibility open that creation did happen. And yet...\n \n Science must also avoid non-natural explanations. This is explanatory naturalism. Any explanation that uses a non-natural explanans (thing doing the explaining) fails to be testable. I could propose that some process is the result of an Invisible Pink Unicorn's powers. You can neither falsify nor verify this (in the ordinary senses). The hallmark of science, perhaps the only hallmark, is that explanations are testable. The reason for this lies in what philosophy calls epistemology (from the Greek word for belief, epistem\u00e9, but used in the sense of knowledge - hence, 'the study of knowing').\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/naturalism.html\n \n Anyway...\n \n \nAs I said, the dogma that evolution is false is a mistake. This is based on empirical fact.\n\n \n Please quote which canon of the first Seven Ecumenical Councils which is in error, or another of the Church council's you might be aware of, or catechism that this assertion is based on - for you to say it is a mistake of 'dogma'. As I said, you criticise the Orthodox Church and know nothing about it, and it's relationships to authority etc.*\n \n Again, with evolution, you recognise that there's the possibility that it might be false. Therefore, how is this 'empirical fact'? I know you want 'fact' to mean all things for all people when dealing with evolution, but really!\n Have a look at\n http://www.carm.org/dialogues/evolutionisfact.htm\n \n \nAnother mistake is to set themselves up as the only \"truth\". But it is the nature of this sort of statement, I cannot prove this any more than the Church can prove its assertian (sic).\n\n \n Are you suggesting other religions are mistake free - and therefore the Orthodox Church shouldn't claim to be the sole sore of errorlessness (a word I've had to make up to try to encapsulate what you're saying).\n \n \nAgain, I will remind you that science is not just a bunch of individuals doing whatever they think is an experiment and then claiming they have scientific results. Science involves an entire profession. To claim to be scientific, one must use methods and procedures that are considered reliable, the experiment must be published so that others can critique the methods and interpretations, and the results must be verifiable by others independent of the original researcher.\n\n \n Further errors may present themselves with the advent of 'big science'; \" the organization of large numbers of scientists bringing different bodies of expertise to a common research project.\"\n \n http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/s...owledge-social/\n \n \n \n Hardwig in 1985 published research on the 'big science' project. He suggests that because a project becomes so large, no one scientist is an expert on all matters of the project; therefore there is a reliance upon the expertise of others in the project. \"This leads Hardwig to ask two questions, one about the evidential status of testimony, and one about the nature of the knowing subject in these cases. With respect to the latter, Hardwig says that either the group as a whole, but no single member, knows or it is possible to know vicariously. Neither of these is palatable to him. Talking about the group or the community knowing smacks of superorganisms and transcendent entities and Hardwig shrinks from that solution. Vicarious knowledge, knowing without oneself possessing the evidence for the truth of what one knows, requires, according to Hardwig, too much of a departure from our ordinary concepts of knowledge.\" \n Ibid\n \n Many people making mistakes does not make for a good example for you. A knowledge of these concepts is essential before blind faith is placed in evolutionary theory. One needs to know the men* behind the theory and an understanding as to what drives them. Many scientists themselves are unaware of their own a priori biases when dealing with evidences, because science itself is supposed to be about objectivity, and proofs, not on faith. The inquiry of scientists is said to be 'value-laden' that is, full of the values that the scientists bring with them to any experiment. Much of evolutionary theory is couched in the values of materialism.\n \n \"Most scientists are not philosophically inclined and will make use of whatever is a help in their work,\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/falsify.html\n \n Yet, evolution is based on the philosophy of materialism!\n \n This shows that evolution is based on materialism...\n \n Carl Sagan described the theory of evolution in his final book as the doctrine that \"human beings (and all the other species) have slowly evolved by natural processes from a succession of more ancient beings with no divine intervention needed along the way.\" It is the alleged absence of divine intervention throughout the history of life?the strict materialism of the orthodox theory?that explains why a great many people, only some of whom are biblical fundamentalists, think that Darwinian evolution (beyond the micro level) is basically materialistic philosophy disguised as scientific fact? \n \n http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9711/johnson.html\n \n \n \n This shows that materialism is a philosophy...\n Materialism is a philosophy. The theory that physical matter is the only reality and that everything, including thought, feeling, mind, and will, can be explained in terms of matter and physical phenomena.\n The theory or attitude that physical well-being and worldly possessions constitute the greatest good and highest value in life.\n \n A great or excessive regard for worldly concerns\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=materialism\n \n \n In conclusion, many hands does not make for an error free theory. Scientists rely on their colleagues - often without knowing exactly what it is they are doing. All the while they claim to be without philosophical influence, yet the very nature of their work is couched in the philosophy of materialism. Further, they say science is a fact - and has been shown - in that evolution, they believe has been evidenced, even in the laboratory - yet they can't agree how man evolved. Nor when, nor where. They just say 'it did' - so much for being able to extrapolate based on so called observations today. Even without observations, there is widespread belief in 'abiogenesis' simply because evolution is based on (a form of) science, which can't deal outside a limited set of parameters - it can't even countenance a theistic possibility - even if that were the truth.\n \n Even with 'empirical evidences' it can come up with mutually exclusive theories. (I have exampled these with the competing theories regarding the rise of man).\n \n It's adherents say that there are no absolute truths, and that evolution is science because it is falsifiable, yet they argue that it did happen - that it is a truth, absolutely!\n \n And, although science denies any knowledge of God, it vehemently tries to say it's not atheistic\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA601_1.html defends theistic evolution!\n \"Evolution does not in any way rule out the possibility of any outside influence, even divine influence. When evidence for outside influence has been observed, it has been included.\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA601.html\n It doesn't 'rule out'? It can't include either or it's not science.\n \n In short, evolution is all things to all men... truth and not truth; fact and yet theory; materialistic (that is 'without the supernatural'), yet not ruling out the supernatural; based on empirical evidences, yet these provide for mutually exclusive conclusions; not based on any philosophy, but tied up with 'materialism'.\n \n \n \n \n \n *Hint:\n \"Orthodoxy has neither a textual nor a doctrinal basis to reject evolutionism\"\n http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/evolution_kuraev.htm\n \n I'm surprised, because I was sure you raised this some months ago - or it might have been Theomorphic.\n \n For instance, on the issue of the flood, we believe it to have happened, but we don't need to produce 'empirical evidence' (your terms) to back it up, as it is miraculous and need not have left any 'empirical evidence' (I'm starting to like this phrase) to prove it.",

Most of these practices fall into two categories: misrepresentation and bias.\"\n http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/92prom.html\n \n \nI don't understand what montalban is getting at here.

Thanks for the input. Specifically your gripe is that 'numerous' others have already resolved this... No one has actively engaged the topic - Close Slave Can argued for a while that Nazi science wasn't sconce, then hey presto - the twin studies were the perfect example of science - a triumph of science over something or other.\n \n Another poster when debating the Peluxey 'footprints' likewise suggested that although the supporting article might have faults, it's been proven so many places it must be right (see my quote in the post above about 'big science')\n \n In a general critique of your post...If you actually care to critique the feminist sources I've posted, the please do, but that might be too much trouble. You simply display the lack of critical thinking that many on your side have - they just accept that science has solved these puzzles, somewhere - and that however/where ever it was done, there were no nasty little things such as ethics, philosophy, bias etc, involved.\n \n No, you have the sad and limited idea that your form of science is science.\n \n I am not the only one making this claim as I have evidenced sources on Marxist science and feminist science critiques of your science - to show that it is culturally biased and sexist.\n \n It is sad that you don't recognise the evidences when placed before you because of your continuing faith and belief in your own absolute and normative assertions.\n \n There were quotes about gender bias, both with the differing numbers of male/female scientists, and even in the ideas science puts forth. There are studies to show that the way science itself is taught, is biased...\n \"The issue of bias within science books, specifically in the topic of origin theories, is well documented. A paradigm?s adherents often exaggerate its strengths and ignore its weaknesses and critiques. Jonathan Wells (2000) in his pivotal book Icons of Evolution elucidates that the ten major ?icons? of evidence for evolution are exaggerated, misleading and even false, and ignore all the contradictory evidence. Both Anderson (1995) and Wells (2000) rate most state-adopted science texts as D or F because of the texts? bias. The texts? unscientific bias is seen in the admission of incomplete evidence, withholding of anomalies, fraudulent data, presenting falsified ideas, speculation and opinion mistakenly called ?theory,? promoting ideologies and suppressing others, and worldview discrimination.\"\n http://www.rae.org/bias.html\n Therefore what is taught as science is not 'science' in your terms.\n See also\n \"Gender in Bias in Science and Science Education\"\n http://www.physik.uni-bremen.de/physics.education/schwedes/text/bellater.htm\n \n Even Ursus recognises the philosophical influences on science.\n \n Books you might care to browse on the subject before you make the laughable suggestion that I am alone in this, and it is not researched... (or you could actually look at the previous sources I have - and if you want, draw up some criticism of them rather than act so lazy and just say 'it's already been disproven - what are you going on about' type argument).\n But first, I'll just have to repeat myself, because you obviously missed this one...\n \"Feminist critiques of science have recast many evolutionary arguments, particularly those concerned with sex and gender, as patriarchal rather than politically neutral. \n \n Numerous feminist social scientists and cultural theorists have argued that much of what evolutionary theorists claim as natural is instead culturally specific and political whilst feminist evolutionary theorists have provided alternative evolutionary explanations of numerous gendered traits and behaviours, which challenge rather than support existing gender ideologies. In so doing feminists have not only highlighted the patriarchal perspectives implicit in more traditional evolutionary theorising but have also illustrated the potential multiplicity of interpretations of 'the natural' (as well as of 'the cultural') and the inevitably political nature of any interpretation whether patriarchal or feminist; colonialist or liberal. Thus, whilst evolutionary theory is most frequently underpinned by an empiricist epistemology, many feminist theorists and others have asserted the political and cultural locatedness of any knowledge thus suggesting that debates around evolutionary theory should address not only how we conceptualise 'the natural' but also how we understand our knowledges and truth claims about 'the natural'. The purpose of this Special Issue is therefore to bring together papers, which address these ontological and epistemological issues about the nature of 'the natural' and the nature of our knowledges of 'the natural'.\"\n \n http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/rpeg-cfp1.html\n \n \n Gergen, Kenneth J. 1988.

   "Science does not include anything which leaves no evidence that might be tested....\n One would think that this leaves the possibility open that creation did happen. And yet....\n Science must also avoid non-natural explanations.\n\n This is the nature of science as it is practiced. So far, by refusing to believe that sickness was simply caused God we have modern medicine. In stead of believing that lightning was a sign from God we can use electicity. Instead of believing that inconsistencies in Newton's mechanics was God messing with the details, we have discovered quantum mechanics, and so you are able to converse using our computers. This naturalistic approach has been rather fruitful, wouldn't you say?\n \n This isn't to say that this approach works for all questions. There are matters that simply aren't scientific. But in matters that are scientific, if you are going to do science, you have to assume that the processes involved are natural. If you don't like it, then don't become a scientist. There are plenty of other rewarding careers available to intelligent and talented people.\n \n \n \nPlease quote which canon of the first Seven Ecumenical Councils which is in error, or another of the Church council's you might be aware of, or catechism that this assertion is based on - for you to say it is a mistake of 'dogma'.\n\n Sorry. I just took your word for it that the Orthdox Church teaches that evolution is false. If the Orthodox Church is actually sensible, then I apologize.\n \n \n \nAgain, with evolution, you recognise that there's the possibility that it might be false. Therefore, how is this 'empirical fact'?\n\n In the same way that William of Orange conquerored England in 1066 is an empirical fact, even though there is a remote, far fetched possibility that all the records of this event are forgeries by later rulers to justify their claims to the throne.\n \n It is possible that we again are using words with different meanings. What do you think an empirical fact is? Perhaps I should use a different word.\n \n \n \nAre you suggesting other religions are mistake free....\n\n No.\n \n \n \n \nHardwig in 1985 published research on the 'big science' project.\n\n I share some of these concerns. However, big projects are not just a bunch of small pieces cobbled together. Each small piece is understood by an expert, and the expert's knowledge is broad enough that she understands the other pieces that directly connect to her piece well enough to determine whether the pieces are joined seamlessly. And there are individuals who know the whole project well-enough that they can spot most of the errors, and know enough to have diagnostics in place to indicate problems. And the projects are published so that anyone else, with different ranges of expertise, can spot problems. It's not perfect, but so far the results from \"big science\" are consistent.\n \n At any rate this is irrelevant to evolution. The vast majority of the data is \"small science\".\n \n \n \n \nNeither of these is palatable to him.\n\n Sounds like a philosophical problem.\n \n \n \nMuch of evolutionary theory is couched in the values of materialism.\n\n This is false.\n \n \n \nYet, evolution is based on the philosophy of materialism!\n\n This is false.\n \n \n \nIt is the alleged absence of divine intervention throughout the history of life?the strict materialism of the orthodox theory?that explains why a great many people, only some of whom are biblical fundamentalists, think that Darwinian evolution (beyond the micro level) is basically materialistic philosophy disguised as scientific fact?\n\n As is any other scientific theory. The theory of gravity, or the quantum theory, or the theory of relativity - these are also theories that allege an absence of divine intervention in the areas in which they are applicable. I guess all of science is basically materialistic philosophy disguised as scientific fact? Does the Orthodox Church say that the theory of relativity and quantum theory remove the necessity of a creator active in her creation, and so we must refuse to accept these theories, instead believing that the creator is directly responsible for all phenomena by direct intervention?\n \n \n \nThis shows that materialism is a philosophy.... Materialism is a philosophy.\n\n It can be part of a philosophy (it is certainly part of mine), but I will remind you that there are plenty of Christians who do not have a materialist philosophy, but accept science, and especially the theory of evolution, as a part of the way God works.\n \n \n \n \nFurther, they say science is a fact - and has been shown - in that evolution, they believe has been evidenced, even in the laboratory - yet they can't agree how man evolved. Nor when, nor where.\n\n I don't know when my ancestors arrived to North America from Europe, or when, and I only know a tiny part of how the last generation made it to the West Coast. Yet, there is no doubt that my ancestors came from Europe.\n \n \n \nEven with 'empirical evidences' it can come up with mutually exclusive theories.\n\n Data can be good enough to give a broad overall picture, and still be insufficient to fill in details. Did I mention that there is good data that my ancestors came from Europe? But the data do not indicate how it happened.\n \n \n \nIt's adherents say that there are no absolute truths, and that evolution is science because it is falsifiable, yet they argue that it did happen - that it is a truth, absolutely!\n\n Now you're being silly.\n \n \n \nAnd, although science denies any knowledge of God, it vehemently tries to say it's not atheistic\n\n Science merely says that it cannot come to any knowledge of God. The individual must find knowledge of God through other means.\n \n \n \n \n \nIn short, evolution is all things to all men... truth and not truth; fact and yet theory; materialistic (that is 'without the supernatural'), yet not ruling out the supernatural; based on empirical evidences, yet these provide for mutually exclusive conclusions; not based on any philosophy, but tied up with 'materialism'.\n\n Now you're being silly again.\n \n \n \nFor instance, on the issue of the flood, we believe it to have happened, but we don't need to produce 'empirical evidence' (your terms) to back it up, as it is miraculous and need not have left any 'empirical evidence' (I'm starting to like this phrase) to prove it.\n\n Then it is not scientific. Science deals with empirical evidence. Sorry. That's the way it is. If you don't like it, don't become a scientist.",

The publication of Charles Darwin's works on evolution demonstrated the possibility that living organisms can be accounted for on a material basis without any need to refer to a biblical Creator or supernatural purposes.

God's original creation (Gen. 1:1) became broken, and we are now living in a reconstituted creation. The physical record in creation identifies lower forms evolving into higher forms. The amphibian dynasty preceded the reptilian dynasty. A 'day' to God is simply a very, very long time to men. Scientists say life came out of the water, and so does your Bible. (Gen. 1:20). Male and female came along later (Gen. 1:26-28). Those are sixth day people have been here evolving over millions of years (Leaky's Lucy) into the races we have today.\n \n Adam, however, is a different kind of man altogether from the sixth day races. He was formed by the Lord God on the seventh day (we are still living within the boundaries of that day) into the singularity expression that existed in Genesis 1:1. He was spirit (breath of life), body (dust of ground) and 'became a living soul.' Gen. 2:7. Eve and the Seed were taken out of this one man, who previously possessed every member of the Adamic race within him. So while mankind has been on this planet for millions of years, the descendants of Adam (the descendants of Shem, Japheth and Ham; Noah's sons after the flood) have been here for only the past 6000 years. Everyone else on this planet is descended from the sixth day races.\n \n The land of the garden is the 'land' where Noah's flood took place. The Hebrew expressions for 'earth' and 'land' are identical. Simply replace the mistranslated word earth with land, and the whole account makes better sense.

   "Greetings to Close and All:\n\n \n G'day to you too!\n \n \"Long ago (in the 4th century!) one of the Church's teachers Vasilius the Great wrote about this. He advised the Orthodox Christians neither to rely upon the scientific data in order to provide foundation for their faith in Christ, nor to try to disprove them, because \"the scientists permanently disprove themselves.\"\n \n http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/age-of-earth.htm\n \n \n \nThe answer to kill this thread is that the Creator utilized Evolution as a tool to reconstitute a broken universe into a form that could be reconciled back to Him through His Word. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral\n\n \n If only that was so easy! Which model of evolution did God use?\n \n Further, within the orthodox models of evolution are further different models.\n \n For instance when I was studying evolution in 1986 we had taught 4 mutually exclusive theories as to the ascent of man.\n \n I would have asked you then... 'Which model did God use?\"\n \n There were the...\n Unilinear School \n \n Polyphyletic School, \n \n Preneanderthal School\n \n Presapiens School\n \n each was an equally valid possibility because each followed the rules of evidence.\n \n Now some of those models have bitten the dust, and new mutually exclusive theories have emerged.\n \n So, I can still ask you \"Which model did God use?\"\n \n Even within models there are problems. Some aspects of evolution are inherently value-ridden, and this has been the case since The Theory of Evolution first stained the world. (note the value statement there!)\n \n \"Among the most significant scientific influences on the reification of a theory of sexual dimorphism in the nineteenth century was the work of Charles Darwin. His evolutionary theory held that the sexual categories male and female emerged to serve the fundamental purpose of species reproduction required for natural selection and survival. The binary sex categories and the characteristics that distinguished them were defined as natural across time and place, a phylogenetically inherited structure of two basic types of human groups. By the end of the nineteenth century, male and female came to be seen as \"innate structures in all forms of life ... [and] heterosexuality as the teleologically necessary and highest form of sexual evolution\" (Herdt, 1996, p. 28).\"\n \n http://www.findarticles.com/cf_0/m2...1/article.jhtml\n \n \n \n That is, some of the ideas of Darwin were couched in the dominant ideas of his time. Thus Darwin attempted to explain gender roles in evolutionary terms\n \n \"Darwin postulated that females are ''coy,'' mating rarely and choosing their mates carefully, presumably betting their odds on the males with the best genes to contribute to their offspring. For their part, males are ''ardent'' and promiscuous, and fight amongst themselves for female partners. Later theories added that males are promiscuous because they have less to lose by making babies - unlike eggs, sperm are plentiful and small. Plus, females usually do most of the work to raise the offspring\" http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_relea...u-sag021003.php\n \n \n \n Further, the name of this thread is...'Where does science say we come from?' You believe in God, but science doesn't. If somewhere along the line you feel/think God is involved, well science can't agree (it can't disagree either as it can't prove for God), but the main point is, your notion of God is not scientific. So you need to look at 'Where does science say we come from?' without reference to God.",

   "Hello, ungerdunn. I think what Montalban is guilty of is the fallacy of equivocation, but, if I may be so bold as to read another person's mind, I don't think it is intentional.\n \n Hello, Montalban. I think we are getting ourselves confused here. There are several meanings of materialism and of naturalism, and we are in danger of equivocating if we are not careful. I thought I had explained what I felt clearly, but I guess I haven't. Judging from another thread, I seem to be having some trouble getting myself understood.\n \n Here is what I meant. Science in general and the theory of evolution in particular are materialistic in that they only deal with the natural, material universe, and they assume that phenomena have natural causes. They assume that phenomena have natural causes because that is all that they can deal with. \n \n This is not to say that science and evolution automatically assume that the natural, material universe is all that there is; only that they are unable to deal with the supernatural. If the supernatural can be studied using the scientific method, then the supernatural can be a subject of science.\n \n So the theory of evolution assumes that the history of life on earth is subject to natural, materistic processes. Perhaps this is a false assumption, but if it is then science cannot begin to study life. So it must make this assumption in order to proceed.\n \n However, once scientists have made this assumption, and begin to apply the hypothesis of commen descent through natural selection, a very self-consistent picture has emerged. Now, it is hard to just come up with some ad hoc theory and have it fit so well with observational data. This would seem to make the assumption that the history of life is subject to material, natural processes is a good assumption.\n \n However, as I said, and as ungerdunn has said, science makes no claim as to whether the supernatural exists. It merely states that the supernatural is beyond its scope; it assumes that any phenomenon has a natural cause only because that is the only way it can study the phenomenon.\n \n I, however, do claim that the material universe is all that there is. But that is a belief on my part. I don not claim that there is any evidence for it (unless I am allowed to claim the absence of evidence as evidence of absence); nor do I have a strictly logical proof of that; nor do I claim that my beliefs are scientific in any way.\n \n Ungerdunn may disagree with how I am using some of these words, but I suspect that we are in broad agreement of the principle ideas of what I am saying. I am hoping to avoid an argument of semantics, Montalban. So I am going to have to pin you down on a very precise defintion of \"materialism\" or \"naturalism\".",

It's like saying science has a choice, but we know they will never choose one option. Therefore materialism is by default a part of science.\n \n Individual scientists might have their own ideas, but that is completely besides the point as far as science is concerned (well it should be - if you are arguing that science is about objective truths and scientific evidence).\n \n The problem is that science is not divorced from scientists, so when people have their own value judgments on top of their scientific understandings, then they will say that science 'won't rule out God'\n \n As I believe it can never 'rule Him in' ever, it's rather hollow to say it won't rule Him out.\n \n I think we had a debate some time ago whether sciences is atheistic or agnostic.\n \n My understanding of materialism and naturalism are that they hold that all that is, is in nature (naturalism), that is, there is nothing super-natural, and therefore all causes in nature are material, (that is, caused by something tangible or rather, not by something super-natural).\n \n This is why it is easy to be an atheist and a scientist, becuase the science encapsulates everything that the atheist is prepared to accept.

   "The story of science under German fascism is not, as conventional wisdom would have it, only a narrative of suppression and survival; a truthful account will explain how and why Nazi ideology promoted certain areas of inquiry, and how projects and policies were championed or disappeared because of political considerations.\n http://www.adl.org/Braun/dim_14_1_nazi_med.asp\n \n \nmontalban your point would only be valid if you could scientifically prove that the Nazis did not commit atrocities. \n\n \n I've no idea what you mean by this. Are you saying that they didn't?\n \n Doctor Leonard Hoenig, Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of South Florida College of Medicine, categorized the Nazi experiments as ...inspired and administered through racial ideologies of genocide. Doctor Hoenig maintained that nothing scientific could have resulted from sadism.\n http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/NaziMedEx.html\n For them, they don't believe for these reasons it can be said to be science.\n \n Some agree that the data is still useful\n While some researchers deem Nazi hypothermia and phosgene data defective, others find parts helpful and believe their research benefits from it. Further, other Nazi data--the sea water studies in particular--may be of decent scientific quality (Franzblau & Thaler, 1984b). Though such data may be valuable, is its use ethical?\n http://www.stanford.edu/group/STS/techne4.shtml\n \n \nHow could you come to that interpretation? I was saying they could follow science but their ideology did not come from science. Post 56 states the same thing their is no contradiction if you don't deliberately twist my words. \n\n \n No, you said that the experiments that they conducted was not science. You said, 'Nazis called it science'. That is, just because they called it science, it's not necessarily science. Then you challenge me which is itself an admission of this; that it can't be called science unless I show you the actual experimentation performed.\n And then you criticise the fact I will not publish an actual example. I do not want to give them any more 'credit'. But for you, this proves that I can't show that it was 'science', through the fact I've not been able to prove it was science, by the criteria you set.\n \n I said that I did not need to show an actual experiment anyway, because it is understood that the science was 'good' in that it followed rules for science, and could actually be applied (should our views on the ethics of it change). To which you acknowledge this when you then you congratulate them on finding some kind of cancer link.\n \n They attempted to gain knowledge through science. If it weren't for their ideology, they'd have not experimented on humans.\n \n \"To determine how long German pilots forced to bail out over water could survive and to establish effective rewarming techniques, researchers conducted the notorious Dachau hypothermia studies (Berger, 1990). These entailed immersion of subjects in vats of ice water, often until they froze to death (Proctor, 1988). In other studies, researchers subjected prisoners to mutilating limb and bone transplants to improve techniques for use in actual medical emergencies; investigators also injected prisoners with infectious bacteria to determine the potency of new antibacterial drugs. One experimenter shot prisoners through the neck and chest or amputated their extremities to evaluate the performance of a blood clotting agent (Berger, 1990). Combined, these and other experiments killed or injured as many as 10,000 concentration camp prisoners (Thomas, 1990).\"\n http://www.stanford.edu/group/STS/techne4.shtml\n \n Look to the \"RACIALLY MOTIVATED EXPERIMENTS\" listed at\n http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/NaziMedEx.html\n \n Then you call me rude.\n \n \nThey performed experiments to gain knowledge to give them power. The knowledge itself is just knowledge.\n\n \n No, no it is not. The twins experiments is not 'just knowledge'. I find it reprehensible that anyone should claim it so. You might want to support human experimentation in order to benefit science, but I find it a repulsive notion.\n \n \nA Nazi world view was Jews should be exterminated. How does science support this world view? Give me the hypothesis and experiment that supports this world view, not the irrelevant material you have already given me and you have a valid point. Don't you are just using a facetious guilt by association argument.\n\n \n See racially motivated experiments above, or\n \"Early in power the National Science groups were pushed into research of the race and experiments commenced. First the party needed propaganda to prove all other races were inferior. Measurements of heads, eyes, nose, blood were required. The vast majority of the early experiments were a propaganda sham. It was determined Gypsies had different blood and were inclined to criminal behavior. The same type of findings were made of all races other than the Nazis.\"\n http://www.remember.org/educate/medexp.html\n \n In conclusion:\n \n Ultimately, the arguments as to whether the experiments were scientific or not, or whether the doctors were medically competent or not, leaves one with the impression that had such experiments been \"good\" science and the doctors medical professionals, these facts would somehow change our impression of the doctors and their experiments. This is not true. The sadistic evil of the Nazi butchery is in no way lessened by its scientific value.

   "The heart of Darwinism is survival of the fittest.\n \"Further on in his Descent, Darwin elaborates on this theme describing his dream of a future for mankind when the black races of man, as well as the mountain gorilla of Africa, will hopefully become extinct, thus enhancing the chances for the evolutionary advancement of the more \"civilized\" races of man: \"At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilized state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the negro or Australian and the gorilla.\" (Descent of Man, Chapter Six: On the Affinities and Genealogy of Man, On the Birthplace and Antiquity of Man)\"\n http://www.thedarwinpapers.com/oldsite/number12/Darwinpapers12HTML.htm\n or\n http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/charles_darwin/descent_of_man.html\n \n ?The result of all racial crossing is therefore in brief always the following: \n Lowering of the level of the higher race;\n Physical and intellectual regression and hence the beginning of a slowly but surely progressing sickness.?\n Adolf Hitler, ?Mein Kampf: Volume One - A Reckoning Chapter XI: Nation and Race?\n http://www.hitler.org/writings/Mein_Kampf/mkv1ch11.html\n \n ?A central theme of Hitler?s thinking was the concept of struggle. In the nineteenth century the naturalist Charles Darwin had explained how in the world of nature when the environment changed some of the species with favourable variations survived better that others. Darwin called this ?natural selection?. \n Social Darwinism was a concept that emerged later in the nineteenth century suggesting that what applied to nature could also apply to human society ? that the strong prevail over the weak, that superior races prevail over inferior races. This concept with its theme of struggle and survival of the fittest appealed to Hitler. ?Struggle? wrote Hitler ?is the father of all things?He who wants to live must fight and who does not want to fight in this world where external struggle is the law of life has no right to exist?.\n http://www.planetpapers.com/Assets/3197.php\n \n Nazi governmental policy was openly influenced by Darwinism, the Zeitgeist of both science and educated society of the time\n Stein, G., Biological science and the roots of Nazism, American Scientist 76(1):50?58, 1988. quoted at http://www.trueorigin.org/holocaust.asp\n \n This conclusion has justified a wide variety of governmental and scientific policies, not the least infamous were racial genocide programs.\n Gould, Stephen Jay, 1981. The Mismeasure of Man, W. W. Norton Co., New York.\n Schleuncs, Karl A., 1970. The Twisted Road to Auschwitz, University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Illinois, pp. 147-149.\n quoted at\n http://www.biblebelievers.net/CreationScience/kjcevol1.htm\n \n This is not to suggest that all Darwinists support(ed) genocide. Many advocates of Darwinism at the beginning of the 20th century only went so far as to propose that sterilisation of poor and undesirable classes be carried out (to prevent them breeding and polluting the gene pool). Other Darwinists, who might still hold onto Western concepts of morality would not support either genocide or eugenics (I would hope). However, quite clearly science and Nazism can easily be linked.\n \n This doesn?t imply science is evil. Science has no morals, but science doesn?t just ?exist? by itself. Once a person starts applying science or studying science, they bring with them their own values. And because of the inherent amorality of science, it can be meshed into a huge number of beliefs (see below; different types of science).\n \n \n@montalban you say\n \"but now you're saying that because I don't support their experimentation on humans that I'm against all science.\"\n\n \n To be exact you have clearly implied \n \"because I don't support their experimentation on humans that I consider any sort of science no better than any other world view\".\n \n This is true to the point that science is a tool for using by man in backing up his world-view. You just assume that 'science' as you know it 'is' science and that all others aren't.\n \n \nI asked you justify this statement and you did it by defining Nazi science in two different ways. The first definition of you use \"Nazi science\" is the experiments performed by the Nazis which I condemn. The second definition is that science is exactly the same as ideology so Nazi science is Nazi ideology. According to your definitions \"Nazi ideology= Nazi science\" and \"chemistry = science\" so translating the reasonable sentence.\n \"Nazi ideology is not the same as chemistry\" into \"montalbanspeak\" we get\n \"Nazi science is not science\". I used your own definitions and you called me a silly Nazi supporter. \n You are right about condemning Nazi atrocities but you have proven your previous statements involving the phrase Nazi science were nonsense because when I use phrase \"Nazi science\" using your definition \"Nazi science= Nazi ideology\" you say I do not make sense and you say I am being ridiculous. Thank you for proving your previous offhand comments about \"there are many types of science including Nazi science so evolution is exactly the same as being a Nazi because evolution is a science\" were invalid.\n\n \n No. I stated there are different versions of science. The science you know of rightly shouldn't just be called 'science', but Western Capitalist Science.\n \n \nMost of the links you have given me define a science that is not the same as torturing human beings so they also prove you wrong.\n\n \n Most of?\n \n But even here you are wrong in your re-rendition. Most of them are using their own western values to suggest that it can't be science if Nazis applied Nazi values to science, as you tried to do.\n \n In the western mind-set, they are appalled by the experiments done on humans, not because it isn't 'science', but because they are looking at it through western ethics that human experiments is bad. It is only 'bad science' because it's done on humans (which is actually judging the science by ethics, not by science). This is the argument you first attempted to do, judging their science, by your ethics. Then you changed you mind to judge their science as science, but make an ethical statement that it was a just pursuit of knowledge.\n \n I maintain that the Nazis did the experiments on humans precisely because they viewed their subjects as less than human. But a dialectic relationship was at work, because they also used science to back up their notions that the people weren't human. You have stated that is wasn't science, based on your notion that anything 'tainted' with Nazism isn't science (which is suppose to be value-free, according to you), but then you recognize that what they did was scientific... in relation to a specific example regarding smoking. But you fail to note that the reason that they did that experiment was to further their own racist notions.\n \n The ideology of Nazis was reflected by earlier notions of class and lead to the sciences of eugenics, and phrenology (which we are appalled by now, so we conveniently call them 'pseudo-science')\n \n In fact;\n there's Nazi Science\n Marxist Science\n Feminist Science\n Capitalist Science\n various Nationalist Sciences\n Finnish nationalist science! (see http://www.hf-fak.uib.no/smi/paj/isotalo.html)\n Indian (see http://www.ljudmila.org/nettime/zkp4/08.htm)\n Chinese\n various attempts at religious-Sciences\n Pythaogrean Science\n Christian (Creationist) Science\n Islamic Science\n (some of these are pseudo sciences, depending upon your a priori understandings of normative science)\n \n Each one of these will use science to further their own ends, and they will each 'succeed' because they can all find the evidences to back them up.\n The Chinese are quick to show the prominent role China played in our evolution. There is evidence that we evolved in Africa, or that we evolved elsewhere. http://www.chineseprehistory.org/beard.htm suggests that man arose in China, not Africa!* (or rather an ancestor of man arose there)\n http://www.chineseprehistory.org//index.htm is the introduction to this site. It is evidence of the nature of evidence, wholly subjective; that Chinese nationalism is behind these particular pieces of 'scientific evidence.' This increases the over-all number of different forms of science there are.\n \n \"In Marxism, groups are more important than individuals. Capitalists view nature as competitive, whereas these Marxist critics tend to view it as being much more cooperative.\"\n http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/hull_sociobiology.html\n \n I also mentioned earlier Darwin's ideas of 'coy' females and he had the science to back that up. This is in a similar vein; the dialectic relationship between science and world-view. He was raised in the era of women at home. People, not just him have provided scientific studies to back this world-view up. But as our world-view changes, we find the science that suggests more equality. I have given you a number of feminist critiques which still determine science is value-riddled. You said his findings were 'okay'.\n \"In all of these cases, gender bias is represented as a cause of error, or at least delay in recognizing the truth.\"\n http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/f...m-epistemology/\n \n In the early 1970s a group of radical feminists went so far as to suggest that it was physically impossible for a woman to achieve sexual orgasm whilst having penetrative sex. They had empirical data; so much so that they insisted that even if the woman experienced an orgasm, she was said to be deceiving her self.... \"That even in a woman's sexuality, there is deceit on the part of men, and complacency on the part of some women\" in Koedt, A. \"The Myth of Vaginal Orgasm.\" \n in Koedt, A. & Levine, E. & Rapone, A., (eds.). (1973). \"Radical Feminism\". Quadrangle Books, New York, p204\n \n Then you call me rude for pointing out you change your opinion on whether it's science or not.\n \n Then you give a truly dishonest rendering of what I say by stating I believe all science to be evil.\n \n Not to mention that you give some truly odd notions about their science experiments being okay, if they followed rules of science. You said this too! That is was a just pursuit of knowledge.",

   "Close_slave_can,\n \n I think you are correct. Monty keeps returning to the same rut, post after post, after post. He has been shown to be incorrect several times in this thread alone. And yet, he continues to spout the same rhetoric, claiming that he is correct and supporting his assertions with debunked arguments.\n \n So I guess the answer is that you should take off your shoes, or something.\n \n Monty starts his last post with a falicy. He says, \"The heart of Darwinism is survival of the fittest.\" Monty is dead wrong. Darwin objected to the phrase applied to his theories from the first day he heard it. It became popular and Darwin was finally persuated to use it by Wallace, the co-discoverer of the theory of natural selection. Darwin used it in the 4th edition of \"Origins,\" ALWAYS either preceded or followed by a reference to natural selection. \"Survival of the fittest\" is a tautology. Fitness is determined by survival and those that survive are the fittest. That is not Darwinism - not even on the surface.\n \n Darwin expressed 5 independant theories in \"Origins\":\n \n 1) Evolution: This is the idea that lineages change over time. Darwin's grandfather and Lamarck were two of several scientists that preceded Darwin that recognized this idea. Darwin proposed that these changes were more significant that had been previously proposed. Even creationists accept this idea. But when presented with the overwhelming number of species that populate the earth, creationists propose \"variation in kind\". The problem is that creationist variation necessarily procedes at rates that are orders of magnitude greater than any proposed by an evolutionary biologist.\n \n 2) Gradualism: Darwin proposed that differences between populations of organisms accumulate by a series of innumerable small steps through intermedicate forms. Creationists prefer to claim a small number of \"kinds\" followed by huge differences accumulated in only a few years.\n \n 3) Population speciation: Evolution is a process, not of individual organisms, but of populations of organisms. Offspring are not different species from their parents. Even though Darwin knew nothing of genetics, he proposed that evolution is a process change that occurs in the heritable characteristics of a population over time.\n \n 4) Common descent: This is the major crux for creationists and causes them to distort Darwin's theories and reality. While creationists accept changes in populations over time, they cannot tolerate gradualism or common descent. Common descent is rejected because the mythology of ancient, nomadic herdsmen is posited as history. Gradualism is rejected because there is not enough time to develop the observed genetic diversity that is observed in living things into only a few years.\n \n 5) Natural selection: This is the most important theory proposed by Darwin. This is the principle of differential reproductive success. All organisms produce so many offspring that population size would increase exponentionally if not constrained, and yet, populations remain relatively constant. This is because there exists in any environment a limited number of resources. As a result, all organisms are engaged in a constant competition to acquire the limited resourses in order to survive. They also strive to evade predators. Thus, any characteristics of an organism that make it better able to acquire or use resourses, or to evade predators or paracites, give that organism a better chance to survive to reproduce. Darwin observed that in any population there exists great genetic variability such that no two individuals are exactly the same (with the exception of identical twins). According to Darwin, those organisms that are better able to acquire necessary resources are more likely to reach maturity and to reproduce, thus passing on those advantageous characteristics to their progeny. Organisms that are at a disadvantage will tend to produce fewer offspring. That is differential reproductive success and that is why populations change over time.\n \n All of the above have moved beyond the province of scientific testing. All of the above have been observed, and Darwin's theory predicted them exactly.\n \n The above was a simple statement of natural selection. While Monty claims to do it in one simple phrase, it took me a few words more.\n \n Moreover, Monty quotes a source that represents Darwin's opinions as \"his dream of a future.\" It was no such thing. Sadly, Darwin's postdiction of the extermination of \"savage\" races was well underway when he wrote those words. And of course, all of the great apes are in danger of extinction. It matters not that Darwin considered some populations of humans to be intermediate between apes and humans. What is important is that Christians believed it to be so, and Christians treated fellow humans as if they were animals.\n \n As to Hitler and Darwinism: Neither Darwin nor Darwinism advocated the extermination of the \"unfit.\" Only XXXXXX make such implications. If one were to educate himself as to the actual principles of Darwinian evolution, one would realize that Hitler was not a Darwinist. The phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was coined by Herbert Spencer a philosopher/sociologist/economist. \"Survival of the fittest\" was actually an economic theory. Spencer's economic theory was known as social Darwinism, and it was this theory that Hitler misapplied.\n \n It is ironic that Monty would make such a big deal of Hitler and Naziism. Hitler always declared that he was a Christian and was doing his Christian duty. He admired Martin Luther greatly. If there is such a thing as Nazi science, then there is also such a thing as Nazi Christianity.",

He correctly thought that the variation already existed and that nature just selected for the most suitable beak shape and against less useful ones. Darwin and his supporters ultimately described this process as the \"survival of the fittest.\" This is very different from Lamarck's incorrect idea that the environment altered the shape of individuals and that these acquired changes were then inherited.\"\n http://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_2.htm\n \n The best twist on this is...\n The phrase 'survival of the fittest' was not even Darwin's. It was urged on him by Wallace, the codiscoverer of natural selection, who hated 'natural selection' because he thought it implied that something was doing the selecting. Darwin coined the term 'natural selection' because had made an analogy with 'artificial selection' as done by breeders, an analogy Wallace hadn't made when he developed his version of the theory. The phrase 'survival of the fittest' was originally due to Herbert Spencer some years before the Origin\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/tautology.html\n That is, it doesn't argue that he didn't use it, just that he didn't 'coin' it.\n \n However, you are just plain wrong...\n Look at this chapter from Darwin's own book\n On the Origin Of Species (1859)\n Chapter IV: Natural Selection; Or  the Survival of the Fittest  \n http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/charles_darwin/origin_of_species/Chapter4.html\n From the same source\n This preservation of favourable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called Natural Selection, or the  Survival of the Fittest. \n \n NOTE well too, you even argue against yourself in your own words; you state\n a) Darwin always fought against it\n b) Darwin conceded to it, under pressure from Wallace\n What difference does it make if he uses it in conjunction with 'natural selection'? None. He uses it, becuase he was pursuaded to by Wallace BECAUSE it was a better way of describing his ideas (see quote above) That's why he says \"OR\" between the two, because they equate as being the same\n \n \nDarwin expressed 5 independent theories in \"Origins\":\n etc.\n All of the above have moved beyond the province of scientific testing. All of the above have been observed, and Darwin's theory predicted them exactly.\n The above was a simple statement of natural selection. While Monty claims to do it in one simple phrase, it took me a few words more.\n\n \n Good for you, but what has this got to do with Nazis using it? I suppose by supposition that's been 'dealt somewhere else', too.\n \n \nMoreover, Monty quotes a source that represents Darwin's opinions as \"his dream of a future.\" It was no such thing. Sadly, Darwin's postdiction (sic?) of the extermination of \"savage\" races was well underway when he wrote those words. And of course, all of the great apes are in danger of extinction. It matters not that Darwin considered some populations of humans to be intermediate between apes and humans. What is important is that Christians believed it to be so, and Christians treated fellow humans as if they were animals.\n\n \n Quite clearly Darwin sees that survival of the fittest will play out to an ends of 'inferior races' dwindling. I quoted his words.\n \n \nAs to Hitler and Darwinism: Neither Darwin nor Darwinism advocated the extermination of the \"unfit.\" Only XXXXXX make such implications. If one were to educate himself as to the actual principles of Darwinian evolution, one would realize that Hitler was not a Darwinist. The phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was coined by Herbert Spencer a philosopher/sociologist/economist. \"Survival of the fittest\" was actually an economic theory. Spencer's economic theory was known as social Darwinism, and it was this theory that Hitler misapplied.\n\n \n I never said that Darwin did advocate the extermination of the unfit.\n Post 109\n \nThis is not to suggest that all Darwinists support(ed) genocide. Many advocates of Darwinism at the beginning of the 20th century only went so far as to propose that sterilisation of poor and undesirable classes be carried out (to prevent them breeding and polluting the gene pool). Other Darwinists, who might still hold onto Western concepts of morality would not support either genocide or eugenics (I would hope). However, quite clearly science and Nazism can easily be linked.\n\n \n Hey, but let's just ignore what I say, and let's just presume I've said something else, and argue against that. The fact that several posters are arguing in the same style as you doesn't make you correct. I've notice in the last 3 pages of argument Close has just been giving opinion, and strawman. That I am still arguing against you on this might mean that I am going over the same stuff; for instance a long long time ago, another poster \"Hank\" also made the same mistake about \"survival of the fittest\", but I go back, and get the sources, never-the-less.\n \n \nIt is ironic that Monty would make such a big deal of Hitler and Nazism. Hitler always declared that he was a Christian and was doing his Christian duty. He admired Martin Luther greatly. If there is such a thing as Nazi science, then there is also such a thing as Nazi Christianity.\n\n \n Again making just-so statements. Well, I'll use your own 'evidence-lite' method of argument here. Ungerdunn! These issues have been dealt with a million times in the past, somewhere else!",

If called on it, I would gladly do a google search. If pressed, I actually would go to the science library here and look up the relevant literature. What disturbs me is that I am rarely pressed to do any of this.

   "Well, we can safely conclude that Monty hasn't read any of Darwin's works. That certainly explains his misunderstanding of Darwin and Darwinism.\n \nDo you think he's wrong when he stated that Darwin never used the term \"Survival of the Fittest?\"\n\n If I had said that, I would have been wrong. But the fact is that I didn't say that. You seem to have a problem in undertanding English. Let me help. Here is what I said:\n \nMonty starts his last post with a falicy. He says, \"The heart of Darwinism is survival of the fittest.\" Monty is dead wrong. Darwin objected to the phrase applied to his theories from the first day he heard it. It became popular and Darwin was finally persuaded to use it by Wallace, the co-discoverer of the theory of natural selection. Darwin used it in the 4th edition of \"Origins,\" ALWAYS either preceded or followed by a reference to natural selection.\n\n I also explained the following to Monty:\n \nThe phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was coined by Herbert Spencer a philosopher/sociologist/economist. \"Survival of the fittest\" was actually an economic theory. Spencer's economic theory was known as social Darwinism, and it was this theory that Hitler misapplied.\n\n And yet, Monty somehow seems to think that it is a weakness of evolutionary theory that Hitler misapplied social Darwinism but doesn't have a problem with Hitler doing his Christian duty.\n \n To Barbarian Monty says:\n \nWhy do you too resort to the ad hominem? (that is the intent; you completely ignore his statement which is incorrect. Let's ignore his opinion stated as fact which was wrong, and determine to try to character attack the guy who caught him out).\n\n There are a couple of problems here. Barbarian only asked a question. It seems that you don't know what an ad hominem is. No one has attacked you. We have questioned your assertions and asked that you have actually educated yourself on the topic that you are discussing.\n \n Also, since I didn't say what you claim I did, how can you claim I was wrong. You don't seem to understand what it is that I said. Go back and read it again. If you have some doubt that what I said is true, then read \"Life and Letters of Charles Darwin - Volume II\" You'll find some discussion of it in 1866, right after the publication of the 3rd edition of \"Origins.\"\n \n From a letter to Alfred Russel Wallace:\n \nIt is, however, a great objection to this term that it cannot be used as a substantive governing a verb; and that this is a real objection I infer from H. Spencer continually using the words, natural selection. I formerly thought, probably in an exaggerated degree, that it was a great advantage to bring into connection natural and artificial selection; this indeed led me to use a term in common, and I still think it some advantage. I wish I had received your letter two months ago, for I would have worked in \"the survival, etc.,\" often in the new edition of the 'Origin,' which is now almost printed off, and of which I will of course send you a copy. I will use the term in my next book on Domestic Animals, etc., from which, by the way, I plainly see that you expect MUCH, too much. The term Natural Selection has now been so largely used abroad and at home, that I doubt whether it could be given up, and with all its faults I should be sorry to see the attempt made. Whether it will be rejected must now depend \"on the survival of the fittest.\" As in time the term must grow intelligible the objections to its use will grow weaker and weaker. I doubt whether the use of any term would have made the subject intelligible to some minds, clear as it is to others;\n\n I know that it will be tough for you to understand what Darwin is saying. I find Victorian English a bit obtuse. For you it will no doubt be almost impossible.\n \nThis same poster, posting under a different alias has asked me the same question before (which I didn't answer), yet felt quite inclined to criticse the Orthodox Church. I used his own argument on him, to show how hypocritical he is, because he's not read any of the ecumenical councils, or the Holy Fathers etc.), yet feels perfectly inclined to, as I say, attack the Orthodox Church.\n\n Sorry. It wasn't me. Why would anyone ask if you had read Darwin in reference to the Orthodox Church? I don't see any reason to attack the Orthodox Church. I don't see it as any better or worse than many other religions. But it seems that you make it a habbit to post quotes from books that you haven't read.\n \nAs pointed out then, rules of engagement should be universally applied, and also as I pointed out back then, there is a disgusting lack of bravery on the part of your camp that doesn't also seek to apply these rules universally. As you do now, you come in and attempt to point score, rather than debate. I will watch out in future to see how readily you allow such blatant mistakes from your own camp slip by. It tells a lot about the level of honesty you bring to debate.\n\n And you object when asked a simple question that it is an ad hominem? It seems that you lack the courage to admit that you haven't read Darwin and were depending on the opinion of someone else and expressing it as your own.\n \n Compare what I said with what you claimed I said and then tell me about lack of honesty. What is really bizarre is that in arguing against the straw man that you invented, you actually support what I said. Maybe I am being too harsh in doubting Monty's honesty. Perhaps he has even more difficulty in understanding English than I had previously thought. Certainly, anyone who claims that any word used in the title of a book is a noun has no concept of basic grammar.\n \n Anyway, notice that even Monty's quotes from Darwin supports what I said. I said that Darwin's use of the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was always preceded or followed by a reference to natural selection. Here are all of Darwin's uses of \"susvival of the fittest\" from Chapter IV, entitled Natural Selection; Or the Survival of the Fittest. This is from the 6th edition.\n \nThis preservation of favourable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest.\n \n Nature, if I may be allowed to personify the natural preservation or survival of the fittest, cares nothing for appearances, except in so far as they are useful to any being.\n \n Illustrations of the Action of Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest\n \n In cases of this kind, if the variation were of a beneficial nature, the original form would soon be supplanted by the modified form, through the survival of the fittest. (Note: the above follows a discussion of what we call today differential reproductive success - in other words, the action of natural selection)\n \n Slow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much by artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may have been effected in the long course of time through nature's power of selection, that is by the survival of the fittest.\n \n On our theory the continued existence of lowly organisms offers no difficulty; for natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, does not necessarily include progressive development- it only takes advantage of such variations as arise and are beneficial to each creature under its complex relations of life.\n \n This principle of preservation, or the survival of the fittest, I have called Natural Selection.\n\n Also note that in the letter quoted above Darwin talks about the \"survival of the fittest\" term as a name for his theory. As it turns out, the Wallace/Spencer term has been mostly rejected by evolutionary scientists because it is so easy to misunderstand. That was Darwin's objection. Evolutionary scientists use the term natural selection almost exclusively. It is recognized as only one of several mechanisms of evoluiton.",

In challenging Monty I thought I was making it quite clear that I was talking about books that Charles Darwin had written, specifically, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection.

I used his own argument on him, to show how hypocritical he is, because he's not read any of the ecumenical councils, or the Holy Fathers etc.), yet feels perfectly inclined to, as I say, attack the Orthodox Church.\n\n \n Do you think such behavior is always \"hypocritical?\"\n \n \nAs pointed out then, rules of engagement should be universally applied, and also as I pointed out back then, there is a disgusting lack of bravery on the part of your camp that doesn't also seek to apply these rules universally.\n\n \n Do you?\n \n \nAs you do now, you come in and attempt to point score, rather than debate.\n\n \n It was a fair question, and deserved an answer, no less than your question to a critic as to whether or not he had actually read the material he was criticizing.\n \n \nI will watch out in future to see how readily you allow such blatant mistakes from your own camp slip by. It tells a lot about the level of honesty you bring to debate.\n\n \n I'm still curious. Have you read these books?",

   "Monty\n \n You're doing the bait and switch again. Here is what I said:\n \nMonty starts his last post with a falicy. He says, \"The heart of Darwinism is survival of the fittest.\" Monty is dead wrong. Darwin objected to the phrase applied to his theories from the first day he heard it. It became popular and Darwin was finally persuaded to use it by Wallace, the co-discoverer of the theory of natural selection. Darwin used it in the 4th edition of \"Origins,\" ALWAYS either preceded or followed by a reference to natural selection. \"Survival of the fittest\" is a tautology. Fitness is determined by survival and those that survive are the fittest. That is not Darwinism - not even on the surface.\n\n So Monty, you made a mistake and when I pointed it out, you responded with quotes that supported my points. You showed quotes from the 6th edition of 'Origin', each of which tacked 'survival of the fittest' onto a reference to natural selection. Yep! That's what I said.\n \n But then I asked you if you had actually read Darwin and understood the context of the quotes. You still haven't had the courage to admit that you haven't read any of Darwin's works. Thus, we can conclude that you are merely parroting the thoughts of someone else.\n \n You were obviously embarrassed because of your speaking out without knowledge so you claim that asking you a question is an ad hominem. But that's not the worst of it. You actually deliberately misstate what I said. You asked Barbarian: \n \nDo you think he's wrong when he stated that Darwin never used the term \"Survival of the Fittest?\"\n\n Clearly that isn't true. Do you have a reading problem, a problem with understanding English, or just a proplem in admitting a mistake?\n \n If \"survival of the fittest\" were at the heart of Darwinism, then Darwin wouldn't have waited at least 7 years before he used it. As I showed you, he didn't like the phrase and preferred natural selection. He predicted that one or the other would fall into disuse. He was right. 'Survival of the fittest' isn't used by evolutionary biologists.\n \n By the way, Darwin didn't like the use of the word 'evolution' applied to his theories either. That use was popularized by T.H. Huxley I think. Darwin lost out on that count and the word 'evolution' became the name of the process and the theories.\n \n I will accept you appology for misrepresenting what I said. I suspect that you aren't man enough to offer it.",

   "To Ursus maritimus:\n I agree that the data and observations in the present may be applied to the past. You interestingly bring up the Global Flood of Noah's day. You would be incorrect by stating that we do not see the effects that we would expect to see if there was a global flood. If there was a flood, we would expect to see millions of creatures to be burried in sedimentary rock all around the world, would we not? And do you know what? That is what we observe!! We would also expect to see high mountains and that the Earth is mainly covered by water (70%). Uluru and many Australian features also provides very strong evidence that many of Australia's landforms formed quickly a short time ago. The evolutionists believe that these landforms formed over eons of years by gradual processes. These Australian landforms easily discard these ideas. There are many evidences that point to both a young universe and a young Earth. You also point out that creation scientists didn't find anything to support the idea of a Global Flood, to whom are you refering to when you say this? Answers in Genesis has many evidences that point to a Global Flood and a young Earth. Isn't that kind of weird?\n\n \n To go along with that...I just dont understand how evolutionsists can keep saying that fossils are the result of slow burial. I cant believe that organisms remained in tact and kept such minute detail, as is observed today in many fossils, if they sat there and waited to be buried over a period of years. In order for there to be such good detail a fast burial had to have taken place. This of course is quite possible from a worldwide flood.\n \n Also to go along with evidence for a worldwide flood is the fact that there have been dinosaur fossils and other land animals found in close proximity with sea creatures. For example there was a crab found fossilized next to a dinousaur skeleton. This is good evidence for a worldwide flood.",

You certainly seem embarrassed that he did, thus bringing into the frame the facts\n a) he didn't coin the phrase\n b) he was convinced reluctantly only by others.\n Whilst these are true, the emphasis seems to be rather apologetic. Darwin decided, of his own free will, to use a term you aptly describe as a tautology. That he would 'switch' to using a tautology you see as not being significant. You're pointing out that someone else came up with the term, or that he didn't use it for 'x' years is irrelevant by the simple fact that even after 'x' years, he decided to change, because he felt it was a better term.*\n \n I will also state I have read neither book. I studied pre-history with reference to the books, but our subject dealt more with evolutionary theory as then current (mid-1980's). But I don't see why you place so much emphasis on whether I've read them, as we're dealing with the phrasing, which we both agree is a tautology.\n \n It also doesn't detract from the sad logical bind you're in. You say one term is a tautology. But they are synonymous, as you say, they are always used in conjunction with each other, and the fact Darwin joins them together, making them interchangeable. My quote showed Wallace convince him that the phrase \"Survival of the Fittest\" was a better way of putting down the idea of \"Natural Selection\".\n \n By saying one is a tautology, you are saying both are tautologies.\n \n Secondly, clearly Darwin thought that \"Survival of the Fittest\" was a better way of explaining his idea. His idea, the heart of Darwinism didn't change, only the term used to explain it. Thus, \"Survival of the Fittest\" is at the heart of Darwin. Even if he only changed it on his death-bed, the very fact he did was because he himself thought it was a better way of explaining his idea.\n \n But still you want to go on about whether or not I've read the book.

   "But my conclusion is that the reason there are such similarities among different species is because they all have the same Creator. God doesn't change.\n\n \n We are not talking about mere \"similarities\" here, u. Look at the skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis (\"Lucy\"). This species is definitely a non-human ape. the skull looks much more like a chimpanzee's than a modern human's. Yet, this ape was bipedal -- it walked upright just like you and I.\n \n What is more, as ungerdunn pointed out, its arms were intermediate in length between that of a chimpanzee and a modern human. This is exactly what we would expect from evolution. What is it about \"similarities\" that explains this from the point of view of creationism?\n \n Ungerdunn pointed out that Lucy's species have wrist bones that \"lock\" much like the knuckle walking chimpanzee. This feature makes no sense in a bipedal species such as Lucy's -- what is it about similarity that requires bipedal Lucy to have kuckle-walking wrist bones? According to evolution, this makes perfect sense -- A. afarensis is a transitional species, it is fully bipedal, and is in the process of losing the other vestiges of knuckle-walking.\n \n This, again, is the famous picture. Look at the skulls. Why did god create so many species of apes that neatly bridge the gap between chimp-like A. afarensis and modern humans? We are not just talking about \"similarities\" -- we are talking about specific kinds of similarities, namely how, morphologically, these species bridge the gap from what are assumed to be ancestors to modern species.\n \n Look again at the heirarchical classification of life. Again, we are not talking mere similarities -- we are talking about a pattern that suggests a family tree. Simply saying that similar creatures suggest a similar designer -- that doesn't cut it, I'm afraid. Mammals are much more similar to each other than they are to teleost fish, and teleost fish are much more similar to each other than they are to mammals. Was there a mammal designer and a fish designer? Was the mammal designer jealous of fish, so he created mammal-whales? And mammals and fish are much more similar to each other than they are to insects; were the mammal designer and fish designer subordinate to a vertebrate designer, and the insect designer and crustacean designer subordinate to an arthropod designer? Were the arthropod designer and vertebrate designer subordinate to an animal designer?\n \n \"Similar designer\" is just too facile. It simply does not explain the patterns that we see. Similarities? We aren't discussing similarities -- we are discussing classification based on similarities and differences! Similarities? We are discussing why we see the \"gaps\" between different taxa filled in, just as evolution predicts.",

At least you have the excuse that you have never read anything by Darwin to blame for you failure to understand what Darwin thought. I guess you haven't been reading what I said either. I never expressed any thoughts about the significance of Darwin's use of the phrase.\n \n More importantly, Darwin didn't \"switch\" to using a tautology. He added it to to the text, always linked to his own phrase, \"natural selection.\" The reason was that it had come into popular use so he decided to add it.\n \nYou're [sic] There's that problem you have in understanding and using English pointing out that someone else came up with the term, or that he didn't use it for 'x' years is irrelevant by the simple fact that even after 'x' years, he decided to change, because he felt it was a better term.*\n\n Nope. If you had read Darwin maybe you would be aware of what he really thought. He never switched from calling his theory natural selection. He never thought it was a better term. You're just making it up to make it seem as if your point were valid.\n \nI will also state I have read neither book. I studied pre-history with reference to the books, but our subject dealt more with evolutionary theory as then current (mid-1980's). But I don't see why you place so much emphasis on whether I've read them, as we're dealing with the phrasing, which we both agree is a tautology.\n\n I place emphasis on whether you have read them or not because you clearly don't understand what you are talking about. You expressed an opinion as to what is the heart of Darwinism and you were wrong. Now you are continuing to invent and misrepresent in order to make it look as if you are correct. You aren't. \"Survival of the fittest\" isn't at the heart of Darwinism. Differential reproductive success of organisms that possess advantageous heritable characteristics is.\n \nIt also doesn't detract from the sad logical bind you're in.\n\n Here comes more invention and misunderstanding.\n \nYou say one term is a tautology.\n\n Yes it is. But apparently you don't understand what that is or why that is. Perhaps you wouldn't make the horrible mistake in common sense that follows if you understood what it is.\n \nBut they are synonymous, as you say, they are always used in conjunction with each other, and the fact Darwin joins them together, making them interchangeable.\n\n But they aren't synonyms. They aren't always used in conjunction. I pointed out to you that evolutionary biologists don't use the phrase. You are easily confused. Darwin used the phrase because it had come into common use, but he always linked it to his term, natural selection which he explained in great detail. It is clear that natural selection isn't a tautology. But you wouldn't know that since you don't understand natural selection.\n \nMy quote showed Wallace convince him that the phrase \"Survival of the Fittest\" was a better way of putting down the idea of \"Natural Selection\".\n\n Funny that you didn't quote Darwin. Funny that you didn't read the quote that I gave you where Darwin wrote to Wallace about his decision. But not having read any of Darwin, you can be expected to misunderstand when your only information comes from footnotes on internet web sites.\n \nBy saying one is a tautology, you are saying both are tautologies.\n\n No I'm not. I am saying that \"survival of the fittest\" is a poor description of Darwin's theory of natural selection specifically because it is a tautology. It confuses the issue.\n \nSecondly, clearly Darwin thought that \"Survival of the Fittest\" was a better way of explaining his idea.\n\n You are making things up. Darwin didn't think it was a better way of explaining anything precisely because it doesn't explain anything. It was a simple phrase in common use amoung non-scientists. If Darwin thought that it was better, they he wouldn't have gone to such lengths to explain natural selection and to explain why he was linking the common term.\n \nHis idea, the heart of Darwinism didn't change, only the term used to explain it.\n\n Again, the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" doesn't explain anything. In fact, it is quite misleading when one considers what Darwin's theory actually is. But you wouldn't know that since you didn't even bother to learn what Darwin actually said.\n \nThus, \"Survival of the Fittest\" is at the heart of Darwin. Even if he only changed it on his death-bed, the very fact he did was because he himself thought it was a better way of explaining his idea.\n\n He didn't change it. You are misrepresenting the truth again. He added a less desirable phrase because it was in popular use. He always either explained natural selection or specifically mentioned natural selection to make sure that it was understood. Darwin never thought the phrase was better. He only used it in order to avoid confusion.\n \nBut still you want to go on about whether or not I've read the book.\n\n Yes. You misrepresented what Darwin thought. You represented your words as indicative of the meaning of Darwinism, and yet you never read what he said. You made yourself an authority on a topic with which you were not familiar.\n \nYou have claimed that you have a special gnosis about the work, assuming you've read it also. You've not attempted to elaborate on your interpretation of it, only wishing to point score on a personal level.\n\n I didn't claim any special knowledge. Why do you insist on inventing things. It makes you look dishonest. And I did elaborate. I thought I gave a pretty good summary of Darwinism. Oh well. I didn't think you would understand and I was correct.\n \n*Your argument would only work if he recanted and stopped using the term\n\n That's not logical. Your argument would only work if Darwin had stopped using the term 'natural selection'. He didn't \"switch\" terms.\n \n And I also pointed out that in trying to link Darwinism with Hitler you were mistaken. Hitler misapplied social Darwinism. The only connection between Darwin and social Darwinism is that his name was incorrectly applied to the social theory. Social Darwinism was the brain child of Herbert Spencer, who coined the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" that was misapplied by the common people to Darwin's theory of natural selection.",

Perhaps you wouldn't make the horrible mistake in common sense that follows if you understood what it is.\n\n \n A tautology is a meaningless phrase...\n Logic. An empty or vacuous statement composed of simpler statements in a fashion that makes it logically true whether the simpler statements are factually true or false; for example, the statement Either it will rain tomorrow or it will not rain tomorrow.\n \n We have both agreed on this. Get over it.\n \n But they are synonymous, as you say, they are always used in conjunction with each other, and the fact Darwin joins them together, making them interchangeable. \n Most recently you said...\n \nBut they aren't synonyms. They aren't always used in conjunction. I pointed out to you that evolutionary biologists don't use the phrase. You are easily confused. Darwin used the phrase because it had come into common use, but he always linked it to his term, natural selection which he explained in great detail. It is clear that natural selection isn't a tautology. But you wouldn't know that since you don't understand natural selection.\n\n \n But earlier you said...\n Post 113\n \n Darwin objected to the phrase applied to his theories from the first day he heard it. It became popular and Darwin was finally persuaded to use it by Wallace, the co-discoverer of the theory of natural selection. Darwin used it in the 4th edition of \"Origins,\" ALWAYS either preceded or followed by a reference to natural selection. \"Survival of the fittest\" is a tautology. Fitness is determined by survival and those that survive are the fittest.\n\n \n You said that \"Survival of the Fittest\" is always (your emphasis) used in conjunction with \"Natural Selection\" you even berated me when I made the mistake of saying that you didn't. Then you berate me for not saying \"I'm sorry\" when I realised my mistake. Now, after spending some time saying one thing, you say they aren't always used in conjunction?\n \n You also enter an irrelevance about that modern evolutionary biologists don't use the term; this is because it's a tautology. Then not only do you say they aren't always used in conjunction but that he always linked it to his term. This is a new understanding of English. So, you argue now that he never used them in 'conjunction' but he always 'linked' them.\n \n \n My quote showed Wallace convince him that the phrase \"Survival of the Fittest\" was a better way of putting down the idea of \"Natural Selection\". \n Funny that you didn't quote Darwin. Funny that you didn't read the quote that I gave you where Darwin wrote to Wallace about his decision. But not having read any of Darwin, you can be expected to misunderstand when your only information comes from footnotes on internet web sites.\n By saying one is a tautology, you are saying both are tautologies. \n\n \n \nNo I'm not. I am saying that \"survival of the fittest\" is a poor description of Darwin's theory of natural selection specifically because it is a tautology. It confuses the issue.\n\n \n You said it was a tautology\n Post 113\n \n \"Survival of the fittest\" is a tautology. Fitness is determined by survival and those that survive are the fittest. \n\n \n We have agreed to this, but still you beat around the bush by trying to use other phrases now, like 'not a good describer'. As I said, we agree it's a tautology. Get over it.\n \n \n Secondly, clearly Darwin thought that \"Survival of the Fittest\" was a better way of explaining his idea. \n\n \n \nYou are making things up. Darwin didn't think it was a better way of explaining anything precisely because it doesn't explain anything. It was a simple phrase in common use among non-scientists. If Darwin thought that it was better, they he wouldn't have gone to such lengths to explain natural selection and to explain why he was linking the common term. \n\n \n I repeat....from the 1859 edition...\n \"Darwin used the term \"natural selection\" in his book \"On the Origin of Species\" but was persuaded that Spencer's phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was probably 'more convenient' \"\n http://www.perceptions.couk.com/genes1.html#rst\n Further\n \"Darwin did not believe that the environment was producing the variation within the finch populations. He correctly thought that the variation already existed and that nature just selected for the most suitable beak shape and against less useful ones. Darwin and his supporters ultimately described this process as the \"survival of the fittest.\" This is very different from Lamarck's incorrect idea that the environment altered the shape of individuals and that these acquired changes were then inherited.\"\n http://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_2.htm\n What do you think 'more convenient' means here? It is clear Darwin wanted to use it, because it was a better way of explaining things.\n \n I give you a new quote...\n \"Darwin himself was uneasy with the term (natural selection). In the sixth and last edition of the Origin, he says that survival of the fittest is a \"more accurate\" expression of what he had previously called natural selection.\"\n http://www.trufax.org/avoid/nazi.html\n \n His idea, the heart of Darwinism didn't change, only the term used to explain it. Thus 'survival of the fittest' IS at the heart of Darwinism.\n \n Again, the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" doesn't explain anything. In fact, it is quite misleading when one considers what Darwin's theory actually is. But you wouldn't know that since you didn't even bother to learn what Darwin actually said.\n \n \nThus, \"Survival of the Fittest\" is at the heart of Darwin. Even if he only changed it on his death-bed, the very fact he did was because he himself thought it was a better way of explaining his idea. \n\n \n \nHe didn't change it. You are misrepresenting the truth again. He added a less desirable phrase because it was in popular use. He always either explained natural selection or specifically mentioned natural selection to make sure that it was understood. Darwin never thought the phrase was better. He only used it in order to avoid confusion. \n\n \n He always linked them, according to you. The fact he termed it 'Natural Selection OR Survival of the Fittest' shows that they are synonymous.\n \n \nBut still you want to go on about whether or not I've read the book. \n\n \n \nYes. You misrepresented what Darwin thought. You represented your words as indicative of the meaning of Darwinism, and yet you never read what he said. You made yourself an authority on a topic with which you were not familiar. \n\n \n Well, I said I made a mistake. You don't want to let it go, and then you are so eager to defend his tautology, you now say that you never said that they were always used in 'conjunction, but that they were always 'linked'.\n \n Also, if you want to present a case for what you believe Darwin has said, then just saying \"You don't understand the book\" doesn't equate to an argument. Try factoring in some of his work into you argument or it amounts to mere opinion. If your purpose is to 'educate' the masses, this is what you would do, otherwise your purpose is to enter these debates and opinionates against anyone who offers alternative views from your own (mine are backed with quotes).\n \n \n You have claimed that you have a special gnosis about the work, assuming you've read it also. You've not attempted to elaborate on your interpretation of it, only wishing to point score on a personal level. \n\n \n \nI didn't claim any special knowledge. Why do you insist on inventing things. It makes you look dishonest. And I did elaborate. I thought I gave a pretty good summary of Darwinism. Oh well. I didn't think you would understand and I was correct \n.\n \n You are claiming a special knowledge that only you reading the whole book can give you an insight into why Darwin decided to switch from the term \"Natural Selection\" to that of \"Survival of the Fittest\".\n \n \n*Your argument would only work if he recanted and stopped using the term \n\n \n \nThat's not logical. Your argument would only work if Darwin had stopped using the term 'natural selection'. He didn't \"switch\" terms. \n\n \n You are trying an apology for Darwin. By saying that it wasn't even his idea, or that he was persuaded only after it entered into popular culture. Then you say that he always used them in conjunction, then he didn't, but he always 'linked' them. The ideas are linked, used in conjunction or whatever, BY DARWIN. He made the decision because he thought it was a better way of getting across his idea. My source also agrees with this. So far you conjecture something illogical based on your embarrassment that he'd ever use the term in the first place.\n He says quite clearly\n \"This preservation of favourable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest.\"\n http://www.infidels.org/library/his...s/Chapter4.html\n He's admitting it he says \"I have called it...\", he's saying I call it 'one thing' OR 'the other'. He is making the link himself.\n \n In fact, he states it's a better term\n \"But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.\"\n from the 6th edition of \"Origin of the Species\"\n http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species-6th-edition/chapter-03.html\n \n Everyone I've quoted, including Darwin himself, recognises that the use of the term 'Survival of the Fittest\" supplanted his former term \"Natural Selection\". It didn't replace the 'idea', just the terminology. He thought that a tautology was a better way of explaining his idea.\n \n You claim you have a special insight into what Darwin really means that is greater than mine. I have yet to see how you construct your idea, other then you just supposing that I am wrong. You fight fact with opinion. You also try to discredit me on the basis whether I've read the book, not whether I've studied the terminologies.\n \n Here ends the first part of the argument. Now begins another...\n \n \nAnd I also pointed out that in trying to link Darwinism with Hitler you were mistaken. Hitler misapplied social Darwinism. The only connection between Darwin and social Darwinism is that his name was incorrectly applied to the social theory. Social Darwinism was the brain child of Herbert Spencer, who coined the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" that was misapplied by the common people to Darwin's theory of natural selection. \n\n \n But Darwin used the term \"Survival of the Fittest\", he also wrote about competing species, including lesser humans; which the Germans use the word Untermensch for; literally sub-human - a term they employed when describing the Jews and other undesirable races.\n \n I made it clear that Darwin did not advocate genocide.\n \n However, the whole idea of whether it's been applied, or misapplied is not based on science, but on your philosophy. For a Nazi, doing experiments on people resulted in their idea that the people they were experimenting on were less than human. The 'science' is amoral. It is the people who apply it that are moral, and make moral decisions, and these decisions affect what type of science they will apply and how they use it, and how it gives them results.\n emoticon_ic",

   "I am glad we have an opportunity to continue the debate. I for one have learnt a lot more, for it.*\n \n \nI did not get into the tautology debate. \n\n \n Not true (as far as I recall) I said that \"Survival of the Fittest\" was the centre of Darwinism, and Ungerdunn and I went hammer and tongs for a while before I showed that even Darwin used this term as a better example. I am amazed you've been quiet on this... seeing as you said that Darwin made such a great case (see post I quoted in my last outing, #157).\n \n It is an important issue for you and I, seeing as you place so much faith in Darwin, and I so little in him.\n \n \nI assumed your basic message is that after considering things like Nazi atrocities the only conclusion is that there is a God that has a perfect truth that contradicts evolution. I attempted to express my doubts and then you told me about tautologies and Nazi experiments.\n\n \n No, I believe that science is value-ridden and ultimately flawed. And, though it produces nice things such as digital watches, and stops apples from falling upwards, ultimately does not bring us closer to God. I'm surprised you've not gone for the obvious criticism that just because I believe one thing about science, doesn't mean that God necessarily exists. I understand that there's no link between the two positions, at least from what I've stated here on these posts. However I am not here, necessarily to convince people of the truth of God. I am here to convince people that their faith in science arranged against faith in God is not so steady; it is an oft repeated (mantra) that science and evolution is 'reason' and creation therefore must be 'unreasonable'. In fact science can't really prove anything. (On another forum I faced people who derided the Bible based on their belief that the only truths, (regardless of your definition) could only be discernable through science.\n \n And besides, attack is the best defence\n \n \n I flatly admit I still do not understand how your points support what I think is your basic message. If your message just that humans and consequently human science cannot perfectly answer all questions then Nazi scientists are not entirely irrelevant but I still don't see how they are the best of examples. I honestly have trouble distinguishing your statements about Nazis using the word evolution and someone saying \"Nazis tried to make the trains run on time so we should not bother making the trains run on time\".\n\n \n From my understanding, you argue that science is of itself value neutral. That being so, then the Nazis using evolution is in fact showing science study without the constraints of Judeo-Christian morals - that is, they were freed to pursue human experiments. Any derision we have for the Nazis is based on our own philosophy. You should have no problem then with them using science to test on unwilling humans, because it is all in the name of science; and who knows might benefit us as a species. Any objections you have towards these experiments is based on philosophy, not science. That is principally why the sites we discussed called it 'bad science'.\n \n (I would argue that the Nazis weren't value-neutral, either. Just as we have Judeo-Christian philosophical constraints preventing the science that they conducted, they have Nazi ideology urging them on).\n \n * Though of course I believe I'm right \n :p",

Darwin didn't think it was a better way of explaining anything precisely because it doesn't explain anything. It was a simple phrase in common use amoung (sic) non-scientists. If Darwin thought that it was better, they he wouldn't have gone to such lengths to explain natural selection and to explain why he was linking the common term.\n\n \n \nHe didn't change it.

I'm going by what you two said. I believed you when you said \"Survival of the Fittest\" is a tautology. Then you equated the two phrases, making them synonymous. The fact Darwin thought a tautology was a better describer of \"Natural Selection\" is itself something you've not admitted. So we have two phrases, one of which we agree is a tautology, the other is equated with it, or used instead of it. I would hope that this is akin to you admitting it is a tautology, or it's equal. I will say it's not literally a tautology, but it is logically if you define one phrase with another, as you have done.\n \n Post 128\n \nYou have already agreed that \"Survival of the Fittest\" is a tautology. So, in fact you are now saying that Darwin was persuaded by Wallace to use a meaningless term in place of his term 'Natural Selection'. And as they are interchangeable, then as one is meaningless, so is the other. It is akin to saying Wallace persuaded Darwin to use a tautology that was a better way of describing his idea.\n \n That you say he used one tautology in connection with a meaningless term helps your case how?\n\n \n Post 113\n \n Darwin objected to the phrase applied to his theories from the first day he heard it. It became popular and Darwin was finally persuaded to use it by Wallace, the co-discoverer of the theory of natural selection. Darwin used it in the 4th edition of \"Origins,\" ALWAYS either preceded or followed by a reference to natural selection. \"Survival of the fittest\" is a tautology. Fitness is determined by survival and those that survive are the fittest. \n\n \n They are always used in conjunction. Darwin called the chapter \"Natural Selection OR Survival of the Fittest\" he equates them, you do too. What's your problem?\n Survival of the Fittest, doesn't even mean survival of the fittest...\n Post 126\n \nOn our theory the continued existence of lowly organisms offers no difficulty; for natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, does not necessarily include progressive development - it only takes advantage of such variations as arise and are beneficial to each creature under its complex relations of life.\n\n \n \n But, Barbarian. Obviously Monty doesn't know the esential (sic) parts of Darwin's theory. His purpose is to link Darwin to the genocide of Hitler. But he didn't even know that Darwin didn't coin the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" until I told him. He was totally unaware that it was coined as a description of Spencer's economic theories and that it was Spencer's theories that were misapplied by Hitler. He had to be told that this was the case.\n\n \n What an ego you have. You posted under different disguises before, so you either have lost some memory, or you never read anything I wrote before either...\n What you say is simply false...\n \n Post 41 of \"Another mistake?\"\n Post title: \"Survival of the Fittest in an historical context\"\n \n?Survival of the Fittest? was a term first coined by pioneer sociologist Herbert Spencer\n http://www2.truman.edu/~rgraber/cultev/spencer.html \n\n \n Post 9 of \"The many faces of science\"\n \nHerbert Spencer had already coined the phrase ?Survival of the Fittest?. Darwin?s own thought processes were influenced by the growing imperialism around him. \n\n \n Post 51 of \"The Many Faces of Science\"\n \n Gormless and Void (hey, wait, that sounds like a law firm). Anyway, Herbert Spencer did come up with the tautology, however, importantly, Darwin adopted it for later editions of his books... so again everyone gets the blame, except for Darwin. \n\n \n All you needed to do was do a search by author (me, in this case), with the word \"Spencer\", and you'd have saved yourself the embarrassment of making egotistical claims that are false; remember what I said earlier about you guys mixing up opinion with fact? Obviously you don't think that applies to you.\n \n \nAnd when he was babbling about Hitler and Nazi science I asked him about Nazi Christianity. If it is a valid objection to science that Hitler misapplied it for his own ends, then it is also a valid objection to Christianity that Hitler misapplied that. Monty ignored that question because it shows the falicy(sic) of his logic.\n\n \n Applying Christianity would be false comparison because Christianity has stated moral values, science does not (that I am aware of; perhaps you can list the moral aims of science). Christ's teachings on morality are quite clear. What are science's teachings on morality, so we can compare them as you are doing?\n \n Show me, using science (not philosophy as you do here), how Nazi science was misapplied, and you'll have your case!\n \n \nAt any rate, you just keep sending out those victory claims in PMs every time you find that you can no longer hold your end up in the discussion.

   "\"From time to time, attacks on neo-Darwinism are mounted, usually by persons who either see evolutionary theory as antireligious or who basically misunderstand Darwin's theory. One attack, entitled \"Darwin's Mistakes,\" by Tom Bethell, was published in Harper's magazine.\n Bethell began by pointing out that Darwinian theory is a tautology rather than a predicative theory. (The term tautology means a statement that is true by definition.)* That is, evolution is the survival of the fittest. But who are the fittest? Obviously, the individuals who survive. Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival, we are left with the statement that evolution is the survival of the survivors. This indeed is a tautology. But it is possible to assign independent criteria for fitness. Darwin wrote extensively about artificial selection in pigeons, in which the breeders' choice was the criterion for fitness. (Many novel breeds of pigeon have been created this way.) Artificial selection has been practiced extensively by plant and animal breeders. Here too, survival is not the criterion for fitness, productivity is.\"\n Robert H Tamarin, (1996) \"Principles of Genetics\" (5th ed), p571.\n \n Note here, that although they do deal with the 'tautology' claim they aren't so much interested in this but to present an apology; to show it at work; as present the example used of artificial selection! Where in nature does nature produce a cow that would die, unless it was milked twice a day? It doesn't because the cow would die! They simply string words together, that other people 'don't understand', yet by their own example, they show not natural selection, but artifical selection.\n \n Note also they say \"Possible to assign criteria...\" where does nature do this?\n \n In other words their proof of survival of the fittest not being a tautology comes not from nature, but from creative and intelligent design (in their example, a breeder of birds)",

   "Ungerdunn, I think your anger is misplaced. You made an appallingly low attack on me with regards to not knowing about Herbert Spencer's coining of the phrase. I pointed this out, as I have done so in private; that you are making mistakes. Instead you see fit to return, make no apology with regard to this false claim and instead go to name-calling and repeating a question you think is embarrassing, but which I've already answered.\n \n I reply to you here, in public because I understand that if I do so in public, you will just make up whatever you wish. Plus, I am here to inform other people, not just you, and they can read this conversation for themselves and make up their own minds...\n \n \nYes it is. But apparently you don't understand what that is or why that is. Perhaps you wouldn't make the horrible mistake in common sense that follows if you understood what it is.\n \n Again I think that it is your inability to understand clear English that is a fault. The phrase \"survival of the fittest\" is a tautology. The phrase \"natural selection\" is not. Both are intended only as titles for a complex scientific theory. When analyzed, \"survival of the fittest\" results in a tautology. When analyzed, \"natural selection\" does not. The theory that each is claimed to represent is not.\n\n \n Darwin equates them (see quote below). Even you do here, that they are both titles for the same theory.\n \n \nPlease specify what works of Darwin you have read.\n\n \n Your aggression is unbalancing your line of argument, making you repeat questions that have already been answered. I answered both you and another poster who thought this was a 'winner'. For your reference, post 139 deals with this.\n \n \nPerhaps you didn't understand the question when it was asked the first time. You do seem to have a problem with English. What is your native language?\n\n \n Perhaps you want to point out where you said it. If you are genuinely about debate, and education then you will. If not, you are about name-calling and point-scoring.\n \n \nInteresting that you make absolutely no concession to the fact you were wrong about Darwin using one term (Survival of the Fittest) in preference to the other (Natural Selection). \n\n \n \nBut he didn't. Darwin preferred his term, natural selection, always. Darwin's term has become the accepted term to the absolute exclusion of 'survival of the fittest.' You keep posting links to internet sites that support your position without ever citing Darwin. I told you where you might find the information and you don't seem to have had the fortitude to read it.\n\n \n He did. In his sixth edition\n I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term natural selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient. We have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of slight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature.\n http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species-6th-edition/chapter-03.html\n \n You claim only to have read his first edition. Perhaps if you want to argue about Darwin's change of mind, you need to access a more up-to-date edition.\n \n \nBut more important, the questions about your knowledge of natural selection still go unanswered. Look back to Barbarian's questions. Why didn't you answer? Are you embarressed (sic) by your ignorance? No need. Just ask a question and Barbarian will be pleased to explain. He is quite good at it. Sadly, the scientifically illiterate, such as you, do not more frequently take him up on his constant offers to educate.\n\n \n You keep on with this ad hominem, but quite clearly Darwin said \"Survival of the Fittest\" is more accurate.\n \n \nIsn't it strange that you claim to cite Darwin and you haven't bothered to check out your own sources. \"Page cannot be found\" doesn't offer a whole lot of support to your position. Nevertheless, your argument seems to rely on \"convenience.\" Amazing. That's what I told you several exchanges ago. You seem to have a problem with basic English.\n\n \n Another sad little outburst.\n \n \nYou have implied you have read Darwin's work, but you missed that! \n\n \n \nDon't be stupid. I read the first edition. I never claimed that I had read all of Darwin's works in all editions. Please name which of Darwin's works you have read and which editions. Please don't ignore this request since you have implied that you have actually read one or more of Darwin's works. If you have not, then you have lied. But I guess that is OK for someone who claims to be a Christian.\n\n \n Another rant.\n \n \n:\n Originally Posted by Monty\n Further, not only that, but you still want to go for the ad hominem about my level of reading. \n That isn't an ad hominem. It is an observation that is supported by you failure to understand what is an ad hominem. You also accused Barbarian of an ad hominem when he asked a question. It seems that you don't know what an ad hominem is.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by montypoos\n Just ignoring what Darwin says does not, as far as I can see, help your case. \n But I haven't ignored Darwin. You see, I have actually read Darwin as well as many other sources on evolutionary biology. You haven't. How is it that you, who admits that you haven't read any relevant texts by Darwin, rely on out of context quotes that you parrot from creationist sites, and still claim superior knowledge.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by montypoos\n Tell me then what you believe he means when he says he's decided to use this tautology because it is more accurate ? \n I already did. Do you have a problem with English? I gave you a quote. Perhaps you weren't paying attention.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by poos\n Applying Christianity would be false comparison because Christianity has stated moral values, science does not \n Way to take the high ground! It doesn't ring true. Hitler attempted to exterminate the Jews because he believed that he was doing his moral duty. Hitler applied the moral values that he understood from his Christian education and murdered millions.\n \n Let me see if I understand what you are saying. You claim that since Hitler attempted to exterminate Jews based on his moral principles that it was OK. If it were based on science (a stupid idea) it would be wrong. Is that the position of Orthodox Christianity?\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by poos\n What are science's teachings on morality, so we can compare them as you are doing? \n Only a scientific illiterate would ask about the application of science to morality. There is none. Morality is a consideration outside of the realm of science. Science does not teach morality.\n That is not to say that science should not be constrained by moral considerations. Morality is basically what is acceptable to society.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by poos\n Hey, you just keep posting opinion as fact, you're really undermining you're own cause every time you post!. \n Actually I didn't. What I did was to challenge you to support your assertions. since you made the assertions, the onus is on you to support them. Sadly, you haven't offered anything that supports your position. You have shown that you have no understanding of evolutionary theory, natural selection, or for that matter, the concept of \"survival of the fittest.\"\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by poo\n PS Private Messages - go look up 'private', did I give you permission to use what I wrote? \n Then you are embarressed?

One thing that you don't understand is that any message that you send to me is my property, not yours. It really doesn't matter how private you wish it to be, when I receive it, it becomes my property to do with as I will. If you are embarrassed (as you should be), then think before you act (I know that will be unusual for you - you don't actually think). Any PMs that you send to me in the future may be posted back to the board. If you can't actually hold up your end of a debate in public, what good does it do to PM your conqueror and claim victory?\n\n \n Now that you've made public this fact, I must now say that I spoke to you in private in order to forestall you going on over an issue of which you are wrong. Darwin's words are exact.\n \n \nSo the question is, what books/papers of Darwin have you read? If you haven't read any, then you aren't a Christian since you implied that you had. That would be a lie.\n\n \n You make an 'absolute' argument that I've read nothing by Darwin. The very fact I've posted quotes from Darwin's works suggest that I've read something of his. I think you continue to make sweeping-statements and opinion as fact out of anger.\n \n \n Do Christian's lie?\n\n \n I see many things in this question. One is a hate for Christians. But yes, Christians do lie. Do you admit to mistakes? No. I'd like to remind you about your attack on me earlier where you said I had no idea about who coined the words \"Survival of the Fittest\". You let your ego get in the way.\n \n \nBut I didn't defend \"survival of the fittest.\" You did. Modern scientists don't use it because it doesn't adequately describe the modern theory. In fact, it didn't adequately describe Darwin's original theory.\n \n Why do you lack the courage to defend your position, and when shown to be wrong, admit your error. Have you no moral integrity?\n \n Darwin yielded to popular opinion. For some reason, 'survival of the fittest', even though it was strictly an economic theory, became attached to Darwin's theory of natural selection. Spencer read Darwin and saw some application to his own area of expertise. He realized that uneconomical businesses would ultimately fail. Thus, the economically fit would survive.\n\n \n You are the one that defended \"Survival of the Fittest\" by making every apologetic claim you could to get Darwin off the hook,\n a) that someone else coined it\n b) i) that someone else persuaded him to use it\n ii) that popular pressure persuaded him to use it\n c) that he always used this tautology in line with something else, but then, no he didn't he used them in conjunction\n d) that it's now not used anyway\n \n How am I wrong? I stated Darwin equates the two. I post a link to showing this. I state Darwin thought that a tautology was a better way of describing his theory of Natural Selection.\n \n \nBut that isn't Darwinism or evolutionary theory. How sad that Monty doesn't know that. He wants to link Darwinism to Hitler while he ignores the Hitler-Christianity link. I see both as travesties. Monty defends Hitler's Christianity. How terribly sad.\n\n \n There is a clear relationship between \"Survival of the Fittest\" and Nazi ideaolgoy. Hitler continually talked of the struggle of races, and the need of one to dominate the others. If you can find a link between the teachings of Christ, and Nazi ideology, now is the time to present it\n \n \nMonty seems to me to be a neo-Nazi.\n\n \n More offensive attacks.\n \n Quoted from post 162 This was however, originally posted by Ungerdunn.\n \n On our theory the continued existence of lowly organisms offers no difficulty; for natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, does not necessarily include progressive development- it only takes advantage of such variations as arise and are beneficial to each creature under its complex relations of life.\n \n \"I should premise that I use this term in a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another, and including (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny. Two canine animals, in a time of dearth, may be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live. But a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the drought, though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture. A plant which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which only one of an average comes to maturity, may be more truly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe the ground. The mistletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle with these trees, for, if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree, it languishes and dies. But several seedling mistletoes, growing close together on the same branch, may more truly be said to struggle with each other. As the mistletoe is disseminated by birds, its existence depends on them; and it may metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in tempting the birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds. In these several senses, which pass into each other, I use for convenience sake the general term of Struggle for Existence.\"\n http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species-6th-edition/chapter-03.html",

   "[QUOTE=Close_slave_can]I do not agree with ungerdunn calling you montypoo. You can call me closeypoo if it helps.\n \n I would not wish to call you that. But he evolved my username from Montalban to Montyp** to just p** and that has, in common usage, at least here in Australia the equivalent of the word excrement. I found that most upsetting, especially as he was tying this up with a general insult on my ability to understand English. This word is used (from the two references I used) only as a derogatory term (even when it doesn't refer to said foul substance). I will not dwell on this any more suffice to say one thing, that writer had previously clashed with me under a different username. He referred to an incident that gave me the clue - the only thing I don't know is which poster he was before; Lurch, or SLP, or Iamthetruth or another equally vulgar poster.\n \n It is now a dead issue, but I thank you for your input.\n \n \nAlso a gene that has a lower chance of getting passed than other will eventually vanish. I have seen Creationist websites agree with this idea. they describe it as a loss of information which many find annoying but the point is that you are the first I have seen that disagrees that genes that are unlikely to get passed on become rarer and rarer as time passes.\n\n \n I have also seen Creationist web-sites that agree with speciation. They say that the rapid change in species variation within a type undermines the old earth model, because when change happens, it happens fast. I don't agree with this, as I have mentioned. I'm not a creationist... in the sense that it is used to describe those who attempt to use science to understand and support creation; tied into this is also the fact most of these seem to be Protestant. (I am a creationist only in the sense that I believe in the Orthodox teachings on creation).\n \n Yes, I see that in theory some genes will vanish. But the circumstances in which one set is passed on over another, has nothing to do with fitness. It is blind luck that a species survives; that the big lion passes on the right genes at the right time, when a weaker lion might have had better genes for surviving a particular set of circumstances. I suppose this is why evolutionists account for extinction, that circumstances swiftly change and that the wrong males are mating with the females - that there might be members of the species with the right set of genes that would enable species survival, so here also is an example that the biggest male mating is not an example of being 'fit', other than its ability to mate.\n \n What about if the weak lion is born with a mutation that would make it's offspring better suited to survival? The fact that his genes do vanish from the line, is luck, his missing of the chance to mate. It is sheer luck that the right lion with the right genes is able to mate and pass on his genes. There is nothing inherently 'more fit' in a big lion other than at a particular point in it's life, it is more able to mate. That is all it seems to me; the biggest lion mates, and by that we deem it most suitable because it has succeeded in mating, and passing on its genes. I suppose one would then hope that being the biggest at a particular time, it might have the genetic material that makes survival possible in changed circumstances.\n \n Also, I think the idea of the turtles getting to the water when they are born is a good example. Nothing but luck determines which ones the gulls pick out. The gulls don't seem to be going about only weeding out the weakest, they instead take whichever turtle is closer.\n \n (PS, although I don't believe in luck, I use it to express something that is just as likely to me as the equally unlikely event of 'Natural Selection')\n \n If I seem to have waffled, or contradicted myself, I'm sure someone will easily find it; I am still a bit rattled.\n \n \n I also want to take off from where I left. You need not respond if you feel it's not an area of interest to you. And yes, it will seem repetitive; because I was trying to get a stream of argument before several interjections.\n \n I had tried to show that Nazis used Darwinism. Whether they used or misused it, is dependent upon one's morality. They applied the central theme of Darwin's idea \"Survival of the Fittest\".\n \n Darwin himself preferred this tautology to \"Natural Selection\"\n He says in the 6th ed. of \"Origin of the Species\"\n I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term natural selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.  But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.

However, one poster was adamant that I am wrong in this interpretation and whilst he didn't offer any alternative interpretation (rather, insisting on calling me stupid), I would appreciate any genuine posts to set me correct. I am open to suggestion, but from my understanding of what he said, I am right in suggesting that Darwin used a tautology in preference to his term \"Natural Selection\".\n \n My reason for raising this was to tie in that Nazi science is just a scientific as our notions of science, which should rightly be termed \"Western Capitalist Science\". I seem to have failed to properly express my ideas regarding science; owing to the lack of acceptance from the readers out there. But I see our science as one of many applications of science, and we tend to mistake it as just 'science', that is, in terminology familiar with sociologist, we've made it Normative.",

   "Montalban, you do have a misconception, but it's a common one, so don't feel too bad. :)\n \n \"Survival of the fittest\" does not necessarily mean the biggest, strongest, and fastest, as alot of people tend to think it does. \"The fittest\", in this case, just means best able to survive and reproduce. So in your example, if the weaker lion did have genes which gave him an advantage over the other lions in a given set of circumstances, he would be the fittest, in those circomstances.\n \n Let me give a more concrete example. Let's say our small lion has a genetic tendancy to eat bugs. In normal circumstances this wouldn't be an advantage, and his small size would weigh against him, so he'd be unlikely to reproduce. However, lets say that we have an extended drought. Prey animals become scarce, and the large lions start to starve. The small lion, however, needs less food, and can get by on bugs, which have survived the drought. Bingo, he gets to breed, and next generation we get smaller, bug eating lions. (This is oversimplified, of course)\n \n Is \"survival of the fittest\" a tautology? Perhaps. But if so, it's an important one. Sometimes when you present an idea you have to state some really obvious things just so that you can connect the dots. You have to say \"individuals that are most suited to their enviroment are most likely to survive\" to then say \"and so most likely to pass those survival traits to the next generation\"\n \n As for the Nazis, I admit I didn't follow that debate too closely, so here are some thoughts which may or may not have been mentioned before. If the Nazis went around citing Darwin, they almost certainly were doing so incorrectly. I suspect they \"defined\" themselves as \"fittest\" as justification for their genocide.

Darwin used the term natural selection. Darwin used the term natural selection without using the phrase \"survival of the fittest.\" He did so even after the publication of the 4th edition. Darwin preferred the term \"natural selection.\" In fact, Darwin wrote to Wallace in 1866, \"It is, however, a great objection to this term [survival of the fittest] that it cannot be used as a substantive governing a verb; and that this is a real objection I infer from H. Spencer continually using the words, natural selection. I formerly thought, probably in an exaggerated degree, that it was a great advantage to bring into connection natural and artificial selection; this indeed led me to use a term in common, and I still think it some advantage.\" - Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, Volume II\n \n I know that that quote will cause you some problems since Darwin discusses some English gramatical concepts.\n \n Moreover, Darwin never used the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" without reference to natural selection. If he preferred the latter, why did he never give up use of the former?

The term was being used quite commonly by others and to avoid confusion, Darwin began using the phrase in conjuction (not instead of) his preferred term.\n \n Neither does the term \"natural selection\" explain the theory. It is also merely a label used to identify the theory. However, even though analysis of \"survival of the fittest\" yields a tautology, \"natural selection\" doesn't. Possibly you have learned what the word tautology means by this time. You avoided answering when I asked you to support your claim that the term \"natural selection\" is a tautology.

And you return to one single quote, over and over again without bothering to read the whole book to find out what Darwin really meant.\n\n \n Yes you continue to say that I'm incapable of understanding this, or English, and it show you are willing to point score with personal attacks. And, rather then do this privately, believe that making these vulgarities known publicly adds some kind of credence. Your mantra is to continually berate me by questioning my ability to understand English. I have asked you in the past already to point out what you think he means, and instead you just repeat that I won't understand. So it becomes a mantra for you, and gets you out of actually coming up with ideas. Your intent then is just to point score.\n \n \nI think that much of the problem is your inability to grasp simple grammar. You think that labels are explanations, not to mention your inability to distinguish adjectives from nouns.\n\n \n Yes, this doesn't add to the debate a bit either. You've said this already which is how I know you've been here before under a different username. I asked you which one, and you won't say. If I don't answer a question of yours, you claim it is because I'm embarrassed or ashamed etc. I do not make the same claim of you, but it speaks for yourself, in context of what you would say. Obviously you prefer to live by different standards of honesty for yourself.\n \n \nAgain we see how Monty misrepresents what was said. I am sure that he is making a reference to me when he claims that \"one poster called me stupid.\" I certainly didn't and I didn't see anyone do that.\n\n \n I think that when you suggest that I don't understand English, then that equates to calling someone stupid.\n \n Further, I think that when you use a derogatory term instead of my username, and then claim that you've not been abusive, and instead insist I don't understand English, then you just heap abuse upon abuse.\n \n \nAnd Monty, you put yourself in a very strange moral position. When you first made your statement about Darwin's use of the phrase, \"survival of the fittest,\" I pointed out to you that the phrase wasn't Darwin's but was coined by Herbert Spencer and that Darwin didn't use it until the 4th edition of 'Origin'. Your reply was to claim that I had stated that Darwin never used the phrase. If you knew the history, then wouldn't you have been aware that I was correct and said so? Now you suddenly claim to have known this information all along. If you did, then was your statement that I claimed that Darwin never used it an intentional lie? If you didn't know, then isn't your statement that you knew it an intentional lie?\n\n \n This is not what I said. I said that you had claimed he had never used the phrase.\n \n I knew he had used it; my attack was on you whom I believe claimed he never had. \n \n I knew who coined it.\n \n I was wrong to suggest that you said this of Darwin, and you were wrong to claim that you taught me about Spencer coining the phrase. I have conceded where I was wrong, you don't do the same, even here, you try another twist and raising the spectre of me lying. I put this to rest some time ago, apologising for my mistake. I even am glad to mention it here.\n \n Instead of admitting to your mistaken claim about teaching me a lesson, you just repeat this same mud-smear later on.. admittedly, with slightly less conviction.\n \n \nThis must again be your problem in understanding language.\n\n \n Your mantra.\n \n \nDarwin used the term natural selection. Darwin used the term natural selection without using the phrase \"survival of the fittest.\" He did so even after the publication of the 4th edition. Darwin preferred the term \"natural selection.\" In fact, Darwin wrote to Wallace in 1866, \"It is, however, a great objection to this term [survival of the fittest] that it cannot be used as a substantive governing a verb; and that this is a real objection I infer from H. Spencer continually using the words, natural selection. I formerly thought, probably in an exaggerated degree, that it was a great advantage to bring into connection natural and artificial selection; this indeed led me to use a term in common, and I still think it some advantage.\" - Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, Volume II\n\n \n This doesn't say what you want it to say. It says that he only wishes that the term can't be used as a substantiative governing a verb. That is his objection, it is one of its limitations by grammar. He goes on to say that the term 'Natural Selection' is weak, and wishes that he had been urged to use \"Survival of the Fittest\" two months earlier, which is before he published his next edition of Origins!! (see http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin/texts/letters/letters2_04.html) which is why by the time of the 6th edition, he prefers the term \"Survival of the Fittest\" over \"Natural Selection\" (see quote below)\n \n \nI know that that quote will cause you some problems since Darwin discusses some English grammatical concepts.\n\n \n mantra\n \n \nMoreover, Darwin never used the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" without reference to natural selection. If he preferred the latter, why did he never give up use of the former? \n\n \n Why should he have? I don't understand what point, if any, you are trying to make. He said he called his theory \"Natural Selection OR Survival of the Fittest\".\n \n [QUOTE=ungerdunn]And now, since I pointed out to you that the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" is a tautology, you seem to have fixated on that. You have done that before when I have taught you something new.\n \n Are you going to claim that you've taught me something new AGAIN? What is it this time? I knew it was a tautology before, so it can't be that.\n \n \nI'll attempt to explain to you once more in hopes that you will grasp the concepts. \"Survival of the fittest\" is not an explanation of a theory - it is a label - it is a name attached to a complex theory for identification. The term was being used quite commonly by others and to avoid confusion, Darwin began using the phrase in conjunction (not instead of) his preferred term.\n\n \n You argued that they weren't always used in conjunction, but that they were 'linked' as if that was different.\n Post 143\n \nBut they aren't synonyms. They aren't always used in conjunction. I pointed out to you that evolutionary biologists don't use the phrase. You are easily confused. Darwin used the phrase because it had come into common use, but he always linked it to his term, natural selection which he explained in great detail..\n\n \n \nNeither does the term \"natural selection\" explain the theory. It is also merely a label used to identify the theory. However, even though analysis of \"survival of the fittest\" yields a tautology, \"natural selection\" doesn't..\n\n \n Yet you don't explain what you think it means. Simply going back to your mantra of \"you don't understand\". It's a very easy position for you to take...\n \n \nPossibly you have learned what the word tautology means by this time..\n\n \n mantra\n \n \nYou avoided answering when I asked you to support your claim that the term \"natural selection\" is a tautology. If you were referring to the theory itself, then how would you know since you haven't read the theory?.\n\n \n Darwin himself preferred this tautology to \"Natural Selection\"\n He says in the 6th ed. of \"Origin of the Species\"\n I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term natural selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.\n http://www.literature.org/authors/d...chapter-03.html\n \n It is clear. Darwin says, in effect \"I call my theory \"Natural Selection\" BUT \"Survival of the Species\" is a better way of putting it. He prefers a tautology to Natural Selection, and he always uses it in conjunction (according to you), he makes them synonymous, making them equivalent in connotation.\n \n \nWhy don't you PM me and declare victory again? It is such a nice touch and not at all juvenile and childish..\n\n \n I tried to tell you by PM that you are wrong. Instead not only do you violate the 'private' notion, but you call this being childish. Instead, you'd prefer to name call me in public! I do believe that is childish.\n \n You've tried every argument under the sun to apologise for Darwin's stated preference for a tautological phrase, blaming everyone but Darwin (Spencer, Wallace, the general populace for making it popular)\n \n The you've argued that the phrases were always used in conjunction, but then they weren't they were just linked, but then recanted and said they were used in conjunction, when this change actually meant nothing because you used one term, and replaced it with one meaning much the same thing; pretty much what Darwin did.\n \n You claim that Darwin criticised the term, he did, but only for it's limit of application in grammar. He liked the term so much he said to Wallace he wished he'd been convinced earlier, in time to make his publication deadline. Then he claimed unequivocally in his 6th ed that it was a better term.\n \n Although you feel fit to make much of my recalcitrance in answering a question, you see no reason to answer my question regarding your previous identity.\n \n Interspersed in this argument of yours are mud-slinging and point scoring attempts, and use of derogatory language. Further to that you don't believe that a Private Message should remain just that! Despite this lack of respect from you, I have no anger towards you.",

   "A weaker lion might have the genes that are more vital for the species to survive; having some that enable the species to better survive drought, BUT the biggest lion mates. Thus 'fitness\" is indeed only the ability to produce. There is no selection here at all. Big wins, unless the weak lion gets lucky, literally. That is why it is a tautology, because it is so meaningless, that which survives, survives!\n\n \n Did you read my example? If the big lion is weak from hunger, or dead from hunger, than it doesn't mate. The small, bug eating lion mates. That's the whole point, which you seem to be missing. If the smaller lion is better able to survive a drought than the big lion, than it will be more likely to mate, because the big lion is dead. \n \n Under current conditions, specifically for lions, size is a prime survival factor. But it won't always be that way. As climates change and teritories get destroyed it could well be that large size becomes detrimental, at which point being big will be selected against. \n \n Let me give another example, which has actually occurred. It used to be the case that large tusks on elephants were selected for. Apparently, for lady elephants size does matter, and the bull elephants with larger tusks would mate more. Than came hunters. People wanted tusks as trophies, the larger the better. As a result, elephants with large tusks were preferentially killed, while those with smaller tusks got to live long enough to breed. As a result, the average tusk size for elephants has shrunk. The definition of fittest changed due to enviromental changes, and thus the gene pool changed. \n \n And yes, you're right. This isn't any sort of deep logic here. It's not meaningless, it's just really, really straight forward. That's why it's so frustrating when people say they don't buy it.

Populations and species with very little variation are more likely to go extinct. So, if eugenics were to be applied on a world-wide scale, which would end up eliminating a lot of variation in the human species, then the human race would be more likely to go extinct.\n \n Is this the sort of answer you were looking for?",

When Darwin says it was a better phrase, you say no he didn't say that. Then when you claim he 'objected' to the phrase in a letter to Wallace, he did, but not the way you think, because he quite clearly says that he wishes he's been convinced two months prior to use it.\n \n You are arguing from the complete opposite of what Darwin says, and you insist that there's some hidden meaning or gnosis you possess that simply explains away this - that you gained in reading the whole work.

The only thing you've done is;\n \n a) claimed I wouldn't be able to understand it as I'm incapable of understanding basic English\n b) claimed you've already done this (but won't refer to any post reference of it)\n c) used a quote from a letter to Wallace which doesn't support what you contend.\n I think you've had about four days or so now to post your interpretation.\n \n \nYour claim that I called you stupid is an example.

Please posit your alternate theory showing that in fact that this is some act of kindness that I've taken out of context. Maybe I am too stupid to understand this, but I've always understood that when people tell me that I'm incapable of understanding something that is simple, I generally take this as an insult.\n \n \nNo. You failure to grasp the meaning of basic English leads you to believe that disagreement with you is somehow derogatory. It isn't.\n\n \n The word you used has, as far as I know, only derogatory connotations. How is reaping this claim about my inability to grasp English not insulting? Is it less insulting if you continually repeat this claim again and again?\n \n \nBut I didn't post the private message. I just mentioned that you had sent me one.\n\n \n You didn't post it. I did; regardless, it was private; do you have another interpretation of the word 'private'?. You stated what you believed I had said; you didn't just mention that I'd sent one.\n \n \nAnd no, I don't think that your private insults should remain private. We have to tolerate your constant whining about how you are being attacked when someone points out your errors, and yet your insults are supposed to be private.\n\n \n I told you you were wrong. You believe that this is insulting. If so, please tell me what I said that you found insulting, and if I did insult you, I would apologise. You've had ample time to air this grievance too! Instead you just rant about having taught me a number of things.\n \n You also refuse to answer the question as to what username you previously posted as on this forum.\n \n As to earning respect...\n \nYes you do. But respect is earned and I have shown you even more than you deserve.\n\n \n Respect is given to all humans. Although I may upset people, I hope not to have insulted them. And I apologise for my mistakes. You have shown yourself incapable of sorrow. Even your claim that you 'taught' me about Wallace coining the phrase was shown to be wrong. Instead of taking this on board and admitting that you were wrong, you began abusive angry posts which have no point to this forum.\n \n What does, is that Darwin quite clearly liked the tautology so much he stated that he preferred it. He stated that he only wished he'd known about it earlier. It matters not that someone else coined it, or that Wallace convinced him to use it, or it had entered into popular language. Even another poster pointed out that Darwin was wrong to use it. He was. Your continual attempts at defending a phrase everyone else seems to have thrown on the scrap-heap is quite odd.\n \n As for my ability to understand English, I don't understand this... \n You say that the terms are used in conjunction\n \n \nI'll attempt to explain to you once more in hopes that you will grasp the concepts. \"Survival of the fittest\" is not an explanation of a theory - it is a label - it is a name attached to a complex theory for identification. The term was being used quite commonly by others and to avoid confusion, Darwin began using the phrase in conjunction (not instead of) his preferred term.\n\n \n But at Post 143 they aren't, they are 'linked'\n \nBut they aren't synonyms.

But it won't always be that way. As climates change and territories get destroyed it could well be that large size becomes detrimental, at which point being big will be selected against. \n\n \n That's not the point. The point is that the smaller lion might have the mutations that potentially could better the lion race, but it can never pass on this 'fitness' because 'fitness' simply is mating... in this case. It would only be a lucky chance that the big lion died, enabling the smaller lion to mate. Alternatively, the bigger lion might have had the 'better' genes and died of hunger, allowing the 'less suitable' smaller lion to mate. Fitness is simply he who can mate.\n \n There is no other criteria that I see, in these examples. There is nothing 'selective' of nature, anyway, in that nature seems to be blind. And some species are just lucky enough to have the right genetic make-up at the tight time.\n \n \n Let me give another example, which has actually occurred. It used to be the case that large tusks on elephants were selected for. Apparently, for lady elephants size does matter, and the bull elephants with larger tusks would mate more. Than came hunters. People wanted tusks as trophies, the larger the better. As a result, elephants with large tusks were preferentially killed, while those with smaller tusks got to live long enough to breed. As a result, the average tusk size for elephants has shrunk. The definition of fittest changed due to environmental changes, and thus the gene pool changed. \n\n \n How is this an example of natural selection?\n \n \nAnd yes, you're right. This isn't any sort of deep logic here. It's not meaningless, it's just really, really straight forward. That's why it's so frustrating when people say they don't buy it. Evolutionary theory is just a small collection of common sense observations, which people agree with one at a time, but refuse to except the implication of as a whole.\n\n \n I refuse to accept the implications as a whole as they fly in the face of the truth as my God taught us.\n \n \nWell, if evolution theory teaches us anything, it is that the more variation that exists in a population or species, the more likely it will be able to adapt as the environment changes. Populations and species with very little variation are more likely to go extinct. So, if eugenics were to be applied on a world-wide scale, which would end up eliminating a lot of variation in the human species, then the human race would be more likely to go extinct.\n\n \n By this argument we should be halting those that fight genetic disease! Who knows, maybe one of these 'mutants' might hold the key for our future species survival. The Nazis believed that \"Survival of the Fittest\" was the natural state of nature; that if you don't survive against all competition, then you lose. They actually believed that 'lesser races' were harmful to man's survival as a whole. They would have equated these people as genetic disorders, and thus eliminated them.\n \n Who is to judge that all current mutations/variations might not all be harmful?\n \n \nIs this the sort of answer you were looking for?\n\n \n No. I was looking for his reasons. But I still welcome your input as it's always interesting. You have attempted to use a scientific reason, which is not what I expect everyone who looks at this would do.",

Capitalists view nature as competitive, whereas these Marxist critics tend to view it as being much more cooperative.\"\n http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/hull_sociobiology.html\n \n Although I recognise in this, both schools believe in evolution, I also know that there are many more forms of evolution that 'the Theory of Evolution' which you take as normative, including; devolutionary models, ones with intelligent design, including (or not, depending upon your views), panspermia. There's special creation models etc. Then there are old world creationists, new world creationists etc, each with their own parcels of scientific proofs battling against you guys. There's no clear distinction here. There's not 'one truth that is evolution' vs. religious mumbo-jumbo.\n \n As for proofs of natural selection; I've seen some that are cases of artificial selection, posted on this thread. I've even read them in text-books;\n \n \"From time to time, attacks on neo-Darwinism are mounted, usually by persons who either see evolutionary theory as antireligious or who basically misunderstand Darwin's theory. One attack, entitled \"Darwin's Mistakes,\" by Tom Bethell, was published in Harper's magazine.\n \n Bethell began by pointing out that Darwinian theory is a tautology rather than a predicative theory. (The term tautology means a statement that is true by definition.)* That is, evolution is the survival of the fittest. But who are the fittest? Obviously, the individuals who survive. Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival, we are left with the statement that evolution is the survival of the survivors. This indeed is a tautology. But it is possible to assign independent criteria for fitness. Darwin wrote extensively about artificial selection in pigeons, in which the breeders' choice was the criterion for fitness. (Many novel breeds of pigeon have been created this way.) Artificial selection has been practiced extensively by plant and animal breeders. Here too, survival is not the criterion for fitness, productivity is.\"\n Robert H Tamarin, (1996) \"Principles of Genetics\" (5th ed), p571.\n \n People just accept these things because of a world-view (I know I have a priori assumptions too). I just spent days arguing with one person about Darwin's use of the term \"Survival of the Fittest\" because he couldn't cope with the notion that Darwin, the great man himself, would actually prefer a tautology to describe his theory.\n \n There's courses you can take into the many faces of science...One asks...\n \"How has sexist (racist, classist) bias influenced the practice, results, and political uses of science? To what extent is scientific inquiry and, by extension scientific knowledge, objective, rational, reliable? Is science primarily a social activity? How might a feminist political agenda change, improve scientific inquiry, knowledge, and practice?\"\n \n http://www.haverford.edu/femgenstudies/Brokes.html and includes for reading Belk, C.M. 2000. \"Gender bias in biological theory formation. In: Women Succeeding in the Sciences: Theories and Practices across Disciplines\" (Jody Bart, ed.), Purdue University Press, West Lafayette, IN, pp. 169-175.\n \n ? Even before the time of it's formal introduction to science by Darwin, there have been many differing and different theories advanced to explain the fact of organic evolution and the diversity of life on Earth. Some are over 100 years old, while others are quite recent innovations. Some have been discarded as erroneous, while others have, literally and figuratively, tons of evidence which support them. \n \n A general listing of these theories include Darwinism (descent with modification by natural selection; and in and of itself a set of theories; i.e., 'Strict Darwinism', 'General Darwinism', etc.; and an 'umbrella' term sometimes used in other evolutionary theories as a basis, which is then modified), Lamarckianism (\"inheritance of acquired characteristics\"), saltationalism (evolution proceeding by major leaps or jumps), gradualism (slow, uniform accumulation of modifications), punctuated equilib rium (periods of stasis followed by brief, intense periods of speciation), phyletic gradualism (speciation occurs gradually over a species' entire range), orthogenesis (evolution that follows a single direction or specific trend continuously, \"straight- line\" evolution, often appearing to be independent of natural selection), creationism (a religious, non-scientific, pseudoscientific preconceived dogmatic construct), etc.?\n http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/factfaq.htm\n \n \nSo many people make this argument and need to reflect themselves on why they too, are here. Or do you suppose that if I argued for a while, suddenly you'd throw out evolutionary theory? I doubt it, but in your own mind you'd probably say 'sure, if he could provide enough evidence - because this will never happen' \n\n \n \nBouncing the question back at me doesn't count as answering it.\n\n \n It wasn't meant to be an evasion, I'd already stated the absoluteness of God being truth.\n \n \nBut, to show I'm a good sport, I'll answer first. Yes, if anyone could present a good argument why evolution was wrong, I'd accept it, or at the very least doubt evolution. There was a half day where I started to lean towards intelligent design before I figured out the flaw in someone's math. So yes, I can honestly say that if you presented a good argument I would buy it, because it's already happened.\n Now what about you? If you would be so kind, please give me your answer.\n\n \n I did give you the answer. God is the truth. I guess you think that it's the same truth as your truth. It's not a relativist truth. I can't say \"God is the truth, until another truth comes along\" because that's not what I see the 'truth' is. You mistake your idea of the truth for truth. God is. He says He 'is'.\n \n \nAny argument based on logic alone would fail due to the application of Godel's Theorem \n\n \n \nGodel's Theorem states that in any logical system, there will exist unprovable truths, not that the truth is unprovable. Godel doesn't apply here at all.\n\n \n Godel's Incompleteness Theorem (1931): Given any advanced mathematical system, there are always statements which are true but can not be proven true within that mathematical system.'\n http://home.earthlink.net/~csvaughen/godel/godel.html\n \n \"What G\u00f6del and Turing showed is that axiomatic formal reasoning has certain limitations\"\n http://www.cs.umaine.edu/~chaitin/cmu.html\n \n It means that there are maths truths not applicable by using maths. One such as 'God exists', can't be proven using logic and maths alone. Which is why I find it extraordinary then that people would place science up on a pedestal as their ultimate source or rule for truths. Any ultimate test for truth then, can't be reliant on science, which people admit can't ultimately prove anything. So, when you pit your scientific proofs against God's truth, you are in fact pitting a flawed limited interpretation against an absolute truth.\n \n Thus in the end no matter how many 'proofs' you present, they aren't of their nature absolute. Pitting a relativist temporary 'truth' against an absolute 'truth' is no comparison. Besides, what is now true for you, in regards to science may not be tomorrow. You yourself see that it's possible your truth may not be 'true'.\n \n I asked some people who are deistic evolutionists which particular model of evolution did God use. If they believe for instance that science said we evolved through a particular process (say, as described by the Presapiens School), then several years later, when this model is over-turned, they need to re-think how they believe God acted. They are in fact applying human ideas to describe God, and in a sense, although they may not be aware of it, they are trying to limit God's miraculous gifts into human terms.\n \n If this offends you or anyone else, that I would take such an immutable course, I can't help that; it comes with the passion for God, and the truth. \n `\n I think scientists should stick to coming up with new medicines etc.",

   "This is untrue. It means that a particular maths system (eg arithmetic) cannot be used to prove all truths inherent within that system, another system is required to do this (eg algebra). There will then be truths within algebra that cannot be proven by algebra alone and that require yet another maths system ad infinitum.\n\n \n Yes, to a point you are correct. But you do recognise the problem that you need to go outside a system, and then you'd need to go outside that, and so on and so on, so ultimately, when I said \"It means that there are maths truths not applicable by using maths.\" I believe this to be true...\n \n \"In 1931, the Czech-born mathematician Kurt G\u00f6del demonstrated that within any given branch of mathematics, there would always be some propositions that couldn't be proven either true or false using the rules and axioms ... of that mathematical branch itself. You might be able to prove every conceivable statement about numbers within a system by going outside the system in order to come up with new rules and axioms, but by doing so you'll only create a larger system with its own unprovable statements. The implication is that all logical system of any complexity are, by definition, incomplete; each of them contains, at any given time, more true statements than it can possibly prove according to its own defining set of rules.\"\n http://www.miskatonic.org/godel.html\n \n \nOf course it can't as it's nothing to do with maths.\n\n \n Oops, my mistake\n \n However, logic has something to do with maths. And logic is limited. You can see this by the limitations of logic machines, such as computers. A logic machine, such as in artificial intelligence will be limited because of the implications in Godel's Theorem\n http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/v2/psyche-2-09-chalmers.html is a review of the theory Penrose puts forward, with some interesting insights to the barrier that will be faced by AI - because of the limitations of logic/programming.\n \" Part of Penrose's conviction that his reasoning is intrinsically more powerful than that of a computer program may come from his using kinds of reasoning that he implicitly denies machines. There are two such kinds of reasoning.\"*\n http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/v2/psyche-2-11-mccarthy.html\n \n However, logic is math's like. Within the realm of logic, nothing can therefore be proven.\n \"How can you figure out if you are sane? ... Once you begin to question your own sanity, you get trapped in an ever-tighter vortex of self-fulfilling prophecies, though the process is by no means inevitable. Everyone knows that the insane interpret the world via their own peculiarly consistent logic; how can you tell if your own logic is \"peculiar' or not, given that you have only your own logic to judge itself? I don't see any answer. I am reminded of G\u00f6del's second theorem, which implies that the only versions of formal number theory which assert their own consistency are inconsistent. \n The other metaphorical analogue to G\u00f6del's Theorem which I find provocative suggests that ultimately, we cannot understand our own mind/brains ... Just as we cannot see our faces with our own eyes, is it not inconceivable to expect that we cannot mirror our complete mental structures in the symbols which carry them out? All the limitative theorems of mathematics and the theory of computation suggest that once the ability to represent your own structure has reached a certain critical point, that is the kiss of death: it guarantees that you can never represent yourself totally.\"\n http://www.miskatonic.org/godel.html\n \n \nThe question of the existence of a deity is a philosophical one, not maths. Likewise I cannot use maths to prove \"the cup on my desk exists\", there is nothing special about a deity in this.\n\n \n Yes, then in the long run, maths is useless if it doesn't get you closer to God.\n \n \nThat's because you want a nice safe complete \"truth\" rather than the messy \"we don't really know\" of reality. I find it incomprehensible that people such as you - that stifle their lives just to make it simple - exist.\n\n \n My life is not stifled. God is not simple. That He is, is a simple truth, but knowing Him, journeying to Him is a great joyous mystery. Figuring out maths problems, whilst a mystery, has an ends that is not as fulfilling.\n \n \nThere can be no \"ultimate test for truth\" unless one denies reality.\n\n \n God can't be 'defined' that's the whole point. Reality isn't just what can be described. Sometimes someone can feel a pain that I can't put into words, that science can't test for. However, there is clearly a need for systems beyond science and logic in order to explain things. There is intuition, and we can't deny our emotional and illogical selves as well.\n \n \nYou are entitled to your opinion.\n\n \n Thank you for that! Therein lies the problem with science, people get bogged down in a pursuit for truths, then moving beyond that, then again, then again, caught up with their own smugness in this, and not getting any closer to God.\n \n \" We can produce models and explanations, and they will be illuminating: but, however far they go, there will always remain more to be said. There is no arbitrary bound to scientific enquiry: but no scientific enquiry can ever exhaust the infinite variety of the human mind.\"\n http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/mmg.html\n \n The human mind is superior to science and logic. We also feel things. We can begin to understand God through our 'heart' as well as our head. In Orthodoxy, we call this 'noetic' understanding.",

This belief existed because people could see maggots 'form' on rotting meat. The first serious attack on the idea of spontaneous generation was made in 1668 the Italian physician Francesco Redi. Up till that time, it was widely believed that maggots arose spontaneously in rotting meat. Redi believed that maggots developed from eggs laid by flies. To test his hypothesis, he set out meat in a variety of flasks, some open to the air, some sealed completely, and others covered with gauze. As he had expected, maggots appeared only in the open flasks in which the flies could reach the meat and lay their eggs. \n \n \n \n It was through hypothesis, experimentation and then observation that Redi showed spontaneous generation did not occur. But for many in the anti-God group, we must now reverse this ideal. NOW we must believe that life spontaneously developed from non-life, and all without benefit of observation. Worse still, at least with old theories of spontaneous generation life was believed to have come from organic material, now we are to believe that life came from non-organic material. \n \n \n \n Darwin himself hypothesised a 'primordial soup.'\n \n \n \n \n I can see where that one will go, let me rephrase. You don't say that the universe is wrong, you say that looking at the universe is irrelevant. In other words, \"I've made up my mind, don't confuse me with the facts.\" I've read your posts. You know that the evidence is against you. But when push comes to shove, all your arguments boil down to your assertion that's it's impossible that you picked the wrong religion.\n\n \n \n Nice re-working of my beliefs. All the evidence is not against me. The evidences of testimony of Holy Fathers, and of Jesus are on my side. But yes, I've made up my mind. I don't think 'facts' get in the way, though there are so many that you can have, even within one form of evolutionary theory, mutually exclusive theories.\n \n When I weigh up the unchanging teachings of the Church against those of mere men, I accept the former. When I see the teachings of science continually shifting, then I don't hold it up as my ultimate test for ultimate truth.\n \n I'd be interesting to hear from you if you believe that there is in fact any truth that is ultimately true.\n \n Also, I just realized I've been miss-spelling your username. I must apologise for that.\n \n \n On the other is a cadre of scientists who say that for now we'll say that the earth is 4.5 billion years old, but 20 years ago, they said something else, and 20 years from now, likely they'll say something else yet again, who even when they look to how man evolved will present mutually exclusive theories based on 'objective evidences'.\n\n \n [Quote=OccamsRazor] This statement is illuminating, not because of the facts you discuss (incidently the current value for the AoE is a result of 50 years of ongoing research and expermentation) but for the attitude you reveal.\n \n That research over 50 years - has it always produced the same results through one theory? Or have there been a number of theories with different outcomes? Which one is 'true'? That's right, science can't in the end prove anything anyway. Still, with out any real sense of 'truth' you know I'm wrong! Why, simply because there's a group of people without a sense of 'truth' who know I'm wrong.\n \n \n You see the only possible explanation for the origin of the universe and everything within it as being a literal reading of the story in Genesis.\n\n \n Not exactly, no. I don't literally take a 'literal' account. I take a mystical account of it.\n \n I've already stated this, and see I must re-state it for those like yourself who missed it\n Fr Seraphim Rose said this about Genesis \"Some Protestant fundamentalists tell us it is all (or virtually all) 'literal.\" But such a view places us in some impossible difficulties: quite apart form our literal or non-literal interpretation of various passages, the very nature of the reality which is described in the first chapters of genesis the very creation of all things) makes it quite impossible for everything to be understood 'literally'; we don't even have words, for example, to describe 'literally' how something can come from nothing. How does God \"speak\"? - does He make a noise which resounds in an atmosphere that doesn't yet exist?\" (Genesis Creation and Early Man, p69).\n \n \n \n This is why I've also said I'm not a 'creationist' in the sense that it is oft used now. Western Christians might have legalistic definitions/approaches to the issue. Orthodox don't.\n \n \n \nYou refuse to even entertain any other possibility, be it from another religon, science or belief- the details are irrelevant as all that matters is that your version is absolutely correct.\n\n \n Correct. Truth in this case is not relative. God exists beyond us and for the most part, even beyond our level of comprehension. Even if I come to be in the presences of God, I'll never, because of His nature, know and understand Him fully. It is why we don't try to put into absolute terms our definitions of Him, or the miracles He performs, but we accept Him.\n \n \nWith regard to science this reveals a certain hypocrisy with such a position. You will argue that science is wrong ad nauesum when it has things to say about the history of the universe, but will not bat an eyelid when related science or related scientific principles are used for other purposes.\n\n \n Not true. But we're talking here about evolution.\n \n \nWhy is this? how come you can pick fault with science in one area- i.e.. evolution- and not in others? Oh, and please don't try to separate out the sciences involved in evolution, cosmology and earth history as some sort of special, unique area as they are not.\n\n \n I am against all sciences that conflict with the truth, to the extent that they conflict with the truth.\n \n \nThe very thing you site (sic) as a problem with science- its flexibility- is its underpinning strength! Off course outlooks can change- but this is in the face of new evidence, experimentation and so forth. If you think this is a bad or undesirable thing you are holding a truely blinkered view of the world we live in.\n\n \n I tell you here that I've no real problem with science per se. I recognise that it shifts and changes. That's fine. It produces versions DOS that sometimes works, etc. It is however, when this constant shifting version of the truth is put up against 'the TRUTH' that is God, then I find it odd. You here recognise that science always changes. So, oddly enough you compare a shifting truth to a claim of absolute truth. And you're astounded that anyone can be certain! Yet, with absolute certainty you are certain that I can't be, or shouldn't be.\n \n \nI find many of the tenets of YE- Creationism astounding, but this one particularly so.\n\n \n Cool! It's nice to feel loved.",

That might be a false reality, or maybe it's just 'practical'\n \n I recall reading somewhere in \"Chaos\" by Gleick his argument that one can't really know the surface area of a table. For practical purposes we measure length and width, and multiply these. However, in reality if we look at the surface area there's lots of little bumps and undulations. We should take this into account, and the closer and more detailed look, the more irregularities we observe, each of course affecting the actual surface area computation.\n We keep looking and looking and eventually find massive spaces between atoms etc.\n But for all practical purposes, I know when I set my can of Dr. Pepper down, it's not going to fall through these spaces.\n \n Another example from the same book...\n Take for example, you're working in a lab, and you want to describe a newly discovered bacteria. You look into the microscope, you see the little bugs moving around in an 'agitated' manner. You publish your findings. Months later other labs around the world read your work. There is some doubt. Other scientists have samples of the bug. Each conducts their own observations under similar conditions, and lo! they agree with your description. Your paper then enters the main-stream of thought as a 'truth' concerning an aspect of this bug. \n \n BUT WAIT... it's not as simple as that. To observe the bacteria, you used a microscope. You used light shining up on a little mirror so you could see the bugs. The bugs may have reacted to the unwanted concentration of light. What you described as how they acted, was only how they acted while you were observing them! \n \n He suggests that you can't know what is 'true' because you need to observe, but your observation affects the outcome. So how do you ever know it's true state? (You could add that you could view the bug under a particular camera apparatus - but there's always the possibility it too is changing how they behave).",

Also, it's why when 'sexism' predominate society more than now, evolutionary evidence appeared to back this up...\n Darwin postulated that females are ''coy,'' mating rarely and choosing their mates carefully, presumably betting their odds on the males with the best genes to contribute to their offspring. For their part, males are ''ardent'' and promiscuous, and fight amongst themselves for female partners. Later theories added that males are promiscuous because they have less to lose by making babies - unlike eggs, sperm are plentiful and small. Plus, females usually do most of the work to raise the offspring?\n http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_relea...u-sag021003.php\n \n ?In the mid-nineteenth century, social Darwinists invoked evolutionary biology to argue that a woman was a man whose evolution - both physical and mental - had been arrested in a primitive stage. In this same period, doctors used their authority as scientists to discourage women's attempts to gain access to higher education. Women's intellectual development, it was argued, would proceed only at great cost to reproductive development. As the brain developed, so the logic went, the ovaries shrivel. In the twentieth century, scientists have given modern dress to these prejudices. Arguments for women's different (and inferior) nature have been based on hormonal research, brain lateralization, and sociobiology.?\n Londa Schiebinger, \"History and Philosophy\", in Sex and Scientific Inquiry, eds. Sandra Harding and Jean F. O'Barr, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), p. 26-27.\n Quoted at: http://www.dean.sbc.edu/bart.html\n Feminists claim that evolution, long the domain of men has present biased accounts of science in order to explain gender.\n ?Men's claims to \"know\" women's natures, abilities, limitations, and so forth have been a fundamental element of feminist criticisms since its genesis, primarily because it is precisely these claims which are used to justify the social and political subordination of women.?\n Ibid.\n \n However, now we're more eqaul (though feminists would argue this), we discover we've had evidences to point to another conclusion...\n \"In a popular recounting of the same subject, reporter Sharon Begley wrote in Newsweek (April 21, 1997) that biologists in the 1960s portrayed sperm as active, \"macho adventurers,\" eggs as passive, \"coy damsels.\" According to the article, it was only recently discovered that \"sperm are ineffectual swimmers\" and that \"the egg actively grabbed the sperm.\" Begley acknowledged that by 1964, researchers knew that the early development of the fertilized cell was guided by genetic material of the egg, but she quoted Martin as saying that \"no one knew what to do\" with this research.\n Are these charges of masculinist bias in scientific accounts valid? In a recent (October 1997) debate at the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C., Gross gave a scathing response. He noted that research published as early as 1878 and 1919 clearly described the egg as actively engulfing and pulling in the sperm, and that since then, the egg's role has not been considered passive \"in any scientifically meaningful way.\" And he reaffirmed the scientific observation that sperm do swim.?\n http://members.tripod.com/~ScienceWars/cult.html",

However, we're talking about the nature of the physical universe here, and the best tool for exploring those questions is science. There are many reasons for this, some of which you've mentioned as being weaknesses. For example, science knows its limitations. You say that science can't figure out the ultimate truth. True. Science doesn't even try. It's just concerned with the nature of the physical universe. Truths relating to that its excellent at figuring out. You say that science changes over time. That's a good thing, not a weakness. Everything that we do, whether it be science or religion, is done by people, and people make mistakes. Science recognizes that, and is designed to check for mistakes and adapt when they're discovered. \n \n Basically what I'm saying here is that if we're dealing with a spiritual question, I'll defer to religion for an answer, because religion is the best tool for answering those questions.

Worse still, at least with old theories of spontaneous generation life was believed to have come from organic material, now we are to believe that life came from non-organic material. \n \n Nice re-working of my beliefs. All the evidence is not against me. The evidences of testimony of Holy Fathers, and of Jesus are on my side. But yes, I've made up my mind.

I appologize for the length.\n \n Changing is bad and a sign of weakness. The answers that science provides change (evolve emoticon_ic ) as we learn and gain greater knowledge.

   "\"Science education is built upon a set of theoretical and philosophical beliefs about the nature of science and the nature of learning which are not reliable in practice. \n Science education traditionally defines science as a body of knowledge, beginning with facts, and moving on to concepts and relations, models and theories, processes and activities. Its conception of knowledge is a fundamentally mentalistic and superficially cognitive one. What is known, be it facts or concepts, is said to be known in the \"mind\" (a curiously unscientific place, both immaterial and inaccessible to observation). The processes of science are likewise reduced to imaginary \"mental\" or \"cognitive\" processes, which also occur only in this imaginary domain. Traditional science education argues that the same mind-knowledge and the same mind-processes take place both in the school context and the context of working science, and that it is these which constitute science and these which are being taught. \n This is no longer a credible view, neither of science nor of learning to do science. Science is neither a system of well-understood mental concepts and processes, nor a body of facts, principles, and theories. These are at best the tools, and in some cases, the products of scientific activity. Science is a social subculture: a vast interlocking network of the working activities of producers and users of these products and tools (cf. Latour 1987, 1988). A culture and its activities cannot be known by inference from a study of its products and tools alone, but only by direct knowledge of their actual contexts of production and use.\"\n http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/education/jlemke/papers/gap-sci.htm\n \n \nI'd love to see how these bishops (all of them?) trace their ancestry. I have an uncle that has traced our family back to Scotland in the middle ages, I think all records are lost somewhere in the 1600's. He's spent his life in pursuit of tracing our genealogy including several trips to Scotland to research (and check out our castle :p). To be able to trace anything to 33AD would be QUITE the feat.\n\n \n Any misunderstanding here may be my fault. The bishop's not tracing his personal history back to 33 AD, but his authority and teachings.\n \n I am Antiochian Orthodox. St. Peter, taught by Jesus, in turn founded the church in Antioch. Ignatius of Antioch, one of his more famous pupils, wrote many Epistles. We can test these Epistles against the teachings of Christ and so on to Ignatius' students. Ignatius passed the teachings on, and his student passed them on etc. to the present day. That is Apostolic Succession. I can look to books such as the Didache (written c.120 AD) and see that they celebrated the Eucharist; not a 'special commemorative meal' as some Protestants have; but a celebration in the actual body and blood of Christ.\n \n \nSecondly, \n \n I really don't understand what all of these \"sciences\" mean. I am a \"scientist\" and these concepts are completely foreign to me. You are the only person I have ever heard refer to science as anything but just science. \n\n \n Yes, that's because you were taught a 'science' as science. If you'd been raised in China, you'd have had a different syllabus.\n \n Some people now recognise this and teach 'the nature of science'\n \"Presently, curriculum designers around the world may differ in their views about topics to include in the science curriculum. However, they almost all would include the nature of science in science curriculum (American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1989; Hazen & Trefil, 1991; Lederman, 1992; and Rutherford & Ahlgren, 1990).\"\n http://www.balfakih.net/epistemology.htm\n \n Feminist science claims to be more pluralistic, and more aware of gendered a priori notions . Such gender bias is part of the very language used by scientists, it is inescapable. \"Narrative conventions form part of scientific description. These are forms of words that are typical of a particular thought process. Haraway (1989) uses the tools of literary theory to demonstrate how hypotheses in primatology and evolutionary theory depend on narrative conventions (for example, casting the transition from ape to hominid as a heroic drama) and tropes (for example, casting primates as mirrors of human nature).\"\n \n http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/f...m-epistemology/\n \n This means that in the male-dominated western idea of evolution, male-dominated forms of description are used (conventions) to convey evolutionary theory. What you may believe to be valueless; science, is in fact riddled with values.\n \n \"Most advocates of feminist science argue, in this vein, that scientific inquiries informed by feminist values are based on legitimate, generative limiting biases. They argue not that feminist sciences should exclude other ways of doing science, but that feminist sciences should be included as among the legitimate choices available to investigators.\"\n \n Ibid\n \n Science itself is ?male-orientated and culturally biased.\n \n http://www.cis.vt.edu/sage/journal/ ?The Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering? was created to over-come this.\n \n It is filled with these biases, no matter how ?empirical? the evidence may seem.\n \n One online debater summed it up well. ?Post-modern thinkers have also drawn attention to the fact that what poses as objectivity is often pervaded with bias, and that science can never escape this, no matter how strictly it defines its epistemology??\n \n http://www.directionjournal.com/ale...s/belief01.html\n \n See also http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/s...owledge-social/which has a very good account of the knowledge of science.\n \n Thus Evolution reflects in part the minds of the people interpreting it. This is recognised by feminists who include courses to make people more aware of gender bias in science formation.\n \n One course asks?\n \n ?How has sexist (racist, classist) bias influenced the practice, results, and political uses of science? To what extent is scientific inquiry and, by extension scientific knowledge, objective, rational, reliable? Is science primarily a social activity? How might a feminist political agenda change, improve scientific inquiry, knowledge, and practice??\n \n http://www.haverford.edu/femgenstudies/Brokes.html and includes for reading Belk, C.M. 2000. ?Gender bias in biological theory formation. In: Women Succeeding in the Sciences: Theories and Practices across Disciplines? (Jody Bart, ed.), Purdue University Press, West Lafayette, IN, pp. 169-175.\n \n Two of the objectives of Wisenet are to directly combat this gender bias in scientific learning...\n \n \"to examine the relation between scientific research and technology and promote research and technology more appropriate to world needs; \n to explore programs for change in the sciences and more democratic and participatory systems as an alternative to the male-dominated tradition;\"\n \n http://www.wisenet-australia.org/history.html\n \n \n \n \n Are geologists in China doing \"Marxist geology\" and I'm doing \"capitalist geology\"? Or are Chinese geologists doing \"Chinese geology\" while I'm doing \"Canadian geology\"? What about the guys across the street at Burlington (an American company), are they doing \"American geology\"? \n\n \n \n Essentially this is it. When Chinese anthropologists go a digging, they try to find proofs that man evolved in China. That is because they have a nationalist over-arching belief that they take with them. Hence capitalist anthropologists might well show the 'competition' amongst species helped spur man's evolution.\n \n \nIs the lady in the office down the hall to me doing \"feminist engineering\"? \n Personally I think these labels are pure nonsense, but I'm more than willing to be proven wrong. \n Waxy\n\n \n It is probably true that she's doing the same male-orientated science as you, because she's been trained to do science in that way. Males dominate science, from the predominance of males in top scientific positions, to class-room dynamics.\n Gender inequality is recognised in the classroom...\n http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Dean_of_the_College/homepginfo/equity/Equity_handbook.html\n and later in career...\n see Barriers to Women in Academic Science and Engineering\" at http://www.mills.edu/ACAD_INFO/MCS/SPERTUS/Gender/EKNU.html\n \n I have previously shown quotes from how women were perceived as 'coy' during Darwin's day, to how female traits are now viewed.\n \n These things go on and we are often not aware of it. Scientists carry the same biases as other people. Education itself is a socialising factor in your life. How you are educated helps you in normalising and rationalising things. Marxists would argue that everything you were taught, including science was for conformity within a western male-dominated capitalistic society. It goes to the stabilization of that society, which is why society is, as a rule, generally cohesive.\n \n As a final word, I'll be bowing out of this thread (perhaps for ever - how sad!), because it's too much on my plate to debate this and heaps of other debates, including on other fora.\n \n There's an interesting article defending this deconstruction of science \"Post-modern Deconstruction Of Newtonian Science: A Physical-to-social Transposition Of Causality\"\n He concludes that Maths was captivated by a particular socio-science ethos:\n \"Levitt spoke of the institutionalization of mathematical illiteracy in academia?s humanistic culture (Levitt, 1997:48), the underlying mechanism of which he feels is difficult to discern. It is not, however. The mechanism responsible, broadly speaking, is the objectivist worldview of the mathematical sciences itself (OEC ideology). If the mathematical sciences had not originally been closely intertwined with the objectivist causality of events adopted by mechanists in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, as they indeed were intertwined through Newton?s adoption of OEC ideology in the Principia [essentially dictated in his Preface on the supposedly inescapable linkage between mathematics (geometry) and mechanics]; then the mathematics thereof might instead have been informed by the contrary worldview of SAC?which the university Scholastics of Newton?s time might have gladly embraced had Newton given them the opportunity. And the mathematics of the ?hard-core sciences? then would in this century have flowed freely with little or no restraint, upward from the natural sciences into the social sciences, humanities and liberal arts.\"\n at http://theoryandscience.icaap.org/content/vol002.001/05zaman.html\n \n In conclusion; science is part of the socialising forces that help you conform to a particular society. Most take this as 'normative' and when presented with alternative sciences dismiss these as, at best 'pseudo-science'. Labels need not be applied to your own version of science, because it is science. Although a post-modernist/feminist/Marxist critique will see that it is anyone or all of the following;\n western science\n male-orientated science\n capitalist science\n Even within this one 'science' we tend to call 'Science' there are no truths. Science, by its very nature can never really be certain. Godel's Theorem is at best science showing that it is certain of being uncertain.\n \n What people propose here as facts against my beliefs in God should be recognised within this context. Most people won't accept this argument, because of the fundamental challenges it poses to their assumptions about science. For many, they have vested much of their lives in the belief that 'their' science is science. It is a convenient, but simplistic division.\n \n Science is limited by scientists, who are people just like you and I. Most unaware of the socialising forces in their lives. Science is too, limited to only what is naturalistic. It can't encompass the richness that is human life, but only deal with a small part of it. I do not hold science up to be the ultimate arbiter of truth, because it itself, makes no claim to be that. God makes that claim.\n \n Science is good for explaining why apples don't fall upwards from a tree, and for improving my sound-system. Neither of these things truly are that important.\n \n All this while as science theories rise and fall, Orthodoxy has been teaching the one truth. It doesn't contradict itself. It teaches one truth; one dealing with the most important endeavour a human can ever under-take; a journey to God.\n \n \n \n PS\n I congratulate your female colleague, she went through a lot to get where she is.",

You might be able to prove every conceivable statement about numbers within a system by going outside the system in order to come up with new rules and axioms, but by doing so you'll only create a larger system with its own unprovable statements. The implication is that all logical system of any complexity are, by definition, incomplete; each of them contains, at any given time, more true statements than it can possibly prove according to its own defining set of rules.\"\n http://www.miskatonic.org/godel.html\n The implication is that you can't in the end, know for certain anything in maths, because you need to keep testing anything by a system outside it ad infinitum.\n \n See also those essays that suggest that a purely logical being such as predicted in A.I. will fail BECAUSE of this limitation in testing for truth. (also Post 219)\n You can see this by the limitations of logic machines, such as computers. A logic machine, such as in artificial intelligence will be limited because of the implications in Godel's Theorem\n http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/v2/p...9-chalmers.html is a review of the theory Penrose puts forward, with some interesting insights to the barrier that will be faced by AI - because of the limitations of logic/programming.\n \" Part of Penrose's conviction that his reasoning is intrinsically more powerful than that of a computer program may come from his using kinds of reasoning that he implicitly denies machines. There are two such kinds of reasoning.\"*\n http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/v2/p...1-mccarthy.html\n \n However, logic is math's like. Within the realm of logic, nothing can therefore be proven.\n \"How can you figure out if you are sane? ... Once you begin to question your own sanity, you get trapped in an ever-tighter vortex of self-fulfilling prophecies, though the process is by no means inevitable. Everyone knows that the insane interpret the world via their own peculiarly consistent logic; how can you tell if your own logic is \"peculiar' or not, given that you have only your own logic to judge itself? I don't see any answer. I am reminded of G\u00f6del's second theorem, which implies that the only versions of formal number theory which assert their own consistency are inconsistent. \n The other metaphorical analogue to G\u00f6del's Theorem which I find provocative suggests that ultimately, we cannot understand our own mind/brains ... Just as we cannot see our faces with our own eyes, is it not inconceivable to expect that we cannot mirror our complete mental structures in the symbols which carry them out? All the limitative theorems of mathematics and the theory of computation suggest that once the ability to represent your own structure has reached a certain critical point, that is the kiss of death: it guarantees that you can never represent yourself totally.\"\n http://www.miskatonic.org/godel.html\n \n \" We can produce models and explanations, and they will be illuminating: but, however far they go, there will always remain more to be said.

   "Part 1 of 2 begins\n In past posts I've issued much on Marxist (aka Marxian) science. Here I bring into focus \"Capitalist\" science.\n \n \nLet me emphasize part of what Godel said:\n there would always be some propositions that couldn't be proven...\n \n Some, not all. And the truths that can't be proven are a very esoteric set of self-referential statements. 99.99(alot of nines)% of the statements you come up with in math are verifiable within the system.\n\n \n Nice 'edit', Kronus.\n \"In 1931, the Czech-born mathematician Kurt G\u00f6del demonstrated that within any given branch of mathematics, there would always be some propositions that couldn't be proven either true or false using the rules and axioms ... of that mathematical branch itself. You might be able to prove every conceivable statement about numbers within a system by going outside the system in order to come up with new rules and axioms, but by doing so you'll only create a larger system with its own unprovable statements. The implication is that all logical system of any complexity are, by definition, incomplete; each of them contains, at any given time, more true statements than it can possibly prove according to its own defining set of rules.\"\n http://www.miskatonic.org/godel.html\n Note 'all' of them.\n That is to test a truth of a system in maths, one needs go outside it, but then that system too, can?t ultimately tell the truth, so you need go outside it, and so on and so forth.\n \n Also note the continuation of their quote?\n G\u00f6del's Theorem has been used to argue that a computer can never be as smart as a human being because the extent of its knowledge is limited by a fixed set of axioms, whereas people can discover unexpected truths ... It plays a part in modern linguistic theories, which emphasize the power of language to come up with new ways to express ideas. And it has been taken to imply that you'll never entirely understand yourself, since your mind, like any other closed system, can only be sure of what it knows about itself by relying on what it knows about itself.\n Ibid.\n Logic has its limitations. I also showed this with various hypotheses concerning Artificial Intelligence.\n \n Note also the generalist notions that science can never ultimately know the truth of anything. You seem to believe that Maths is an exception.\n \n \nIf you still don't understand this, I suggest you read G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas R. Hofstadter. It's a wonderful treatment of this subject for the lay person. It's a long book though, so until you get through it, take my word, you have this all wrong.\n\n \n I suspect from your writing style that you've posted here as someone else. Is this true? You sound exactly like Ungerdunn.\n \n \nNow, for you epistemology argument. Most of it is balderdash. I looked at some of the papers you sited, and can only assume you didn't. Indian science, according to the paper you cited, isn't new science, it's just a strategy for modernizing science in India.\n\n \n Yes, nationalist science of India is about the politicization of science for a particular governmental agenda. It says \"Nationalist science policy was state-centred and typically monumentalist\"\n http://www.ljudmila.org/nettime/zkp4/08.htm\n You should be out-raged, because what you believe would be 'science' is subverted by the political imperative of Indian nationalists. Particular science projects would be formulated and executed with this bias in place. It is science driven by politics. It is obvious that there is bias here. It is less obvious to you the extent of bias in your own version of science, because for you, your version is 'normative'.\n \n Likewise, capitalists invest in our version of 'science' making for bias here.\n \"Just as sociobiology was emerging, a quite different view of science was becoming influential. According to this view, scientists make their decisions in large measure influenced by broader social contexts, such as those of economics and class structure\"\n http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/hull_sociobiology.html\n \n \"We live under capitalism, so we have capitalist science. We want to bring a different set of values into being, to bring about a new set of ruling ideas?ideas of a society without rulers, a part of a different ideology or world-view. We want to bring about a socialist society. It will, if we are vigilant, have a socialist science. I can imagine it, or some of it.\" SCIENCE IS SOCIAL RELATIONS at http://www.human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/sisr1.html\n \n \"The major political task is seen as showing the reality of capitalist domination in the apparently neutral science\"\n http://www.human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap100h.html\n A claim that your version of science is fabricated as 'normative' as part of the social-engineering of capitalism.\n \n \" Workers experience capitalist science with racist books like The Bell Curve and the fascist sociobiology of E.O. Wilson. Capitalist science perverts biology and genetics in order to label workers inferior and to claim that it is \"human nature\" to be racist.\n * Even when capitalist science produces useful knowledge, the contradictions of capitalism prevent its application. Millions of children die every year from preventable or treatable infectious diseases. Tobacco and junk food kill people, but capitalists sell more cigarettes than ever and open new McDonalds every day. Engineers know how to make earthquake-resistant buildings, yet as many as 40,000 workers just died in Turkey because capitalists are devoted to building profits, not safe homes.\"\n http://www.plp.org/cd99/cd0915.html#RTFToC19\n \n See also \"How Science is Perverted to Build Fascism: A Marxist Critique of E.O. Wilson's Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge\"\n http://www.worldpoliticalinfo.20m.com/eowilson.htm which is rather radical.\n \n It is capitalist science that drove many scientists to ignore the evidences of cancer from smoking; economic forces were brought to bare for a long time. That we now have general acceptance of the harmfulness of smoking is a triumph against those forces.\n \n However for a moment let's have a brief look at the history of science in regards to smoking...\n 1922: OPINION: \"Is There a Cigarette War Coming?\" in Atlantic magazine says, \"scientific truth\" has found \"that the claims of those who inveigh against tobacco are wholly without foundation has been proved time and again by famous chemists, physicians, toxicologists, physiologists, and experts of every nation and clime.\"\n 1925: OPINION: \"American Mercury\" magazine: \"A dispassionate review of the [scientific] findings compels the conclusion that the cigarette is tobacco in its mildest form, and that tobacco, used moderately by people in normal health, does not appreciably impair either the mental efficiency or the physical condition.\"\n 1938: MEDIA: Consumer Reports rates 36 cigarette brands. \n CR notes that Philip Morris lays \"great stress in their advertising upon their substitution of glycol for glycerin. The aura of science surrounding their 'proofs' that this makes a less irritating smoke, does not convince many toxicologists that they were valid. Of the many irritating combustion products in tobacco smoke, the modification of one has probably little more than a psychological affect in reducing irritation felt by the smoker.\"\n http://www.metromkt.net/viable/health27.shtml\n Note here, the company issued scientific data to back up their claims about the harmless nature of their product. Continuing...\n Knocks \"the obvious bias of cigarette manufacturers, as well as of the 'scientists' whom they directly or indirectly subsidize.\" \n Rates nicotine content, finding: \n Chesterfield: 2.3 mg nicotine \n Marlboro: 2.3 mg nicotine \n Philip Morris: 2.2 mg nicotine \n Old Gold: 2.0 mg nicotine \n Camel: 1.9 mg nicotine \n Lucky Strike: 1.4 mg nicotine\n 1946: A letter from a Lorillard chemist to its manufacturing committee states: \"Certain scientists and medical authorities have claimed for many years that the use of tobacco contributes to cancer development in susceptible people. Just enough evidence has been presented to justify the possibility of such a presumption.\" (Maryland \"Medicaid\" Lawsuit 5/1/96)\n 1973: SCIENCE: RJR report on success of PM's Marlboro and B&W's Kool brands states, \"A cigarette is a system for delivery of nicotine to the smoker in attractive, useful form. At normal smoke pH, at or below 6.0, the smoke nicotine is...slowly absorbed by the smoker. . . As the smoke pH increases above about 6.0, an increasing portion of the total smoke nicotine occurs in free form, which is rapidly absorbed by the smoker and...instantly perceived as a nicotine kick.\"\n 1973-07-12: BUSINESS: RJR senior scientist Frank Colby sends Blevins a memo suggesting that the company \"develop a new RJR youth-appeal brand based on the concept of going back--at least halfway--to the technological design of the Winston and other filter cigarettes of the 1950s,\" a cigarette which \"delivered more 'enjoyment' or 'kicks' (nicotine).\" Colby said that \"for public relations reasons it would be impossible to go back all the way to the 1955-type cigarettes.\"\n 1996-10-17: Researchers disclose molecular link between a substance in tobacco tar and lung cancer: a benzo (a) pyrene derivative damages lung cancer-suppresser gene, p53, in the exact \"hotspot\" associated with lung cancer. Science magazine\n Ibid.\n \n This wasn't simply a case of 'new discoveries'. As litigation has shown, there was pressures put by economic forces upon scientists who in turn produced the science that backed up what multi-national tobacco companies wanted.\n Thus, one scientist who was in the pay for 25 years was...\n \"According to Jean-Charles Rielle and Pascal Diethelm, the conclusion reached by one of Professor Rylander's projects on respiratory infections in young children and environmental factors, namely that tobacco smoke did not modify risks of illness in young children, was mind-boggling and, when one knew that he was one of Philip Morris's most highly paid consultants, tended to call into question the objectivity of his work.\"\n http://www.tobacco.org/pages.php\n \n I used the example of smoking because its more widely recognized and accepted that there was on-going scientific fraud at the behest of tobacco companies. This is pertinent to the idea of bias in science, and how 'scientific truths' are modified in light of that bias. Many will claim here that this in fact shows the triumph of unfettered science; in over-coming this 'bias'. Right now there's suggestions that mobile (or cell) phones can cause brain tumours. It will be interesting to see what socio-economic forces interact here in the findings of scientists. There's also conflicting evidences in fields of pollution and environmental studies, population studies, resources studies etc. There are the same biases at work now.\n \n Part 1 ends",

   "Part 2 of 2 begins\n \nFeminist science isn't about about (sic) a whole new way to do science, it's about studying discrimination against women in the classroom and the lab. Etc, etc.\n\n \n I never claimed Feminist science is a whole new science, it is a whole different use of science. I suggested that feminist science shows gender bias within what you would call 'science'. What you perceive to be 'science' is full of biases and a priori notions formulated by engendered learning.\n \n It states that from the very beginning, because education is a socialization process, the moment you start learning science, you start engendered learning. That is why when Darwinists believed that women were 'coy' they found the evidence (already cited) to show that women are coy. When we believe that women are more 'active' in society, they find evidence that suggest, even at the level of the 'egg' women are more active. Why do you think this is so?\n \n Thus what you call 'science' should in fact be called 'male dominated science'. It is one version of many many different sciences.\n \n Marxist science shows Marxist bias in science, just as in your version of science, there's capitalist bias. Marxist scientists will look for evidence of co-operation of early man. Engels wrote \"The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man\" showing how Marxist theory on the means of production was instrumental in the evolution of man. (He also wrote \"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\" which continues the Marxist model into historical times; but this falls out of the scope of our subject).\n Engels said: \"Labour begins with the making of tools.\"\n http://art-bin.com/art/oengelsape.html\n \n \"But the use and manufacturing of tools, Engels explained, also increases the usefulness and purposefulness of joint activity, of social labour. Both tool production - and social labour raised the question of language and speech.\n \"First comes labour, after it and side by side with it, articulate speech. These were the two most essential stimuli under the influence of which the brain of the ape gradually changed into that of man.\n The further development of the brain, of course, would interact with labour processes and social intercourse to develop greater capacity for language, for reflection, judgment and abstract thought. The accumulated effects of these interacting processes led to human evolution.\"\n http://www.marxist.com/scienceandtech/HumanDevelopment.html\n \n This shows that there focus of science is biased, and they will search for evidences to back up their biases. It is \"Marxist Science\" In a similar way, the notion of ?The Selfish Gene? is understandable in a capitalist framework.\n \n \nAs for your few papers which did comment upon personal bias effecting research, I already alluded to that in my post, which I notice you haven't responded to yet. People are human. Personal bias exists. People will on occasion slant their results, either consciously or subconsciously, to bring greater glory to themselves, their country, whatever. That's why the worldwide scientific community examines and debates things, to help avoid those biases.\n\n \n Odd then that you don't recognize, or don't want to recognize the extent of this bias. They're not suggesting a few individual scientists here and there allow their personal engendered bias to enter into science; if that's what you now suggest. Those people 'examining' science are themselves the subject of biases and socialization through education. That is why the Feminist critiques show that gender bias in embedded in science.\n \n \nFrankly, I suspect what you're doing here is similar to what you did with Godel's theorem. You're throwing up chaff, in an attempt to distract people from a subject you don't want to discuss. I don't know if you actually believe anything you've said about the above or not, it really doesn't matter. It's all just an aside from the issue I raised here: http://www.4forums.com/political/sh...6&postcount=242\n \n So please, stop the delaying tactics.\n\n \n No I think you can say that there is 'some bias' in science and that's the end. You have dozens of studies in bias, and for you, it's only a few bad eggs, and even they're weeded out by some people obviously immune to (social, cultural, economic, political, gender) bias. I don't agree with all the political bias of the sites I cited, however they are enough for me to show me that science is not homogenous as you and others here want to believe.\n \n I have showed systemic biases as evidenced by Marxist critiques of capitalist science, capitalist critiques of Marxist science, and feminist critiques of both. There is systemic bias in nationalistic sciences. There are economic biases that are clearly shown in the case of smoking, and less clear, but still real in other current issues - such as cellular phones causing tumours.\n \n Where does science say we come from? Well, perhaps you believe that evolutionary science is immune from all these biases. Well, here I've shown Marxist versions of evolution, and capitalist versions of evolution.\n I?ve stated 19th century sexist notions of the development of female characteristics compared to current more egalitarian notions.\n \n For you it is a simple belief that there?s no ultimate truth in religion, because there?s different religions. Well, not only are there many versions of science, science itself never claims to know the ultimate truth of anything.\n \n For you, your retort (and that of Close_shave_can) is ?No it?s not?.\n \n End",

   "Ungerdunn doesn't actually feel the need to explain the difference between 'in conjunction with' and 'linked'.\n\n Well, ok. I assumed that someone with an elementry understanding of English could understand from the context in which they were used. I forget that you pull bits and pieces out of context and assign meaning rooted in your own delusions.\n \n I'm not going back to look at what I said. It becomes tiresome to continually point out your failure to comprehend English but I can discuss what I intended. I probably said that Darwin didn't used the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" until the 4th edition and then he only used it in conjunction with his own term, \"natural selection.\"\n \n To you that statment became a claim by me that Darwin never used the phrase. Clearly you had considerable trouble in understanding simple English. If you actually understood what I said, then the alternative is a deliberate attempt at deceit. Since a lie would have been so easy to disprove, I can only assume it is a problem with English.\n \n But I digress. At one point I even quoted every case in Chapter IV (the chapter from which you pulled your one out of context cite) where Darwin used the phrase, \"survival of the fittest,\" and showed that he always made reference to natural selection in conjunction with that use. In other words, he linked both phrases gramatically, usually with the conjunction \"or.\" So it should be clear from reading what I said that my intent was to indicate that Darwin NEVER used the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" without also making a reference to natural selection. Perhaps you if you knew that the verb \"conjoin\" means to link together, in this case Darwin linked them gramatically, usually with \"or\". He used them in conjunction, i.e., linked together. The ideas are really quite simple.\n \n By the way, the word \"or\" is a conjunction. So it should have been pretty clear to anyone with a basic understanding of English grammar what I was talking about, although it's getting to the point where actual comprehension on your part isn't expected anymore. In spite of your arguments in other threads, \"or\" is a conjunction and not a noun, even though it is used in the title of the movie, \"Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\"\n \nNor does he feel the need to show what he claims to have taught me, or to recant for claiming that he taught me about Spencer coining a phase.\n\n Certainly. In post #113 on page 8 I informed you of that fact. You incorrectly tried to link Darwinism and Hitler rather than more correctly linking Spencer and Hitler. Hitler misused Spencer's economic theory. But you didn't know that until I pointed it out to you.\n \n You might notice that on that page I also explained to you the basics of Darwinism. You continually claim that I haven't. In other posts I also quoted letters of Darwin to Wallace that show that you are wrong. Sadly, you fail to admit your error and realize that any science that contradicts your mythology is not to blame for Hitler.\n \n By the way, you never did respond to similar logic about Christian Naziism. Hitler was a Christian and always proclaimed to be doing his Christian duty in his attempts to exterminate the Jews. To your way of thinking, Jesus must therefore be at fault for the Holocaust. You keep ducking this question (can't blame you), probably because you realize that a logical response would undermine your own position on Darwinism.\n \nUngerdunn also believes that if he repeats his mantra long enough, it might actually resonate with some of the readers.\n\n Not sure what you are talking about. Perhaps it is that responding to your constant failure to educate yourself before speaking sounds like a mantra.\n \nHe now askes me to answer a question about reading something, whilst refusing to answer my questions about his ID, and also whether he's going to apologise for being rude.\n\n Yes. I asked if you had read G\u00f6del or any of the other sources cited by Kronus. I also asked if you had read the pages that you cited. It seems not. I do notice that you don't actually cite any authoritative source - just a line or two from some internet site. And isn't it strange that when one actually reads the pages you cite it is apparent that you are wrong. The site doesn't say what you claim. Take page G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem that you cited. I gave you three statements of the theorem from that page, all of which contradict what you claim.\n \n And what do questions about my ID have to do with whether or not you have read you own sources, or any source? Why is my ID meaningful as to whether you can speak about Darwinism without having read Darwin? Why is it meaningful to your failure to have read G\u00f6del?\n \nNote too, he's dropped his 'special knowledge' argument about Darwin, based on his extensive reading on the subject not only did he fail to pick up on Darwin's notion that a tautology is a superior phrase to \"Natural Selection\", he's also not admitted that he was wrong. Simply here he goes on to the attack\n \n Attack! Attack! Attack\n\n Pointing out your errors is not an attack. If you are so sensitive that you feel that opposing opinions are attacks, perhaps you shouldn't be posting here. And I made no arguments about special knowledge of anything. I only pointed out that you were wrong because you seem to lack the integrity to actually educate yourself before you claim expertise. If you feel that actually reading the books one cites before discussing what the author meant, then yes, I have special knowledge. It is at least special as far as you are concerned.\n \n As for the fact that the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" being a tautology, I also pointed that out to you. It was clear that you didn't even understand what a tautology was by your answer. You still haven't grasped the fact that it is the phrase that expresses a tautology and not Darwin's theories. You even seem to believe that name \"natural selection\" is a tautology and have failed to show why. Your claim that since Darwin linked (in a gramatical structure where the two words were joined by the conjunction \"or\") the two phrases, that somehow the phrase \"natural selection\" is also a tautology. You have again opened your mouth without understanding what you were saying - once again because of a faulty grasp of basic English.\n \nHe said something about respect being earned, but sees no reason to answer my questions, but is indignant never-the-less.\n\n You're projecting. I'm not the one who sends PMs to insult and declare victory. I'm not upset in the least by your misrepresentations. I enjoy poking fun at you and your lack of learning on topics of which you speak. Go back and read what was said and you will find that you are the one showing anger. Poor baby.\n \nUngerdunn's indignation here, is a one-way street. Anger management classes are the key\n\n I assume that you are speaking from experience. You seem out of control, especially since you see attacks when someone points out your errors and you failure to actually learn about the topics that you discuss. You don't just show anger, you show rage. This little attempt at insult by you is actually funny. And the paranoia! Take the followinig that you responded to Kronus:\n \nI suspect from your writing style that you've posted here as someone else. Is this true? You sound exactly like Ungerdunn.\n\n Could it be that since Kronus and I are both telling you that you are wrong and for the same reasons that we sound alike? Could it be that both Kronus and I know more about the topic than you? Could it be that you have realized that your position is indefensible?\n \n And your latest insulting PM isn't very Chrisitan. It seems that you are a Christian in name only.",

You can now claim, only in hindsight that it is the triumph of 'science'. It goes to show that there were economic pressures on scientists forcing them to come up with science that suited their masters. For 50 years scientific evidences were brought forward suggesting that smoking was (mostly) harmless. However, with current issues such as 'mobile phones' we don't know what is 'the truth' in relation to science. We see conflicting theories being brought forth. Some say they cause 'brain tumours', some say 'no'. Which is the truth? This is showing 'bias at work'. Mobile phone companies issue statements of scientific proofs all the time. Are they correct? We'll only know in hindsight. I have shown bias in the past, and bias in the present.\n \n I've presented over-whelming evidences of bias, individual, systemic, institutionalised, corporate etc. You admitted only before that scientists were biased, now you say that science is biased. Are you sure you want to stick with this new position? I'd be glad to have you on board with this.\n \n \nYou continuously throw up smoke screens to try to hide that fact that you know your religion doesn't explain the physical world as well as science does.\n\n \n Based on which version of science? Yes, we've come full circle. Which version of science is 'science', and which isn't being driven by various socio-philosophical forces?

Because their bias can't believe possibly that there's an intelligent force behind creation, so they come up with anything, even oily slime on glass (Miller-Urey).\n \nYou're wrong.

I probably said that Darwin didn't used the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" until the 4th edition and then he only used it in conjunction with his own term, \"natural selection.\"\n\n \n Yes, you've said that. You've also said the opposite.\n Post 143\n \nBut they aren't synonyms. They aren't always used in conjunction. I pointed out to you that evolutionary biologists don't use the phrase. You are easily confused. Darwin used the phrase because it had come into common use, but he always linked it to his term, natural selection which he explained in great detail..\n\n \n Therefore, my question remains... What, to you, is the difference between always using something in conjunction, and always linking them?\n \n Further to that, are you trying to be sneaky? Why do you rely here on the 4th ed, and not on the later one which has Darwin preferring \"Survival of the Fittest\"? Is there an even later edition you know of where he recants and says \"Go back to the 4th ed.\"?\n \nTo you that statment (sic) became a claim by me that Darwin never used the phrase. Clearly you had considerable trouble in understanding simple English.\n\n Yes, you'd think it a dead issue. This would now be the third time we've dealt with this one! You're a sore winner emoticon_xgood\n \nIf you actually understood what I said, then the alternative is a deliberate attempt at deceit. Since a lie would have been so easy to disprove, I can only assume it is a problem with English.\n\n It is called 'a mistake' something you're incapable of admitting too. Attack! Attack! Attack! I note you've not shown any remorse for your own vulgarity. You then repeat that you've taught me something...\n \n \nBut I digress. At one point I even quoted every case in Chapter IV (the chapter from which you pulled your one out of context cite) where Darwin used the phrase, \"survival of the fittest,\" and showed that he always made reference to natural selection in conjunction with that use. In other words, he linked both phrases gramatically (sic), usually with the conjunction \"or.\" So it should be clear from reading what I said that my intent was to indicate that Darwin NEVER used the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" without also making a reference to natural selection. Perhaps you if you knew that the verb \"conjoin\" means to link together, in this case Darwin linked them gramatically (sic), usually with \"or\". He used them in conjunction, i.e., linked together. The ideas are really quite simple.\n\n \n Then why, in Post 143 would you state that they aren't always used in conjunction, but always 'linked'? What to you, is the difference?\n \n \nBy the way, the word \"or\" is a conjunction. So it should have been pretty clear to anyone with a basic understanding of English grammar what I was talking about, although it's getting to the point where actual comprehension on your part isn't expected anymore. In spite of your arguments in other threads, \"or\" is a conjunction and not a noun, even though it is used in the title of the movie, \"Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\"\n\n Thanks for sharing that with us, Lurch. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nNor does he feel the need to show what he claims to have taught me, or to recant for claiming that he taught me about Spencer coining a phase. \n\n \n \nCertainly. In post #113 on page 8 I informed you of that fact. You incorrectly tried to link Darwinism and Hitler rather than more correctly linking Spencer and Hitler. Hitler misused Spencer's economic theory. But you didn't know that until I pointed it out to you.\n\n \n Clearly you thought you'd taught me this concept. Post 165 I showed where I made the acknowledgement of Spencer which pre-date your claim to have taught me at post #113 of the current thread...Why you'd repeat such a falsehood?\n \n Post 41 of \"Another mistake?\"\n Post title: \"Survival of the Fittest in an historical context\"\n \n\"Survival of the Fittest\" was a term first coined by pioneer sociologist Herbert Spencer\n http://www2.truman.edu/~rgraber/cultev/spencer.html \n\n \n Post 9 of \"The many faces of science\"\n \nHerbert Spencer had already coined the phrase \"Survival of the Fittest\".\n\n \n Post 51 of \"The Many Faces of Science\"\n \nAnyway, Herbert Spencer did come up with the tautology, however, importantly, Darwin adopted it for later editions of his books... so again everyone gets the blame, except for Darwin.\n\n \n Why do you think making the same false claim now would be right? To use your terminology; \"That wouldn't be a lie, would it?\" emoticon_xgood Why don't you admit to your obvious mistake here? Quite clearly these pre-date your lesson. Yet you believe that if you persist with an obvious false claim (of education), that it will somehow be more credible(!?)\n \n You also claimed to have 'taught' me something else, which you've not specified. I note you've had several opportunities to invent this, but you've not come up with anything other then repetition of the claim.\n \n \nYou might notice that on that page I also explained to you the basics of Darwinism. You continually claim that I haven't. In other posts I also quoted letters of Darwin to Wallace that show that you are wrong.\n\n Yes, you re-edited Darwin's letter.\n Post 182 you essentially showed his objection to be...\n \n \"It is, however, a great objection to this term [survival of the fittest] that it cannot be used as a substantive governing a verb; and that this is a real objection I infer from H. Spencer continually using the words, natural selection.\n\n That is, his objection rests solely on its limited use in English. He goes on to say that the term 'Natural Selection' is weak, and wishes that he had been urged to use \"Survival of the Fittest\" two months earlier, which is before he published his next edition of Origins!! (see http://pages.britishlibrary.net/cha...etters2_04.html) which is why by the time of the 6th edition, he prefers the term \"Survival of the Fittest\" over \"Natural Selection\" \n \n \nSadly, you fail to admit your error and realize that any science that contradicts your mythology is not to blame for Hitler.\n\n Where have I blamed Darwin for Hitler?\n Post 146\n \nI made it clear that Darwin did not advocate genocide.\n\n I blame Darwinism\n I have suggested that \"Survival of the Fittest\" which is at the heart of Natural Selection is also an idea the Nazis used. They took 'Survival of the Fittest\" as a means of justifying their war on 'lesser-races' (also a Darwin-family contribution)\n \"Further on in his Descent, Darwin elaborates on this theme describing his dream of a future for mankind when the black races of man, as well as the mountain gorilla of Africa, will hopefully become extinct, thus enhancing the chances for the evolutionary advancement of the more \"civilized\" races of man: \"At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilized state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the negro or Australian and the gorilla.\" (Descent of Man, Chapter Six: On the Affinities and Genealogy of Man, On the Birthplace and Antiquity of Man)\"\n http://www.thedarwinpapers.com/olds...apers12HTML.htm\n or\n http://www.infidels.org/library/his...ent_of_man.html\n \n \"The result of all racial crossing is therefore in brief always the following: \n Lowering of the level of the higher race; Physical and intellectual regression and hence the beginning of a slowly but surely progressing sickness.\"\n Adolf Hitler, \"Mein Kampf: Volume One - A Reckoning Chapter XI: Nation and Race\"\n http://www.hitler.org/writings/Mein_Kampf/mkv1ch11.html\n \n \"A central theme of Hitler's thinking was the concept of struggle. In the nineteenth century the naturalist Charles Darwin had explained how in the world of nature when the environment changed some of the species with favourable variations survived better that others. Darwin called this ?natural selection\". \n Social Darwinism was a concept that emerged later in the nineteenth century suggesting that what applied to nature could also apply to human society \"that the strong prevail over the weak, that superior races prevail over inferior races. This concept with its theme of struggle and survival of the fittest appealed to Hitler. \"Struggle\" wrote Hitler \"is the father of all things\".He who wants to live must fight and who does not want to fight in this world where external struggle is the law of life has no right to exist\".\n http://www.planetpapers.com/Assets/3197.php\n \n Nazi governmental policy was openly influenced by Darwinism, the Zeitgeist of both science and educated society of the time\n Stein, G., Biological science and the roots of Nazism, American Scientist 76(1):50?58, 1988. quoted at http://www.trueorigin.org/holocaust.asp\n \n This conclusion has justified a wide variety of governmental and scientific policies, not the least infamous were racial genocide programs.\n Gould, Stephen Jay, 1981.

The Twisted Road to Auschwitz, University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Illinois, pp. 147-149.\n quoted at\n http://www.biblebelievers.net/Creat...ce/kjcevol1.htm\n \n \nBy the way, you never did respond to similar logic about Christian Nazism. Hitler was a Christian and always proclaimed to be doing his Christian duty in his attempts to exterminate the Jews. To your way of thinking, Jesus must therefore be at fault for the Holocaust. You keep ducking this question (can't blame you), probably because you realize that a logical response would undermine your own position on Darwinism.\n\n Yes, you've made this sweeping statement. Have you got any Christian doctrine in mind? Please give references from Scripture; any version of the Bible.\n \n \nUngerdunn also believes that if he repeats his mantra long enough, it might actually resonate with some of the readers.\n\n \n \nNot sure what you are talking about. Perhaps it is that responding to your constant failure to educate yourself before speaking sounds like a mantra.\n\n \n You have now two mantras. One is that you believe I don't understand English. The other, equally false is that you taught me about Spencer's coining of \"Survival of the Fittest\" emoticon_xgood\n \nHe now asks me to answer a question about reading something, whilst refusing to answer my questions about his ID, and also whether he's going to apologise for being rude. \n\n \n \nYes. I asked if you had read G\u00f6del or any of the other sources cited by Kronus.\n\n Kronous mentions a book. He suggests that somewhere in that book is the proof of his 'just-so' argument. You've given a very liberal definition here of 'citation'. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nI also asked if you had read the pages that you cited. It seems not. I do notice that you don't actually cite any authoritative source - just a line or two from some internet site.\n And isn't it strange that when one actually reads the pages you cite it is apparent that you are wrong. The site doesn't say what you claim. Take page G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem that you cited. I gave you three statements of the theorem from that page, all of which contradict what you claim.\n\n \n I believe you are referring to Post225\n \n...within any given branch of mathematics, there would always be some propositions that couldn't be proven either true or false using the rules and axioms ... of that mathematical branch itself. \n\n \n...within a rigidly logical system...propositions can be formulated that are undecidable or undemonstrable within the axioms of the system. \n\n \n...given any consistent set of arithmetical axioms, there are true mathematical statements that cannot be derived from the set.\n\n \n Not only have you tried massive re-edits, and not shown which of my sources you've quoted, but you still fail to get 'it'.\n I've stated that within any system, ultimately something can't be known. What you missed is that in order to know something, you must go out of that system into a system which, of itself, must also logically never be able to know for certain. SO, you need to go outside it, and so on ad infinitum - the end result is that no maths systems can, in the end be truly known to be accurate. That's what my oft cited source says!\n \n \nAnd what do questions about my ID have to do with whether or not you have read you own sources, or any source? Why is my ID meaningful as to whether you can speak about Darwinism without having read Darwin? Why is it meaningful to your failure to have read G\u00f6del?\n\n \n So, are you trying to hide something then? Mmm, sounds like it. I asked you this question BEFORE you asked me about Godel. Pertinent then that you feel happy to ignore my questions, then, if I don't answer yours, it must 'mean something'. emoticon_xgood\n \n Note too, he's dropped his 'special knowledge' argument about Darwin, based on his extensive reading on the subject not only did he fail to pick up on Darwin's notion that a tautology is a superior phrase to \"Natural Selection\", he's also not admitted that he was wrong. Simply here he goes on to the attack\n Attack! Attack! Attack! \n\n \n \nPointing out your errors is not an attack. \n\n Please tell me how attempting to re-work quotes helps your case?\n \n \nIf you are so sensitive that you feel that opposing opinions are attacks, perhaps you shouldn't be posting here. And I made no arguments about special knowledge of anything. I only pointed out that you were wrong because you seem to lack the integrity to actually educate yourself before you claim expertise. If you feel that actually reading the books one cites before discussing what the author meant, then yes, I have special knowledge. It is at least special as far as you are concerned.\n\n \n You have claimed a special knowledge; that if I read and understand all of Darwin, I'll be able to reason away his saying that he prefers a tautology over \"Natural Selection\". You must have a special insight to be able to determine that when Darwin says he prefers it, he actually means the complete opposite emoticon_xgood You've yet to show me how you've come to this special understanding.\n \n \nAs for the fact that the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" being a tautology, I also pointed that out to you. It was clear that you didn't even understand what a tautology was by your answer. You still haven't grasped the fact that it is the phrase that expresses a tautology and not Darwin's theories. You even seem to believe that name \"natural selection\" is a tautology and have failed to show why. Your claim that since Darwin linked (in a gramatical (sic) structure where the two words were joined by the conjunction \"or\") the two phrases, that somehow the phrase \"natural selection\" is also a tautology. You have again opened your mouth without understanding what you were saying - once again because of a faulty grasp of basic English.\n\n \n He makes them, through conjoining/lining them synonymous; that he does so 'always' as you agree. He also prefers a tautology to \"Natural Selection\" thinking it a better phrase.",

   "Fine, Monty. Let's put aside everything else for the moment and concentrate on Godel. We'll use your quote. I'll disect it line by line. I'll show that your interpretation is wrong. My demonstration will be so clear that everyone else reading this will be able to follow it and understand it to be correct. The purpose of this exercise? Twofold. To see if you can follow a logical argument, and to see if you are capable of recognizing when you're wrong.\n \n First, the quote:\n \n \n\"In 1931, the Czech-born mathematician Kurt G\u00f6del demonstrated that within any given branch of mathematics, there would always be some propositions that couldn't be proven either true or false using the rules and axioms ... of that mathematical branch itself. You might be able to prove every conceivable statement about numbers within a system by going outside the system in order to come up with new rules and axioms, but by doing so you'll only create a larger system with its own unprovable statements. The implication is that all logical system of any complexity are, by definition, incomplete; each of them contains, at any given time, more true statements than it can possibly prove according to its own defining set of rules.\"\n\n \n Now, your conclusion;\n \nThe implication is that you can't in the end, know for certain anything in maths, because you need to keep testing anything by a system outside it ad infinitum. \n\n \n Ok, what's being said in the first line? Every branch of math has axioms, which are very basic statements which are taken as assumptions within that branch of math. For example, Euclidian geometry has the axiom, \"the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.\" Non-Euclidian geometry does not use that axiom. In addition to axioms, a mathematical system needs rules to manipulate the axioms. Formal logic is an example of such a set of rules. One can use these rules to manipulate the axioms to come up with new propositions. You can then manipulate the propositions to come up with more propositions, etc, etc. You can also make up a propostion from scratch, and then try to determine, by applying the rules of the system to the body of axioms and propostions already developed, whether or not this new propostion is true or false, within that system. Godel, however, says that regardless of your system, there will be some propositions for which this will not work, whose truth can not be determined. \n \n The next line says that you could prove your new propostion by creating a new rule or axiom, but by doing so you've created a new system, and this new system will then have it's own unprovable propositions. You would have proved your first proposition at the expense of generating new unprovable propositions, with regards to your new system.\n \n The last line summarizes the previous two. Any system will have a large number of true statements. Most of these can be proven from within the system. Some however, cannot be proven from within the system. By expanding the system, you can prove them. However, by doing so you've created more propositions which can't be proven true from within that new system. Thus, there does not exist a system for which you can prove that every true statement within it is true.\n \n Now, to summarize Monty. He says that nothing in math is provable, because to prove any statement what so ever in any mathematical system requires going outside that system.\n \n Godel says that while most truths are provable within a given system, a subset of the truths in a system can only be proven by expanding the system. Monty says that nothing in math is provable.\n \n Now the question is: Is Monty capable of following this explanation and admitting his error?",

   "I blame Darwinism\n\n Silly. Hitler had nothing to do with either Darwin or Darwinism. Hitler misapplied the social theories of Spencer, a man that you didn't know existed until I told you about him.\n \nI have suggested that \"Survival of the Fittest\" which is at the heart of Natural Selection is also an idea the Nazis used.\n\n No you didn't. You said that \"survival of the fittest\" was at the heart of Darwinism. You weren't aware that Darwin actually proposed 5 separate theories of evolution that together comprise Darwinsim until I told you. And now you are still making the bogus claim about Nazis.\n \n And yet more out of context quotes from books that you haven't read!\n \nYes, you've made this sweeping statement.\n\n So did you. Would you like some quotes from Hitler about doing his Christian duty? You haven't shown where Hitler quoted Darwin. I guess it is a question that you can't answer (or don't understand). It's really quite simple. Hitler claimed to be doing his Christian duty. Why isn't Christianity to blame?\n \nOne is that you believe I don't understand English. The other, equally false is that you taught me about Spencer's coining of \"Survival of the Fittest\"\n\n The first is clear from your own misunderstanding of simple English. Show that it is other wise. We've already discussed the difference between \"Darwin always used 'survival of the fittest' in conjunction with a reference to natural selection\" and \"Darwin did not always use natural selection in conjunction with \"survival of the fittest.\" It is really a matter of quite simple English. While all dogs are vertebrates, not all vertebrates are dogs. I have tried to explain such simple concepts to you before. You just seem to have a problem with basic English grammar.\n \nKronous mentions a book.\n\n A lie. Kronus asked if you had read G\u00f6del or two other mathematicians and them suggested a book for you to read to educate yourself.\n \nNot only have you tried massive re-edits, and not shown which of my sources you've quoted, but you still fail to get 'it'.\n\n Actually, I did a cut and paste from the site that you linked. Isn't it funny that you didn't recognize three cut and pastes from you own cite? If 'it' means that you are confused, I get it.\n \nI've stated that within any system, ultimately something can't be known.\n\n Bull. What you claimed was that nothing could be known.\n \nWhat you missed is that in order to know something, you must go out of that system into a system which, of itself, must also logically never be able to know for certain.\n\n And that is balderdash! To know physics your must go outside of physics. To know thermodynamics you must go outside of thermodynamics. To know religion you must go outside of religion. To know Orthodox Christianity you must go outside of Orthodox Christianity. Utter nonsense.\n \nthe end result is that no maths systems can, in the end be truly known to be accurate. That's what my oft cited source says!\n\n Yet again there seems to be a bit of cognitive disconnect - lack of logical understanding or lack of comprehension of simple English? I don't know for sure.\n \nSo, are you trying to hide something then? Mmm, sounds like it. I asked you this question BEFORE you asked me about Godel. Pertinent then that you feel happy to ignore my questions, then, if I don't answer yours, it must 'mean something'.\n\n Again with the logical disconnect. What does my ID have to do with the topic under discussion? Why do you feel justified in failing to defend your unsuported assertions because I don't answer your questions about my \"ID\". OK. I'm ungerdunn. This will be my 75th post. I still don't see how that is relevant to the discussion, but then, I actually grasp the logical and gramatical concepts of the discussion.\n \nPlease tell me how attempting to re-work quotes helps your case?\n\n Please tell me how lying about what I said helps your case. Please show me where I claimed special knowledge. Please show me what quotes I reworked. Simply stated, I never claimed \"special knowledge\" about Darwin. I only claimed to have read some of his books. You have admited that you haven't read any. And yet you have claimed \"special knowledge\", claiming to know the \"heart of Darwinism\" (now having changed horses once again after showing you where I explained Darwinsim in my first response). Now, suddenly, you claim that \"survival of the fittest\" is at the heart of natural selection. Up til now you have been arguing that they are the same and that \"survival of the fittest\" was at the heart of Darwinsim. You just keep moving the goal posts. You find that your lack of research makes you look foolish so you change the criteria. I hope you never give me change in the dime store.\n \nYou have claimed a special knowledge;\n\n Nonsense. You have. I only claim to have read Darwin, about Darwin, and have studied Darwinism. It's not special. It is actually common knowledge among many who post here. Sadly, it is common knowledge that you don't share.\n \nthat if I read and understand all of Darwin, I'll be able to reason away his saying that he prefers a tautology over \"Natural Selection\".\n\n No. That isn't the case. I don't think that you will be able to understand. Darwin lived in the Victorian era and I find his writing to be difficult. I have no hope that you will undestand. But I do understand that Darwin didn't believe that \"survival of the fittest\" was a better label for natural selection, and after all, that's all those terms were. The major problem is that neither you nor Hitler understood either. Both of you seem to have the same understanding.\n \nHe makes them, through conjoining/lining (sic) them synonymous; that he does so 'always' as you agree.\n\n Another lie. Darwin always linked \"survival of the fittest\" with a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. How many times do I have to tell you this. By this time you are deliberately lying. Have you no integrity?\n \nHe also prefers a tautology to \"Natural Selection\" thinking it a better phrase.\n\n Nope. Darwin yielded to popular pressure and to arguments of the Christian, Wallace. Darwin never preferred the phrase. If that were true then he would have replaced his references to natural selection in the 4th and later editions, as you claimed in error. He never did. Never once does he use \"survival of the fittest\" without explaining or specifically mentioning natural selection. The opposite is not the case.\n \n And once more, it is the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" that is the tautology. You don't seem to grasp the idea. Natural selection isn't a tautology. Why do I have to explain this simple concept to you time after time? Do you not grasp the meaning of English?\n \nYou must have a special insight to be able to determine that when Darwin says he prefers it, he actually means the complete opposite\n\n But I have cited his letters that show that he didn't prefer it. He never replaced his term with the other, as you claimed in error.\n \nYou've yet to show me how you've come to this special understanding.\n\n But it is you who is claiming some special understanding. You haven't read Darwin by you own admission. I have. You demonstrate on a regular basis that you have no understanding of evolutionary biology. I do based on my degrees. My knowledge isn't special - in fact it is quite basic. But it is more than someone who hasn't bothered to educate herself in the basics. I don't claim authority on topics in which I haven't bothered to educate myself. You do.\n \n As I said before - stick a fork in Montalban cause she's done.\n \n Nothing further to be said. I just can't stand the lies and hysteria anymore. Monty can't defend her assertions and as is typical with creationsts, she keeps moving the goal posts.\n \n Why don't you PM me, Monty, and claim victory with a few more insults? That seems to be the Orthodox Christian thing to do.",

Your statements clearly suggest that you think they are exactly the same thing. It is not my fault if you did not wish to convey this message.",

   " I blame Darwinism \n\n \nSilly. Hitler had nothing to do with either Darwin or Darwinism. \n\n \n Not true, Darwin believe \"Survival of the Fittest\" was a better term for his theory. I posted links to connect \"Survival of the Fittest\" to Hitler. You made some vague association about Christianity and Hitler. You need to give a reference from Christ, and how it's used by Hitler.\n \n \nHitler misapplied the social theories of Spencer,\n\n \n Show me, how he misapplied Darwinism or Spencer, using science and not philosophy.\n \n \n a man that you didn't know existed until I told you about him\n\n \n This has twice been shown to be a fiction created by your own ego. How do you explain posts where I recognise this link that predate by months the creation of this thread?\n \n \nI have suggested that \"Survival of the Fittest\" which is at the heart of Natural Selection is also an idea the Nazis used. \n\n \n \n No you didn't. You said that \"survival of the fittest\" was at the heart of Darwinism. You weren't aware that Darwin actually proposed 5 separate theories of evolution that together comprise Darwinsim (sic) until I told you. And now you are still making the bogus claim about Nazis.\n\n \n You've yet to show my claim about the Nazis is bogus except by you saying 'its bogus'. I provided many pieces of evidence wherein other people are drawing the same conclusion. Your evidence is two fold\n a) no it isn't\n and\n b) he has links to Christianity. (which is irrelevant anyway, because even if he used Christian teachings, it's not exclusive to using Darwinist notions either)\n \n \n So did you. Would you like some quotes from Hitler about doing his Christian duty? You haven't shown where Hitler quoted Darwin. I guess it is a question that you can't answer (or don't understand). It's really quite simple. Hitler claimed to be doing his Christian duty. Why isn't Christianity to blame?\n\n \n So you're saying your defence of a sweeping statement is a sweeping statement?\n \n I never said he quoted Darwin. I said he used Darwinism.\n see\n Nazi governmental policy was openly influenced by Darwinism, the Zeitgeist of both science and educated society of the time\n Stein, G., Biological science and the roots of Nazism, American Scientist 76(1):50?58, 1988. quoted at http://www.trueorigin.org/holocaust.asp\n \n Why isn't Christianity to blame - well show me the quotes from Christ.\n \n \n One is that you believe I don't understand English. The other, equally false is that you taught me about Spencer's coining of \"Survival of the Fittest\" \n\n \nThe first is clear from your own misunderstanding of simple English. Show that it is other wise. We've already discussed the difference between \"Darwin always used 'survival of the fittest' in conjunction with a reference to natural selection\" and \"Darwin did not always use natural selection in conjunction with \"survival of the fittest.\" It is really a matter of quite simple English. While all dogs are vertebrates, not all vertebrates are dogs. I have tried to explain such simple concepts to you before. You just seem to have a problem with basic English grammar.\n\n \n Nice re-construction. You actually said that they're always used in conjunction, then, they're not always used in conjunction, but that they're always linked.\n Your association about dogs and verterbrates; is that applied to the words 'conjunction' and 'link'. Are you saying that not all conjunctions are links, but all links are conjunctions?\n \nKronous mentions a book. \n\n \nA lie. Kronus asked if you had read G\u00f6del or two other mathematicians and them suggested a book for you to read to educate yourself.\n\n \n No, he mentioned a book. He gave the title, for sure, but he's stated no where in that book is his evidence. Saying 'go read this book' is something you call a citation. I'd heave called it a citation if he gave a reference to wherein the book, or a web-site etc.\n \n \nNot only have you tried massive re-edits, and not shown which of my sources you've quoted, but you still fail to get 'it'. \n\n \nActually, I did a cut and paste from the site that you linked. Isn't it funny that you didn't recognize three cut and pastes from you own cite? If 'it' means that you are confused, I get it.\n\n I, as you already criticise, post lots of quotes. That you would not cite which one it was, and from massive re-edits, you now project your failing to do so back on me. Kudos.\n \n \nI've stated that within any system, ultimately something can't be known. \n\n \nBull. What you claimed was that nothing could be known.\n\n \n Indeed, in science, nothing ever can be. Science agrees that in the end it can't prove anything.\n \n \nSo, are you trying to hide something then? Mmm, sounds like it. I asked you this question BEFORE you asked me about Godel. Pertinent then that you feel happy to ignore my questions, then, if I don't answer yours, it must 'mean something'. \n\n \n \nAgain with the logical disconnect. What does my ID have to do with the topic under discussion? Why do you feel justified in failing to defend your unsuported (sic) assertions because I don't answer your questions about my \"ID\". OK. I'm ungerdunn. This will be my 75th post. I still don't see how that is relevant to the discussion, but then, I actually grasp the logical and gramatical (sic) concepts of the discussion.\n\n \n I wanted to know who you are. Now that you make a claim, we can examine it.\n \n It is clear from a reference you made two times earlier, about me not knowing the difference between a noun and a verb (when there was no context for you making such a statement) is clear indication to me that in fact you've been on this post before under another username. (even in a previous post you said\n \nBy the way, the word \"or\" is a conjunction. So it should have been pretty clear to anyone with a basic understanding of English grammar what I was talking about, although it's getting to the point where actual comprehension on your part isn't expected anymore. In spite of your arguments in other threads, \"or\" is a conjunction and not a noun, even though it is used in the title of the movie, \"Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\"\n\n \n This is the argument that I had with Lurch around November of last year, whether a word in a title is a noun or not. It is irrelevant for discussion purposes here wether it is or isn't. What is relevant is that thrice you've tried to provoke a re-working of this argument. An argument that you should not know about if you've only just joined as Ungerdunn - unless you make the claim here now that you've read back through 6 months of debates. (an alternative theory is you've been reading them all this time, and only more recently decided to log on - but it's funny then that you'd remember this particular line of argument). Last touched upon c. Post 81 of \"So, how did they get all those animals on the ark?\" written in January of this year. It is why, like then, you constantly questioned my ability to understand English\n \n It goes now to the credibility of you as an honest poster. One who has herein already laid claim to have taught me a lesson, when quite clearly I can produce posts that pre-date your arrival on this board - unless of course you were here under another username.\n \n \n Please tell me how attempting to re-work quotes helps your case? \n\n \nPlease tell me how lying about what I said helps your case. Please show me where I claimed special knowledge.\n\n You claimed that only through reading Darwin's work you were able to discern how when Darwin says \"Survival of the Fittest\" is a better describer, he was meaning something else, because you insisted that he never said it was a better phrase. You've still yet to admit that he did. You re-worked the letter from Darwin to Spencer, ignoring the fact where he actually says that he only wished he'd have known about it earlier.[/Quote]\n \n \nPlease show me what quotes I reworked.\n\n You claimed you taught me about 'Spencer'. I've shown you evidence before your statement where I acknowledge the link. Therefore the only way you could have taught me is if I were some how able to tell you were going to say something in the future, or you're simply coming up with a different chronology of who said what, when.\n How do you account for posts that pre-date your 'lesson'? Simply repeating your ego driven beliefs doesn't help\n \n \nSimply stated, I never claimed \"special knowledge\" about Darwin. I only claimed to have read some of his books. You have admited (sic) that you haven't read any.\n\n \n That doesn't however mean that I have read nothing Darwin has written. As I stated before, I don't count a book as being read, until it's read all the way through.\n \n \nAnd yet you have claimed \"special knowledge\", claiming to know the \"heart of Darwinism\" (now having changed horses once again after showing you where I explained Darwinsim (sic) in my first response). Now, suddenly, you claim that \"survival of the fittest\" is at the heart of natural selection. Up til now you have been arguing that they are the same and that \"survival of the fittest\" was at the heart of Darwinsim (sic). You just keep moving the goal posts. You find that your lack of research makes you look foolish so you change the criteria. I hope you never give me change in the dime store.\n\n \n Survival of the Fittest and Natural Selection are made synonymous. There's no moving of the goal posts. You say that they're always linked/in conjunction.\n \n \n You have claimed a special knowledge; \n\n \n Nonsense. You have. I only claim to have read Darwin, about Darwin, and have studied Darwinism. It's not special. It is actually common knowledge among many who post here. Sadly, it is common knowledge that you don't share.\n\n \n Why don't you admit you were wrong about Darwin preferring \"Survival of the Fittest\"? You must have some reason to believe that he didn't even though he said he did. You obviously have a knowledge special, and you're not sharing it with the readers of these posts.\n \n \nthat if I read and understand all of Darwin, I'll be able to reason away his saying that he prefers a tautology over \"Natural Selection\". \n\n \nNo. That isn't the case. I don't think that you will be able to understand. Darwin lived in the Victorian era and I find his writing to be difficult. I have no hope that you will undestand (sic). But I do understand that Darwin didn't believe that \"survival of the fittest\" was a better label for natural selection, and after all, that's all those terms were. The major problem is that neither you nor Hitler understood either. Both of you seem to have the same understanding.\n\n \n His very words were that he thought it a better term.\n \"I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term natural selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate\"\n \n http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species-6th-edition/chapter-03.html\n \n Even with faced with his words, you believe he means something else, through some sort of special appreciation you've come by, by reading an earlier edition of this book.\n \n \nHe makes them, through conjoining/lining (sic) them synonymous; that he does so 'always' as you agree. \n\n \nAnother lie. \n\n I quoted your words saying 'always linked' and 'always in conjunction. Simply insulting me doesn't change what you wrote.\n \n \nDarwin always linked \"survival of the fittest\" with a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. How many times do I have to tell you this. By this time you are deliberately lying. Have you no integrity?\n\n But at his 6th ed. he thought that, instead of using the term \"Natural Selection\" a better term would be \"Survival of the Fittest\", to be used instead of it.\n \n He also prefers a tautology to \"Natural Selection\" thinking it a better phrase. \n\n \nNope. Darwin yielded to popular pressure and to arguments of the Christian, Wallace. Darwin never preferred the phrase. If that were true then he would have replaced his references to natural selection in the 4th and later editions, as you claimed in error. He never did. Never once does he use \"survival of the fittest\" without explaining or specifically mentioning natural selection. The opposite is not the case.\n\n \n So, you're saying he didn't prefer it (even though I've quoted where he did). You provide absolutely no evidence, but try and apologise for Darwin by blaming everyone else who compelled him to use it.Yes, everyone's to blame but Darwin. Likewise, when you produce conflicting word use, that's my inability to understand you!\n \n \nAnd once more, it is the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" that is the tautology. You don't seem to grasp the idea. Natural selection isn't a tautology. Why do I have to explain this simple concept to you time after time? Do you not grasp the meaning of English?\n\n Your grasp is unique, because when Darwin says he prefers something, according to you, he doesn't. When you say he always uses them in conjunction, you then change this to he always links them.\n \n \nYou must have a special insight to be able to determine that when Darwin says he prefers it, he actually means the complete opposite \n\n \nBut I have cited his letters that show that he didn't prefer it. He never replaced his term with the other, as you claimed in error.\n\n No, you cited a letter where he says it's got restrictive applications in grammer (sic). He also states (and this is the bit you left out), that he's so happy with the phrase, he only wishes he'd been convinced to use it a few months prior. In conjunction with that, we have his words (also quoted above) where he says he prefers it.\n \n We have therefore your evidence (a qualified criticism of the phrase) and my evidence (two less qualified approvals).\n \n \nYou've yet to show me how you've come to this special understanding. \n\n \n \nBut it is you who is claiming some special understanding. You haven't read Darwin by you own admission. I have. You demonstrate on a regular basis that you have no understanding of evolutionary biology. I do based on my degrees. My knowledge isn't special - in fact it is quite basic. But it is more than someone who hasn't bothered to educate herself in the basics. I don't claim authority on topics in which I haven't bothered to educate myself. You do.\n\n \n Then explain how Darwin, when he says he prefers the term, that he doesn't.\n \n \nNothing further to be said. I just can't stand the lies and hysteria anymore. Monty can't defend her assertions and as is typical with creationsts (sic), she keeps moving the goal posts.\n\n See the quotes I have posted. You simply say \"no it isn't\" or \"you're lying\"\n \n \nWhy don't you PM me, Monty, and claim victory with a few more insults?\n\n \n There'd be no point. You have no concept of the word 'private' anyway. And, because you're determined that even if Darwin says something, he says something else. And then you just cry \"Lies! All lies!\". You insult people with derogatory words, and then when they raise the issue with you, heap more abuse onto them. Then you never apologise. In short, you're incapable of having a reasoned debate with because you argue Darwin's 'yes' is 'no', and that something 'is always conjunction means 'always in conjunction' but then it doesn't it means 'is always linked'. In short, you're never wrong, even when you present argument against yourself.\n \n \nThat seems to be the Orthodox Christian thing to do.\n\n \n Really, you've had contact with 50.1% of Orthodox Christians? Or do you judge all Orthodoxy by me? However, my time is up.\n \n I'd like to see you repeat your insults about my inability to understand English, and that I lie. (you don't think that these are insults; but observations; even though I'm able to quote your inconsistent arguments)",

   " Any misunderstanding here may be my fault. The bishop's not tracing his personal history back to 33 AD, but his authority and teachings.\n \n I am Antiochian Orthodox. St. Peter, taught by Jesus, in turn founded the church in Antioch. Ignatius of Antioch, one of his more famous pupils, wrote many Epistles. We can test these Epistles against the teachings of Christ and so on to Ignatius' students. Ignatius passed the teachings on, and his student passed them on etc. to the present day. That is Apostolic Succession. I can look to books such as the Didache (written c.120 AD) and see that they celebrated the Eucharist; not a 'special commemorative meal' as some Protestants have; but a celebration in the actual body and blood of Christ.\n\n \n OK, much clearer. I thought that was too outrageous a claim for anyone to make.\n \n \nYes, that's because you were taught a 'science' as science. If you'd been raised in China, you'd have had a different syllabus.\n \n Essentially this is it. When Chinese anthropologists go a digging, they try to find proofs that man evolved in China. That is because they have a nationalist over-arching belief that they take with them. Hence capitalist anthropologists might well show the 'competition' amongst species helped spur man's evolution.\n\n \n Why would I have a different syllabus? The scientific method is the scientific method, it doesn't change. References are references, they don't change. Data is data, it doesn't change.\n \n Do they? Or do they go a digging and then interpret the data as it presents itself? \n \n I agree that under the current Chinese regime there is likely a pro Chinese bias, but IME the Chinese, in particular the geologists I've encountered, are exceptional scientists, and I have not seen any \"Chinese science\" bias in their works.\n \n I read through most of your links Monty, and I agree with Kronus. You posted a lot of links, but I'm not sure they proved your point, if you did indeed have one.\n \n I think where we part ways is our definition of science and its application. Science does not have a goal. Science itself does not set out with a predetermined outcome, anything that is done to support a predetermined outcome is not science, it's fabrication.\n \n I agree that human bias enters science. I've agreed to that in the past. It's unfortunate, but it's a reality. What I don't agree with is that this bias somehow invalidates all science. I think that's a rather ridiculous notion.\n \n If the sole purpose of \"Feminist science\" or \"marxist science\" is to prove that feminism and marxism are the only true ways, then they are not \"science\". \n \n The science of cigarettes was always there. The scientists knew it was harmful, even the ones employed by the tobacco companies. The data didn't lie, science didn't fail, the scientists who knew the facts and didn't report them failed to act as scientists. \n \n \nIt is probably true that she's doing the same male-orientated science as you, because she's been trained to do science in that way. Males dominate science, from the predominance of males in top scientific positions, to class-room dynamics.\n \n PS\n I congratulate your female colleague, she went through a lot to get where she is.\n\n \n Yep, 4 years of Engineering, just like every other engineer at the company. Not easy for sure.\n \n I'm not sure how males dominate or influence fluid dynamics and rock properties, but if you say so. emoticon_rolleyes If you can explain to me how being \"male dominated\" affects the calculation of Poisson's ratio, radial vs. linear flow dynamics, or reserve volumetrics, I'll be impressed.\n \n The current group of grads, I'd say from the early 90s onward, has been ~1/3 women. The face of the oil business is changing, it's no longer the \"old boys club\" that it was in the 70's.\n \n Waxy",

Yesterday the instigator was Saul: the instigator today, Mardochai. Saul was changed into St.Paul, and Mardochai into Karl Marx. By exterminating this pest, we shall do humanity a service of which our soldiers can have no idea. (p 63-65) \n \n 13th December, 1941, midnight: \n \n Christianity is an invention of sick brains: one could imagine nothing more senseless, nor any more indecent way of turning the idea of the Godhead into a mockery.... .... When all is said, we have no reason to wish that the Italians and Spaniards should free themselves from the drug of Christianity. Let's be the only people who are immunised against the disease. (p 118 & 119) \n \n 14th December, 1941, midday: \n \n Kerrl, with noblest of intentions, wanted to attempt a synthesis between National Socialism and Christianity. I don't believe the thing's possible, and I see the obstacle in Christianity itself.... Pure Christianity-- the Christianity of the catacombs-- is concerned with translating Christian doctrine into facts. It leads quite simply to the annihilation of mankind. It is merely whole-hearted Bolshevism, under a tinsel of metaphysics. (p 119 & 120) \n \n 9th April, 1942, dinner: \n \n There is something very unhealthy about Christianity (p 339) \n \n 27th February, 1942, midday: \n \n It would always be disagreeable for me to go down to posterity as a man who made concessions in this field. I realize that man, in his imperfection, can commit innumerable errors-- but to devote myself deliberately to errors, that is something I cannot do. I shall never come personally to terms with the Christian lie. Our epoch Uin the next 200 yearse will certainly see the end of the disease of Christianity.... My regret will have been that I couldn't... behold .\" (p 278)\"\n http://answers.org/apologetics/hitquote.html\n \n Why the differences? Hitler was a politician seeking to gain control of a democracy \"the Weimar Republic\". He would publically announce his great social visions. He wanted to fool the people, he did so, even his nemisis, the communists, signed treaties of friendship and co-operation with him. In private, he let his hair down and actually said what he meant.\n \n Okay, now did Hitler actually use Darwinian terms?\n Darwinism:\n \"Further on in his Descent, Darwin elaborates on this theme describing his dream of a future for mankind when the black races of man, as well as the mountain gorilla of Africa, will hopefully become extinct, thus enhancing the chances for the evolutionary advancement of the more \"civilized\" races of man: \"At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilized state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the negro or Australian and the gorilla.\" (Descent of Man, Chapter Six: On the Affinities and Genealogy of Man, On the Birthplace and Antiquity of Man)\"\n http://www.thedarwinpapers.com/olds...apers12HTML.htm\n \n Nazism:\n \"In Mein Kampf, Hitler used the German word for evolution (Entwicklung) many times, citing \"lower human types.\" He criticized the Jews for bringing \"Negroes into the Rhineland\" with the aim of \"ruining the white race by the necessarily resulting ization.\" He spoke of \"Monstrosities halfway between man and ape\" and lamented the fact of Christians going to \"Central Africa\" to set up \"Negro missions,\" resulting in the turning of \"healthy . . . human beings into a rotten brood of s.\" In his chapter entitled \"Nation and Race,\" he said, \"The stronger must dominate and not blend with the weaker, thus sacrificing his own greatness. Only the born weakling can view this as cruel, but he, after all, is only a weak and limited man; for if this law did not prevail, any conceivable higher development (Hoherentwicklung) of organic living beings would be unthinkable.\" A few pages later, he said, \"Those who want to live, let them fight, and those who do not want to fight in this world of eternal struggle do not deserve to live.\"\"\n http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/hit.htm\n \n \"The result of all racial crossing is therefore in brief always the following: \n Lowering of the level of the higher race; Physical and intellectual regression and hence the beginning of a slowly but surely progressing sickness.\"\n Adolf Hitler, \"Mein Kampf: Volume One - A Reckoning Chapter XI: Nation and Race\"\n http://www.hitler.org/writings/Mein_Kampf/mkv1ch11.html\n \n \" As Clark concluded, Adolf Hitler:\n ' ...was captivated by evolutionary teaching - probably since the time he was a boy. Evolutionary ideas - quite undisguised - lie at the basis of all that is worst in Mein Kampf -and in his public speeches .... Hitler reasoned ... that a higher race would always conquer a lower.\"\n http://www.trueorigin.org/holocaust.asp\n \n \n So, unless someone can come up with some actual Jesus teachings, the link is not established. You need to cite a teaching of Jesus, and show how it was applied by Hitler.\n \n Here's some Bible quotes you can ignore...(thought I'd nip these in the bud, first)\n Sooner will a camel pass through a needle's eye than a great man be 'discovered' by an election.\n -Adolf Hitler with his twist on Mark 10:25 (Mein Kampf)\n \n Verily a man cannot serve two masters. And I consider the foundation or destruction of a religion far greater than the foundation or destruction of a state, let alone a party.\n -Adolf Hitler speaking like Jesus in Matthew 6:24 (Mein Kampf)\n \n But the people on top made a cult of the 'ally,' as if it were the Golden Calf.\n -Adolf Hitler (Mein Kampf)\n (The Golden calf occurs in Exodus 32:1-4)",

   "montalban, I'm interested in your focus on Adolf Hitler regarding the topic of evolution, survival of the fittest etc.. \n\n \n Yes, I've spent quite a bit of time on this; it was to suggest that Nazi science is another version of science. I meant to show that there's a causality...\n \n Darwinism.... Survival of the Fittest... Eugenics/Social Darwinism... Racism.... Nazism.\n \n \nNow, as you have outlined, as time went on Hitler's non-Christian beliefs became more apparent. He was only interested in appeasement of religion for as long as was necessary to achieve power and meet his aims (like with the Concordat with Rome of July 20, 1933) and one can only imagine what might have ultimately happened had he had another 20 years to pursue his ideas.\n\n \n I believe Hitler was evil. This is based on my notions of good and evil, not on science etc. which can't 'test' for evil. Science, because it is neutral, can be used by good and bad people. Because it is as close to 'value-neutral' it is a lot easier for anyone to so use it. (2+2=4 seems to me to have no moral values, but I'd be happy for a comment either way)\n \n Whereas, Christianity is full of positive values -\n love one another\n forgive your enemies\n etc.\n \n If Christ says \"Turn the other cheek\", and you as a Christian, proclaiming to act on His words, go out and kill, the juxtaposition of His words to your actions is shockingly apparent.\n \n There were values incorporated by Darwin in evolution right from its conception, not least because he was trying to show through rational materialistic means, how species came to be. Such values can be seen in notions such as competition for survival, survival of the 'fittest', and the natural extinction of lesser or 'unfit' races etc. which seemed to strike a particular cord with late 1800s western Europe. I think Darwinism isn't 'value-neutral' but science already applied with values, just as there's Marxist science, capitalist science, nationalist science etc. which equally claim to be 'science'. There's so many influences on science it's hard to know what pure science is, that is, sc\n \n \nHitler also saw Darwinism, or aspects of it, as concepts he could use to support and further his racial beliefs and opinions.\n\n \n Indeed. Science should be 'neutral, by itself. But science doesn't live by itself. People use it all the time. The moment that they do, they're investing their own biases into it.\n \n Whether you believe that his is 'misusing' science, or not, is usually argued, not through science, but philosophy. I believe Nazism is evil, so I will argue that they are misusing a lot of things, including science, even though their experiments may have followed scientific method.\n \n \nWhat I'm interested in is this: do you see Hitler as some sort of \"product\" of evolutionary thought? do you think Hitler would have been different had it not been for his knowledge of evolution?\n\n \n I think he is a product of evil. And, in his mind it was easier to use the tool of science, then the tool of Christianity. And, with the notions of 'competition', 'survival', and 'extinction' in Darwinism, it's not hard to see why; even in 'moderate' nations at the time, we have proponents of 'social Darwinism and 'Eugenics'.\n \n Genuine small 'l' liberals, and even Fabian Socialists such as H G Wells hoped that one day programs would be introduced for the regulation of breeding by different classes. Winston Churchill, in his days as a Liberal, was also into Social Darwinism.\n \n \nI also noted your point about the male dominance of science (both in academic and business fields). Well, I think in my country at least that is true, although the balance is shifting now towards a situation of greater equality (as Waxy noted as well).\n\n \n Yes, however, education is itself a process of socialisation.\n \n \nHowever, it is a little one sided to point out male dominance of science alone. There is male dominance full stop in most areas of society, particularly where professional or academic qualification is concerned. There are areas of far greater inequality that exist, and the same male bias's you say exist in science will exist just about anywhere, be it City Finance, the Military or the Judiciary.\n\n \n Yes you are correct. Maleness dominates. However, even feminism has agendas.. and can (imiss-)use 'science' too.\n \n In the early 1970s a group of radical feminists went so far as to suggest that it was physically impossible for a woman to achieve sexual orgasm whilst having penetrative sex! They had empirical data; so much so that they insisted that even if the woman experienced an orgasm, she was said to be deceiving her self.... \"That even in a woman's sexuality, there is deceit on the part of men, and complacency on the part of some women\" in Koedt, A. \"The Myth of Vaginal Orgasm.\" \n \n in Koedt, A. & Levine, E. & Rapone, A., (eds.). (1973). \"Radical Feminism\". Quadrangle Books, New York, p204\n \n \n \n See also\n \n Kearnon, P. Man-Hating. \n \n also in Koedt, A. & Levine, E. & Rapone, A., (eds.). (1973). Radical Feminism. Quadrangle Books, New York.\n \n \n \n Where can you find the 'real' science?\n \n \n \n Again I find this a problem with science v religion. People are quite happy to believe that because there's lots of religions, none can be correct, and they happily believe in science as above all that, resting on 'empirical evidences' etc.",

Why are you in a debating forum when you refuse to debate?\n\n \n Post 261\n \n Simply saying \"no, you're wrong\" is not an argument. I may well be wrong, but I'm not going to take your word for it.\n\n \n I am moving to the conclusion that with Godel's Theorem, I am wrong (still pending further answers). This would not be the first, nor the last time.\n \n \nYou say science is biased, but when we say we know that, you post 500 lines showing bias being overcome as proof we're wrong, although you don't make it clear what we're wrong about. \n\n \n I show that biases are system-wide in science. It is an attempt to debunk a notion that an argument of science -v- religion is the same as an argument of objective truth -v- subjective truth, or rational thinking -v- non-rational thinking or any other generally anti-religious arguments people use here when they show no insight into understanding just how their own science comes about.\n \n Perhaps this criticism is because I am giving too much information that backs up the case for system-wide bias in science. I have thus limited myself to fewer quotes.\n \n \nYou continuously throw up smoke screens to try to hide that fact that you know your religion doesn't explain the physical world as well as science does.\n\n \n There are many versions of science. I have shown bias at work; through smoke research. We can now all be wise after the fact and say 'we know smoking is harmful', but that's the beauty of science, it knows things in hindsight. Thus I used the idea of mobile-phones as proof of bias now at work; we can't say whether they do or don't cause tumours; not simply because research hasn't been conducted; research released by the phone companies are in no doubt that mobile phones are safe. Where is the science, and where is the economics-driven-science?\n \n \nYou continuously throw up smoke screens to try to hide that fact that you know your religion doesn't explain the physical world as well as science does.You're wrong. And you know you're wrong. Anyone who dances around a point as much as you do knows that it's a point that will defeat their arguments. So, once again, I ask: why are you here? Why are you in a debating forum when you refuse to debate?\n\n \n This depends on what you limit as the 'physical world'. If I suffer from back pain, science could suggest that it is psychosomatic. How would science be able to explain my pain better than I could? Is 'free will' real? I don't know of science arguments that explain it better than some religious people can.\n \n Science, not only can it not prove everything that is real, can't even describe everything that is real in the observable world.\n \n Education is a social process. Science education is too.\n \"Einstein (1950) said that everyday knowledge provides a huge store of useful metaphors and ideas. From these, the scientist makes a free selection of a set of axioms, and thereupon begins constructing a theory. Einstein thought the origin of his theory might relate to a childlike exploration of space, and consulted with Piaget on the possible similarities between his personal intellectual development and that of children (Miller, 1986). In analyzing the work of other scientists, philosophers (Black, 1962; Kuhn 1970; Toulmin, 1972) and historians (Miller 1986, Nercessian 1988) emphasize that science is a constructive activity. Its materials are drawn in part from the familiar images and metaphors of prior knowledge (Lightman, 1989, Miller, 1986).\"\n Learning in Interactive Environments: Prior Knowledge and New Experience at\n http://www.astc.org/resource/educator/priorknw.htm\n \n Education is a social process. Biases are in-built into any such process.\n \n \"Social constructivism characterises the nature of knowledge to include the following: (1) knowledge is not a passive commodity to be transferred from a teacher to learners, (2) pupils cannot and should not be made to absorb knowledge in a spongy fashion, (3) knowledge cannot exist separate from the knower, (4) learning is a social process mediated by the learner's environment, and (5) the prior or indigenous knowledge of the learner is of significance in accomplishing the construction of meaning in a new situation. All learning is mediated by culture and takes place in a social context.\"\n \"Transcending Cultural Borders: Implications for Science Teaching\" at\n http://www.usask.ca/education/people/aikenhead/RSTE.htm\n \n That's at the beginning, when we acquire science knowledge.... at the other end, biases occur, even in the choosing of which projects are chosen for funding. Often that bias is not even based on 'worth'.\n See \"Evaluation and Adjudication of Research Proposals: Vagaries and Politics of Funding\"\n http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs-texte/3-02/3-02roth-e.htm\n \n Thus when the question is asked \"Where does science say we come from?\" my question is \"Which science?\"",

You're starting to squabble about what \"physical world\" means, which makes me fear that next you'll ask what the definition of \"is\" is. \n\n \n Kronus; you seem a little angry. I'm not squabbling about the 'natural world'. I know that my religion tells me about things that really exist; love/hate, grace, sin, etc. Even man's great purpose in life is explained. I know that science doesn't touch these things, it can't. The reason I dwell on the idea of 'natural' world, because I fear that you're going to adjudge anything that can't be measured by science as not 'natural'; viz. 'love' etc. You go on about science being this great describer, but it's of such a limited scope. Man is far more then chemicals interacting...\n \n \"Your joys and your sorrows, your memories and ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behaviour of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules\"\n - Francis Crick (quoted in Carroll, V, & Shiflett, D \"Christianity on Trial\", p83).\n \n Science reduces us to almost nothingness. Tell me how you think that science is better when all it can do is use a tape-measure to give a two dimensional account of a world inhabited with love, art, truth, honesty etc?\n \n \n However, you have yet to say anything about why your religion has any credibility when describing the physical world at all. Unless your church was founded by some scientific order of monks and you neglected to mention this, I don't see anything that would make me believe that the founders of your church knew anything about how the world works in a physical sense.\n\n \n I have stated that my church does not base itself on the limiting constraints of science. While some people are out there measuring the dimensions of a square, Orthodox contemplate much more meaningful things. If anything, this is why I'm not a creationist (because this word has the context of someone using science to debunk evolution).\n \n I note too you argued that I am wrong, that everyone on this thread seems to be aware of some truth; but I, alone can not. Simply ignoring the many sources I've cited; re: the bias of science, the social process of (science) education, etc is a comforting thing for some; such as the notion that the science you follow [i]is]/i] science.\n \n \n The Bible's a great book if you want to study philosophy, ethics, or spirituality, but it's not a science textbook.\n\n \n No kidding?\n \n \nIt says almost nothing about physics, chemistry, or biology. Those simply aren't fields of study that religion addresses. Why, then, do you insist that religion is not only a good tool for studying these fields, but the only acceptable one?\n\n \n I don't say that religion is the best for judging the speed of an apple falling. I said, and you seem to have missed this too, that science is great for little things such as producing a really new cool stereo system etc, but the ultimate destiny of man isn't dependent upon who has the most gadgets. The ultimate trip is back to God. I like science when it gives me a new computer game, or a new cure for a disease (that it probably created). All these are nice pursuits, but they don't get you closer to God.\n \n However, the problem lies when some people seek to use science for an all-encompassing belief system (usually the less you accept God, the more you need science as an 'alternative' to explaining things). Science is limited. And those that hold it up above religion ignore not only that whole world that exists that is beyond the grasp of science, but they also fail to recognise that not only can science not tell you with certainty about anything, but that there is more than one version of science going around.\n \n And yet people dare compare it to the truth of God! Where does science say we come from? Which version of science would you couch your answers in?\n \n \n \n I would like to take note for a moment of the anti-religious sentiment I see on the net, not necessarily just that on these threads. This sentiment is spouted by so-called 'free thinkers' and 'rationalists'. There are some who are so anti-religious that they believe it is the germ of all the world's evils; even recent terror attacks!\n \n \"Since the Renaissance the natural trend toward political and economic liberty has been resisted by three kinds of forces: tyranny, whether monarchic, autocratic, plutocratic, or ethnic; economic securitarianism, manifested as socialism and communism; and moral securitarianism, driven by fideist religion.\" \n http://humanknowledge.net/Thoughts.html#Volition \n \n Worse, still... the Christian religion is not just seen as a brake to freedoms, but an actual actor against society... \n \"If you have previously been inclined to support the cause of AiG, now is the time to reconsider. Muslim fundamentalism killed thousands in New York and Washington. It's another kind of twisted Christian Fundamentalism that advocates the assassination of Abortionists (another evil caused by Evolution, by the way), or the Oklahoma City bombing.\" \n http://home.austarnet.com.au/stear/...d_terrorism.htm\n \n A leading evolutionist, R. Dawkins says \"Religion is also, of course, the underlying source of the divisiveness in the Middle East which motivated the use of this deadly weapon in the first place (referring to the September 11 attacks). But that is another story and not my concern here. My concern here is with the weapon itself. To fill a world with religion, or religions of the Abrahamic kind, is like littering the streets with loaded guns. Do not be surprised if they are used.\" \n http://www.royal-ts.de/mtarchives/000328.php",

Isn't it interesting that all these religions have a different perspective on man's purpose in life?

It is certainly understandable that they would wish to do so. But out of the millions of interpretations that individuals apply to the meaning of life, how do we know which one is the 'right' one? Is it possible that there isn't really a 'right' one?\n \n Consider Orthodoxy for a moment. That religion goes back many centuries. Back to a time when a person called Jesus, The Christ, allegedly walked on this earth. (And He very well may have...) This person allegedly had both a divine and human nature. This person allegedly came to fulfill the Jewish prophecies of a savior, to free humanity from sin and bring humanity to God. But let's look back even farther...\n \n The concept of a Savior is only necessary if there is something to be saved from, right? What is it that this Savior was saving us from? Sin and eternal death, am I correct? But what is sin? When did this concept enter the minds of humanity? The Bible tells us it happened when Adam and Eve ate the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, against the wishes of God. When a few individuals placed themselves above all other creation and believed that they knew better than God what was good and what was evil. Doesn't the Bible indicate that such knowledge is the knowledge of God, and not of humanity? Why, then do individual humans continue to believe that they can know what is good and what is evil? Isn't that what God forbade Adam and Eve to do?\n \n What about prior to Adam and Eve? What happened then? Well, here's where there is a big disconnect between various interpretations of various religions and actual human history. By observing objective evidence, we are able to determine that humanity has been around longer than the approximately 6,000 years as indicated by a more literal interpretation of Genesis. So, is it not conceivable, then, that the concepts of good and evil... and therefore the concept of sin... and therefore the need for a Savior... all entered into the realm of human existence sometime around 6,000 - 10,000 years ago? That's really where the roots of Orthodoxy (or any other Salvationist religion) lie, right?\n \n I think when I started this post... I actually had a point. I'm not sure what it was now. Perhaps just to encourage you to consider the world from a perspective other than the one you now hold. Even for just a moment or two. Consider that Orthodoxy can be traced back no more than 10,000 years or so to the time when the concepts of sin and good and evil came to be. Yet humanity extends back many thousands of years prior to that. Or even hundreds of thousands or millions of years, depending on what you want to consider humanity.",

(DICKERSON, R.E. (September, 1978) Chemical Evolution and The Origin of Life. Scientific American, p.73).

Science never, ever claimed to have all the answers. Science never placed itself above religion.\n\n \n I am not anti-science per se. I am against people who argue from the position that there is only one science, and believe that religion is in part undermined because there are very many variations of faiths. There are many variations of science, too.\n \n Besides, atheists place science at the apex of explanatory systems. It is not necessary to be an atheist, but if you are one, you probably rely on science to explain how we 'are'.\n \n \n Science doesn't address love, God, art, etc not because it thinks these things unimportant, but because it knows that these things are outside its realm of expertise.

You also seem to recognise that science 'has its place'. But most try to use science to explain things that are already explained by Christianity; the origins of the earth, etc.\n \n But, getting back to the 'where does science say we come from?' question, and I hinted my direction with my first quote...\n \n 'The problem of the origin of life has turned out to be much more difficult than I, and most other people, envisioned.'\n HORGAN, J. (February, 1991) In The Beginning. Scientific American, p.117\n \n Where does science say we come from? I have asked 'which science?'\n \n Let's just look at different ideas that science coughs up...\n \n One of these is Panspermia.\n \n Panspermia is the idea that life came from outer space. As with all theories this too is not homogenous. There's a general panspermia theory, and a 'directed' panspermia theory. The former is a belief that life came here by random chance, such as on a meteor. The later is that life came here at the behest of an intelligence - such as aliens directing ships to earth laden with the molecules of life.\n \n The building blocks of life \" Bakes said nitrogenated aromatics exist throughout the Milky Way galaxy.\" http://www.spacedaily.com/news/life-04zw.html\n \n Other theories:\n \"OPARIN HYPOTHESIS ON THE ORIGIN OF LIFE\n According to Oparin, origin of life was a gradual process and that life did not come into existence suddenly as a consequence of a combination of a whole series of chance occurrences. Here we shall describe in detail the A.I.Oparin hypothesis according to his book ?The Origin of Life? especially his Coacervate model. Coacervate is a solution of high molecular weight chemicals i.e. Carbohydrates and proteins, etc. During various mechanisms of polymerization and condensation which were going to in the ocean water, a particular phenomenon of Cocervation took place, which according to Oparin, led to the origin of life. According to this, as a result of mixing of two different colloid solutions, some microscopic droplets become separated from them called as Coacervate (from Latin word acervus meaning pile). These droplets (Coacervates) contain almost all the Colloidal particles in specific ration and having the peculiar property of not allowing their drops (though saturated with liquid and water) to mix with surrounding water solution. The same property is exhibited by the protoplasm of Colloidal nature. Oparin considered these Coacervates as the sole living molecules which gave rise to the life. (14)\"\n http://www.hssrd.org/journal/summer2002/origin.htm\n \n \"COMPLEXITY THEORY \n Stuart Kauffman, a theoretical biologist at the Sante Fe Institute, has put forth the idea that when the necessary elements of the cell formed in the primordial soup (nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids), they were instantaneously integrated into a system, a system which we know as the cell (Cohen, 1996). Kauffman says this was not due to a miracle or chance, but was bound to occur. He rejects other scientists' need to find some sort of genetic carrier like RNA or DNA, or even an aperiodic solid, saying that the life forms may have had no need for them. (An aperiodic solid is one in which the atoms are arranged in some non-repeatable geometric pattern, such as a helix, that would allow for the variation within the structure that is necessary for genetic material). He believes that such genetic carriers could have evolved after the new life was already flourishing. Kauffman has even designed a computer model that shows that when a few organic molecules have developed some catalytic skills and reach the necessary level of diversity, then they spontaneously form an \"autocatalytic set\" (a life form). His theory is based on the general complexity theory, which states that when a system reaches some critical level of complexity, it will naturally produce a degree of complex order (4).\"\n http://www.lifesci.utexas.edu/courses/mcmurry/spring98/22/JENNIFER.html\n \n A. G. Cairns-Smith's Callisto Theory: That life began from a type of living-clay\n Richard Dawkins says of this \"Cairns-Smith believes that the original life on this planet was based on self-replicating inorganic crystals such as silicates. If this is true, organic replicators, and eventually DNA, must later have taken over or usurped the role.\"\n http://originoflife.net/cairns_smith/\n \n \"Other Theories\n In spite of the intense level of work on the RNA world in the last decade, there is no true consensus theory for precellular life. There are many theories. Here are some of the others ?\n A few scientists still say that DNA could succeed in starting life on its way (11). But even the shortest DNA strand needs proteins to help it replicate. This is the chicken-and-egg problem. \n There is a \"proteins first\" school. For example, Manfred Eigen of Germany's Max Planck Institute says, \"There is no doubt that proteins, which are more easily formed, were first on the scene\" (11.5). Of course, these first proteins must be much shorter than any used in life today, because of the sheer unlikelihood of forming useful long ones out of a soup of amino acids. \n Physicist Freeman Dyson proposes to solve the chicken-and-egg problem with a double origin, one for metabolism (proteins) and one for replication (strands of nucleotides) (12). \n In Seven Clues to the Origin of Life (13), A. G. Cairns-Smith says that clay crystals could have served as the scaffolding upon which the first short DNA or RNA genome was constructed. A new elaboration of this idea prompted one writer to wonder, \"Primordial soup or cr\u00eapes?\" (14). Even more recently, another tangent on this path leads to zeolite (14.5). \n Biologists Harold J. Morowitz (15), David Deamer (16), and others (17), advocate a theory that could be paraphrased as \"containers first.\" \n Jeffrey L. Bada of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography holds the minority view that the early Earth was frozen and believes precellular life started in \"cold soup\" under the ice (18, 19). \n Chemists Claudia Huber and G\u00fcnter W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user say the soup where life originated was actually quite hot, probably, near undersea volcanic vents, where iron and nickel sulfides might catalyze some of the necessary reactions (19.5-19.7). \n Cornell Astronomer Thomas Gold wonders if life might have originated in a hot environment even deeper, in Earth's crust (19.8). \n Stuart Kauffman of the Santa Fe Institute, says, \"...whenever a collection of molecules contains enough different kinds of molecules, a metabolism will crystallize from the broth\" (20). \n Another idea is the \"PNA world.\" Because starting the RNA world is so difficult, there probably needs to be a pre-RNA world. PNA, or peptide nucleic acid, might have some of the properties necessary to constitute that world (21). This would be pre-precellular life.\"\n http://www.panspermia.org/rnaworld.htm\n \n In conclusion; as with all my previous posts I've endeavoured to show that this issue isn't one of homogenous science -v- a plethora of religions. There are in all manner of scientific fields divers competing theories.",

We see that each has the molars modifed so that the cusps form sharp, shearing edges. We can show how these \"carnassals\" evolved by gradual modification of existing teeth used to grind vegetable matter. But the thylacine has the marsupial dental formula.\n \n These two animals converged on the same solution to the same problem; efficient shearing of meat into edible chunks.\n \n Take a look at the shark and dolphin. Their superficial similarity is due to the selective pressure caused by the need to move swiftly in water. Streamlining was convergently evolved several times in living things. But notice that the shark's solution for mobility was side-to-side motion. This was imposed by the basic muscle layout of the first chordates. But the cetaceans were evolved from land animals. And having descended from reptiles which had evolved an upright posture, the ancestors of whales had a galloping motion. This was adapted to water in and up-and-down motion similar to that seen in otters today.\n \n Again, evolutionary theory has no difficulty with this sort of evolution. Indeed, there is no other theory that can explain such development.\n \n Perhaps I'll work on some of the others, later.",

   " Then you admit that science isn't the best system for explaining things natural; unless you believe that 'love' is not 'natural'. You also seem to recognise that science 'has its place'. But most try to use science to explain things that are already explained by Christianity; the origins of the earth, etc.\n\n \n \"things natural\" ? It's phrases like that that end up being the center of lots of stupid debates here. I said science is good for explaining the physical universe. That's a very precise and well defined phrase. Why do you feel the need to change my words to something different? \"things natural\" is a vauge, broad category, which is why I wouldn't, and didn't, use it in this context. \n \n And yes, science has its place, but so does Christianity. And Christianity's place is not explaining physical phenomema. Just becasue people have already misused religion to try to explain things doesn't mean that science shouldn't try to set things right. That's like saying just because you tried to drive a nail with a screwdriver I shouldn't finish the job right with a hammer.",
