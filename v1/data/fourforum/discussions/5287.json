   "1) When Darwin first suggested evolution, he was applying on the basis of \"survival of the fittiest\" and how species tend to \"evolutionate\" from one another....however none of his arguements were that human came from apes and bacteria.\nDarwin was fully aware that evolution through natural selection implied that humans and apes had a common ancestor. He just chickened out of saying it when he first published.\n \n \n \n2) Then u might ask, how did the idea of ape becoming human occured? it happen when some oberservation of teh human structure couple thousand year ago: the long hand, the hairy body, the bent back, the walk on four legs and stuff like that....however no1 even was able to explained logically, they all pointed to apes...\nNever heard this before. Do you have any references?\n \n \n3) Here are the reasons that justify the structure of our ancestor: The survibal of the fittiest has always exited, but it doesnt lead to evolution, it leads to life cycle, the stronger eats the weaker. And so those with 'hair' would have a better chance surviving teh winter than those that didn't. It is also true that a human would walk or run faster if they are on 4 feet, so it was an instinct of survival and not a choice.\nThis makes no sense. Natural selection (poorly labeled by the tautology of \"survival of the fittest\") inherently leads to evolution. It can do nothing else. You are aware, are you not, that humans evolved in Africa? Africa is not exactly noted for it's cold winters, so I don't understand your hair argument therefore.\n \n \n4) the reason for the long hands would b that they didnt have any technology or equipments with them, no shovel, no bucket, no knife and etc....which meant they use their hand for everything, digging, carrying rocks, walking and etc...the reason for the bent back is they didn't have chairs or bed that would straight out ur collumn nor did they knew any better.\nOh dear. Have you ever looked at a human spine? It is curved: it's bent. A straight spine is a knackered spine. As to the hands bit, what are you on about? You are aware I hope that the story that the nosey elephant got it's trunk because a crocodile grabbed the end and stretched it is just a story?\n \n \n5) Moving on, if we look teh other way, evolution is actually a theory not physically proven, one of it s theory suggested that human started out in Africa while another in Asia, but if u look at them none resembles the other and none have a characteristic of an animal. \nScientific theories cannot be proven, Gravity has never been proven. I do not understand the rest. You appear to be suggesting that people from Asia and people from Africa do not resemble each other. Is that right? Also they apparently do not eat, sleep, defecate, urinate, mate, fight, play etc as they have no characteristics of an animal. Humans are animals.\n \n \n6) Evolution takes a long time, and humans havent been much on earth, there isn't enought time from for a human to evolve from a chipamzee to all kinds of different races with different characteristic\nLots of evolution requires a long time. Viruses happily get on with evolving over timespans of days and weeks.\n \n \n7) One point that my partner brought out was that if evolution really existed then why there isn't any \"evolutions\" happening now?\nIt is happening now. It's happening all around you.\n \n \n8) It is true that human created God to justify their existance and to apply laws to the people so they would fear doing anytjing they would please that would disrupt the harmony in a place, however, if religion didnt exist we all be running wild and limitless...\nAre clearly ants, bees and wasps must have religions and have created gods to justify their existance too.

   "1) When Darwin first suggested evolution, he was applying on the basis of \"survival of the fittiest\" and how species tend to \"evolutionate\" from one another....however none of his arguements were that human came from apes and bacteria.\n\n Actually, Darwin didn't like the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" applied to his theory. The phrase was actually coined by sociologist Herbert Spencer in the statement of his social theories. Darwin's preferred phrase was \"natural selection\" and used the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" only after it had become popular and Alfred Wallace (a Christian turned spiritualist) convinced Darwin that he would avoid confusion by using it. If one wants to reduce the hundreds of pages of theory that Darwin wrote to a single sound bite, \"differential reproductive success\" is probably the best. Further, natural selection was a proposed mechanism to explain the observed divergence of species.\n \n Darwin was quite aware of the implications of his theory for mankind from the beginning. He was also aware that it would be unpopular with the Church and the religious so he didn't mention it in On the Origin of Species. He waited until the theories expressed in that book had become generally accepted in the scientific community and then published The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex. In the later book Darwin did argue that mankind shared a common ancestor with apes.\n \n2) Then u might ask, how did the idea of ape becoming human occured? it happen when some oberservation of teh human structure couple thousand year ago: the long hand, the hairy body, the bent back, the walk on four legs and stuff like that....however no1 even was able to explained logically, they all pointed to apes...\nActually, I don't ask how the idea occurred. As I mentioned, Darwin suggested it. I'm not sure what the rese of that paragraph means.\n \n3) Here are the reasons that justify the structure of our ancestor: The survibal of the fittiest has always exited, but it doesnt lead to evolution, it leads to life cycle, the stronger eats the weaker. And so those with 'hair' would have a better chance surviving teh winter than those that didn't. It is also true that a human would walk or run faster if they are on 4 feet, so it was an instinct of survival and not a choice.\n\n What? \"Survibal of the fittiest\" leads to \"life cycle?\" What is that supposed to mean? And if the stronger eat the weaker, how does hair contribute to that? In fact, rarely in any species of primate do we see the stronger eating the weaker. As has already been pointed out, bipedalism is very efficient.\n \n4) the reason for the long hands would b that they didnt have any technology or equipments with them, no shovel, no bucket, no knife and etc....which meant they use their hand for everything, digging, carrying rocks, walking and etc...the reason for the bent back is they didn't have chairs or bed that would straight out ur collumn nor did they knew any better.\nWhere did you get that? Apes have hands that are good for climbing trees. And that bent back stuff is nonsense. The natural curvature of the upper spine in humans is called kyphotic curvature, and the curvature of the lower spine is called lordotic curvature.\n \n5) Moving on, if we look teh other way, evolution is actually a theory not physically proven, one of it s theory suggested that human started out in Africa while another in Asia, but if u look at them none resembles the other and none have a characteristic of an animal.\nAnd of course, the theory of gravity isn't \"physically\" proven either. Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease. However, evolution has been observed to occur and the current theories are the best explanations that we have for the observations. As far as your mangling of the \"Out of Africa\" theory, it would be nice if you actually learned what you are talking about before you babble such nonsense.\n \n6) Evolution takes a long time, and humans havent been much on earth, there isn't enought time from for a human to evolve from a chipamzee to all kinds of different races with different characteristic\n\n What is that supposed to mean? Humans didn't evolve from a \"chipamzee\". Humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor, probably about 7 million years ago. That is plenty of time for the observed divergence between the two species to have occurred.\n \n7) One point that my partner brought out was that if evolution really existed then why there isn't any \"evolutions\" happening now?\nPerhaps your partner didn't bother to invest enough effort to learn what he was talking about before he spoke. Seems typical in your partnership.\n \n8) It is true that human created God to justify their existance and to apply laws to the people so they would fear doing anytjing they would please that would disrupt the harmony in a place, however, if religion didnt exist we all be running wild and limitless...\nI doubt it.\n \nUmm i think that long enough, i will add more points after discussing those \nYou've got more? Is it as mindless as this batch?",

   "Sry I havent reply earlier, I was really busy...thnx for ur patience.\n \n For Mucusaur....I really didn't proofread so of coarse there is gonna be lots mistakes...survival of the fittest*, chimpanzees*, the*;...satisfy?\n \n So basically let me clarify my points before moving on...\n \n -The DARWIN theory of evolution suggested that all living organism came from a common ancestor also that one species tend to evolve from another. I never said that human evolved from chimpanzees, but they evolved from the same class, Ape-like. The theory of evolution suggested that human are actually animals, much like the chimp and all its characteristic....however my points above was trying to show that we are nothing alike. The 90% + similarity of DNA between the two species dont mean much. DNA carries the instructions for making all the structures and materials the body needs to function. They look like us doesnt necessary means that they are in some way part of us.\n \n Gravity hasnt been physically proven, however it has been proven in the sense that we can see it happening. Whan Newton, i think, went to the top of the building and released two different mass of object and they landed at the same time, that can b a prove to his theory.\n \n For Clive.... Africa a couple millions year ago wasn't the same place it was now, as a matter of fact it contain huge body of water and it was a cold place. \n \n Another thing, this suppose to b a debate, so try to explain ur arguments instead of saying just BS.\n \n I'll try to reach u guys from another point. Here are some flaws for evolution that i found.\n \n \n 1. Evolution has never been observed. \n 2. Evolution violates the 2nd law of thermodynamics. \n 3. There are no transitional fossils. \n 4. Evolution is only a theory; it hasn't been proved. \n \n Biologists define evolution as a change in the gene pool of a population over time. And that period of time takes thousands and thousands of years, and we haven't really observed a \"true\" evolution. And again that falls why evolution is just a theory, unlike gravity and all it has never been proven, natural selection is part of teh life cycle and not evolution. Evolution of man accoring to evolution has occured in the last 7 million years, but we havent started recording history in paper almost 2 thousand years ago. \n \n The second law of thermodynamics says, \"No process is possible in which the sole result is the transfer of energy from a cooler to a hotter body.\" [Atkins, 1984, The Second Law] . In other words \"The entropy of a closed system cannot decrease.\" Entropy is an indication of unusable energy corresponds to intuitive notions of disorder or randomness. Now you may be scratching your head wondering what this has to do with evolution. Evolution states that once we are animals, unorganized, disordered, and now we're civilized more intelligent and etc...violating the second law of thermodynamics. If u taken chemistry this would b easier to understand.\n \n One argument that could b used in point 1. is the use of fossils . However, the discoveries has never showed transitional fossils. A transitional fossil is the fossil remains of a creature that exhibits primitive traits in comparison with the more derived life-forms it is related to. However, the discovery of discovery of Archaeopteryx and some other fossils contains too many gaps to actually b taken as true by all creationist, since it is not \"hard\" evidence.\n \n Another thing, along time ago i came cross with this (i put up the references later), if we gonna talk about Darwin's theory of evolution, didnt he once said that \"if my theory can not be proven during a certian period of time, then it should be discarded\". And his theory wasn't brought it until later after that certain period of time. So actually Darwin's theory shouldn;t even be looked at.\n \n And did you know that Homo sapiens sapiens had brains that averaged 1450cc, about 8% larger than modern man. The thing we must remember is that africanus had a 450cc brain. We now have a 1350cc brain. That africanus brain is still in there (since we still act like them in some ways). I can understand the increase of the brain thru evolution. But then if evolution suggests that the better will always prevail, why did the homo sapiens sapiens genes, which shows superiority, extinguished? AND late evidence in a study of the DNA from fossil remains seem to indicate that the neandertal was not assimilated into the gene pool of modern man. Umm i wonder what happen to evolution there.\n \n PS: Again, i will apologize if there is any mistake. However, if my points have fail to disprove evolution then i'll take consideration of beleiving in evolution.",

   " Sry I havent reply earlier, I was really busy...thnx for ur patience.\n No problem, at least you admit that you would be willing to change your belief. Hope we can hold you to that ;)\n \n \n\n -The DARWIN theory of evolution suggested that all living organism came from a common ancestor also that one species tend to evolve from another. I never said that human evolved from chimpanzees, but they evolved from the same class, Ape-like. The theory of evolution suggested that human are actually animals, much like the chimp and all its characteristic....however my points above was trying to show that we are nothing alike. The 90% + similarity of DNA between the two species dont mean much. DNA carries the instructions for making all the structures and materials the body needs to function. They look like us doesnt necessary means that they are in some way part of us.\n However DNA appears to be strongly conserved between organism in areas essential to life, whilst those less important are more different. This strongly hints that these differences have occured over time. Not to mention that if you compare the DNA of two species and then relate this to the rate of mutation over time you end up with a date for a common ancestor being very similar to the age of the fossils of the apparent common ancestor (though I'll admit now that DNA dating tends to give older dates, though this is not that far out and would be expected as not only are fossils fairly rare given the time species exist for, but mutations occur before they are able to be selected for)\n \n \n\n Gravity hasnt been physically proven, however it has been proven in the sense that we can see it happening. Whan Newton, i think, went to the top of the building and released two different mass of object and they landed at the same time, that can b a prove to his theory.\n Actually they did it on the moon as air resistance causes Newton's theories to have problems, but hey. We see evolution happening - the best case if that of the black backed and herring gulls, though in this case its a similar thing over space rather than time. In western europe there are two species of gulls, they do not breed nor are compatable if artificially inseminated. However as you travel around the northern hemisphere the two species gradually become more alike until on the opposite side of the world they are indistinguishable. How is it so hard to see this happening over time as well? Other similar examples are mosquitoes that have adapted to feed of rats in the london underground and mulberry bush insects that have adapted to different plants and are unable to lay larvae on the original plant. This combined with the DNA evidence pretty much shows that evolution can happen over a long period of time to scales far beyond just breeds of dog or suchlike.\n \n \n \n\n Biologists define evolution as a change in the gene pool of a population over time. And that period of time takes thousands and thousands of years, and we haven't really observed a \"true\" evolution. And again that falls why evolution is just a theory, unlike gravity and all it has never been proven, natural selection is part of teh life cycle and not evolution. Evolution of man accoring to evolution has occured in the last 7 million years, but we havent started recording history in paper almost 2 thousand years ago. \n\n \n 1. Yes it has, if you mean macroevolution over millions of years then...well kind of, however observed is not really the same here. We see the results which is all we would see if we carried out an experiment in the lab (infact for evolution we have far more information than if we just carried out a chemical experiment in the lab). If you demand that people must see the thing happening directly, then nothing you can see is real even. The only way I know you exist is that you have posted something that I can see, same for evolution. \n \n \n\n The second law of thermodynamics says, \"No process is possible in which the sole result is the transfer of energy from a cooler to a hotter body.\" [Atkins, 1984, The Second Law] . In other words \"The entropy of a closed system cannot decrease.\" Entropy is an indication of unusable energy corresponds to intuitive notions of disorder or randomness. Now you may be scratching your head wondering what this has to do with evolution. Evolution states that once we are animals, unorganized, disordered, and now we're civilized more intelligent and etc...violating the second law of thermodynamics. If u taken chemistry this would b easier to understand. \n Trouble is, a lot of creationism's fiercest supporters get a lot of money from telling people evolution doesn't exist and even when they have why they are wrong explained to them, they don't bother changing what they say. This is a classic case of this - looks on the surface like a massive flaw with evolution and is touted by many creationsist promoters. However there is one thing that completely destroys this line of argument - the biosphere is not a close system. Heat from the sun and other reactions provides energy needed to break free from the 2nd law, without energy disorder increases and we end up dying - but if you replace the energy and materials required for those reactions you can keep order going. \n \n \n\n One argument that could b used in point 1. is the use of fossils . However, the discoveries has never showed transitional fossils. A transitional fossil is the fossil remains of a creature that exhibits primitive traits in comparison with the more derived life-forms it is related to. However, the discovery of discovery of Archaeopteryx and some other fossils contains too many gaps to actually b taken as true by all creationist, since it is not \"hard\" evidence.\n There is a complete sequence for whale evolution more or less, not to mention the idea of a transititional fossil is flawed as there is no real defintion of species - and the common definition of species changes as you move from fossils and bones to living creatures. Clearly a dead thing can't breed, so that rules out the normal method, the rest is just down to morphology. There are massive amounts of fossils that show relationship with others - all vertebrates have the same basic pattern for their limbs, whales and some snakes have the remenants of hind limbs within their bodies (don't be confused by the counter arguement that these are used for reproduction, whilst dolphins and some of the smaller whales may use them for grasping a mate, its well beyond the ability of larger whales to do so, yet they still have them).\n \n\n Another thing, along time ago i came cross with this (i put up the references later), if we gonna talk about Darwin's theory of evolution, didnt he once said that \"if my theory can not be proven during a certian period of time, then it should be discarded\". And his theory wasn't brought it until later after that certain period of time. So actually Darwin's theory shouldn;t even be looked at.\n We have tons of proof, at the very least enough that its really still worth looking at, Creationism has had 4000 years plus to offer some real scientific proof yet has failed to do so. Evolution has proof, but apparently not enough for some people - still don't you think we can afford some more time for it even for them?\n \n\n And did you know that Homo sapiens sapiens had brains that averaged 1450cc, about 8% larger than modern man. The thing we must remember is that africanus had a 450cc brain. We now have a 1350cc brain. That africanus brain is still in there (since we still act like them in some ways). I can understand the increase of the brain thru evolution. But then if evolution suggests that the better will always prevail, why did the homo sapiens sapiens genes, which shows superiority, extinguished? AND late evidence in a study of the DNA from fossil remains seem to indicate that the neandertal was not assimilated into the gene pool of modern man. Umm i wonder what happen to evolution there.\n Think you might be getting very confused here, and mistyped some of the numbers (I assume that you ment africanus had a 1450 brain?).\n However even with us there is more at stake than brain power (on the surface bigger brains appear a disadvantage due to the energy it takes to feed it and the fact that you need to be born more prematurally to get the head out). We are homo sapiens sapiens anyway you realise? The exinction of Neanderthals isn't about evolution but paleontology, its interesting but hardly vital to evolution in anyway. As an aside, some very old poems and stories feature something that could resemble a neanderthal and could at a push explain the ideas about orcs in european myth. Not really the place for this and its a bit of a push..but hey, sounds cool ;)\n \n\n PS: Again, i will apologize if there is any mistake. However, if my points have fail to disprove evolution then i'll take consideration of beleiving in evolution.\n I hope we can hold you to this, just remember its good to remember that those for evolution don't really get paid for it - their field of research just happens to be providing proof (and they would be as interested as you in something that can replace evolution yet still explain the things it does) whilst those that cater to the creationist audience certainly get a great deal of money from seminars and books without really needing any of the credentials and evaluation that real science does. Beware people who tell you exactly what you want to hear and don't encourage you to ask questions",

   "Gravity hasnt been physically proven, however it has been proven in the sense that we can see it happening. Whan Newton, i think, went to the top of the building and released two different mass of object and they landed at the same time, that can b a prove to his theory.\n\n The main breakthrough that Newton brought about was to identify gravity as a force acting at a distance. Also, he was the first to realize (or at least the first to theorize) that the same force that pulls an apple to the ground and holds our feet to the Earth is the same force that causes the Earth and the planets to revolve arond the sun and the moon around the Earth. \n \n This is far from obvious by mere visual inspection of the bodies in the sky. \n \n We accept it now because it seems so obvious, especially after being taught these things in elementary school.\n \n Perhaps if we waited until high school to bring it up at all, there would be more anti-gravitationists. They might summon the pre-Newtonian explanation for why things fall to Earth, the Aristotelian explanation that bodies desired to once again be one with the Earth.\n \n And it was Gallileo that did the falling body experiment (actually he used balls on inclined planes) to demonstrate that the acceleration due to gravity did not depend on mass. This is actually false and Newton's Law of Gravitation (not the Law of Gravity, there is no such thing) shows that the gravitational force (and as a result the acceleration) depends on the masses of the two gravitating bodies in question.",

   "Biological evolution, the affect of natural selection upon non indentical organisms, occurs without question.
