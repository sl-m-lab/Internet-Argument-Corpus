How does not wanting to participate in the ridiculous war against Iraq which Cheney, Wolfowitz, and Perle were describing in detail a decade before 9/11 equate to some sort of betrayal? Iraq has not attacked the United States, or anyone for that matter in years. Iraq is not about to attack France, it can barely support its own population.\n \n Why the hell should France want to spend BILLIONS of dollars fighting in an absurd aggressive war to increase terrorism? I constantly hear prattling on about \"cheese eating surrender monkeys.\" That is quite frankly ridiculous. France lost an entire generation in World War 1, not to mention the toll it incurred in the Napoleonic Wars. France lost well over a 100,000 men in World War 2. French soldiers died for the very independence of the United States and again during the War of 1812 where Napoleon was the only thing that prevented Britain from crushing the United States, after burning down its capital, and after New England officially quit the War of 1812 and threatened to secede from the United States. France was occupied by the Third Reich, after being DESERTED by the Allies at Dunkirk, the surrender monkeys, whose next great action was to bomb the French Fleet in North Africa killing hundreds of French sailors! Try imagining 9/11 x 1,000,000,000 to try to grasp the utter devestation Europe experienced in the twentieth century. Germany lost MILLIONS of its citizens. Its economy, the entire nation was utterly erradicated by heavy allied bombing. America in its brainwashing program imposed upon Germany after the war is directly responsible for German pacifism today - the same is true of Japan. Russia lost tens of millions of its people in World War 2. Sorry, but the Europeans have a damn good reason not to rush off to war like the did with the enthusiasm of the Great War like the Yankees are doing today. France sold America literally half the United States with the Lousiania Purchase, the greatest fortune and piece of luck ever to befall a country in all of world history! Whereas Frederick the Great fought for seven years to gain Silesia, and two more wars to hold it; Napoleon and the \"cheese eating surrender monkeys\" emoticon_rolleyes fought for twenty years against six coalitions of Great Powers to control Western Europe; whereas England paid a son for every square mile of its Empire - America acquired an area the size of Western Europe itself for a pittance, because of France, this much reviled nation of all so evil cowards and America haters! The irony and arrogance of such a condescending attitude is utterly amazing!",

War- Mostly Lost.- France is saved at last by female schizophrenic who inadvertently give the rise to the 1st rule of French warfare: France's armies are victorious when not led by a Frenchman.\n Italian Wars- Lost.- France becomes the frist and only country to ever lose two wars when fighting Italians.\n Wars of Religion- France goes 1-5-4 against the Huguenots.\n 30 yrs. War- France is technically not a participant, but manages to get invaded anyway. Claimed a tie on the basis that eventually all the other participants started ignoring her.\n War of the Augsburg League/King William's War/French and Indian War- Lost, but claimed as a tie. Francophiles the world over label the period the height of French Militarty Power.\n War of Spanish Succession- Lost. The war also the the French their first tast of a Marlborough, which they have loved since.\n American Revolution- France claims a win even though the colinist saw far more action. This later known as \"de Gaulle syndrome,\"and leads to the 2nd rule of French Warfare: France only wins when America does most of the fighting.\n French Revolution- WON, becuase the opponent was also French.\n Napoleonic Wars-Lost. Temporary victories due to leadership of a Corsican (remember the 1st rule), who ended up being no match for a British footwear designer.\n Franco-Prussian War- Lost\n WW1- Tied and on the way to losing, France is saved by U.S.\n WW2- Lost. Conquered French liberated by the U.S. and Britain just as they finish learning the Horst Wessel Song.\n War in Indochina- Lost\n Algerian Rebellion- Lost. This marks the 1st defeat of a Western army by a non Turkic Muslim force since the Crusades, and produces the Frist rule of Muslim Warfare: We can always beat the French. This rule is identical to the first rules of the Italians, Russians, Germans, English, Dutch, Spanish, Vietnamese, and Eskimos.\n War on Terrorism- France, keeping in mind its recent history, surrenders to Germans and Muslims just to be safe.\n \n American Policy: Speak Softly and carry a big stick.\n French Policy : Speak Loudly and carry a white flag.",
