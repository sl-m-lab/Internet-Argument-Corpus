It saddens me to think some will reject it simpy because someone tells them to...Darwin isn't worshiped, and he wasn't an overnight success.

This is an interesting statement that just \"jumped out of the screen\" at me. Is not evolution an idea about how all the evidence came to be? Is it not an idea about why things are the way they are? \n \n Checkmate, you have just proved yourself wrong with one simple sentence. Evolution cannot be, as you state, defined as \"knowledge\" as it is an idea. You go on to state:\n There ARE things like \"faith\" and faith-based beliefs, but these things do not qualify as knowledge, and are not based on reason. Just as contradictions or false beliefs don't qualify as knowledge. \n \n Is not evolution a faith-based belief system about the past? No one observed the big bang occuring, no one observed life coming from non-life, and no one was present to observe life evolving from the simplier life forms. We also have no human eye-witness accounts, to make matters worse. Therefore, evolution must be taken as by faith, i.e. it is a faith-based belief. This by your own definition does not qualify as \"knowledge\". \n \n Why is it that so many people argue against science (such as biology-evolution, geology-age of earth, cosmology- big bang), without first accepting or rejecting what science is defined as? Why even argue about evolution, if the real objection is with the word \"science\", and \"knowledge\"?\n \n Your definition of science is a very simplifed one and IMHO, not a very good one. A much more accurate definition of \"science\" is as follows:\n Science is the human enterprise of seeking to describe accurately and quantitatively the nature and processes of our universe through observation, hypothesis, and experimental validation. \n \n By this definition, most parts of evolution (e.g. big bang theory, life from non-life and the evolution of life from simple to complex) does not qualify as \"science\" as it cannot be observed, repeated and it can't be tested experimentally. It then becomes a belief or faith-based system that according to you, cannot be knowledge. \n \n Therefore, we can conclude that teaching evolution is not teaching knowledge nor science, and as such, is teaching ignorance (defined as lack of knowledge).\n \n In any case, even the Pope is cool with evolution, it's not a bad word, and since religion doesn't rely on evidence, it CANNOT, by definition, disprove your god. \n \n I am personally saddened that the Pope would take the words of fallible man above the Word of God for whom he serves. Is this not putting man's word (who wasn't there) above God's Word (who was there)? I am just thankful that we have ministries like AiG and ICR who stand up for God's Word - The Bible - and defend it from the very first verse.\n \n It's kind of interesting, if you are being taught the topic of motion in science by your teacher, he/she may repeat the lesson so that his/her students will fully understand it and be able to answer any question that is thrown at them. In Genesis 1:26-27 we read:\n \n (26) Then God said, \"Let us make man in Our image, in Our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the Earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\" (27) So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female he created them. \n \n We are told three times that:\n God created man in His own image and that He created them.\n \n This is similar to the teacher trying to teach his/her students motion in science. He/she will repeat the lesson until he/she is confident that his/her class knows about the topic. In a similar way, God tells us three times that He created us in His image - He wants us to know that He created us in His image. \n \n If we want to make a point, we'll keep re-stating it - similar to what Mach did with his repitition of montalban's statement and what I have done several times. God does a similar thing here, He wants us to know that He created us in His own image, i.e. like Him.",

   "\"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\" - Theodosius Dobzhansky\n \nOrigin of speicies wouldn't be a good place to start, seeing as it doesn't really go into why evolution is so important to biology as that comes down to genetics and inheritance. Evolution is really just a result of the way DNA is inherited over time and because of this touchs parts of biology and threads the whole thing together.\n\n I agree and disagree.\n \n On The Origin Of Species is mostly of historical interest and would not be a good place to start. Darwin actually proposed several theories in his book, 5 according to Ernst Mayr. Each of these can be (and has been) considered, tested and verified on its own. But as you imply, Darwin had no knowledge of the mechanics of heredity. In any biology course the mechanics of heredity are covered in an early chapter, and in advanced studies, a course in genetics precedes a course in evolution.\n \n However, evolution is much more than just genetics and inheritance. It is more than just the way DNA in inherited over time. The definition of biological evolution is changes in the heritable makeup of populations over time. The theories of evolution explain why those changes take place. Some of those changes have to do with the way DNA is inherited, i.e., some mutations are mistakes in the duplication of chromosomes. And recombination certainly has to do with the inheritence of DNA. But gene flow is a different matter and has more to do with the movement of populations than with inheritence alone. Natural selection is defined as differential reproductive success, but is not about reproduction but the action of the environment on populations. I guess sexual selection could be said to be about how DNA is inherited since it deals with how various organisms choose their mates. Finally, genetic drift is random action whereby some characteristics are increased or decreased. This is true in small, isolated populations.\n \nMost modern biological research involves evolution to at least some degree, mainly though homology modelling - because we know that species are related and that they have evolved from a common ancestor you can look at similar genes in model orgnanisms (like mice, yeast or flatworms) and draw conclusions that will apply to humans.

   "are you joking? It's not short (500-600 pages depending on format). and it's only easy to read if you like reading that 19th century style of speech and writing that uses sentences more complicated than they need to be. It's not a tough read, mind you.\n \n I think Herman Melville is the extreme of what I'm talking about.\n\n OK. I found the book pretty easy going (but I'm used to reading 19th century texts): I think it gives a useful historical perspective on the subject - especially for someone who has no background in biological science and who would be daunted by a college textbook that has up to date readings on genetics and molecular biology.",
