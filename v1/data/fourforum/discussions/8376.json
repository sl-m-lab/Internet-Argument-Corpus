   "Godaskalice, heaven is not a real place that actual exists somewhere, and there is no good reason to believe that it is. Heaven is an irrational device used by religious thinkers to support their points of view. It works like this: when a religious person has an intuition that they wish to support they appeal to the authority of \"God\" by saying that god said it to be so, witch is accomplished by interpreting the bible, witch is a book wrongfully claimed to have been written by God. Normally, appealing to an authority is a logical fallacy, because even if something is true, its true for some reason, its not just true because somebody says it is (if I say there is a cup on my desk, that's true because there is a cup on my desk, not because I said there is). In the case of God though the religious thinker claims that God is a special authority that is absolutely creditable, meaning that we don't need to know the real reasons for things because we can always just trust God! Now, where heaven comes in, is when it comes to justifying God's credibility. Because I may ask: why should I believe that god is an absolutely credible source, why should I believe that god is all knowing and will never lie? There is just no reason to believe that no reason at all, if you are interested in what the truth is. So the religious thinker dose a very strange thing, the religious thinker says forget truth or falsehood, there is a greater reason to believe in something, beyond that it is true. This new motivation, that is more important than right or wrong, or true or false, is the concept of heaven and hell. The religious thinker believes in the absolute credibility of God not because there is any reason to believe in it, but out of fear of hell and hope for heaven. That is heavens purpose as an idea, its purpose as an idea is not to refer to an actual place. \n \n Now you may be thinking, hey - that doesn't make any sense, and you are quite right. It doesn't make any sense because there is no reason to believe in heaven and hell, beyond the claim of God, and if it is necessary to believe in heaven and hell to trust God, well then that's circular - a paradox. The real unfortunate thing is that people believe in heaven and hell out of the sheer power of the ideas, hell is very scary, and it makes people very afraid. If you grow up taking it seriously for your enter life, its very hard to just decide that it doesn't really exist and not be afraid of it anymore.

   "goaskalice - you are being dry-gulched. If you think that you can pose a question like that without taking heat, you're sadly mistaken.\n billsco mentioned that you should \"learn critical thinking skills\", and he's right. Before those of us that know that God is real can actually display some semblance of realism, we have to ask ourselves how well we can do it. Not so well is the answer and will always be the answer.\n How we live is a lot more telling than what we can put on paper or in a pub forum.\n \n Back to the topic.\n \n There are certain events/situations and such that we go through in life that have a tendency to cast us (form our character, shape our attitudes). The common misconception is that believers receive a certain portion of those events differently than nonbelievers, which is not so. Depending on how we deal with those situations we can develop an idea of what Heaven can be like in that respect (referring to emotions)...other than that no one knows.\n \n BTW - Other than earthly things (how to respond to particular questions; give opinions on Scripture, etc.), critical thinking does not apply. Logic loses its raison d'\u00eatre.",

   "I KNOW he's there, just from that one experience I felt when I was a kid, and also a few feelings I've had sitting in church. I really don't know how to exlpain it, maybe it's more of I know there's something up there. I believe in God, nothing will make me change my mind. He's just..there. How else are we to explain it?\n\n dont you see the dilema here? you believe that god exists because you had an experience, and you believe that the experience was a manifestation of god, because you had already believed that god exists. its very easy to find justification for what you already believe to be true. and that is the problem. you start off with a preconception, then assume that other things you experience are based on the notion you had in the first place. that type of mentality locks you in a loop: you only look for things to justify what you believe in, and when you find something that contradicts your belief, you block it out mentally. additionally, there's a constant supply of \"experiences\" that lead you to the notion you had in the first place, because you were already filtering everything you experience\n \n i think the fact that you posted the question concerning emotions in heaven is a good sign. you realise that loose ends and unanswered questions cannot be always plastered with \"just believe it without question\". youre questioning. beware of questions, they destroy religious beliefs",

There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 34 and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\" 35 Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. \n \n Luke 24:36 - While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\" 37 They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. 38 He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? 39 Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" \n \n John 20:16 - Jesus said to her, \"Mary.\" She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, \"Rabboni!\" (which means Teacher). 17 Jesus said, \"Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' \" 18 Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: \"I have seen the Lord!\" And she told them that he had said these things to her. \n \n John 20:19 - On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" 20 After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. \n \n John 20:26 - A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" 27 Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\" \n 28 Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\" \n \n 1 Corinthians 15:3 - For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. 6 After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, 8 and last of all he appeared to me also... \n \n Acts 1:1 - In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach 2 until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. 3 After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. 4 On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. \n \n 1 John 4:14 - And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. \n \n 2 Peter 1:16 - We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\n \n Luke 1:1 - Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3 Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. \n \n Matthew 28:5 - The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. 7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.\" 8 So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 Suddenly Jesus met them. \"Greetings,\" he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. \n \n \n You and EZ have both, also reasonably, asked me what might then constitute non-faith-based evidence. I could reply the evidence of my own eyes, but someone would get cute and point out that that too relies on faith that my eyes are reporting reality and my brain interpreting their input correctly, and the argument would descend into meaninglessness.I can only repeat: EZ claimed to have some non-faith-based evidence; let's see it.\n\n \n As Jesus taught in his parable, even if someone were raised from the dead you would still not believe. It's your mindset that's causing you issues. But Jesus can open your eyes and free you from that if you will start seeking him.",

However it is no more right and real then what another person feels who has a different belief then yours. Even if that belief includes no god at all. As long as you insist that you are RIGHT, you will have people telling how wrong you are. And it is very wrong to adopt a faith based belief and decide that it is RIGHT for everyone. Other peoples beliefs or non beliefs are just as legitimate as yours. Is it because other peoples beliefs can be proven? No, it's because they believe in them. That is what makes them true, maybe not to you, but true to the believer who happens to think so. American Indian spirituality was passed down by word of mouth. Nothing at all like the spirituality you are a part of, but no less meaningful or sacred to those that believe it to be true. The last thing the American Indians needed in their lives was Christianity and Christians. It cost them their beliefs, their traditions, their dignity, and what they once called home. Such has been the unfortunate fate of so many PAGAN nations over the years. The riteousness of Christianity by default disrespects and demeans all other beliefs. That in my opinion is terribly wrong. That is one of the many reasons why I am not a Christian. That has no bearing on you being a Christian.

   "Well I was sitting in my youth class last wed. night. We were talking about the book Revelation and a question suddenly popped in my head. Either this question really can't be proven or there is somewhere in the Bible that talks about it. \n Here's the question with some supporting detail:\n \n When we die and go to live with God in heaven, will we be able to posses certain emotions? I mean look at Lucifer. He was an angel, he was perfect. But there had to be something there, some kind of envy/jealousy that caused him to want to exceed the power of God. So then that ties in with angels being able to have free will. So when we go to heaven will we still have free will and emotions? And no, I'm not talking about the 1000 year reign, I'm talking about finally living in heaven.\n\n \n \n With all due respect to your question here, here is some advice from a old fart here. We all know what should be done with advice dont we ? :)\n \n Dedicate a whole LOT more time in getting your education for your career, so that you will have the survival skills needed to live in THIS world , and leave the mind numbing /altering facets of proofing the bible , to the monks. It is good to have the basic christian beliefs at a young age, they will lay a good foundation for you in having good attributes and treating people the way they should be treated in this world...\n \n Learn the Ten Commandments and excercise them in your daily life. Maintain your faith in Christ and belief in God, that faith in itself will be a positive force for you to help you through the troubled times awaiting you in life. With that faith, you will never be truly alone. Having these faiths will not be explainable to most, so do not try to force them on those that do not comprehend or want to. That fact of life does not take away the importance of you having your faith....\n \n When you start to gray in the hairline and have plenty of time on your hands, then get in to deep religious discussions and decipherings. You will have a better perspective on them then , because you will have many life experiences under your belt to help you find the answers to the unprovable questions like those discussions of the afterlife, heaven and hell. Those discussions cannot be made positive or provable using logic just as Orn said, because they are of spiritual nature, therefore not rational to the logistical or carnally minded. Just live life to the fullest, because it is SO short in the dimension of time itself. Good luck on your endeavors :)",

   "It is still an argument you present. Am I to assume that this is no argument? That you are not arguing against the existence of God? If so, then what is this activity in which we are engaging to be called?\n\n \n I hope that what we are engaging in is argument, but I still dispute that I was 'presenting a popular argument against God'. That would involve presenting positive evidence for god's non-existence, which is fundamentally impossible. It is equally impossible to present positive evidence for the tooth fairy's non-existence, but in the absence of evidence for its existence we assume non-existence.\n \n \nIt wasn't I that created these \"different nouns.\" They exist, and I must reconcile with them somehow. The way I choose to do so is not binding to you, nor is your way binding to me, hence the way atheism chooses to do so is no less silly than theism. This is my point.\n\n \n Hmm. You stated\n \n \nIf I believe that God is existence, then the two are inseparable\n\n \n Your believing that they are does not make them so for me. You are seeking to demonstrate an equivalence between our two positions ('...nor is your way binding to me'), but once more they are not equivalent. You are the one making the assertion that god = existence. This is not self-evidently true, so the burden of evidence is on you to substantiate that claim, not on me to demonstrate its falsehood.",

   "Georged: Mythology? Since when? When do historical events become myth? When you say so?\n \n johnhanks: The fact that existence=God is self evidently true to me, although it may not be to you. You believe it is self evident that they are not the same. Simply because there are two words in our language does not mean that they must be different, but merely that some believe them to be.\n \n billsco: From my understanding of Heaven, you would not be concerned with those in Hell because they are there due to the fact that they rejected God.\n \n I was doing a little reading on this, because it is an interesting topic at heart, I think, and found the following. If you bother to read it, you may not find religion to be so silly after all. It was obviously typed in haste, so be ware the spelling errors:\n \n \nGod is all knowing and He knows since the begining who are those who will go to heaven and those who will go to hell. \n We are however free, because God has chosen to create man with a free-will. He has chosen to create us with a free-will and He has the power to do that. There is no logical contradiction between our free-will and divine omniscience. Man is free to choose but God already knows what we will freely choose because time is only a human limit; God is out of time. Since we are finite, we can never fully understand God, His thoughts, His life. \n There is an abyss of superiority separating God from us. \n So our understanding of God's attribute, such as omniscience, omnipotence, etc. cannot be complete. \n \n \n Now I come to your question: \n \n If God knows everything, why did He create those souls who go to Hell? \n \n God loves us infinitely and He desires to lead each of us to the eternal life. But God is perfectly Holy and Good; God cannot tolerate evil because evil is uncompatible with His good and holy nature. \n So, we cannot go to heaven as long as we are not completely purified from our sins and sanctified. \n Our sanctifcation is necessary for us to go to heaven. \n God desires to sanctify us, but He has given us a free-will, so God needs our consent in order to purify and sanctify us. God respects our choices and therefore God cannot santify those who do not want to be sanctified and purified, those who do not want to stop sinning, those who do not want to live a holy life. \n These are those who go to hell. \n But why Hell? \n I believe that the fear of eternal damnation and the other penalties threatening the sinner can initiate an interior process which, under the prompting of grace, will yield a true and deep love for God. \n God knows that the fear of eternal punishment is sometimes the only means to induce some sinners to repentance and conversion. So the salvation of these souls justifies the eternal punishment of those souls who refuse to repent and be converted. In other words, without an eternal punishment, fewer souls would be saved. \n Therefore the existence of an eternal suffering in Hell is justified as an instrument to induce more men to repent and therefore be saved. \n \n I hope this may help, \n please ask again if you should need some clarifications. \n \n Your brother in Christ, \n \n Marco. \n PS I would like to give a scientific discussion about the existence of God and some recent miracles. \n \n I think that faith cannot come only from logic, because to have faith in God means to trust and love God. \n I think however that logics and science prove the existence of our soul and the existence of God and that there are many rational arguments strongly supporting the christian faith. \n I am a physicist and I will explain how science and logic prove that the our psychical life is intrinsically transcendent with respect to material reality, which implies the existence of the soul (or spirit) as a supernatural component of man. \n I think in fact that the more direct way to find the certainty of the existence of God is to try to understand our psychical life, that is our capacity to feel emotions, sensations, thoughts, self-awareness, etc. \n We know that our brain is made only of particles such as electrons and protons, interacting through the electromagneic fields; every biological process is due only to chemical reactions, and in their turn, every chemical reaction is due only to the electromagnetic interaction among valence electrons. \n Every materialistic attempt to explain our psychical life implies that what thinks, loves, suffers, desires ets. in us are objects such as electrons or electromagnetic fields. \n \n The point is that objects can feel nothing at all ; objects cannot feel happiness, sadness, love, anger,self-awareness, etc. \n Science has proved that the equations of the electromagnetic field are universal; they describe the electromagnetic field within our brain as well as within a copper wire or an atom. \n There is no trace of consciousness, sensations, emotions, etc. in the equations of physics. These equations do not explain the existence of consciousness and our capacity to feel. If one hypothesizes that the electromagnetic fields are responsible of our sensations, emotions and thoughts, the only logical conclusion would be that also our television, our washing machine, etc. sometimes would be happy or depressed. In fact, from a scientific point of view there is no difference between the electromagnetic fields present in our brain and the ones present in those objects. \n \n The claim that the electric impulses in our brain are or generate sensations and thoughts, is in contradiction with the laws of physics that consider equivalent all electric impulses, inside or outside our brain. In fact, an electric impulse is formed only by some electrons moving in a certain direction; according to the laws of physics, electrons are all equal and indistinguishable, and they are always moving in every material or electric circuits. To ascribe to the electrons in our brain the property to generate consciousness, and not to ascribe the same property to the electrons moving in a bulb, is in contradiction with one of the fundamental principle of physics, the Pauli Exclusion Principle, that establishes that all electrons are equal and indistinguishable, that is they have all exactly the same properties. \n \n Besides, the laws of physics establish that electric impulses generate only electromagnetic fields; so the materialistic hypothesis that the electric impulses in the brain generate sensations, emotions and thoughts is in striking contradiction with the laws of physics. The electromagnetic waves generated by the electric impulses in our brain are absolutely equivalent to the ones generated by any other electric impulses; such waves go out of our brain and travel in the external space at the velocity of light, as every electromagnetic wave. \n From a physical point of view our brain is only an object, and therefore it can have no psychical life; our psychical life represents a violation of the laws of physics. Every phenomenon which represents a violation of the laws of physics is considered a supernatural phenomenon ; therefore our psychical life is a supernatural phenomenon. \n Materialists think that the electromagnetic field is the origin of our consciousness, feelings, emotions, etc., but they cannot explain why the same fields do not make our electric objects have similar consciousness, feelings, etc. ; their position is in striking contradiction with our scientific knowledges which prove that there is no difference between the electric fields inside our brain and the ones outside our brain. \n If one supposes that the electric impulses in our brain were the origin of consciousness and emotions, the only possible logical consequence would be that every electric object has a psychical life and FEELS emotions, feelings, etc. \n \n The properties of every molecule (including DNA molecules) and every biological process can be obtained directly from the laws of physics. \n On the contrary consciousness, emotions, feelings, etc. cannot be obtained from the laws of physics; this is a further proof of the transcendent nature of consciousness with respect to the material reality. \n Our psychical life is intrinsically transcendent with respect to the material reality, because it cannot be originated by objects (such as electrons or electromagnetic fields) ; our psychical life is then intrinsically supernatural. \n \n Since our psychical life cannot be originated by objects such as electrons and electromagnetic fields, it means that our psyche (or mind, or spirit, or whatever you prefer) and our brain are two different interacting entities, and not the same entity. The psyche is the non-physical component of man. \n Where did our psyche come from? How did our psychical life begin? Science proves that our psyche cannot have a physical or biological origin, which proves that the only answer is God. \n In fact, I know that I exist, that I have not always existed and that I have not come into existence by myself; \n these certainties are very evident by themselves and need not be proved. \n I can then define God as the Creator of my psyche, He Who has made me exist as a psychical being, He Who has give origin to my psychical life. \n In other words, my reasoning can be summarized as follows: \n I FEEL my existence, therefore I exist as a psychical being (that is as a spirit). \n I exist, therefore God exists and He is the Creator of my own existence. \n \n The certainty of the existence of God is as evident as the certainty that I exist. \n I think that the existence of God is very evident by itself; the reason why atheists do not believe in God's existence is that they are so much terrorized by the idea of Hell that they deny every evidence. \n It is not God Who hides from man but it is man who often hides from God. \n This is explained also in the Bible; in fact, after committing sin Adam and Eve try to hide from God. \n I think that the truth is what can prove to be true by itself and is stronger than any doubt. \n The existence of God is for me evident by itself and stronger than any doubt. \n I think that to have faith means that a certainty exists inside us and that this certainty is not \n deduced by anything else, because it is evident by itself and is intrinsically stronger than any doubt. \n Faith is then the absolute certainty, in contrapposition to the relative certainties which can be obtained through an ordinary logical proof. \n In fact, every logical proof requires at least an hypotesis, and therefore our conclusions depend on our hypothesis. \n We cannot prove our hypotesis without another hypotesis. And so on. \n It follows that logic cannot be used to find an absolute truth, but it can give us only relative certainties (relative with respect to our hypotesis). \n If you seek an absolute truth you cannot rely only on logic ; \n the fact that objects such as electrons, electromagnetic fields, computers, etc. cannot have a psychical life, that is they cannot feel happiness, sadness, love, anger, etc. is an absolute truth ; this fact does not need to be proved because it is intrinsically obvious and evident by itself. \n The only possible materialist explanation of consciousness and emotions implies that objects such as electrons and electromagnetic fields have emotions, feelings, awareness, etc. This is in striking contradiction with logic (objects can feel nohing at all) and with our scientific knowledges, which prove that there is no difference between the electromagnetic fields inside and outside our brain. Materialism is only a modern kind of idolatry: in fact the idolatrous thinks that the object (idol) under certain circumstances has a psychical life, regardless of the fact that it is made with ordinary material; this is exactly what the materialist thinks, because he thinks that the object (brain) has a psychical life under certain circumstances, regardless of the fact that it is made with ordinary material (electrons, electromanetic fields, etc.) \n \n The fact that drugs can alter consciousness and mental capacities simply proves that an interaction between brain and psyche exists. By no means this can be considered a proof that the brain is the origin of consciousness and emotions. If you have a problem in your eyes, your visual capacities would be altered, but this does not prove that it is your eye which has the visual sensation; this simply proves that your eye is involved in the process of generation of the visual sensation. In the same way the studies on drug effects only prove an interaction between psycheand brain exist. The existence of this interaction is obvious; in fact, without this interaction, our psychewould be completely isolated from the external reality. The chemical reactions and the electric impulses which occur in our brain are not emotions, feelings, awareness etc; it is the our psyche who \"translate\" these ordinary physical processes into emotions, feelings, etc. Since the psyche is a supernatural entity, also the interaction brain-psyche has a supernatural nature, and it cannot be explained by science. \n Observe that the same mental alterations produced by drugs can be obtained through hypnosis; in the process of hypnosis there is no physical interation between the hypnotist and the brain of the hypnotized, which proves that the process of hypnosis has not a physical origin, but a psychical origin. The fact the the same alterations of consciousness can be obtained through hypnosis is a further proof that brain and psycheare not the same entity, but two different interacting entities. \n \n It must be stressed that the physical stimulus and the sensation we feel are two completely different phenomena. For example, the vibrations of the molecules of the air is not the sensation \"sound\" we feel; the molecules of the air hear nothing, and it would be absurd to say that the molecules of the air are a auditory sensation. The sensation \"sound\" exist only in the psychical reality, and not in the physical reality; the auditory sensation is generated only by the psyche and is the psychical elaboration of a physical stimulus. In the same way, the chemical reactions and the electric impulses which occur in our brain are not emotions, feelings, awareness; they are only physical stimuli. It is the our psyche who elaborates and translates these ordinary physical processes into emotions, feelings, etc. \n \n Now I would like to give some considerations about the reliability of our scientific knowledges. First of all I would like to explain the difference between a phenomenological theory and a first-principletheory. A phenomenological theory is only an approximated and simplified version of a first-principletheory, that represents the exact explanation of natural phenomena. Biology and neurology are examples of phenomenological theories, while physics is the only first-principle theory, from which all the other natural sciences derive. Of course, since first principle calculations are very lengthy and arduous, we need also simplified theories in order to treat more easily systems formed by many atoms. \n The laws of physics have a general validity, but in their application to specific systems, it is possible to use simpler rules, specific for that kind of system; these rules are neither extraneous, nor independent from the laws of physics, but they are a direct consequence of the law of physics. A result of these phenomenological theories cannot be accepted if it results to be in contradiction with the laws of physics, which are the only true principleat the origin of the phenomenological theory. Only the laws of physics represent the first-principle explanation of the material reality, both inorganic and organic matter. Obviously, an approximated theory (such as biology and neurology) cannot be used to deny the exact theory from which the approximated theory derives. \n \n All natural sciences are then subordinate to physics. We can also point out that all natural sciences (biology, neurology, etc.) use in their studies and in their microscopic analysis only instruments that have been designed uniquely on the basis of the laws of physics. The data studied and analysed by these natural sciences have sense only because the laws of physics assure the correct working of their instruments. If the laws of physics are questioned, all other natural sciences would immediately fall down to pieces, because all the microscopic data used by these sciences to support their theories, would lose any meaning. Therefore , no natural sciences can elaborate theories in contradiction with the laws of physics. This would mean to make all data to lose sense, data on which the phenomenological theories have been built; it is an obvious logical contradiction. The laws of physics are then the foundations of all natural sciences. \n \n The laws generating all chemical, biological, neurological processes are now perfectly known. Never before in history, science has been able to explain the principleby which all biological processes are originated. This represents a true turn in history. All that physics will discover in the future will have nothing to do with the biological processes in our organism, or any other organism. Even if there are still some things not perfectly known in astrophysics, these astrophysical process do not affect biological processes, which are due uniquely to the laws of quantum electrodynamics. There is then no reason to question the validity of the laws of physics in the explanation of biological or neurological processes. \n \n The laws of physics consists of a system of mathematical equations. Their mathematical structure exclude the possibility that these equations can be modified; in fact, even a slight change in a mathematical equation would generates radical changes in all its solutions. We have already found billions and billions of correct solutions from the laws of physics ; if we changed them, we would suddenly cast away all these correct solutions. On the other hand, every day we find a systematic experimental confirmation of the laws of physics on ever new systems. To hypothesize that the laws of physics are wrong would be equivalent to say that all these billions and billions of of systematic and quantitative experimental confirmations are only a lucky coincidence. In these last decades, we have done many more experiments than in all history, but the laws of quantum electrodynamics, discovered in the beginning of last century, have never been changed. On the basis of the number of experimental tests, we can say that quantum electrodynamics is the oldest scientific theory in history. \n \n Today we are able to do first-principle calculations for molecular systems formed by many atoms; this means that we can calculate the solutions of the equations of quantum physics also for macroscopic systems. The point is that we already know what KIND of information we can get from a first-principle calculation for every possible molecular system. In fact from the solution of the Schroedinger equation for a molecular system we know that we can obtain informations such as charge distributions or energy spectra. By no means we can obtain consciousness, emotions, feelings, etc. These are not possible outputs of a first-principle calculation. Even if we had a supercomputer with the capacity to find the wave function for our brain, we could find from the wave function only properties such as charge density or energy spectra. We could not find consciousness from the wave function calculated with the super computer. In fact we already know what KIND of properties can be obtained from every possible wave function. We are already able to do first-principle calculations for many different molecular systems, but the kind of properties we can find from their wave functions does not depend on which molecular system we have studied, because they are general outputs of every first-principle calculation, and it is independent from the kind of atoms or the number of atoms of the system. If the psyche did not exist as a non-physical component of man, according to our scientific knowledges we should be only a sort of biological robots, without any consciousness and without feeling anything, which actions and reactions were due only to chemical reactions . All the neurological studies prove only the existence of an interaction between psyche and brain, but they reveal nothing about the nature of the psyche. \n \n At this point, it is important to observe that it is possible to simulate with a computer every feature of the behavior of animals, including their capacity to learn and their apparent capacity to recognize their image in a mirror. An adequate software can allow the computer to record input data, analyze them and give specific outputs; all these operations occur automatically, with no consciousness. For example a computer, connected to a camera, can analyse the external images; this occur automatically through some mathematical algorithms, and the computer has no visual sensations. This proves that the fact that a can can distinguish a bone from a stick, does not imply that the dog has a visual sensation. \n \n Therefore it is not possible to exclude from a scientific and rational point of view, that the life of animals is only a purely biological/chemical process without any kind of consciousness (neither sensations or emotions). In other words, science cannot exclude the possibility that the animal is only a biological robot, feeling nothing at all, which actions and reactions are uniquely determined by a chemical software implanted in its brain. It is also possible to explain those behaviors of animals, that are usually considered as an indication of emotions. For example, the dogs that because of genetic mutations presented some affectionate behaviors, had a greater probability to be adopted by man, and consequently, to survive. It was sufficient that the animal presented those behaviors also towards only a member of the family (even not the one who gave it food) to be accepted by the family. It would be only a case of natural selection, even if unawares induced by man, that has programmed the behavior and the reactions of the dog. Since we have no way to observe directly the existence of any kind of consciousness in animals, and the hypothesis of existence of consciousness in animals is not necessary to explain the observable phenomena in animals, we can conclude that there is no experimental or scientific evidence of the existence of any kind of consciousness in animals, neither sensations or emotions. \n The idea that animals have sensations and emotions is then only an arbitrary hypothesis, without any scientific or rational foundations.. \n \n \n Let me then briefly discuss the theory of evolution. \n The theory of evolution is based on the recovery of fossils, therefore this theory can at the most conclude that our biological organism is the result of the evolution of a previous biological organism. \n The point is that what really distinguishes us from animals is our psychical life, which has no biological origin, but a supernatural origin ; our biological organism is certainly not much different from the one of other animals. \n Since it is not possible to find fossils of psyche, the theory of evolution can say nothing about the way we have become conscious and intelligent persons. \n Even if our organism derived from a previous animal organism, only the divine intervention could have given this organism the human mind. \n So God could have created the whole universe through the laws of physics and our organism could be the result of an evolutional process ; however our organism would have been only another animal organism if God would have not given us our psyche, changing a pure animal organism into a human person. \n \n In conclusion, today we know the laws which generate all chemical, biological and neurological processes; in fact, the laws of quantum electrodynamics are confirmed by such a huge number of experimental results that it would be absurd to question their validity in the description of molecular systems, and in particular of biological systems. Science proves that electrons are all identical and indistinguishable. The laws of quantum mechanics are universal and determine every chemical reaction and every molecular process, both in organic and inorganic systems. The electromagnetic fields are determined by the same universal equations , both in our brain and in any other inorganic system. \n \n The laws of physics allow to explain, a least in principle, all physical, chemical, biological, neurological and cerebral processes. However, in the laws of physics there is no explanations and no justifications of the existence of consciousness, neither of the most common sensation. Consciousness transcends the laws of physics, which proves that consciousness is due to a supernatural component, the psyche or soul, that is a non-physical entity, transcendent to the laws of physics and to the material reality. \n \n The psyche cannot then be identified with the brain, which is only a physical object, formed by electrons, protons and neutrons, which processes are determined uniquely by the laws of quantum electrodynamics. Therefore, consciousness and our psychical life cannot have a biological origin. There are then two distinct realities; the physical reality, that is the universe, which has an intrinsic mathematical structure (the laws of physics) determining every physical, chemical, biological and neurological process; the psychical reality, which transcends the laws of physics. \n \n At this point we must consider the question: where does our psyche come from? The phenomenon of consciousness proves that, at a certain time, our psyche certainly begins to exist in us. The laws of physics prove that the psyche cannot be the product of physical, chemical or biological processes. Therefore, the origin of our psyche is transcendent to the material reality. \n We can then identify with God the necessary Cause of the existence of the psyche, being such Cause transcendent to the physical reality. This represents a scientific confirmation of the existence of a transcendent God, the Creator of our soul. \n \n My reasoning \"I exists, therefore God exists\" simply proves that atheism as well agnosticism are false, illogical and in striking contraddiction with our scientific knowledges. \n Once you reach the certainty that God exists, you must try to understand Who God is and why God made us exist. \n The fact that God is the Creator of our mind, implies a very close relation between God and us and it is a further evidence of how much God deeply knows us and loves us. \n The fact that God is the Creator of our mind allows us to understand through logics some attributes of God. \n God is infinitely superior to us and more powerful than us because He has the power to create us, while we do not have the power to create anything and we need be created by Him in order to exist. This proves that an immense abyss of superiority separates God from us. \n Since God is the Creator of our intelligence, our consciousness, our capacity to love, to have a will, to rejoice, to have a psychical life, He must be infinitely more intelligent than us and He must have a will and a capacity to love and to have a psychical life infinitely superior to ours. \n Since God is the Creator of our (psychical) person, He must be Person. \n Since He is the Creator of us , He existed before us, and He exists independently from us. \n Since God is the Creator of our mind, He has the power to create counscious existence, therefore God owns in Himself conscious existence ; so God is He who exists consciously in Himself. \n The biblical name of God is YHWH, which means \"I am who I am\". ; the meaning of \"I am\" is conscious existence, because only a person who exists and is conscious of his own existence can say \"I am\". \n I believe that God is love, and that creation is an act of love. \n I firmly believe that God made me exists because he loves me and He wants me to share the full happiness of His eternal life. \n The certainty that God loves me is based on Jesus' word and on His sufferings and death; \n I know that there is nothing more than this that God could do in order to prove to me that He loves me. \n Since God loves us, He certainly manifested Himself to men. \n The Bible is the most ancient monotheistic book, and is then from the logical point of view the only possible candidate ; A loving God would never have abandoned humanity during the first part of history. \n Besides and most importantly, no religion in the world contains an immense act of love as the one of the christian faith: God makes Himself a man, and accepts an atrocious suffering and death in order to save us. For a person who believes that God is love, the christian faith is the only possible logical answer. \n Human life is based on two complemetary aspects: logic and love, that is the capacity of reasoning and the capacity to have feelings. \n Logic cannot give by itself a meaning to human life; logic cannot fill our life with happiness as only love does. \n The catholic faith is the perfect synthesis of love and logic. \n \n There are also rational arguments from history which supports the christian faith. \n Jesus did several powerful miracles to prove that He was the Son of God. \n He gave also the power to the apostoles to do powerful miracles. \n Even if we cannot see these miracles I think that it is possible to prove through logics \n that these miracles really happened. \n First of all, Jesus was killed by the pharisees because many jews believed that He was the Messiah. \n The Jews believed in powerfull miracles, and they expected that the Messiah \n would have been greater than Moses and all the prophets, who did very powerful \n miracles. \n If Jesus had not given powerful miracolous signs, nobody would have believed in Him, \n and the pharisees would not need kill Him. \n The hypotesis that Jesus could have been a phylosopher is in strong contradiction with the jewish culture; \n jews believed that wisdom can come only from God. \n No jew would have become a follower of a phylosopher; no phylosopher has ever existed among the jews, but only prophets; in particular, the jews were waiting for the Messiah. \n \n Christianity spread very rapidly among many different peoples, languages, cultures and religions, \n in spite of terrible persecutions against christians. \n This fact is unique in the history. \n In 64 dC (that is about thirty years after Jesus' death) the roman imperator Nero \n ordered the first great persecution of christians because he saw in Christianity a menace for the roman empire. \n Many other great persecutions of christians were ordered by the roman imperators until 311 dC. \n All these persecutions are very well proved by non-christian sources. \n In 112 dC, Plinium (a non-christian roman) in a letter to the imperator Traianus frm Bithinia wrote that \"all temples have been abandoned and are desert, and the christians are the only responsible of this situation.\" \n In the same letter he wrote that he tortured some cristians. \n I would add that the new christians were asked to leave their pagan and libertine behavior, \n to observe very rigid moral and sexual behavior and to be ready to give their life for Christ; \n if the apostoles never did miracles, nobody would have accepted this new religion. \n In the christian religion, the promise of the eternal life is bound to very rigid moral requests. \n In the first century, there were many religions who promised the life after death, \n without such rigid requests; certainly the promise of eternal life is not sufficient to explain the success of the christian religion. \n \n More recently, some supernatural facts occured at Fatima. \n On the 13-10-1917 more than 70000 people saw the sun dance in the sky, change color, and then fall down and coming up to its normal place; these facts lasted for about ten minutes and were saw not only from the 70000 people at Fatima, but also from people living in the villages around Fatima. \n Among those people there were also many atheist journalists from some anticlerical journals, \n who were there in order to discredit the religious \"superstitions\" of catholicism, since the child Lucia said that on that day God would have given a great sign for everybody. \n In fact, since 1910, the portuguese government had started a very hard battle against the Catholic Church: many religious orders were expelled and their property confiscated, new legislation banned the teaching of religion in schools and universities and annulled many religious holidays. Persecution of Catholics in the early years of the republic attracted international attention and brought the new political system into conflict with foreign diplomats, humanitarian organizations, and journalists. \n \n Those journalists have written very detailed accounts of the facts occurred at Fatima , \n which were reported on all newspapers in the world, including the New York Times. \n Among the journalists present at Fatima on October 17, there was the (atheist) director Avelino de Almeida of the government (and very antireligious) newspaper \"O Seculo\". The article, published with the title \"Terrifying Event! How The Sun Danced In The Sky Of Fatima\" can be found on the site \n \n www.ewtn.com/fatima/apparitions/October.htm \n \n In his article, the journalist describes a crowd of biblical dimensions, spread in the fields of Fatima. At a certain point, this immense crowd begins to cry \"Miracle! Miracle!\" looking at the sun. The journalists describes then an amazed crowd, who cry and pray. \n I have tried to analyse these data to see whether it was possible to find a plausible explanation, excluding a divine intervention, but I have found none. No scientifically acceptable explanations exist for such a phenomenon. \n I do not think it is reasonable to hypothesize a conspiracy of 70000 people, simulating a collective vision. On the other hand, it would not have been possible to hypnotize such a crowd, spread on an area of some square kilometers. Besides it is scientifically impossible, even with the present technology (you can imagine with the technology available in 1917!), to realize an optical illusion like that. \n Some atheists try to explain this miracle as a banal optical effect; when we look at the sun for a while, we see coloured pulsating spots, or when the clouds move in the sky, they can create the illusion that the sun is moving. \n Obviously, we all know this, we all have looked at the sun and we all know the effects, we all have seen the clouds moving in the sky. Those who were at Fatima certainly knew this as well. \n So, unless we hypothesize that at Fatima there were only 70000 XXXXXX, such explanation is not plausible at all. \n Some then speak about hysterism or suggestion. However, if catholics were all subject to hysteric crisis or they were so easily suggestionable, one couldn't explain why in 2000 years of catholicism there are no other cases of crowds witnessing to having seen such extraordinary phenomena. Actually, there was only the word of three children, and if this was sufficient to suggestionize so much catholics, then whoever claims to have some visions of Our Lady, could easily make a crowd of 70000 catholics to see the sun dancing in the sky. \n \n The miracle of Fatima is the most extraordinary and well recorded miracle in all history. This miracle has occurred in the Catholic Church, since the three children were catholics (Lucia, the only one of the three children still alive is a catholic nun). \n The fact that so many people saw these phenomena cannot be explained \n without the hypotesis of a supernatural being, because neither science nor \n logic would allow something like that to happen. \n Besides these facts occured exactly in the day and the place indicated several monthes before by the child Lucia. Neither science nor logics can explain the capacity to foresee the future. \n \n A brief and incomplete description of the supernatural facts occurred at Fatima can be found also in some contemporary encyclopedias, for example the Britannica (also available on internet at www.britannica.com) \n gives at the voice Fatima : \n \n village and sanctuary, Vila Nova de Our\u00e9m municipality, Santar\u00e9m district, central Portugal; it is located on the tableland of Cova da Iria, 18 miles (29 km) southeast of Leiria. F\u00e1tima was named for a 12th-century Moorish princess and since 1917 has been one of the greatest Marian shrines in the world, visited by thousands of pilgrims annually. On May 13, 1917, and in each subsequent month until October of that year, three young peasant children, Lucia dos Santos and her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto, reportedly saw a lady who identified herself as the Lady of the Rosary. On October 13, a crowd (generally estimated at about 70,000) gathered at F\u00e1tima witnessed a \"miraculous solar phenomenon\" immediately after the lady had appeared to the children. \n \n \n The fundamental role of miracles in the history of Christianity cannot be doubted. \n The miracles done by Jesus proved that He was the Messiah, and the miracles done by the apostoles proved that they were really sent by Christ. \n \n Miracles still happen within the catholic church. \n In the following site the 66 official miracles occured at Lourdes are described. \n The miracolous nature of these healings have been scientifically proved \n \n http://www.catholic-forum.com/catholicteacher/lourdescontents.html \n \n \n Other interesting sites \n \n http://www.fatima.org/miracle1.html \n \n http://www.therealpresence.org/eucharst/mir/lanciano.html \n \n http://www.sancta.org/eyes.html \n \n I have given above several rational arguments which explain why the certainty of the existence of God is for me as strong as the certainty that I exist. \n \n I give you here some consideration about the church. \n \n Who has the authority to interpret correctly the Bible and to teach correctly Jesus' teachings? \n \n Only a person who knows and understands what Jesus taught can teach what Jesus taught. \n So, who are the persons who really know Jesus' teachings? \n Many think they are teaching what Jesus taught, but they teach different doctrines, therefore it is evident that they are teaching only their opinions, because Jesus cannot contradicts Himself. \n \n Jesus gave the commandment to teach the Gospel ONLY to His disciples and He NEVER gave this commandment to the crowds; this clearly proves that not all can teach the Gospel, but only those who have been taught and sent (directly or indirectly) by Jesus. \n \n How did the Church's mission pass to each generation? \n The Bible explains this to us. \n \n Acts 6:2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said, It is not right that we should neglect the word of God to serve tables. \n 6:3 Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. \n 6:4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. \n 6:5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch. \n 6:6 These they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. \n \n The apostolic mission is passed to other people directly from the apostoles. \n \n Acts 14:19 And certain Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, who, having persuaded the people, stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing he was dead. \n 14:20 Yet, as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. \n 14:21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made disciples of many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, \n 14:22 Strengthening the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying that through much tribulation we must enter the kingdom of God. \n 14:23 And when they had appointed elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Lord, in whom they believed. \n \n Again it is Paul (who in his turn received the apostolic mission with the laying of hands, see Acts 9:15-19) who appoints the elders. \n \n 1 Timothy 4:14 Do not neglect the gift you have, which was conferred on you through the prophetic word with the imposition of hands of the presbyterate. \n 2 Timothy 1:6 For this reason, I remind you to stir into flame the gift of God that you have through the imposition of my hands. \n \n Paul writes clearly that the presbyterate is received with the imposition of hands. \n \n The prespityters in their turn, appointed other people: \n \n 2 Timothy 2:2 And what you heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will have the ability to teach others as well. \n \n Christ founded His Church 2000 years ago; He ordered the apostoles to teach His Word, and they appointed other people, who in their turn appointed other people, etc. so that the apostolic mission has lasted until our days. \n This is the catholic Church, which receives its apostolic mission form Christ and teach the true teachings of Christ, as they were given to the apostoles. \n There is an historical connection between the present catholic church and the church founded by Christ 2000 years ago, while there is no historical connection between the many protestant denominations and the church of Christ. \n In fact Christ never appeared to Luther or Calvin, etc.; Christ never authorized Luther to found a new church and to teach his opinions as if they were inspired by the Holy Spirit. \n All the apostoles did many powerful miracles which proved that they were really sent by Christ, but Luther did no miracle in order to prove that his interpretations were really inspired by the Holy Spirit. \n \n The protestant churches teaches many sinful doctrines, for example that divorce and remarriage are permissible, that abortion is permissible (some denominations), etc. \n \n Mt 16:18 And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. \n 16:19 And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. \n \n The Church is \"the pillar and ground of the truth\" (1Tm 3:15) \n \n These two verses are sufficient to prove that the Church of Christ teaches infallibly the truth. \n Christ founded His church 2000 years ago and He assured us that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against His Church. The Bible assures us that the Church is the pillar and ground of the truth. \n If the protestant churches were the church of Christ (which one among thousends of different denominations?), it would mean that Jesus lied when He said that the gates of Hell would have not prevail against His church and that the Bible is wrong when it says that the Church is the pillar of the truth. \n In fact, before 1500 dC there were only the catholic church and the eastern orthodox church. \n Since both the catholic church and the orthodox church teach doctrines such as prayer for the dead, prayers to saints, etc. if protestants were right, this would imply that the church founded by Jesus 2000 years ago had been defeated by Satan for about 1500 years. \n Christ spent more than three years with His disciples and taught them; How is it possible that Jesus' teachings were forgotten and replaced with sinful teachings for about 1500 years? \n All the people who lived during those centuries would have been induced to sin by the church founded by Christ; it is absurd that a loving Father would have allowed this to happen, and this would have certainly meant that the gates of Hell had prevaled against the church of Christ, in contradiction with His own words. \n Christ cannot contradict Himself; if Christ has taught through His Church certain doctrines for 1500 years, these doctrines cannot be considered sinful. \n \n Besides, only to Peter Jesus gave the keys of the kingdom of heaven; this proves that Jesus gave Peter a special role in the Church ; this is sufficent to prove Peter's supremacy. Consider that the very first act done by Jesus after founding His Church, is to give Peter the keys of the kingdom of heaven ; there is then a fundamental relation between these keys and the Church. After Peter's death in Rome, who has received the keys of the kingdom of heaven? I think that the most logical answer is: Peter's successor in Rome, the Pope. \n The special role of Peter still exist in the Church of Christ, and it is the role of Peter's successor, the Pope. This special role allow christians to identify with certainty the only true Church of Christ. There is in fact an historical continuity between Peter and the present Pope, the apostolic succession. \n \n Protestants usually think that their interpretations are inspired by the Holy Spirit ; but they are divided in thousends of different denominations and they have different interpretations. \n Since the Holy Spirit cannot contradicts Himself, it is evident that their interpretations are only fallible human opinions. \n In fact, when Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit, He was speaking directly to the apostoles only, and NOT to the crowds. John 16 :12-13\"I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. \n When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.\" \n Jesus NEVER made this promise to the crowds, but ONLY to the Apostoles when they were TOGETHER WITH PETER. Therefore you cannot generalize this promise to every christian; this verse can be applied ONLY to the bishops (the apostoles' successors) when they are together with the Pope (Peter's successor). \n I believe that God loves us; it follows that God has not abandoned us to our fallible human interpretations and opinions. \n Through the prophets, God prepared the Jews (even if only some of them) to receive Christ; Christ remained with His disciples for about three years and half and taught them all the necessary moral and spirital knowledges for our salvation, so that in their turn they could teach others, who in their turn could teach others, etc. \n In this way the teachings of Christ has spread throughout the world and the centuries through His Church, the catholic Church. \n A loving Father would never abandon His children to their human and fallible opinions. \n A loving Father would certainly give His children a \"guide\" so that they could receive His holy and good teachings. \n This \"guide\" is the Catholic Church, the Church founded by Christ 2000 years ago. \n \n \n Usually protestants say that the catholic church has been corrupted : \n If this were true, it would mean that Jesus was a lier, because He said that the gates of Hell would have not prevailed agaisnt His church. \n The truth is that corrupted men have been present within the church since the very beginning (Judas was one of the apostoles), but the church was never corrupted because its teachings were always good. \n Judas was sent by Jesus to teach the Gospel, to heal the sick, to cast demons (see Mt 10 :1-8) \n The fact that there were men within the church who commited grave sins, does not mean that the church is corrupted. \n Every man is responsible of his own sins, but the church is a divine institution and is above its human members and its doctrine is divine. \n The fact that Judas was corrupted does not mean that church of Christ was corrupted. \n \n Usually protestants believe in the Sola Scriptura principle, but there is in this case no verse in the Bible which establishes this principle. This is then a striking contradiction of protestantism. \n The Bible did not come down from the sky one day. \n The biblical canon was established by a Concilium of catholic bishops three centuries after Christ, and so the christian communities lived for three centuries without the New Testament. \n Jesus never wrote anything, which clearly proves that the christian faith cannot be founded on a book. \n Jesus founded a Church , and NOT a book. \n Jesus chose to found a living Church, a living and visible guide for all christians, to help them to understand the Truth. \n Jesus is still the head of the Church and He still leads His Church. \n Jesus still teaches and guides us through His living Church, the Catholic Church. \n The Bible says that \"The Church is the pillar and bulwark of the truth\" (1Timothy 3 :15). \n Jesus gave the Church the authority of binding and loosing (Mt. 18 :17-18). \n Jesus never wrote anything ; the New Testament has been produced by the Church, and the Church still produces writings to teach us the spirital and moral Truth. \n The same Holy Spirit Who inspired the authors of the Bible, still leads the Magisterium of the Church in its apostolic mission. \n The Cathechism contains the official teachings of the Church, and it is to be considered inspired by the Holy Spirit. \n You can find the Cathechism on line at \n \n www.christusrex.org/www1/CDHN/ccc.html \n",

   "Yes I suppose you are right about me needing to \"learn critical thinking skills\" but you know, I'm trying the best I can and the best way to learn is to learn from other people. Somehow the question I asked was never really answered or debated, somehow it got off topic about \"whether God really exists or not\". I don't really care what others have to say, I'm an observer I like to know what other people think, what they have to say, so no hard feelings on anyone. I take it like it is. But then I've just thought of a new question, but I don't think I'll spawn it..I'll save it for a rainy day :)\n\n i'd like to hear your question\n \nWhen we die and go to live with God in heaven, will we be able to posses certain emotions? I mean look at Lucifer. He was an angel, he was perfect. But there had to be something there, some kind of envy/jealousy that caused him to want to exceed the power of God. So then that ties in with angels being able to have free will. So when we go to heaven will we still have free will and emotions? And no, I'm not talking about the 1000 year reign, I'm talking about finally living in heaven.\n\n lets see... youre living for eternity, with perfect mental capacity to grasp information, evaluate it and remember it. lets say after the first 50 billion years of your eternal existence, you, and everybody else around you, have a full and comprehensive knowledge of everything in heaven and everybody the live there, including the angels and God himself. but because heaven is perfect, there is no conflict, no competitiveness, and no need to prove or accomplish anything. so what do you do with all this knowledge? how do you keep being as fascinated at seeing golden streets and gates of pearl after the billionth time the same way you were the first time you saw them? \n \n one solution could be that our memories are so short-term that every experience we encounter in heaven would effectively be our first time, since we'd not remember that we saw the same event before. this would be one sure way to keep all heaven participants in a state of perpeual bliss and awe of the glory of their surroundiings\n \n another could be that our curiosity and imaginative faculties are totally disabled, so that we are totally unable to imagine something thats not in heaven. this would make sense, since if heaven is totally good, then anything not in heaven will be bad, or at least less than good. it would be impossible to wish things were different, or to use your almost unlimited knowledge to imagine and improvement on something that exists (of course, as far as you are concerned, nothing can be improved, so why invent?)\n \n maybe there are other ways this could be achieved, but either of the 2 methods above would work.\n \n interestingly enough, there are people that fall into either of the above groups, and are indeed in a perpetual state of glee and euphoria. there's is a conflict-free existence. challenges dont exist to them. in fact, those people are probably as close to experiencing heaven than any of us here can ever be.\n \n however, i dont think youd really want to trade places with those people, if youve figured out who they are",

To ascribe to the electrons in our brain the property to generate consciousness, and not to ascribe the same property to the electrons moving in a bulb, is in contradiction with one of the fundamental principle of physics, the Pauli Exclusion Principle, that establishes that all electrons are equal and indistinguishable, that is they have all exactly the same properties.\n\n \n Nerve impulses are not electric currents; neurobiologists do not ascribe consciousness or memory or emotion or any other brain function to the movement of electrons. This whole section is a gigantic straw man.\n \n \nThe fact that drugs can alter consciousness and mental capacities simply proves that an interaction between brain and psyche exists. By no means this can be considered a proof that the brain is the origin of consciousness and emotions.\n\n \n The fact that drugs can eliminate consciousness indicates that the latter property does indeed depend on physicochemical events in the brain: it is generated by them. No amount of bluster will make that inconvenient fact go away.\n \n \nThe theory of evolution is based on the recovery of fossils, therefore this theory can at the most conclude that our biological organism is the result of the evolution of a previous biological organism.\n The point is that what really distinguishes us from animals is our psychical life, which has no biological origin, but a supernatural origin ; our biological organism is certainly not much different from the one of other animals.\n Since it is not possible to find fossils of psyche, the theory of evolution can say nothing about the way we have become conscious and intelligent persons.\n\n \n The theory of evoultion does not, as you imply, depend wholly on fossil evidence; this renders your last sentence here invalid. You assert that human consciousness must have had a supernatural origin, and as elsewhere expect others to regard your assertions as self-evidently true. They are not, and you have provided no valid evidence to support them.",

As to the first item: It is absolutely abhorent that God would FORCE me to be with him when I did not want to be. I define hell as being separated from God and not a geographical place. It is used that way in the bible from time to time (as a place that is) but when all references are taken as a whole it becomes clear that it is less a place and more of a state. It would be no less of a hell to be with God when you did not want to be than it would be to be separated from Him when you wanted to be separated from Him. Additionally, from my own POV, it is abhorrent that any should suffer that, it is why I choose to tell people about Christ when they ask about it. God does not desire it (according to the bible) and so sent His Son in order that none would have to face it. His atoning sacrifice suffices into the past as well. \n \n As to the second item: YOur love is not dependent on your childs behavior even IF they arrived at eroneous beliefs through a lack of inquiry. You simply love your child. John 3:16 says that \"For God so loved the world...\" and I believe it. GOd loves all. His desire is that all will be saved. There are those that will choose otherwise. I don't like that idea, but would you force your child to be with you (once they are grown) even if they did not want to be?\n \n EF",

   "This is the only evidence I have witnessed personally to whether or not there is such a thing as a \"afterlife\"... [COLOR=&quot;Blue&quot;]Unlike so many people on here that are saying they KNOW that this myth called God, Christ and the hokus pokus things called \"souls\" do NOT exist and never have, I feel a bit different on those viewpoints. Here is a old post of mine on here from 2004 ..\n \n \n I was raised to go to church very Sunday until I was at least 13 years old, and then my parents said I could make my own choice as to whether to continue going to church or not. So, at 13, I chose to stop going to church at all anymore. My mother was a great woman, low in education, but savy in life , a life she lived hard and one not made any easier by raising 9 of us kids, on a poverty income during the Great Depression. She was a house Christian, to me meaning she did not ever go to church with us, but was raised a Christian, read her big old family Bible with vigor, and believed with all her heart that Christ was her Saviour.... \n \n When I was 21 and living single in my own apartment, I made sure to visit Mom at least weekly to check on her , she at that time being a widow living alone. She was my favorite parent of the two, and we were always close, we could talk about anything with the upmost sincerity and honesty. Almost every visit, she would end it by asking me if I had any intention of going back to church. I always had the same reply to her, saying church had nothing to offer me, and that I didnt need it to teach me how to lead a good moral life , and that she had raised me just fine. But, she always countered by saying , \" Church is not just to teach you about a moral life, its most important thing, is to teach you that Christ is your Saviour , and by accepting Him and believing in Him with all of your heart that He is your Saviour ,and by that belief, you will be saved fron damnation in Hell. \" ....\n \n Now, that one always got my goat, so to speak. Those very same words were taught to me in Sunday school as a kid and I had not gotten a grasp of of them back then, and it made no more sense to me at 21 years of age. I was always respectful to Mom, so I would not go up against her with counter claim, but would just mumble something about I needed to get to the laundrymat before it closed, etc. So, I would give her a big hug and kiss and exit promply. But , as the years went by she continued reminding me that to be saved , I must turn my life over to Christ, be baptized in his name , to avoid the eternal fire and damnation....\n \n Finally, one pretty Sunday fall afternoon in 1982, I was visiting with her and having a good evening of chit chat. By now she was 78 years old and had a lot of physical ailments afflicting her. So, this day I was feeling more accomodating , and was willing to debate this fire and brimstone thing with her. As of yet, I still had not been back to church , and was not baptized . So, after she gave me her speech again about wanting me to go back to church and get baptized, her voiced sort of trailed off and a sadness came over her face. In her next sentence she said, \" Son, I dont know how much longer I have here on earth, and I just dont want to lie down and die, and know that when I draw my last breath , that you are still not saved yet . \" ...\n \n Well, her words kind of got to me and sort of stuck in my gizzard so to speak, so I opened up to her with what my feelings were, about this hell thing. I told her that in order for a person to be afraid of hell, they need to know, and be proven to them, that there is such a place, OR at LEAST prove to me, there is a afterlife. I told her that without a soul or spirit energy living on after physical death, THAT would make the concept of eternal torment hellfire , a complete impossibility in my mind. I asked her that in her long lifetime, had she ever had ANY aknowledgement of a person that had died, and then came back and proved to her that a afterlife existed ?. She replied with a no, and that it was just something she was raised to believe in, and she believed in her heart that Christ was real, and so was the afterlife...\n \n Being 29 now, and so worldly in my ways, I couldnt accept that. To me it just didnt make sense, and it had no logic to it at all. What ? Believe in something you cannot see, smell, or touch ?? Humbug , I thought. So , in my huge and wise 29 year old mind, I came up with a thought to make her PROVE to me a afterlife existed. I knew my Mom had NEVER (that I knew of anyway) mislead me about anything, or lied to me in my whole 29 years of living. So I had a thought...\n \n We sat there and wound down on the topic, her not winning, nor I for that matter. So, finally I rendered to her my ingenious, agnostic thought. I told Mom that by ALL probability, she would expire before I would, and she concured. So, my Mom and I made a pact that Sunday afternoon, and hugged on it, one that I knew in my heart I could trust her or myself, to live up to. She agreed to me, that if she died first, she would do something, ANY thing, to let me know her spirit/soul had lived on beyond her death. Even if it meant she had to carry a lamp across the room in front of me. So, every time I visted Mom thereafter for the following 10 years, the Christ and hell fire thing was never brought up again between us ...\n \n On August 13, 1992 in the late evening, the phone rang and my wife answered it. It was my sister calling from the nursing home, Mom had just passed away a hour ago, she said. She was found in her favorite chair, her Harlequin romance book still clutched in her hand, like she had just nodded off in to death. All arrangements were made, Mom was laid to rest beside Dad at the cemetery...\n \n About 45 days after Mom was buried, one night something really weird happened at my home. I recall it as if it was yesterday, the exact events of it. It was 2 am, when I was wakened by what I thought was a earthquake or at least a tremor, because my mattress was shaking rapidly from side to side. I thought I might just be in a \"sleep/dream state\" so I quickly sat up in the bed to tell my wife lying next to me about it. But she was not there. She and our chow dog both, were standing in the bedroom doorway . They both had their eyes bugged out, looking at me and the bed mattress moving side to side. I quickly asked my wife \" Was it a tremor ? Was anything else on the walls shaking ? She said no, and by the time she said no, the mattress stopped moving from side to side. We both went back to bed and said no more about it...\n \n We both went to work the next day and at that time we worked different shifts . Finally, late that night we sat down to eat and I started the topic about the bed shaking side to side the night before. I asked her if I was crazy, making it up, or just had a nightmare. I let her tell me what she had experienced, without me telling my experience first. That way, I knew I would not be leading her in to saying something I had felt, I wanted to know what she had felt first. She told me that she was awakened by a violent side to side movement of the mattress about 2 am. When she opened her eyes, our chow dog , who always slept at the foot of the bed on the floor, was already in the bedroom door looking back at the bed, with its hair bristled and ears laid flat. She said as she ran to the bedroom door and looked back at me, I sat up and asked her was it a earthquake, and she said that the mattress was still moving side to side. SO, she had seen and felt what I had , without us ever discussing it, so it wasnt contrived by us or a nightmare shared by us....\n \n I never gave the incident anymore thought until one day about 3 months later a guy I worked with, a baby Christian it just so happened, was spouting scripture about the hellfire and brimstone. It instantly took my mind back to Mom, and our long chats about that subject . It even took me further back, to when as a child and even as a young teen, Mom awoke me every morning by putting her knee against the head of my mattress, and would violently shake it side to side, until I woke up.",
