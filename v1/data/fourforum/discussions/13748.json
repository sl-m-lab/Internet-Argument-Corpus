   "There are many people in the world who wish, pray and are working for peace, justice and security for all in the Holy Land. At this time of year there is nothing that make me happier that finding new groups of people that are working for PEACE and security for a better world. A new group, I came across recently is mepeace.org mepeace.org They provide a platform where people from all over the world can come to discuss the Palestinian-Israeli Crisis. People from both sides come together to discuss this expositive topic in a very civilized manor trying to make things better for both sides. It was on mepeace.org I learned about another newly formed group Lend for Peace LendforPeace.org - Microlending for the Middle East It was started last year by a group of former students of the University of Pennsylvania. Lend for Peace gives micro loans to people with small business in the West Bank and Gaza. We need stronger groups like these before there will be any long lasting peace.",
