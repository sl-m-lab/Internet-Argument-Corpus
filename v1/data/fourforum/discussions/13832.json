See how he Truly believes that he has every right to reflect his Reality. He gives us a message of Forbidden Truth.\n \n Comments?",

   "Frank loses due to the demands of society.\n \n Society was around long before Frank ever existed, it'll be around long after he's turned to dust. Society has set forth the rules that all must live by, none are allowed to reject the rules and live in their own manner.\n \n If you were really superior, you wouldn't feel compelled to keep posting here when everyone else is inferior to you.\n \n But then again, as a superior being you're compelled to become angry and irrational at the drop of a hat. Somebody mocks your bed buddy Lloyd Demause and you have no choice but to respond to criticism and ridicule. Anything else is being dishonest and turning away from the truth.",
