   "Here's some o' that \"Change we can believe in\".\n \n \"ORLANDO, Fla. -- They may be in cages and aquariums in your home now, but they could soon be banned. A proposal in front of lawmakers could stop pet stores from selling all kinds of exotic animals. Customers at the Bird Cabin in Orlando are greeted by a sign warning them that a proposal in Congress could cost them everything.\n \n \"It would literally shut us down,\" store representative Cheryl Brown said.\n \n The Non-Native Wildlife Invasion Prevention Act was recently introduced and would ban non-native species not approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. That means many of the fish and animals sold at pet stores would be outlawed, including snakes, hamsters, Guinea pigs, ferrets and birds like the African grey parrot.\n \n \"This bill stops everything. It closes the pet industry down,\" Brown said.\n \n \"That's ludicrous. Who would stop you from having a Guinea pig or a gerbil? My daughter loves her gerbil,\" Mike Feior said.\n \n Even breeding certain species would have to stop. Some pet owners think it could cause even more problems.\n \n \"It would make more of an illegal market,\" Lauren Kaplan said.\n \n So why is Congress considering such a ban?\n \n \"We are already seeing tremendous impacts of invasive species.\"\n - Bryan Wilson\n \n \"We are already seeing tremendous impacts of invasive species,\" Animal Rights Foundation representative Bryan Wilson said.\n \n Wilson said the ban is long overdue.\n \n \"The state of Florida is having to pay a lot of money to kill these iguanas, and they're killing them in a rather cruel manner. They're freezing these animals to death,\" Wilson said.\n \n The python population is also dramatically increasing in the Florida Everglades. Supporters of the bill said when it comes to birds, many people don't realize how long some of them live. A hawk-headed parrot can live 50-60 years. In some cases, people give them to zoos or bird sanctuaries.\n \n \"These birds can overpopulate and cause a lot of ecological damage,\" Wilson said.\"\n \n The first hearing for the bill is slated for Thursday Congress Considers Ban On Exotic Pets - Family News Story - WESH Orlando\n .\n\n Obviously the problem of non-native predatory species or over-crowding is an issue that needs to be addressed. But not by outright banning people from having things like tropical fish, hamsters, guinea pigs, etc. As usual, Democratic proponents in Congress seem to want to approach problems via over-regulation by default. Meanwhile, other far worse problems face us.",
