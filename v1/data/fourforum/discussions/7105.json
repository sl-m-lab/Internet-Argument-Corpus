   "The Anglo-Saxon Model (found in Brittain, New Zeeland, USA, Ireland and Australia)\n \n An ideal vision\n \n The Anglo-Saxon model is, acording to the Adam Smith Institute, based on the idea of competition and conflict. This permates the Brittish political system it`s legal system and it`s economic system. \n \n Politicly speaking, the Anglo-Saxon model discourage the formation of coalitions and encourages majority governments. The non-proportional system creates a political climate where the winner takes everything, and the loser(s) takes nothing.\n \n Economicly speaking, the Anglo-Saxon model encourages free-market capitalism. The market is the battlefield, and consumers and profits are the prices. The idea of working towards a collective good is alien to the Anglo-Saxon model and free competition based on indvidual gains are legion. \n \n The effects of economic competition between individuals can be likened with an evolutionary process, where the survival of the fit and natural selection will lead to economic and social progress. This also implies that the changes will be slow, rather than dramatic, an ever-changing status quo if you allow for contradictions. And the economic systems needs to be both durable and flexible in order to allow these continuing changes. \n \n What does this mean then?\n \n It all boils down to one thing. Government intervention in the economy should be severely restricted. Using tarrifs on trade and regulations on (domestic and foreign) investments should be shunned. The market is capable of assigning resources in a most efficient manner whereas the government can do nothing but create inefficiency. The model of comperative advantages is evidence of the superiority of free trade over tarrifs and regulations.\n \n The labour markets should be based on competition as well and the stickyness of employment should be reduced as much as possible. To combat structural and short-term changes on the labour markets, the Anglo-Saxon model prescribe increased flexibility through re-training, re-location and increasing the informational exchange between work-seekers and employers who seek workers. Taxes and other social costs on labour should also be avoided as far as possible as these limit the flexibility through raising the cost of hiring. Apart from increasing unemployemnt and reducing employment, high costs of hiring will also discourage new entrants on markets, something that would threaten the whole Anglo-Saxon model. Minimum wages would have the same effects as social costs on labour and is also shunned.\n \n Wellfare offers an alternative to work and therefor discourages competition and is generally a drag on the economy. All unemployment benefits and wellfare payments should be geared towards finding work for the recipient. When unemployment benefits or wellfare payments does not increase the matching process, they are counter-productive and should be disbanded.\n \n Regulation on bussiness is the largest obstacle for an evolutionary behaviour of the economic system. Regulations are inherrantly anti-competative and discourage free entrance on markets and they cost vast sums to implement that needs to be financed. This does not mean that all regulation is always bad, but the economic consequences are indeed severe and must always be considered. Regulations geared towards market sollutions are always prefered over other types of regulations.\n \n The Anglo-Saxon model is also sceptic towards government particpation in the economy. The government cannot be trusted to compete on equal terms with other participants and can therefor only be expected to stiffle competition and reduce efficiency. Governments are not fit to formulate the economic prioritees as the individual citizens are more apt at formulating their own preferences. Certain activities does however not benefit from competition, for example defence and law enforcement and should therefor be the domains of government activity. Privatisation of industries and services are to be pursued.\n \n Courtesy of Adam Smith Institute\n \n http://www.adamsmith.org/thinkpiece/000496.php\n \n So what do you think, is this a good description of the free-market capitalism (read laisse faire capitalism, neo(classical)-liberalism)? Do you agree to these ideals or do you object? Is this how Brittain, Ireland, The US and New Zeeland is governed?\n \n My plan is to present at least one more idealised model and perhaps how these models have been implemented in various countries and what the consequences have been. If there is an interest, we could also discuss a future economic model for EU or even the US.",

   "@ Eddie :\n \n From my knowledge of European political and economic history, I am familiar with both economic models you have outlined. I think what you refer to as the Anglo Saxon Model, might be described as the classic statement of free market economics: I agree with Wraith (and myself !) in saying that it applies more accurately to American capitalism than to the mixed economies of Europe.\n \n Rhineland Capitalism, or the social market as evolved in Germany under Erhard and Adenaur, can be understood as:\n \n 1). an economic sanctuary from the threat of communism and the experience of fascism.\n \n 2). a response to the moral challenges posed by gross inequalities of income, wealth, and power that are created by capitalism.\n \n 3). an expression of consensus politics in which capitalism is managed in the social interest - what the French call, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sociale de l'enterprise.\n \n Britain occupies a half way house between the American/Classic economic model and the fully developed Rhineland Model. It's certainly the case that Mrs Thatcher attempted to adapt American ultra free market principles to the British economy; I think how far she succeeded, is still a matter of debate. An up to date reading of the Blair government's pan-European intentions can be interpreted as an attempt to move the EU away from the post-war political and economic settlement, and towards the insecurities of the US system. This is at the root of French/British hostilities. \n \n On a personal note: I'm very comfortable discussing the generalities of economic and political history, but I'm not an economist and would not wish to enter into a discussion that requires expert acquaintance with the analytical concepts used in economic science.",

I do trust you on this one. All my questions are genuine.\n\n \n I would distinguish the British Model (economy and society) as being regarded as the nearest in Europe to the American system. Employment protection here is feeble compared with European standards; business regulation and all forms of taxation are resisted as \"burdens\". Market values such as the maximization of shareholder interest have tended to undermine the idea that business has social obligations to its workforce. The influence of trade unions in Labour party politics has been deliberately weakened by Mr Blair and his associates. \n \n On the positive side, there is still a core allegiance to the ideals of welfare capitalism; a social contract in the form of unemployment benefits, minimum wage regulations, and above all, \"free\" education and health care, is under constant attack but unlikely to be broken - the people are too fiercely attached to it. \n \n There is a debate going on between Britain and the EU that even the pro-European consensus participates in: it is concerned with the question of whether the European single market ought to copy America and deregulate its way to prosperity. I've oversimplified, but I think Mr Blair would like to use British weight in Europe to push the EU down that \"liberalising\" path towards the American economic model.",

   "@ Mr Ryan\n \n I`ve noticed this debate as well. There appears to be basicly two sides of the issue. Those who point towards american prosperity and use that as an argument for pursuing economicly liberal polycies and agendas for the EU. And those who point towards american inequality and says that we cannot possibly be willing to make that trade. Brittain is often being used, as far as I`ve understood it, as an example by both sides. Not quite like the american model, but perhaps a possible european version of it. And for obvious reasons, in recent years, Ireland has also been used as an example, but mostly by neo-liberals. Estonia seems to have captured attention as well (I think it has to do with a flat tax rate and deregulated bussines coupled with strong economic performance).\n \n I`ll see if I can dig something up about the debate.",
