   "Saddam Hussein? Will we have Saddam redux?\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/weekinreview/12burns.html\n \n November 12, 2006\n Stability vs. Democracy\n Could a New Strongman Help? \n By JOHN F. BURNS\n BAGHDAD\n THE sight of Saddam Hussein haranguing the court that sentenced him to death last week in Baghdad may have done little to slow his trip to the gallows, which looks ever more likely to come early next year if the appellate court, as expected, moves swiftly to uphold the sentence.\n \n But Mr. Hussein's outbursts served to remind many Iraqis, even those who hated him most, of something they crave in the rudderless nightmare Iraq has become under his successors: a strong leader, able to forge a nation from the country's fractious ethnic and religious groups, and to end the current wave of sectarian bloodletting that, left to build on itself, could ultimately match the mass killing that characterized Mr. Hussein's psychopathic years in power.\n \n It is something ordinary Iraqis say with growing intensity, even as they agree on little else. Let there be a strongman, they say, not a relentless killer like Saddam Hussein but somebody who will take the hammer to the insurgents and the death squads and the kidnappers and the criminal gangs who have banished all pretense of civility from their lives.\n \n Let him ride roughshod, if he must, they say, over the niceties of due process and human rights, indeed over the panoply of democratic institutions America has tried to implant here, if only he can bring peace.\n \n The message appears, so far, to have found little resonance in Washington as President Bush sets out, after the shock of the midterm elections, to review American policy on Iraq. The closest anyone with the White House's ear has come to suggesting anything short of democratic rule, let alone an authoritarian model typical of other countries in the Middle East, are leaks from the bipartisan commission headed by James A. Baker III and Lee H. Hamilton, which is charged with suggesting a new American approach to Iraq; some of its members have said that the group has considered recommending that stability, rather than democracy, should become the principal objective there.\n \n For the Bush administration, which made democracy-building here a cornerstone of everything it did after the American-led invasion, abandoning that goal now would be tantamount to abandoning one of its core missions. Coming on top of the failure to find the weapons of mass destruction that were the original justification for going to war with Mr. Hussein, it would constitute an about-face of historic proportions. But many Iraqis believe that it may now be the only hope - and a slim one, at that - of halting their country's descent into catastrophe.\n \n Of the many hard lessons America may take from its enterprise here, the impracticality of grafting American political values onto a society as different as Iraq's, by measure of culture, religion and historical experience, will surely be one. History may judge that attempting it in the midst of a savage war was the greatest of follies. Far from Iraq becoming a beacon of democracy for the Middle East, some Arab scholars have said, the violence in Iraq will embolden other Arab leaders who defend their authoritarianism as a bulwark against chaos.\n \n Lately, President Bush has put less emphasis on building democracy in his evolving definition of the American objective in Iraq. \"A government that can defend, govern and sustain itself\" was the way he put it at his news conference on Wednesday, a formulation that suggests that he, too, may have reduced the focus on the Jeffersonian ideals prevalent in the headier days after the American-led invasion. Then, L. Paul Bremer III, head of the American occupation authority, set aside $750 million for what was called \"democracy building,\" sometimes with results that bordered on the comical.\n \n One example was a democracy center in the southern city of Hilla, led by a man Mr. Bremer described as one of the most remarkable Iraqis he had met, Sayyid Farquat al-Qizwini. Mr. Qizwini, a towering figure with a bird's-nest beard and a black turban signifying his descent from the Prophet Mohammed, moved onto the American payroll after he \"liberated\" a mosque Saddam Hussein had built and named for himself, and used it for democracy classes for Shiite imams and tribal leaders. Away from the Americans, Mr. Qizwini liked to make a joke of the enterprise, saying he had once had to sing the praises of Mr. Hussein and, for $100 a day, was happy to do the same for the Americans.\n \n The American enterprise in Iraq has had its high points, notably the three occasions when Iraqis went to the polls in their millions - the election in January 2005 for a transitional government; the referendum in October 2005 on a new Constitution; and a second election in December 2005 for the four-year government now in office. For anyone who experienced the brutal repression under Mr. Hussein - and the single-candidate \"referendum\" in 2002 that gave him a new, seven-year presidential term with a claimed 100 percent of the vote - there was something intoxicating in the sight of Iraqis voting freely for the first time in their history, with dozens of parties contesting for their support.\n \n (More)",

   "But in hindsight, the elections, far from bringing Iraqis together, served to harden the divides of ethnicity and religion. In the two elections, only a tiny percentage of the votes went to secular parties that bridged those divides. The big winners were Shiite religious groups whose objective was to secure Shiite domination after centuries of subordination to the minority Sunnis, and to extend the role of Islam in the national life. The Americans succeeded in drawing moderate Sunnis into the political process, and later into a subordinate role in the national government. But the net effect of the elections, for many Sunnis, has been to ratify their new status as second-class citizens in the new Iraq.\n \n Now the divides are wider than ever, entrenched by Sunni insurgents and Shiite death squads that are locked in a sectarian nightmare of suicide bombings, kidnappings and mass executions. America's 150,000 troops are caught in the middle, hunting killers on both sides, but finding little partnership from the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.\n \n After pledging from the outset of his tenure six months ago to act decisively against the militias that spawn the death squads, Mr. Maliki has so far resisted any concrete actions to disarm or demobilize them. Instead, he bows to Shiite leaders in the coalition who control the two most powerful militias, the Mahdi Army and the Badr Organization.\n \n If anything, Mr. Maliki's standing, outside the Shiite religious constituency he represents, is lower now than that of his predecessor as prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, whose year at the head of the transitional government was notable, American officials say, for its lethargy and corruption.\n \n So plainly disaffected have the Americans become with Mr. Maliki that he used a telephone call with Mr. Bush last month to ask if the White House planned to unseat him. Aides to the prime minister said he sought and received Mr. Bush's reassurance after picking up rumors in the Green Zone government compound that American officials were feeling out Iraqi politicians on the possibility of replacing the Maliki administration with a \"national salvation government\" to be headed by an unnamed \"Shiite strongman.\"\n \n The leading candidate for strongman, among secular Iraqis, at least, would be Ayad Allawi, whom the Americans named prime minister in the first post-Hussein government, in 2004. Mr. Allawi, though Shiite, has strong ties with Sunnis, and a reputation as a hard man that goes back to his time as a young Baathist enforcer. During his government, as much as $1 billion in Iraqi defense funds went missing, Iraqi officials have alleged, but no charges have been brought against him. These days, out of government, he spends most of his time at his family home in London. \n \n But even if President Bush were convinced that Mr. Maliki should go, it is far from clear that the Americans would have the means to get rid of him.\n \n The mechanism for any such move could hardly be so crude as the American-backed overthrow of President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam in 1963; he ended up dead, a bullet in his head, in the rear of an American-made armored personal carrier outside Saigon's presidential palace. The obvious route in Baghdad would lie through the Iraqi Parliament, where the ruling Shiites, bitterly divided among themselves, control the government through a shaky alliance with Kurdish parties.\n \n A parliamentary coup might unseat Mr. Maliki personally, but it would be much tougher to shake power loose from the Shiite religious groups. Those parties have been held together by the overarching influence of Iraq's most powerful Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.\n \n The ayatollah is keenly aware of the lessons of the 1920's, when Shiites split among themselves, rose in rebellion against the British colonial administration and ultimately lost power to the Sunnis. From his cloistered existence in the holy city of Najaf, he has told the Shiites that they must hang together at all costs.\n \n So far, they have, and little now on the horizon suggests that is likely to change.",
