   "In all likelihood Ukrainians are very brave people if they are ready to nominee for the Presidency such a shady political figure as, for example, Y. Tymoshenko. As an ordinary European, I cannot even imagine how the woman with so well-known criminal plume is able to pretend to the post of president of the young democratic state as current Ukraine... \n Moreover, it is common knowledge that both the US supporters of Ukrainian democracy and Russian neighbors have serious discrediting data towards Tymoshenko's previous activities. All this makes her future steps externally controllable, which constitutes a great danger for independence of Ukrainian state. \n I think Ukrainian electoral should realize it as soon as possible. Otherwise as a result of Tymoshenko's election to the post of Ukrainian President you'll get a blank and puppet ruler instead of a true national leader, who will be able to advance your country to the EU, returning you prosperity and confidence in the morrow!",
