   "I hear many complaints about \"separation of church and state\".\n Why is it that the issue of \"separation of church and business\" never comes up?\n \n Because there is no legal doctrine establishing that businesses can't put up crosses on their property. No legal doctrine preventing a business owner from \"establishing\" his own public endorsement of religion.\n So why don't they?\n \n I mean, why is it supposedly \"appropriate\" and \"exercise of free religion\" to put a 29 foot tall cross on public land...\n It's supposedly an \"exercise of free religion\" to place a 5,280 pound ten commandment monument in the court house...\n \n But in places that CHRISTIANS ACTUALLY own, like their delis and oil change spots and barber shops and convenience stores and ...\n THOSE places, you just don't see it...\n \n Why is that?\n Is it only fun if you're trying to usurp government land? Is that it?",

   "Cause laws allow people to sue the businesses they work for for a number of reasons.\n Creating a hostile work environment is one.\n Discrimination based on religion is another.\n\n The same law-suits are possible for government as well.\n Can't a government employee sue for \"hostile work environment\"?\n Can't a government employee sue for \"discrimination based on religion\"?\n The government is not exempt for those law-suits, and if they were feasible we should see that approach tried whenever \"separation of church and state\" is violated.\n \n But the truth is that putting up a cross, saying that the boss is Christian, is an example of neither of those.\n \n Take a Christian book-store for example. Shouldn't those Christian book-stores be impossible to maintain by your approach? Shouldn't they all be vulnerable to law-suits for \"hostile work environment\" and \"discrimination based on religion\"?\n \n \n \nIt's also bad business practice for many to alienate people who have the only god you really care about...the little paper one that's been proven to work miracles.\n\n So the Christian cares more about the almighty dollar than professing his own faith?\n And the Christian doesn't care about the same alienation when it comes to our GOVERNMENT doing the alienating?\n \n Neither of those are positive insights on Christianity that wants to ignore \"separation of church and state\" while they refuse to take advantage of the lack of \"separation of church and business\".",

You'll not find a Chic-Fil-A that has ever been open on a Sunday. That's because Truett Cathy is a devout Christian man.\n \n http://www.truettcathy.com/\n \n \n 5. CLOSED ON SUNDAY\n \n \"I was not so committed to financial success that I was willing to abandon my principles and priorities. One of the most visible examples of this is our decision to close on Sunday. Our decision to close on Sunday was our way of honoring God and of directing our attention to things that mattered more than our business.\"\n \n Chick-fil-A is the only major fast-food restaurant chain to be closed on Sundays, one of the busiest days of the week in the restaurant business. Despite being closed on Sundays, Truett Cathy has led Chick-fil-A on an unparalleled record of 38 consecutive years of sales increases, with its core free-standing restaurants achieving higher sales per unit in six days (with shorter operating hours) than most major chains in the industry.",

   "Yep, the local hobby lobby's (hobby shop) the same way.\n Closed on Sunday.\n \n While my post may seem black and white, the issue isn't really.\n It's called niche marketing.\n Much like some businesses cater to the druggie and some cater the feminazi and some to the nerd or jock. If it helps your business, then do it. If it doesn't then don't.\n If you're doing it out of principal and it helps your business, awsome. If it doesn't and you stick to your guns, you'll be out of business soon.\n \n However, a generic business that secularly employs a lot of different people (think Home Depot Hardware) all of a sudden decides to toss up a huge cross on the lawn, they could end up facing said lawsuits.\n \n As noted, a government facility could also.\n \n It's the average zealot who often has a hatred for 'godless government' that wants to fight against the machine and force it to accept the revised Chistian-centered belief system that seeks to put such religious relics on government property.\n \n I personally think that many such relics of historic nature should be left alone. I'm thinking of the Mt. Soledad Cross in CA. as an example. Like a 'grandfather clause'.\n Afterall, statues of various 'law-givers' including a blasphemous (by Muslim standards) depiction of Mohammed is found in D.C. (SCOTUS courthouse iirc or similar).\n \n However, no new items should be added IMO.\n \n So, if you have that ancient religious document for 200 years ago mounted in the court house prior to all this 'seperation of church and state' hoola, leave it be until it falls down due to decay. But, add nothing new. \n \n My .02\n \n \n But, as isly ilwott states, many businesses do engage in religious posturing.\n And honestly, I have no problems with it for the most part. My son worked for Chic Fil A. \n I was close to being hired for a 2nd job at Hobby Lobby.\n I've worked for religious people and irreligious people whose stances were made known in the beginning.\n If my current job were to go fundamentalist with expectations that I participate in prayer meetings and mount a religious icon on my desk and greet people with 'The Messiah loves you!' I'd sue.\n I'd then kick back and live fat off my winnings.\n \n I pray daily for such to happen.\n \n Ironic isn't it. emoticon_xgood",
