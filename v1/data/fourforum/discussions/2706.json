I don't care one way or the other what you believe in. What's right is to permit people to do as they choose as long as it doesn't harm others. How would the recitation of a prayer hurt someone? [If the answer is that it might make them feel awkward or left-out, apply the same argument to the tattoos, green hair, pierced eyebrows and sloppy clothing...children who can't afford those things must feel left out...so let's ban them, too.]\n \n Official endorsement? I don't see anything in the original post that requests mandatory recitation of anything. The \"evil\" (your word) things listed seem to have just as much \"religiosity\" as prayer or a pledge have. \"You're not welcome in our group unless you do the same things we do\"...that snobishness is not perculiar to religion and does not represent how I feel about Christianity. I'm not here to save your soul or make you believe anything in particular.\n \n If all those \"evil\" things are permitted, why cannot prayer be permitted? Nobody tells children they have to pierce their noses and wear there pants below their crotches. Nobody tells them they have to get tatoos or dye their hair. They do this of their own free will or from peer influence...at school, at home...in all public places.\n \n So what's wrong with permitting prayer? What's wrong with permitting the Pledge? Let people choose whether to participate in these things just like they are permitted to choose the others listed.\n \n Is it that the atheists like Michael Newdow are afraid something \"evil\" will \"get to\" their children?\n \n (BTW-I didn't author the opening post...I just passed it along...as food for thought)",

If some kid wants to bow his head and give thanks before lunch--nobody will stop him. If another prays for divine wisdom before taking a test--nobody will stop her. Situations such as this have never, ever been part of the equation. \n \n Now if some child decides that an intregral part of their prayer is to wave snakes around the classroom--well, I think we can all agree that is crossing a line. But what if the most popular student in school, a great leader, and a positive role model to the other students, wants to lead a prayer before a test? \n \n What if instead of the student a coach wants to give the Lord's Prayer before a football game?\n \n What if the principal seeks the blessing of Allah everyday before school? \n \n Or if the teacher uses Buddhist meditation to help her students focus?\n \n Why should non-religious students be subjected to that environment? Are their rights to be free from religion any less important than their peers' rights to express religion? Alternatively, why should religious students be subjected to an evironment that is religion free? Are they any more important? Are they on equal footing?\n \n What is the reasonable middle ground? Rather than kvetching about what people cannot do, perhaps it would be more useful to examine what people should do in the presence of their neighbor?\n \n Whistler",

(Aside: I was once sneered at for refusing to join the KKK.)\n \n\n The difference is that no one was ever burned at the stake for not dying their hair. No one ever became a suicide bomber over nose piercing. Peer pressure is unpleasant. Having your feet crushed because you won't recant goes a bit beyond that.\n \n People go nuts over their religion. Not all people of course, but enough that you don't want to encourage them. When people start thinking that their nation follows a specific religion than religious persecution isn't far behind. You get people following God's law, rather than government law.\n \n Your KKK experience is actually a good example of this. They were a bunch of people with strongly held beliefs, who wanted you to do things their way. Now imagine what they would have been like, if the mayor of your town was openly biggoted. Or if kids were allowed to call blacks ni**ers in school. Or if jews were forced to use the back door to enter the courthouse. How much more emboldened would they have been?

   "The reason it's so important to keep religion out of public schools, or any part of the governement, is that it takes very little encouragement for some people to go from believing that their religion is right for them, to believing it's right, period. I've never seen a campaign saying that everyone has to dye their hair, or must celebrate Halloween in a certain way, but I have seen people try to change school curriculums, or ban books because they didn't agree with their religious views. It's been one of the great successes of this country that we've managed to keep people from imposing their religion on others.\n \n So just how dangerous is school prayer? Do you remember Judge Moore? He was the one who wouldn't remove the 10 Commandments memorial from the court house. 100's of his supporters said that he was right, because this is a Christian nation and if you don't like it you can go back where you came from. And to back up this claim they waved around dollar bills, which say \"In God we trust\". One little phrase on the back of a dollar, which doesn't even specify which God, and people were ready to overthrow the constitution and start a crusade. Yes, I know the phrase didn't cause their beliefs , but they were more than willing to use it to justify their beliefs. Now imagine that instead of just a phrase on the back of the dollar we start having our kids say the Lord's prayer in school. How many more people will be convinced that this is a Christian nation? And, being a Christian nation, non-christian views, ideas, and people aren't welcome? \n \n The founding fathers very wisely seperated church and state becasue they knew how passionate people can get about their religion, and they knew that if the government seemed to take sides people would take it as a sign of approval for them to impose their religion on others.\n\n \n You obviously have no problem with the word 'God' appearing on your currency.\n \n And also, it didn't specify 'which God' because it was taken as read that it's the God of the Christians... in the social context of when your nation was founded that the majority of American citizens, if they believed in any god, believed in 'God', (that is because they were Christian)\n \n Your founding fathers separated church and state not because they were anti-Church, but because they saw no need for government to use taxpayer money to support one particular church over another as was the case in Britain when you guys rebelled from them.\n \n Further to this, you have failed to demonstrate how Judge Moore's decision was dangerous. You've said 100 of his supporters said one thing... was this representative of all his supporters, or of him? Was what they did 'dangerous' per se? You've not stated facts in any of this, other than your opinion that it was dangerous.\n \n Further to this, as you were a Christian nation upon your founding and as you welcomed non-Christians into your nation then you sort of answer your own allegation about what 'evils' might befall America if taken over by Christians.\n \n Christianity gave you your laws (speficically I know of the law of tort of negligence; which protects you as an end-user of consumer products) so I don't know why the rant you seem to have against Christianity.",

   "I agree, that would be a bad reason to do it. And two years ago I would have said that any attempt to remove the phrase was silly. But since then I've seen a rise in fundamentalism in this country, with more and more people saying that this is a Christian nation, with no room for other ways of thinking. And these people will grasp at anything to justify their beliefs, even an innocuous phrase in the pledge. That's why I think it should be removed, not to placate the athiests but to slow down the zealots.\n\n \n America is a Christian nation.\n Of your population:\n Religions:\n \n Protestant 56%, Roman Catholic 28%, Jewish 2%, other 4%, none 10% (1989)\n http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html\n also at\n http://www.friends-partners.org/oldfriends/facts/usa.html\n \n Your maths is better than mine but even I know that 56%+28% is more than 50% (I would assume that 'other' also includes Orthodox Christians as we are neither Protestant, nor Catholic).\n \n You are a nation goverened by Christian laws. You need to get over this, and get on with your life.\n \n So, in effect, your changing your laws not to upset a minority of people. As you are a Christian country this actually argues well that Christians are in fact more tolerant than you give credit for.\n \n Christians have been influencing your nation (not always to the good), but it is undeniable..\n The USA had many Christian colonies at its founding. http://www.geocities.com/iconoclast...nstitution.html is an interesting site, because it's trying desperately to deny the Christian influence. For instance it recognises...'March 4, 1629 - The first Charter of Massachusetts read in part:\n \"For the directing, ruling, and disposing of all other Matters and Thinges, whereby our said People may be soe religiously, peaceablie, and civilly governed, as their good life and orderlie Conversacon, maie wynn and incite the Natives of the Country to the Knowledg and Obedience of the onlie true God and Savior of Mankinde, and the Christian Fayth, which in our Royall Intencon, and The Adventurers free profession, is the principall Ende of the Plantacion..\"\n \n But then counters by saying 'Let us now see the legal means the Christians of the Massachusetts Bay Colony enacted only a year later to achieve these goals: In 1630 it was made illegal to: \n \"shoot off a gun on any unnecessary occasion except an Indian or a wolf.\" [SH241]'\n \n So, their argument then is not that there was no Christian influence, just that it was limited.\n \n The Women's Christian Temperance Union wanted laws changed in regards to alcohol. This was achieved in the 1920s; showing that Christian pressure groups could influence law-makers along Christian lines. This influence of Christians is still being exerted on law.\n \n Your calendar, and some public holidays are influenced by the Christian world; so your whole fabric of nation is yearly influenced by Christianity. Are you advocating the removal of Easter, Christmas, and Thanksgiving? And, in a way, Halloween - as it is made in reference to the Christian days of All Souls, and All Saints.\n \n \"Justice Joseph Story and Chancellor James Kent were among many sitting judges during the nineteenth century who cited the maxim that \"Christianity is part of the common law.\" As early as 1764, Thomas Jefferson attributed the phrase to a misinterpretation made by Sir Henry Finch in 1613 that had subsequently been perpetuated by Matthew Hale and William Blackstone. But Justice Story disputed Jefferson's contention that it was a \"judicial forgery\" and quoted the opinion of Chief Justice Prisot of the Court of Common Pleas, which established the precedent in 1458: \n As to those laws, which those of holy church have in ancient scripture, it behooves us to give them credence, for this is common law, upon which all manner of laws are founded; and thus, sir, we are obliged to take notice of their law of holy church; and it seems they are obliged to take notice of our law\"*\n http://www.reformed.org/webfiles/antithesis/v2n2/ant_v2n2_law.html\n \n Here's some more, not necessarily positive influence...\n \"Following the ratification of the Constitution in 1788, the First Amendment and most state constitutions prohibited the establishment of an official religion. Nevertheless, states still occasionally prosecuted persons for blasphemy against Christianity.\n \n In a typical 19th-century blasphemy case, a man called Ruggles made highly insulting remarks about Jesus Christ and his mother, Mary. The state of New York tried and convicted Ruggles and sentenced him to jail for three months plus a $500 fine. Appealing his case, Ruggles' attorney argued that his client could not be prosecuted for blasphemy since there was no state law against it.\n \n In 1811, New York's highest appeals court unanimously rejected Ruggles' arguments. The court said that New York did not need a blasphemy statute. Ruggles' words violated the common law inherited from England, which made blasphemy against Christianity the law of the land. Based on this interpretation of the law, the New York court stated that reviling Jesus was a crime since it \"tends to corrupt the morals of the people, and to destroy good order.\" \n \n The court seemingly ignored that New York's state constitution prohibited the establishment of any government-sponsored religion. Nevertheless, most other states adopted this legal opinion. Although very few persons were prosecuted, blasphemy remained a crime in several states well into the 20th century.\"\n http://www.crf-usa.org/terror/rushdie.htm\n \n See also\n http://www.catholicculture.org/docs/doc_view.cfm?recnum=2883\n which has the classic example of Christian influence in the formation of modern law; the case of Donoghue v Stevenson",

   "In the \"Christian influence: modern law, and in the formation of the United States\" thread\n Post 1, I wrote...\n I will now show a trail of Christian heritage through English law leading up to the formation of the United States of America...\n \n Alfred the Great, one of the codifiers of the laws of England, swore treaties by God.\n \"With this army Alfred made a solemn treaty, to the effect that they should depart out of the kingdom, and for this they made no hesitation to give as many hostages as he named; also they swore an oath over the Christian relics, (21) which with king Alfred were next in veneration after the Deity himself, that they would depart speedily from the kingdom.\"\n http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/OMACL/KingAlfred/part1.html\n \n William the Conqueror began his collection of statutes by saying \"Here is shown what William the king of the English, together With his princes, has established since the Conquest of England. \n Firstly that, above all things, he wishes one God to lie venerated throughout his whole kingdom, one faith of Christ always to be kept inviolate, peace and security to be observed between the English and the Normans\"\n http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/lawwill.htm\n \n Henry II who codified the common law has his constitution of Clrendon state:\n \"The declaration of the above-mentioned royal customs and dignities has beenmade by the archbishops, bishops, earls, barons, and the nobler and older menof the kingdom, at Clarendon on the fourth day before the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, lord Henry being present there with the lord king hisfather. There are, indeed, many other great customs and dignities of holymother church and of the lord king and barons of the kingdom, which are notincluded in this writing, but which are to be preserved to holy church and tothe lord king and his heirs and the barons of the kingdom, and are to be kept inviolate for ever.\"\n http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/cclarendon.html\n \n King John's Magna Carta begins:\n \"John, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and count of Anjou, to the archbishop, bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justiciaries, foresters, sheriffs, stewards, servants, and to all his bailiffs and liege subjects, greetings. Know that, having regard to God and for the salvation of our soul, and those of all our ancestors and heirs, and unto the honor of God and the advancement of his holy Church and for the rectifying of our realm, we have granted as underwritten by advice of our venerable fathers, Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all England and cardinal of the holy Roman Church, Henry, archbishop of Dublin,\"\n http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/magna.htm\n \n Now it is important to understand the Magna Carta in relation to US law making\"\n \"It is impossible to understand the politics and activities of our day without an understanding of the history behind them. It is not only the right, but the responsibility, of a citizen to seek to understand one's government, one's relationship to it, and that government's relationship to the larger world. All governments, and all societies, are based on a system of laws. A constitution is a formal charter stating the laws of a nation and communicating that nation's structure, standards, and intentions, not only to its citizens, but to the larger world. The modern constitution is a device to express the foundations of the life and business of a political nation. It lends credibility to a government and defines how that government represents its people. Here is an exploration of recent documents that form our idea of what a constitution should be, and some of the constitutions that resulted.\"\n http://www.leftjustified.org/leftju...ht/wtp/wtp.html\n also\n http://www.crf-usa.org/Foundation_d...ation_home.html\n This site recognizes the direct influence of the Magna Carta on the formation of the United States. It also recognizes the import of the Mayflower Compact.\n \n Further, these examples up to this point quite unashamedly are Christian.\n \n Thus when the \"The Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress - 1774\" states\n \"That the inhabitants of the English colonies in North-America, by the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the English constitution, and the several charters or compacts, have the following RIGHTS:\"\n (http://www.leftjustified.org/leftju...tp/1cngrss.html) they are referring to the laws established and exampled above; those that mention the Christian God.\n \n The English Bill of Rights' first statement is one concerning religio the freedom to practice a Christian faith\n \"Whereas the late King James the Second, by the assistance of divers evil counsellors, judges, and ministers employed by him, did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the protestant religion, and the laws and liberties of this kingdom.\"\n http://www.constitution.org/bor/eng_bor.htm\n \n And \"in composing the (American) declaration (of Independence), Jefferson followed the format of the English Declaration of Rights, written after the Glorious Revolution of 1689.\"\n http://www.crf-usa.org/Foundation_d...declaration.htm\n \n Which is why it begins and ends with evoking the name of God\n \"We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights...\"\n \"And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence,...\"\n http://www.crf-usa.org/Foundation_d...dependence.html\n \n Even when Thomas Paine calls for religious tolerance, it's in a Christian context writing in \"Common Sense\" he states.\n \"As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensible duty of all government, to protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I know of no other business which government hath to do therewith. Let a man throw aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of principle, which the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to part with, and he will be at once delivered of his fears on that head. Suspicion is the companion of mean souls, and the bane of all good society. For myself I fully and conscientiously believe, that it is the will of the Almighty, that there should be diversity of religious opinions among us: It affords a larger field for our christian kindness. Were we all of one way of thinking, our religious dispositions would want matter for probation; and on this liberal principle, I look on the various denominations among us, to be like children of the same family, differing only, in what is called their Christian names.\"\n http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/paine-common.html",

   "AND In the \"Christian influence: modern law, and in the formation of the United States\" thread I gave a specific example of Christian influence on law formation in the modern era\n \n Post 5, I wrote...\n Actually within the common law world at large I'm thinking specifically of the tort of negligence which had its birth in the case Donaghue v Stevenson (1932), when Lord Aitken asked 'who in law in my neighbour?'\n \"If you were to ask lawyers from around the world to name the most famous tort case in legal history, they would say without hesitation Donoghue v. Stevenson.\"\n http://www.thepaisleysnail.com/information.shtml\n \n The idea of 'love thy neighbour' is an old one...\n Muhammad urges people to look after their brothers; by this he means other Muslims.\n The Jews had a similarly narrow outlook on 'neighbour'\n For Hammurabi, it was your immediate neighbour\n \n However, Jesus Christ ruled that all men are your brothers.\n \n The Jews had the 'eye for an eye' concept: Exodus 21:24; Lev. 24:20; Deut. 19:21\n They also had the 'love thy neighbour' concept: Lev. 19:18\n both of which Jesus touches upon in St. Matthew's Gospel\n \n Look at what He says in the Gospel of St. Matthew on the 'eye for an eye'.\n Mat 5\n 38 \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'\n 39 But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also\n \n That is, He's completely over-turning the notion of revenge! Next, what does He say about 'neighbour'?\n Mat 5\n 43 \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.' \n 44 But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, \n 45 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.\n \n Note He says \"you've heard this...\" then \"BUT I tell you...\". He's over-turning the rules of the past and preaching universal love.\n \n He repeats the message\n Mat 19\n 19 Jesus replied, \" 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honour your father and mother,' and 'love your neighbour as yourself.'\n \n Mark 12\n 28 One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \"Of all the commandments, which is the most important?\" \n 29 \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.\n 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'\n 31 The second is this: 'Love your neighbour as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.\" \n 32 \"Well said, teacher,\" the man replied. \"You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.\n 33 To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" \n 34 When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.\n \n Especially important is...\n Luke 10\n 25 On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. \"Teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" \n 26 \"What is written in the Law?\" he replied. \"How do you read it?\" \n 27 He answered: \" 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind' ; and, 'Love your neighbour as yourself.' \n 28 \"You have answered correctly,\" Jesus replied. \"Do this and you will live.\" \n 29 But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, \"And who is my neighbour?\"\n ....(see parable of the Good Samaritan at this point)\n 36 \"Which of these three do you think was a neighbour to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\" \n 37 The expert in the law replied, \"The one who had mercy on him.\" Jesus told him, \"Go and do likewise.\"\n \n He is not referring to a literal neighbour at all, but one who has concern for someone else.\n \n It is why St. Paul said...\n Romans 13\n 10 Love does no harm to its neighbour. Therefore love is the fulfilment of the law.\n \n Galatians 5\n 14 The entire law is summed up in a single command: \"Love your neighbour as yourself.\"\n \n And James said...\n James 2\n 8 If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, \"Love your neighbour as yourself,\" you are doing right.\n \n The prominence of 'neighbour' as being all men whom you might have some contact/influence with was the idea behind Lord Aitken's ruling...\n \n I shall give a bit of info about the case. Ms Donaghue attended a restaurant wherein she had a meal and a bottle of ginger-beer. The bottle was opaque (so you couldn't see the contents), and was still sealed (that it had come like that direct from the factory). She had some of the drink, then a bit more and noticed the decomposing bits of a snail inside the drink. She became ill. She took Stevenson to court (his company made the drink), however, it was the rule of law that as no contract existed between her and the drink maker, that she had no right under existing law (because the contract existed between the Stevenson and the restaurant, and then a contract between Donaghue and the restaurant.\n \n This case went all the way to the House of Lords. The minority ruling was against the applicant. That up till this point people were unprotected in law. Lord Buckmeister, one of the two dissenting Law Lords said basically \"There's no law protecting her, therefore it should be thrown out!\"*\n \n Commenting on a lower court... \"The Court below had proceeded on the general principle that in an ordinary case a manufacturer is under no duty to any one with who he is not in contractual relation...\"**\n 1932 Law Reports, House of Lords, p534. also cited as 1932 Law Reports 534\n \n However, speaking for the majority, Lord Aitken said... \"The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omission which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who then, in law, is my neighbour? The answer seems to be - persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.\" \n http://www.lawscot.org.uk/whatis/case5.html\n \n \"Doubtless, any lawyer vaguely familiar with the development of tortious liability appreciates the consequences of the decision handed down on 26 May....In order to reach that conclusion, it was necessary for the court to formulate a broad principle that went beyond the categories previously recognised. In fact, the specific categories were replaced with a principle so wide in scope that it laid the foundation for the modern law of negligence.\"\n Thooher, J \"Still silvery on its diamond jubilee? On the trail of that elusive snail\" in Law Institute Journal Vol 66 [1992] 379\n \n \"In the House of Lords, her appeal was upheld. What interests us here is the very practical application made by Lord Aitkin of Christ's teachings.\"\n http://www.catholicculture.org/docs...cfm?recnum=2883\n \n \"For the Christian Church, it was the legal affirmation of the basic moral precept that one should \"love thy neighbour\" or at least not to do anything to hurt him or her...\"\n Thooher, J \"Still silvery on its diamond jubilee? On the trail of that elusive snail\" in Law Institute Journal Vol 66 [1992] 382\n \n Once this had been established by the ruling in the House of Lords (where the case was heard), it had an immediate effect on all courts within the common law world; including America through 'persuasive effect'.*** From this, legislators began to enact laws protecting the end user of products... to those that owe a 'duty of care' to the end user.\n \"This decision was immediately accepted in England as a milestone in the development of common law - as recognising a 'tort of negligence... Donoghue v Stevenson has had almost revolutionary importance to the common law world as a whole. The trail of the snail leads from London to Adelaide, from Ottawa to Singapore.\"\n Smith, T B, \"British Justice: The Scottish Contribution\" (1961), pp51-52\n \n \"The case established the general principle of (tort of) negligence, that is, that persons who have some relation or proximity owe a duty of care to each other. Since it was established, this precedent has been further refined and applied and referred to in thousands of fact situations where a person complains of physical harm to their person or property.\"\n http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/repor...nsf/pages/clr_4\n \n \n *Lord Buckmesiter said \"Now the common law must be sought in law books by writers of authority and in judgments of the judges entrusted with its administration. The law books give no assistance...There can be no special duty attaching to the manufacture of food apart from that implied by contract or imposed by statute.\"\n \n **There were two legislated exceptions...\n a) when the product was of its nature dangerous (e.g. TNT)\n b) when the article is dangerous to the knowledge of the manufacturer.\n \n ***persuasive effect is where a court deals with a new issue, it will look to similar courts rulings within similar jurisdictions, and if not, to further afield.\n \n \n Appendix\n The original text of the case can be found at\n http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm",

Now go and read Monty's posts, both in this thread and others.

Not likely, but not unlikely enough to ignore. Again, read Monty's posts. See how readily he twists what people say to support his position? See how he warps logic to show that his conclusion is the only possible correct one? Any shred he can find he pounces on in an attempt to bolster his ideas. And he's not alone. The fundamentalist movement is growing. Take a look at the state of education in Kansas for an example. Every time I hear a fundamentalist say that we're a nation under God, his interpretation of God, that's just one more reason to pull the phrase out of the pledge.\n \n So, I agree with your position that we shouldn't change the pledge just to cater to the sensitivites of a small group.

   "Matthew 23:16\n \"Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.'\n \n St.Peter used one\n Matthew 26:72\n He denied it again, with an oath: \"I don't know the man!\"\n \n Hebrews 6:16\n Men swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument.\n \n Hebrews 6:17\n Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath.\n \n Hebrews 7:22\n Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.\n \n \nIf you wouldn't post so hastily, you will see that I quoted the verses from Matt. 5.\n\n \n Well that is also what I referred to, as well.\n \n \nOk, here's a prime example of a christian bending the bible to his whim, twisting the words to satisfy his modern day sensibilities. When Jesus says \"one should not swear an oath since it is the words of the evil one,\" I would take that to mean that he is clearly forbidding that practice. Somehow, you do not.\n\n \n Why not quote \n Matthew 18:9\n \n And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.\n \n \n \n And demand I poke my eye out!\n \n or\n \n Mark 9:43\n \n If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell , where the fire never goes out.[ 9:43 Some manuscripts out, 44 where / \" 'their worm does not die, / and the fire is not quenched.'] \n \n \n \n Isn't that then you twisting words too? Are you a Christian? I am, and I follow the church that put the Bible together. We don't believe in just depending upon Bible verses, but reading the Bible in the context of the Church. You picking out a single verse and deciding to interpret it the way you want, as opposed to me relying on the wisdom of 2,000 years of church teachings is I believe an example fo you twisting the words, not me.\n \n Mat 5\n 33\"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.' 34But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; 35or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. 36And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. 37Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.\n \n He is saying let your word be your bond. He is also saying that when you say 'yes', be honest in this. I believe His emphasis is on honesty, not the wording of a phrase.\n \n \nRight, because that had to do with paying taxes. What does this have to do with taking an oath?\n\n \n It is not literally about paying taxes. It is about obeying the laws of the land. If the laws of the land require you to make a pledge, then so be it. When Jesus says don't swear an oath He is saying let your word be your bond. Almost invaribaly if I say something someone will ask \"Is that right?\" because people don't just accept us at our word. I could make a big song and dance about it, and say \"How dare you question my word\", but if they ask me to promise, then I will. Oaths aren't really given for the benefit of the person making it, but for the person receiving it; because they believe by the additional promise to make for a more binding contract.\n \n It runs in line with...\n Ephesians 6:5\n Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.\n \n Titus 3:1\n Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good,\n \n \n TERTULLIAN \n APOLOGY. \n [TRANSLATED BY THE REV. S. THELWALL, LATE SCHOLAR OF CHRIST'S \n COLLEGE, CANTAB.] \n THE APOLOGY. CHAP. I.\n CHAP. XXXV.\n And this at the very time they are shouting, \"May Jupiter take years from us, and with them lengthen like to you,\"--words as foreign to the lips of a Christian as it is out of keeping with his character to desire a change of emperor. But this is the rabble, you say; yet, as the rabble, they still are Romans, and none more frequently than they demand the death of Christians. Of course, then, the other classes, as befits their higher rank, are religiously faithful. No breath of treason is there ever in the senate, in the equestrian order, in the camp, in the palace. Whence, then, came a Cassius, a Niger, an Albinus? Whence they who beset the Caesar between the two laurel groves? Whence they who practised wrestling, that they might acquire skill to strangle him? Whence they who in full armour broke into the palace, more audacious than all your Tigerii and Parthenii. If I mistake not, they were Romans; that is, they were not Christians. Yet all of them, on the very eve of their traitorous outbreak, offered sacrifices for the safety of the emperor, and swore by his genius, one thing in profession, and another in the heart; and no doubt they were in the habit of calling Christians enemies of the state.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian01.html\n \n He is arguing here that there were people making elaborate pledges to the safety of the emperor, but at the same time this did not make for honesty. See also\n TERTULLIAN \"ON IDOLATRY\".(especially CHAP. XVII.--THE CASES OF SERVANTS AND OTHER OFFICIALS. WHAT OFFICES A CHRISTIAN MAN MAY HOLD.) where he shows concern for a Christian trying to work for a pagan state (remember the Roman Empire was pagan), and taking office involved swearing an oath by a pagan god.",

   "This is a study any sociologist can do...It is a typical way of creating someone as the bogey-man.\n \n \nJim, you asked for the definition of \"zealot.\" I give you Monty.\n\n \n This ad hominem is an attempt by Kronus at group formation.\n \n \nJim, I think we have similar values. \n\n \n An appeal to common ground in order to form an alliance. You are trying to make Jim feel he is on common ground with yourself. Kronus is trying to establish the limits of the group to include Jim, but to exclude me. Why would Jim want to be part of Kronus group...? let's see...\n \n \nWe both think people should be able to do what they want as long as they're not hurting anyone, and we don't want to be told what to do unless it's for a good reason. \n\n \n Setting yourself up as a font of normality, and now... the creation of 'the Other'.... Thus the 'Kronus group' includes the rational, and the excluded are the irrational.\n \n \nNow go and read Monty's posts, both in this thread and others.\n\n \n Generalised attacks without recourse to facts. Appealing to bigotry. An attempt to make me 'the Other', that is, he that is opposed to you 'the Normal'. It's again trying to define one group as opposed to the other.\n \n \nI have little doubt that if he and his kind were in charge school prayer would be mandatory, Muslems and other undesirable religious types would be deported or worse, the teaching of evolution would be illegal, etc etc.\n\n \n Further trying to pigeon-hole me as 'the Other' a nemesis out to rob you right-thinking people of freedoms etc. Appeals to more bigotry as you create a stereotype. If he could actually cite me saying what he alleges he'd do so. But why appeal to facts? Kronus is here about making an emotive cry for friends.\n \n \n Even if you agree with some of his ideals on principle I'm guessing you don't want them shoved down your throat, you don't want someone forcing you to follow them. \n\n \n Appeal again for alliance, that even if Jim is in agreement with me on some issues, you suggest that I am by far worse and undesirable (by being unreasonable). Further, there is a generalised attempt to suggest that I support 'forcing people' to do something... another factless and highly emotive rant.\n \n \nSo, I agree with your position that we shouldn't change the pledge just to cater to the sensitivities of a small group. How do you feel about what I said? Valid concern, or should I start fitting myself for a tin-foil hat?\n\n \n The odd thing here is you now agree with what I have maintained... the will of the people. But, when creating groups, one need not appeal to rational thinking, and here Kronus does not.\n \n He's listed me as a bigot and a zealot. He's done absolutely nothing to address any facts regarding the formation of the USA as a Christian country, nor about the formation of the law (with regard to a specific example). Instead he simply rant about how evil he thinks I am, and mistakes opinion for fact.\n \n I have advocated that if the majority of Americans choose to have a pledge, then what gives the right of anti-Christian bigots to suggest that they are better than the majority and seek to over-turn the collective and democratic will?\n \n \nHow likely is this to happen? Not likely, but not unlikely enough to ignore. Again, read Monty's posts. \n\n \n A return to generalised concepts 'somewhere else' Montalban has done these unspecified evils... Which posts? I have debated here for almost a year on everything from getting the USA out of Iraq, to the removal of guns from everyone's homes etc.\n \n \nSee how readily he twists what people say to support his position? See how he warps logic to show that his conclusion is the only possible correct one? Any shred he can find he pounces on in an attempt to bolster his ideas. \n\n \n Debating me in this post might actually help his cause. I note that he doesn't do that. He has offered actually not a shred of debate against me on this thread.\n \n \n And he's not alone. The fundamentalist movement is growing. \n\n \n Yes, the bogey-men are all around you. Appeal to paranoia.\n \n \nTake a look at the state of education in Kansas for an example.\n\n \n I have never been to Kansas, and don't know anyone there. I have in fact never been to the USA. I live in Sydney, Australia. Still, being part of a world-wide Christian Fundamentalist conspiracy isn't easy! emoticon_xgood \n \n \"People are attracted to a group when they feel that the relationships offer more rewards than those in other groups.\"\n Ritzer, G (1996) \"Sociological Theory\" (4th Ed.), p413\n \n Here we have seen Kronus attempt to create a group that includes like-minded people - hence he's appeal that he and Jim have common ground. This group however would be one rather shallow one as it's 'leader' has yet to actually engage in debating with me the topic at hand.\n \n \nEvery time I hear a fundamentalist say that we're a nation under God, his interpretation of God, that's just one more reason to pull the phrase out of the pledge.\n\n \n Ah-ha! At last, an ounce of idea. Which God do you believe the majority of Americans believe in? I've already demonstrated that the over-whelming majority are Christian. You provide absolutely no refutation of this fact, instead, you offer this long-winded appeal to bigotry with liberal doses of paranoia. So much for the triumph of the rational mind!\n \n In effect your whole post is not an attempt at refuting anything I've said, but a blatant appeal to one other poster in an unconscious desire to form a social group - probably based on one's own low self-esteem (based on the fact that no refutation was able to actually be brought forth). I enjoy studying the people on this forum. One other poster simply ignores most of what I write, in order to facilitate his own sense of 'wit'.",

I am not an anarchist. I don't mind some laws telling me that I can and cannot do certain things. You definition of hurting someone may be different from that generally accepted.\n \n \n Now go and read Monty's posts, both in this thread and others. \n\n You are trying to manipulate me.\n \n \n I have little doubt that if he and his kind were in charge school prayer would be mandatory, Muslems and other undesirable religious types would be deported or worse, the teaching of evolution would be illegal, etc etc.\n\n You did not spell \"Muslim\" correctly. (That's not an opinion...that's a fact.)\n \n You did not punctuate the sentence adequately and are likely in need of training in that regard.\n \n You consider Muslems (sic) to be of an undersirable religious type.\n \n \n\n Even if you agree with some of his ideals on principle I'm guessing you don't want them shoved down your throat, you don't want someone forcing you to follow them.\nHere you are pointing out the obvious. This can be said of most people.\n \n \n\n How likely is this to happen? \nThe question is not clearly defined. How likely is what to happen, that Monty becomes in charge?\n \n \nNot likely, but not unlikely enough to ignore. \nYou like rhetorical questions.\n \n \n Again, read Monty's posts. See how readily he twists what people say to support his position? See how he warps logic to show that his conclusion is the only possible correct one? \nAgain, you are trying to manipulate me.\n \n \nAny shred he can find he pounces on in an attempt to bolster his ideas. \n He is likely bolstering his argument, not his ideas. Good debaters generally do this...find flaws in the opponent and expose them to the judges.\n \n \n And he's not alone. The fundamentalist movement is growing.\n You have characterized Monty as a fundamentalist without defining the term. It is fundamental to do so in an unbiased way. Is he a religious fundamentalist, a legal fundamentalist or what?\n \n \nTake a look at the state of education in Kansas for an example. Every time I hear a fundamentalist say that we're a nation under God, his interpretation of God, that's just one more reason to pull the phrase out of the pledge.\nThis is fundamental to your next quote and my response to same.\n \n \n\n So, I agree with your position that we shouldn't change the pledge just to cater to the sensitivites of a small group.\n\n You are in a small group (atheist, according to another post of yours) and you say that every time you hear a fundamentalist say..., that's just one more reason to pull the phrase out of the pledge.\n \n Those two segments appear to contradict each other. \n \n \nHow do you feel about what I said?\n\n I believe you are confused, wondering if you're right about the existence of God and eager to have more people on your side.\n \n \n Valid concern, or should I start fitting myself for a tin-foil hat?\nOnly if is an equalateral pyramid.

Yes I have not experienced it first hand, so can not honestly talk of that side of things. But that does not stop the discussion of the ideology behind such a system surely.\n \n \n \nI do remember in fifth grade, there was a girl who did not stand up with the rest of the class every morning. I asked the teacher why she could get away with it (afterall, the pledge to kids is more of an annoying chore than anything) and I was told that because of her religion (7th day adventist, or was she muslim, I don't remember) she didn't have to do it. Of course, I said right then that MY religion also forbade it. Pat, pat, 'sure it does, get back to your desk and recite the pledge now...'.\nAnd in fact it appears that I may be just as qualified after all in a way. For unfortunately England doesn't have such a brilliant idea of separation of church and State. Hence most state (read 'public') schools start the morning off with compulsory group prayer and hymns. Again the Muslim kids were excluded from this but my protestations that I didn't believe in, and in fact objected to the enforced, idea of God met with exactly the same reaction.",

First of all, it seems that what is required hasn't been cleared up yet.\n \n Many people have said that if you don't believe in god or the pledge to just not say them. I happen to be lucky enough to live in a school district where we have the right not to say the pledge and to sit quietly rather than stand. I believe everyone should know about the case that recently went through court about the girl being forced to say the pledge in some other district. There they were forced to stand and recite the pledge. Earlier someone said they can't give you detention for not saying the pledge, well that's true as far as I know but there are some districts who will suspend you.

   "OK I'm new here but I want to give my opinion on this topic. First of all, it seems that what is required hasn't been cleared up yet.\n\n \n Welcome to these boards. I don't know with whom you are addressing, but just for fun, I'll take a shot at answering you.\n \n \nMany people have said that if you don't believe in god or the pledge to just not say them. I happen to be lucky enough to live in a school district where we have the right not to say the pledge and to sit quietly rather than stand. I believe everyone should know about the case that recently went through court about the girl being forced to say the pledge in some other district.

Our school doesn't force us to stand (but this was only after a large batch of complaints and discussions with the principle and this had nothing to do with under god either).\n\n \n I don't think people should be forced to say it. They should have a choice. That also means that they have the choice to say it.\n \n \nNow the social standpoint: From kindergarten, kids are told to stand and recite the pledge. They aren't told of any alternative, they are just told to do it. And of course they listen to their teachers. After a few years they actually find out they don't really have to say it. Think again.\n\n \n That's what generally happens in schools. Teachers teach. Most countries attempt to instill some sense of civic pride in their pupils. It's often deemed part of making for a well-rounded person - civic responsibility - after-all, its the taxes of the majority paying for the education. If you want a private education then you need - private education.\n \n \nI have experienced many kids being made fun of, verbally attacked, physically bullied, etc. because they don't \"love America\" and they \"hate freedom\". These kids don't understand anything, they just are told these things from parents and teachers that you should salute the flag if you love America.\n\n \n Aren't these bullies using freedom of expression? (I'm only stirring)\n \n \n By high school generally it's cooled down physically but there are still people who will tell you to \"salute your country\".\n\n \n I do actually find having any form of national 'pledge' odd, we don't have one for schools here, but some are trying to indroduce one. You are a nation seen as being big on external displays of patriotism.\n \n \nEven without under god there is no reason to recite the pledge every day.\n\n \n What time-frame would you suggest?\n \n \nWe don't have to love our country to live here.\n\n \n You mean, take all the advantages, but none of the responsibilities? (or else, why not leave?) I love my country, and as someone in love, I recognise it has (many) faults. That doesn't mean I want to abandon it.\n \n \nBut I want to take it even further. We should not have to listen to the pledge every single day. These are public schools. We are forced to go because we need an education. These schools are for education and should not set aside time for \"patriotic exercises\".\n\n \n Would you discontinue teaching history? It might be construed as a patriotic exercise. So would English if you are forced to read works by American authors instead of those of the great Nepalese writers in English.\n \n \nIf they want to recite the pledge during lunch (45 minutes is plenty of time for a 15 second pledge) than go right ahead. Get your own group of patriotic Americans that will recite the pledge. You can even start a pledge club that meets every day to show how American you are. Do whatever you want but other kids shouldn't have to listen to you pledge your allegiance to the country we live in.\n\n \n Mmm?\n \n \nAnd I'm fed up with this \"The minority shouldn't have the say over the minority\" ****. You said this isn't what a democracy should be well if you knew enough you'd know that the US isn't a democracy, but a republic.\n \n Definition of republic:\n a political system or form of government in which people elect representatives to exercise power for them.\n\n \n Actually you're supposed to be a democratic republic. The two aren't mutually exclusive. As Australia is a federation, a Commonwealth, a democracy, and a constitutional monarchy none of these being mutually exclusive either.\n \n \n We elect officials and they exercise power.\n\n \n That suggests a democracy then doesn't it?\n \n \nAlso, talk about minority and majority. If I could get the majority of people to say that all blacks (a minority) had to pay us a \"black tax\" would you like that. You'd call me a racist (actually I would too) and you wouldn't care about majority. the fact is that the constitution matters more than what the majority of the people think.\n\n \n That's one of the paradoxes facing democracies.... can a democracy be a democracy if it, by will of a majority, persecutes a minority? \n Churchill said\n \"Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those others that have been tried.\"\n \n (NOTE: it's a paradox for democracies, not republics)\n \n If you're interested there's a site that's got some good arguments against democracies (I don't support this site but thought as you're against democracies, you'd get a kick out of it...\n \"WHY DEMOCRACY IS WRONG\"\n http://web.inter.nl.net/users/Paul.Treanor/democracy.html\n \n \n \n There happens to be a law in there prohibiting congress from passing a law respecting the establishment of religion.\n\n \n Yes, that means that the state shall not sponsor a religion. It's often cited as being for complete religious freedom, but that's historically wrong... as the Supreme Court ruled in the Mormon's case - the Mormons argued that the Bill of Rights gave them the right to have polygamy (see Appendix)\n \n \nI think it is such BS when people like Bush say \"under god isn't a religious statement, just a verification of the faith we have in a supreme being\".\n\n \n What do you think 'God' means? Do you believe he has made something tangible like a can of Pepsi his god?\n \n \nYou are claiming that this nation is \"under god\". \n\n \n Actually Lincoln used the words 'under God' (see quote post #66)\n \n \nWe are not under god whether he exists or not.\n\n \n If He didn't exist, then you wouldn't be under Him. If He does exist, then (unless you have a different definition of God to the majority of Americans), you would be under Him.\n \n \nWe are under a president, the supreme court, the senate, the house of representatives, and all state and local governments.\n\n \n And they are under God... as defined by most Christians to be all-powerful. Everyone and everything is under God.\n \n \nWe are not under god and having an officially sanctioned pledge being forced to recite every day saying the words \"under god\" is saying that god is above this nation.\n\n \n That would conform with most people's ideas of God... being above a nation.\n \n \nAnd to whoever said we'd have to change the declaration of independence, that isn't the law. That was a letter written to the queen of England.\n\n \n I think England had George III and he wasn't in any sense a queen. Still, it's a good indication of the frame of mind of those who were wanting liberty for all.\n \n \nWith money, I totally agree, in god we trust should be taken off. We as a nation do not trust god. Individuals can trust god all they want, but this nation cannot affirm there to be a god.\n\n \n The nation are the individuals in it, and the majority of individuals in it are believers in God. As a nation that upholds the ideas that the will of the people is paramount (at least that's what you guys advertise), then you must abide by the majority decision - unless you're appealing to a higher authority - such as God.\n \n \n Appendix\n Reynolds v.

I wouldn't expect people to conform to the teachings of my religion if they chose not to. America was founded on the premise that all men (and now expanded to included women) are created equal. Granted we haven't always done the best job practicing what we preach but, and this is an important but, we have continually striven to reach this ideal. Barriers have been torn down that exclude some or relegate others to second-class citizenry. Now some people, for the purposes of this discussion I specifically mean fundamentalist Christian types (although there are other groups with similar agendas), are working very hard to institutionalize their ideas and beliefs, and themselves by extension, as more noteworthy or important than those of other people. That is, creation of unequality.\n \n The very nature of this action goes against the whole premise of American equality and freedom. No longer are laws or rules designed for the benefit of the common good irrespective of religion. Rather they are designed or implemented specifically with one religion in mind while their proponents proclaim, \"because our religion is so good for us, it must be good for everyone else too.\" I forcefully reject that proposition because that is not the kind of country I want to live in. \n \n That is the problem with religious fundamentalists trying to wheedle their influence into political matters.\n \n Whistler",

You don't so much argue as sing a jingo. \n\n \n \n I don't know if they have a fundamentalist movement in Australia per se, so I don't how much you know about it.\n\n \n Yes, we have a full representation of views. I know what I think on the matter; I'm not here to debate me; I want to know what you think, and why you think it.\n \n \n The first thing you need to try to understand is that Fundamentalist and Christian are not identical terms. The reason I haven't stated \"why you think Christianity's influence is bad\" is that I never said it was. You jumped all the way from \"I don't want Fundamentalists to be in power\" to \"Christian influence is bad\". You see how those two statements don't say the same thing? Do you?\n\n \n I do. However, having stated numerous times that I am Orthodox (it's also on my profile), you call me a fundamentalist. If you call an Orthodox a fundamentalist for spouting Orthodox Christian views, then ipso facto you are deeming the views of the second largest Christian group as fundamentalist... this is not to say that I am a spokesman for Orthodoxy - however I have uses various references from Orthodoxy on issues ranging from Abortion to Creationism etc (and you made vague references to 'some other posts' that you believe Jim should read as a prime example of a zealous fundamentalist.) You could of course try to find fault with my arguments to say that they are not in fact Orthodox, but you don't; you simply equate my Orthodox views as being fundamentalist.\n \n \n As for why I think having Fundamentalists in power would be a bad thing; it's quite simple. However, don't think that I'm trying to convince you here. I know I won't. You just asked why I think they way I do and I'm telling you.\n\n \n Are you saying that you know my views on the matter? Here I was thinking I was the only person I know who knows. But then you do mistake me for being a 'fundamentalist'. If anyone wants to know my views, I suggest now that they ask either you or I.\n \n \n Fundamentalists think that final authority rests with God.\n\n \n I would think most Christians believe this. You see it's hard to know if you really are talking about 'fundamentalists' or all Christians. What is wrong with people believing that authority rests with God? Billions of people do; not just Christians.\n \n Are you a student of Nietzsche? I know he talked of (or was grossly mis-quoted) when he talked of a 'super-man' (not to do with the comic book).\n \n \n Thus, a Fundamentalist government would say it's doing God's will, or at least what those in charge say is God's will. I want a government where the highest authority is a person, whose decisions can be questioned and challenged.\n\n \n I think what you are saying here is that a theocracy is inherently dictatorial (in a bad sense of the word - as opposed to a 'benevolent dictator'). I'm not sure that this is true as I do know that the European states of the Middle Ages through to the Age of Enlightenment were very Christian orientated, and these are the same nations that gave birth (during those same times) to democratic institutions etc... viz, the Parliament of England etc.\n \n Australia is not a fundamentalist nation, but we have God referred to in our Constitution. So again, I don't know what your problem is. You can believe in God as the final authority, but not need be a fundamentalist.\n The preamble reads:\n \"WHEREAS the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland; and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and under the Constitution hereby established:\"\n http://www.dpmc.gov.au/docs/constitution.cfm\n \n Just as a little side-note...\n I'm not sure if you'd be interested, but there was a debate in Europe on whether or not to mention God in their constitution...\n http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCulture.asp?Page=\\Culture\\archive\\200302\\CUL20030204b.html\n \n \nTake a look at history and you'll see that religious governments are particularly intolerant of dissent. I don't need to agree with everything the government says, but I want the right to disagree without fear of charges of heresy.\n\n \n Many different forms of government aren't happy with dissent... look at secularist nations such as; North Korea, Cuba, China, the former Soviet Union, the former regime of Pol Pot in Cambodia.\n \n I do suspect you are anti-religious as you seem only to suggest this happens with theocracies.\n \n What government doesn't have a person in charge of it?

After this raid, St. Louis received much attention back in Spain, since the Spanish flag was raised above St. Joseph, proclaiming all the land below Lake Michigan belonging to \"His Most Catholic Majesty the King of Spain.\" Never again was St. Louis threatened by foreign attack and the valley of the Illinois river became claimed by Spain in 1783.\"\n http://www.usgennet.org/usa/mo/county/stlouis/attack.htm\n \n I suspect that the Dutch had some type of 'Protestant' title too.

   "Here's a few of the documents that powered the machine of revolution...\n \n James Otis, The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved (1763)\n \"It is . . . true in fact and experience, as the great, the incomparable Harrington has most abundantly demonstrated in his Oceana and other divine writings, that empire follows the balance of property. 'Tis also certain that property in fact generally confers power, though the possessor of it may not have much more wit than a mole or a musquash: and this is too often the cause that riches are sought after without the least concern about the right application of them. But is the fault in the riches, or the general law of nature, or the unworthy possessor? It will never follow from all this that government is rightfully founded on property alone. What shall we say then? Is not government founded on grace? No. Nor on force? No. Nor on compact? Nor property? Not altogether on either. Has it any solid foundation, any chief cornerstone but what accident, chance, or confusion may lay one moment and destroy the next? I think it has an everlasing foundation in the unchangeable will of GOD, the author of nature, whose laws never vary. The same omniscient, omnipotent, infinitely good and gracious Creator of the universe who has been pleased to make it necessary that what we call matter should gravitate for the celestial bodies to roll round their axes, dance their orbits, and perform their various revolutions in that beautiful order and concern which we all admire has made it equally necessary that from Adam and Eve to these degenerate days the different sexes should sweetly attract each other, form societies of single families, of which larger bodies and communities are as naturally, mechanically, and necessarily combined as the dew of heaven and the soft distilling rain is collected by the all-enlivening heat of the sun.

But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The question before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.\"\n http://www.pointsouth.com/csanet/greatmen/henry/henry1.htm\n \n \n The Virginia Declaration of Rights (A document which Thomas Jefferson had in mind when writing the Declaration of Independence)\n June 12, 1776\n ...\n XVI \"That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator and the manner of discharging it, can be directed by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and therefore, all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is the mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\"\n http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/D/1776-1800/independence/virdor.htm\n (it's taken as read that people believe in God!)\n \n Even when Thomas Paine calls for religious tolerance, it's in a Christian context writing in \"Common Sense\" he states...\n \"As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensible duty of all government, to protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I know of no other business which government hath to do therewith. Let a man throw aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of principle, which the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to part with, and he will be at once delivered of his fears on that head. Suspicion is the companion of mean souls, and the bane of all good society. For myself I fully and conscientiously believe, that it is the will of the Almighty, that there should be diversity of religious opinions among us: It affords a larger field for our christian kindness. Were we all of one way of thinking, our religious dispositions would want matter for probation; and on this liberal principle, I look on the various denominations among us, to be like children of the same family, differing only, in what is called their Christian names.\"\n http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/paine-common.html",

   "Yes, the French helped a great deal. So did the Spanish. It was Burgoyne's defeat, caused by his ignorance and pride, that enabled Benjamin Franklin to talk to the King of France and get support from them. Prior to this, the King would not receive Franklin. He needed proof that the rebels could put up a good fight.\nYou are quite right. As long as you are not under the opinion that we lost the war because every British army officer is a bungling toff who goes round burning down churches because of his inherent evil I'm happy.\n \n As for John Burgoyne, I think he was partly a scapegoat. Saratoga was such a disaster due to the poor rout chosen that led him to be badly short of supplies. This then coupled with some disastrously unlucky losses of supplies, communications, reinforcements and the diversionary force meant he decided to force the battle rather than starve.",

Your answer suggests that neither his points are taken, but that the French help was supreme to both. You didn't separate either the God-help or the Brit-bungling issues that you were replying to.\n \n Now you say that they all had God influence - So what's your problem?

France was so un-democratic that within the century the people there rose and killed their king. Spain was no democratic model either.\n \n Further to that, after taking their help, you stole West Florida of the Spanish.\n \n Also, having gained French help you offered none to help (that I'm aware of) that same king who'd helped you. You didn't help your pro-democratic brothers in France either.\n \n Basically you got all the help, and offered none.\n \n Then you go around calling Ben Arnold a traitor, yet from another war, you don't call Robert E.

   "Welcome to these boards. I don't know with whom you are addressing, but just for fun, I'll take a shot at answering you.\n \n \n I don't think people should be forced to say it. They should have a choice. That also means that they have the choice to say it.\n \n\n They should have the right to say it. But the school shouldn't give them school time to say it. We are forced to go to school to learn, not be patriotic.\n \n \n\n That's what generally happens in schools. Teachers teach. Most countries attempt to instill some sense of civic pride in their pupils. It's often deemed part of making for a well-rounded person - civic responsibility - after-all, its the taxes of the majority paying for the education. If you want a private education then you need - private education.\n \n\n Interesting you bring that up, I was from a private school up until this year (9th grade) and we didn't have the pledge. But having civil responsibility doesn't have anything to do with saying or hearing the pledge. Loving our country is different from following our rules and laws.\n \n \n\n Aren't these bullies using freedom of expression? (I'm only stirring)\n \n\n Actually I've wondered about that. I don't think threats should be allowed, but calling names is punishable in school yet it doesn't hurt anyone.\n \n \n\n I do actually find having any form of national 'pledge' odd, we don't have one for schools here, but some are trying to indroduce one. You are a nation seen as being big on external displays of patriotism.\n \n\n I agree, there's no point to a national pledge and I'm very annoyed with the people who are so big on patriotism. Be patriotic but don't go on making a big deal about it. But if you want to, that's your freedom.\n \n \n\n What time-frame would you suggest?\n \n\n I don't understand your question, I would say people should say it on their own time.\n \n \n \n\n You mean, take all the advantages, but none of the responsibilities? (or else, why not leave?) I love my country, and as someone in love, I recognise it has (many) faults. That doesn't mean I want to abandon it.\n \n\n It's not a responsibility to love your country, and not having a pledge is different from abandoning a country.\n \n \n \n\n Would you discontinue teaching history? It might be construed as a patriotic exercise. So would English if you are forced to read works by American authors instead of those of the great Nepalese writers in English.\n \n\n I never said anything about not having it just because it's patriotic, but because that's the only point. We are learning (the point of school) through history and english by any authors. If we wanted to do a lesson on the history of the pledge or on anything about the pledge I would have no problem. But saying it for the sake of patriotism is wrong.\n \n \n \n \n\n Actually you're supposed to be a democratic republic. The two aren't mutually exclusive. As Australia is a federation, a Commonwealth, a democracy, and a constitutional monarchy none of these being mutually exclusive either.\n \n\n I agree, but in a total democracy we would vote on every issue, instead we elect officials to make the decisions we think would be in ours and the country's best interest.\n \n \n \n \n\n Yes, that means that the state shall not sponsor a religion. It's often cited as being for complete religious freedom, but that's historically wrong... as the Supreme Court ruled in the Mormon's case - the Mormons argued that the Bill of Rights gave them the right to have polygamy (see Appendix)\n \n\n You have freedom of religion before it infringes on the rights of others, \"Your right to punch me ends at my nose\".\n \n \n\n What do you think 'God' means? Do you believe he has made something tangible like a can of Pepsi his god?\n \n\n God:\n supreme being: the being believed in monotheistic religions such as Judaism, Islam, and Christianity to be the all-powerful all-knowing creator of the universe, worshiped as the only god\n \n This is different from god which could be a pepsi can. There's a difference between god and God.\n \n \n\n Actually Lincoln used the words 'under God' (see quote post #66)\n \n\n What Lincoln said is irrelevant. Actually he can say this all he wants. That's his right. How does this pertain to saying it in a school on school time? Actually say it in school all you want but we shouldn't allocate time for it.\n \n \n\n If He didn't exist, then you wouldn't be under Him. If He does exist, then (unless you have a different definition of God to the majority of Americans), you would be under Him.\n \n\n I don't know what you would define under as but I think if I were under God I'd know.\n \n \n \n\n And they are under God... as defined by most Christians to be all-powerful. Everyone and everything is under God.\n \n\n As I said, I think I'd know if I were under God.\n \n \n That would conform with most people's ideas of God... being above a nation.\n \n \n \n\n I think England had George III and he wasn't in any sense a queen. Still, it's a good indication of the frame of mind of those who were wanting liberty for all.\n \n\n OK, so I don't know much about British history emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \n\n The nation are the individuals in it, and the majority of individuals in it are believers in God. As a nation that upholds the ideas that the will of the people is paramount (at least that's what you guys advertise), then you must abide by the majority decision - unless you're appealing to a higher authority - such as God.\n \n\n If I could convince the majority of the people to force blacks to pay the majorities money because they're black (we are a MAJORITY) would that be right?

I said that as an Australian I find it an odd custom, and that it's probably not good for here.

I do believe that as a citizen of a nation, taking advantages of the counrty, and when the country is not particularly a bad nation, then one should love one's country. I do agree that a pledge does not necessarily equate to this, but as an Australian I say that - because in our frame of reference it is a foreign notion. However, in the USA you are big on public display and show - even away from Hollywood. Saying a pledge might well be an appropriate cultural practice.\n \n \n Would you discontinue teaching history?

   "Is it mandatory? What law/regulation can you cite? I don't doubt you, but I would like to see the provisions for myself.\n\n \n I too would like to see the law that requires kids to say the pledge of allegiance. Someone correct me, but I don't think there is any such law. But, kids are nonetheless forced by their teachers, principals, and other authority figures to do it. Refusal would surely be seen as defiance of authority and would most likely result in some sort of \"correction.\" It's not so much law as it is school policy (in almost every single school).\n \n Here is discussion of removing \"under god\" in the senate. http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/26/pledge.allegiance/\n Why is the senate even considering that forcing the kids to say the pledge is constitutional? I don't even know if it's technically UNconstitutional to force kids to say it, though.\n \n More on the same: http://pewforum.org/religion-schools/pledge/\n This quote troubles me: \n \"I am disappointed with the court's action,\" said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. \"Students should not feel compelled by school officials to subscribe to a particular religious belief in order to show love of country. America is increasingly diverse in matters of religion, and our public schools should reflect that diversity.\"\n  \n Students should not BE compelled to love their country at all, nor should they FEEL compelled to do so either. It's funny that the end goes \"with liberty and justice for all.\" Where's the liberty in forcing some 6 year old to say something he/she doesn't even understand?\n \n This is more informative: http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/cs/blcs_jw_flag1.htm\n \n Ah! It's a court thing, not an act of congress thing:http://atheism.about.com/library/decisions/religion/bl_l_MinersvilleGobitis.htm\n Here is the last of it that says it all for me:\n This decision described the case as a balancing of conflicting claims of liberty and authority. The school's interest in creating national unity was, in their opinion, more important than the rights of the students to refuse to salute the flag. The needs of authority won out over the needs of liberty - a familiar tune in American history.\n \n So, there is no written law that requires kids to say the pledge, but a court will not uphold a kid's right not to say it (without setting precedence).\n \n Whoa, look at this one: http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/cs/blcs_jw_flag2.htm",

   "\n Further, in a public school you get what the majority of the public want - and in the USA public displays of patriotism are more common. I see this by the number of people who fly flags from their houses. Here I don't know anyone in my suburb, or neighbouring suburbs who fly the national or any other flag (except for football teams)\n \n\n That's not what a public school should be. The majority of the people wanted segregated schools, even after the court ruled against it there was violence, yet the law is no segregation based on race\n \n \n\n I'm certain that you don't mean this - it's badly phrased.\n \n\n \n\n Loving our country is different from following our rules and laws.\n \n\n How is this badly phrased? Loving America is not the same as following America's laws and rules. We can follow the rules and laws even if we don't love our country.\n \n \n \n\n That's not exactly what I said. I said that as an Australian I find it an odd custom, and that it's probably not good for here. However, that's not to say that it's not right for your nation - which is a nation more on 'display' and 'show' so a pledge seems more 'American'.\n \n\n I'm just saying I agree that it's an odd custom. I guess not odd because it's common here but I mean we should not do things for the sake of 'display' and 'show'.\n \n \n \n\n I meant to ask do you want the pledge every second day or once a week, then? What time-frame would you suggest?\n \n\n I don't understand what you're saying. I would not want that or the way it is now, I told you the time-frame I would suggest, none at all.\n \n \n \n\n But you learn patriotism through history, and even through judicious selection of works in English. I see your problem with it is that it is a way of socialisation that is more in your face. You seem not to have any problem with methods of socialisatiom in other forms; probably you are unware that these other lessons are in fact socialising forces.\n \n\n Patriotism isn't necessarily bad. But in history, we are learning and we don't learn, \"be patriotic\" or \"patriotic people are good\". I don't really have a problem with learning stuff with patriotic content but doing something just for the sake of it being patriotic shouldn't be done.\n \n \n \n\n And it is the will of your people to vote for people who want the pledge.\n \n\n Yes, but the people we vote for also have to follow the constitution, which also prohibits establishment of religion. This isn't a Christian nation even if every single person in it is Christian. This nation has (or should have) no establishment of religion by the government.\n \n \n \n\n How's a group of people in a polygomous relationship infringe on you? Yet, your nation has consistantly ruled aginst it. I don't hear people rallying around in support of the Mormons.\n \n\n I agree, they should be allowed to have polygomous relationships if they want to, just as homosexuals should be able to marry.\n \n \n\n And one nation under God is with a capital 'g'\n \n\n That's what I was saying, it was the specific God and not something one worships such as a pepsi can.\n \n \n \n\n It's pertinent if you have a large number of Americans believing in God.\n \n\n The first amendment guarrantees \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\".\n \n \n \n\n The God most Christians believe in is a God who is above your nation.\n \n\n same as above, we have the first ammendment.\n \n \n \n\n It's not the issue if you alone believe or not.

I think it is such BS when people like Bush say \"under god isn't a religious statement, just a verification of the faith we have in a supreme being\". You are claiming that this nation is \"under god\". We are not under god whether he exists or not. We are under a president, the supreme court, the senate, the house of representatives, and all state and local governments. We are not under god and having an officially sanctioned pledge being forced to recite every day saying the words \"under god\" is saying that god is above this nation. And to whoever said we'd have to change the declaration of independence, that isn't the law. That was a letter written to the queen of England.

And that happens to be legal right now (protest AND refusing to pledge allegiance) but saying the pledge doesn't mean you love your country either. People sometimes say it mindlessly to avoid confrontation and you can not say it although you love your country.\n \n \n\n I didn't say we would have  to change the Declaration of Independence. I was asking whether we should erase the word Creator from it if we did change the Pledge of Allegiance. I was making a statement on the inclusion of God in our founder's thinking and a proof that our country and government was not void of God in the beginning. God did not come into public life with the Pledge of Allegiance, he was always there. There is no establishment of religion with many of these practices, there is simply \"free exercise thereof.\"\n \n\n The declaration of independence was written to the king of England. We shouldn't erase creator because that's what he meant. I don't care if the writers wanted to talk all about God, it's their right. Just as in conversations you can say god. Setting aside public time to pledge to a country under god is not acceptable. This is a government-sanctioned pledge and you're trying to tell me this isn't an establishment of religion. Forcing everyone from age 5 to 18 to hear that their country is under God is not right. It gives them the idea that it's right and that athiests, other religions without God are wrong. Actually, I think repitition is the best method of brainwashing. Hearing an opinion pounded into your head for 13 years? I think there's about 200 days in a school year, so people are forced to hear this roughly 2600 times before they're out of high school. If that's not brainwashing, what is?\n \n \n\n I pledge allegiance to the Flag\n of the United States of America,\n and to the Republic for which it stands:\n one Nation under God, indivisible,\n With Liberty and Justice for all.\n\n Pledge all you want. Do it when you go to bed, when you get up, when you eat breakfast. Do it during passing periods at school, at lunch. At the end of the day. Before dinner, after dinner, say it all you want. But giving time for the pledge of allegiance during school shouldn't be allowed.",

   "I think king Louis still needed your help. So, you're saying that the help payed for by France was like a long-term loan? \n\n \n \nI'm not familiar with Louis' need for help.\n\n \n He needed help, because the people revolted against him. He's the same guy who gave you aid - and as you say at the end of this post, he wasn't the most tyrannical dude, you say Britain can claim that title.\n \n \n Further, you helped France because it helped you to do so. Germany declared war on you - to stop them you needed to strike at Germany, and France was a good way of doing this. If you were in it to 'save France' you'd have been there a few years earlier, don't you think? \n\n \n \nAre you saying you understand exactly why France helped the US in the Revolution? I think it was more that they hated the British than loved the rebels. Plus they may have seen an opportunity for financial gain.\n I do thank them for the Statue of Liberty.\n\n \n I am happy to accept that all nations act in their own self-interest. So, you can drop the \"We saved your asses\" argument if you are suggesting America acts for benevolent reasons. But can you? Nope, because in a short while you'll do exactly that...\n \n \n If it weren't for the Russians, you'd probably be speaking German! (a statement that's just as valid as yours considering the number of German divisions they held off compared to you guys) \n\n \n \nSpeculation. Russia did little in the Atlantic War which is what crippled the Germans the most. They lost the Bismarck and the U-boats and Allied shipping tonnage went back up. The Russians merely kept the Germans occupied with war on the Russian Front. I think they were absent from Normandy.\n\n \n Ah, lack of insight based on a false dichotomy - not understanding the implications of 'world' in 'world war'.*\n \n When the Germans lost the Bismarck it was in 1940, well before the US entered the war.\n \n The Russians were absent from Normandy, but that's a very limited view of a 'world war'. By holding down hundreds of divisions in the east they prevented the western allies from being wiped out. I'm not suggesting that the Russians did this out of a great desire to save American lives; for it served their interests too that the western allies were successful.\n \n It is an act of extreme poor taste not to recognise the importance of the millions of men they sacrificed to the war effort. It is not speculation. It is fact governed by proofs with regard to the total amount of German divisions facing the Russians (an indicator that to them, the real threat lay there), as compared to those facing the combined allied expeditionary force (US, Brits, Canadians, Free French, Poles) (from memory I believe there were 40 German Divisions in the West and several hundred in the east- but I do recall that the ratio is indicative to the great and real threat the Germans felt from the Russians).\n \n This is not to say that the US involvement in the 'world' war wasn't 'great'. However your quip about \"The French would still be speaking German\" is but a jingo that appeals to the notions that Americans have about themselves, and that is divorced from the reality that Russia contributed the major force in Europe, which itself was seen as the most important theatre of war - as opposed to that in Burma, or in the Pacific. (which is why the US put 9/10ths of their resources into fighting Germany)\n \n \nHowever, how's that explain you ripping Florida off the Spanish? Or the fact that you appealed to these fine examples of tyranny in the first place? \n\n \n \nIn the days of colonization, no country was much more tyrannical than GB.\n\n \n And how does this explain you ripping-off Florida from the Spanish?\n \n Only two nations have declared their independence from Britain; the United States in 1776, the other Rhodesia in 1970. All the other colonies were granted their independece. Unlike the Dutch who fought to control Indonesia after WWII, and the French in Indo-China, Alegeria et al.\n \n What measure are you using?\n \n \n \n *It reminds me of the campaign against the Japanese in New Guinea. Every time the US had a victory Macarthur had it reported as \"US Victory\", any time we had a victory he insisted it was reported as \"US and Allied Victory\"",

   "Further, in a public school you get what the majority of the public want - and in the USA public displays of patriotism are more common. I see this by the number of people who fly flags from their houses. Here I don't know anyone in my suburb, or neighbouring suburbs who fly the national or any other flag (except for football teams)\n\n \nThat's not what a public school should be. \n\n \n Why? If the public want it to be that way, why not? They obviously do - you've got what people want.\n \n \nThe majority of the people wanted segregated schools, even after the court ruled against it there was violence, yet the law is no segregation based on race\n\n \n Then why aren't the schools still segregated if that's the will of the people? I think you'll find that the majority of people don't want segregated schools - which is why they're not segregated.\n \n \nI'm certain that you don't mean this - it's badly phrased.\n\n \nLoving our country is different from following our rules and laws.\n\n \n \nHow is this badly phrased? Loving America is not the same as following America's laws and rules.\n\n \n Is it difficult to see that someone who loves their country follows the rules?\n \n \nWe can follow the rules and laws even if we don't love our country.\n\n \n Then what are you doing there then?\n \n \n That's not exactly what I said. I said that as an Australian I find it an odd custom, and that it's probably not good for here. However, that's not to say that it's not right for your nation - which is a nation more on 'display' and 'show' so a pledge seems more 'American'.\n \n \nI'm just saying I agree that it's an odd custom. I guess not odd because it's common here but I mean we should not do things for the sake of 'display' and 'show'.\n\n \n How long have you had the custom? And yes, from an outsider's point of view, you are a nation big on show.\n \n \n I meant to ask do you want the pledge every second day or once a week, then? What time-frame would you suggest?\n \n \nI don't understand what you're saying. I would not want that or the way it is now, I told you the time-frame I would suggest, none at all.\n\n \n Ah, it's just originally you said 'not every day'.\n \n \n But you learn patriotism through history, and even through judicious selection of works in English. I see your problem with it is that it is a way of socialisation that is more in your face. You seem not to have any problem with methods of socialisation in other forms; probably you are unaware that these other lessons are in fact socialising forces.\n\n \nPatriotism isn't necessarily bad. But in history, we are learning and we don't learn, \"be patriotic\" or \"patriotic people are good\". I don't really have a problem with learning stuff with patriotic content but doing something just for the sake of it being patriotic shouldn't be done.\n\n \n I see. You are unaware of the patriotism being taught to you. When you read American books, in all subjects, when you watch American sports, see American films, learn American history -then you are in fact being socialised. You're just unaware of it.\n \n \n And it is the will of your people to vote for people who want the pledge.\n \n \nYes, but the people we vote for also have to follow the constitution, which also prohibits establishment of religion. This isn't a Christian nation even if every single person in it is Christian. This nation has (or should have) no establishment of religion by the government.\n\n \n We're now back to the 'Mormon's Case' that I gave you heaps of court citations for. It is the way of your nation that the Bill of Rights in this case - religion - is not an absolute freedom. Another example would be with regards the \"Children of God\" (aka \"The Family\") which believe in sex with children. It is not their absolute right to do whatever they want in the name of religion.\n \n \n How's a group of people in a polygamous relationship infringe on you? Yet, your nation has consistently ruled against it. I don't hear people rallying around in support of the Mormons.\n\n \nI agree, they should be allowed to have polygamous relationships if they want to, just as homosexuals should be able to marry.\n\n \n Your system of government does not agree with the former proposal. You are supposed to be in a democracy, and how it works, shows that religious freedom is not an absolute freedom.\n \n \n It's pertinent if you have a large number of Americans believing in God.\n\n \nThe first amendment guarantees \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\".\n\n \n That's what it says, but how is it interpreted? See the various Mormon's cases. Laws need to be interpreted, and put in context, and in your nation, the people to do that are the courts and they judge otherwise. And in this case the majority are happy, as I don't hear in the news of waves of people protesting in favour of polygamy.\n \n \n The God most Christians believe in is a God who is above your nation.\n \n \nsame as above, we have the first amendment.\n\n \n Same as above... it's not an absolute freedom.\n \n \nIt's not the issue if you alone believe or not. You live in a democracy. Most people in it a Christian. Most believe in a God who is above your nation. Will of the people!\n\n \n [QUOTE=zachvac]As I said, the people we elect are also supposed to \"defend the constitution\". As I said, if the will of the people held true, we would still be in slavery and Al Gore would be president.\n \n Slavery? It was once 'lawful' so the people 'upholding the constitution' upheld slavery. It was in fact Christians, arguing against the law, and appealing to the notions of a higher law that urged the ending of slavery. Many anti-God people argued that they had no right to infringe on another's commerce - and slavery was commerce.",

   "Zachvac,\n \nYes, it definately is. It is our right to be or not be patriotic. It's our right to love or hate the government, the country, and all it stands for and still live in this country.\n\n If you hate the government and all  it stands for then you will not have the any rights, not even the right to hate. For this government and country guarantees those rights. That's why it should be loved. But disagreeing with the government for some of what it stands for would be okay.\n \n \nThat's true, and as I said I went to private school up until high school. But you have to pay money to get into a private school and not just any parent can home-school. But we should be provided with a public school system that doesn't try to get us to love something. If they want to teach us history, math, or other stuff, we are actually learning something, but for them to try to convince me to love my country during the school day is unacceptable.\n\n No, a public school should not get us to love \"something.\" It should not allow us to love just \"anything.\" And it should avoid letting us love \"nothing\" at all. It should not get us to love \"something\" it should get us to love our country. The country that provides the schooling, the opportunity afterwards to use the education gained from that schooling in the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness. It may even be more important than math, history, and other stuff.\n \n \nIf we have treasonous Americans that is a clear sign to the government that something needs changing, just as millions of people assembling peacefully in protest and a speech by Martin Luther King jr. \"I have a dream\". With a mass protest or treasonous people that shows that reform is needed. Not to say treasonous activity should be legal if breaking another law other than peacefully protesting.\n\n So a person is required not to do things in order to maintain his allegiance to his country? How can the government put these requirements on someone? How can the government force them to be patriotic and not treasonous by abstaining from certain activities? And if the government can require us to abstain from certain activities for the good of the country then why cannot it require us to perform certain activities for the good of the country like saying the pledge (and paying our taxes, and obeying laws, etc).",

My point is (and bear in mind I must depend on my faith in Him in order to live) that if God turned his back on us, even the whole earth, there would be total chaos. Just because He is control of all things does not mean He is a puppet master. No, He does not control the minds of the mighty, but neither does He control the minds of the weak. He does not write the laws of man, but has instilled in us His ways so that we will do that which is for the good of  all mankind. Without His influence, without His Spirit, mankind would be just animals. Because of his influence, not control.\n Many religions claim that God is in control of their thoughts. I don&#8217;t concur.

Eve would not have chosen Satan (the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil) and would have chosen Christ (the Tree of Life).\n I could write a book on this, Kronus.\n \n God&#8217;s control resides in His will for us as His children, not as slaves.\n \n Is that as clear as mud?

   "All education is a part of socialising \n\n \n \nI quite agree. However I think it is a bit much too call the pledge 'education'. To teach a kid respect for his elders as you say I totally support. But I think the way to educate as such is through history and literature. Not some brainless chanting. I just don't think it actually teaches anything.\n\n \n There we differ on 'education'. I think everything you learn at school is part of your education -even seeing a bad teacher will influence you.\n \n \nI would not judge American culture by Australian cultural standards, so in short, \"no\". I am not at all trying to make the argument that what one nation does, another should too. We have a different ethos.\n \n \nOf course not, I didn't think you were making such an argument, I was just wondering.\n\n I see Americans all the time say \"God Bless America\" etc. And it just seems to be 'normal' for them... except for a few on this board who somehow are annoyed to be associated with someone as nice as God. :)\n \n \n I have said before that the US is more a culture of the 'big show' the outward affirmations of patriotism - hence people who fly their nations flag at home, or put yellow ribbons around trees etc. Very few Australian fly our flag at home.\n\n \nWhile I agree you aren't as bad as the Americans at it, one thing that actually did strike me the most living there was how many Australians did go in for the overt patriotism there on a much greater scale than I expected. Certainly much more than us Brits do. \n\n I think our patriotism is concentrated on sporting events as we continaully beat you in almost everything (except last years World Cup). We beat you at cricket, rugby league, hockey, etc. :)\n \n \nI don't really have a point there, and I agree that I don't think a pledge would be appropriate at all for Australia either. I was just commenting...\n\n All intelligent comments are always welcome.",

   "I only started looking at this thread recently, mainly bc I'm not American, and don't really give a rat's arse what Americans want to \"pledge allegiance\" to. However, I have family who live in the States, and I remember being really shocked to find out that they had to recite a pledge to a flag every day. And me who hated having to sing Oh Canada on rare school assemblies- I imagined this going on every day!\n \n \nRepitition is how you learn to remember songs, poems, tables and other stuff worth remembering.\n\n The fact is that repetition of any ideological statement is indoctrination. Repetition is a way of getting past the critical part of the brain, because the familiarity makes it \"invisible\". Thus, you don't need to understand why you need to \"love your country\", or \"democratize Iraq\", or buy Drooble's Best Blowing Gum- you are just to do it, automatically and uncritically.\n \n \nIn`doc`tri`na'tion\n Noun 1. indoctrination - teaching someone to accept doctrines uncritically\n teaching, pedagogy, instruction - the profession of a teacher; \"he prepared for teaching while still in college\"; \"pedagogy is recognized as an important profession\"\n brainwashing - forcible indoctrination into a new set of attitudes and beliefs\n inculcation, ingraining, instilling - teaching or impressing upon the mind by frequent instruction or repetition\n\n \n If the US school system really wanted to teach children some positive socializing values, they would have the kids recite positive affirmations or something.\n \n \nMindless chanting isn't accomplishing anything and we shouldn't keep it for the sake that it's \"tradition\".\n\n Unfortunately, it is accomplishing something.

Perhaps that will dillute things, if lesser peoples intermingle and she needs things to be kept pure. Red power!\n \n Mizmaxx also, in her anti-Western/Christian crusade launches relativist arguments to defend Isalam (on another thread), whilst attacking Christianity. When I fight fire with fire, she gets upset (see below)\n \n Relativism bites back...\n She talks about the God of the OT being violent but at\n http://www.godchecker.com/pantheon/...=37&Submit.y=13\n there's tonnes of Indian war-gods\n \n She was aghast at Lot, who slept with his daughters\n There are incest stories in Native American society too, so again your lack of insight on this is frightening. (you haven't really addressed the last lot of examples from Native American culture)\n \"Another French scholar, Laura Makarius, works in the same structuralist tradition. She associates Coyote with impurity and qualifies him as \"symbolical of incest\" (Makarius 1973a:173). The culture hero of the Menominee, Manabozo, accepts his brother being killed in order to institute the midewiwin ceremony for the good of humanity, a breach of blood taboo, performed for magical purposes. Makarius comments, \"The contradiction between the individual and asocial character of the violation of taboo, and its perpetration by the trickster for the benefit of society as a whole, is the essence of the trickster myth\" (Makarius 1973b:668). Perhaps, but only in this myth spread among Central Algonquin peoples.\"\n http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodh.../trickster.html\n \"An interesting intertwining of insect behavior and human sexuality is found in the Mothway myth of the Navajo. In the Mothway legend, a bisexual god named Begochidi was leader of the butterfly people and serviced the sexual needs of both male and female butterflies. However, when Begochidi decided to leave the country, the butterfly people decided to commit incest rather than marry outsiders. This made the butterfly people \"go wild\" which is currently manifested for example, in the tendency of moths to rush into flames. The basis for the Mothway myth is the widespread concern about incest in small, isolated groups. Thus, the Mothway legend is to Navajos an explanation of the prohibition against sibling and clan incest\"\n http://www.insects.org/ced4/mythology.html\n also\n http://www.innu.ca/myth.html\n \n Uncleanliness\n Mizmaxx cites Leviticus 12:1-5\n I cite this interesting little conversation...\n \"It's your period!\" I chuckle, pretentiously. \"You're taboo! Indians isolate menstruating women. They regard them as unclean, with dangerous powers.\" \n \"You're stupid!\" she scoffs. \"Indians will welcome me; they're my people.\" \n I yank some old textbooks off my shelf, to bolster my point. \n \"Menstrual fluid pollutes the world,\" I laugh, paraphrasing page 371 of Harold Driver's Indians of North America.\n \"Tribes will cover you with a blanket!\" I cackle, perusing James Frazer's, The Golden Bough, page 599. \n \"You're forbidden to pound acorns, enter sweat lodges, attend ceremonies, or mingle with hunters or shamans,\" I chortle, narrating the Smithsonian's Handbook of North American Indians, and Oglala Women by Marla Powers.\n http://www.gettingit.com/article/677\n \"Many Native American societies publicly celebrated a girl's first menstruation. For instance, the parents of girls among the Luise\u00f1o Indians of Southern California proudly announced to the community that their daughters were becoming women. The girls were partly buried in heated sand. They were not permitted to scratch themselves or eat salt, and they were given instructions by older women about the physiological changes that were occurring and how to behave as a woman and wife. For most North American girls today, public announcements that they had begun menstruating would be considered humiliating. However, it was a matter of personal and family pride in many Native American cultures.\"\n http://anthro.palomar.edu/social/soc_4.htm\n \"Starting with a girl's first menses in Native tradition, a woman's bleeding time was honored as inherently sacred, a spiritual calling her body made visible. \"Ancient mythology/spirituality envisions the fragile, vulnerable and utterly perishable body as indistinct from soul.\" (3) During her moon time, so called because it occurred during the darkness of the new moon, she was relieved of her daily responsibilities by family and relatives to spend these 4-5 days resting, praying, being cared for in the moon lodge tipi with other women.\"\n http://www.ofspirit.com/florencegaia1.htm\n \"...women on their Moon Time do not participate in Lakota ceremony...\"\n http://www.buffalodreaming.com/lakota.html (anyone can judiciously edit).\n \n Rape and other assault as a result of spirtuality\n Mizmaxx cites Deuteronomy 22:23-27, and Leviticus 19:20\n I cite\n \"The Native American family is an extended one that includes aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, as well as adopted relatives. The nuclear family of mother, father, and children is considered a household within the family. Native American families are very close. If domestic violence occurs, the family is expected to take care of the problem. If a Native American woman goes outside the family for help, she is ostracized by her family and the batterer's family.\"\n http://www.msnusers.com/WomenandAbu...ricanwomen.msnw\n also\n \"Native American spirituality can be a source of profound support, comfort, and healing for many battered women. According to Karen Artichoker, co-author of Domestic Violence Is Not Lakota/Dakota Tradition, it can also serve to keep them in abusive relationships. The idea of connectedness to the earth and to each other is frequently used by the batterer and other family members as a reason for the woman to remain in a violent relationship.\"(Ibid.)\n Probably why\n \"Native American women experience the highest rate of violence of any group in the United States\"\n http://www.libertadlatina.org/nativ...%20violence.htm\n \n The value of men and women.\n Mizmaxx cites Leviticus 27:1-7\n I cite \n \"Native women performed so many tasks that to the settlers, they appeared to be slaves. For example, the title on this 1880s stereocard is 'Women's rights' followed by the elaboration: \"An Indian's idea of the same. Showing two squaws sitting beside their Teepe [sic], resting after carrying the wood seen beside them . . . while their leige [sic] lords and masters, (the noble red men,) are smoking.?\n http://photoswest.org/exhib/gallery4/daily.htm\n \"In the past, in all tribes women were valued for their skills. They brought forth the future nation and contributed as much as 80% of the labor needed to produce the family food supply.\"\n http://www.ldb.org/indheal.htm",
