I wouldn't get to caught up in Haliburton's financial reporting. Their contracts are costing you many billions of dollars regardless of how they want to spin their balance sheets. Anyone with a basic knowledge of accounting knows that the higher you can make your expenses, the lower your \"profits\" and tax liabilities. Remember, salaries are part of expenses, and I'm sure if Dick Cheney's was/is any indication of how they pay themselves throughout the company, it's easy to show modest returns. Regardless of how they're using all that money up over there, it's still costing us the same multi-billion dollar tax burden here at home. In addition, since they operate in many different countries, I wonder if they are required to report all revenues here in the US. When a company is operating on your donations, do you really want them to show large profits? Wouldn't that mean they could have done the work for less money??",
