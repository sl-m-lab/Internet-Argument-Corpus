   "Where is our faith? We proclaim to have faith in the second coming of Christ. When faith takes over our souls began to move through the unction of our holy spirit. It is this motion of the holy ghost that separates us from the world. For the soul of the world is dead in sin, and the world walks by sight, rather than by faith. \n \n Yet, our souls have come alive through the blood of Christ. We have become new creatures, old things are passed away and all things become new. We don't think or act as the world that is around us. The world should look at us as the reflection of Christ. The world hated Christ, and he told us that the world will hate us too if we pick up our cross to follow after him. \n \n Christ walked by faith trusting in his Father's word. He disregarded everything that was around him. No matter how cruel the world treated him, his last words were \"Father, forgive them for they know not what they do\". We too must forgive the world as we began our walk of faith. We are in the world, yet not of the world.\n \n So, it's time now for us to be like Christ. If we are ashamed to be as Christ, then he too will become ashamed of us. Let us not be ashamed to walk by our own faith. \n \n 2Cor5 [17] Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\n \n Amen!",

   "The souls of men come alive in contemplation of the almighty because he/she designed us that way. Our foremost purpose in life is to foster a constructive relationship with our creator.\n \n It is only natural that anything, no matter how flawed (such as Christianity) which turns our gaze towards 'he who was, is, and shall always be' will cause us to come alive with the merest proximity to truth. Thus even flawed religions may elevate a person's soul by activating his most profound sense, the sense of the divine.\n \n It is Flawed to say that \"we are in the world, but not of the world\". Without humanity to carry out God's unique mission, the whole of creation would be purposeless. Everything which is part of creation is in some way a lesson to be learned, a message to be heard, or a good to be enjoyed (in the appropriate manner) such that we can say in honesty and conviction how glorious God's creation is.",
