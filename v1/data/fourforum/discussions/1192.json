Social climate in post WWI Germany all but guaranteed a dictatorship based upon nationalism, revanchism and/or socialism would emerge. IF this were INEVITABLE, the net benefits of getting into the leadership of the NSDAP, which would allow an individual to exercise restraint upon the leadership and at least somewhat lessen the suffering of the war, might outweight direct opposition.\n \n The problem is that this would mean death during the Night of the long knives.\n \n Now, applying the same logic again, siding with Himmler&co would likely DEMAND action against the Jews as the Night of the long knives was the victory of NSDAP over NSDAP. The following actions would therefore be aimed at avoiding an extermination policy. Unfortunately, the best I would expect to be realistically achievable would be the delegation of Jews to second class citizens and confiscation of their property.\n \n Next, we face the problem of revanchism. Avoiding the war would be nice, but if war is, once again, INEVITABLE, then the aim would be achieving a separate peace as soon as possible. A possible moment would be just before Battle of Britain. Also, DEFINITELY avoid attacking the USSR, no matter what. Common sense here.\n \n \n The problem is this: WE can theoretize like this here due to our hindsight. For the people who actually did these things, specifically Hitler, this was not so. To us, it is an equasion between X.XXX.XXX dead in our history vs YYY.YYY dead after our intervention (a nice dream, wouldn't it be), the intervention being aimed atlimiting the INEVITABLE to a minimum. Also, we speak of cartainity. The YYY.YYY dead would still weight on our souls, but balance out by the X.XXX.XXX who we \"saved\".\n \n To Hitler, the equasion was X.XXX.XXX dead for the achievement of nationalist and revanchist goals.
