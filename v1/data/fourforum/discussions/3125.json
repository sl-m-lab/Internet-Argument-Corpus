   "Does Big Business hate capitalism? \n \n Examples: \n \n United Airlines & Governmet welfare\n Walmart's anti-competition activites\n Microsoft's litteral crusade aganist using non-microsoft software anywhere\n\n \n There's a valid arguement in that, but I would assume it's not the bulk of them.\n \n What's ironic is that many big businesses/subsidies were/are one of the prime reasons why government continuely grows. I'm not suggesting that all big corporations are this way (nor the majority), but many prominate companies do favor anti-capitalism laws. \n \n It's easy to understand why, because they're encapable of competiting without force. I find them highly immoral, and lazy.",

   "Does Big Business hate capitalism? \n \n Examples: \n \n United Airlines & Governmet welfare\n Walmart's anti-competition activites\n Microsoft's litteral crusade aganist using non-microsoft software anywhere\n\n \n I think the ultimate outcome for a regulated society is fascism. It is not necessarily socialism or communism. You have some good examples Duo:\n \n Government Welfare: Some companies receive tax money for various reasons. For instance many companies receive money for overseas advertising. What is the effect of the welfare? It frees up money that would normally be used by the company for overseas advertising can now be spend putting the smaller competitors out of business. \n \n Anti-competitive activities: We probably disagree on this one. I don&#8217;t think there should be anti-trust laws. That is a very big subject.\n \n Microsoft: They have a monopoly. They were granted one via patent and copyright laws. \n \n I think the ultimate outcome is fascism. There will be very few companies. \n \n Most corporations don&#8217;t like regulations, so they say. Regulations benefit the larger corporations. How??? Because of scale, compliance takes less resources per revenue dollars. For instance: If two companies have to hire another employee to comply with a regulation, who is burdened the most, a company with 100,000 employees or a company with 10? \n \n I think big business does hate capitalism. They like fascism more, IMHO.",

   "Anti-competitive activities: We probably disagree on this one. I don't think there should be anti-trust laws. That is a very big subject.\n\n \n Do you consider activities that are designed to run every competitor into the ground who can't absorb losses as well as you, and then jack up prices anti-competeitive? \n \n Anti-trust laws...it is a very big subject. \n \n Government Welfare disgusts me. If your business model, pardon my french, SUCKS, it's not the government's problem. Poorely designed business models should die. \n \n \nMicrosoft: They have a monopoly. They were granted one via patent and copyright laws.\n\n \n True, but there are good sides of their monopoly. Can you imagine 150 companies all releasing OS software and trying to make it all mesh together? \n That gives me headahes just thinking about it. \n \n \nI think the ultimate outcome is fascism. There will be very few companies.\n\n \n fascism is a political system, not a economic one. It is a anti-idelogy. I suppose being anti- this and that would qualify, but i'm not so sure. \n \n \nIf two companies have to hire another employee to comply with a regulation, who is burdened the most, a company with 100,000 employees or a company with 10? \n\n \n More likely the 100,000. A large company usually has the economic breathing room to manauver, as well as a working business model and large sums of reserve cash. A company of 10 usually isn't able to cope. Depends on the regulations though. Of course. emoticon_idea \n \n It's interesting how big business attacks socialism and welfare yet wholehardly embraces it.",

I agree, and I also don&#8217;t think they last forever, as explained in the other thread you are responding to.\n \n Great post and great points Duo. \n \n PS, you are right about fascism. My point was that we end up with just a few companies. We both agree that is bad.",
