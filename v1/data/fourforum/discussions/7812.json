   "Sorry Easyrider, I spent a lot of time composing this and I don't feel like wasting more running through all of the posts for the last week or two to find where it was. So I'll start a new thread (seems like an appropriate topic for one anyway).\n \n \n \nDamEtel: Let's recap. Your Christian sources are biased, and worse for you, we know early Christians fabricated stories left and right about Jesus, as well as His disciples: that casts doubt on their testimony. The gospel accounts of Jesus' crucifixion contradict each other in several places: again, casting doubt on their validity. All of the claimants you presented wrote way after the fact, and did not witness the events they are relaying: it's all mere hearsay. That does not count as valid evidence. \n\n \n \nEasyRider: ... I therefore ask that present your BEST ONE (alleged) CRUCIFIXION contradiction. JUST ONE. 1. ONE. YOUR BEST ONE. I'm not interested in answering a dozen or so of these follies, so PICK YOUR BEST ONE, and we'll see how that brainchild of yours holds up. \n \n You're on. Clock's ticking. It may be tomorrow before I am back on line.\n\n \n There are so many! I'll just pick the latest one I mentioned in that thread (whichever one it was).\n \n \n Jesus was crucified on different days according to different gospels.\n \n \n First, because the way the Jews considered their day to start differs from ours, the way Passover worked for Jews should be stated.\n \n 1) The Day of Preparation for the Passover is the day when the sacrificial lamb was killed and then prepared: but it was not eaten that same day (for Jews, a new day starts at nightfall, not at sunrise or even at midnight).\n \n 2) The next day (that is, what we would consider the same day, but at night) was Passover, and the lamb was then eaten: this was the Passover Feast.\n \n \n \n \n 1) The synoptic gospels\n In the synoptic gospels, Jesus is crucified on the day of Passover - the day the Passover Feast was eaten - or, equivalently, the day after the Day of Preparation for the Passover. \n \n \n Day of Preparation for the Passover\n On the day that the Passover lamb is to be sacrificed, Jesus tells some of his disciples to go make the preparations for the Passover.\n \n \nOn the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, \"Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?\"\n \n So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, \"Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\n \n The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.\n (Mark 14:12-16) \n \n\n \n \nOn the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, \"Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?\"\n \n He replied, \"Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'\" So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.\n (Matthew 26:17-19)\n \n\n \n \nThen came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, \"Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.\"\n \n \"Where do you want us to prepare for it?\" they asked.\n \n He replied, \"As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, and say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there.\"\n \n They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.\n (Luke 22:7-13)\n \n\n \n \n The Passover Feast (Last Supper on Passover)\n The very next statements in the synoptic gospels begin the narratives of the next day: Passover. The Passover Feast that was prepared the previous day is eaten (this year's meal later came to also be called the Last Supper). Only the very first part of the narratives will be quoted here, since the main point is when the meal occurred (the next day according to the Jews).\n \n \nWhen the evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, \"I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me - one who is eating with me.\"\n (Mark 14:17-18)\n \n\n \n \nWhen the evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. And while they were eating, he said, \"I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.\"\n (Matthew 26:20-21)\n \n\n \n \nWhen the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. And he said to them, \"I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.\"\n (Luke 22:14-15)\n \n\n \n The morning after Jesus' betrayal and arrest (which is the same day according to Jews), He is handed over to Pilate.\n \n \nVery early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.\n (Mark 15:1)\n \n\n \n \nEarly in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death. They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.\n (Matthew 27:12)\n \n\n \n \nAt daybreak the council of elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. ... The whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate.\n (Luke 22:66, 23:1)\n \n\n \n It is this day (according to the Jews, the same day the Passover Feast was eaten) that Jesus is crucified. \n \n \n \n \n 2) The gospel of \"John\" \n In the Gospel of John, Jesus is not crucified on the day after the Day of Preparation for the Passover Feast, nor is the Last Supper eaten on Passover.\n \n \nIt was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus.\n (John 13:1-2)\n \n\n \n \"John\" is a bit ambiguous here. It could be that:\n \n a) The entire passage refers to the same day. After all, \"It was just before the Passover Feast\" and \"The evening meal was being served\". The same tense indicates that the same day is being referred to, such that the Last Supper was eaten at some time before the Passover Feast, like a day before.\n \n b) The first two sentences refer to the Day of Preparation for the Passover, while the last one refers to the Jewish next day: the Passover. But if Jesus shows the full extent of his love during the meal - when He washed their feet - then the first two sentences refer to the same day as the third.\n \n So thus far, it looks contradictory, but could be considered consistent. But \"John\" says more.\n \n \n \n The morning after Jesus' betrayal and arrest (which is the same day as the Last Supper was eaten, according to Jews), He is handed over to Pilate.\n \n \nThen the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.\n (John 18:28-29)\n \n\n \n \"John\" is much clearer here. \n \n The morning that Jesus was handed over to Pilate occurred before the Jews were to eat the Passover. But in the synoptic gospels, Jesus was handed over to Pilate the morning after the Jews had eaten the Passover. That's a contradiction.\n \n \"John\" confirms the contradiction again.\n \n \nWhen Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone pavement (which in Aramaic in Gabbatha). It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour.\n (John 19:13-14)\n \n\n \n Again, \"John\" tells us that the day Jesus was before Pilate - the same day (whether using ours or the Jewish concept of a day) - was the Day of Preparation of Passover (Week). \n \n In \"John's\" gospel, we are told that Jesus was crucified the day before the Passover Feast was to be eaten; whereas in the synoptic gospels, we are told that He was crucified the day the Passover Feast had already eaten. Both cannot be correct.",

   "Evidence for the Friday Crucifixion (Etel's supposed contradictions answered):\n \n http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/pasover.htm\n \n At what hour was Jesus crucified?\n \n Mark 15:25 and John 19:14-16\n 1. The third hour (Mark 15:25) - \"And it was the third hour when they crucified Him.\" \n 2.

   "Just in case anything is naive enough to believe that I am the only one who realizes that contradiction ...\n \n Bart D. Ehrman - Chair of Religous Studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill - has a video lecture series called \"The Historical Jesus\". Lecuture Four is entitled \"Fact and Fiction in the Gospels\", and in it, he spends some time discussing the fact that John's gospel contradicts the synoptic gospels concerning on what day Jesus was crucified. The course guidebook (essentially some notes in outline form) that accompanies the video lectures devotes too much to this Biblical discrepancy for me to type out, but I will present a couple of snippets.\n \n First, the \"puchline\" concerning the contradiction found in \"John\"'s gospel.\n \n \n3. As we have seen, we're told that the Jewish leaders who were his accusers refuse to enter Pilate's residence, because they do not want to become ritually defiled and so prevented from eating the Passover meal that evening (18:28). Eat the Passover meal? Hadn't they already done that the night before?\n \n 4. The problem is clarified at the end of Jesus' trial, when we're told exactly when he was condemned and led off to be executed: John 19:14 - \"And this was on the Day of Preparation for the Passover ...\"\n \n\n \n Then Dr. Erhman goes on to explain why \"John\" might have changed the day Jesus was (\"supposedly\") crucified on.\n \n \nG. It is probably impossible to reconcile this discrepancy between John and the Synoptic Gospel account. We can, however, explain why the discrepancy came about.\n \n 1. The Gospel of John is the only Gospel of the New Testament that explicitly identifies Jesus himself as \"the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world\" (John 1:29, 36). This is also the only Gospel in which Jesus is said to die on the afternoon of the day before the Passover, precisely when lambs were being slaughtered.\n \n 2. To most scholars, it appears that John has changed a historical fact to make a theological point: that Jesus really was the Lamb of God.\n \n 3. This is one kind of evidence to suggest that the Gospels contain some accounts that cannot be historically accurate, at least in all their details.\n \n",

Why? Because the king did not mean to be gone for a full 72 hours. The counting of days was inclusive in nature. The same day that the king told them to leave was the first day. The second day they stayed away, and then they returned the third day, as the king had intended. This is the exactly the same manner of counting used for the resurrection. It is inclusive in nature, with whatever portion of the first and last days being counted as full days.\n \n Just for good measure, this same story is told in 2 Chronicles-\n \n 2 Chr 10:5 And he said unto them, Come again unto me *after three days*.

Outside Israel, the holiday is celebrated for 8 days, with the first two days and last two days celebrated as full festivals. The remaining days are known as Chol HaMoed (festival weekdays).\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesach\n \n Passover is also known as \"The Feast of Unleavened Bread.\"\n \n http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/holidays/pesach.htm\n \n Pesach lasts for seven days (eight days outside of Israel). \n \n http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaya.htm\n \n As Yahweh designed it, the Passover is a memorial (moed, appointed time) and separate from the Feast of Unleavened Bread, but Judaism later combined the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread into one Feast and this has caused much of the problem among Feast keepers today.\n \n Note what the Encyclopaedia Judaica says, \"The feast of Passover consists of two parts: the Passover ceremony, and the feast of Unleavened Bread. Originally, both parts existed separately; but at the beginning of the [Babylonian] exile they were combined\" (vol. 13, p. 169).\n \n http://www.yrm.org/establishingpassover.htm\n \n Now obviously the Jews of Jesus' day had their own Passover traditions that they observed according to various beliefs about when Passover was to be celebrated, whether it was the 14th day or the next day (both of which are sundown to sundown). \n \n You haven't established or proven any contradiction!!",

Why? Because the king did not mean to be gone for a full 72 hours. The counting of days was inclusive in nature. The same day that the king told them to leave was the first day. The second day they stayed away, and then they returned the third day, as the king had intended. This is the exactly the same manner of counting used for the resurrection. It is inclusive in nature, with whatever portion of the first and last days being counted as full days.\n \n Just for good measure, this same story is told in 2 Chronicles-\n \n 2 Chr 10:5 And he said unto them, Come again unto me *after three days*. And the people departed.\n \n 2 Chr 10:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam *on the third day*, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me *on the third day*.\n \n Note the way this is worded compared to 1 Kings.

Of course, those words have nothing to do with Jesus, except for the fact that Matthew was trying to retrofit the concept of 3 days into Jesus. That does not resolve the contradiction between various accounts of the New Testament though, but merely shows the reason some choices of why the New Testament writers made some of their choices.",

Both can't be true. \n\n \n \nGod Fearing Ath: But that is not what the synoptics say, DamEtal.\n\n \n Sure it is. \n \n Perhaps you've never read them?!??!! Here, let me show you, using Luke.\n \n \nThen came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, \"Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.\"\n \n \"Where do you want us to prepare for it?\" they asked.\n \n He replied, \"As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, and say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there.\"\n \n They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.\n \n When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. And he said to them, \"I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.\"\n (Luke 22:7-15)\n \n\n \n See, the day that the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed, some disciples prepared the Passover. That evening, when the Passover Feast was eaten, Jesus and his disciples ate the Passover Feast, as Jesus himself explicitly states. \n \n After eating the Passover, they leave for the Mount of Olives, Jesus prays, Judas betrays Jesus, and Jesus is arrested: then, when morning finally comes, the Jewish leaders hand Jesus over to Pilate. That's many hours after the Passover Feast had been eaten.\n \n But in John, when the Jewish leaders hand Jesus over to Pilate, they won't enter his place because they do not want to be defiled, lest they be prevented from eating the Passover that coming evening. Here's that quote for you.\n \n \nThen the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.\n (John 18:28-29) \n\n \n According to the synoptics, the Jews had already eaten the Passover Feast, many hours previously: According the \"John\", the Passover Feast was still many hours in the future. It's a one-day contradiction.\n \n \"John\" and the synoptics cannot both be true. \n \n Further, we have a very logical explanation of why \"John\" would have changed his day for the crucifixion: for theological reasons - to make Jesus be the sacrificial \"Lamb of God\".\n \n Now, I can't help it if you find material in the synoptics that create additional layers of contradiction: that's not my problem, but yours.",
