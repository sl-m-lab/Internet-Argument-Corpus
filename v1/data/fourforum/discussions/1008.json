   "Well known evolutionary pin-up boy, Richard Dawkins believes that religion is just a virus of the mind.\n \n \"With so many mindbytes to be downloaded, so many mental codons to be replicated, it is no wonder that child brains are gullible, open to almost any suggestion, vulnerable to subversion, easy prey to Moonies, Scientologists and nuns. Like immune-deficient patients, children are wide open to mental infections that adults might brush off without effort.\"\n http://www.geocities.com/closetatheist/virusesofthemind.htm\n \n \"Your joys and your sorrows, your memories and ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behaviour of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules\" - Francis Crick (quoted in Carroll, V, & Shiflett, D \"Christianity on Trial\", p83).\n \n \"I have already alluded to the programmed-in gullibility of a child, so useful for learning language and traditional wisdom, and so easily subverted by nuns, Moonies and their ilk. More generally, we all exchange information with one another. We don't exactly plug floppy disks into slots in one another's skulls, but we exchange sentences, both through our ears and through our eyes. We notice each other's styles of moving and dressing and are influenced. We take in advertising jingles, and are presumably persuaded by them, otherwise hard-headed businessmen would not spend so much money polluting their air with them.\" (http://www.geocities.com/closetatheist/virusesofthemind.htm)\n \n Beliefs that you might hold dear are worthless to people such as these, who don't understand.

Then again, I've never fitted into any category of anything my whole life.**\n \n I don't know about getting to heaven, except that God will judge. That the Orthodox Church proclaims it is THE WAY.\n \n \n * for the sake of labels, my mum and grand-ma would write 'Presbyterian' on a census form, but neither went to church at all.\n \n \n **Religiously conservative, but politcally radical. This is why I chose \"Montalban\" it is the name of a legendary castle of 'misfits' from Bulfinch's Mythology (Thomas Bulfinch wrote a compilation of Europena myths)",

From Buddhists, Jews, to Agnostics, Confucianists. Beleifs are so unreliable because you never really know your right. We are all pretty much clueless when it comes to the meaning of life and religion because its all so vauge but we all have our speculations. Its so hard to tell which religion is right.\n (Of course you might say that because your a Chrisitan you feel Jesus love, but just the same a Hindhu may feel the spirit Gods love and see it as proof)\n The truth is we will probably never know any of it. Its all so complex.\n But there is one thing thats very simple. Good and Evil. Call it energy, feelings, or impulses... When you cause pain to someone you know its wrong. You can tell the difference. And using that difference you can produce good and or bad works. \n In conclusion with religion you never really know.

To your logical, analytical mind this mind seem illogical. \n\n \n i agree, IMO imagining a being outside the rules of \"logic\" does seem illogical... however...\n \n \n \nTo an everyday person, unconditional love seems illogical.\n\n \n nope, unconditional love does not seem illogical to me. Humans are a crazy bunch... sometimes we hold unwarranted or illogical beliefs. if someone has unconditional love for someone else, i probably would assert their love is somewhat unfounded, but i wouldn't claim i didn't understand it. \n \n \nSomeone giving their life for someone else just because they love them seems illogical.\n\n \n again, i can understand this too. Sacrificing yourself for the benefit of the group... or maybe just one person whom you think deserves to live more than you. i can't see myself doing this... but it doesn't mean i see it as illogical.\n \n \nIf someone was sick for years and then someone prayed for them and the were miraculously healed, that is outside the rules of logic.\n\n \n it would be if there was a direct correlation between praying and healing.

   "Not all children do. I reacted against my step-father, and my father. But I am more than just one giant (re-)action.\n\n \n Well, lets start at the beginning then. Did you learn anything unconsciously from your parents? For example, I'm guessing communication is pretty important to you. Do you recall reacting against learning English from your parents? Of course not. How about the belief in Santa or the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy? Eventually you learned they didn't exist but assuming your parents attempted to make you believe in them, I'm sure there was a time when you did. You can react against your parents teachings to some extent but as a child you will use them as a model of how you are supposed to be because they are all you really know at the time. Religious beliefs can be easily passed from parent to child because of this. I would debate that if you were born to a Chinese couple who believed in Buddhism you wouldn't believe in the Christian God right now.\n \n \nI would teach the correct religion.\n\n \n Lets assume for a moment that Buddhism is the correct religion. Would you teach that? I'm betting your too happy with your beliefs right now to even consider another religion is correct. So with your vision so blinded, how can you be sure you have given enough thought to what is the correct religion?\n \n \nYou are asking me to not love my neighbour, and also, to second-guess what it is that they are teaching. I don't know what they are teaching them. You could extend this illogic and proclaim that I find out what my whole street is doing. But then I'd not be looking after my own family.\n\n \n I'm asking you to love your neighbor more than ever before! If you know they are sending their kid to hell then you need to save them! You have to for the sake of love! If you love them and God and care for their child then how can you sit back and do nothing? Shouldn't you do whatever you can to save that child?\n \n \nJesus didn't spend His whole time preaching. There were times when He withdrew from the masses to pray. Our ultimate goal is to be close to God, not peering into my neighbour's window.\n\n \n Then he wasn't perfect after all. He couldn't save those who needed him the most. How sad :(\n \n \nHow would I know if my neighbour is doing this? What if he recants at the time of his death? Alternatively, he could be teaching his children good Orthodoxy, but recant at the time of his death, and thus be condemned. I would in effect, have to be in my neighbour's skin 24/7.\n\n \n So you're willing to let another innocent soul be condemned to hell because it is convenient for you to do so? Again I ask, how can you live with yourself?\n \n \nGod will judge them as He will me. But, I believe Romans 2 covers what my neighbours are up to.\n\n \n Will God judge them on what they learned as kids and what they have brainwashed their child to believe in? Why would God base the eternal souls final destination based on what family the soul was born to and what religion it's mind was brainwashed with?\n \n Just give an estimate here. If Christianity (all of Christianity) is correct, then lets say that 100% of all Christians go to heaven. 0% of other religions make it to heaven. All you have to do is be a Christian by the time you die to go to heaven in this scenario. So what percentage of children born to Christians go to heaven? What percentage of Buddhists? What percentage of Muslims? I think you will see my point here. Getting into heaven is based primarily on what family and culture you were born to IMO. You might have a 5% chance if not born to a Christian family/culture and a 95% chance if born to a Christian family/culture. So how can God base whether you get to heaven on what you believed on Earth? If he was a fair God I think he would base it on whether you were a good person or not. Then it is fair for everyone. How could a perfect God have missed this obvious point? Don't you feel sorry for the Chinese who are going to hell just because people thousands of years ago decided Buddhism was the right religion?",

So you're just arguing to pass the time, or what?\n\n \n I'm uncertain, so I just make the assumption that what we physically observe is what there actually is....

Darwinism) intrinsically more appealing than say 'spontaneous generation'?\n\n \n just because ideas are uncertain, doesn't mean they are arbitrary. Science makes the simplest assumptions to explain the natural world in observable terms. God is nor observable, so is not included in scientific explanations.\n \n \nSo in other words, because you are uncertain you can't understand why someone would be certain, or you dislike people who are certain, or what?\n\n \n again, I'm not anti religious. I have problems when religious people try to point out that science is flawed because they don't address issues that their religion addresses. That's fine if you want to pretend you have absolute knowledge about something... but you don't. Want to know why? Because I could explain a made up world that would have the exact same end product as the one we're in now... and you couldn't tell the difference. So you wouldn't know which one was which... thus giving the possibility of no God. Are you going to admit at least that? That to the best of your knowledge there is a God, but you could be mistaken about that?\n \n \nCertainly on another post you got a bit angry when I admitted I'd already made up my mind about God. Rather irrational.\n\n \n Go nuts believing there is a god. But when you try to present evidence accept in your religion as scientific, you are in error. And the fact that you think you already have all the answers, and no matter what we say we can't convince you of anything new... that gets on my nerves. If you actually presented valid evidence you could convince me (and probably a lot of people) that evolution did not occur.... But that doesn't work the same the other way. \n \n \nIt's best to start with the truth, then modify your behaviour to suit the truth as you understand it, not come up with a way of living, and then get the belief system that justifies that.\n\n \n possibly the most unscientific thing you've said so fat (which is fine, just as long as you don't try to get scientists to start with truth, and then modify their behavior). Science does not assume a prior knowledge about anything. Anything they come up with is the result of tying together numerous observations and other theories. And for all this time it's all tentative. Just because they believe it now, doesn't mean it has to be believed tomorrow, or 100 years from now. Science does not have the luxury of rejecting evidence simply because it conflicts with what they've already decided on. \n \n [/quote]So, what is at the core of your beliefs?[/quote]\n \n 1) What we observe is real, and 2) Fundamental physical laws have not changed. Even the second isn't really an a prior assumptions since everything we've observed suggests that fundamental physical laws do not change. \n \n As for god, I don't know. I classify myself as agnostic. Certainly some religious ideas of God are probably wrong because they conflict with physical evidence (As well as themselves). \n \n However to say there was no god, or \"higher being\" would be making an assertion with no supporting evidence. IMO, there is no evidence that suggests the existence of god",

   "Well, lets start at the beginning then. Did you learn anything unconsciously from your parents? For example, I'm guessing communication is pretty important to you. Do you recall reacting against learning English from your parents? Of course not. How about the belief in Santa or the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy? Eventually you learned they didn't exist but assuming your parents attempted to make you believe in them, I'm sure there was a time when you did. You can react against your parents teachings to some extent but as a child you will use them as a model of how you are supposed to be because they are all you really know at the time. Religious beliefs can be easily passed from parent to child because of this. I would debate that if you were born to a Chinese couple who believed in Buddhism you wouldn't believe in the Christian God right now.\n\n \n Of course I learnt things from my parents. Actually yes I do recall reacting against English. Conas a ta tu inniu? Ta me go maith!*\n \n You said it yourself. I was taught about Santa et al and no longer believe in him. You've just argued against yourself.\n \n As for China they are highly restrictive against any preaching.\n \n \nLets assume for a moment that Buddhism is the correct religion. Would you teach that? I'm betting your too happy with your beliefs right now to even consider another religion is correct. So with your vision so blinded, how can you be sure you have given enough thought to what is the correct religion?\n\n \n I already told you that I'd teach the correct religion. Why would I say 'my religion is correct' but then also consider another religion is correct? You make no sense. You believe what you believe to be correct... unless your belief is to have no belief. Is your vision so blinded that I might be right? Have you ever considered Orthodoxy? I bet you've barely heard of it.\n \n \nI'm asking you to love your neighbor more than ever before! If you know they are sending their kid to hell then you need to save them! You have to for the sake of love! If you love them and God and care for their child then how can you sit back and do nothing? Shouldn't you do whatever you can to save that child?\n\n \n No your not. I don't know that they are sending their kids to hell at all! The parents don't condemn people to hell, as far as I'm aware. No Orthodox teaches this at all. You are making assumptions based on some smug idea that's based on what you think I should do as a Christian, that is so separate from reality.\n \n Let's see if you're a hypocrite. Do you love your neighbour? What if they're teaching their children about religion? Shouldn't you go an tell them that they're brainwashing their kids? Are you doing this? - I'm judging you by your own standards here, but I guess you don't.\n \n \nThen he wasn't perfect after all. He couldn't save those who needed him the most. How sad\n\n \n He offered to save every man; even snide people such as yourself. It's lucky that it's Jesus offering you this gift, because he has more patience with you. You're assuming that being physically healed is the same as being spiritually healed! How strange. He could have given them all new cars too, and a plasma screen TV, and made their lives a lot more comfortable, but they wouldn't have been saved.\n \n \nSo you're willing to let another innocent soul be condemned to hell because it is convenient for you to do so? Again I ask, how can you live with yourself?\n\n \n Err... no. If they were innocent they wouldn't go to hell now would they! And, I'm not condemning people to hell. I do wish that before you make such smug statements that you actually do a bit of research on what Orthodox believe, and stop being a hypocrite, (see above)\n \n \nWill God judge them on what they learned as kids and what they have brainwashed their child to believe in? Why would God base the eternal souls final destination based on what family the soul was born to and what religion it's mind was brainwashed with?\n\n \n I said it quite clearly, God will judge them. Romans 2 gives us an insight, but you are trying to second-guess God.\n \n \nJust give an estimate here. If Christianity (all of Christianity) is correct, then lets say that 100% of all Christians go to heaven. 0% of other religions make it to heaven. All you have to do is be a Christian by the time you die to go to heaven in this scenario. So what percentage of children born to Christians go to heaven? What percentage of Buddhists? What percentage of Muslims? I think you will see my point here. Getting into heaven is based primarily on what family and culture you were born to IMO. You might have a 5% chance if not born to a Christian family/culture and a 95% chance if born to a Christian family/culture. So how can God base whether you get to heaven on what you believed on Earth? If he was a fair God I think he would base it on whether you were a good person or not. Then it is fair for everyone. How could a perfect God have missed this obvious point? Don't you feel sorry for the Chinese who are going to hell just because people thousands of years ago decided Buddhism was the right religion?\n\n \n I don't see that you are making a 'point' you are making a facile argument based on un-natural constructs. You state you have an opinion about getting into heaven. Based on what? A guess? You read it on the back of a pack of cornflakes?\n \n I'm not sure if you saw it, so I'll write it again.... Christianity is THE WAY. Not everyone who claims to be Christian follows THE WAY - for it is a narrow path and people are arrogant and proud. Some people who don't believe in God, follow THE WAY (see Romans 2) and will be judged accordingly.\n \n \"If he was a fair God...\" Are you saying he isn't? Based on what?\n \n If you believe that he is a fair God, then your argument falls down, because you are trying to work out a situation where he'd be unfair.\n \n *I am quite angered that I wasn't taught a Gaelic language",

   "Originally Posted by montalban\n If you are uncertain, then why believe in science, and not religion, and be uncertain in your faith in God, or have a number of gods? Obviously you just flipped a coin, or is it because you can't stand the idea of a God out there beyond what you think you can experience? It's a rather odd way of living... arguing about something that in the long run you're not even certain is true. Arguing against something that for all intents and purposes might be true. So you're just arguing to pass the time, or what?\n \n Theomorphic: I?m uncertain, so I just make the assumption that what we physically observe is what there actually is?. And I?ll continue doing that until some observation occurs that can?t be explained by a physical mechanism.\n \n \n So, you still haven't answered why you don't believe in any god. You've already started with the axiom that there is no God, and worked from there.\n \n Originally Posted by montalban\n If there is no certainty, then why is scientific materialism (i.e.. Darwinism) intrinsically more appealing than say 'spontaneous generation'?\n \n Theomorphic: just because ideas are uncertain, doesn?t mean they are arbitrary. Science makes the simplest assumptions to explain the natural world in observable terms. God is nor observable, so is not included in scientific explanations.\n \n \n If an idea is uncertain, then believing in it MUST BE arbitrary, because what other basis do you have for believing in it? You can't say evidence, because then it's not uncertain now is it?\n \n God is observable. I keep telling you that there's witness statements to the effect. I can understand that science doesn't accept it, but we've already agreed with just how limiting a belief system science is. So you're saying you'd prefer to have certainty in a belief system that can't possibly determine anything other than what it perceives it can observe, rather than in God.\n \n Originally Posted by montalban\n So in other words, because you are uncertain you can't understand why someone would be certain, or you dislike people who are certain, or what?\n \n Theomorphic: again, I?m not anti religious. I have problems when religious people try to point out that science is flawed because they don?t address issues that their religion addresses. That?s fine if you want to pretend you have absolute knowledge about something? but you don?t. Want to know why? Because I could explain a made up world that would have the exact same end product as the one we?re in now? and you couldn?t tell the difference. So you wouldn?t know which one was which? thus giving the possibility of no God. Are you going to admit at least that? That to the best of your knowledge there is a God, but you could be mistaken about that?\n \n Ah, but you accept that science is flawed. So the real issue here is you don't like religious people pointing this out. You accept that there are possibilities of right and wrong in scientific theory, but you reject in toto religion!\n \n I am not mistaken in that there is a God. I will not deny Him. In the end we have a limited language\n \n Originally Posted by montalban\n Certainly on another post you got a bit angry when I admitted I'd already made up my mind about God. Rather irrational.\n \n Theomorphic: Go nuts believing there is a god. But when you try to present evidence accept in your religion as scientific, you are in error. And the fact that you think you already have all the answers, and no matter what we say we can?t convince you of anything new? that gets on my nerves. If you actually presented valid evidence you could convince me (and probably a lot of people) that evolution did not occur?. But that doesn?t work the same the other way.\n \n Er, not I'm trying to show that it is evidence. And I'm trying to get non-believers not to dismiss it as evidence. And, at the same time you guys believe that your evidence is more valid than mine... when you have beliefs based on a plethora of conflicting schools of thought.\n \n Originally Posted by montalban\n It's best to start with the truth, then modify your behaviour to suit the truth as you understand it, not come up with a way of living, and then get the belief system that justifies that.\n \n Theomorphic: possibly the most unscientific thing you?ve said so fat (which is fine, just as long as you don?t try to get scientists to start with truth, and then modify their behaviour). Science does not assume a prior knowledge about anything. Anything they come up with is the result of tying together numerous observations and other theories. And for all this time it?s all tentative. Just because they believe it now, doesn?t mean it has to be believed tomorrow, or 100 years from now. Science does not have the luxury of rejecting evidence simply because it conflicts with what they?ve already decided on. \n \n Scientists aren't the ubermensch you believe that they are. They are flawed and failing individuals just like you and I. I never put them on the pedestal that you have - because I accept they make mistakes. You will too, but not at this point in time when you're again raised them above the subjective world to a place of higher existence.\n BUT\n You will contradict yourself a little later, but I'll spare you the wait. Here you say \"And for all this time it?s all tentative\" but later you'll state your core beliefs with such certainty.\n \n Montalban:So, what is at the core of your beliefs?\n Theomorphic: 1) What we observe is real, and 2) Fundamental physical laws have not changed. Even the second isn?t really an a prior assumptions since everything we?ve observed suggests that fundamental physical laws do not change. \n As for god, I don?t know. I classify myself as agnostic. Certainly some religious ideas of God are probably wrong because they conflict with physical evidence (As well as themselves). \n However to say there was no god, or ?higher being? would be making an assertion with no supporting evidence. IMO, there is no evidence that suggests the existence of god\n \n How do you know?\n \n You are trying again to have the best of both worlds...\n \n Religion is wholly subjective / science is \" for all this time it?s all tentative\" yet still more valid than religion? If that's not a priori reasoning I don't know what is!\n \n You live according to the zeit geist of scientific materialism. All your beliefs are based on this assumed knowledge.",

If you don't know where or what Shenzhen is then you shouldn't be making remarks about China at all. If you do then I'd like to see what your thoughts are on Shenzhen and whether they are as unrestrictive as you believe they are. As a whole China is also changing as more and more of the country moves towards capitalism and the free market. Plus you can easily practice religion in China. It isn't done publicly nearly as much as it is in the US and the people there just don't but a whole lot of emphasis on religion either. It also isn't uncommon there for people to believe in multiple religions and think that more than one are right. Talk about religious freedom :)\n \n \nIn other words, your belief is that there is no belief.

It leads to children being condemned to hell if taught the wrong thing and the children believe in their parents.\n \n What have I asked you to believe in? All I ask is that you please save the children as they cannot defend themselves from their parents brainwashing. Be part of the solution!\n \n \nErr... you can't say this. You must either say that none of them are right or wrong, or you can't show that any of them are right or wrong. You can't just say that because you can't show it, it doesn't exist. If you don't believe any of them are right or wrong - how do you know?\n\n \n lol, I just did say this :) What is right and wrong anyways? Right and wrong are opinion in the case of religion. Your opinion is that you are right. I bet you anything that I can find someone who disagrees with you completely but has just as strong of a belief that they are right. You are both basing your right and wrong on opinions, beliefs, feelings, and faith. No one can assess who is logically right or wrong. I could believe that my dog is God and you couldn't prove me wrong as it would be an opinion that I am basing it on. You cannot disprove or prove such a thing. So yes, I can say that the three religions I listed off are all equally right. A Chinese person may even find it common to believe in all of them at once and no one will question why they do that. Perhaps they are on to something?\n \n \nReally? So, the message is untrue because it doesn't fit in with your timetable of how it should have been spread? Again, what's with this children going to hell obsession? Where did Jesus cast the children in hell... you've got to stop making such statements unless you can back it up. How were they condemned if you say that they weren't taught? Before you were saying that they could be condemned if they were taught. Now you're saying that children should be taught at a young age? I do wish you'd make up your mind on this!\n\n \n Back when I did consider myself a Christian I felt bad for the children of China who learned all the wrong religions. I thought it was unfair for God to let their afterlife fates be determined by where in the world they were born. That is where my obsession with children going to hell comes from. Just as I've been asking you 'how do you live with yourself' when it comes to doing nothing about this problem, I used to ask myself this.\n \n You said that your religion is correct. If your religion is correct, then those who believe in different ones are wrong. They are going to hell. Jesus has nothing to do with this other than he didn't do a very good job of teaching the entire world which religion was the correct one. He made it very lopsided. This has in turn made it less possible for those living in select locations to make it heaven and easier for others to make it to heaven. What is really unfair about this is how easily children in these 'bad' areas are influenced by their culture and families. The children may have all the best intentions but they will go to hell because they were taught wrong in the first place. Don't you see any thing wrong with this? Lets say that you tried to live your life for God because you learned from your experiences that it was right. Don't you think Allah should accept that you did your best and let you have your 100 virgins in your afterlife if he were the real God? Shouldn't the Christian God allow a Muslim who has lived his life for Allah and been a good person with good intentions into heaven? I sure think he should if he is a sensible God.\n \n \nReally? Name one!\n\n \n Gandhi.\n \n \nAre you asking me or telling me? Guilty of what?\n\n \n You say innocents cannot go to hell. I asked if being any religion other than Christian made you guilty regardless of anything else they have done in their life.\n \n \nWho? The people who are guilty of 'something'? Are you saying that someone who commits murder can no longer believe in God? Is there no hope for any sinner? Tell me, what sin would I have to have committed before I can't accept God... is there a limit?\n\n \n The sad thing is that there is more of a hope for a sinner than an innocent who just learned the wrong religion.\n \n \nYou have a closed mind too! You've already excluded any and all religions from being correct/incorrect, therefore irrelevant.\n\n \n I didn't say they were correct or incorrect. I said they cannot be proven to be either. Basing my ideas on how flawed humans are I can say that even if God explained himself to each of us none of us would still have a good understanding of him. I just assume that humanity screwed up somewhere along the line and either made up God because it was in their nature to do so or Jesus was real and humanity just screwed up the Bible making it untrustworthy. I have enough evidence to be convinced that the Bible is flawed therefore Christianity is in question in my mind. I still believe that the majority of the ideas are correct but parts are incorrect. I believe God doesn't base his requirements to get into heaven on flawed techniques such as what religion you believe in. I believe God bases his requirements on logic and he is a real thinking person so to speak. I think if you had to write down all the ideas surrounding his considerations for the afterlife you would have a book that would consume most of the worlds resources to print just one copy. But this is just my opinion based on feelings, faith, and brainwashing :)\n \n \nI think your statement needs a little re-think. You're now asking me if a Muslim or a Christian can grow up believing in God! Of course they can.\n\n \n I agree they can. I'm not asking that though. I'm asking who has the better CHANCE of making it to heaven, the one with a strong Christian influence or the one with a strong Muslim influence. Is this so hard to answer?\n \n \nAgain the convoluted... God is not about being fair? Says you!\n\n \n Well, the Christian idea of God is not about being fair. Fair would be similar to my image of what God is. But I'm sure you already forgot what that is.\n \n \nDefine 'good'!\n\n \n Opposite of bad. A positive thing to have on this planet. Something the creator would welcome to return to this planet. Now you have to define the creator and of course that comes down to opinion. So the definition of good is based on opinion. However I think you could find a good majority of the people on the planet can distinguish between good and bad and arrive at the same conclusions. I'm with the majority on what the definition of good is.\n \n \nNot what I said at all. I said my primary focus must be me. If you are really concerned, you'd be doing all the things you suggest that I should... checking out the neighbours, cajoling them etc. because they might be teaching their children to be 'close minded' which of course means that they don't believe what you believe.\n\n \n Ah you just did it again. Some Christian you are.\n \n I'm already doing all the things I suggested for you only in the context of my beliefs. If I had your beliefs I would find it hard to stand by and watch parents teach their children the things that could lead them to hell. Lucky for me that I believe Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, and every other belief a person could have doesn't really affect their final judgment. I believe God is logical and doesn't care so much about who believes in him and who doesn't. He cares that you lived a good life and were a good person who was religious in some fashion. This would of course be the only logical way God could be if you want him to be a fair God when it comes to final judgments :)",

   "What kind of proof do you wish to have? Physical proof? Check the north pole if you wish. Check your roof top on Christmas night. Keep a camera by your Christmas tree and see if any presents arrive. Seriously man, think before you ask a stupid question like this one again.\n\n \n Err. you are the one in post 49 who said \"Unlike Santa, there is no proof that God doesn't exist. That is part of what makes it easy for parents to convince their child that he exists and it sticks. With Santa the kids will eventually learn that he doesn't exist.\"\n \n I ask you then where is the proof... or you've done is shown me where he isn't.\n \n I don't believe in Santa, but it's you who made the statement that you don't believe in Santa because there's no proof. So, prove to me that Santa doesn't exist! And it was you who said that people follow what they are taught by their parents, so either a) you weren't taught Santa by your folk, b) you still believe in Santa or c) you have been given proof of his non-existence.\n \n \n\n There is no proven belief and there is no way to know which is right. The best you can do is live the best life possible and hope that if there is a God that he created you in his image and mind set. For me that would be one of logic.\n\n \n Herein is where you keep saying you believe in something because of no proof. Before you said you don't believe in Santa because of no proof. So, with no proof you can believe or not believe in anything you want.\n \n \nI've already shown how. It isn't an orthodox teaching. It is a religious teaching. It leads to children being condemned to hell if taught the wrong thing and the children believe in their parents.\n\n \n If it's not Orthodox teaching then there's no point brining it up in this case, because I'm not going to agree with it.\n \n \nWhat have I asked you to believe in? All I ask is that you please save the children as they cannot defend themselves from their parents brainwashing. Be part of the solution!\n\n \n Here you are assuming that I SHOULD BELIEVE that they are going to hell.\n \n \nlol, I just did say this What is right and wrong anyways?

I have told you about who goes to hell. Stop with the statements that I must believe that other people are going to hell. You can either ask me what I believe in, or tell me what I believe in is rubbish, but you can't keep telling me what I believe in. You're on this issue of children going to hell like a dog with a bone, you just won't let it go.\n \n I asked you to tell me one innocent who is in hell...\n \nGandhi.\n\n \n So, you know for a fact that Gandhi is in hell! Prove it!\n \n \nYou say innocents cannot go to hell.

I'm asking who has the better CHANCE of making it to heaven, the one with a strong Christian influence or the one with a strong Muslim influence. Is this so hard to answer?\n\n \n It is if you don't ask it until now! I'll tell you again. I follow the Way as taught by Christ. I put my faith in that.\n \n \nWell, the Christian idea of God is not about being fair. Fair would be similar to my image of what God is.

   "Err. you are the one in post 49 who said \"Unlike Santa, there is no proof that God doesn't exist.

With Santa the kids will eventually learn that he doesn't exist.\"\n \n I ask you then where is the proof... or you've done is shown me where he isn't.\n \n I don't believe in Santa, but it's you who made the statement that you don't believe in Santa because there's no proof. So, prove to me that Santa doesn't exist! And it was you who said that people follow what they are taught by their parents, so either a) you weren't taught Santa by your folk, b) you still believe in Santa or c) you have been given proof of his non-existence.\n\n \n Unless we are talking about a different Santa... Santa has a workshop at the North Pole. Santa rides in a sleight flown around by reindeer and land on roofs. Santa comes to your house on Christmas Eve and drops off presents. Since these things have to physically happen for the myth of Santa to be real, you can disprove them. Therefore the Santa theory is easily proven to be incorrect.\n \n Now lets say that God had to physically have a workshop at the North Pole to be real. By this time we would already know that he doesn't exist because there is no workshop at the North Pole. However, he doesn't physically exist anywhere so there is nothing to prove or disprove physically.\n \n \nHerein is where you keep saying you believe in something because of no proof. Before you said you don't believe in Santa because of no proof. So, with no proof you can believe or not believe in anything you want.\n\n \n I believe in logical procedure. Logic can dictate that certain things are more likely than other things and therefore have the highest probability of being true. This is useful to use in the case where proof is lacking or nonexistant.\n \n \nIf it's not Orthodox teaching then there's no point brining it up in this case, because I'm not going to agree with it.\n\n \n It pertains to the teaching of religion. If Orthodox don't realize that people teach religion then I guess you are right. In any other case you are wrong.\n \n \nHere you are assuming that I SHOULD BELIEVE that they are going to hell.\n\n \n You already said your religion was right....so there you have it.\n \n \nThe difference would be that they'd be wrong.\n\n \n As would you be in their eyes. There would be no right or wrong in the whole debate unless one of you could channel your God and bring him to Earth to show your point. At the end of the argument there would be no agreement on right or wrong. I'm sure you agree with this. If not then you admit that you are willing to change your idea on what is right and wrong and boy oh boy, that would mean you have an open mind :O\n \n \nYou felt bad? Did you go and convert them, tell them where they went wrong? Why do you think that I should, if you didn't?\n\n \n I asked myself a question first. Do I really believe that God exists? Do I really understand him all that well? I found my answers and of course I am no longer working with the same ideas that you are. For you though, you already know what is right and wrong but you are too lazy to do what your religion and conscious have to support which would be saving children from learning the wrong religion and risking eternal damnation.\n \n \nI wish now, and I've asked you before, to stop telling me what I must believe in as part of my Christian faith. I have told you about who goes to hell. Stop with the statements that I must believe that other people are going to hell. You can either ask me what I believe in, or tell me what I believe in is rubbish, but you can't keep telling me what I believe in. You're on this issue of children going to hell like a dog with a bone, you just won't let it go.\n\n \n That's because you should be the one who believes in it most and I find it to be most curious that with all your religious beliefs that you will not help the children of this world. How committed are you really to God? Do you really believe he exists so much that you are willing to spread his word? Are you willing to go above and beyond the call of duty and devote your life to saving other souls? That truly would impress God! Plus it would clear your conscious of the fact that your doing nothing to help the children that are being taught the wrong religion!\n \n \nI asked you to tell me one innocent who is in hell...\n \n So, you know for a fact that Gandhi is in hell! Prove it!\n\n \n Like I said before, you already said your religion was the right one....so there it is.\n \n \nGuilty of what?\n\n \n You say innocents cannot go to hell. I asked if being any religion other than Christian made you guilty regardless of anything else they have done in their life.\n \n \nYou keep saying this. Hello? Is anyone there. Fair enough, you believe it. I can live with that. So long as you don't keep asking me if I believe it's fair... your system of beliefs.\n\n \n Actually you indicated that you believe it. I could again fall back on the fact that you said your religion is right....so there it is.\n \n \nSO, you base your ideas on a lack of proof of correctness or incorrectness, just on a feeling. Where is the Bible screwed up? You make so many sweeping statements. What flawed techniques do I believe in?\n\n \n My base ideas are based on the Bible being inaccurate in parts which of course it is. You can see my failed biblical prophecies thread if you wish and get a portion of where it is wrong.\n \n The flawed technique is of course the belief that God judges people based on whether they believe in him or not. The technique is unfair based on the logic of this world and I don't believe God would be unfair.\n \n \nIt is if you don't ask it until now! I'll tell you again. I follow the Way as taught by Christ. I put my faith in that.\n\n \n This backs up the idea that the technique is unfair.\n \n \nYou're getting weird now. You don't know whether you believe God is fair or not, you think a certain set of rules would be fair, but you're not sure if God follows them, then you turn around and say you live a certain way based on your feelings and you hope God will take this into consideration. Have I left anything out?\n\n \n You are sure that you know God but I know that you don't since you follow Christianity. Does that make you anymore wrong than you believe that I am?\n \n \nThat is not a definition of what it is, you're defining it by what it isn't. If I asked you what is 'bad' you'd probably say 'not good'. The \n\n \n If you want a simple definition just go to a dictionary. I gave the definition on a much larger scale. Sorry if that offends you.\n \n \nSo, you don't think I'm a good Christian. Since you're not even sure by what standard to judge, and you're not even sure about being certain about anything, I find your statement rather odd.\n\n \n Christian is an easy standard to judge. What do you think I would be unsure of the standards?\n \n \nSo now God's logical. But unfair? A moment ago you had condemned the world's children to hell, and Gandhi as well!\n\n \n Your Christian God is unfair and condemns the world's children to hell as well as Gandhi just for learning the wrong religion. This is a belief that you HAVE to believe it :) So to test how strong your beliefs are I ask that you help save the children from a horrible fate and yet you are unwilling to lift a finger other than to argue that you shouldn't have to help anyone. Some Christian you are!\n \n \nGet back to me when you've come up with a consistent set of beliefs.\n\n \n My beliefs are never going to be consistent. They are always changing based on new information. I'm not going to close my mind as easily as you have closed yours.\n \n \nAlso, your basis for saying China is fairer is based on one person. Good one! emoticon_xgood\n\n \n It is based mostly on that one person but also based on experiences with the other 15 Chinese students I was in class with for 2 semesters in Chinese history classes. The teacher shared a lot of her experiences in China and explained a lot about how things are changing. The videos we watched and research I did afterwards was quite informative as well.\n \n Since you didn't answer any of my China questions I'll assume your knowledge is severely lacking in this area but I'll let you off the hook for pretending to know something about them since I'm just a nice guy :)",

I bet that is a freaky idea to you :)\n \n \nOh, on China cracking down on religion...\n http://www.roea.org/9611/ho00014.html (on Christianity)\n http://www.tibet.ca/wtnarchive/2000/1/15_3.html (on Tibetan Buddhists)\n http://www.hankooki.com/times/200206/t2002062717264440110.htm (on Christianity)\n http://www.globalpolicy.org/wtc/liberties/2002/0322china.htm (on Islam)\n http://www.rickross.com/reference/fa_lun_gong/falun177.html (on Falun Gong)\n \n Hey, but you've got this friend!\n\n \n With Tibetan Buddhists you have a point although this situation is even improving but for the most part all religions are tolerated. Lets not forget Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong along with surrounding areas plus the increasingly opening Chinese government and markets. Can you believe China is actually becoming a socialist free market as stated by their leader! Just knowing this should help you understand how the culture is opening up. Also I think you should take a look at this recent history of Shenzhen. I think you will be fascinated by what has gone on there! 20 years ago they were a fishing town of 30,000 people and now it is an economic powerhouse of capitalism with 4.7 million people! I bet this isn't the China that you know :)\n \n Anyways, back on topic.\n \n http://www.tibet.ca/wtnarchive/1998/2/12_4.html\n \n \"There are some people who accuse China of religious persecution but the main reasons for their accusations against China are due to the fact they don't seem to have a good understanding or are ignorant of what is happening in China or the reality of China,\" delegation leader Ye Xiaowen said through an interpreter at a news conference in New York.\n \n I'm sure my friend would agree with this statement. As crazy as the Chinese policy is towards religion it really isn't defended all that much. People are sometimes hassled for a having a religious gathering but it isn't as you put it \"As for China they are highly restrictive against any preaching\"\n \n http://www.fas.org/news/china/2000/000202-prc1.htm\n \n \"The five religions allowed by the government are Buddhism, Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism and Taoism.\"\n \n There you go. Government allows religion :) But I'm sure you are going to deny that this is possible as your views of China are different than what actually happens there.\n \n \n*I play to my audience. And I'm very close to using expletives here.\n\n \n lol, what are you talking about? If you're upset about my China religious references, why don't you look up my viewpoint and see if you can find proof backing it up. You surely don't want to hear me backing it up and you are obviously upset that I have such information in the first place. I used to be of the same mindset as you when it came to religion in China until I learned more about it. They are not as free to practice religion in China as we are in the US, but they also really don't put a whole lot of emphasis on religion there either. They have religion but they see it as a way of enlightenment for the most part. Some see it the way you do but they are the minority. Still your original statement about China being against any preaching of religion is false and I hope you understand this better now.\n \n \n It has been fun debating with you on this topic. You are very adamant about your opinions in this debate and I think that adds a lot of flavor to any debate. Much better than your US borders debate :) I hope that you have some better understanding of both your opinions as well as those shown to you from another person's perspective. I know I've gained some insight on the inner workings of a devoted Orthodox mind in this debate and have a better understanding of my own opinions as well. Also I'm glad that China did come up in this debate and that I was able to express some of my knowledge about the country and eliminate some of the incorrect ideas a lot of Americans have about this country and their religious practices. They really are an interesting country and much more religiously free than many of us believe they are. I look forward to debating with you again :)\n \n Have a nice day!",

How would you describe your beliefs in this arena?\n\n \n I tend to believe in a God although I can't say that I base my image of God on the writings of the Bible. My beliefs of God is based on my belief that he is logical and fair. My view of God is that he did put us here for a reason more complex than what the Bible has listed out. If we were just here to love him, well that is a pretty weak thing for an all powerful being to try and achieve. He could have made people love him if he wished. I generally try to show this by asking people what they prefer cats or dogs. Dogs are XXXXXX but they love you no matter what. Cats are jerks and are very picky about who they love. If you're a dog lover then you understand why I think God would have preferred to create a race who loves him. If you're a cat lover you probably better relate to the God of the Bible not wanting his people just to love him without question. So being a dog lover has affected my view of God as well :) I think I draw my view of what God is based a lot on how I think. I get critisized for doing this because I don't base my idea of him on any real evidence other than my own beliefs. Still I would contend that at least I base my evidence on my beliefs and make my own conclusions rather than following the Bible to the letter. Do you think God wants it to be that simple for us? Should we have a owners manual on how to run our life? Is that his grand plan? So much for us not being robots then because the robots who run as programmed are the only ones who will make it to heaven.\n \n Well I'm rambling now so I'll just await your reply",

I see the Bible as being questionable so I dare not believe what is written in there. Who can say what parts of it are true and what parts are absolutely false. Since I believe in a logical God I know that a logical God would respect a thinking person. I don't pretend to understand him but I try to learn more about him through my experiences in life. I tend to view God as a kind God as well so the simple act of wanting to know more about him will allow me to reveal more about him. For instance with my dog analogy, I think I realized that I felt that way about my dog over a cat for a reason. I think it was a message to me showing me that it really doesn't make sense to believe that God wouldn't create creatures who loved him if what was writting in the Bible was true. Therefore not only does this help me understand more about my opinion on the Bible, but it also helps me realize that love for God isn't the reason that we are here.

   "It is you who goes out onto a limb and judges what is right and wrong. You yourself admit that there are numerous evolutionary schools of thought, yet you have decided that not all of them are to be believed.\n\n \n Right and wrong in regards to the physical world (and always tentative). There are various interpretations of the evidence (we all agree on what the evidence is, so it is objective... however we have different interpretations on what it means) however I'm confident only one explanation is true. People who support various hypotheses will devise ways of proving their own hypothesis, while disproving other hypothesis (all using the scientific method). I don't know which one is most correct now. But eventually one will stand out above the others. \n \n \nWhy isn't it right to take away your rights? What if I needed your kidney? Why are your rights to live greater than mine?\n After-all you're just a random happening of chemicals.\n\n \n This is my own philosophy, not one taught by science, so any questions you have about this only go to me. Any rule made in any society must apply to all people. A society that favored some people over others (even a majority, most, or even all but one) is a danger to everyone. The reason being if we do not ensure the protection of some individual, or minority now, if we were ever to be in that position, we would not be ensured protection either. If you want to enjoy the right to not be physically hurt by another person or group, the you must give the same right to every other person. If you want to enjoy the right to keep any property, or money you earn, then you must give the same right to every other person. This is just a long winded version of the golden rule. But it extends a little bit. We have no right to limit anyone's behavior because it conflicts with our moral views, or opinions, or ethics. We enjoy the right to not live by anyone's moral code but our own, so we can not force anyone to live by our rules. Granted, trying to convince them what they are doing is wrong is fine, but actually physically trying to stop them or limit them is impermissible.",
