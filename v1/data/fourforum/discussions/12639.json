   "Would the following incident be an example of racism?\n \n \nA WOMAN found guilty of assaulting a student after she&#8217;d been asked if she was English was handed a community order yesterday.\n \n Marcia Williams, 18, of Abererch Road, Pwllheli, was previously found guilty of assaulting student Holly Stainer, from Lancaster.\n \n Prosecutor Jim Neary told Llandudno magistrates that at about 11pm last August, Miss Stainer and another student came upon a group of boys and girls arguing at Abersoch.\n \n One of the girls went up to the students and asked them if they were English.\n \n Mr Neary said: &#8220;Miss Stainer heard one say: &#8216;I hate the English. They are fat slags.&#8221; The girl who made the comment wasn&#8217;t Williams.\n \n Miss Stainer was pushed, restrained and punched by the girls including Williams.\n \n Miss Stainer had a swelling to her nose and cuts to her nose and lip.\n \n Mr Neary said the attack was &#8220;totally unprovoked&#8221;.\n \n At the trial, Williams told the court she had drunk lager and vodka at a beach party.\n \n Myrddin Owens, defending, said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think she has a problem with alcohol but there&#8217;s no doubt that alcohol had a part.&#8221; He said Williams, with no previous convictions, was trying to protect her sister.\n \n Williams was handed a 12-month community order, three-month 8pm-3am curfew and ordered to attend an alcohol awareness course. She was told to pay \u00a3150 compensation and \u00a3150 towards costs.\n \n Bench chairman Ann Roberts said: &#8220;It&#8217;s not the type of behaviour we expect.&#8221;\n\n \n Daily Post",

   "Race race - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary\n \n 2. 2 a: a family, tribe, people, or nation belonging to the same stock b: a class or kind of people unified by shared interests, habits, or characteristics\n \n From this definition it may be argued that the Welsh and English are separate races. The welsh have their own language, regional assembly and rugby team. \n \n Racism racism - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary\n \n 2 : racial prejudice or discrimination\n \n The article states \n \n &#8220;Miss Stainer heard one say: &#8216;I hate the English. They are fat slags.&#8221; The girl who made the comment wasn&#8217;t Williams.\" \n \n I think the definitions provided show that is clearly racist abuse and if she believes what she is saying she is racist (there is a difference between racism and racist abuse). Proving that she only attacked the girl because she was English cannot be determined from this article. My advice in future would be for Miss Williams&#8217;s friend to add the following words to the sentence\n \n &#8220;Miss Stainer heard one say: &#8216;I hate some of the English. The ones that are fat slags.&#8221; \n \n This should keep her safe from being accused of racism though some feminists, liberalists and fatties may be insulted.\n \n Racisms only matters at macro level, when large groups of people are through a system denied equal opportunities (what this means can be left to a different discussion). No one will care about this incident because if we are honest, it is just an example of some drunken youth attacking a student.",
