   "  Firearms, ammo see explosive sales growth -- Recession, fear of new federal controls driving increase \n \"A big part of it is the political dynamic,\" Keane said. \"People have legitimate concerns about new regulations [although] economic worries are a factor as well. We are also seeing a goodly number of first-time buyers and firearms safety education courses are filled all over the country.\"\n \n \"Demand for our handguns and tactical rifles yielded first quarter growth, in some cases double-digit growth, in all four of our sales channels, sporting goods, law enforcement, federal government, and international,\" he said. \"Our sales in the consumer channel grew by over 28%.\"\n \n \"You typically see a spike in gun sales during tough economic times, but the fears of Obama took it to another level,\" he said. \"But I think it will start tapering off after this quarter and return to single-digit growth for the consumer business.\"\n \n He also noted that a widespread ammunition shortage, although also starting to abate, may keep some buyers away as they are unlikely to purchase a firearm they won't be able to load, much less fire. Manufactures like ATK and Olin have been ramping up production but are still running behind demand. \n \n \"The demand and orders flow in our commercial business is unprecedented,\" said Bryce Hallowell, a spokesman for ATK, which makes the Federal Premium ammunition brand. \n \n Commercial ammunition sales jumped more than 20% in it latest fiscal year, completed in March, and first-quarter sales rose 25% \"driven by commercial products,\" he said. \"And the market indicators available to us point to continued strength.\" \n \n A clerk at one Chicago area chain store -- just miles from Obama's home turf -- said he had sold more guns in the last year than he had in the previous four. While the displayed assortment of rifles and shotguns on a recent weekday afternoon seemed ample, he said it can empty out quickly and signs warn customers they are limited in the amount of certain kinds of ammunition they could buy.\n \n More recently, \"We have seen and expect to continue to see the year-over-year growth rate in firearms sales decelerate,\" he said. \"However, ammunition sales remained strong with year-over-year growth rates exceeding those of firearms.\" \n \n At American Shooters, a gun store and range just off the Las Vegas Strip, \"business has been very good,\" said Ernie Beckwith, the company's range and education director. \"We are ramping up inventory. The initial gun-buying panic may be over, but the market is still trying to keep up with demand.\" \n \n There is some irony in that the election of someone perceived to be anti-gun has been such a boon to the industry, lamented Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. \n \n \"Obama is the best thing that has happened to them in years,\" he said. \"Their scare tactics before the election turned out to be a total flop politically but great for business.\" \n \n And, he noted, the Obama administration has -- so far at least -- given gun owners very little to worry about. \n \n \"What they proposed during the campaign was moderate and they haven't even made any signs off doing those things,\" Helmke said. \"We have been frustrated with Obama's and Congress' unwillingness to even talk about the gun issue.\" \n \n Helmke believes that time and politics may be on his side, however, and expects the administration to do more later in its term. (So we have been worried for nothing? Antis. Make up your mind! Which is it?) ...\n \n ....many gun owners are far from convinced that the danger has passed. (Not with Helmke's statements!)\n \n \"There is a concern that with a Democratically-controlled Congress and a Democrat in the White House, there could be a move to curtail or limit gun rights,\" he said. \"Every possible scenario has been discussed. We have to win very day but they only have to win once.\" \n \n In the meantime, \"People are buying guns and getting trained. I could teach every weekend if I wanted to,\" he added. \"And prices on everything have risen significantly although we are starting to see some stabilization in supply.\"\n",

   "How much do Americans shoot each year? About 7 billion rounds of ammunition a year. \n   America armed, but guns not necessarily loaded \n Bullet-makers are working around the clock, seven days a week, and still can't keep up with the nation's demand for ammunition.\n \n Shooting ranges, gun dealers and bullet manufacturers say they have never seen such shortages. Bullets, especially for handguns, have been scarce for months because gun enthusiasts are stocking up on ammo, in part because they fear President Barack Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress will pass antigun legislation - even though nothing specific has been proposed and the president last month signed a law allowing people to carry loaded guns in national parks.\n \n Americans usually buy about 7 billion rounds of ammunition a year, according to the National Rifle Association. In the past year, that figure has jumped to about 9 billion rounds, said NRA spokeswoman Vickie Cieplak.\n \n Jason Gregory, who manages Gretna Gun Works just outside of New Orleans, has been building his personal supply of ammunition for months. His goal is to have at least 1,000 rounds for each of his weapons. \n \n \"We've been in business for 32 years and I've been here for 10 and we've never seen anything like it,\" Jett said. \"Coming out of Christmas everything started to dry up and it was that way all through the spring and summer.\n \n Nationwide, distributors are scrambling to fill orders from retailers. \"We used to be able to order 50 or 60 cases and get them in three or four days easy, it was never an issue,\" said Vic Grechniw of Florida Ammo Traders, a distributor in Tampa, Fla. \"Now you are really lucky if you can get one case a month. It just isn't there because the demand is way up.\"\n \n \"If someone wants to shoot on the weekend you have to worry about having the ammunition for them. And I know some people aren't buying to use it at the range, they're taking it home and hoarding it.\" \n \n With demand, prices have also risen. \"Used to be gold, but now lead is the most expensive metal,\" said Donald Richards, 37, who was stocking up at the Jefferson store. \"And worth every penny.\"\n",
