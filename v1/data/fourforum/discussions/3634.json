   "So, I was thinking (and it hurt). The US is a pluralistic society. There are people of many cultures and religions living here and making there lives. We all worship differently and even worship different gods if we do at all. So there are many gods that Americans as a group worship and \"trust.\" \n \n In various official places, usually on a wall in a courtroom and on official seals and money, there is the phrase \"In God We Trust\" But this implies that there is only one god that we as a nation trust. This just isn't the case since there multiple religions and multiple gods that are being trusted. \n \n What would be so bad about adding a little \"s\" right in the middle?\n \n \"In Gods We Trust.\" \n \n At the very least, this is a much more accurate statement.\n Thoughts?\n \n \n .",

Wait, the GPS could mean a new worship symbol requiring even more 'tithes', so maybe that part isn't such a good idea.",
