   "I learned this weekend that my high school sweetheart recently died of kidney disease. The last time I saw her was in 1968. She was a beautiful strawberry blonde with a very sweet disposition. I kick myself for not having wedded and bedded her when I had the chance. \n \n I'm no stranger to death. I watched both my parents die as well as several of my friends. Before going to college, I worked in a hospital where I witnessed death on almost a daily basis. And the sum total of those experiences serve only to convince me that life is meant to be lived to the fullest; that we should strive to experience; to love wastefully; to seize every opportunity, and to cherish every moment. And that includes sorrow. I've learned to not resist sorrow, but to let it wash over me, knowing that the wave will eventually recede.\n \n And I accept my own mortality. I'm not going to be around forever. But it is my intent to experience life to the fullest during my tenure on this planet. What to do with my dead body? Well, throw it into a dumpster for all I care. IMO, the body is nothing more than a vehicle, and when it ceases to function, you dump it as so much trash. \n \n With regard to the hereafter, I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. No sense worrying about it or living my life in preparation for it. How can one possibly prepare for the unknown? The best advice given to me in this regard is \"Do the best you can\". Translation: hurt no one; show mercy and compassion to those less fortunate than you; feed and clothe the poor and hungry; oppose injustice; and love one another. And I maintain that the operative term here is what you do as opposed to what you happen to believe with respect to one or another theology.

   "I learned this weekend that my high school sweetheart recently died of kidney disease. The last time I saw her was in 1968. She was a beautiful strawberry blonde with a very sweet disposition. I kick myself for not having wedded and bedded her when I had the chance. \n \n I'm no stranger to death. I watched both my parents die as well as several of my friends. Before going to college, I worked in a hospital where I witnessed death on almost a daily basis. And the sum total of those experiences serve only to convince me that life is meant to be lived to the fullest; that we should strive to experience; to love wastefully; to seize every opportunity, and to cherish every moment. And that includes sorrow. I've learned to not resist sorrow, but to let it wash over me, knowing that the wave will eventually recede.\n \n And I accept my own mortality. I'm not going to be around forever. But it is my intent to experience life to the fullest during my tenure on this planet. What to do with my dead body? Well, throw it into a dumpster for all I care. IMO, the body is nothing more than a vehicle, and when it ceases to function, you dump it as so much trash. \n \n With regard to the hereafter, I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. No sense worrying about it or living my life in preparation for it. How can one possibly prepare for the unknown? The best advice given to me in this regard is \"Do the best you can\". Translation: hurt no one; show mercy and compassion to those less fortunate than you; feed and clothe the poor and hungry; oppose injustice; and love one another. And I maintain that the operative term here is what you do as opposed to what you happen to believe with respect to one or another theology. You do these things because they are right and proper in and of themselves.\n\n \n Amen to that. All of it, every word you said.",

   "Orion, God Himself already came to earth and told you what the program is. You, like everyone, have sins to account for, and you need the blood and righteousness of Christ in order to get into heaven. The way to Christ is written in God's Word:\n \n For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith-and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God- not by works, so that no one can boast. - Ephesians 2:8-9\n \n You say, \"Do the best you can\" (and you presumably will be ok in the afterlife). God says salvation is not by \"works\" but by faith in Christ as your Lord and Savior for the remission of your sins. As the Scripture says,\n \n \"But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life. This is a trustworthy saying.\" - Titus 3:4-8\n \n So before you check out, check in with Jesus. His word is a lot more trustworthy than that advice you got from a mere mortal.

   "What even Buddisists, shintoists, moslems, hindus and seikhs? Or all these in the grip of satan?\n\n \n Among the religious leaders who have attained a large following throughout history, Jesus Christ is unique in the fact that He alone claimed to be God in human flesh. A common misconception is that some or many of the leaders of the world's religions made similar claims, but this is simply not the case. Buddha did not claim to be God; Moses never said the he was Yahweh; Mohammed did not identify himself as Allah; and nowhere will you find Zoroaster claiming to be Ahura Mazda. Yet Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, said that he who has seen Him (Jesus) has seen the Father. (John 14:9)\n \n The claims of Christ are many and varied. He said that He existed before Abraham (John 8:58), and that He was equal with the Father (John 5:17-18). Jesus claimed the ability to forgive sins (Mark 2:5-7), which the Bible teaches was something that God alone could do (Isaiah 43:25).\n \n The New Testament equated Jesus as the Creator of the Universe (John 1:3), and that He is the one who holds everything together (Colossians 1:17). The Apostle Paul says that God was manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16), and John the evangelist says that \"the Word was God\" (John 1:1). The united testimony of Jesus and the writers of the New Testament is that He was more than mere man; He was God.\n \n Not only did His friends notice that He claimed to be God, but so did His enemies. There may be some doubt today among the skeptics who refuse to examine the evidence, but there was no doubt of the Jewish authorities. When Jesus asked them why they wanted to stone Him, they replied, \"For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God.\" (John 10:33, NASB). This fact separates Jesus from the other religious figures. In the major religions of the world, the teachings--not the teacher--are all important.\n \n Confucianism is a set of teachings. Confucius is not important. Islam is the revelation of Allah, with Muhammad being the prophet, and Buddhism emphasizes the principles of the Buddha and not Buddha himself. This is especially true of Hinduism, where there is no historic founder.\n \n However, at the center of Christianity is the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus did not just claim to be teaching the truth; He claimed that He was\n the truth. (John 14:6) What Jesus taught is not the important aspect of Christianity, but what is important is who Jesus was. Was He the Son of God? Is He the only way a person can reach God?This was the claim He made for Himself.\n \n Suppose this very night the president of the United States appeared on all the major networks and proclaimed that \"I am God Almighty. I have the power to forgive sin. I have the authority to raise my life back from the dead.\" He would be quickly and quietly shut off the air, led away, and replaced by the vice-president. Anybody who would dare to make such claims would have to be either out of his mind or a liar, unless he was God.\n This is exactly the case with Jesus. He clearly claimed all these things and more. If He is God, as He claimed, we must believe in Him, and if He is not, then we should have nothing to do with him. Jesus is either Lord of all or not Lord at all.\n \n Yes, Jesus claimed to be God. Why should anyone believe it? After all, merely claiming to be something does not make it true. Where's the evidence that Jesus is God? The Bible gives various reasons, including miracles and fulfilled prophecy, that are intended to convince us that Jesus is the one whom He said He was (John 20:30-31). The main reason, or the sign which Jesus Himself said would demonstrate that He was the Son of God, was His resurrection from the dead.\n \n When asked for a sign from the religious leaders, Jesus replied, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40, RSV) In another place He said, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up . . . but he spake of the temple of his body\" (John 2:19, 2 KJV). The ability to raise His life back from was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone else who has ever lived.\n \n Anyone wishing to refute the case for Christianity must explain away the story of the resurrection.Therefore, according to the Bible, Jesus proves to be the Son of God by coming back from the dead (Romans 1:4). The evidence is overwhelming that Jesus did rise from the grave, and it is this fact that proves Jesus to be God. - by Josh McDowell\n \n From the Josh McDowell book \"Answers to Tough Questions\", pp. 72-75.",
