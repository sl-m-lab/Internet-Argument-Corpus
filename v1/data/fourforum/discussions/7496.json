   "Last month the Pilgrim Baptist Church in Chicago burned to the ground while undergoing renovation. This church was described by various news accounts as being the home of modern American gospel music. \n \n Recently the governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich, pledged one million dollars to help rebuild the church. This seems like a gross violation of church/state separation, yet he claims in an article in the Chicago Tribune:\n \n \n \"...that Pilgrim Baptist was a historical landmark in the African-American community, serving as a haven for blacks during migrations from the South. In addition, in the 1950s, and especially in the 1960s, this unique historic church was a place of tremendous activity and an anchor in the civil rights movement...\" \n \n \n It may be worth noting the governor is facing re-election this year.\n \n Question: Is the appeal to a historic site a red herring? Should taxpayer dollars be used--in this church or any other church--to rebuild what will essentially be a private organization for use by its members?",

   "I misspoke. The governor has pledged the money to rebuild the church's school and admin offices, which were also damaged in the fire. This is the fine line Blagojevich is walking to avoid the obvious problem. It was so subtle that I missed it the first time I read it. But in pledging money for those expenditures, isn't he in effect freeing the congregation of its rightful duty to shoulder the expense of rebuilding? Money is fungible.\n \n I don't believe as a public citizen that I could partake in their services and share communion for instance. I would have to become a member first. At least, this is how other Baptist denominations are set up.\n \n I think this is a blatant ploy for the black vote in the gubernatorial election, and he should not be allowed to spend public dollars on a private concern. His trick to not earmark monies for the sanctuary itself should fool no one.",

His trick to not earmark monies for the sanctuary itself should fool no one.\n\n \n Your assertion that it's a ploy may be true, but I don't see that as relevant. Would you care if he was rebuilding a black school, or a building that played largely in black history that wasn't a church? I'm guessing no, it's the fact that it's a church that concerns you. \n \n Under what circumstances can the government skirt seperation of church and state? One of them is when there is a compelling government interest. It seems to me that getting a school rebuilt, as well as a historical landmark, could qualify. It really depends on the details. Is the school open to all? Is it really a historically significant building? Based on the info you've supplied I'd say the Governor is more guilty of buying votes than violating seperation of church and state.",

Seperation of church and state is meant to keep the government from endorsing religion. From your description, it sounds like the governor isn't doing that, he's just buying votes. A waste of taxpayer money perhaps, but not a SOCAS issue. It's not like government money can't ever be used to help a religious cause, it just can't do it in a way which supports the religion. Most of the time the two go hand in hand, but there are exceptions.",
