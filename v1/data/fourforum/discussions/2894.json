   "I am not google savvy enough to pull a quote from a bush speach that was made 3 years ago. There is an interesting article by Michael Moran at http://www.msnbc.com/news/643471.asp?cp1=1\nAn interesting thing about your article is that it inadvertently undercuts your claim that Bush commended al-Jazeera for impartial reporting. I'll return to Moran's article in a moment, but first it's worth noting your description of self as short on Google savvy. More than once on prior occasions you told me to \"Google it!\" when I asked for evidence to back up what were surely false statements. It appeared that 'Google it!' was your euphemism for indirectly acknowledging your lack of evidence. But now you present yourself claiming that your deficiency of Google savvy is genuine. Though that may be the case, it doesn't relieve you of primary responsibility for substantiating the accuracy of your own statements.\n \n Here's my view of this instance. You said Bush commended al-Jazeera for impartial reporting. You further maintained that Bush's praise of al-Jazeera during the Afghan War \"is fairly common knowledge.\" I imagine that if such 'knowledge' is in fact fairly common, then it is reasonable to assume your Google search should not have failed to uncover evidence of your claim.\n \n Your characterization of \"Bush's speech\" remains questionable, especially in light of your inability to back it up. I was content to let it remain in the realm of the 'possible, but highly unlikely.' Then, after excusing yourself for insufficient Google savvy, you immediately offered up a Michael Moran article -- \"In Defense of al-Jazeera\" -- that you perhaps stumbled on while seeking evidence of your Bush commendation of al-Jazeera.\n \n I have no complaint about the thrust of Moran's column. The Arabic-speaking community in the Middle East was long overdue for a TV station like al-Jazeera. The station is independent by Mideast media standards, and it appears to give voice to a range of political backgrounds from fundamentalists to liberals. It's unreasonable to think al-Jazeera would tout a pro-American view. The station generally espouses a pan-Arab nationalist political line, which is to be expected. Of course, that doesn't mean they're impartial. Frankly, I can't imagine Bush publicly commending even FOX network for impartiality. Can anyone recall the last time that ANY administration commended the media for being unbiased?\n \n Which brings me back to Moran and his connection to Bush's alleged commendation of al-Jazeera. Moran wrote his column defending al-Jazeera in October 2001, just weeks after the 9-11 attack. It was still early in the Afghan War, the very time frame in which Bush supposedly praised al-Jazeera in a speech. Yet Moran's article states that the Bush administration had been 'launching attacks' on al-Jazeera at this time. How does one reconcile the discrepancy between Bush's praise of al-Jazeera (per Daewoo's claim) and Bush's attacks on al-Jazeera (per Daewoo's link)?\n \n Three weeks after Moran wrote his column, and just before the Northern Alliance marched into the Afghan capital city, the U.S. military dropped a 500 pound bomb on the studios of al-Jazeera's TV station in Kabul.",

   "I remember the first images of the statue falling and was surprised at how few people were there. I see more people at a Macdonalds during lunch then were at the toppling of the statue.\n\n \n Good point! The relative scarcity of people in Firdos Square suggests that the toppling of the statue was more a matter of spontaneity than staging. If the U.S. had actually staged the whole thing, as Daewoo speculates, then one might surely imagine that there would have been considerable arrangement for many more Iraqis to be on hand for the cameras. After all, what if it were your job to stage a major event right next to the Palestine Hotel, where most of the international journalists were staying. Send out the casting call. Bring in thousands of movie extras. You want a huge jubilant crowd? Well, folks, you got it!\n \n The reality of course is that the crowd was sparse, as media cameras looked down on the mostly empty square from the adjacent hotel. Considering these circumstances, it's more reasonable to assume that the toppling of the statue was mostly spontaneous, not only as regards the Iraqis milling about the square, but also the Marines that provided the vehicle to pull it down, as well as the Army Psyops team that tried to make the most of the opportunity as presented. If it were truly staged, then why no big crowd for the camera's of the media circus?\n \n I'm not clear why you were surprised to see fewer people in the square than you might encounter at McDonald's at lunchtime. I would understand such surprise if you were inclined to believe that the statue toppling was staged. I, too, would be surprised at such poor stage management.\n \n It might help your understanding if you're mindful of the context of the moment. It was only the 9th of April. The U.S. military was still probing the city's sectors for resistance. Saddam's regime in Baghdad was in an ongoing state of collapse. Just blocks from Firdos Square, Marine units were engaging regime elements in firefights. Why should ordinary Iraqis want to risk their lives meandering the streets at this juncture of the battle? How many people might you encounter at your neighborhood McDonald's when a war is going on around you?",

I doubt he's aware of the bogus details he posted. Nevertheless, none of those pages will confirm his account.\n \n That the whole thing was staged is a matter of opinion.

None of them appear to confirm Daewoo's accounting of the incident. Since you offer no personal comments yourself, I'm uncertain what position, if any, you hoped to convey with these links.\n \n For the sake of precision, let's revisit Daewoo's statement. He said, \"the military admitted that they staged the whole thing and they brought Arabs in from Jordan to pull down the statue.\"\n \n There are at least two parts to his claim: 1) the military admitted staging the whole thing, and 2) the military brought in Jordanians to topple the statue.\n \n The first URL, the interview with anti-war activist Neville Watson, has no admission by the military that the whole thing was staged, nor does Watson himself say that the toppling was staged. Of the statue incident, he is mainly critical of the media's presentation of the event, saying the televised images didn't match his personal impressions. There's nothing useful here to uphold the first part of Daewoo's claim. Nor does it support the second part. Indeed, Watson's comments are at odds with the claim that Jordanians were imported for the event. Watson was told-by a source he doesn't identify-that the crowd consisted of local Iraqis from Saddam City-now Sadr City-a Baghdad district near the square.\n \n Your second URL links to a page posted by the Washington DC outlet of Indymedia, a left-wing organization. Indymedia cautions the reader to be wary of this article, since it was contributed anonymously. The anonymity is a moot point, however, since the article doesn't directly address the issue at hand. As with the first URL, this link includes no admission by the military. But in contrast with the first URL, this link proposes that the Iraqis involved in the statue toppling were outsiders-specifically, members of Chalabi's militia-rather than local Iraqis from Baghdad (per Neville Watson) or imported Jordanians (per Daewoo).\n \n Your third URL gets warm. It links to a DC-area affiliate of ABC News in which a local reporter reveals \"fascinating details\" from 'On Point,' the U.S. Army study of Operation Iraqi Freedom. I think this link is only warm, not hot, because it links to a transcript of a brief news report by WJLA-TV when it might have linked to the army study itself. Even so, according to the WJLA transcript, the TV reporter ends her report with this statement: \"THE ARMY SAID IT STANDS BY ITS REPORT AND THAT NO ONE HAS QUESTIONED ITS VALIDITY.\"\n \n But what, exactly, did the U.S. Army say? Who read the report?\n \n Perhaps your offer to 'find more URLs' is an indication you recognize the shortcomings in the URLs already presented. Posting more URLs of similar substance isn't necessary. If, however, you find a link in which the U.S. military admits the statue toppling was staged and/or that Jordanians were brought in to topple the statue, please do post it for our edification.\n \n Meanwhile, here's a link to the army study's Table of Contents. The Foreward, Preface, Acknowledgments, and Introduction are useful in adding perspective to the study. After that, the section most pertinent to this thread - Toppling the Statue--Army PSYOP Supports I MEF - is found in Chapter 6.",

   "As for my own opinion, I believe that the way it was reported to the general public was biased,\nNo doubt most of the reporting from Iraq is biased, but if that was your point, then it would appear your complaint is with the media, not the military.\n \n Yet the URLs you provided to Jim were in direct response to his request for links that would substantiate Daewoo's allegation that the whole thing was staged by the military. By providing him with select URLs that are themselves biased, you helped convey the impression that the toppling indeed was staged.\n \n Now you say it \"doesn't really matter\" whether the crowd in the square was \"fake\" or not -- in other words, whether the incident was staged or not. But that of course was the very focus of Jim's request for links. As for bias, it's not an issue for only the media to confront. In my view, it wasn't fair to Jim that he gets a prejudiced selection of URLs that carry the sensation of it being a staged event. Jim's impression was confirmed in his subsequent remark: \"I must have been out of the country when that was hot news. SkioozeMe!\"\n \n \n \nwhat matters is that it was reported as a show of Iraqi support for the US invasion, which obvisiously at that time and place there wasnt any real support.\nMillions of Iraqis--the majority--welcomed U.S. military action to depose Saddam's regime. Dozens of them were in Firdos Square when the statue was toppled. You say it's \"obvious\" there was no support, but your own URLs refute that assessment. It's fair to say the crowd was small, but why pretend it didn't exist. There are many photos and videos of jubilant Iraqis breaking apart the toppled statue and dragging its head through the streets, with many onlookers relishing the insult of slapping the statue's head with their shoes.\n \n The toppling of the statue was significant as a symbol of the collapse of Saddam's regime. Though few Iraqis may have been in Firdos Square that day as a personal witness, the assertion that there was no Iraqi support for the U.S. serves to undercut your valid criticism of media bias and shift the spotlight to your own.\n \n Media bias is a fact of life and isn't going away. What would you propose? Perhaps the most we can do is take note of it as we process the news we're exposed to. The statue toppling isn't the first time the media made an event look larger in scale than it was in reality. On the spectrum of mental manipulation by the media, I think the statue story is relatively benign. Compare it to the tight camera angles used for stories of Iraqi 'crowds' dancing and mugging for cameras around a burnt military convoy truck, when in reality the number of participants dancing are equalled or outnumbered by the media teams capturing the action.",

Most Liberals(Democrats) like to \"make up\" the \"facts\" to fit their own pre-conceived opinion(that America is always wrong). Your cogent argument, however, will be wasted on most liberals(Democrats) as tthey choose to ignore logic and facts. They want to \"feel\" rather than think.",

   "mypov,\n \n Thanks for replying. I generally speak to the facts in my writing, so my personal opinions or deepest convictions are not always apparent. This post to you is an exception. It's all opinion, and it's prompted by your equating \"liberals(Democrats)\" with those who ignore logic and facts or who make up facts to fit pre-conceived notions. The left leaning wing of our political spectrum has no monopoly on the attributes you cite, as there are those who are right of center that are likewise content to 'feel' instead of think. But that's not my point either. My modest gripe is with the use of the term \"liberal\" as a derisive label.\n \n I see the tide has turned, and I harbor no illusions that anything I say will reverse the trend of recent years. There is a lot scorn these days directed at the term 'liberal.' Detractors claim it means someone who is irresponsible in spending, eager to increase the size and scope of government, and in favor of levying more taxes on a weary public. In short, being labeled a liberal these days is not meant as a compliment.\n \n But in my youth it was most certainly a different word, a great and good word. It denoted a person of thoughtful ideas and high ideals. Liberals stood for fairness and equality. They opposed segregation with courage, determination, and compassion. They promoted the idea that color, gender, creed, and economic status should not be an impediment to opportunity. They thought that might does not necessarily make right, that persuasion and compromise are preferable to resolving conflict than mere force. They believed every human life has value, that the goal of a free society is to provide all citizens with the chance to realize their full potential, and that all of us benefit when that goal is reached.\n \n I still think 'liberal' means all these things. It saddens me that a good word has been distorted by those who would advance a less enlightened agenda.\n \n I believe every person should stand equal before the law. I believe the purpose of government is to protect citizens against acts of aggression, violence, and fraud, and that government has the obligation to ensure that our air, water, and land is not polluted by those who put profit above principle.\n \n I believe that what adults do consensually in the privacy of their homes is not the government's business. I believe the reason we have the principle of the 'separation of church and state' is to protect both the church and the state.\n \n I believe every citizen--human or corporate--should pay his, her, or its fair share of taxes because we all benefit from the things we do in common, and when some avoid their fair share, the rest of us have to make it up. I believe that if welfare is destructive of individual initiative, then corporate welfare is likewise destructive of free enterprise.\n \n I believe that military strength provides security for our nation, but squandering that strength weakens us. There are times when we must strike back, but very few times when we must strike first.\n \n I believe that wealth is fine, but greed is destructive. I believe that business is the engine of the American dream, but that businessmen should not dictate public policy, and elected officials should concern themselves with the good of all citizens, not just contributors.\n \n I believe that we are the greatest and richest country in history, and that we can meet the needs of every citizen and still have some left over to help the world--if we have the will and the vision. \n \n Unity is the key idea in the words 'United States.' We need to govern ourselves with the understanding that we are only as strong as our weakest link. We must commit ourselves to ensuring the strength of every citizen in order to ensure the strength of our nation. We bear a responsibility to each other, to ourselves, and to posterity.\n \n People may call me a liberal for some of these beliefs, and that's fine with me. I simply call myself an American.",

It had nothing to do with Dems/Reps. It had to do with white people being paranoid and racist, period.\n \n \n(LBJ was proably the WORST Commander in Chief EVER!)\n\n Yeah! And Nixon came in and cleaned it all up, right?\n It has everything to do with party affiliation, right?\n \n \nI don't remember Republicana/conservatives LIEing or PRETENDING they were liberal just to get elected. For the most part they tried to convince, with truth, the American people. Not lie to them to get elected and then get into office to do the reverse of what they promosed.\n\n You have been around the past 4 years under W, haven't you? Of course, he'd love to convince you he's a compassionate conservative. Please don't tell us that you think W is what he says, or that he's got an honest bone in his body.",

That was simple enough.\n 2) If I must feed you a definition of \"liberal\" for you to jump on, it would be someone who believes in values that are progressive and not limited by tradition, but support the well-being of every individual and society as a whole. And, what does that have to do with this?\n 3) I wish that I had been in a state of suspended animation these past four years, but yes, I have been subjected to 4 years of listening to W murder the english language, spit on the constitution, and change the terror color (well 3 years of that).\n 4) To clarify: There was much more dicrimination in the 1970s than there is now, as was pointed out by your fine colleague. He tried to link discrimination and the democratic party somehow. I just pointed out that there was more discrimination against blacks where there were more blacks (duh!). Anyone who was doing the discriminating was white (99% chance of that, I'd say). These white people were paranoid and racist. If you still can't understand then I doubt I'll be able to explain it to you.",
