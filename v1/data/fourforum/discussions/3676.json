   "But it wasn't intended to. Perhaps if you educated yourself before you spoke.\n\n It's very easy to say \"Not it's not\", it's even easier to add ad hominem... especially for you. You do both so often.\n \n The Miller-Urey experiments were to show how life possible could come about through a process of abiogenesis. To test the theories of Oparin and Urey. \n Miller was testing a theory by Urey (hypothesised independently of Oparin)\n \"Oparin, a Russian scientist, began the modern idea of the origin of life when he published a pamphlet in 1924\"\n Dr. Stanley L. Miller\n http://www.accessexcellence.org/WN/NM/miller.html\n \n They were the first steps in a step-by-step naturalistic attempt at explanation that failed at the very first hurdle. Because it failed, most people like yourself pretend that it was never meant to be an 'Origin of Life' experiment. Fortunately, a few scientists are a little more honest\n \"The Original Origin-of-Life Experiment\" by Leslie Orgel\n http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/2948/orgel.html\n (LESLIE E. ORGEL is senior fellow and research professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego)\n \"The experiment is considered to be the classic experiment on the origin of life.\"\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_experiment\n \"Miller/Urey Experiment\n By the 1950s, scientists were in hot pursuit of the origin of life.\"\n http://www.chem.duke.edu/~jds/cruise_chem/Exobiology/miller.html\n \n You could argue that they weren't about life, but the building blocks of life. And you'd find some support for this claim.\n Under a general topic \"Origins of Life...Part 4: Experimental studies of the origins of life....\"\n http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/courses/EEB105/lectures/Origins_of_Life/origins.html you can cover Miller-Urey at the Uni of Arizona.\n \n The problem here is the failure of science to catch hold of their own propaganda. They (the team) proudly hailed they were on the way once and for all for showing how life began. The press got hold of this, and popular science did to. It got taught in my school as a truth (in the mid-1980s) and is still taught by some. But when the science behind it began to get questioned, the failures were brought to light.\n \"More than 30 years of experimentation on the origin of life in the fields of chemical and molecular evolution have led to a better perception of the immensity of the problem of the origin of life on Earth rather than to its solution. At present all discussions on principal theories and experiments in the field either end in stalemate or in a confession of ignorance (1988, 13[4]:348).\"\n http://www.apologeticspress.org/docsdis/2003/dc-03-03.htm\n Now it's the apologists that go out there saying it was never about life. And eventually, this will filter back into the real world, so that the claim and what is taught will by in sync, once more.\n \n Hey, when are you going to fess up about the history of creationism? Answer: Never.\n When are you going to fess up that Darwin was wrong to use a tautology? Answer: Never.\n \n For you a discussion is a series of attempts at point scoring and moralising about my honesty, yet you offer no apologies for your errors and insults.

There was no expectation in the Miller/Urey experiments that life would be produced. The experiments were never intended to do that. There is quite a difference between life and organic molecules. The prediction was that if an electrical spark were generated in an atmosphere that they thought may have been similar to the early atmosphere of earth, that amino acids, necessary molecules for the formation of life, would form. They were right about the amino acids. They were most likely wrong about the makeup of the early atmosphere. You are wrong about what Miller/Urey tried to show.\n \n Pointing out your mistakes is not an ad hominem. I'm not sure why you are so defensive. Is it that your ego is unable to tolerate the knowledge that you have made a mistake? It seems so. Really, read your posts with pity for your unwillingness to learn and your unwillingness to admit your errors.\n \n I was aware of the work of Miller/Urey shortly after they published their paper. I was aware at the time of the purpose of the work since we discussed it in my genetics class. The purpose was not to show that how life could come about through abiogenesis. At that time, the formation of amino acids through some process other than production by living organisms was a problem. Without amino acids there is no life. We have since learned that amino acids are produced in several ways, sparks in nitrogen and amonia and methane being only one, and probably not the correct composition of the early atmosphere of earth to boot. Amino acids have also been found in meteors. It seems that they are formed in several ways so their availability for early life isn't an issue any more. I don't understand why you wish to misrepresent the facts. Perhaps you don't know the facts.\n \n There are other interesting developments in abiogenesis research in the last year. (I certainly hope that you are aware that we are not discussing the theory of biological evolution since that involves changes in living organisms. I suspect not. Please think about it and try to grasp the concept.) Two viruses have been assembled from raw materials. Science now has the ability to assemble chains of RNA or DNA in a specific order. Since the sequence of the polio virus is known, a successful attempt was made to assemble it from raw materials - i.e., bases, ribose, and phosphates. The artificial polio virus was indistinguishable from the real thing.\n \n A second virus was also artificially constructed. This one was based on a bacteriophage, although not identical to it.

That was done several years ago.

It is one thing to say \"Pointing out your mistakes is not ad hominem\". As that is a statement that is not ad hominem, but then to rant about ego etc is just pointless. And that's why I continually raise it with you. Instead of just saying \"You're wrong\", you like to include extra little bits to make you feel better.\n Further to that, although I might be wrong, my reading of it (as shown by some quoting) suggests that you are. So berating me about 'educating myself' is rather odd, because I am reading about it.\n \nI was aware of the work of Miller/Urey shortly after they published their paper.

In the almost twenty years from school (where I was first taught that Miller had done this other readings have only confirmed this. This is not meant to be an 'appeal to authority', but as shown by some of my citations there's a big world out there that believes different from you.\n \nThere are other interesting developments in abiogenesis research in the last year. (I certainly hope that you are aware that we are not discussing the theory of biological evolution since that involves changes in living organisms. I suspect not.

This new virus reproduced and attacked bacteria just like the model on which it was based.\n \nOf course, the question is, are viruses living?\n\n I recall this from my Biology class, that they can 'switch off' and in that sense are no longer 'alive', then they can switch on again.\n \nBut there's more. A bacterium has been genetically altered so that it now produces and uses 21 amino acids in the production of proteins (ALL life on earth uses only 20 amino acids, encoded by 64 codons composed of 4 bases.)\n\n This still doesn't get over the problem of how life on a prebiotic world came into being. It also isn't convincing when you have an experiment involving an intelligence to show how something came about by pure chance.\n \nOf course, self replicating molecules are an old story along with lipid membranes.
