   "The reason homosexuals want the right to marry is so they can express their love, a human and a goat are not capable of loving each other as two humans can. There will never be a strong fight for it, because an animal is incapable of romantic love, they are not even capable of understanding it. All we have to do to avoid interspecies marriage is fight for marriage between those who love each other. That means supporting gay marriage, because sometimes someone who is gay and in denial will marry a woman, not out of love but as an attempt to prove that they're straight. Legalized marriage for homosexuals would increase acceptance, thus decreasing denial and lower divorce rates. People should also fight the trivialized version of marriage that exists today, that seems to define marriage as 'a man and a woman' but often forgets the part that says 'who love each other', by getting rid of marriages on reality shows and discouraging the celebrity weddings that end in divorce faster than an average teenager's relationship. This kind of marriage is way more likely to end up in a goat marriage than homosexual couples getting married. After all, can't you picture it now? 'Our future bride will win one million dollers if she will marry the man of our choice...but what will she do when she sees that the 'man' is a goat?'\n \n As for the homosexuality leading into inter family relationships, I fail to see how one could possibly lead into the other. After all, inter family relationships were once seen as a good thing, at a time when you could be arrested for having sex with a member of the same sex. If anything, the success of homosexual arguments would push back the success of inter family ones. After fighting for making things better than ever before, even if it means changing tradition, you would have to go and fight for making things like they were. Any argument made by a gay rights activist or homosexual could easily be refuted by, 'would you like things to go back to the way they were when you couldn't marry, too?'. If gay rights became something everyone accepted, then anyone could use the gay argument to fight the marriage of two people in the same family.",

It completely and utterly fails me.\n\n \n Okay, I agree that everyone should be able to settle down with someone they love and want to spend the rest of their lives with. I am trying to say that if gay marriage is allowed, it will be viewed as a 'concession' and the logical consequences are people that want something more. Suppose gay marriage is just not quite enough for you. You want more. You have gotten a concession from society, now you have alot more ammunition to push WHATEVER agenda onto the public you choose to. I never said bestiality or incest were related in any way to homosexuality. I don't believe that they are. I believe that certain deviates will fight for their right to do those things based on the consessions of our government.\n \n To make an example of my views- not trying to hijack this thread- I use the NRA's fight. Consider- whether you are pro or against gun ownership is irrelevent here, I only make an example- the NRA has been fighting gun control since its inception, right? Well it took me a long time to realize why they are so fervently fighting bans on assault weapons. Then it hit me: If they make any concession at all, they are going to lose the fight- one small concession at a time- until there are not only no assualt weapons allowed, but no hand-guns, and then, since they caved on that issue, there would be no more rifles for hunting, then, guess what! No more BB guns or pellet guns used for target shooting. And then, as long as we're here, we might as well take away your right to own a sling shot, or a bow and arrow... or a knife!!\n \n Now, let's look again at the gay marriage issue...\n So you are allowed to marry someone of the same sex. That fight is over, now we have ammunition to use when we say \"I don't like the saying 'In God We Trust' on my money, and I want the government to change it.\" Well, that was an easy fight, now I want absolutely every mention of God or religion of any kind removed from tv and radio. Wow, these fights are getting easier every day! Let's try legalizing pot, because it only hurts the one smoking it! (I don't really believe that). Let's make not only partial birth abortion legal, let's make abortion legal no matter how young you are or how far along you are! let's kill newborn babies- what's the difference, 30 seconds?\n \n Extreme? I don't think so. \n \n STU\n (sorry about the rant)",

What's the point of making a different word? Wouldn't it be easier just to say married anyway? After all, marriage is a name everyone associates with love. Another word, with the same meaning, would be unable to convey that love as well because people didn't grow up associating the word with marriage. For example, what did you think of when you first heard the phrase 'civil union' before you knew what it meant? I thought it sounded like some legal thing. Also, words are important. It has been found that in cultures where there are different words for a different shades of a color, people in that culture notice the difference in the shades more.
