   "VoteVets.org says 'The bulls-eye on the back of our troops just got a whole lot bigger, and the president is to blame'\n \n NEW YORK - Public confirmation that the White House sees an American military presence in Iraq without end is the single greatest motivating and recruiting tool given to insurgents in the history of the war, and must be recanted, Iraq Veterans said today.\n \n Jon Soltz, head of the largest political group of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, VoteVets.org, said, \"The president and vice-president like to say that insurgents in Iraq listen to what we say over here. If they do, there's no question that this morning, those who seek to kill our troops are buzzing with talk that America plans on occupying Iraq forever. The bulls-eye on the back of our troops just got a whole lot bigger, and the president is to blame. He has to recant these kinds of statements, so he doesn't embolden the enemy more than he already has.\"\n \n Yesterday, the president's press secretary, Tony Snow, said the president envisions the length of US military involvement in Iraq to be similar to Korea. The United States has maintained a presence in Korea for more than 50 years.\n \n \"Maybe the White House hasn't been keeping track of the news, but American troops haven't faced constant fire from insurgents in Korea, and the Koreans have asked us to stay there. Poll after poll shows we are not welcome by the majority of Iraqi civilians, and saying that we're going to stay for fifty years whether they like it or not just serves to create enemies at a faster clip. We cannot overestimate how incredibly irresponsible and dangerous the president's stated position is,\" Soltz added.\n \n A USA Today Poll this year showed 78% of Iraqi adults oppose the presence of coalition forces in Iraq; only 22% support it. Only one percent of Iraqis want the US military presence to go on without end.\n \n \"Every member of Congress also has to protect our troops by strongly rebuking the president, so Iraqis know that our legislative branch will not allow the president's vision to come to fruition,\" he concluded.",

   "Whatever this Marine had in mind, he seems to have forgotten that his stint in Iraq came about due to the \"fact\" that he volunteered for the service. Maybe he thought that he was joining the peace corp instead of the Marine Corp. \n You don't get to pick and choose what conflicts you will participate in. \n The Corp is not a Democracy. At least in America the only thing he is being challenged on is that he wore a uniform. I wonder if any ex-Al Queda protest the war they have engaged in.......?",
