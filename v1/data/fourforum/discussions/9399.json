The amendment need 50 votes of support to advance.\n \n If it makes it on the ballot and residents approve it, the constitutional amendment would leave Massachusetts' existing same-sex marriages intact but ban any new ones.\n \n About 8,000 same-sex couples have wed in Massachusetts since the Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 2003 that the state Constitution guarantees gays the right to marry. A few other states offer civil unions with similar rights for gay couples, but only Massachusetts allows gay marriage.\n \n Backers of the amendment argue that it should be up to the people, not the courts, to define something as important as marriage.\n \n Supporters of gay marriage say the civil rights of a minority should not be put to a popular vote.\n \n Democratic Gov.-elect Deval Patrick on Tuesday had met with leading lawmakers and urged them to skip the vote, calling it a \"question of conscience\" and saying the amendment process was being used \"to consider reinserting discrimination into the constitution.\"\n \n Since Tuesday was the final day of the session, skipping the vote would have effectively killed the amendment effort.\n \n Instead, the Senate president called for a vote shortly after opening the constitutional convention, though he left open a chance for parliamentary maneuvers by gay marriage supporters to try to reverse the vote.\n \n \"I'm very proud that we took a vote,\" said Democratic Sen. Sue Tucker, who opposed the amendment. \"I think we owed the people that. At the same time, I'm also equally proud of my 'no' vote.\"\n \n Last fall, the Legislature had angered the amendment's backers and Gov. Mitt Romney when it recessed without voting on the amendment. They appealed to the state Supreme Judicial Court, which said it was powerless to intervene but chastised lawmakers, saying they had shirked their constitutional duties by not voting at all.\n \n Lawmakers arriving for Tuesday's vote were greeted outside the Statehouse by crowds of gay marriage supporters and opponents waving signs.\n \n \"Legislators are sent to Beacon Hill to vote on a matter, not to not vote on a matter,\" said amendment backer Paul Ferro, 30, of Norton.\n \n A sign in the crowd of amendment supporters nearby read, \"Let the people vote,\" while at the pro-gay marriage rally across the street, another sign read, \"Let the people marry.\"",

   "The law won the day in Massachusetts.\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/02/samesex.marriage.ap/\n\n \n How sad. Well, with the 132 people voting against moving it forward vs. the 61 that voted to move the proposal to ban gay marriage forward, it shows how overwhelming the support for gay marriage is there. I hope that if it eventually goes to the ballot, that the people of Massachusetts vote against the bigoted amendment. If not, there is always the courts which can rule it unconstitutional. \n \n It's really sad to see the US reduced to a third-world country in terms of the rights of their citizens. Just look at all the places that allow gay marriage: Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Canada, and South Africa, plus the countries that allow civil unions offering varying amounts of marriage rights: Andorra, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Isreal (doesn't allow it but recognized them from other countries), Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kindom. They are also available in parts of Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, as well as all Australian states and territories. \n Wow, that's quite a list. Just look at all of the countries that are more advanced than us in this issue.\n \n And what's more, here are some places even here in our third world mentality that allow some rights either through government or by large companies: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, Vermont, Washington DC, and Massachusetts. Even these places have seen the inequality that is being pushed by the religious bigots of the world.",
