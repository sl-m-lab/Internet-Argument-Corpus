   "Chuck Schumer has introduced a bill that would make it a crime to transfer a firearm without a background check. He has styled it the \"Fix Gun Checks Act of 2011\": \n \n S. 436 | U.S. Senate Bill | Fix Gun Checks Act of 2011\n \n A quick glance at the proposed legislation reveals the following:\n \n `(a) Definitions- In this section-- \n `(1) the term `unlicensed transferee' means a person who-- \n `(A) is not licensed under this chapter; and \n `(B) desires to received a firearm from an unlicensed transferor; and \n `(2) the term `unlicensed transferor' means a person who-- \n `(A) is not licensed under this chapter; and \n `(B) desires to transfer a firearm to an unlicensed transferee.\n \n The proposed legislation makes it a crime for an \"unlicensed transferor\" to transfer a firearm to an \"unlicensed transferee\" without a background check.\n \n All transfers must be done through the assistance of a background check conducted by either a FFL dealer or a local law enforcement agency, unless the state requires a firearm \"permit,\" in which case the \"unlicensed transferor\" may transfer the firearm if the \"unlicensed transferee's\" permit is not more than five years old.\n \n Some exceptions to this law appear to be \"temporary transfers\" (like allowing someone else to hold and shoot your gun at a qualified recognized shooting range-but apparently not for shooting on the family's \"back 40.\" Also allowed for temporary purposes while hunting), transfers for immediate self-defense in life threatening situations, for gifts within the immediate family, and for estate transfers within the family. \n \n The act would separately require all states to update all prohibited persons into the NCIC database, and it suggests financially punishing states that refuse to comply. Finally, the act would rewrite some definitions on mental health and drug use firearm prohibitions.\n \n The punishment for a violation is linked to 18 U.S.C. 924(A)(5), which sets forth a punishment of imprisonment of up to one year.",

Here's a run down of some of the members that have at one time or another served as members of Bloomberg's motley crew.\n \n Mayors Against Illegal Guns - Conservapedia\n \n We have former members who were advocates of gun control, who have been charged and sentenced on felony charges including assault, child pornography, child sexual assault, obstruction of justice, money laundering, bribery, sale of body parts, money laundering, theft, perjury, misappropriation of funds, murder, fabrication of evidence, etc.\n \n We have current members who are currently involved in various scandals, including one New York mayor who's been accused of arranging the illegal purchase of 52 machine guns, Ray Nagin who gave the confiscation order in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and another mayor who's jurisdiction has been plagued with seized guns going missing from the police department evidence lockup.\n \n And then there are at least 12 mayors who have resigned because they were either misled about the purpose of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, or were added to the lineup without their consent or knowledge.\n \n This hardly sounds like the most upstanding, honest group of people who should be lobbying congress for new gun control laws, or in a position of making up their own.\n \n It's also ironic that this supposed poll just happens to coincide with the release of Schumer's new bill. Complicating matters is the divide between urban and rural dwellers each supporting different standards, with the urbanites more likely to be interviewed and polled even if they're of a smaller makeup in comparison to the rest of the state.\n \n The poll not only lacks figures regarding the diversity of the group that was questioned, it doesn't mention how many people were surveyed for their opinions.",

They allowed hundreds of purchases to be made by flagged individuals and took no steps to even alert Mexican authorities to this Fast and Furious program. They conspired to flood Mexico with illegally acquired weaponry simply because it would give them an opportunity to justify their budget expenditures If the system isn't going to be used correctly then it shouldn't be used at all.\n \n Also I believe background checks regarding private and secondhand purchases would be in direct violation of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The act dictates that the practical utility of the possible information that can be gathered by the increase in paperwork outweighs the burden that its collection would put on the public. And since we're paying all the bills the burden would be quite extensive. The act also requires federal agencies to consult the Office of Management and Budget before they can implement any new paperwork requirements that apply to the public.\n \n And considering how rarely the ATF actually conducts an audit of licensed firearms dealers and how all records are hard copies on continually fading paper I see no legitimate benefit provided by these record keeping requirements.

   "It's an interesting question. Maybe the vast majority of gun owners aren't as opposed to \n reasonable regulations as the frothing fanatics suggest?\n\n \n I have to admit that I have a problem with some of the proposals. For example, the one about requiring gun dealers to notify the police if somebody fails a background check. First, the NICS people know when somebody fails...they make the determination. Second, the only reason that you would bother notifying the police is if you think there is some possibility that the person will be charged with trying to illegally obtain a gun. \n \n The problem I see with this is that for a prohibited person to be charged with trying to purchase the gun, they would have to KNOW they are prohibited, and I think it is a pretty good stretch of the imagination to think that somebody who KNOWS they are prohibited is going to fill out the paperwork to be checked. \n \n The other problem I see with this is that the majority of NICS failures are either mistakes or end up being unexplained. I have been turned down for firearms purchases twice. Neither time were they able to tell me WHY. The first time the dealer just called back the next day, had then check me again, and it came back approved in less than 3 minutes. The second time I was turned down it was at a gun show, on the last day, so they could not run it again, but I did contact NICS to see WHY I was turned down and they ended up sending me a letter that said they were unable to determine why my purchase was not approved. \n \n So you are essentially putting extra requirements on gun sellers, and setting up people to be harassed by the police, when the majority of the time the failure to get an approval is not legitimate.\n \n IMO anything that includes more purchase point background checks is a complete and utter waste of time. We have been there, done that, and it is an expensive failure. It is a pain the backside for gun purchasers, owners, and sellers, and it is absolutely worthless when it comes to controlling crime. It has no crime control component AT ALL. \n \n The same goes for registering firearms. There have been different registration schemes carried out by different cities and states and all of them have been expensive failures. Canada's nationwide registration has pretty much shown us that doing it on a bigger level does not improve the outcome, it just makes it a bigger failure.\n \n IMO we need to look at licensing PEOPLE, not firearms. IMO we need to issue firearms qualification cards to people...or even put the qualification on their drivers license like an organ donor stamp. It should be a 5 minute, or less, process, and it should just check the NICS system data (to see if you are a prohibited person or not). I would even go so far as to say we should make it a check box on your drivers license renewal form \"Do you want to be checked for firearms eligibility\" OR, even better yet, \"Check here to opt out of being checked for firearms eligibility\". \n \n Then, if information is later entered into NICS that indicates a person has become ineligible, they should get a letter explaining this and give them 30 days to appeal it. IF they dont appeal, or appeal and lose, they have to turn in their eligibility card, or their drivers license that shows they are eligible, and get a new license without the firearms stamp.\n \n People who do not have eligibility approvals go to prison if they are caught with a gun. For the REST of us, no more stupid background checks, no more dumb restrictions. Buying a gun would be as simple as walking into a gun store, showing your drivers license or eligibility card, and tossing cash on the counter. No paperwork or BS. \n \n Since this would give law enforcement the tools to actually arrest ineligible gun owners, we could do away with the NFA, so for those of us who ARE eligible, all the machine guns, short barrel shotguns, and silencers you can possibly want. After all, your eligibility card establishes that you are not a criminal or a prohibited person, so there is no point in having to fill out a bunch of extra paperwork to establish what your card already establishes. \n \n Now, obviously there would have to be some kind of mechanism for children (like...you can get your eligibility card at age 10) or even an amnesty for children. Likewise there would need to be some kind of system in place for people to regain their rights. Under the current system, you lose your cool and smack your wife once 20 years ago, and you can not own a firearm. That is insane and needs to be addressed. Even felons should be able to petition for the return of their rights. \n \n As long as the system is BROAD...aimed at getting ALL eligible people enrolled, I can not really think of any down side to such a system.",

   "With all due respect Daewoo I can't really support your notion of a firearms qualification card and arresting people who have a gun but not said card in their possession or to their name. Any program that would allow the government to freely and arbitrarily determine that someone is either \"qualified\" or \"unqualified\" to own a gun without sufficient due process and a standard of review to safeguard the people against unjust accusations is simply too much of a danger to the American people and should never be allowed to come into existence to begin with.\n \n The conditions on which a person is judged as either \"qualified\" or \"unqualified\" might be simple and come down to a matter of felony conviction at first. But the way politicians and bureaucrats are it would only be a matter of time before the determination is expanded to the point that becoming \"unqualified\" include misdemeanor convictions, or the existence of sealed juvenile records.

   "With all due respect Daewoo I can't really support your notion of a firearms qualification card and arresting people who have a gun but not said card in their possession or to their name. Any program that would allow the government to freely and arbitrarily determine that someone is either \"qualified\" or \"unqualified\" to own a gun without sufficient due process and a standard of review to safeguard the people against unjust accusations is simply too much of a danger to the American people and should never be allowed to come into existence to begin with.\n \n The conditions on which a person is judged as either \"qualified\" or \"unqualified\" might be simple and come down to a matter of felony conviction at first. But the way politicians and bureaucrats are it would only be a matter of time before the determination is expanded to the point that becoming \"unqualified\" include misdemeanor convictions, or the existence of sealed juvenile records. Or worse it could become as big a nightmare as the no fly list where even if someone is unjustly included on the list it could be impossible to actually get off the list. One need look no further than Chicago and Washington DC to see what kind of mockery the cities have implemented for determining who's \"qualified\" and \"unqualified\" for gun ownership.\n\n \n Uh.....we already have that. Sections 922(g) and (n) list prohibited persons when it comes to firearms purchases. The following persons are prohibited from owning a firearm:\n \n \n * Has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\n * Is under indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\n * Is a fugitive from justice\n * Is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance\n * Has been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution\n * Is illegally or unlawfully in the United States\n * Has been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions\n * Having been a citizen of the United States, has renounced U.S. citizenship\n * Is subject to a court order that restrains the person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child of such intimate partner\n * Has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\n \n\n \n Currently, if you fit any of the above and own a gun, you are committing a crime. \n \n My plan would not change that list and would not make adding to it or subtracting from it any more difficult than it is today. It would not criminalize any behavior that is not already against the law. It would not make it any easier to criminalize other behavior. \n \n What it would do is allow you to pull out your drivers license and show a gun store clerk that you are not a prohibited person so they can sell you a gun without a background check with paperwork attached. \n \n It would also make it easier to prosecute people who are prohibited from owning firearms but have them anyway. Currently it can be difficult to prosecute prohibited people who have firearms in their possession because often people do not know that they ARE a prohibited person.",

   "Just trying to think out loud how this law is supposed to benefit law enforcement if passed....the proposed legislation requires dealers (and LE agencies) who handle the background checks for these secondary sales to complete a form (yet to be devised) similar to the current FFL sale forms that would record the identification of the seller and the purchaser. Unlike initial sales, however, the law requires these secondary sales to be automatically reported to the Attorney General-absent any identification of who the seller or buyer is. Apparently, the record would only be of the date of sale, the FFL dealer/LE agency who made it possible, and would only list the make/model/serial number of the firearm-the identification of the seller and purchaser would be kept by the local dealer/LE agency much like current FFL dealer transaction forms are kept. This would create a national registration of all secondary sales by firearm serial number. Presumably, this would allow LE who recovers a gun (and wants to know who legally had it last) to contact ATF with the serial number, and then ATF could contact the dealer/LE agency which handled the last sale and could provide the information identifying the last seller and purchaser. However, I don't really see how helpful this information would be. Now if you actually found someone in possession of a firearm then it would be relatively easy to determine whether they obtained the firearm without following the background check law's requirements by contacting the AG, giving the serial number, and having the ATF pull the local dealer's or LE agency's transaction form for the last \"lawful\" sale. This of course allows you to prosecute otherwise peaceful and lawful gun owners who-although they could lawfully have the gun-did not go through the process of proving they could lawfully have the gun before they bought it. But if there is a benefit to society for prosecuting people for having property which the law says they can legally possess merely because they did not fill out some paperwork then I don't see it. The law certainly does not seemed aimed at helping prosecute those found in possession who are already disqualified (felons, etc.)-we don't need this new law to help do that.\n \n So it looks to me like the main thrust of the legislation is aimed at the seller. It looks like an attempt to modify the felony criminal liability for selling to someone he knew or should have known was disqualified from having a gun by including a much broader misdemeanor crime to sell to someone, even someone who could legally buy the gun, without a background check. \n \n However, the legislation still makes it illegal to possess a firearm that you acquired without having undergone a background check. An initial concern I see with this part of the legislation is that it would turn every gun owner into a suspect. Every traffic stop or other law enforcement/citizen encounter in which law enforcement learns that the citizen possesses a firearm would now allow for suspicion that the firearm may have been obtained without going through the background check process. The only way to easily and readily dispel this suspicion of not having illegally obtained a firearm would be by a universal requirement on the part of the gun owner to carry some sort of documentation stating how you came to possess the firearm without violating the background check law. Could this be the next Schumer proposal if this law were passed? Universal registration of every firearm you have? Or something like a time limited universal firearm owner's \"permit\" issued after you line up for you background check? The law already appears to strongly encourage states to have \"firearm permit\" laws. It would be one way for a state to avoid the penalty of withheld federal funding, and if your state has a \"permit\" law, then once you get your permit you can buy a gun from your neighbor at his house by showing him your \"permit\" rather than having both of you go to a dealer, pay a fee, and have him handle the sale. Of course, under the current proposal states with these \"permit\" laws allow the secondary seller and buyer to transfer the firearm without any reporting to the AG-which defeats the apparent goal of making it easier for LE to trace secondary sales. \n \n Finally, any person caught with a firearm that was initially sold before the law took effect would be very difficult to prosecute for having obtained it on the secondary market without a background check in violation of the new law. There is no requirement (right now, at least) for persons who have already obtained firearms on the secondary market to register them. In this circumstance how would LE prove that the person found with the older model gun did not buy it on the secondary market before the law was passed requiring a background check? In my opinion it would require a later call for the need to close this \"loophole\" by establishing a nationwide universal and constantly updated registration system for all firearms in your possession to make enforcement of Schumer's current proposal feasible. \n \n Sinjin, I saw the article in the Times Dispatch. That led me to look for the proposed legislation. I wondered a bit at the survey methodology. Thanks for the link to the survey. Here are some issues I have with the survey.... \n \n Why ask a question that implies law enforcement is unaware of background check denials because gun dealers are not reporting it? The reality is the information flows in the exact opposite direction. 18 U.S.C. 922 requires law enforcement to not only know of but approve/disprove the sale-and it is law enforcement that reports the disproved sale to the dealer before he makes the transaction. Did the survey team not understand this, or did they know about it and believe there was a legitimate reason to conceal this reality from those who were surveyed? For example, did the survey team, either willingly or unknowingly, conceal from the Virginians they polled the fact that the Virginia State Police already manages the instant check system, that dealers submit the information to the VSP, that the VSP approves/denies the sale, that the VSP notifies the dealer if a sale is denied, that the dealer is not even told of the reason for a denial, and that as soon as a potential buyer is denied a local state trooper is dispatched immediately to the store to conduct an investigation? (One reason, by the way, for not telling the dealer why the sale was not approved is to make the potential buyer wonder why he was denied so he will be more likely to ask questions and linger at the store until the trooper can arrive) If the survey team did not know this was the case, then why didn't they learn about how the current system works before they asked a question that falsely implies the system has a loophole that hides potential gun crimes from law enforcement? If they did know about the current system, then why ask a question that intentionally misleads people to believe such a loophole exists? I see no excuse for a misleading question caused by lack of knowledge, and I see no justification for an attempt to intentionally mislead those being questioned. While we are on the subject of \"loopholes,\" The \"gun show\" question seems to suggest a majority favor \"require sellers at gun shows to run background checks.\" Did the survey team tell the Virginians they surveyed that all dealer sales at gun shows require background checks, or were they willing to allow those who did not know better to answer the question under the possible mistaken belief that gun shows were completely unregulated? Did they also conceal from those surveyed that the Attorney General already has the power to order FFL dealers to report \"bulk\" (or even single) sales of \"assault weapons\"? \n \n Here is another question I have: Assume for a moment that the survey team calls me and asks my opinion of whether we should \"do more to keep guns out the hands of bad people,\" and assume I responded \"I don't know what the current laws are could you explain them to me before I answer the question.\" Based upon the misleading nature of the questions I have already seen asked, do you think I would have gotten either a knowing or honest answer from the survey team to ensure I gave them an informed opinion in response? \n \n Looking again at the Mayors' site you linked, I find it technically correct but intellectually dishonest to claim support by a \"plurality\" of people in VA and AZ whom they say \"feel\" their states have done \"too little\" since the Tucson/Va Tech shootings. Assuming (without much confidence) that their questions generated informed responses, their data for VA shows 38 percent say too little, 38 percent say too much/right amount and 24 percent say they don't know. Their Arizona data shows 42 percent say too little, 45 percent say too much/right amount, and 13 percent say don't know. A more honest analysis of this data is an even split of those surveyed in VA between needing/not needing more legislation, and a slim majority in AZ who say there is either too much or the right amount gun control legislation already-all from a survey method that is concealing from those surveyed the reality of how current gun regulations really work. \n \n And this is a major credibility issue for me. Consider this example: Assume I conducted a poll here and asked everyone to tell me whether in their opinion the juries in trials I prosecuted over the last year gave out too much/the right amount/or not enough time for the crimes people were found guilty of. Would the opinion poll be worth anything if those answering had no idea what the crimes or the sentences were? The poll would be worthless. And so in looking at the poll conducted for the Mayors, how can I accept the validity of an opinion poll that asks me to assume it is the result of informed opinion when the questions themselves conceal the true nature of the facts the opinions should be based upon?",
