   "Here's an opinion from Luis T Puig that reminds us that those who refuse to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. And that is precisely what is occurring in our great Nation as we forsake what is right and normal for that which is unnatural and an abomination. \n Luis T. Puig\n What do I mean by that? \n \n Well, like many civilizations in the sad history of this world, our nation is suffering from the moral degradation and immorality attacks, which is killing it little by little. And since it is such a gradual change for the worse, most people are unaware of how far down the hill we have gone! This is the slow reaction/sensing principle which in biology is called \"The Frog and the Pot of hot water\" experiment. \n When a frog was dropped into a pan filled with boiling water, it jumped right out. Naturally! Who could bear to stay in that atmosphere?\n But when the frog was in the water, and the flame was slowly turned up, the frog didn't jump out. It kept trying to accommodate and accommodate to the change in temperature, and it slowly boiled to death.\n And that is what has been happening in our country. Liberals and XXXXXX (is there a difference?) have been slowly but surely, very deliberately making small changes to what are the \"norms\" in our nation now for the past decades, specially since the 1960's. And today, if we look back at what was moral and immoral back them we would see that we are miles away from where we were.\n What really has me upset is the anything goes attitudes of today's people, the \"who cares the consequences and let's do it\" liberal philosophy. And then not just the shoving down everyone throat homosexuality and their sick lifestyle, but also having to accommodate them. \n The ancient Greeks, the Romans, the Carthaginians, and many other great civilizations did not collapse due to an invasion of their enemies from outside, but collapse due to the thousand of little immoralities and irresponsible acts by many of their citizens, or the \"Death of a Thousand Cuts, \"little things\" that all together consumed those civilizations and brought about their demise. \n And I am afraid we are on the same path to oblivion. \n We better reverse course of our great nation will become one more entry in the sad statistical history of failed civilizations due to the immorality of its citizens.\n I wrote a book about one of the \"cuts\" afflicting the United States today but also the western world, the current leftist drive for acceptance of homosexuality, and why it is a dysfunction that not only needs not be accepted, but treated since it is a sickness that is one of the factors killing the normality and morality of our nation.\n The book is \"What Nature Intended, Six Factors Demonstrating Homosexuality to be a Dysfunction\". \n What Nature Intended: (Six Factors Demonstrating Homosexuality to be a Dysfunction)\n I wrote it because I am sick and tired of the liberals and the special interest groups like the homosexuals pushing their sick agendas on society and getting away with it. I want my son to grow up in a nation that will still resemble the normal and moral nation I loved so much in my youth.\n I used my two decades of nuclear analytical experience and training into collection all the data and doing the scientific analysis of what is really homosexuality, it is love or just sex? Is it normal or abnormal, according to the Laws of Reproduction and nature? Is it a genetic or \"learned\" behavior? And I found the answers. It is a mental disease. \n So, to all of you that feel the same way, use the scientific facts and analysis I give you in that work and fight against the gay mafia that is corrupting our country before it is too late.\n And do not underestimate the forces against morality in this country; they are powerful and conniving forces. But together, holding on to our Morals and Convictions we can defeat the immoral pestilence that is trying to turn us into one of those failed civilizations of history.\n Don't let it happen!\n Luis T. Puig\n Just imagine if by some curse on humanity every single person on earth became homosexual overnight. Within the single life span of the remaining people alive on earth, human life would cease to exist on our planet. That fact alone is overwhelming evidence that homosexuality is an unnatural sexual proclivity. And the argument that will undoubtably follow that science could artificially produce life through insemination is further evidence that the defenders of homosexuality understand clearly that in order for it to survive, unnatural procedures are required.\n \n So you should be crying JJ, but not tears of joy. You should be crying for the country you claim to love but is slowly dying as your homosexual community is contributing to its inevitable destruction with every moral decline you add to America's list of degenerate contributions to this worlds modern pop culture.",

I do find it disturbing that it took this long to do it. I also find it disturbing that we still have no law in place preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation at the federal level.

They (for the most part) work together as a ruling aristocracy to protect their common interests at the expense of the rest of America.

David Lapan.\n \n But Lapan said those dismissals had been approved before October 21, when Gates tightened the rules about who in the Pentagon can dismiss a service member for violating the policy. Now, only the civilian service secretaries, in consultation with the Pentagon's top lawyer and head of personnel, can order dismissals. No new cases have resulted in dismissals since then.\n \n Gates also said he now endorses all the recommendations of the Pentagon's working group on \"don't ask, don't tell\" as the road map for implementation. There will be no special bathroom or housing facilities to accommodate homosexuals, except in special cases. And troops who oppose serving with homosexuals will not be allowed to quit the military before their commitment is up.\n\n \n It could be a very long time before the repeal is official.

   "If you take notice, I never said \"another course of action would have far more favorable results\". I'm not looking back and saying what we should have done, I am simply looking back at the carnage we have left in our wake. Something that sadly most Americans refuse to do. It is hard to learn from the mistakes of our past if we refuse to first recognize those mistakes.\n \n \n So you just say you should not have done that and then move on? With no idea as to what result should have occurred how do say what was wrong?\n \n You can't have one and not the other and actually voicing what you think should have happened isn't necessary. You do that when you point out what was done wrong.\n \n I agree 100% there is much of history that does not need repeating, nor does potentially new history need to be written about things that could have been different, but weren't. The point I was making is clearly shown in your post. The focus is about what we as a nation and then broken into groups does wrong. Even when something is acknowledged there is a but followed by either a shift to another fault or to undermine the praise just given.\n \n \n \nAdd to those money, wealth, potential, power, influence, and raw desire and you have a pretty good start on the list. \n \n\n \n With these things come the obligation to rid the world of evil, help old ladies across the street and jump through hoops to achieve what is expected of us?\n \n Germany, Japan, China, France, Italy, Brazil, Russia, UK, Canada or Spain are the 10 richest nations after the US (not in order) is their participation in world events comparably proportionate to their ranking? Do they receive similar treatment for their involvement? \n \n Nope \n \n \n\"We must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent nor omniscient--that we cannot impose our will upon the other 94% of mankind--that we cannot right every wrong or reverse every adversity--and that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.\" -John F. Kennedy, Nov 16, 1961\n\n \n He just said what I am saying better.\n \n \n \nHe got shot in the head. Many would argue that his above stated belief was directly in the center of why. \n\n \n Isn't this roughly what I said? The US doesn't have all the answers, we are just the same dumb animals trying to figure out how to make it to next week like everybody else \n \n \n \n \nSo that justifies it huh? Would stealing a car be justified if you later used it to drive a sick person to the hospital? \n\n \n All you had to do was include the next sentence instead of breaking it where you did and you would not have needed to ask the silly question, but since you did would you let the sick person die instead of taking the car?\n \n \nAnd don't forget, the US led the way when it came to nuclear weapons. We were the first to test them, the only nation to use them, and still to this day maintain the second highest (disclosed) stockpile of active warheads. Imagine how many we have the are \"undisclosed\". \n\n \n First example the US did bad and and still is. No mention about how we continue to diminish ours and others arsenals the money, concessions and benefits we give to other nuclear nations to keep them from popping one off just to see. What is important is the US led the world to a nuke race and wink wink we lie about how many we really have. \n \n Does it really matter if someone doesn't know we really have 2000 50 megaton ICBMs instead if 1500?\n \n \nSure we can say good job. It's great that the US is finally a nation where homosexuals will be allowed to serve their country without the need to hide a part of their identity. I applaud this. I do find it disturbing that it took this long to do it. I also find it disturbing that we still have no law in place preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation at the federal level. Sure we can take a minute to reflect on a job well done, but then it's time to pick up the yoke and drive on...there is still much work to be done. \n\n \n Example 2 Sure I can BUT and then don't forget let's diminish the achievement with another BUT\n \n Would it have killed you to maybe just put them in different sentences?\n \n Nobody is saying anything about ok we are done.\n \n Have you ever been in a friendship or relationship with someone who just found fault with the everything? After awhile your attitude just becomes why bother\n \n \nGreat...so instead of it being rich white men against everyone else, now it is simply the rich against the poor. Take a good look at Wall St., big oil, big business, politicians, and the majority of the wealth in this nation. They (for the most part) work together as a ruling aristocracy to protect their common interests at the expense of the rest of America. It is a plain example of class warfare, and it is going to destroy our nation. We still have all the tenets of discrimination, slavery, and segregation in this country...we have just applied them to new victims. \n\n \n Here is our third example. When prejudice and social inequality don't work out lets move to class and economic inequality. \n \n I would also like for roughly 3-4 billion people to come to the same conclusion on a wide variety of steps to necessary to make all our lives much better. The whole world doesn't need to agree just a little more than half. Mind you we have a hard time agreeing what to watch on TV, but I would like to think one day that number will be met.\n \n \n \nThink of how dumb the average person is, and then realize that 50% of them are dumber than that. -I think George Carlin said that. \n\n \n Funny man, I love his impression of a cat.\n \n \nRegardless, I don't think it really matters any more. Money controls this nations destiny. What does it say to you that the 20-40% of those who do participate in the government (meaning those who vote, those who do make it a point to understand the issues and/or hold their representatives accountable to represent them) elect XXXXXX like Bush and Obama? It tells me that this nation needs a big slap across the face...and I think it is coming.\n\n \n I think they are fighting a battle they are losing in which people find it easier to sit on the sidelines waiting for the hero to trip and fall so they can shake their heads and say see I told you so.",

You deny that Jesus Christ was an actual historical figure now? I suppose that everything written about Him by so many different people was just a mass delusion, right? What I marvel at is that you deniers of truth aren't even embarrassed at the ignorance it requires to choose to believe as you do. That the world changed so much, never to be the same because of the existence of this single person is completely lost on you and is the most solid evidence of His existence in reality.\n \n \nOh..

It is, by all accounts, hearsay. I do not know what Jesus would do or say and neither do you. To suggest otherwise is foolish.\n\n \n Actually, and I realize it's completely beyond you to appreciate, but the bible is itself all of the evidence of Gods character and His values that we need. If you understood the bible or real history on the most rudimentary level, you would know that it is Gods handbook written for humanity as our moral and spiritual guide, so it is self evident in its importance which explains why it has survived the millennia in spite of the untold number of attempts to destroy it and neutralize its impact on humanity by people of your character since its very beginning.\n \n \nHow am I a liar or a self-indulgent hypocrite? Your post only proves, once again, that you have no idea who I am and, once again, I will ask that you not make any assumptions about my person or my values. \n\n \n My post proves that I know your spiritual condition better than you know yourself. You are so steeped in ignorance of who and what you are as a child of God that you not only denigrate His handiwork, but you proudly lower yourself to the level of an animal. \n \n You Christ deniers are so insulted when we call you what you are that it is completely lost on you that it is you who is lowering yourselves as you lie about Him and deny you were created in His image, for fellowship. That makes you a liar and a hypocrite just as I described you.\n \n \n My lack of belief makes me no worse or better than you. Just as your faith in God doesn't make you any better a person than myself or anyone else.\n\n \n I realize that as a leftist and an atheist, class equality is very important to you but I never said I was better than you as a human being. That is your flawed interpretation since your ilk never hears what we actually say. God is NOT a respecter of men so my pointing out your spiritual flaws in no way suggests that I am superior to you in any way. Remember, it is by faith that I am saved by Gods grace so no sense of superiority exists within me.\n \n [QUOTE]I have no intention of mocking your religion. I will, however, feel free to mock those that readily insult me without cause as you did when you called me a liar and self-indulgent hypocrite.\n \n \nI hope you and your family are safe and merry during the holidays.\n\n \n So far, so good, and the same to you and yours...\n \n \nI think Jesus would have told you to stop dragging His name through the muck... and being a horrible example of a follower of His teachings...\n\n \n What i find hilarious is that if you were the christian you claim to be you would agree with me in all areas of my belief system.
