   "I believe that there is suficient controversy over the meaning of this opinion to devote a thread to debating it. Here is the opinion:\n \n MCREYNOLDS, J., Opinion of the Court \n \n SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n 307 U.S. 174 \n \n United States v. Miller\n APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n No. 696 Argued: March 30, 1939 --- Decided: May 15, 1939 \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n \n An indictment in the District Court, Western District Arkansas, charged that Jack Miller and Frank Layton\n \n did unlawfully, knowingly, willfully, and feloniously transport in interstate commerce from the town of Claremore in the State of Oklahoma to the town of Siloam Springs in the State of Arkansas a certain firearm, to-wit, a double barrel 12-gauge Stevens shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches in length, bearing identification number 76230, said defendants, at the time of so transporting said firearm in interstate commerce as aforesaid, not having registered said firearm as required by Section 1132d of Title 26, United States Code (Act of June 26, 1934, c. 737, Sec. 4 [\u00a7 5], 48 Stat. 1237), and not having in their possession a stamp-affixed written order for said firearm as provided by Section 1132c, Title 2, United States Code (June 26, 1934, c. 737, Sec. 4, 48 Stat. 1237) and the regulations issued under authority of the said Act of Congress known as the \"National Firearms Act,\" approved June 26, 1934, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the United States. [n1] [p176] \n \n A duly interposed demurrer alleged: the National Firearms Act is not a revenue measure, but an attempt to usurp police power reserved to the States, and is therefore unconstitutional. Also, it offends the inhibition of the Second Amendment to the Constitution -- \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" [p177] \n \n The District Court held that section eleven of the Act violates the Second Amendment. It accordingly sustained the demurrer and quashed the indictment.\n \n The cause is here by direct appeal.\n \n Considering Sonzinsky v. United States (1937), 300 U.S. 506, 513, and what was ruled in sundry causes arising [p178] under the Harrison Narcotic Act [n2] -- United States v. Jin Fuey Moy (1916), 241 U.S. 394, United States v. Doremus (1919), 249 U.S. 86, 94; Linder v. United States (1925), 268 U.S. 5; Alston v. United States (1927), 274 U.S. 289; Nigro v. United States (1928), 276 U.S. 332 -- the objection that the Act usurps police power reserved to the States is plainly untenable.\n \n In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a \"shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length\" at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment, or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State, 2 Humphreys (Tenn.) 154, 158.\n \n The Constitution, as originally adopted, granted to the Congress power --\n \n To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\n \n With obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such forces, the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment were made. It must be interpreted and applied with that end in view.\n \n The Militia which the States were expected to maintain and train is set in contrast with Troops which they [p179] were forbidden to keep without the consent of Congress. The sentiment of the time strongly disfavored standing armies; the common view was that adequate defense of country and laws could be secured through the Militia -- civilians primarily, soldiers on occasion.\n \n The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. \"A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.\" And further, that ordinarily, when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\n \n Blackstone's Commentaries, Vol. 2, Ch. 13, p. 409 points out \"that king Alfred first settled a national militia in this kingdom,\" and traces the subsequent development and use of such forces.\n \n Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. 1, contains an extended account of the Militia. It is there said: \"Men of republican principles have been jealous of a standing army as dangerous to liberty.\"\n \n In a militia, the character of the labourer, artificer, or tradesman, predominates over that of the soldier: in a standing army, that of the soldier predominates over every other character, and in this distinction seems to consist the essential difference between those two different species of military force.\n \n \"The American Colonies In The 17th Century,\" Osgood, Vol. 1, ch. XIII, affirms in reference to the early system of defense in New England --\n \n In all the colonies, as in England, the militia system was based on the principle of the assize of arms. This implied the general obligation of all adult male inhabitants to possess arms, and, with certain exceptions, to [p180] cooperate in the work of defence.\n \n The possession of arms also implied the possession of ammunition, and the authorities paid quite as much attention to the latter as to the former.\n \n A year later [1632] it was ordered that any single man who had not furnished himself with arms might be put out to service, and this became a permanent part of the legislation of the colony [Massachusetts].\n \n Also,\n \n Clauses intended to insure the possession of arms and ammunition by all who were subject to military service appear in all the important enactments concerning military affairs. Fines were the penalty for delinquency, whether of towns or individuals. According to the usage of the times, the infantry of Massachusetts consisted of pikemen and musketeers. The law, as enacted in 1649 and thereafter, provided that each of the former should be armed with a pike, corselet, head-piece, sword, and knapsack. The musketeer should carry a \"good fixed musket,\" not under bastard musket bore, not less than three feet, nine inches, nor more than four feet three inches in length, a priming wire, scourer, and mould, a sword, rest, bandoleers, one pound of powder, twenty bullets, and two fathoms of match. The law also required that two-thirds of each company should be musketeers.\n \n The General Court of Massachusetts, January Session 1784, provided for the organization and government of the Militia. It directed that the Train Band should \"contain all able bodied men, from sixteen to forty years of age, and the Alarm List, all other men under sixty years of age, . . .\" Also,\n \n That every noncommissioned officer and private soldier of the said militia not under the controul of parents, masters or guardians, and being of sufficient ability therefor in the judgment of the Selectmen of the town in which he shall dwell, shall equip himself, and be constantly provided with a good fire arm,\n \n etc.\n \n By an Act passed April 4, 1786, the New York Legislature directed:\n \n That every able-bodied Male Person, being [p181] a Citizen of this State, or of any of the United States, and residing in this State, (except such Persons as are hereinafter excepted) and who are of the Age of Sixteen, and under the Age of Forty-five Years, shall, by the Captain or commanding Officer of the Beat in which such Citizens shall reside, within four Months after the passing of this Act, be enrolled in the Company of such Beat. . . . That every Citizen so enrolled and notified shall, within three Months thereafter, provide himself, at his own Expense, with a good Musket or Firelock, a sufficient Bayonet and Belt, a Pouch with a Box therein to contain not less than Twenty-four Cartridges suited to the Bore of his Musket or Firelock, each Cartridge containing a proper Quantity of Powder and Ball, two spare Flints, a Blanket and Knapsack; . . .\n \n The General Assembly of Virginia, October, 1785, (12 Hening's Statutes) declared,\n \n The defense and safety of the commonwealth depend upon having its citizens properly armed and taught the knowledge of military duty.\n \n It further provided for organization and control of the Militia, and directed that \"All free male persons between the ages of eighteen and fifty years,\" with certain exceptions, \"shall be inrolled or formed into companies.\" \"There shall be a private muster of every company once in two months.\"\n \n Also that\n \n Every officer and soldier shall appear at his respective muster-field on the day appointed, by eleven o'clock in the forenoon, armed, equipped, and accoutred, as follows: . . . every non-commissioned officer and private with a good, clean musket carrying an ounce ball, and three feet eight inches long in the barrel, with a good bayonet and iron ramrod well fitted thereto, a cartridge box properly made, to contain and secure twenty cartridges fitted to his musket, a good knapsack and canteen, and moreover, each non-commissioned officer and private shall have at every muster one pound of good [p182] powder, and four pounds of lead, including twenty blind cartridges, and each serjeant shall have a pair of moulds fit to cast balls for their respective companies, to be purchased by the commanding officer out of the monies arising on delinquencies. Provided, That the militia of the counties westward of the Blue Ridge, and the counties below adjoining thereto, shall not be obliged to be armed with muskets, but may have good rifles with proper accoutrements, in lieu thereof. And every of the said officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates, shall constantly keep the aforesaid arms, accoutrements, and ammunition ready to be produced whenever called for by his commanding officer. If any private shall make it appear to the satisfaction of the court hereafter to be appointed for trying delinquencies under this act that he is so poor that he cannot purchase the arms herein required, such court shall cause them to be purchased out of the money arising from delinquents.\n \n Most if not all of the States have adopted provisions touching the right to keep and bear arms. Differences in the language employed in these have naturally led to somewhat variant conclusions concerning the scope of the right guaranteed. But none of them seems to afford any material support for the challenged ruling of the court below. \n \n In the margin, some of the more important opinions and comments by writers are cited. [n3] \n \n We are unable to accept the conclusion of the court below, and the challenged judgment must be reversed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings.\n \n MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause.\n \n 1. Act of June 26, 1934, c. 757, 48 Stat. 1236-1240, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132.\n \n That for the purposes of this Act --\n \n (a) The term \"firearm\" means a shotgun or rifle having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length, or any other weapon, except a pistol or revolver, from which a shot is discharged by an explosive if such weapon is capable of being concealed on the person, or a machine gun, and includes a muffler or silencer for any firearm whether or not such firearm is included within the foregoing definition [The Act of April 10, 1936, c. 169, 49 Stat. 1192 added the words], but does not include any rifle which is within the foregoing provisions solely by reason of the length of its barrel if the caliber of such rifle is .22 or smaller and if its barrel is sixteen inches or more in length.\n \n Sec. 3. (a) There shall be levied, collected, and paid upon firearms transferred in the continental United States a tax at the rate of $200 for each firearm, such tax to be paid by the transferor, and to be represented by appropriate stamps to be provided by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary, and the stamps herein provided shall be affixed to the order for such firearm, hereinafter provided for. The tax imposed by this section shall be in addition to any import duty imposed on such firearm.\n \n Sec. 4. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person to transfer a firearm except in pursuance of a written order from the person seeking to obtain such article, on an application form issued in blank in duplicate for that purpose by the Commissioner. Such order shall identify the applicant by such means of identification as may be prescribed by regulations under this Act: Provided, That, if the applicant is an individual, such identification shall include fingerprints and a photograph thereof.\n \n (c) Every person so transferring a firearm shall set forth in each copy of such order the manufacturer's number or other mark identifying such firearm, and shall forward a copy of such order to the Commissioner. The original thereof, with stamps affixed, shall be returned to the applicant.\n \n (d) No person shall transfer a firearm which has previously been transferred on or after the effective date of this Act, unless such person, in addition to complying with subsection (c), transfers therewith the stamp-affixed order provided for in this section for each such prior transfer, in compliance with such regulations as may be prescribed under this Act for proof of payment of all taxes on such firearms.\n \n Sec. 5. (a) Within sixty days after the effective date of this Act every person possessing a firearm shall register, with the collector of the district in which he resides, the number or other mark identifying such firearm, together with his name, address, place where such firearm is usually kept, and place of business or employment, and, if such person is other than a natural person, the name and home address of an executive officer thereof: Provided, That no person shall be required to register under this section with respect to any firearm acquired after the effective date of, and in conformity with the provisions of, this Act.\n \n Sec. 6. It shall be unlawful for any person to receive or possess any firearm which has at any time been transferred in violation of section 3 or 4 of this Act.\n \n Sec. 11. It shall be unlawful for any person who is required to register as provided in section 5 hereof and who shall not have so registered, or any other person who has not in his possession a stamp-affixed order as provided in section 4 hereof, to ship, carry, or deliver any firearm in interstate commerce.\n \n Sec. 12. The Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary, shall prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary for carrying the provisions of this Act into effect.\n \n Sec. 14. Any person who violates or fails to comply with any of the requirements of this Act shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $2,000 or be imprisoned for not more than five years, or both, in the discretion of the court.\n \n Sec. 16. If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of the Act, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.\n \n Sec. 18. This Act may be cited as the \"National Firearms Act.\"\n \n 2. Act December 17, 1914, c. 1, 38 Stat. 785; February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057.\n \n 3. Concerning The Militia -- Presser v.

   "I agree, but you won't get much discussion on the full text of the opinion from the other side. The gun-grabbers main arguments are that (supposedly) the history is unclear, the phrasing is ambiguous. and that the grammar is poor. Their game is to employ the smoke and mirrors routine rather than look at actual facts in context.\n \n We can find answers to questions that are supposedly unclear, ambiguous, or debatable straight from the Miller opinion as it provides an excellent, though brief, review of the history behind the amendment. \n \n \n \n Who are the militia?\n \n (This is anwered at length in the Miller opinion)\n \n \n \n Who would arm the militia? \n \n The Court provided examples to support their conclusion that \n \"when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\"\n \n From the NY militia legislation cited by the court:\n \"That every Citizen so enrolled and notified shall, within three Months thereafter, provide himself, at his own Expense, with a good Musket or Firelock, a sufficient Bayonet and Belt\",\n \n From the Mass. militia legislation cited by the court:\n \"That every noncommissioned officer and private soldier of the said militia not under the controul of parents, masters or guardians, and being of sufficient ability therefor in the judgment of the Selectmen of the town in which he shall dwell, shall equip himself, and be constantly provided with a good fire arm\"\n \n \n From the VA militia legislation cited by the court:\n \"Every officer and soldier shall appear at his respective muster-field on the day appointed, by eleven o'clock in the forenoon, armed, equipped, and accoutred, as follows: . . . every non-commissioned officer and private with a good, clean musket carrying an ounce ball, and three feet eight inches long in the barrel, with a good bayonet and iron ramrod well fitted thereto, a cartridge box properly made, to contain and secure twenty cartridges fitted to his musket, a good knapsack and canteen, and moreover, each non-commissioned officer and private shall have at every muster one pound of good [p182] powder, and four pounds of lead, including twenty blind cartridges, and each serjeant shall have a pair of moulds fit to cast balls for their respective companies, to be purchased by the commanding officer out of the monies arising on delinquencies. Provided, That the militia of the counties westward of the Blue Ridge, and the counties below adjoining thereto, shall not be obliged to be armed with muskets, but may have good rifles with proper accoutrements, in lieu thereof. And every of the said officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates, shall constantly keep the aforesaid arms, accoutrements, and ammunition ready to be produced whenever called for by his commanding officer. If any private shall make it appear to the satisfaction of the court hereafter to be appointed for trying delinquencies under this act that he is so poor that he cannot purchase the arms herein required, such court shall cause them to be purchased out of the money arising from delinquents.\"\n \n \n \n Did the framers expect that citizens would use arms for purposes other than militia duty?\n \n Yes, in the Court's words \"in common use at the time\", is supported by the VA militia act which allowed those west of the blue ridge to have rifles, which are better suited to hunting which was an important means of making a living in that area at that time. \n \n Again from the VA militia legislation cited by the court:\n \"That the militia of the counties westward of the Blue Ridge, and the counties below adjoining thereto, shall not be obliged to be armed with muskets, but may have good rifles with proper accoutrements, in lieu thereof.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  What is the meaning of the prefatory phrase?\n \n The Court wrote:\n With obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such forces, the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment were made. It must be interpreted and applied with that end in view.\n \n and, \n \n the common view was that adequate defense of country and laws could be secured through the Militia -- civilians primarily, soldiers on occasion.\n \n and,\n \n The General Assembly of Virginia, October, 1785, (12 Hening's Statutes) declared,\n \n \"The defense and safety of the commonwealth depend upon having its citizens properly armed and taught the knowledge of military duty.\"\n \n \n Note that this is in stark contrast to the claims of the Historians for DC and the Brady Bunch -both of them treat the prefatory language not as a \"declaration\" but as a conditional, and they claim that the only concern was to protect an \"institution\" such as the State Militia or National Guard, rather than to \"assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such forces\" -\"such forces\" being the militia as defined by the Supreme Court in Miller, not a select institution such as the National Guard.",

   "hans,\n \n The various militia acts cited by the Miller Court plainly show that the duty to keep arms included all men subject to military duty, not just those in the Train band, but those on the call list as well.\n \n So much for the idea of a well-regulated\" militia then.\n \n Somewhere I seem to remember that a very wise American once said that there are no rights without corresponding responsibilities.\n \n Seems to me that a bit of continuing military training is not an unreasonable requirement.\n \n Of course, if you really want an untrained rabble as the nation's last line of defense, I suppose that's your choice.\n\n \n Why stop there? If mandatory training to ensure the effective enjoyment of civil rights is the goal, then why not also require people to attend mandatory reading comprehension classes before they can buy a book? Why not include mandatory typing education classes as a requirement for exercising the freedom of speech through blogging? Why not require mandatory public speaking courses before allowing someone to petition their government for a redress of a grievance at a public city council meeting? Why not deny every person who chooses to represent themselves in a criminal case the ability to cross examine their accuser unless they first take a test to prove they know what the confrontation clause means? Why not go back to requiring someone to prove they can read before allowing them the right to vote? \n \n But perhaps the requirement you suggest to exercise the RKBA comes from your interpretation of this particular amendment. So let me ask you: How do you interpret the 2nd. Amendment? Do you believe it recognizes and protects an individual right of all citizens? Do you believe it recognizes and protects the right of militia members to have arms? Do you believe it recognizes and protects a \"state's right\" to arm its militia free from federal interference? \n \n \n ---\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\" Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting with approval 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764",

   "Did you even read the link he gave you? It explains everything quite well.\n\n \n The exact quote:\n \n \nI want to go back and take a look again at the \"militia clause\" of the Second Amendment. It is, after all, the focal point for gun control supporters who seek to limit the individual RKBA: \n \n \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\" \n \n I have argued before that the militia clause was never intended to limit the RKBA; rather, it was intended to express the opinion that standing armies ought to be avoided whenever possible, and that the best method of preventing government oppression was to rely on a militia composed of ordinary citizens. I came to this conclusion by asking myself this question: \n \n Why did Madison use the term \"free\" state? \n \n In looking at this I reached the conclusion that Madison is making a public policy statement for how to avoid the public ever fearing the ambitions of a tyrant who controls the standing army. In fact, it looks to me like he read this same public policy goal in the state constitutions, and he merely \"cut and pasted\" it into the Second Amendment. Here is a sample of state constitutional \"militia clauses\" he would have been exposed to (in chronological order of adoption):\n \n CONSTITUTION OF VIRGINIA (June 6, 1776)\n \n That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF PENNSYLVANIA (August 16, 1776)\n \n That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the state; And as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\n \n DELAWARE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS (September 11, 1776)\n \n That a well-regulated militia is the proper, natural and safe defense of a free government.\n \n That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up without the consent of the legislature.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF MARYLAND (November 3, 1776)\n \n That a well-regulated militia is the proper and natural defense of a free government.\n \n That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up, without consent of the legislature.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF NORTH CAROLINA (December 14, 1776)\n \n That the people have a right to bear arms, for the defense of the State; and, as standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF VERMONT (July 8, 1777)\n \n That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the State; and, as standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF MASSACHUSETTS (October 25, 1780)\n \n The people have a right to keep and bear arms for the common defense. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature, and the military power shall always be held in exact subordination to the civil authority, and be governed by it.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF NEW HAMPSHIRE (June 2, 1784)\n \n A well-regulated militia is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a state.\n \n Standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up without the consent of the legislature.\n \n You can see from these provisions that the reliance on a \"well regulated militia\" as opposed to a standing army was included in the state constitutions as an important public policy goal. This goal was also expressed repeatedly in the constitutional debates:\n \n \"Is it necessary for your liberty, that you should abandon those great rights by the adoption of this system?. . . Will the abandonment of your most sacred rights tend to the security of your liberty?. . . .I am fearful I have lived long enough to become an old fashioned fellow: Perhaps an invincible attachment to the dearest rights of man, may, in these refined enlightened days, be deemed old fashioned: If so, I am contented to be so. . . . Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it, but downright force: Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined. . . .\n \n My great objection to this Government is, that it does not leave us the means of defending our rights; or, of waging war against tyrants. . . .\n \n The Honorable Gentleman who presides, told us, that to prevent abuses in our Government, we will assemble in Convention, recall our delegated powers, and punish our servants for abusing the trust reposed in them. Oh, Sir, we should have fine times indeed, if to punish tyrants, it were only sufficient to assemble the people. Your arms wherewith you could defend yourselves, are gone. . . . Did you ever read of any revolution in any nation, brought about by the punishment of those in power, inflicted by those who had no power at all? You read of a riot act in a country [England] which is called one of the freest in the world, where a few neighbors cannot assemble without the risk of being shot by hired soldiery, the engines of despotism. We may see such an act in America. A standing army we shall have also, to execute the execrable commands of tyranny: And how are you to punish them? Will you order them to be punished? Who shall obey these orders? Will your Mace-bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment? In what situation are we to be? . . . .What resistance could be made? The attempt would be madness.\" Patrick Henry, Speeches of June 5 and 7, 1788, before the Virginia Ratifying Convention, reprinted in The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates, pages 199-216, Mentor Books, 1986, edited by Ralph Ketchum. \n \n \"It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen.\" John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)\n \n \"The power of the sword, say the minority of Pennsylvania, is in the hands of Congress. My friends and countrymen, it is not so, for the powers of the sword are in the hands of the yeomanry of America from sixteen to sixty. The militia of these free commonwealths, entitled and accustomed to their arms, when compared with any possible army, must be tremendous and irresistible. Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom? Congress shall have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American ....[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.\" Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.\n \n \"Little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped. . . .This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little if any inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their rights and those of their fellow citizens.\" Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers #29, reprinted at page 185 in The Federalist Papers, Mentor Books, 1969, edited by Clinton Rossiter.\n \n \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.\" Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n \"Whenever, therefore, the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated. . . .No free government was ever founded, or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state. . . .Such a well regulated militia, composed of freeholders, citizens and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen.\" M. T. Cicero (a pseudonym), Charleston State Gazette, September 8, 1788.\n \n \"A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia. . . .[of the select militia] These Corps, not much unlike regular troops, well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. . . .The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it.\" Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer, p. 169-170 (1788)\n \n Now public policy statements like the state constitutional \"militia clauses\" were nothing new to Madison, and they were in fact not limited only to the RKBA. Consider, for example, the Constitution of Virginia once again, this time regarding the freedoms of press and religion:\n \n \"That the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic governments.\"\n \n \"That religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and, therefore, all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience....\"\n \n In both of these provisions you see the use of policy statements which precede the substantive right, and in neither case do you find any credible argument that the policy preamble somehow limits the substantive right. I believe the same is true for the Second Amendment.\n \n In my opinion, the language \"[a] well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a FREE state\" was never intended by our founding fathers to limit the right of the people to keep and bear private arms. Rather, it is merely a preamble o the RKBA which states the universally held principle that \"standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty.\" Tench Coxe, who helped Madison campaign for the ratification of his BoR, described the Second Amendment similarly: \n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\" Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1 \n \n There is, in my opinion, no credible argument for divorcing the militia clause from its roots and using it instead as a rope to tie up and restrict the individual RKBA.\n \n Why then is the \"militia clause\" included in the 2nd. Amendment with the RKBA? I think it was for the reason mentioned in the case incorrectly cited most often as supporting the position that there is no individual right to keep and bear arms--U.S. v. Miller:\n \n \"The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of the Colonies and the States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. \"A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.\" And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.\" United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939).\n \n The militias of the time were comprised primarily of citizens bearing their private arms-hence the natural inclusion of the militia preamble within the amendment which also protects the individual right to keep and bear arms. \n \n Now the temptation arises for gun control supporters to say: \"well then, this must be the purpose of the RKBA after all, and since we no longer rely on privately held arms to equip the state militias, then we really don't need the right to keep and bear arms anymore.\" \n \n There are any number of responses to this argument, but I respond as follows:\n \n First, do not ignore what Noah Webster and Tench Coxe said about the individual RKBA as quoted above, and go back to read Miller again. You will find this: \"If the citizens have these arms in their hands, they are prepared in the best possible manner to repel any encroachments upon their rights....\" Miller at p. 178, citing Aymette v. State, 2 Hump. (21 Tenn.) 154, 158 (1840).\n \n Second, consider the practical effect of such an argument. Everyone agrees the first ten amendments to the Constitution were enacted to restrict the ability of our national government to \"overleap the bounds\" of its authority and power. The Second Amendment's guarantee of the people's right to keep and bear arms provides a direct check on the ability of the government to engage in mischief against its citizens. As others have said before, it was included as one of the first ten amendments to provide a check against the government's attempts to take away the other nine.\n \n Are we now to suggest that our government can be permitted to unilaterally abolish a check on its power by creating a circumstance which allows it to claim that the check is not only dangerous to society but also no longer needed--that it can simply \"cut and paste\" an Amendment out of the Constitution? If this argument is accepted at face value, then are not all the rights contained in the Bill of Rights placed in doubt? If you argue, as the Brady Campaign does, that the right to keep and bear arms is \"anachronistic\" and should be abolished, then are you ready to have the same argument used against you by those who would have us believe that in the age of global terror the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures is also anachronistic? In the final analysis, I believe that such short-sighted attacks on the right to keep and bear arms serve ultimately to encourage assaults upon the other rights our Constitution also recognizes and protects.\n \n --- \n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, New haven, 1921.\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Justice Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) (dissenting opinion).\n",

He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Our ancestors, by being always armed, and frequently in action, defended themselves against the Romans, Danes, and English; and maintained their liberty against encroachments of their own princes.\" Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749).",

   "bryan,\n \n How do YOU interpret the \"well-regulated militia\" clause? \n \n Still firing softballs, we see.\n \n The word \"regulated\" stems from the Latin word \"regula\" which means subject to rules, as in \"regular clergy\" in the RC Christian church - monks as opposed to other religious.\n \n The Framers, having received classical educations, were well aware of that fact.\n \n They were clear that the members of the \"militia\" were subject to rules, such as the training and drilling that DrNo has stated.\n \n Once again, when are you and the rest of the gun nuts going to muster out for your drilling and training that membership in the militia (and 2A) demands as a condition of your being considered part of the \"militia\"?\n\n \n ---\n \n Bryan responds:\n \n Alright bhbcu64, Let me answer all your questions first before I ask only one in return: \n \n To answer your earlier demand that I provide a view on the definition of \"well-regulated\": I believe the words mean what the Miller case described when it defined the term \"militia.\"\n \n To answer your demand that someone tell you why Madison and the other framers included the words \"well-regulated,\" I ask that you go read my earlier link, because I explained it there. I believe the framers chose to write the militia clause as a public policy statement that it was better to rely for safety upon a well-regulated militia rather than risk encouraging domestic tyranny through reliance on a standing army. \n \n Finally, to answer your latest question: I choose not to appear at any militia training muster you imagine. The amendment was never intended to require enrollment in a militia training program as a pre-requisite to exercising the individual RKBA. The express wording of the 2nd. Amendment does not impose or even remotely imply such a requirement. I believe your militia training requirement is a fiction which has no basis in reality beyond your imagination. But you knew that, and you are welcome to stop side-stepping the issue and actually make you case otherwise. \n \n There now, I have given you an answer to every question you have posed to me. Disagree if you will. \n \n We began this discussion because you challenged me to a debate and called me out to answer a question. Don't run away from it now. I answered your question in good faith by giving you my opinion that the militia clause is nothing more than a preamble which does not limit the substantive clause which follows it. I knew when I took up your debate offer that you would not accept what I say merely because I said it. This is why I cited you to authority which supported my position and directly contradicted yours. I am sorry you have chosen to ignore it and pretend that history which contradicts your opinions cannot exist. \n \n Look, I know you felt like you had to respond asap when I posted a link to my interpretation of the militia clause, and that the 4 minutes it took you to see my post, click the link, presumably read what I said, and post something in return did not permit much time for thought. Yet I had hoped that ruminating on the issue overnight would have led to something beyond merely reposting your belief in the militia training duty requirement. You cannot imagine my disappointment today with your inability to hit my softballs. So now, to dispel the possibility of any confusion on your part, let me put it to you plainly....\n \n We can agree that our views are in direct conflict over what the impact the militia clause has, if any, on the substantive RKBA clause which follows in the Amendment. You know my view, and you now know the authority I chose to provide to you which supports it. \n \n I likewise know your view. You have posted it without providing authority for it repeatedly. Now in fairness I want to know the source of your view, and you must admit that having been given the consideration of seeing my sources you no longer have a legitimate claim to continue hiding yours from me. Indeed, you implied to others that you had authority but would not provide it until someone explained why the framers used the words \"well-regulated.\" I have now done so for you twice, and its time for you to go or get off the pot. You will truly earn the label of hypocrisy if you continue to demand that others explain their reasoning behind their positions if you continue to blanch and fall silent when the same is asked of you. So gird your loins like a man, my friend, and declare, if thou knowest: \n \n Is there any authority for your position which exists beyond your imagination, or are you prepared to admit in the alternative that you have none? That is my question for you.\n \n You and I are just getting started, my friend, and I'm still \"firing softballs,\" as you put it. I merely add the comment that there is no better time than now for you to stop pointing at the fence and instead prove you can actually hit one of them. Please tell me I haven't overestimated you, and that this question is not beyond you. I have gauged your display of confidence in your opinion, and I have deliberately chosen to hang this question in your \"wheel house.\" Don't disappoint me by going down looking on this one. \n \n ---\n \n \"I do not at all resent criticism, even when, for the sake of emphasis, it for a time parts company with reality.\" Sir Winston Spencer Churchill, Speech in the House of Commons, January 22, 1941\n \n \"Again, I learned a lot; especially that the rank and file are usually much more primitive than we imagine. Propaganda must therefore always be essentially simple and repetitious. In the long run only he will achieve basic results in influencing public opinion who is able to reduce problems to the simplest terms and who has the courage to keep forever repeating them in this simplified form despite the objections of the intellectuals.\" Paul Joseph Goebbels, The Goebbels Diaries, 1942-1943, edited and translated by Louis P.

This just proves your own stupidity.\n \n Another aspect of how stupid your entire argument is, is the supposed claim that the Second Amendment was introduced in order to give the government power over regular citizens to compel them to serve in its own private army or forever lose their rights and be unarmed and defensless and unable to protect themselves.\n \n This is the last time I'm going to ask you for the information to support your claim.

Exactly where, in what historical document, has it ever been stated that the Second Amendment is directly contingent upon service in any kind of militia and that annual drilling and practice were a mandatory requirement for that right? Where exactly is it stated \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms is dependant on their service in the militia, and failure to serve or fall in for practice is ground for revocation of that right\"? And furthermore where was it said that the right to keep and bear arms will be dissolved once one reaches an age that makes them non-able-bodied for militia service?\n \n Either supply me with this evidence by the time of your very next post in this thread, or everyone will know that you're simply lying and trying to make people angry because you're nothing more than a lowly internet troll.",

   "These were wordsmiths who chose each and every word carefully.\n\n \n Explain then the reference to a \"more perfect union\". How can something be more than perfect? \n \n Be that as it may, For the sake of this rhetorical exercise I will cede your point regarding the verbal infallibility of the Founders. Let us then examine the text of the amendment at question:\n \n \nA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. \n\n \n Let us now construct a sentence using parallel structure:\n \n \"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be infringed.\" \n \n Would you infer from the above sentence that only the well schooled should be allowed to possess and read books? Or more likely would you recognize that the ability for the people to keep and read books CREATES the well schooled electorate?\n \n If you were infering along the lines of grammar, you would note that there is only one independent clause in the 2nd Amendment. That is \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" If you still wish to persist in your strained interpretatation and insist that arms are only for the Well Regulated Militia, you should perhaps consider the origin of the term \"well regulated militia\".\n \n The term is discussed at length by Nicoloco Machiaveli, that wonderful Author of The Prince. In his 1521 book The Art of War, Mac explains why a \"well ordered militia\" (yes he uses the term) was necessary for the security of the free state. He listed three criteria that a militia must meet. They are:\n \n \n 1) The \"well-regulated militia\" must include the whole body of the people; \n \n 2) The members of the \"well-regulated militia\" must own their own arms; and \n \n 3) The \"well-regulated militia\" must not be controlled by the central government, and, in fact, should elect its own officers.\n \n Andrew Fletcher, a Scottish Whig wrote In Discourse of Government With Respect to Militias in 1698. He used the same three criteria to define \"well regulated militia\".\n \n Many of the Early American Whig thinkers were heavily influenced by the writings of Fletcher and particularly Machiavelli. Among those influenced include George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hancock, and most notably James Madison - the Father of the Constitution. \n \n Now you may conjecture that the Founders accidentally used a subordinate clause in the 2nd amendment. You may believe that the 2nd is the only amendment to refer to a group rather than individual right. You may attempt to renounce the bulk of history that recognizes the Macchiaveli's Liberal-Republican Legacy. You may even believe that the Founders rejected Mac's definition of a \"well regulated militia\" but declined to explain that break with 250 years of established criteria. Yes, you are free to believe all of these things separately in the name of cynicism, but to believe all of these things collectively requires ignorance not cynicism.",

This is the argument of a XXXXX. Nothing in the entire Bill of Rights, the list of rights that the citizens of America are to enjoy freely, is about giving any amount of control or power to any governmental body, when that's what we sought to escape from so dearly. It's called the Bill of Rights for a reason, it's not called the Bill of Governmental Powers.\n \n Only someone of questionable intelligence would ever, for even one second, consider the thought that the Founding Fathers wanted to cement the foundation for a government with control over its people, by explicitly or implicitly wording such a foundation in a bill that empowers the individual citizens.\n \n You've also yet to prove that someone's right to own a gun, for any reason, could be immediately and permanently revoked if that person refused to fall in for regular drilling or answer the call to arms when a crisis arose.

   "<snip<A bunch of wrong stuff<snip<\n\n \n \n To be blunt Mr Today's Arrogant Sarcastic yet so Incorrect Poster your argument is a misconstruction flowing from a fallacy that springs from a profound ignorance of the fundamental principles of this nation.\n \n Your position fails on simple philosophical ideals. . .\n \n You fail to recognize and understand that the militia concept, the political philosophy that the entire mass of private citizens having their personal arms in their hands, without regulation of law or permission of authorities, standing as a barrier to domestic tyrants and foreign invaders, is an inseparable component of our form of government, (\"undoubtedly true\" as SCOTUS put it in Presser). It just is . . . \n \n As you say, the founders were learned men, well read and immersed in political theory and philosophy but you don't seem to realize the writers and works they embraced as instructional feature an armed citizenry keeping government in check. The armed citizenry formed into militias when necessary is a core part of the classical republic the founders established; it needs no action of Congress to exist, only to function . . . And that is where government is derelict in their duty. My right to keep and bear arms is not dependent upon the government initiating or continuing any program or structure. As the great constitutional commentator Thomas Cooley said (and cited by the Court in Miller):\n \"It may be supposed from the phraseology of this provision that the right to keep and bear arms was only guaranteed to the militia; but this would be an interpretation not warranted by the intent. The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms, and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose. But this enables the government to have a well-regulated militia; for to bear arms implies something more than the mere keeping; it implies the learning to handle and use them in a way that makes those who keep them ready for their efficient use; in other words, it implies the right to meet for voluntary discipline in arms, observing in doing so the laws of public order.\" -- Thomas M. Cooley, The General Principles of Constitutional Law in the United States of America 1891\n Your ignorance of those facts leads to creating the fallacy that this entity described as the \"well regulated militia\" needed to be created, defined and nurtured by the 2nd Amendment. \n \n The declaratory clause of the 2nd Amendment is primarily stating a universally embraced maxim; that militia, properly functioning and in operational order and condition, is necessary to the freedom of the nation. \n \n This statement is both complementary to and a corollary of, the often repeated declarations in state RKBA provisions regarding standing armies i.e., standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty. The term \"standing army\" had little distinction from \"select militia\" in the minds of the framers; it is preposterous to think that the 2nd Amendment establishes and demands exactly that which was so universally abhorred by excluding the regular, private citizen and his own personal arms from the protections of the 2nd Amendment. This reduces the 2nd Amendment to nothing more than a Trojan Horse; misrepresented to the people as being a \"declaratory and restrictive clause\" to be added to the Constitution, \"in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of [federal] powers.\" \n \n Under your \"collective right\" argument the 2nd would create conditions and circumstances on the exercise of the RKBA under which the federal government would be sole entity determining who are the \"approved\" arms bearers and would then be authorized to move to disarm the \"unapproved.\" \n \n Of course these right limiting federal qualifications and criteria would be exercised without regard to the position of any state legislature or opinion of any state court . . . Paradoxically this interpretation would completely extinguish the \"state's right\" theory of the 2nd (upon which so many lower federal gun court control cases rest upon).\n \n If one is compelled to argue that the declaratory clause \"must\" have a meaning or purpose linked directly to the RKBA as secured by the 2nd Amendment I would comfortably argue that it explains why the pre-existing right is being secured. This is exactly the point where the \"collective right\" gun controllers go completely off on their tangent that is completely unsupported constitutionally speaking. \n \n Specifically, they take the Miller case's explanation of the \"object\" of the Amendment, the Amendment's foundational purpose, and apply it to the right merely recognized and guaranteed by the Amendment. \n \n We all read, \"[W]ith obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such forces the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment were made.\" I take that as an explanation of why the Amendment exists; collective right people read that as telling us why the right to arms exists. Of course, that conclusion is wrong because SCOTUS would never so diametrically oppose its precedent without directly and unambiguously overruling it. Collective right people are in for a rude awakening in June when DC v Heller is handed down . . . Why? Because their entire argument is smoke and mirrors.\n \n You are following in their muddy footprints on the clean parchment of the Bill of Rights. Lucky for America SCOTUS will soon come through with a big mop washing away the crud you guys have tracked all over . . .",

   "Your argument fails on two other points:\n \n Again I mention that you agree that the framers were learned men, they were well versed in the classics and classical languages such as Latin. Your position that the declaratory clause conditions the right is without linguistic support. The framers would never predicate a new mandate for militia organization, training and structure (and thus modifying Art I \u00a78 powers) on an absolute phrase that, following form, is not a complete sentence . . . \n \n An absolute phrase might explain why what follows could happen or perhaps why it may be prudent to take the following action but it does not change or condition or create a dependency on what follows. Let's examine a very simple one:\n All things considered, it's not a bad idea.\n Whether or not the idea is bad or not, does not depend upon if all things were actually, truthfully and exhaustively considered or if that anything at all must be considered to in fact decide if the idea is bad or not.\n \n Let's try another simple one to make sure the principle is understood:\n The teacher being ill, class is canceled.\n Can the class only be canceled if the teacher is sick? \n What if he is lying about being sick and is actually out playing golf; is class still canceled? \n Must class always be canceled if the teacher is ill? What if the teacher is ill but toughs it out and comes in, can the class be held?\n \n Now we move on . . . Let's see if we can force reading qualifications and conditions onto the restrictive clause in sentences grammatically constructed like the 2nd Amendment with an declaratory absolute clause preceding the actionable, restrictive clause . . .\n A well maintained road system being necessary to efficiently commute to and from work, the right of the people to keep and drive automobiles shall not be infringed.\n Can the people only use automobiles to commute to and from work? \n Are retired persons or housewives or the independently wealthy to be \"deautoed\" because they do not work? \n Can the people only drive on a governmentally maintained road system? \n Can they only drive on those specific roads deemed by the government to be necessary for commuting? \n Are the people barred from taking a scenic route to and from work, is the most efficient route the only one deemed \"legal?\"\n \n Let's try one more:\n A well educated electorate being necessary for the perpetuation of a free state, the right of the people to keep and read books shall not be infringed.\n Can only registered voters (the electorate) keep and read books? \n Can only those books deemed \"necessary to the perpetuation of a free state\" be owned and read? \n Can books deemed NOT \"necessary to the perpetuation of a free state\" be banned?\n Can books that openly threaten the \"perpetuation of a free state\" be banned?\n Can only those with an government certified IQ above 120 and deemed \"well educated\" by the government, keep and read books?\n \n Expecting to fully understand the 2nd when one is completely ignorant of the principles behind it and the rules of the provision's construction is folly and leads to exactly the positions you have posited. You are giving the 2nd a cursory reading applying modern definitions and inferences to the lexicon of the founders and that leads you to incorrect opinions on the meaning and the interpretation of the 2nd. \n \n The second point upon which your position fails is that in order to argue that certain words, the lexicon and linguistics, the punctuation and general construction of the 2nd impart conditions, qualifications and exceptions on the right, requires one to hold that the right emanates from those words and that construction. In arguing that, one is arguing against the fundamental constitutional principle that rights are not granted, conferred or established by the Bill of Rights and ignoring direct Supreme Court precedent reaffirming that principle multiple times. \n \n If, as SCOTUS has said, the right to arms is not granted by the Constitution and the right to arms is in no way dependent upon the Constitution for its existence, how can the words upon which the right DOES NOT DEPEND be \"interpreted\" to dictate the scope and extent of the right to arms?",

It's now your turn to answer mine or admit by silence that you cannot. \n \n I don't want to run you off, bhbcu64. I came across you while shopping here in the free marketplace of ideas. You intrigued me with the promise of being able to sell something new. I've noticed, however, that the shelves in corner stall you have erected here appear to be mighty bare. Now is your chance to avoid bankruptcy by filling them up if you can. \n \n While you contemplate your answer (which we both know you would have provided by now if you had one), let me make a couple of other observations....\n \n #1 You should really take the time to learn the history behind the 14th. Amendment before you use it here as justification against an individual RKBA. Try reading this first:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=3546 \n \n Oh, and another hint. Even if you don't read it, please take more than 4 minutes to post a reply saying \"you're wrong.\" That way it will at least appear you gave your answer some thought.\n \n #2 Heed your own words for once: \"why not try reading the plain text of 2A?\"-AND-\"The Framers, Madison especially, were not the type to use the English language in a careless manner. If they said something, they meant it.\"\n \n With this in mind, tell me (if you can) what was meant by the words \"the right of the people\"? (It might help you to first read and reflect upon the selected readings below, and to also remember that it reflects poorly on your playing ability if you can't seem to hit any of these \"softballs\"). \n \n ---\n \n \"Instances of the licentious and outrageous behavior of the military conservators of the peace still multiply upon us, some of which are of such a nature, and have been carried to so great lengths, as must serve fully to evince that a late vote of this town, calling upon the inhabitants [of Boston] to provide themselves with arms for their defense, was a measure as prudent as it was legal. . . .It is a natural right which the people have reserved to themselves, confirmed by the Bill of Rights, to keep arms for their defense; and as Mr. Blackstone observes, it is to be made use of when the sanctions of society and law are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression....It is certainly beyond human art and sophistry, to prove that the British subjects, to whom the privilege of possessing arms is expressly recognized by the Bill of Rights,. . .are guilty of an illegal act, in calling upon one another to be provided with them, as the law directs.\" O. Dickerson ed., Boston Under Military Rule, p79 (1936) [quoting from what was at the time the most widely circulated periodical in the colonies, A Journal of the Times].\n \n \"Nothing will make a nation so unconquerable as a militia, or every man's being trained to arms. . . . And if the generality of housekeepers were only half disciplined, a designing prince, or ministry, would hardly dare to provoke the people by an open attack on their liberties. . . .But without the people's having some knowledge of arms, I see not what is to secure them against slavery. . . .The confidence, which a standing army gives a minister, puts him upon carrying things with a higher hand, than he would attempt to do, if the people were armed, and the court unarmed, that is, if there were no land-force in the nation, but a militia. Had we [England] at this time no standing army, we should not think of forcing money out of the pockets of three millions of our subjects. .[a long list of injustices suffered by the colonists is omitted here] . .There is no end to observations on the difference between the measures likely to be pursued by a minister backed by a standing army, and those of a court awed by the fear of an armed people.\" James Burgh, 2 Political Disquisitions, pp. 390 and 475-76. (London 1774).\n \n \"General Gage . . . sent ought from [Boston] a large detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked assault on the inhabitants of the said province, at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of a great many persons, some of whom were officers and soldiers of the detachment, murdered eight of the inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord, where they set upon another party of the inhabitants of the same province, killing several and wounding more, until compelled to retreat by the country people suddenly assembled to repel this cruel aggression....\n \n The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind....\n \n The general, further emulating his ministerial masters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th. of June, after venting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies, proceeds to '[D]eclare them all, either by name or description, to be rebels and traitors, to supersede the course of the common law, and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise of the law martial'....\n \n We are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission to the tyranny of irritated ministers, or resistance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the cost of this contest, and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery. Honor, justice, and humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them, if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon them.\n \n Our cause is Just. Our Union is Perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable. - We gratefully acknowledge, as signal instances of the Divine favor towards us, that his Providence would not permit us to be called into this severe controversy, until we were grown up to our present strength, had been previously exercised in warlike operation, and possessed of the means of defending ourselves. With hearts fortified with these animating reflections, we most solemnly, before God and the world, declare, that, exerting the utmost energy of those powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness and perseverance, employ for the preservation of our liberties; being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves.\n \n We fight not for glory or for conquest. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation or even suspicion of offence. They boast of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than servitude or death.\n \n In our own native land, in defense of the freedom that is our birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it - for the protection of our property, acquired solely by the honest industry of our fore-fathers and ourselves, against violence actually offered, we have taken up arms. We shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed, and not before.\"\n (selections taken from the Continental Congress' Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms [July 6, 1775] starting at p. 286 in Sources Of Our Liberties, American Bar Foundation, Richard L. Perry, editor, revised edition (William S. Hein & Co. 1990) .",

   "Let's look at this is a logical manner. The \"well regulated militia\" argument is a completely dead subject, and anybody who tries to argue it is without mental standing.\n \n The argument that the right of the people to keep and bear arms is directly contingent upon the people's service in the militia is completely illogical. If you're not allowed to own guns unless you serve in the militia, but you can't serve in the militia without guns, how can you own guns in the first place? This is a chicken or the egg position that is doomed to failure.\n \n Let's say that if people couldn't buy their own guns for militia duty then it's the job of the government to step up and take on the task of outfitting the militia with arms for service. This is completely illogical. Let's say that it's determined that the militia referred to in the Second Amendment truly is all able-bodied citizens of a certain age and without a criminal record. Let's say that the number of people that can qualify as member of the militia is a conservative 65% of the American population. That's 195 million people that must be outfitted with government purchased firearms. \n \n If the government sees fit to only supply sidearms and service rifles, the M4 carbine costing approximately $1,600 each, and the M9 pistol costing about $600 each, that's a total of $2,200 the government will be required to spend for each of those 195 million individuals, meaning that to outfit the militia the government will need to spend that would be approximately $4.3 TRILLION! Just supplying the service weapons to the militia would be more expensive than the annual funding bill of the War in Iraq. And that doesn't factor in training or ammunition cost or anything else, that's just for the guns themselves.\n \n Further making the \"well regulated militia\" argument completely illogical, is the supposed belief that anybody who fails to fall in for regular training or take part in deployment would lose their right to own guns. This position basically states that the due process clause of the 5th Amendment is meaningless and can be violated at anytime.\n \n The entire first part of the Second Amendment is directly contingent on the second part of the Second Amendment being upheld, meaning that the militia is entirely dependant on the ability of American citizens to freely own guns, meaning that gun control laws directly harm the militia and are a crime against America.\n \n Even further making the entire argument without basis is the notion that the Founding Fathers of America would institute a way of granting the government power, while at the exact same time wording this power into a list of rights the citizens are to enjoy that the government can't infringe upon. This means that the Bill of Rights sets limits on governmental power, while at the same time giving it the power to control people as it sees fit.",

Instead of specifying that only able bodied males are a part of this militia, they left it as the people, meaning the entire population. This was to hinder the possibility of turning this general militia into a select militia. The founding fathers chose to omit the objector clause (originaly submitted to give people relief from militia duty for religous purposes), in order to further hinder the making of a select militia. The federal and state governments no longer provide for the organization of this general militia that the ammendment speaks of. This, however does not grant any government the power to disarm the people. The fact that the government fails to keep up it's duty to regulate the militia does not mean that it has in any way been abolished, as in for the adoption of the National Guard (a select militia of sorts). It is clear by the language of the ammendment and the general feeling at the time of it's adoption that the purpose was to not allow the government, especially the federal government, a monopoly of the means to create violence, as the founding fathers knew this to undoubtably lead to tyranny in one form or another. Article I section 8 of the constitution confirms this by saying that one of the purposed of the militia powers of congress was to stop insurections. This power as given to the people and not the the government in the form of a select army signifies that the ammendment was set forth so that popular uprisings were still possible. This implication is confirmed in the same section, as the constitution gives the congress the authority to provide for a navy. A navy differs from an army in that it requires constant attendance from it's members, not just weekend drills and partial attendance in times of need. This proves that the founding fathers understood the diference between a militia and a military. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that the sole purpose for the preamble (to the ammendment) was to imply that congress has the duty to provide for the organization of a fighting force in the form of militia, as an unorganized force is significantly less capable than an organized enemy. That way both ends were met: The country was safe from foreign invasion, and the country was safe from domestic tyranny.\n \n Ghost Rider, please do not respond immediatly to this. Wait a little.

   "grider,\n \n I DID read it, and I found this:\n \n 3.11 Did the early state leadership exercise much control over the militia?\n A. When the Founding Fathers referred to the militia, they were referring to the state organizations that had already existed for decades or even more than a century in some states by 1787. These state organizations had extensive militia codes which regulated who would be and who would not be in the militia, how, when and where militia members would train, who would officer the militia, what the punishment for transgressions would be, how the militia could be called up, etc. Although it was common for people to refer to the state militias as consisting of all the people, since they did consist of one whole heck of a lot of the people, anyway, in actual fact, exemptions were very common, and it was easy for wealthy or privileged people to avoid militia service. These state organizations were hierarchical in nature. In some states officers were elected; in others, they were appointed by the state. The entire state was usually organized into geographical divisions which corresponded with a military division. Divisions were geographically subdivided into brigades, regiments, and companies, just like regular military units. In Southern states, regiments often corresponded with counties, and militia captains had additional civil responsibilities, such as handling elections or appointing slave patrols. \n It is a mistake,to conceive of the militia merely as a mass of individual men with guns. Though indeed they were citizen-soldiers, they were as organized as eighteenth century society could organize Americans, and when they were called out, it was usually through a top-down, organized fashion.[MP]",

   "Excellent posts K. \n \n Now we are getting somewhere. Let me advance some thoughts upon it further. It cannot be disputed that the individual RKBA pre-existed the Constitution. Both Federalists and Anti-federalists are in accord on this point, and this is vital to understanding how our founders viewed both the RKBA and the militia concept. Their first goal was to ensure an armed populace. The second was to avoid the danger of a standing army by drawing instead upon these armed citizens to form militias. \n \n The problem with bhbcu64's argument is the assumption that the chicken came before the egg. There is no credible evidence to suggest that participation in militia mustering was a pre-requisite for exercising one's individual RKBA. Rather, the militias grew out of the broader pre-existing individual RKBA. \n \n The RKBA is not a select club whose membership initiation requires enrolling in a militia as a cost of having a gun. It is rather an independent and universal right which can support but does not depend on militia service, and which serves by itself as a deterrent to tyranny:\n \n Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive. Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n It is critical to understand this next point: Just as the RKBA exists independent of the militia system, the grant of power to both the Congress and the states over militias is likewise independent of whether we as individuals have chosen to exercise the RKBA or not. We men are all, whether we have ever exercised the RKBA before or not, subject to being called for service in the army or in a militia. \n \n The better question for bhbcu64 is this: If the state called you to appear for militia service, do you believe you could avoid it by saying I am immune because I have never exercised my RKBA before? \n \n Read Miller again and how it described the arming of the militias. The members of the already armed populace appeared bearing their own pre-existing arms when called. This was the status of the militias before the Constitution was adopted. \n \n Then along comes our Constitution and its Art. I section 8 grant of power to Congress to also \"arm\" the militias. Various authors who considered this power proffered the fear that Congress could disarm the militias merely by a willful inattention to its duty to arm them, and thus they argued a need exists for an independent source of arms. I agree that one purpose of recognizing the individual RKBA within the BoR was to ensure that Congress did not have the monopoly on the true badges of liberty. \n \n Our system of government recognizes three entities: The federal government, the state governments, and the people. When the founders decided to prevent the federal government from assuming this supposed arms monopoly they had the choice to either grant a new counterbalance \"right\" to the states, or they could instead recognize the pre-existing right of the people (or they could have done both, which I find no one has suggested is the case). \n \n They did not create a new \"right\" of the states to balance this federal power. And here is where I agree with bbcu64's argument that they were wordsmiths. They did not state \"the right of the states to keep and bear arms\" or \"the states are hereby granted concurrent power to also arm their militias free from federal interference.\" They instead chose to counterbalance the federal power through forced recognition of what was already working for them and what they already knew to be accepted fact-the individual RKBA. Recognizing this right effectively denied Congress the ability to threaten our freedoms through total disarmament. This armed populace deterrent is exactly what the Amendment's author meant when he preceeded his discussion of the advantages of states militias with the statement:\n \n Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation. . . . James Madison, The Federalist Papers # 46, reprinted at page 294 in The Federalist Papers, Mentor Books, 1969, edited by Clinton Rossiter. \n \n ---\n \n Mr. Madison has introduced his long expected amendments. . . .It contains a bill of rights [including] . . . .the right to keep and bear arms.--Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 52-53 (1854) [Letter to Thomas Dwight, June 11, 1789].\n \n The rights of conscience, of bearing arms, of changing the government, are declared to be inherent in the people. Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 53-54 (1854) [Letter to F. I. Minoe, June 12, 1789].\n \n Last Monday, a string of amendments were presented to the lower house; these altogether respected personal liberty. . . William Grayson, 3 Patrick Henry, p. 391 (1951) [letter from Grayson to Henry, June 12, 1789].\n \n As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms. Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1.\n \n For those who can possess and wield arms are in a position to decide whether the constitution is to continue or not.

It conscripted every \"free able-bodied white male citizen\" between the ages of 18 and 45 into a local militia company overseen by the state. Militia members were required to arm themselves at their own expense with a musket, bayonet and belt, two spare flints, a cartridge box with 24 rounds of ammunition, and a knapsack.

   "Ah, so you've finally decided to swing at one? To answer your question, bhbcu64: No, the state cannot force you to purchase a firearm, nor does my position require that outcome. I know you speak of insanity often, but this is not a bipolar issue. It is not either we all must own them and all appear for militia service or no one can have one. \n \n Now let me turn to your method of responding while avoiding my questions. How can you say someone else has tucked their tail and run from you? You can't even see them--unless you're looking over your shoulder while running from me. Where is the debate you said we would have? I can't understand why you would raise the gale and then hide in the harbor from my questions. \n \n I have seen quite a few debates in my time, and it never ceases to amaze me how consistently human nature causes people to respond with frustration when confronted with their own inadequacy. You are not the first sexually unsatisfied person who felt it necessary to interject a juvenile reference to a sexual organ in their post. You're not the first person whose overly large ego led them to seek to assuage their wounded pride by calling their opponents \"nuts\" or \"irrational.\" I've seen this kind of behavior before, bhbcu64, and when I saw you begin this progression I said to myself I hope he proves different from the others. \n \n And in one sense you have. I have seen many people deal with insecurity by claiming to be more rational, more sane, or more intelligent than those who would dare disagree with them. But what makes you unique-and worth further study-is your remarkable ability to make these claims and still be so successful at concealing all evidence of a superior intellect. \n \n Surely you must realize by now there is a reason behind the accepted belief that you are blissfully free of the ravages of intelligence? None of us here knows you from Adam. We have nothing upon which to base an opinion of your intellect other than what you display here in your writings. Please go back and read what you have blogged. Even you must confess, if only to yourself, that the body of your poor prose shows little sign of the spark of intelligence. \n \n But listen, I am not yet ready to agree with the judgment that you are of below average intellect. Rather, I sense that what intelligence exists in your posts is overridden by stubbornness, pride, and dishonesty. You simply cannot bring yourself to admit you might be wrong. You have become such a jealous guard of your fragile ego that truth has become relative to you-truths which you think are helpful become gospel-truths which prove inconvenient are shelved to be forgotten behind the curtain Dorothy was warned not to look behind.\n \n There is hope, bhbcu64. Stupid is forever, but dishonesty can be cured if only you have the courage to do so. I will even offer my assistance in your reformation free of charge. \n \n I'm being brutally honest with you today bhbcu64 because I do not suffer fools gladly. Kesseltron and I were beginning to have a productive discussion about the militia clause, and here you show back up like the loud, drunk uncle that embarrasses the family with his antics. In reality I'm probably less frustrated with you than I am with myself. I admit it is my fault, since I provoked you by throwing a question at you. In my defense, however, I would point out that you have run away from all other invitations to answer my questions, and I did not expect you to find courage in the bottle this one time.\n \n Now, my friend-cue the Eagles track, take another shot of courage, and answer my questions. You have seen them before: \n \n What is your authority for your militia training requirement argument?\n \n What do you think the founders meant by the words \"the right of the people\"?\n \n Since you broached this topic, is there anything within the language or the history of the 14th.

   "Bryan,\n \n What is your authority for your militia training requirement argument?\n \n \n Who said anything about trianing, although it certaily is a very tiny leap of logic from the \"well regulated\" clause to training.\n \n Are you so dense or ignorant that you do not know the meaning of the word \"regulate\"?\n \n FYI, it comes from the Latin word \"regula\" which means subject to rule.\n \n For any of you gun nuts to declare that this is meaningless verbiage in 2A simply flies in the face of and is an insult to Madison and the other Framers' intelligence.\n \n It simply means that the militia is subject to rules, not merely an unorganized rabble.\n \n I would think that responsible firearms owners, and I have no reason to doubt that you are one, would be clamoring long and loud for such continuing training for gun owners in case should the \"militia\" might ever need to be called up.\n \n Would you really want to be shoulder to shoulder with someone whose only weapon was a Saturday night special that he or she did not know how to operate properly?:xbanghead \n \n Now, sweetie, how about departing from your preprinted talking points and engage the issue.\n\n \n \n Does this mean you are ready to have our debate?

His mere criticism of the Miller and Heller cases are clear examples of this.\n \n \n Why? Simply because his rational POV differs from your emotional one?\n \n Sorry, old chap, but you do not have the final decision about which opinion is determinative of the issue.\n \n As all three authors take pains to point out, there is considerable difference of opinion on the topic.\n \n Neither side has a monopoly on the \"truth\", whatever it may be.\n\n \n \n Imagine that, we are past the 148th post and the gun-grabbers are still doing doing exactly what I said (in post #2) that gun-grabbers would do -smoke and mirrors, claims of amibiguity, etc. A.K.A Sophistry.\n \n Also a particular gun-grabber still refuses to do, just what I said gun-grabbers would refuse do -confront head on the evidence in US v. Miller that neither the duty to keep and bear arms, nor the right to keep and bear arms was limited to members of the actively training militia. \n \n \n Saul Cornell engages in evidence barring and illogical inferences to arrive at unsupportable conclusions. He ought to head a department of Sophistry rather than History as his arguments mock rational thought rather than employ or promote it. \n \n A prime example of Cornell's sophistry in action is his treatment of Hamilton's Federalist 29 and in which Cornell simply excludes from evidence Hamilton's statement that in his plan for the miltia, \"the people at large\", meaning those not undergoing regular training, would also be armed. Instead Cornell merely points out that Hamilton's definition of \"well-regulated miltia\" is one that is armed and trained to a tolerable degree of expertness. \n \n \n ``The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious, if it were capable of being carried into execution. A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a week, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss. It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the present numbers of the people, would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil establishments of all the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent, would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not succeed, because it would not long be endured. Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year\" (my emphasis)\n \n Hamilton's plan did not require all those who had a duty to be armed to undergo training, in fact Hamilton thought it foolish from the POV of economics. \n \n Cornell and the rest of the gun-grabbing Sophists (i.e. Historians of DC Amici infamy, Professors of Linguistics, etc. ) are entitled to their opinions, but they are not entitled to their own selective set of facts if they seek to engage in honest debate.",
