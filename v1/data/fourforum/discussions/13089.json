You don't even want to talk about scare mongering here, because your side is full of such tactics.\n \n Who can forget the infamous statements about the .50 BMG alone? That it can shoot a plane out of the sky with a single shot, or it can breach the core of a nuclear reactor, or that it's being bought up in large numbers by foreign and domestic terrorists for the purpose of crippling America and that's why it has to be banned outright!\n \n The rabid gun control fanatics have, for years, been spreading deliberate misinformation and outright lies to scare the American people into supporting tyrannical legislation that would severely curtail the rights of Americans for no reason! \n \n The head of the Violence Policy Center, on the concept of national right to carry reciprocity, said that if it became law then 16 year old gun traffickers could get Vermont carry permits and smuggle backpacks full of weapons across state lines and be untouchable by the law!\n \n Was it the NRA who, not even half an hour after the news of Virginia Tech hit the airwaves, started immediately asking people to make $32 donations (one dollar for every unarmed victim murdered)? NO! It was the Brady Campaign!\n \n Everything the NRA does has a basis in reality, they use established facts to support their position. Gun control organizations, however, will lie to the peoples' face and use scare tactics to try and frighten them into supporting their tyrannical and communistic positions for any reason. They say that concealed carry will lead to wild west shootouts over parking spaces. They say guns in parks will result in people losing their tempers and shooting at families having picnics. They say that keeping trace data out of the hands of the public will tie the hands of law enforcement and make it impossible for the police to do their job. They say that if people aren't mandated to lock up their guns in safes then your children will be killed. They say letting employees keep guns in their cars at work will encourage workplace violence and killing sprees. They say everything, except for the truth!",
