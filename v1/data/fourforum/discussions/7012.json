Why?\n \n Before you answer, take a second to actually invision that society.\n\n \n Interesting thought..... such a situation would theorectically remove the division of opinion that exists based upon the perspective of gender (ie. the pro-life religious male) and would make any difference of opinion be based on moral/philosophical considerations alone.\n \n You could argue it would shift opinion towards the mix currently held by women as everyone would be in the position of having to bear pregnancy. Given that there is a full mix of religious and other beliefs in the current day female population perhaps this would be a good analogy to such a state of being you suggest.",

   "Personally, I believe that there is a compelling argument for both. However, I believe that the tendency would be towards more pro-life. Obviously, my current pro-life bias is probably impacting this opinion, but my reasoning is fairly simple. It seems to me that one of the primary reasons women argue for pro-choice isn't so much the morals that may or may not support it, but the fact that they have been repressed by men for as long as human history records. Because of this, women see an issue that they don't believe belong in man's domain, and therefore an opportunity to circumvent his power. Thus, a pro-choice stance on abortion is a way to flex that new muscle, as well as a way to try to get themselves on the same playing field as men, by removing the possibility of a necessary labor (literally). If, however, everyone were the same sex, there would be no need to level any playing field, and there would be no new muscle to flex for any sex. No one would have anything to prove. For this reason, pro-choice fervor would have diminished before it got started in the first place, and abortion probably never would have been legalized at all. Clearly, this is all guesswork, but interesting to consider nevertheless.\n \n I guess the most interesting part is how the argument would reduce itself entirely to morality (it can be argued whether or not it currently is so). Do you think that the \"male\" in the arrangement (the one that impregnated the other) would be ignored in the decision to abort, if the world were composed of one sex? For some reason I highly doubt it.",
