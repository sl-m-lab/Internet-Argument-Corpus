   "Your characteristic method of attack on science in general (and evolution in\n particular) is to lay down a creeping barrage of bafflegab that nobody has the\n time and patience to examine and to refute. You continuously claim, despite\n every effort made to corrrect you, that scientific rationalism gives an \n inadequate and/or mistaken account of the natural world. \n \n O.K. Here's my challenge: Without hiding behind your apparatus of citations,\n \"authorities\" etc. (whether popes, bishops, saints, or early Christian fathers) \n please state in a form that even a scientist can understand, your \"proofs\" of\n the existence of God.\n \n In case you pretend that my opening remarks are just an ad hominem that\n are intended to damage you, I wish to emphasise that I intend them only\n as a description of your modus operandi.",
