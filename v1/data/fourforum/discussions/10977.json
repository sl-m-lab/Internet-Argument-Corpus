Then, I got so disgusted with him and his foreign policy that I was actually looking forward to the 2008 elections (I hate elections). Now, I have given up all hope of America being a great nation once again, since the current crop of candidates absolutely scares the poop out of me. McCain, Obama, and Clinton...ewwww.

   "Ok, I'll do it. \n \n While Bush certainly hasn't been the Reagan I was hoping for, I believe that, all told, it could have been much worse. I believe that John Kerry would have been far worse than W. ever could be. I do think we are safer now then we were before Bush, and I think the record of no attacks since 911 and the infiltration and arrest of much of the network speaks for itself. With Kerry, IMO, we'd have had an apologist, more along the lines of Chamberlain.\n \n As for the economy, I saw this coming a long time ago, with the 'housing bubble' behaving the same as the 'internet tech bubble' of the 90's. The speculation and borrowing practices (and lending practices) brought this on as well as energy prices. I'm not sure how much Bush is responsible for real estate prices. What I wish he would have done is pushed through drilling in ANWAR while there was still a Rep. majority. Furthermore, new Nuclear power plants could have helped somewhat. I do fault him for that, but in reality Bush didn't cause the RE bubble or high oil prices. Overall, we've had a great economy with record low unemployment. He's also promoted more women and minorities to higher positions than anyone else.\n \n So, I certainly wish Bush had done some things differently AND I wish he'd pushed harder on some things that didn't get done. But in my mind, it's still a question of \"Would John Kerry have been a better President than Bush?\" And I don't think that I could EVER be convinced that the douche from Mass. could ever be better than our current turd sandwich.",

Obviously it turned out to be just nother embaressing fiasco, but from a PR standpoint I thought it was very well executed. \n \n I really don't feel sorry for Bush at all. He made his descisions and went into it with eyes wide open.\n \n As far as his SS plan, it would have been great except for the fact that it would not have done anything to save SS and actually would have hastened its demise. As far as I can tell, the plan was just a (rather transparent) attempt to inflate equity markets. The drain in revenue would have moved SS's insolvency date up by about 4 years to 2013. \n \n I will agree that it MAY have been a better plan to start with, but trying to institute it when he did, when we are just a few years from the SS crisis, was just foolish. Too little too late. Like everything else Bush has done, it was jsut not based in reality.\n \n Last year, The comptroller (walker) warned us that if we did not figure out a way to cut spending and cut our debt load that by 2040 the ENTIRE federal budget would be eaten up by JUST interest payments on that debt. He made some assumptions in making that prediction that have turned out to be incorrect. First, he assumed that Bush was going to do as he promised and continue to shrink the deficit. Instead we are looking at a $400 billion deficit for next year and then roughly the same for the 2 following years. With that extra 1.2 trillion in debt, that 2040 number moves up to 2028. He also based his calculations on current treasury yields without accounting for the fact that as our economic situation worsens treasury yields will have to increase. \n \n At a 5% yield, that date moves up to 2020. At a 6.25% yield it moves up to 2018. \n \n We just do not haev the money to be instituting changes such as Bush suggested to SS. It certainly would have been good in the long term, but there IS NO long term for SS. SS cannot possibly survive long enough for it to have made a difference.",

Heck, this Congress has been even lower in a couple of polls. He's a lame duck president who happens to be in office at a time when there's a enormous amount political cynicism at Washington period. I'm not saying he's not part of the problem--he certainly IS--but I think there are other factors contributing to that rating too and people obviously disapprove of Washington all-around. And these sort of polls vary from polling group to polling group in terms of results. They are useful sometimes, but IMO you can really only put so much stock in them. heck, Bush was re-elected with an approval rating the 30s.",
