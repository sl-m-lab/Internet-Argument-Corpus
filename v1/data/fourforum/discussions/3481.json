   "Assault against life of Chechen Minister of Information and Press, Akhmed Zakaev, was committed in London. In general, Zakaev constantly expected it (beginning from the very moment of his arrival to Great Britain) and, of course, he was very afraid of it. After shock Zakaev stated that it's an act of Russian special services. He even drew a parallel between this event and \"Qatar's case\". And there is no two ways about it. Meanwhile, it has been known from an authoritative source, members of \"Youth of Albion\" (British young people' organization of anti-Muslim orientation) have taken a very great interest in Zakaev's persona lately. Its leaders repeatedly called for clearing Great Britain of Muslims, Negroes and other sorts of \"monsters\". As became known from the same source, the activity of this organization was supported by some Members of Blair's Cabinet, and it's exactly this organization that assumed responsibility for attempt on Zakaev's life. What is more, its members stressed that they would stop at nothing in their strivings after Zakaev's murder. They consider \"he hugs Muslim terrorists, because he is one of their leaders\". Really, we will have no fears for Zakaev as well as for all of us, if Blair plucks up his courage and grants his extradition to Russia.",
