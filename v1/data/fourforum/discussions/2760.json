   "This mainly applies to the people who live in Britain, (as far as I know, Americans and Europeans are blessed with a local income tax rather than this extortionate tax), but reply anyway\n \n The question is this: Given the Chancellor's spending plans, which means that council tax could rise by about 6% every year, do you think the end result will be a repeat of the poll tax riots under Thatcher? \n Personally, I think that at the moment, the pressure is still being held, but if people start getting put out of their homes, then things will get violent.\n We all know it's an unfair tax, but what wil the results be?",

   "I can't really see it getting as bad as the Poll Tax riots. The Problem of poll tax was the fact that it in essence shifted the tax burden from the rich to the poor, hence the massive unrest over it. Council tax may be unfair, but it's not that unfair. And of course one of the most hit social groups are pensioners, who aren't generally the type to go round rioting anyway.\n \n Personally I believe a switch to local income tax is inevitable, and while no doubt will be preceded by massive demonstration, I seriously doubt anything too nasty. I just hope the change comes sooner rather than later.",
