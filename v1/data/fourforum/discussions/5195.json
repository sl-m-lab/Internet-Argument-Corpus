   "OK. I understand your argument: but does that mean you would support protectionist measures to prevent the export of jobs ? As I suggested before, protectionism might do more harm than good to the protected parts of an economy : What do you think ?\n\n \n I agree. Protectionism against imports of goods and services is a bad way to go. Not only is it questionable wether it would be possible to slow the capital flight this way, but it is also very vulnrable for being hi-jacked by special interest groups and could threaten to set off a domino chain of protektionism (think 1930:ies). \n \n Besides, the root of the problem is capital moving, not goods and services (which ios good for almost everyone involved). I don`t know if the Tobin tax (taxation of capital movements) is possible (not even \"Tobin\" himself believed in it), but perhaps it could be used if both EU, USA and China (fat chance..)would implement it.\n \n Another way could perhaps be to try to raise consumer awareness of working conditions in second- and third world countries. And hopefully this would result in shifts of preferences, killing two birds with one stone (slowing the capital movements from the West as well as improve working conditions in the third world). The price for this would perhaps be more expensive goods and services as well as lower profits for multinational companies (alternatively raise unemployment and/or lower wages in the third world). \n \n For europes part, much of the capital flight is going to eastern europe. Hopefully wages and working conditions will converge as many of the eastern european countries are growing quite fast (but by the current rate of growth it will still take at least 50 years for the fastest growing economies I think). By expanding EU eastwards, we could both quicken this process of convergance as well as encourage labour force migration (which will both quicken the convergance as well as benefit the labour force rather than the capital owners). Another aspect of this is that we could create the basis for a unified european labour movement that could protect european countries from the \"race to the bottom\", at least against eachother.\n \n Sorry for the late reply.",

But there have been a few national and international movements towards the direction of consumer preferences caring more and more about the production process. Inhumane treatment of animals and enviromental concerns have become an important factor among western consumers in just a decade (or two). At least among the middle/upper class. A two-tier system certainly makes this plan or theory much harder to implement.\n \n It would include both propaganda through the public educational system (I mean, at least it should be of some use) as well as mainstream media.

You repeat \"supply and demand\", and then pick one factor or the other when it suits you.\n \n Nevertheless, this is entirely beside the point. You have simply used the issue of oil to avoid discussing the topic.\n \n I would also like to note at this juncture, that our previous discussion you refer to, ended with you being unable to answer a simple question, namely:\n \nhow do you account for the discrepancy in the change in cost of oil in US dollars vs the cost of oil in Australian, New Zealand or Canadian dollars, or in Euros?\n",

   "What in the hell are you talking about? Are you off your meds today?\n\n \n He's not. What Georged said should be able to be easily understood by anyone who has fianance and economics background. \n \n Not really a difficult job in the US when over 80% of the GDP is driven by public debt and consumer spending greatly facilitated by personal debt; internal transactions.\n \n Most of the GDP is funded by personal debt. The average debt in the US is over $46,000. Our MPC is ridiculous highly, meaning that for every dollar we earn, we save a paltry amount of it. As such, personal debt will obvious expand when the crunch comes every so often. Normally in a rational society, people don't spend like that, and we saw that post 9/11 with a wait and see attitude. GDP is dependent upon consumer confidence. If consumer confidence drops, then the GDP drops as seen post 9/11 and during Bush Sr's 1991-1992 campagin. Consumer confidence really has no stable foundation. Such is the problem with relying upon it for GDP growth.",

   " Consumer confidence really has no stable foundation. Such is the problem with relying upon it for GDP growth.\n\n \n The present administration has a lot of balls in the air. Positive consumer confidence is a key component of their economic policy. When a GDP with the composition we've criminally structured is threatened, using fear to expand public and personal spending has a finite period of success. Siege euphoria from 9/11 and Iraq is wearing off, consumer confidence is drooping, leaving the administration with three choices; improve the economy by conventional methods trying to use a badly broken, unrepairable at this stage manufacturing sector, expand the active war effort for another temporary fix or bite the bullet and take the economic hit to reduce the standard of living. That's how important consumer confidence is to the US economy. Any guesses?",
