   "Lurch, I have seen your posts and can tell you are a pretty smart guy so I wanted to ask you a question. This doesn't really fit into evolution, I know, but I would like some info on it. Keep in mind that I believe evolution is true and I believe in God (not the bible since it was written by man). Anyway, I saw something pro creationism that said that granite is a genisis rock and cannot be reproduced or something like that. It also said something like even the lava or magma that hardens will never be able to form granite only a rock very similar to granite (forgot the name) and Granite cannot be melted and then hardened back into granite only the rock that is similar. Their argument was that since granite cannot be reproduced in any of these ways it would have had to be created as is, solid, and not molten rock. I was wondering if you or anyone else for that matter has an explanation for this. Thanks for any info.",

   "Nifty question. But I'm not a geologist and really don't know much about it. BUT I have passed the question along to a geologist that I know.\n \n However, I can tell you that lava will not form granite because it isn't the correct composition. Lava is a mafic (mineral rich, especially iron) igneous rock. It forms rock that is known as basalt and gabbro. The plates that form the ocean floors are basalt and gabbro. They average about 6 km in thickness. The continental crust is much thicker than the oceanic plates. It goes higher and it goes deeper. The continental plates average 30 to 35 km thick but extends down some 65 km under mountain ranges. Two layers can be distinguished although there is no distinct boundry between them. The lower layer is also mafic (basaltic) rock while the upper layer is called felsic rock, composed of granite (feldspars and quartz) and diorite (pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite). Basalt usually has a density < 3.0 grams per cubic cm. while ghe felsic rocks are less that 3.0 grams/cubic cm.\n \n If you remember that below the mantel the earth is molten. Essentially the crust is floating on the liquid inner earth. I'm sure that you know that less dense things float better than dense things. A long time ago the granite floated to the top. It is very old.\n \n So pointing to the mantle and claiming that granite can't form from it is a bit like pointing to a bottle of milk with the cream separated on top and claiming that God created the cream since it isn't forming any more.",

   "Answer is back for geology prof.\n \nBasically, there is an old 'problem' called the granite problem that refers space issues related to granite formation. Actually, in terms of the chemistry forming granite is no problem. Rhyolite is an extrusive form of granite. It is identical in chemistry and composition to a granite and has been observed to erupt and cool in our time. Granite cooled slowly and formed larger crystals, but no one can claim that you cannot 'get' a granite. Furthermore, we have good geochronologic evidence documenting the time it takes for granite to cool. I don't know what this guy is getting at, but perhaps he's confused two separate issues related to granite formation.\n\n OK. So the original assertion is wrong. No debunking of my speculation but no confirmation either (except the implied statement that [most] granite is old).",

   "Here's more.\n \n New ideas on granite formation \n \n Another opinion.\n \n Earth's continental land masses created in short, fast bursts \n \n That's kinda what I had in mind. The Greenland granite is very old, by the way.\n \n Here's the abstract to the article in nature that the story above is based upon. If you have access to Nature, you can look this up.\n \n Granite magma formation, transport and emplacement in the Earth's crust  \n \n But even worse for the initial argument is that creationist organizations like AIG do not argue that granite was created by God, but they argue for it's rapid formation. But still, even the paper on fast granite formation above is bad news for creationists. It proposes between 1,000 and 100,000 years - and it takes a long time for granite to cool.

   "This answer to the question poses an interesting question at the bottom.\n \nfrom a poster named Calzaer on another board:\n \n Granite is an intrusive, felsic igneous rock formed by relatively slow cooling and crystalization of magma. It's made of primarily k-spar and quartz, with a bit of muscovite mica, and smaller quantities of biotite mica and amphibole. It certainly takes a long time to crystalize, which is why it's intrusive rather than extrusive, but to say magma will *never* form into it again is a completely daft statement. It takes just as long to form granite now as it did back in the cenozoic. \n \n Quoting from my textbook:\n \nPartial melting is another process by which magmas of more than once composition can form. As rocks undergo partial melting, the early-formed (low-temperature) magma [the stuff that's close to being granite - Cal] may rise (due to convection) or otherwise separate from the solid portion of the rocks to produce a body of felsic magma [the stuff required for granite to form - Cal]. At higher temperatures, however, the remaining portions of the rocks may melt to produce a higher-temperature magma of intermediate composition. This is one way to explain how granitic magmas [magmas that produce granite - Cal] can evolve from a subducting mass of seafloor basalt\n\n In short, granite is being formed RIGHT NOW.\n \n Although, to be fair, the distinction between granite and porphoritic rhyolite sometimes seems subjective... but if this person (who whoever this person is parroting) really knew enough about geology to be confident in this statement, they'd be claiming PEGMATITE as the genesis rock, since it has to cool even slower than granite. If granite is a genesis rock, how the hell could pegmatite exist??\n\n So felsic magma rises, but not for the reasons I said. Oh well. I was kind of picturing an effect like the one that causes slag to come to the top when smelting iron.",
