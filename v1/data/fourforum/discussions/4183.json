   "not exaclty news since we have all been expecting it.\n \n http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20050127-031150-6013r.htm\n \n \nDavos, Switzerland, Jan. 27 (UPI) -- A top Chinese economist says the U.S. dollar is not a stable currency, and China's first priority is to adopt a more flexible basket of currencies. \n \n Fan Gang, director of the National Economic Research Institute at the China Reform Foundation, was speaking Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n \n China's yuan is currently restricted to a narrow band around 8.28 yuan to $1. Fan said the yuan should be pegged to a more \"manageable\" basket including euros, yen and dollars. \n \n \"The U.S. dollar is no longer -- in our opinion is no longer -- (seen) as a stable currency and is devaluating all the time, and that's putting troubles all the time,\" Fan said, speaking in English, according to the official Xinhua news agency. \n \n The dollar hit a new low in December against the euro and has been falling against other major currencies amid concerns about U.S. trade and budget deficits. \n \n China last year resisted international pressure to revalue its currency, and Fan stressed that the Chinese government was not responding to pressure, Xinhua said.\n \n \"Now people understand the U.S. dollar will not stop devaluating,\" he said.\n\n \n There are a few more articles about it out there. They are planning to discuss it at the G7 summit.\n \n for those who don't follow such things, the yuan has been pegged to the dollar for years. That means that its value is basically set by the value of the dollar. It is generally considered to be undervalued (the yuan that is, not the dollar). \n \n The problem with unpegging the yuan from the dollar is that it has been floating the dollar. By attaching the yuan to the dollar, the yuan has added perceived value to the dollar, basically keeping the dollar out of absolute free fall in the face of our huge deficits and public and private debt.\n \n For those who do follow such things, I probably don't have to tell you it may be a good idea to have your currency broker on the phone during the G7 conference, and have orders in to go long on anything BUT the dollar.\n \n Anyone care to guess as to how long it will be before we are quoting the yen as JPY/USD?",

   "How China will peg the Yuan remains to be seen. China has already announced they'll continue to observe prudent fiscal policies and letting the Yuan bury the dollar, as it would, is not in their best trade interest. With Gang stating the US dollar will not stop devaluing, this could be a very interesting basket. I wonder what's going through the minds of Bush and Snow. Their policy has always been letting the dollar slide to 'improve US trade competitiveness', as if abnormal deficits and trade imbalances gave them a choice.",

Their policy has always been letting the dollar slide to 'improve US trade competitiveness', as if abnormal deficits and trade imbalances gave them a choice.\n\n \n It will certainly be interesting to see what comes of it all. I have heard some rumors that there has been talk of a flexible, fully convertible yuan by 2007.\n \n As far as Bush and Snow, their public line seems to be \"this will lower the current account deficit\". Frankly, I am a little skeptical about this, since that will largely depend on exactly how far the dollar slides. This is not like the old days, when we started with raw materials and turned out finished goods. It is a brave new world. We do not even produce tool steel anymore, nor is there a US manufacturer left that produces nuts and bolts in country (large scale, anyway. There are still some specialty companies out there doing short runs). \n \n If the worst were to happen, and they pegged it (the yuan) and a basket of currencies that does not include the dollar, I think it would be a dead heat as far as short term effect. When the dollar slides, our prices certainly look more competitive, but we have to raise them in order to pay our overseas suppliers. long term effects are, I think, obvious enough that we don't have to get into them here.\n \n From the statements from the bush administration, I can only think of 3 possibilities behind their line of thinking.\n \n 1-They do not understand what the problem is (a hint to Mr Bush, the problem is NOT that the dollar is overvalued)\n 2-There is, somewhere, huge amounts of on hand stocks waiting to be sold, and after those phantom goods are sold, a fairy godmother is going to come down and wave a wand and turn the dollar into a high value currency again\n 3-We are trying to inflate away the national debt. At the rate we are going, in ten years, a trillion dollars will be right on par with the price of a new Chevy. At that point, the debt is chump change.",

The price difference is not that great, but it is a LOT more truck for the money. \n \n You are about right on the cost, though. I remember when pickup trucks were cheap transportation.

In the end I couldn't justify the expense of replacing a nearly new truck.\n \n I bought mine because I routinely pull a horse trailer, haul hay (since nobody around here seems willing to deliver and stack it for you), haul whatever machine tool treasures I happen across for my home shop, and because there are a couple of places between the house and town where everytime it rains, the road is covered with 3 ft of water (a fact we were oblivious to when we bought the house). With a snorkel, I know that F450 will go with water well over the hood, and the cab doesn't even leak. \n \n I, too, got the 4 door at the wifes insistence (she is living in some fantasy land where we will someday take the children on a horseback trek in the mountains......it may happen someday, but probably not during the life of this truck). Certainly the last bargain in the US automotive market.\n \n I think an exception needs to be make for minivans as well. We bought a new minivan 3 weeks ago for when we take driving vacations (weekend jaubts to the ozarks or to grandmas house)with the kids. US minivans are miles ahead of similar import offerings. While the price is competitive, they are much improved in the engineering and amenities department.\n \n I agree that only a fool would buy a US made passenger car.",
