   "US Senator John McCain Says the US is Founded on Christianity!\n Presidential hopeful US Senator John McCain said in an interview with beliefnet.com that the United States of America was set up by the US Constitution to be a Christian nation! Here is the question and McCain's absurd and incorrect answer: \"A recent poll found that 55 percent of Americans believe the U.S. Constitution establishes a Christian nation. What do you think?\"\n \n \"I would probably have to say yes, that the Constitution established the United States of America as a Christian nation. But I say that in the broadest sense. The lady that holds her lamp beside the golden door doesn't say, \"I only welcome Christians.\" We welcome the poor, the tired, the huddled masses. But when they come here they know that they are in a nation founded on Christian principles.\"\n \n Of course, anyone who is familiar with American history knows McCain is mistaken. Since he's a very well educated man, it appears that he knows differently but wants to win votes.\n \n America was NOT founded on Christianity at all! The Declaration of Independence is a Deistic document because it only refers to God in Deistic terms, such as Nature's God, and that it NEVER mentions Jesus or the Bible. The Constitution doesn't mention God at all and neither does it refer to Jesus, the Bible, Moses or any Judeo-Christian personality or book. If McCain was correct in his statement that the US Constitution established the US as a Christian nation, why doesn't it not only NOT state that, but it doesn't even mention Christianity at all with the exception of the date which is simply the writing style of the time?\n \n And then there is the Treaty of Tripoli. This US treaty was originated in the administration of George Washington and ratified in the administration of John Adams. Article 11 of the treaty plainly states, \"As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion . . .\" How could the founders have made it any more clear???\n As the interviewer pointed out in their question to McCain, 55 percent of Americans believe the lie that America was founded as a Christian nation. This is a common belief which is not correct.",

   "Fellow peasants,\n \n I was rather convinced that it would be difficult to demonstrate Christian principles in the founding of the US other than vague notions about \"providence\", etc. I have had my view changed after reading an interesting Library of Congress exhibit, the link to which is provided below. \n \n http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/ Reference section IV particularly.\n \n Quoting from the above:\n \n On July 4, 1776, Congress appointed Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams \"to bring in a device for a seal for the United States of America.\" Franklin's proposal adapted the biblical story of the parting of the Red Sea (left). Jefferson first recommended the \"Children of Israel in the Wilderness, led by a Cloud by Day, and a Pillar of Fire by night. . . .\" He then embraced Franklin's proposal and rewrote it (right). Jefferson's revision of Franklin's proposal was presented by the committee to Congress on August 20. Although not accepted these drafts reveal the religious temper of the Revolutionary period. Franklin and Jefferson were among the most theologically liberal of the Founders, yet they used biblical imagery for this important task.\n \n Congress proclaimed days of fasting and of thanksgiving annually throughout the Revolutionary War. This proclamation by Congress set May 17, 1776, as a \"day of Humiliation, Fasting and Prayer\" throughout the colonies. Congress urges its fellow citizens to \"confess and bewail our manifold sins and transgressions, and by a sincere repentance and amendment of life, appease his [God's] righteous displeasure, and through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, obtain his pardon and forgiveness.\" \n \n Congress set December 18, 1777, as a day of thanksgiving on which the American people \"may express the grateful feelings of their hearts and consecrate themselves to the service of their divine benefactor\" and on which they might \"join the penitent confession of their manifold sins . . . that it may please God, through the merits of Jesus Christ, mercifully to forgive and blot them out of remembrance.\" \n \n I really don't think it terribly shocking that a bunch of white folks from 18th century Europe would be predisposed to Christianity vs any other faiths. Nor do I believe that such predisposition in any way impacts our present vision of what the gubment should or should not do. Sure the gubment was founded on Christian principles. The question is - so what? One might also note that the founders all wore breeches and wigs. I doubt that folks would use the same logic to suggest we conform to their dress code.",

   "I'm noticing that these dates are all pre-Constitution.\n\n \n Well then, please enjoy the following references which post date the constitution. If one considers the Christian bent of the founders prior to and following the constitution it is no small leap of reason to hypothesize that these same values were held at the TIME of the constitution. Consider:\n \n That religion was not otherwise addressed in the Constitution did not make it an \"irreligious\" document any more than the Articles of Confederation was an \"irreligious\" document. The Constitution dealt with the church precisely as the Articles had, thereby maintaining, at the national level, the religious status quo. In neither document did the people yield any explicit power to act in the field of religion. But the absence of expressed powers did not prevent either the Continental-Confederation Congress or the Congress under the Constitution from sponsoring a program to support general, nonsectarian religion. \n \n In his Farewell Address, the first president advised his fellow citizens that \"Religion and morality\" were the \"great Pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of Men and citizens.\" \"National morality,\" he added, could not exist \"in exclusion of religious principle.\" \"Virtue or morality,\" he concluded, as the products of religion, were \"a necessary spring of popular government.\" The \"religion section\" is located in the lower right portion of page one and continues to the upper right portion of page two. \n \n John Adams, a self-confessed \"church going animal,\" grew up in the Congregational Church in Braintree, Massachusetts. By the time he wrote this letter his theological position can best be described as Unitarian. In this letter Adams tells Jefferson that \"Without Religion this World would be Something not fit to be mentioned in polite Company, I mean Hell.\" (letter dated 1817)\n \n John Adams continued the practice, begun in 1775 and adopted under the new federal government by Washington, of issuing fast and thanksgiving day proclamations. In this proclamation, issued at a time when the nation appeared to be on the brink of a war with France, Adams urged the citizens to \"acknowledge before God the manifold sins and transgressions with which we are justly chargeable as individuals and as a nation; beseeching him at the same time, of His infinite grace, through the Redeemer of the World, freely to remit all our offences, and to incline us, by His Holy Spirit, to that sincere repentance and reformation which may afford us reason to hope for his inestimable favor and heavenly benediction.\" (Date March 1798)\n \n It is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809) and of James Madison (1809-1817) the state became the church. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the House--a practice that continued until after the Civil War--were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.) As early as January 1806 a female evangelist, Dorothy Ripley, delivered a camp meeting-style exhortation in the House to Jefferson, Vice President Aaron Burr, and a \"crowded audience.\" Throughout his administration Jefferson permitted church services in executive branch buildings. The Gospel was also preached in the Supreme Court chambers.\n Jefferson's actions may seem surprising because his attitude toward the relation between religion and government is usually thought to have been embodied in his recommendation that there exist \"a wall of separation between church and state.\" In that statement, Jefferson was apparently declaring his opposition, as Madison had done in introducing the Bill of Rights, to a \"national\" religion. In attending church services on public property, Jefferson and Madison consciously and deliberately were offering symbolic support to religion as a prop for republican government. \n \n In the 1790s, Thomas Jefferson, influenced by the writings of Joseph Priestly, seems to have adopted a more positive opinion of Christianity. In this letter to his friend Benjamin Rush, Jefferson asserted that he was a \"Christian, in the only sense in which [Jesus] wished any one to be.\" In an attached syllabus, Jefferson compared the \"merit of the doctrines of Jesus\" with those of the classical philosophers and the Jews. Jefferson pronounced Jesus' doctrines, though \"disfigured by the corruptions of schismatising followers\" far superior to any competing system. Jefferson declined to consider the \"question of [Jesus] being a member of the god-head, or in direct communication with it, claimed for him by some of his followers, and denied by others.\"\n \n Clearly the founders were religious men. But again...so what? They were also powder wig wearing slave owners with wooden teeth.",

Peace and/or compromise in the Middle East goes against god's will according to my \"born again\" neighbors! \n God (If there was one) forbid that we should have a President who puts his religion before common sense! Although we may have one in the White House at present????\n I do believe that if the Puritans had their way, the bible would have been the cornerstone of our constitution just as the Koran is in Iran. But, our forefathers had the good sense to realize the importance of the separation of Church and State. \n Who really cares on what principals our country was founded on? ... As long as we have freedom of all religions and the freedom not to believe and a very wide divide between church and state. Politicians must leave their personal beliefs (Be it Christian, Jew, Muslim, etc.) at the door when they make decisions on behalf of the people.",

   "This article, heavily resourced, pretty much puts an end to the argument: http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/farrell_till/myth.html\n \n Excerpts:\nFundamentalist Christians are currently working overtime to convince the American public that the founding fathers intended to establish this country on \"biblical principles,\" but history simply does not support their view. The men mentioned above and others who were instrumental in the founding of our nation were in no sense Bible-believing Christians. Thomas Jefferson, in fact, was fiercely anti-cleric. In a letter to Horatio Spafford in 1814, Jefferson said, \"In every country and every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot, abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own. It is easier to acquire wealth and power by this combination than by deserving them, and to effect this, they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon, unintelligible to all mankind, and therefore the safer for their purposes\" (George Seldes, The Great Quotations, Secaucus, New Jersey Citadel Press, 1983, p. 371). In a letter to Mrs. Harrison Smith, he wrote, \"It is in our lives, and not from our words, that our religion must be read. By the same test the world must judge me. But this does not satisfy the priesthood. They must have a positive, a declared assent to all their interested absurdities. My opinion is that there would never have been an infidel, if there had never been a priest\" (August 6, 1816). \n \n Jefferson was just as suspicious of the traditional belief that the Bible is \"the inspired word of God.\" He rewrote the story of Jesus as told in the New Testament and compiled his own gospel version known as The Jefferson Bible, which eliminated all miracles attributed to Jesus and ended with his burial. The Jeffersonian gospel account contained no resurrection, a twist to the life of Jesus that was considered scandalous to Christians but perfectly sensible to Jefferson's Deistic mind. In a letter to John Adams, he wrote, \"To talk of immaterial existences is to talk of nothings. To say that the human soul, angels, God, are immaterial is to say they are nothings, or that there is no God, no angels, no soul. I cannot reason otherwise\" (August 15, 1820). In saying this, Jefferson was merely expressing the widely held Deistic view of his time, which rejected the mysticism of the Bible and relied on natural law and human reason to explain why the world is as it is. Writing to Adams again, Jefferson said, \"And the day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter\" (April 11, 1823). These were hardly the words of a devout Bible-believer.\n \n Jefferson didn't just reject the Christian belief that the Bible was \"the inspired word of God\"; he rejected the Christian system too. In Notes on the State of Virginia, he said of this religion, \"There is not one redeeming feature in our superstition of Christianity. It has made one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites\" (quoted by newspaper columnist William Edelen, \"Politics and Religious Illiteracy,\" Truth Seeker, Vol. 121, No. 3, p. 33). Anyone today who would make a statement like this or others we have quoted from Jefferson's writings would be instantly branded an infidel, yet modern Bible fundamentalists are frantically trying to cast Jefferson in the mold of a Bible believing Christian. They do so, of course, because Jefferson was just too important in the formation of our nation to leave him out if Bible fundamentalists hope to sell their \"Christian-nation\" claim to the public. Hence, they try to rewrite history to make it appear that men like Thomas Jefferson had intended to build our nation on \"biblical principles.\" The irony of this situation is that the Christian leaders of Jefferson's time knew where he stood on \"biblical principles,\" and they fought desperately, but unsuccessfully, to prevent his election to the presidency.\nJames Madison, Jefferson's close friend and political ally, was just as vigorously opposed to religious intrusions into civil affairs as Jefferson was. In 1785, when the Commonwealth of Virginia was considering passage of a bill \"establishing a provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion,\" Madison wrote his famous \"Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments\" in which he presented fifteen reasons why government should not be come involved in the support of any religion. This paper, long considered a landmark document in political philosophy, was also cited in the majority opinion in Lee vs. Weisman. The views of Madison and Jefferson prevailed in the Virginia Assembly, and in 1786, the Assembly adopted the statute of religious freedom of which Jefferson and Madison were the principal architects. The preamble to this bill said that \"to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical.\" The statute itself was much more specific than the establishment clause of the U. S. Constitution \"Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly, That no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in nowise [sic] diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities\".\n \n Realizing that whatever legislation an elected assembly passed can be later repealed, Jefferson ended the statute with a statement of contempt for any legislative body that would be so presumptuous \"And though we well know this Assembly, elected by the people for the ordinary purposes of legislation only, have no power to restrain the acts of succeeding assemblies, constituted with the powers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act irrevocable, would be of no effect in law, yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present or to narrow its operation, such act will be an infringement of natural right\" .\n",
