Now 70% of new machine tools purchased in the US come from China. They said the same thing about chinese electronics. They believed that people would continue to buy higher quality brands rather than switch to no name chinese brands. Nearly half of our electronics are now produced in China.\n \n IMO the move by the Chinese automakers reflects their opinion regarding our economy and the direction our standard of living is likely to take. Automobiles in North America are expesvie, with even \"basic\" models carrying options that are considered luxury options in much of the world. \n \n If you consider the likely cost of production of a \"basic\" automobile, it is likely that the chinese could produce a reliable, quality automobile with just the basics not only for less than $10,000, but likely less than $5,000.\n \n I am not talking a camry here, but more along the lines of something like a Geo storm basic model. Engines and drive train components (transmissions, gear sets, etc...) are less than half the cost from a chinese supplier than from anywhere else. For example, I just bought an inline gearbox for a robotics project. The cheapest price I could find anywhere was $400. The chinese model was $102 and carried a 5 year warranty.",

Their domestic electronics market is not particularly profitable either, nor is their machine market. China is very much export driven and, IMO, they have a greater understanding of US markets than US companies do. The Chinese seem to recognize the competitve edge that they have when marketing to a declining economy. When they started building VCR's, only 2% of their production was sold on their domestic market. The rest went straight to Wal Mart shelves. The american consumer is becoming very price conscious.\n \n I don't think it will be a major issue until 2010, when chinese domestic sales reach 10 million units per year (projected). At that point China will have developed the parts infrastructure to support a full export industry.\n \n Have you seen the chinese made SUV that Bricklin proposes to sell? It is made by Chery and people are comparing it to the BMW X3.....but it is $15,000 cheaper. \n \n While I doubt there is much for the Japanese to worry about yet, it should make the US Automakers sweat.",
