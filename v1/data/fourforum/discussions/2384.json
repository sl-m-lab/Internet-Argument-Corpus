   "Note: The inspiration for this thread came from a great blog I've been reading lately: http://www.justinbuist.org/blog/\n \n This is House Resolutoin 627 of the 108th Congress It is a rather simple bill that would condemn the abuse of Iraqi prisoners (committed by seven troops, thus far), while at the same time commend the 130,000 or so American soldiers doing their duty of service to their country, and doing it well. This bill seems rather non-controversial, does it not? emoticon_xchicken \n \n Well, Representative Fortney \"Pete\" Stark, of the 13th Congressional District, voted against the resolution. A soldier who fought in Iraq wrote Mr. Stark a letter about his \"NO\" vote on the resolution:\n \n Pete Stark\n House of Representatives\n 239 Cannon HOB\n Washington D.C. 20515\n \n Dear Mr. Stark,\n \n I am appalled that you voted against today's House Resolution 627, Roll Number 150. This measure would have shown publicly that you condemn the abuse of the prisoners in Iraq while simultaneously commend the service of the fine men and women who are serving in Iraq that bring honor to the uniform that they wear and to the Nation that they serve.\n \n There are many Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen and Coastguardmen from your 13th Congressional District who are serving with pride and distinction . These men and women bring great credit upon their hometowns and the State of California.\n \n Your \"NO\" vote is an indication that you do not support the troops who selflessly serve our nation and in many cases have given the ultimate sacrifice so that you might have the freedom that you enjoy as a citizen of this great Nation. Further, your \"NO\" vote on this resolution is a disgrace to the people of this district who have elected you.\n \n I urge you to stop your contemptuous display of bitter partisanship and your politicization of this War. Your actions are very divisive and destructive to the morale of our troops and the morale of our nation. I know that a majority of the population of the 13th Congressional District are very strong in their support of our soldiers and in their support of the War in iraq. Your \"NO\" vote today reflects that you are way out of touch with the people of this district.\n \n Very Sincerely,\n \n Daniel L. Dow\n \n .. This letter seems rather professional, with no personal attacks, and makes a strong point, it seems. It is merely the expressed concern of a voting constituent of Mr. Stark's. Now take a look at Mr. Stark's response, which was left on Daniel Dow's answering machine. It is transcribed below:\n \n Dan, this is Congressman Pete Stark and I just got your fax and you don't know what you're talking about. So, if you care about enlisted people you wouldn't have voted for that thing either -- but probably somebody put you up to this and uhm, I'm not sure who it was but I thought if you could spell half the words in the letter that somebody wrote it for you. So, I don't pay much attention to it but I'll call you back later and let you tell me more about why you think you're such a great XXXXXXned hero and why you think that this general and the Defense Department who forced these poor enlisted guys to do what they did shouldn't be held to account. That's the issue. So, if you want to stick it to a bunch of enlisted guys have your way. But, if you want to get to the bottom of the people who forced this awful program -- in --- Iraq, then you should understand more about it than you obviously do. Thanks.\n \n Does that seem harsh, crazy, stupid, and just plain nuts or what?? Why would any congressman treat a constituent this way, especially when the constituent has done nothing to deserve it. \"...tell me more about why you think you're such a great XXXXXXned hero...\" To me, this is just plain rude, wrong, and needs to be shared. Hopefully people will stop electing jerks like this. I won't even go in to his voting record... :xbanghead \n \n Ryan",

   "As far as his voting against the bill and receiving a letter from a constituent who expressed his disappointment, there is no singling out there. Unless it is \"singling out\" to ever question the decisions of our masters in Congress.\n \n But as far as my posting Stark's response to that letter, I did not do it because he is a Democrat ,but because I have worked for him in the past and am upset and disappointed in how he treated one of his constituents. It was a wrong and nasty way to respond, and I would be upset whether he were Democrat, Republican, or American Nazi Party member. I don't know of any others Congressmen who responded as badly to one of their constituents and were foolish enough to do so in a way that recorded it (on an answering machine). I would single anyone out who responds to constituents in this way, and I'm especially mad about it because I worked for Stark in Washington, and he was a nice man, so it bugs me to see/hear him act this way.\n \n Ryan",
