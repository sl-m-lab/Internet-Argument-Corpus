I discovered Tupac and really like him, particularly \"Keep Ya Head Up\" and \"Brenda's Got a Baby.\" I like Nas' \"I Can\" and Kanye West's \"Jesus Walks\" but haven't heard anything else by them. Basically, I'm looking for other good rap that people can recommend to me. I don't care as much about the production side of things, I care more about the lyric and sound of the rapper himself. I suppose that's reflected in the Tupac stuff that I like and in the fact that I like freestyle and some early rap that I've heard. So, any recommendations? Let me know songs and artists so I know where to specifically look.",
