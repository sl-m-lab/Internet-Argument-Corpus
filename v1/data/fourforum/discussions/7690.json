Matt Blunt's office to see where he stands on the resolution, but he has yet to respond.\n\n \n \n Is this a challenge to the Incorporation Doctrine? Will the Alito/Roberts/Thomas team endorse this? \n \n Something tells me this is unconstituional and would be struck down by the Supreme Court, but you never know in these new times (the end times?)...",

   "The bill, while IMO unconstitutional, is also pointless. The majority, as well as any minority religion, already has the right to express their religous opinions. Why would anyone waste time and money to write and legislate such a bill, when all it does is reiterate what's already in the US constitution and judicial precedent?\n \n There is also no need whatsoever for a state government to recognize that a greater power exists. \n Since the bill also purportedly contains laguage that says that Christianity is the only religion to deserve justified recognition, it is very troubling to us Pastafarians, who in Missouri, might need to move further underground than even today. O may the mighty Noodly Meaty One deliver us from this persecution.",
