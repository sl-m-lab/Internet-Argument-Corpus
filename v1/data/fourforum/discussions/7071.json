   "Well, despite what the all the anti's and naysayers say about Iraqis not really wanting democracy, it appears they DO want to vote and take it pretty seriously. \n From the main CNN page: \"Iraqis turned out in droves to pick a 275-member parliament today, with the once-reluctant Sunni Arabs streaming to the polls. Turnout was apparently so heavy across the country that election officials kept the polls open for an extra hour to accommodate Iraqis exercising their democratic rights.\"From the story:\"There were early signs Sunni Arab voters were choosing to embrace the political process. The turnout appeared steady and brisk in some Sunni-dominated areas.\"\n \n A celebratory atmosphere took hold in some locations. In the eastern Ramadi neighborhood of Sufiya, candy was being handed out, as people came to vote. Khalilzad said that people arrived to polls with families \"almost like going to a wedding.\"\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/12/15/iraq.elections/index.html\n \n Gee, no bombings of voting stations. No sky falling. No end of the Iraqi civilization. What will the anti-war people do now? They've lost a key part of their message about Iraq: that Iraqis really don't want what America is making possible for them.",

Noooo they just all hate americans and want to blow us up.\n\n \n \n I am a very positive person, always looking for the bright side. Sometimes there IS no bright side.\n \n We have been taking steps since the 60's to ensure that Iran and Iraq do not become to friendly. The last thing we want is a superstate in the ME, especially not one run by islamic fundamentalist. Thats what we are going to have now.\n \n The US is threatening Iran with military force...Iraq just signed a mutual defense treaty with them.\n \n The US is threatening Iran with sanctions....Iraq just signed a trade agreement with them guaranteeing that they would allow free trade regardless of external pressure.\n \n We are now little more than a toothless dog int he ME running around growling at people out of habit. We have no ability to take any measures against Iran at this point without dragging Iraq into it. The two are in bed together and military action and trade sanctions are now off the table.

No one ever said they wouldn't vote. Of course they'll vote. They voted under Saddam, they're voting now.
