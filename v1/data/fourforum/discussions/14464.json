   "Isolationism is a foreign policy which combines a non-interventionist military policy and a political policy of economic nationalism (protectionism).\n\n \n Since when? The countries of Europe (namely Spain and England/Britain) from the 15th to the 19th century followed mercantilism, i.e., economic nationalism while at the same time they were conquering the New World and routinely trying to interfere with each other's internal affairs (due to religious differences and the fact that they were both trying to conquer the New World). \n \n \nNon-interventionism - Political rulers should avoid entangling alliances with other nations and avoid all wars not related to direct territorial self-defense.\n\n \n For most of our national history the U.S. has had a protectionist trade policy. But during this time we fought an undeclared naval war with France in the 1790s and then fought the War of 1812 (when we had not theretofore been invaded). Then we issued the Monroe Doctrine telling Europe to stay out of the New World before we conquered half of Mexico before going to war with Spain over Cuba and ended up taking over Puerto Rico and the Phillpines. \n \n \nProtectionism - There should be legal barriers to control trade and cultural exchange with people in other states. \n\n \n Economic protectionism has nothing to do with imposing barriers to cultural exchange. While the U.S. had a protectionist economic policy we sent a naval expedition to Japan in order to expose Japan to America's ways of doing things. \n \n \nLibertarians favour removing tariffs and other barriers to trade and cultural exchange, and are therefore opposed to \"isolationism\".\n\n \n Again, you don't understand the true meaning of isolationism.\n \n Platform | Libertarian Party\n \n \"We would end the current U.S. government policy of foreign intervention,\n including military and economic aid.\"\n \n \n I just noticed your spelling of favor. Are you even an American?",
