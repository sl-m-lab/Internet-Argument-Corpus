   "There's a few good points made about this in the Education thread. I'd like to bring it here as well, because, after all, it does involve one's health.\n \n They use it for ADD (like everyone knows), but from what I've looked up, I've found that it's more potent that cocaine. Uh. So we give it to disruptive kids in school. We are, in fact, teaching our kids that drugs can solve all of our problems. \n \n Personally, I think this stuff should be banned.\n \n It stunts growth, makes people hostile, and seriously screws them up.\n \n I guess I'm just wondering if there's really anyone out there who actually SUPPORTS this stuff.",

   "In some cases, I think that ritalin may be a viable treatment for mental disorders (ADD). I think that it is widely abused right now. I know that in order to get a prescription for ritalin from my doctor, all you have to do is fill out a single page questionair about your kid. IF hte results of the questionaire indicate the kid has ADD, or may have ADD, you gte a prescription.\n \n This seems to be kind of a loose contro when it comes to prescribing powerful mind altering substances. Try walking into your doctors office and saying \"my hand hurts and I want morphine\". Good luck on that one. Unless the doctor can find something serioulsy wrong with your hand there is a good chance the answer will be a resounding NO.\n \n I think there is a similar problem with the prescription of anti-depressents to young women.",

   "I watched my stepson go from 82 pounds to about 65 on this stuff. I watched as he lazily played with his toys, mummbled incoherently, and cried often about nothing. He's nine yrs old. I objected to him using it, but the wife insisted. He's been off now for about 6 months and is playful and happy as the others. He's also gaining weight, and from all indications, is doing just as well without it. It sure didn't help his grades while he was on it.\n \n It may be good for some, but not for all. Heck, he didn't need it at all.\n \n The physicians need to go another route, IMO.",

   "ADD and AADD are both hoaxes. Money, money, money. There is no such \"desease\" as ADD. The use of drugs  to dumb down the very intelligent but bored students who appear to be troublesome at school is just an out for the school systems to sidestep their responsibility to make school interesting and informative.\n \n A teacher can't handle a kid, she recommends ritalin. That's just one of the many things wrong with our government school systems.\n \n First we make the false assumption that all children develop mentally at the same pace. Then we put them in classes by age group, something that may not be at all related to their relative mental capabilities. Then we hold the smart ones back to keep from running off and leaving the less smart.\n \n We lower our own standards daily.",
