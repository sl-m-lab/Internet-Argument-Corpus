Logical beliefs are based upon reason. Belief in the supernatural is not.\n\n \n I believe that the difference in belief in one's perceptions of the world and belief in the supernatural is a matter of degree, not something more fundamental. You can't prove that God exists, you also can't prove that you're reading this. There is no way for you to prove, even to yourself, that your perception of the comupter screen in front of you is based on reality, and not a hallucination or an implanted memory or any of a dozen other explanations. You just take it on faith. Now, that having been said, I do believe that degree of faith needed to believe one's senses is tiny compared to the amount needed to believe in God. The first is such a tiny leap that most would call it common sense. The later is of course a huge leap.\n \n \n\n Reason is the agreed upon belief system that lets us function in the world. Are you conceding that a belief in God has no logical reason?\n\n A belief in God has no rational basis, sure. Is that what you meant?\n \n \n\n I cannot understand how you support the statement, \"there is no logical reason to believe that you need a logical reason to believe everything.\"\n \n\n I don't see how you can't. You believe a bunch of things, right? Can you logically justify all those beliefs? For example, I believe my wife loves me. I can't prove it, but I know it's true. I believe that there's life somewhere else in the universe. I have no logical justification for it, by I still think it's true. I believe the universe is pretty much as I perceive it, I believe the human condition will improve, I believe lots of things without any logical support.\n \n Just to clarify, I am most emphatically not saying that you should believe something that has logically shown to be false. I'm a firm believer in logic; if logic shows something to be true or false than I'll go with what logic says. But if you can't logically say yay or nay on a subject I don't see that one must refuse to hold an opinion. Certainly nothing in logic says that you can't; it just says that you can't use logic to justify your belief.",

   " I believe that the difference in belief in one's perceptions of the world and belief in the supernatural is a matter of degree, not something more fundamental. You can't prove that God exists, you also can't prove that you're reading this. There is no way for you to prove, even to yourself, that your perception of the comupter screen in front of you is based on reality, and not a hallucination or an implanted memory or any of a dozen other explanations. You just take it on faith. Now, that having been said, I do believe that degree of faith needed to believe one's senses is tiny compared to the amount needed to believe in God. The first is such a tiny leap that most would call it common sense. The later is of course a huge leap. \n\n \n Again, proving that something exists is entirely different than believing that something exists based on human perception and cognition.\n And believing my own eyes (while considering our human percepual imperfection) is different than believing that a God exists, and not just in degree. The former is based on a system of reason and logic and the latter is not, as you concede:\n \n \n \n\n A belief in God has no rational basis, sure. Is that what you meant? \n\n \n \n\n ... You believe a bunch of things, right? Can you logically justify all those beliefs? For example, I believe my wife loves me. I can't prove it, but I know it's true. I believe that there's life somewhere else in the universe. I have no logical justification for it, by I still think it's true. I believe the universe is pretty much as I perceive it, I believe the human condition will improve, I believe lots of things without any logical support.\n \n Just to clarify, I am most emphatically not saying that you should believe something that has logically shown to be false. I'm a firm believer in logic; if logic shows something to be true or false than I'll go with what logic says. But if you can't logically say yay or nay on a subject I don't see that one must refuse to hold an opinion. Certainly nothing in logic says that you can't; it just says that you can't use logic to justify your belief. \n\n \n I can believe that I love. My body has these emotional thoughts and sensations. They are as real as sight and smell. The name we agree to call this real, albeit intangible, thing is love. That is logical. Intangible is not the same as an invisible God. I believe my partner loves me, but that is based on his persistent and consistent loving behavior that I observe. \n \n I can believe in life elsewhere in the universe, and there is a logical reason. My reason is one of the likelihood of the probability in a huge universe.\n \n I think I can logically justify all my beliefs. Oh maybe there are a few that I would admit as illogical, but they may be something like personal preference that I can't explain. However, I would try to never illogically believe in something as important as a religion, upon which I try to mold my behavior.\n \n I salute you that you say belief in God is illogical and that you choose to believe that.

I am not trying to show that God does not exist, I am saying there is no logical reason to say that he does. As such, that is contrary to everything else I believe in the world. I use my senses and reason to believe everything. \n \n I believe it is going to rain today. Why? It looks cloudy and gray and the weather report said so. I believe the earth revolves aroung the sun.

Also, the stuff makes sense to me, given all the other information I understand about the world.\n \n If given new information, would I change my beliefs? Of course, why not?\n \n Belief in God is not like that. It is based on old books written by sources who did not document empirical findings. Many cultures create deities to explain what is at that time unexplainable. Since the Renaissance, humans have changed the way we think about everything and continue to change as new information comes to light. The only area of thought that stagnates is religion and spirituality. \n \n I am not trying to deny the absolute existence of sometimes profound spiritual experiences most definitely do occur. Humans seem to have a capacity for that experience. I am just saying we should not explain them with reason that have no basis in fact. \n \n It is in only in religion that we are able to get away with behaving illogically. Tell a devout Christian that his wife is cheating on him, or that frozen yogurt can make a man invisible, and he is likely to require as much evidence as anyone else, and to be persuaded only to the extent that you give it. Tell him that the book he keeps by his bed was written by an invisible deity who will punish him with fire for eternity if he fails to accept its every incredible claim about the universe, and he seems to require no evidence whatsoever.\n \n Thats all I'm saying.",

I quickly realised that even if this were the case, my response would essentially be: \"So what?\"\n \n All I am, unless some future genius geneticist can prove otherwise, is the sum of my experiences; therefore any spurious ideas of my brain existing in a jar are irrelevant; if I were to awake as that brain and were given a new body in whatever fantastical realm I would inhabit, my personality, my responses to stimuli, my reasoning, would still be based on my fictional experiences within the artificial world created by my cerebral captors. \n Likewise if I were to awake, finding that my life so far was a dream within a coma, and I was older or younger than I am now, my dreamed experiences would still form the sum of my personality, regardless of the 'truth' of the acual existing reality.

   "It looks like we are simple going to disagree on this: illogical = not supported by logic.\n\n Seems to me that any statement can have three logical values. True, false, or indeterminate. There are some statements that we simply don't have the ability to decide if they are true or false, at least at present. Logically one should believe true statements. Believing false statements is illogical. But if a statement is logically indeterminate, than logic is done with it, it's done all that it can do. At that point you must use some other tool to come to a decision if you think the statement is true or not. Whichever decision you come to won't contratict logic.\n \n Hm. That's crystalized my thinking. When trying to decide if something is true, logic is your first and best tool for deciding. But it's not the only tool. If logic doesn't give you an answer than use another tool. That tool may not be appropriate for convincing other people, and you should recognize that. Also, more evidence may surface, and then logic could become the right tool, but that doesn't mean it's wrong to use the other tool in the meantime.\n \n Sorry to harp on this, but it is central to my line of thinking. If we agree to disagree than we'll be done, and I'm enjoying this discussion. :)\n \n \n\n With the brick, I would believe it is possible for a brick to be in the shoebox - a logical belief.

I feel beliefs should be based on evidence, empirical or logical.\n\n I think that beliefs shouldn't contradict evidence. If you're going to base actions, or anything meaningful, on your beliefs, then it's a good idea to have your beliefs based on evidence. But if believing something has no real consequences than I don't see that the criteria need to be so strict.\n \n Question: What are you thinking when you say \"belief\"? I suspect that you might be using a stronger form of the word than I am. To my mind believing that something is true isn't the same as asserting that it's true. If something is logically true than it's definately, certainly true. If I simply believe that something is true than I fully acknowledge that I could be wrong. I'm saying that there's nothing wrong with believing something without evidence; but if evidence comes along that contradicts your belief than you should adjust your belief accordingly. One could say that beliefs based on evidence are \"strong\" beliefs, while ones without the backing of evidence are \"weak\" beliefs. Beliefs that contradict evidence are just silly.",

   ".\n What I personally believe is irrevelent, and does not consern anyone. What I do is search the Scriptures, and in so doing I have found according to Scripture that there is intelligent life out there in the universe.\n \n \"God created the heavens first, (this includes the entire universe), then the Earth (Gen. 1:1). He did this some time ago in the dateless past, in the beginning (Gen. 1:1; and , Job 38:4-7). Not six thousand years ago as fundamental Christianity teaches. check out this site, very interesting; http://www.christiangeology.com\n \n In Isa. 45:18 it states, \"For thus saith the Lord that created the Heavens; God Himself that formed the Earth and made it; he hath established it, He created it not in vain, He formed it to be inhabited:\" \n \n In Revelation 12:12 it states; \"Therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye THAT DWELL IN THEM.\" . . . . Woe to the inhabiters or the earth and of the sea! etc.\n \n It does specificly say heavens, and ye that dewll in them;\n\n \n Em, can you answer me this question: where is the location of Heavens?",

   "No one is saying that faith constitutes a reasonable argument. Faith is in fact exactly the opposite. It's belief despite the lack of a reason to believe. I will say, however, that there is no logical reason to believe that you need a logical reason to believe everything. Is that not so? After all, you can not logically prove the existence of anything except your own self, and that only to yourself. None the less, I'm guessing that you believe that the world is pretty much as you perceive it, despite the lack of any logical reason to do so. You take it on faith. An utterly different level of faith than the kind needed to believe in God, granted, but faith none the less.\n\n lmao! this was so well stated it easily went over most people's head. anyway, nicely done",

   "I don't I see a difference between \"not supported by logic\" and illogical. I am not trying to show that God does not exist, I am saying there is no logical reason to say that he does. As such, that is contrary to everything else I believe in the world. I use my senses and reason to believe everything.\n\n actually there is a difference between what is illogical and what is not supported by logic. kronus gave some good examples, like the probability of life on other planets. there is no real logical basis for believing that lif exists on other planets, but at the same time the belief isnt illogical. thats why not eerything we believe necessarily has to have a logical basis just for us to believe it. there are lots of things we are required to believe to function the way we want to, and logic cannot even be applied in the decision making process. in these cases faith is the only thing to go on. call it gut, instinct, or whatever, its just irreconcilable by logic, yet necessary that we have a belief about it. yet those faith-based beliefs are not necessarily illogical",
