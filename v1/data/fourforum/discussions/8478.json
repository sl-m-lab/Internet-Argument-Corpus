   "The G8 Summit in St. Petersburg gives no rest to GUAM, especially to some of its members. \n July 6, 2006 the explosion of taxi in Tiraspol happened, 7 dead and over 35 wounded as a result of it. July 9, 2006 as a result of bomb explosion was killed the secretary of South Ossetia Security Council Oleg Alborov. I'm sure that those acts of terrorism were organized by Moldavian and Georgian Special Forces. \n It's well-known that Moldavia and Georgia have some territorial claims to TransDniestrea and South Ossetia. Well, I think that those countries officials need to draw international community attention to those problems even by using so hard methods of terrorism. I think it were provocations only for situation in districts worsening on the threshold of G8 Summit.\n Saakashvili and Voronin are aware that they are losing control over situation. Look, some time ago in Georgia only Abkhazians and Ossetins fought and organized protest actions against their dependence on Tbilisi. But now ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanians added to them in fight for independency. Saakashvili is loosing control over the country that's why he needs real reason to draw troops into South Ossetia (for example secretary of South Ossetia Security Council Alborov's murder). \n At the same time Voronin knows about Romania's wish to annex part of Moldavia and he gave his 'yes' to it in exchange for money and promises to give him political asylum. Moldavian president also tries to destabilize to get a pretext. So he ordered his special services to destabilize the situation by a bomb blast in TransDnestria so that NATO could draw troops there and organize Moldavia's separation as Yugoslavia. And of course after it most part of Moldavia (with TransDniestrean) will be joining to Romania. \n Well, IMO the attempts of Moldavia and Georgia rulers raise some doubts about their right to decide about the fate of the break-away states within their borders - TransDnestria, South Ossetia and Abkhasia.",
