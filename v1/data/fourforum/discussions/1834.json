   "by Walter Cronkite \n \n The forthcoming presidential election will be decided on several issues of profound importance to the nation's future. It is unfortunate that the debates about them will be confounded by a religious issue that does not belong on the political agenda. The issue is same-sex marriage. \n \n A majority of our people identify themselves as Christian, and many of the faithful believe that they have a mission to pass on the word of God to those who do not believe with the same fervor as themselves. Their faith is admirable: Indeed, this might be a better world if we all obeyed our religious lessons with similar devotion. \n \n But that, of course, is not the case. And the zealots who follow the leadership of the so-called religious right are threatening us with religious war, fought on the battleground of the presidential election. \n \n The zealots are determined to make a political issue of their conviction that same-sex marriages are so immoral as to threaten the well-being of the nation, if not civilization itself. The more fanatical among them even claim that same-sex marriages would encourage homosexuality to the degree that the nation's birthrate would be endangered. They also fear that children adopted by same-sex couples will choose to follow the lifestyle of their adoptive parents and thus perpetuate, even exacerbate, what they see as the \"problem\" of homosexuality. \n \n Whatever the unlikelihood of its more drastic fears coming to pass - or of it ever successfully legislating moral behavior - the conservative Christian right is entitled to its beliefs and to its determined pursuit to criminalize same-sex marriage. Our constitutional guarantees freedom of speech, press and religion, after all. \n \n There are many of us Christians who recall our Sunday-school teachers and later our ministers dwelling upon the sympathy and respect - indeed, the tolerance - for others that, they taught, was basic to our Christian religion. As the prophet Isaiah summed up this need for tolerance: \"Come, let us reason together.\" \n \n We who believe this are compelled to ask: Where is the tolerance, where is the Christian spirit in the effort to criminalize the personal choices of our fellow citizens, personal choices that do not physically threaten others? Where is the Christian tolerance in the conceit of those Christian leaders who dare suggest that they alone can be trusted to properly interpret the lessons of their Bible, and who would impose that belief on this nation's highly diverse peoples by threatening to throw them in jail if they don't agree with the Christian right's version of God's wishes? \n \n Besides wishing to criminalize individual behavior, the more radical members of the Christian right would like their proposed federal law to dictate what individual churches could do in regard to recognizing or performing same-sex marriages. This is another abomination. Shouldn't that decision be made by the individual church or denomination? What possible excuse is there for government intervention in this decision except an unreasonable, unchristian intolerance for freedom of worship? \n \n Where is the Christian tolerance in those right-wing Christian leaders who would impose their religious beliefs on the entire diverse population of the United States, even to the extent of a Constitutional amendment curtailing our rights of religious freedom? \n \n As the conservative Christian leadership presses this matter, which they depict as a moral issue, they threaten a religious war that will split our nation at a time when unity would be helpful in attacking far more critical problems - our foreign policy, the economy, education, medical care and the environment, to name a few. \n \n In the difficult days ahead, the tolerant among us - Republican, Democratic or Independent, Christian, Muslim, Jewish or nonbeliever - are going to have to try to preach another morality, and that is the morality of tolerance. \n \n http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/editorial/8017170.htm",

   "of course this article is loaded with bias, but I wont get into that\n \n first of all, opposition to homosexual marriage is not just a religious matter. it is also a legal matter and some even consider it a constitutional matter. of course the government reserves the right to revise the legal definition of \"marriage\" in its jurisdiction\n \n second, the author holds a rather stereotypical and possibly warped idea of the church. the church will continue to oppose homosexual marriage even in the event that it is legal. furthermore, the expectation that the church be absolutely tolerant of everything everybody does is a false expectation. nowhere has the church declared to tolerate all behavior or all ideas. they accept all people, but check your unchurchly behavior at the door, so to speak.\n \n third, it is not any more \"zealous\" for a religious leader to speak against homosexuality than it is for an atheist to speak against religion. both are based solely on unfounded abstract beliefs\n \n finally, your author calls for \"morality of tolerance\". the word tolerance is being used so flagrantly nowadays, people use it as a trump card when then expect they should be given the liberty to do whatever they like and get away with it. thats just not realistic. like I said in another thread, you cannot expect an institution with goals, and hence rules, to show \"absolute tolerance\". ironically enough, the position the religios right takes is no more than a personal belief. how is it wrong for them to hold their personal beliefs, while you reject their personal beliefs in the same breath you ask for tolerance of your beliefs from them?",

   "Wow, I must applaud your strength of will, unkerpaulie, if you are able to choose who you are attracted to. Does this mean that it doesn't matter what a woman looks like, you simply make a choice to be attracted and then it is so?\n \n Speaking for myself, and probably most other people, attraction is not a choice. If a woman is attractive to me, it doesn't mean I choose to be attracted. Rather, subconcious, biological forces cause me to be attracted. Thats why advertisements use sex as a tool to sell, because that attraction acts whether or not you choose to be attracted. I think this applies to any attraction, hetero- or homosexual. It is not a choice.\n \n Many churches have already stated their willingness to perform same-sex marriages. And I think Jesus were around now, he'd have more important things than same-sex marriage on his mind.",

   "Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from you and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other specific laws and how to follow them:\n \n 1. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?\n \n 2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?\n \n 3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15:19- 24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.\n \n 4. Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?\n \n 5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?\n \n 6. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an\n abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality.I don't agree. Can you settle this?\n \n 7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?\n \n 8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?\n \n 9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?\n \n 10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)?\n \n I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.",

Bush and Kerry have both come out against gay marriage, and both said they would support/allow civil unions. Gay marriage is likely to be ignored in the upcoming election.\n \n Looking at Bush and Kerry, and their views on the issues, it is nearly impossible to see any real ideological differences between them. They are pretty much the same on Iraq, they are the same on economy (though both their alleged \"economic plans\" read like fiction), they are the same on gun control, they are the same on health care. The big difference may be that kerry might not have given us the tax cuts last time around, but that doesn;t really matter now because that is over and done with. I am fairly certain they photocopied their foreign policy statements from the same book.\n \n I would be interested in seeing a list of these issues that are profound to this nations future.

   "Wow, I was just googling around while reading this thread and came across this page about what the Bible says on homosexuality.\n http://www.bible.com/answers/ahomosex.html\n \nIn the Old Testament the penalty for this sin was severe. Leviticus 20:13: \"If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.\" Today the penalty of death comes in the form of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. It also brings death to the soul and spirit of man because the life of God is pushed out by indulging in something that is an abomination to God. God wants to deliver all who are trapped in this unholy practice and He will if anyone calls out to Him with a sincere heart.\n\n Aparently they didn't have STDs back then. :)\n \n It goes on:\n \n\n Sex is God's idea and its purpose is not only for procreation, but also for recreation and the development of a deep relationship between man and woman. Nothing is wrong or dirty about sex when it is engaged in the bonds of marriage as the Lord commanded in the Bible. However, when perversions are committed inside the marriage relationship, this can be sinful also. God made man and woman and brought them together \"face to face.\" Oral sex is of homosexual origin that replaces the normal \"face to face\" relationship God intended in a marriage. The Bible describes the sex act in Song of Solomon Chapter 4. In this chapter it speaks of this \"face to face\" relationship by describing looking into his lover's eyes and kissing his lover's lips and fondling his lover's breasts. Oral sex is not normal or natural as it is an unclean act.\n\n No doggie-style for you!\n Kissing is ok, but oral sex is \"unclean.\"\n \n Actually Solomon 4 says nothing of the sort.\n \n Song of Solomon 4\n 1 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.\n 2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.\n 3 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.\n 4 Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.\n 5 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.\n 6 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.\n 7 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.\n 8 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.\n 9 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.\n 10 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!\n 11 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.\n 12 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.\n 13 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,\n 14 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:\n 15 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.\n 16 Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.\n \n\n \n Let's read some more of Song of Solomon\n \n This one was just funny:\n \n1:9-I liken you, my darling, to a mare\n harnessed to one of the chariots of Pharaoh. \n\n \n \n2:3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, \n so is my beloved among the sons. \n I sat down under his shadow with great delight, \n and his fruit was sweet to my taste. \n\n What fruit is that? His banana? O wait, it's his \"apple.\"\n \n \n\n 4:10 How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride!\n How much more pleasing is your love than wine,\n and the fragrance of your perfume than any spice! \n\n Surely this doesn't mean incest.\n \n \n 5:4 My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.\n\n GROSS!emoticon_hb\n \n \n 8:1 O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.\n\n Sounds like incest and homosexuality to me!",
