Personally, I would have come up with an essay about all religions, as opposed to a single one. Even so, I found his essay lacking more persuasive reasons he could have made.",

I read it at some point during a time when I was inquisitive...a time of some questioning of my Christian beliefs but mostly just of seeing what was out there and how it stacked up against my beliefs. I have the book with some of his other writings around here. I remember writing some notes in it but I don't have it handy at the moment. If I find it and any of my notes seem worthwhile then I will post again.",
