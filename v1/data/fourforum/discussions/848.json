   "I've always wondered.. What's the difference between Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Church of Christ? Or any other Protestant denominations for that matter (aside from Mormons and Episcopalians).\n \n Thanks.\n\n \n I'll start by saying that all orthodox, Christian denominations believe the same, essential principles, those being (borrowed from http://www.equip.org/essentials/index.html):\n \n \nFirst, we believe in the authority of Scripture, which is another way of saying that the Bible is God's inspired, infallible, and inerrant Word. It's the ultimate source for knowledge about God, as well as the definitive guide for our daily lives.\n \n Next we affirm the existence of a triune God or one God in three distinct persons - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This God is self-existent, eternal, unchanging, omnipotent, omnipresent, holy, righteous, and loving. God created the universe from nothing and He rules over His creation sovereignly including both human and angelic beings.\n \n We also hold that man is a physical and spiritual being who is created in God's image. But because of his sin or transgression, man has lost his fellowship with God. The extent of sin is so great that its effects continue to this very day in the form of cruelty, suffering, and death.\n \n By God's grace, Jesus Christ - Who is fully God and fully man - was sent to save us from our bondage to sin. We believe that Christ was born of a virgin, died for our sins, physically rose from the dead, and will one day return to judge the world and deliver His people. Faith in Christ is the only means by which mankind can escape eternal damnation and judgment.\n \n Finally, we recognize the church as God's ordained institution headed by Christ. The church is composed of all believers, and is organized for worship, for fellowship, for the administration of the sacraments, for spiritual growth and support, and for evangelizing the world.\n\n \n If a denomination accepts a creed, statement, etc. officially that denies any of the above, then that denomination is guilty of heresy (of course, that is not to say that all members of the said denomination are heretical - all may not accept the creed). If the denomination persists in the heretical belief, it will no longer be considered a denomination, therefore not Christian.\n \n If an organization (such as Mormons or Jehovah's Witnesses) claim to be Christian, yet do not believe in the above essentials, then they are NOT truly Christian.\n \n All that being said, anything else in the Bible that can be interpreted differently, but is not essential to Christian faith, can be debated. Though unfortunate, many people take these doctrines and make too much of them, thus dividing the church (often these non-essentials become essential to a person or persons - such as full-immersion versus sprinkling baptism - and an even larger divide is caused that actually causes people to believe there is heresy where there is none). Though doctrine is important, I take to heart the following statement, also from http://www.equip.org:\n \n \nIn essentials unity, in nonessentials liberty, and in all things charity.\n\n \n I know this doesn't answer specifically what a Baptist believes versus a Methodist. I know much of what Baptists believe (being a Baptist for most of my life). Since I am now non-denominational, I have parted from some of those and accepted others. If I have time, I can share some of that later. Maybe some Methodists, etc. will post some of their beliefs.",

The Church often only defines dogma when it is challenged. This does not mean that the concept/belief did not exist prior to the formal definition. This is the case with the Trinity.\n \n The word Trinity in reference to the Christian God was first used in 180 AD. Theophilus, the bishop of Antioch coined it in the Epistle to Autolycus. Tertullian also used the term well before 325. He used it in On Modesty  (22) a few decades after Theophilus. There is also foreshadowing of the Trinity in Judaism. In Genesis God uses the term we in the creation story.\n \n Arius was the heretic because he DID NOT believe in the Trinity. He was going against the accepted view of Christianity.",

   "Maximus,\n \n Thank you for your informative reply.\n \n Pikeman,\n \n Just because the term \"Trinity\" is not used does not mean the belief was not there. I have borrowed again from equip.org because they can say this much better than I can:\n \n \n\n Jesus often spoke of God as His Father, and the apostles frequently spoke of \"God the Father.\" But the New Testament also insists that Jesus is God. For example, Thomas acknowledged Jesus as, \"My Lord and my God\" (John 20:28), and both Peter and Paul spoke of Jesus as \"our God and Savior\" (2 Pet. 1:1; Tit. 2:13). Yet the New Testament also makes the distinction between the Father and the Son as two very different persons. In fact they tell us that they love one another, speak to each other, and seek to glorify each other (e.g., John 17: 1-26). \n \n The Old Testament refers often to the Holy Spirit as God at work in the world, without distinction from the Father. But Jesus in John 14 to 16 explained that this Holy Spirit would be sent by the Father at Christ's request. The Holy Spirit would teach and guide the disciples, not speaking on His own initiative, but speaking on Christ's behalf and glorifying Christ. Thus, the Holy Spirit is revealed by Christ to be a third person distinct from the Father and distinct from the Son. \n \n \n\n \n What I am trying to point out here is that we can start right in the Bible and see that the Trinity was a belief. For that matter, Christians were not even called Christians until well after Christ had died and was resurrected (Acts 11:26). Yet they still believed in Jesus as their Christ.",

I would use him to prove the existence of the idea of the Trinity at an earlier time than 325 though. \n \n Constantine did not decide Church doctrine. He called the council of bishops and the council solidified and articulated the doctrine that was already present. This is how things were done in the Church from the beginning. The first church council occurred in Acts.\n \n There were many messiah hopefuls but there was only one that fulfilled all of the prophecies of the Old Testament--the Jesus Christ of the Christian bible.",
