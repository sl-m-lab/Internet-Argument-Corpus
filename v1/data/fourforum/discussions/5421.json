Be warned though, science and apologetics aren't exactly their weak suit. I've seen many people that make claims like you have been in this forum, get their seemingly solid arguments ripped to shreds. And believe me they are much much better at it than me.\n\n \n Er... Are you being serious?\n \n http://answersingenesis.org/Home/Area/AnswersBook/flood12.asp\n \n \nCould the water have covered Mount Everest?\n \n Mt Everest is almost 9 km (5.5 miles) high. How, then, could the Flood have covered 'all the high hills under the whole heaven'? \n \n The Bible refers only to 'high hills,' and the mountains today were formed only towards the end of, and after, the Flood by collision of the tectonic plates and the associated upthrusting. In support of this, the layers that form the uppermost parts of Mt Everest are themselves composed of fossil-bearing, water-deposited layers.\n \n This uplift of the new continental land-masses from under the Flood waters would have meant that, as the mountains rose and the valleys sank, the waters would have rapidly drained off the newly emerging land surfaces. The collapse of natural dams holding back the floodwaters on the land would also have caused catastrophic flooding. Such rapid movement of large volumes of water would have caused extensive erosion and shaped the basic features of today's Earth surface. \n The Olgas\n Kata Tjuta in central Australia is composed of material which must have been deposited quickly by water.\n \n Thus it is not hard to envisage the rapid carving of the landscape features that we see on the earth today, including places such as the Grand Canyon of the USA. The present shape of Uluru (Ayers Rock), a sandstone monolith in central Australia, is the result of erosion, following tilting and uplift, of previously horizontal beds of water-laid sand. The feldspar-rich sand that makes up Uluru must have been deposited very quickly and recently. Long-distance transport of the sand would have caused the grains to be rounded and sorted, whereas they are jagged and unsorted. If they had sat accumulating slowly in a lake bed drying in the sun over eons of time, which is the story told in the geological display at the park center, the feldspar would have weathered into clay. Likewise, if Uluru had sat in the once-humid area of central Australia for millions of years, it would have weathered to clay.21 Similarly, the nearby Kata Tjuta (The Olgas) are composed of an unsorted mixture of large boulders, sand and mud, indicating that the material must have been transported and deposited very rapidly.\n \n Receding floodwaters eroded the land, creating river valleys. This explains why rivers are often so much smaller than the valleys they flow in today-they did not carve the valleys. The water flow that carved out the river valleys must have been far greater than the volume of water we see flowing in the rivers today. This is consistent with voluminous Flood waters draining off the emerging land surfaces at the close of Noah's Flood, and flowing into the rapidly sinking, newly prepared, deep ocean basins.\n \n Our understanding of how the Flood could have occurred is continually developing. Ideas come and go, but the fact of the Flood remains. Genesis clearly testifies to it, Jesus and the Apostles confirmed it, and there is abundant global geological evidence for a global watery cataclysm.\n\n \n I thought that \"science and apologetics aren't exactly their weak suit.\"?\n \n -Wez",

   "The chances are, most of us here are familiar with answersingenesis.org and other creationist-lie websites. Science and apologetics are their weak suits: misrepresentation and dishonesty are their strong suits. They rely on their target audience being ignorant of science and thus easily fooled by their falsehoods, half-truths and misrepresentation of science. If there was any validity to their \"refuting\" of solid evidence against a literal interpretation of Genesis, then their ideas would be out their in the science mainstream of science journals, rather than relegated to some backwater of the web.\n \n Why should we go to their site though and allow them to selectively pick which emails they wish to repsond to on their terms? Let them come here or to another public forum and put themselves on the line in an open and live debate. I have layed down a challenge to all creationists to come here and formally debate any aspect of evolution they want with me. If you think these people at answersingenesis.org are so hot on the topic, invite them over. They won't come though, for their arguments do not stand up to real debate by people who understand the topic. Of course I would be overjoyed if you proved me wrong by getting one to show their face here. Good luck.\n\n Well Clive, I will formally invite them here........ I don't know if any of them will take my invitation seriously, but we will see.",

   "If you truly believe that Genesis has been proven wrong, I recommend you check out this website. http://answersingenesis.org This is the leading creationist website online. In fact Answers in Genesis is the leading creationist organization in the world. I think if you'll go to their Q&A Topics section, you'll find that all of the supposed scientific evidence that contradicts Genesis, has been pretty solidly refuted. In fact you can even E-mail them and debate them. They often respond publicly to these types of E-mails by all kinds of people. Be warned though, science and apologetics aren't exactly their weak suit. I've seen many people that make claims like you have been in this forum, get their seemingly solid arguments ripped to shreds. And believe me they are much much better at it than me.\n\n \n They also are liars, cons, and not scientific at all. I have had some discustions with a few of those on another forum, and frankly, they know nothing about science. They might be the 'leading creationsit organization' in the world (accordgin to them), but they STILL have a terrible misunderstanding of science.

So on the Ark, there was a canine that had all the information in its DNA on how to be a dog, wolf, coyote, fox etc and when the Ark parked up on Mt Arafat, that canine devolved into all the dog kind we see today.

   "Can you present even one shred of evidence that evolution actually did occur?\nSure. You could find library shelves full of books and scientific journals full of reports of the evidence if you reallly wanted to find it. I suspect that you have an ax to grind. You know what you want the answer to be so you are gullible to accept the mythology of bronze age nomadic herdsmen as fact and reject science - in fact, not even make an effort to find the easily available information.\n \n In your sig, you use a quote from a 1959 newspaper article in the Fresno Bee. That's pretty much on par with most \"evidence\" from \"creation science.\" From what I can find, TN Tahmisian was a physiologist employed by the (then) Atomic Energy Commission (now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration since 1974). I found some articles to work he had done with electon microscopes, but nothing on evolutionary biology. He doesn't seem to have been an \"evolutionist\" as you claim. Certainly his work and publications were not of an evolutionary nature and the quote you give is cited only on creationist sites. I wonder what the context of the article might show. I wonder if Dr Tahmisian wasn't actually a creationist. But creationists have to gleen support for their bizarre religious beliefs where they can. 1959 doesn't seem to be too old for creationism whereas you would be hard pressed to find scientific cites from the 1980s.\n \n At any rate, when he spoke there wasn't any such thing as \"creation science.\" The Seventh Day Adventist, George McCready Price and barely invente flood geology which was adopted in the early 1960s by Henry Morris and called \"creation science.\" The Supreme Court declared that \"creation science\" is not science but a religiously motivated effort to make a particular religious view sound scientific. That's why creationism can't be taught in public schools.\n \n So I'll give you examples of evolution - not shreds of evidence, but observations of actual evolutionary events. I guess you are either new to these boards or haven't been paying attention. I've mentioned them before, but I'll mention them again just for you.\n \n Apples are not native to North America but were introduced from Europe. In the first half of the 19th century, John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) traveled from Massachusetts to the Ohio valley carrying bags of apple seed. He traveled up and down the valley planting apples. Since the apples were an introduced plant, there were no natural pests. However, in the 1850s worms began to appear in apples. Investigation found that they were the larvae of small flies that appeared identical to hawthorn maggot flies. But the life cycle of these flies was closely linked to the time that the host plant set fruit. They matured and were sexually active only during those few days each year, and hawthorn and apples set fruit at times separated by several weeks. Studies have shown that hawthorn maggot flies and apple maggot flies do not interbreed, in fact cannot since they are sexually active at times separated by weeks. This is a speciation event. It has happened at least twice more with similar maggot flies that now infest pears and cherrys, two other introduced plants. We might note that maggot flies do not infest other plants like the citrus plants. They are limited strictly to members of the rose family of plants. Not unexpected from an evolutionary standpoint.\n \n The herring gull shares its range with the lesser black-backed gull, the herring gull ranging to the west from northern Europe, and the lesser black-backed gull to the east. The herring gull population extends across the Atlanatic to Iceland, southern Greenland and North America. The American herring gull can be found across the northern part of the continent to Alaska, where it meets the Vega herring gull in Siberia, which meets Birula's gull, which meets Heuglin's gull, which meets the Siberian lesser black-backed gull, which meets the lesser black-backed gull. At all points, the various populations are capable of interbreeding (and do interbreed) and produce fertile off spring. Except the herring gull and the lesser black-backed gull do not interbreed. Even though they are at the extremes of a single population that encircles the globe, they have been classified as separate species. An event that wiped out herring gulls in North America would be a speciation event.\n \n The same has been observed in a population of salamanders that encircles California's central valley, and in a species of warbler that encircles the Tibeten plateau.\n \n Fruit flies used in laboratory genetics studies are all derived from a single strain from California. It has been discovered that strains that have been maintained in isolation from others of identical ancestry can no longer interbreed. Nor can the laboratory strains interbreed with the original parent population. More speciation events that occurred when populations were isolated.\n \n Polar bears and brown bears can interbreed and do produce fertile offspring. The two species can be distinguished by genetic analysis, except for the brown bears of the ABC islands of Alaska. They cannot be distinguished genetically from polar bears although they appear no different from any other brown bear.\n \n Need more? Can you actually discuss any of the above or will you just move the goal posts and define evolution out of existance?",
