   "I am only referring these posts to you Lappster because you seem to be the only creationist with enough guts to post consistently and come back for more, even when people disgaree with you in ways that are sometimes less than polite. I admire that about you. But I found a site which listed many popular arguments posed by creationists against evolution, and thought some very interesting points were made.\n \n My link will appear at the bottom of this post.\n \n Evolutionists themselves admit they have no proof.\n \n That is because science doesn't \"prove\": it shows possibilities and disproves things and makes predictions. Science doesn't deal in proof. It deals in evidence. Evolution has LOTS of evidence. \n \n \n Twenty objections admitted: evolutionists themselves have admitted to flaws in their argument.\n \n Isn't it nice to have a system that you can criticize and test? The only system which has no flaws is one in which those flaws are either defined away or ignored. We call this dogma. The presence of these flaws reveils the presence of active investigation into the limits. We call this \"science\". \n \n \n Scientists condemn evolution: some scientists don't agree etc. ....\n \n Then the same argument disproves Creationism, too, since many (most?) theologians don't agree with it. \n \n What else has 100% concurrence? Gravity is not 100% concurred with, either. \n \n \n Evolution isn't a science because you can't observe things that happened millions of years ago.\n \n Buy you can observe the RESULTS of things that happened millions of years ago. And then, by using basic scientific knowledge, extrapolate back. And by observing trends within the period you can derive general rules which may then be used for predictions into the future. Just the historical observation is not evolution. \n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-meritt.html\n \n MQ",

   "That's an interesting question, and although I don't think the answer in any way threatens evolution or supports creationism, I myself would be interested in the comments of the forum about what predictions biology can make for general paths that evolution might make in the future, especially in light of man's intereference on a global basis. I am also interested in some commentary on a statement first introduced to me by my 9th grade biology teacher: if you don't use it, you lose it. Where in nature has this trend been observed? What kind of predictions can science make about mankind's future development, given the fact that we seem to be meddling with our own natural selection? (people with genetically-based disease and mutations are now often absorbed into society, often producing offspring which in some cases can be passed down) The parameters of \"survival of the fittest\" have shifted. In past ages, the \"fittest\" placed more importance on strength, agility and reflexes (though intelligence has always been the most important factor I presume). Now the fittest can sometimes be the scrawny, anemic egghead who burried his head in books throughout highschool instead of catching touchdown passes. And then again, perhaps the distribution of DNA balances out in the end. The egghead may not distribute his DNA quite as early there in the backseat of his father's Lincoln with the captain of the cheerleader squad begging for more, but when he inevitably makes his first million at age 30ish, he has become infinately more attractive to that cheerleader who has since divorced her beer-drinking ex-jock Al Bundy lookalike husband.\n \n Impossible to say. Except maybe with computer simulation. I would be interested however in speculations made about the future of the evolution of various species on Earth, comparitively perhaps, one using a formula to account for the interference of man and one without. \n \n Lappster, I noticed that you commented on just one small point of several issues posted.

   "lappster: Just curious. Does evolution deal in the prediction of it's next step (s)?\n \n To some extent, yes. In fact, you have probably read about some of those predictions without knowing that you were reading about evolutionary biology. Do you remember when biologists predicted the extinction of the bald eagle if nothing was done. That was evolutionary biology - specifically population genetics. Another bird was the whooping crane. At one time, in spite of all efforts, protection, and breeding programs the numbers of whooping cranes continued to drop. It was thought, for a time, that the numbers had fallen below the minimum viable population (MVP). But the biologists were wrong - just barely. The numbers began to rise again when it had been reduced to a few hundred individuals. \n \n The observed reality of principle of the MVP is one thing that makes the 2 of every \"kind\" scenario seem so ridiculous. A population of 2 isn't viable. For most species the MVP is in the thousands to tens of thousands. For some it may be a few hundred, but a population of 2 cannot survive.\n \n But there are other examples of predictions made by evolutionary biologists. Do you get flu shots every year? Why? Why doesn't last year's shot work for this year? The answer is that the flu virus mutates and evolves so rapidly that it is probably immune to the vaccine from the previous year. So how is enough vaccine produced every year? The answer is that biologists look for changes in flue strains and predict which one will be the most virulent some 6 to 10 months later. They then produce the vaccine for that strain. Two years ago they missed. There was so little vaccine available tht it was limited to the very young, very old, or very sick. Many people died that year.\n \n For others read The Beak of the Finch: A Story of Evolution in Our Time by Jonathan Weiner. Rosemary and Peter Grant studied the finches of Dauphine Major in the Galapagos for over 20 years. Even after several years of work they were stunned at how quickly observable evolution happened under certain environmental conditions.\n \n Or there was the case of a biologist who observed populations of related guppies. He hypothesized the reason for the differences between them. He then introduced members of one of the populations to another stream and found that the characteristics of that population changed exactly as he predicted. If you saw the PBS 7 part series, \"Evolution\", then you saw this story. You can play with a simulation HERE. You can also read about it in the companion book, Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea by Carl Zimmer. Keep in mind that none of it is an argument against creation or religion. But it does tell what biologists think evolution is. What creationists want to pretend that it is is irrelevant.\n \n Creationists usually object to the above with the complaint the there is no improvement in the organism or that a eagles are still eagles and whooping cranes are still whooping cranes, and guppies are still guppies. This is, of course a gross misrepresentation of what evolution is and what the theories say. And the question about prediction is probably really asking biologists predict when a dog will give birth to a cat or a horse will grow wings?\n \n But in reality, specific, very narrow predictions in well studied situations are the only ones likely to be met with any success. To ask what lions will look like in a million years, or any organism for that matter, is pure speculation. It will depend on what happens to the environment, how quickly it happens, and how much genetic diversity exists in the genome of the organism. Cheetahs, for example, are very brittle. The likelihood that they would survive a significant climate change is remote. They have so little genetic variability that a change that is bad for one is bad for all.\n \n But your next question will be to ask why evolutionists claim that like any science, evolutionary theory is predictive. That is in reference to the scientific method. It is not a prediction necessarily of events that will happen in the future, but of an observation that should be true to support the hypothesis. For example, if the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs, then there should exist fossils that show a mixture of dinosaur and bird characteristics. And there is. There are feathered dinosaurs, toothed birds with claws on their wings and long boney tails. There are fossil birds that have gastralia (abdominal ribs - only in reptiles and dinosaurs). And there are birds without or with very small carinas (keeled sternum).\n \n I'll give you another. Human chromosome 2 matches the banding pattern of chimpanzee chromosomes 2p and 2q, exactly. If humans and chimps share a common ancestor, the either the ancestral single chromosome broke or two chromosomes fused. If the later is the case, then there MUST be an area of telomeric sequences (they are found at the ends of chromosomes) that consists of two head to head sequences at the point of the proposed fusion. This was predicted and confirmed. A second prediction was that there should be an area that is an inactive centromere on human chromosome 2 (since there is only one centromere on the chromosome) and it should correspond EXACTLY to the position of the centromere on chimp chromosome 2q. That prediction was also verified.\n \n MarkQuinn: I am also interested in some commentary on a statement first introduced to me by my 9th grade biology teacher: if you don't use it, you lose it. Where in nature has this trend been observed?\n \n There are lots of examples of cave dwelling organisms that have lost their eyes. Sometimes there is something left and sometimes most traces have disappeared. If something isn't and advantage then there is no positive selection for that trait. It may be neutral, being neither advantageous nor disadvantageous in which case the trait may drift. On the othere hand, if a trait is a disadvantage, it will eventually disappear. In the case above, not only do eyes in a dark world offer no advantage, they are a disadvantage. Considerable resources are invested in eyes and they are prone to injury and infection. Another example is an apendix. It offers little advantage and is prone to infection. Cats don't have them.\n \n MarkQuinn: What kind of predictions can science make about mankind's future development, given the fact that we seem to be meddling with our own natural selection? (people with genetically-based disease and mutations are now often absorbed into society, often producing offspring which in some cases can be passed down)\n \n Don't know and I'm not all that concerned with it. Certainly we have affected our evolution in some way because of our ability to control our environment and to correct genetics.\n \n MarkQuinn: The parameters of \"survival of the fittest\" have shifted. In past ages, the \"fittest\" placed more importance on strength, agility and reflexes (though intelligence has always been the most important factor I presume). Now the fittest can sometimes be the scrawny, anemic egghead who burried his head in books throughout highschool instead of catching touchdown passes.\n \n The \"fittest\" may not mean what you think it to mean. That phrase was coined by Herbert Spencer who established what has come to be called \"social Darwinism.\" It predated Darwin and was already a familiar term when Darwin published his theory. Darwin was quite upset that it was applied to his theory of natural selection. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. It is in response to the whole environment. For example, more football quarterbacks die on the athletic field than eggheads do in the library. Even in early societies the scrawney individual who was unskilled at hunting could be highly respected. Take for example a fletcher who could only see to the end of his arm but made beautiful and durable arrows. And, of course, in west Africa those individuals who possessed one copy of a lethal gene were better fit than those who had none or two.\n \n MarkQuinn: And then again, perhaps the distribution of DNA balances out in the end. The egghead may not distribute his DNA quite as early there in the backseat of his father's Lincoln with the captain of the cheerleader squad begging for more, but when he inevitably makes his first million at age 30ish, he has become infinately more attractive to that cheerleader who has since divorced her beer-drinking ex-jock Al Bundy lookalike husband.\n \n Bill Gates?\n \n MarkQuinn: Impossible to say. Except maybe with computer simulation. I would be interested however in speculations made about the future of the evolution of various species on Earth, comparitively perhaps, one using a formula to account for the interference of man and one without.\n \n There is going to be (or was and I missed it) on the Discovery channel I think, a program about the future of evolution. I'm going to speculate that it will be highly speculative, based on little evidence and a lot of imagination.\n \n By the way, all of the above was just random thoughts based on a lot of years of reading about biology and evolution. Except for the PBS link. It is neither a dissertation nor an assertion of any kind of truth.",

   "David Reznick at the University of California at Riverside. The work was done in Trinidad. The PBS series was more informative than the book. Both are more informative than the web site. For example, one finding was that guppies in streams with lots of predators lived \"fast.\" They matured sooner and reproduced sooner. I'm at home now and have the book, so I'll quote from it. Zimmer does a better job than I could.\n \nIn ponds with lots of predators, guppies that live fast should be more successful than slow-growing ones. With the threat of death hanging over a guppy, it will grow as quickly as possible so that it can start mating as soon as possible and have as many offspring as possible. Of course, this strategy comes with a heavy price. By growing quickly, a guppy may shorten its own natural lifespan, and by quickly giving birth to babies, a female guppy can't take time to supply her offspring with much energy, which puts them at risk of dying young. But Reznick reasoned that the threat of an early death offset these risks.\n \n That was the hypothesis. Reznick took downstream guppies from high predator ponds and transplanted them upstream where there were few predators. He watched them for 11 years. After that time they took 10% longer to mature and were 10% heavier by the time that they wee fully grown. They laid smaller broods of eggs that produced larger hatchlings.\n \n So I guess evolution is predictive.\n \n Ask Dr. Reznick about this. I'll bet that he likes to talk about it. It really is a perfect verification of the classic theory of Darwinian natural selection.\n \n I wasn't so enthuziatic about the Discovery program about the future of evolution that I made a note to watch it. With nothing better to do, I might have. I figured that there wouldn't be too much scientific basis for the program. But you know, whatever the public wants. Some will accept it as gospel. That's pretty sad.\n \n Well, maybe I have compressed time and it wasn't two years ago. It was in the last 5 years. The vaccine produced was ineffective against the predominant strain of flu. Since the production of the vaccine begins months before it is needed, by the time that it was realized that the predictions were wrong, it was too late. The amount of vaccine produced was insufficient to meed the need.\n \n Don't get me wrong. This wasn't like the epidemic of 1918 or even the one of 1955. Otherwise healthy people are not at risk unless there is a secondary infection - pnemonia for example. But the very young, the very old, and the very sick tend to be susceptible. My employer used to administer flu vaccine to any employee who wanted it. That year the program was terminated because of the reduced availability of the vaccine and thus the increased expense. Fortunately, my wife works for a doctor who gave me my fix for free.\n \n But the point is that there was a significant increas in mortality as a result of all of the above circumstances - failed prediction of prevalent strain, which caused late start on production of effective vaccine, which caused a shortage of vaccine when it was needed, which caused an increased mortality rate among the old, sick, and young. That presumes that they didn't get the vaccine because of cost and/or availability.\n \n But hey! Will of God. Right?",

   "Well, actually, the name I came across in looking through that PBS website was John Endler, here at UCSB. For our course in population genetics he used the examples of his work with guppies (which he has pretty much devoted his whole life to) as examples of the different methods one can employ to detect whether or not natural selection is occuring. With most of the models in population genetics we have been dealing with, virtually all are used to predict outcomes in biological systems. However, this approach by looking at how gene frequencies change over time it not what the general public will percieve as evolution, as show by that discovery channel documentary. I think most people, when they ask what evolution will predict, are thinking along the lines that so and so creature will evolve this and that appendage, and this creature will evolve wings, and so forth. While channels such as the discovery channel often have very informative programs( I'm addicted, thats for sure) sometimes when they produce stuff like that they do more harm than good to the general understanding of science \n \n About the flu: just clarifying what you meant by a bad strain. And 5 years ago sounds about right for there being that mishap with the vaccine and all.",
