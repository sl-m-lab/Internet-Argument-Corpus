   "(Springfield, Massachusetts) Hundreds of people attended a funeral Monday for an 11-year-old boy who hanged himself after enduring months of anti-gay harassment.Many of those who went to the church never met Carl Walker-Hoover, but his death and the reasons behind it have galvanized the western Massachusetts community.\n \n &#8220;The name calling must stop; the bullying must stop,&#8221; said the Rev. Hugh A. Bair in his eulogy.\n \n Reminders of the grade-six student surrounded the casket - pictures of him in happier days at school and on the football field and a set drums he played at home.\n \n The youth was found last week hanging by an extension cord on the second floor of the family home.\n \n His mother, Sirdeaner L. Walker, said that the New Leadership Charter School did nothing to stop the bullying, despite her repeated complaints to the school.\n \n The 11-year-old did not identify as being gay, but Walker said that he suffered taunts and threats from other students who made fun of him, insulted the way he dressed and called him gay.\n \n It was at least the fourth suicide of a middle-school aged child linked to bullying, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network said Friday.\n \n Earlier this month, the parents of a Mentor, Ohio, high school student filed a federal lawsuit in connection with their son&#8217;s suicide.\n \n Eric Mohat, 17, went home from school on March 27, 2007, put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.\n \n In a federal lawsuit, the parents of Mohat allege that he regularly &#8220;was called &#8216;gay,&#8217; &#8216;###,&#8217; &#8216;#####&#8217; and &#8216;homo&#8217; among other names&#8221; and that the school did nothing to prevent it.\n \n \n \n So how many more have to die before we do something people? How many more need to die before we wake up and see that this senseless hurt and pain must end?",
