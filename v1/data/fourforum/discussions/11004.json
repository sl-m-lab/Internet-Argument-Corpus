   "This came to me in an email this morning. I'd be interested in comments. Thank you, sincerely.\n \n I will be honest with you on this one.\n \n Either you believe it is right or wrong. Either you believe in the whole agenda or not.\n \n When gay rights first started, people were asking to just be acknowledged and accepted and to be allowed to live in peace as a gay person.\n \n People said OK. Then, activists started to think. \"well that is not enough\" and got in the face of people and started to become a bit more radical.\n \n They pushed for hate crime legislation based on a handfull of incidents, became a political lobby, pushed for civil union and finally marraige.\n \n Most people would have just let things go along just fine but then gays became flamboyant, holding parades, etc. It morphed from \"please accept our lifestyle\" to \"it is equal to yours\". In 25 years it turned from a mental dysfunction into a 'lifestyle' or 'life choice'. If people challenged\n the heredity validation, they name called and accused people of homophobia.\n \n It became an 'in you face' movement and many of us experience the mean lesbians that absolutely hate men. And yet, it upsets people that they are not unquestionably accepted and universally given so called 'equal rights'.\n Religion is challenged and dismissed because of it's tenants that fly in the face of homosexuality, etc.\n \n Gays are now a lobby and militant...that is the issue with social conservatives.\n \n I take the same kind of tact with this that I take with abortion....I do not want or need to know.....I do not want to give any gay any special rights......I do not want to financially support that agenda.\n \n I believe that you have the right to \"feel\" any way you want about anyone. I have never been at odds with any gay man with whom I have worked with or for. All of them knew that I was aware BUT all of them were low profile.\n \n When I say that I raise my children to believe that straight is the correct lifestyle it is no less insidious than a lesbian couple raising a child to believe that homosexuality is \"normal\". I do not call anyone a bigot \n because they teach their children that because that is their reality. I expect that no one would have disdain for me becaus I choose to do the opposite.\n \n If \"I don't really need to know or want to know\" is supporting the closet, then sorry.\n \n As I have said; biologically, anatomically and physiologically it does not figure...the only way it seems logical is 'emotionally'. It is your life and any other gay persons life....your choice....your emotions but we\n do not need to define it as equal and normal heterorsexuality as the qualifiers scientifically do not exist.\n \n As I have said, I accept it but I do not embrace it nor do I care for it's \"in your face\" militancy.",

   "The article is bull-doodoo.\n It may be possible that SOME people have such an experience in coming to their opinion, but I think those individuals are not getting the full picture.\n When it comes to the OVERALL picture of \"conservatives\" with criticism of gays, it's pure doodoo.\n \n How can I say that?\n For starters, take the claim that we *ask for too much* in perspective.\n Just a few years ago, we finally got sodomy laws pulled from the books.\n And CONSERVATIVES BALKED at the action.\n Does that sound like they were willing to allow gays as \"live and let live\"? When you've got a group of people who say your VERY SEXUAL ACTS with your partner is illegal, haven't you given up any pretense of \"live and let live\"?\n \n What about gays in the military? The law forbids ALL gays from serving in the military. The law doesn't give any exception for \"if you don't say you're gay, you can stay in\". Conservatives support the gay exclusion.\n \n \n It became an 'in you face' movement and many of us experience the mean lesbians that absolutely hate men. \n Who the heck has EVER REALLY come across this?\n This is a freakin' prejudicial stereo-type, and to see it in this \"article\" should be a red flag that the article is pure malarkey.\n \n \n When I say that I raise my children to believe that straight is the correct lifestyle it is no less insidious than a lesbian couple raising a child to believe that homosexuality is \"normal\".\n What a ridiculously false attempt at equivalency. The two are NOWHERE NEAR the same.\n Imagine if we flipped the situations.\n One parent teaches that GAY is the \"correct lifestyle\", and then the straight couple teaches that heterosexuality is \"normal\".\n \"Correct lifestyle\" implies that the \"other\" lifestyle is incorrect.\n \"Normal\" doesn't imply anything about morality.\n Teaching \"normal\" is nowhere near the same as teaching another thing is \"correct\".\n \n I would love to see the author's response if we challenged him to JUST teach his kids that being straight was \"normal\", and not say \"correct lifestyle\"... emoticon_emb \n \n \n This article reeks of skewed favoritism towards heterosexuality. And I am not saying that from on top of a soap-box, demanding that the person be burned at a stake.\n I am just calling it what it ACTUALLY is.\n \n Take the article and do something really quick.\n Substitute \"black\" or \"Jewish\" in for the word \"gay\".\n Ask yourself what type of person would condemn blacks as \"militant\" just because they want hate crime legislation.\n What type of person would accuse Jews of being \"militant\" just cause they wanted marital rights?\n \n The author is being absurd in his rationale. He's got a skewed view of \"equality\".\n He wants gays to have LIMITED equality, akin to the mentality of people who didn't mind blacks being free as long as they didn't try dating white people.",

In the years after World War II, gay people and organizations did seek to win wider acceptance for gay people, by attempting to counter the anti-gay propaganda and the myths and stereotypes about gay people that were widespread. The Daughters of Bilitis and the Mattachine Society worked to change the popular misconceptions and negative stereotypes of gay people in the 1950s. In 1965, gay rights activists picketed the White House in an effort to stop the arbitrary firing of federal employees who were suspected of or known to be gay. \n \n The Stonewall Rebellion in 1969 aimed to stop the police harassment of gay people for simply gathering in bars. This prompted the rise of more radical gay groups, notably Gay Liberation Front. The period from the late 1960s through the 1970s was the period of the most radical gay rights activism, with gay people challenging discrimination in employment as well as working for equal rights for women. I attended, in 1979, the first March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. \n \n It was after this that the gay rights movement's focus was largely redirected to the AIDS crisis, in the 1980s. \n \n In the last two decades, I think the gay rights movement has become more inclusive and less \"in your face\" than it was in the 1970s. The movement has sought to include transgender rights and has worked for simple equality under the law. Individual couples have pressed for the right to marry by bringing lawsuits, in some cases winning lawsuits. Gay servicemembers have worked to end the restrictions on gay people serving openly and equally in the U.S. military. High-profile hate crimes cases, especially that of Matt Shepherd, have brought the issue of hate crimes to public attention, but hate crimes laws have not been the principal issue for which gay equality activists have struggled. \n \n I do not know any lesbians who \"hate men.\" Most lesbians I know are either friends with men or are indifferent to men. Most lesbians I know have male friends, heterosexual, bisexual, and gay. The stereotype of \"man-hating lesbians\" is nothing but a stereotype. \n \n As for holding parades, there is nothing wrong with holding a parade. If you go to New York City on any given summer Sunday, you'll see one group or another holding a parade. Parades are fun. Marches are more politically powerful and meaningful than parades, I think, and having a march for equality is a positive thing. \n \n If some people are afraid of gay people marching or parading, they can always choose not to attend a parade or a march that they dislike. We will march and parade just as other people do. And we will be treated as equals. We fight for equality, nothing more and nothing less. Gay people are equal human beings, and we will be treated as equal human beings. That's the right thing to do.",

Lets stick to the topic.emoticon_cool\n\n Your actions have consequences.\n If you can't cope with that, it's not my problem.\n \n ========================================\n Edit:\n After reviewing more of the thread, I see that Matthew has seen fit to be the prime example of exactly what you were complaining about.\n Thank you Matthew for once more reacting with emotion, accomplishing nothing, and providing a negative speaking point for the anti-gay community.\n Hopefully your temper is sated, while you can't seem to accept the fact that you are just fanning the flames which will end up annoying you even more in the future...\n \n Most gays are not like Matthew.\n Matthew is an exception on this board, and quite frankly he is often rebuked by his fellow gay posters.\n \n So, Spicy, if you were talking specifically about Matthew, you don't need to prove anything to me. I find his comments repulsive as well.",

   "Replace \"blacks\" with \"people until 15\" and you will find many people agree with this.\n\n So restricting people's rights under the age of 18, because they lack the maturity for the responsibility, is akin to the desire to discriminate against gays?\n \n Oh wait. FIRST you were talking about DRUG DEALERS, so I guess \"people until 15\" fit under the same category as \"gays\" and \"drug dealers\", right?\n < end sarcasm <\n \n As usual, you're missing the point.\n The reason you don't acknowledge it as bigotry is simply because you DO NOT WANT to label it as bigotry.\n You approve of discrimination against gays, so therefore it's not bigotry.\n When you don't approve of the discrimination, then suddenly it becomes bigotry. \n \n KKK members don't classify themselves as \"bigots\", for exactly the same reason.\n \n And for one final and crushing difference?\n \"people until 15\" will eventually get their rights.\n A person who is 15 will be 18 in three more years, and get the right to vote, etc, etc, etc...\n Your prejudice against gays forbids gays from having equality. Forever.\n \n \n \nI don't see how we can't restrict marriage as we see fit...or for that matter, get rid of it.\n\n With that thinking, the Supreme Court would have had NO authority to strike down interracial marriage laws in 1967.\n In fact, NO state's supreme court could have struck down their interracial marriage laws, leaving them still in effect.\n \n The main reason interracial marriage was legalized is because the courts stated we could NOT blindly restrict marriage just on popular opinion.\n Such a stance provides little to no protection for rights.\n \n If the population \"sees fit\", then they can just vote people's rights away?\n That's no way to run a society that pretends to \"protect\" people's rights.",

   "So why should I have to be be expected to accept the disgusting hetero lifestyle?\n\n \n Why should we accept the disgusting homo lifestyle? And why is it OK for you to say that the hetero lifestyle is disgusting, but we cannot say that about your lifestyle without being bashed for being hateful?! And no one is saying you have to accept it, just keep your business to yourself. We don't have to accept your lifestyle either.\n \n \n \n Why do heteros have to push their lifestyle in my face? Why do I have to pay taxes to send the walking sperm products of their disgusting lifestyle to school? \n\n \n My goodness your thinking leaves a lot to be desired! Not to mention you are a product of walking sperm, made from the so-called disgusting hetero lifestyle, as well as whatever lover you have. If it wasn't for the hetero lifestyle no one would exist, because gays can't make children. But a man and a woman can produce a child. Plus, if you feel so strongly about children being walking sperm product of a disgusting hetero lifestyle, why are so many gays trying to adapt these walking sperm products?! So I guess your disgusted with yourself because you're a walking sperm product?! Plus, we don't push our lifestyle in your face. But if you go out into public,\"Oh my gosh!\" \"You're going to see straight people!\" So stay at home, or go to one of those gay retreats, are gay villages and live there.\n \n \n \n \n \nI don't agree with the hetero lifestyle I think it is nasty, disgusting, and sick, but I am legally forced to accept it and financially support it through the tax system. Bottom line is that If I am forced legally to accept heteros they must be forced legally to accept gays.\n\n \n here you go insulting the hetero lifestyle again. Now I guess I can insult your lifestyle. I think what you do is disgusting, and nasty, and sick. You're a hypocrite, you say why can't gays be able to pick who they love without being judged? Then why can't heteros pick who they love?! We love people of the opposite sex, why are you saying we are wrong?! But you want people to agree with you being gay right?! You are a hypocrite, and this attitude is what the person who wrote the E-mail was talking about.\n \n Also, taxes benefit everyone. Plus, it's more about the government getting their money, not really about the people themselves. So when you speak about taxes, your speaking about the greedy government. Not to mention that some gays have government jobs, and they would be quick to throw you in jail if you don't pay your taxes. So go ahead and strike if you want to. Don't pay your taxes for the right of all gays, I would love to see you hauled off for what you believe to be a huge injustice, to gays to have to pay taxes. If hetero people have to pay taxes so do gays. It has nothing to do with lifestyle,(you constantly show your ignorance.) it has to do with government, and their constant need for funds. And the last time I looked, gay children were going to school as well. So tax payers are paying for their education as well. If you don't want to pay for heterosexual children to receive an education, then I guess it is fair that we heteros should pull the gay children out of the schools so we don't have to pay for them right?! But then we would all be evil, and hateful if we did that huh? But you can do it to heterosexual children?! What a big joke!",
