   "We all like to believe we have the right answer no matter which side of this we are on, but in actuallity we dont. The anti side says more gun control is the answer, and we on the pro side say no. In reality, both sides have valid points at times, although sometimes someones answer is absurd to put it nicely. Banning gun ownership or making a law abiding gun owner conform to a law aimed at the criminal atmosphere is not the answer, no more than allowing a law abiding gun owner to carry WMD's is a good answer. I think both sides need to come to a \"live and let live\" attitude. If a person does not want to own or carry a gun then so be it, and if an individual does own guns then like wise. I own lots of guns and posses a CHL from my state of residence, and I had to go through the same background check as a person going through the academy to become a police officer, and even though nearly every day I hear about cops being arrested or put on leave, I am trusted less than they are, and I dont break the law so why am I less trusted? Is it a simple matter of a job title or something else? I feel like existing laws need to actually be enforced and new ones targeted at those they are created for and not at legal law abiding gun owners. Everything is not always black and white or exactly as it appears at first glance, we should all be held accountable for our actions. If a person is forced to use deadly force because he/she had no choice then he/she should not face persecution because they owned a gun and took a life with it, but if without just reason or cause a person takes a life or breaks the law such as armed robbery, rape,etc., then he/she deserves to be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Yet somehow these two types of gun owners have somehow became the same thing to a lot of people, just how I see it.",

   "Before we even begin this discussion of what should or shouldn't be done we have to face some simple facts. Regardless of their being any right answer the fact of the matter is that there's no simple answer. There's nothing that can just be thrown out there and used to address everything.\n \n The simple fact is that the system is broken and we know it. We have a prohibition against felons buying guns but they subvert this. They use family members or straw buyers to go through the background checks for them, or they buy from arms dealers in dark alleys or out of car trunks in secluded lots. We have records of who buys what guns and where but the list is simply of those that qualify as law abiding and serves very little benefit for the police because we have no way of knowing when, where or how a prohibited person becomes armed again after society disarms them. This is a problem because we're keeping tabs on the wrong persons.\n \n Performing background checks on buyers serves little real world benefit when there are so many ways for it to fail. False information, outdated records, the passage of time and untimely deaths of recorded owners all serve as obstacles that can lead to a case simply going cold.\n \n The system in place for tracking and recovering a weapon is wholly dependent on the existence of the serial number on the side of the gun but if this serial number is obliterated the system is useless. This is a well known problem that everyone is aware of and there's nothing we can do about it.\n \n As it is right now the system that we have in place seems more like its designed to catch otherwise law abiding people in a technical violation and punish them on the most trivial of matters, rather than finding and prosecuting known criminals who defy the laws and sidestep the legal hurdles we have in place. The names and addresses of people without criminal records serves little point in the hunt for a serial killer unless you're holding out beyond all hope of a million to one chance that maybe somebody broke the law and simply hasn't gotten caught yet.\n \n The system that we have is broken and we have to address that fact openly. Trying to make a broken system work harder in hopes that it'll work better will just make things worse than they are now. Adding requirements and stipulations to a fractured framework with an insufficient foundation is nothing more than a recipe for disaster.\n \n If we're going to get anywhere we have to take a mature approach to the problem. We can't look for quick solutions that make great headline grabbers or that can be blogged about on Twitter. If we're going to have any hope in a system that will have crime fighting benefits then we need to take a good, hard and in depth look at what we have, what the proposals for improvement are, see how they would work when faced with real world circumstances, and be prepared to contribute hard work for a solution that's actually workable. Simply going \"We need to take action A\" or \"We need to require more of action B\" isn't going to do any good.\n \n Like it or not we may have to face the ugly possibility that there's no way we can fix the system and thus there's no way we can stop or even hinder criminals from getting guns and using them. Just as we can't stop an earthquake from happening we may be entirely powerless to attack the criminal element with new laws and closer scrutinizing of the law abiding public. Like the war on drugs, the war on guns could be impossible to win and defeat may have to be admitted.\n \n As I said there are no simple answers. This isn't a summer blockbuster movie where one course of action will lead to the desirable outcome for the plot. There are simply matters that can't be won no matter how hard you try.",
