   "There have been a number of news articles telling how your movement is changing strategies toward legislative solutions in the NY area, in the wake of the recent court loss. I assumed you were familiar with that.\n\n Actually, no.\n And the vague description you casually toss out there does nothing to enlighten.\n Do you have a link to the specifics?\n \n \n \nRegarding your 2nd question, please don't be obtuse--you know what I'm talking about--your comments on how the majority should not infringe upon the rights of gays is one such example. You may be right on that in some cases, but it still seems hypocritical from my persepective for you to now TURN to legislative action.\n\n HOW is it \"hypocritical\"?\n Be specific.\n \n Quite frankly, the courts SHOULD recognize that the constitution protects our right to marriage.\n But if not, and we have to go through legislation to get the right to marry, then so be it.\n \n That's not \"hypocrisy\".\n You're only seeing \"hypocrisy\" when you result to such \"obtuse\" vague descriptions that it borders on being devoid of accuracy.\n \n \n \nFrankly, I think you know EXACTLY what I'm saying--you're just belaboring the point because you don't like it.\n\n No. I don't know what you're saying.\n And if you could ACTUALLY SAY it with precision, you would have done so by now.\n But instead, you have to stick to vague generalizations to pretend a hypocrisy is present just because you're ignoring details.\n \n \n \nYou were taking issue with my use of the term \"anything\"--I assumed you were thinking I was generalizing.\n\n Isn't the word \"anything\" a generalization?\n \n \n \nBecause I don't believe redefining marriage IS anyone's individual right.\n\n I didn't ask you what YOU believed.\n I asked you: \"Then WHY can't you realize that gays have the same perspective, but that we differ on what is defined as \"individual right\"...\n We state, with substantiation and precedent, that marriage IS a right.\"\n \n You routinely harp on what the anti-gay crowd \"believe\".\n Now, I am talking about what the pro-gay crowd \"believe\", and how we have a SIMILAR PERSPECTIVE (not all issues should be majority rule), but with DIFFERENT BOUNDARIES (gay marriage is one of those issues to us).\n \n \n \nI wasn't talking about the gay marriage movement's actions in THOSE cases, I was talking about it's actions in the case of MARRIAGE (which, by the way, is on par with the topic of this thread)\n\n Oh. I see.\n So when you said ANYTHING, you actually just meant ONE THING. Marriage.\n Makes perfect sense...\n emoticon_xdonno \n \n \n \nThat was Matthew's basic premise to begin with; I was responding to him by pointing out the counter-balance on the other side.\n\n I see no counter-balance, and you have been asked at least twice to BE SPECIFIC in your claim.\n For the anti-gay side, they have DEMONIZED the courts by referring to \"liberal activist judges\" and talking about how the courts are \"making laws\".\n But now, they turn to the courts to IGNORE the laws which specify what is required for a constitutional amendment.\n \n On the flip side, gays haven't demonized the legislature. We have condemned SPECIFIC LEGISLATION, but that isn't a parallel for the hypocrisy of the anti-gay marriage crowd. If we had condemned a specific piece of legislation as hypocritical, and then we tried to enact the same legislation, THAT would be hypocritical. But that isn't what is happening.\n \n I just EXPLICITLY showed why the anti-gay marriage crowd is being hypocritical. SPECIFICALLY.\n You still need to BE SPECIFIC in the \"hypocrisy\" you claim. You haven't done that yet.\n \n \n \nIt's been laid out--read my comments to Foundit\n\n No, Jyoshu, it HAS NOT been specifically laid out.\n There are TWO PEOPLE who are telling you that you haven't laid it out specifically.\n \n You COULD do the sensible thing and reiterate your SPECIFIC complaint.\n But I think we both know that you don't have one, and that is why you obfuscate the issue.",
