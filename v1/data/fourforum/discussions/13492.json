   "The CofE has been struggling to hold itself together for a few years now. The general decline in attendance has led to the rise of extremist voices taking a more dominant position within it's ranks.\n 7% of the population simply does not make a popular mandate, thus the church must conform to the general views of the establishment if they are to remain a viable part of it. Other Protestant churches (in particular evangelicals) dismiss them as sell-outs as a result.\n Now the Vatican has weighed in inviting traditionalist priests to join the Catholics. Has this in effect pressed the self-destruct button?\n Despite the proclamations of the Pope to oppose Secularisation has he just ensured that England becomes a Secular State?\n I think the numbers of transfers are being exagerated by both sides but if the Evangelicals gain control of the Synod the position of the CofE would be untenable and Disestablishment would likely follow the second General Election after the event.\n A fait accompli?",

   "Hardline Evangelicals and Anglo-Catholics remain a minority in both the pews and the Synod of the Church of England. This is clearly demonstrated by the large majorities in favour of the ordination and consecration of women, and by the tiny minority of congregations that have approved Resolutions A, B and/or C concerning the ordination of women and alternative espicopal oversight. In the event I imagine that few will leave the Church over the consecration of women Bishops, and if they did I imagine the influx of married clergy under a separate rite would be more of a problem for the Roman Catholic Church than the Church of England. A vast chunk of the population still identifies as Anglican, even if they do not currently attend church. The loudness of evangelical voices has a lot to do with money, as evangelical churches are by and large wealthier.\n \n The broad church majority has bent over backwards to accommodate the foibles of evangelicals and anglo-catholics, and the disputes have largely been about how to do this, not about whether ordaining women is right. Many who think women should be ordained have been willing to vote against it if those who disagree are not satisfied with the alternative provisions made. It's a difficult balancing act between allowing those who have been called to serve as priests and bishops to serve, and trying to avoid damaging the faith of those whose beliefs are different. ECUSA has taken the view that God's calling of individuals is more important, while Rowan Williams thinks that the unity of the church as the body of Christ, even while composed of different parts, is more important.",
