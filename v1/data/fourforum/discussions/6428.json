He doesn't want anyone to go there. However, God's holiness and righteousness demand that sin be punished. His very nature cannot allow sin into His presence. That's why He sent His Son. You see, When Christ was dying on that cross, all the sins of mankind were laid upon Him, as was the unbridled wrath of God. The worst thing that happened to Christ wasn't the crucifixion, it was God the Father turning His back on Him when He placed His judgement for sin upon His own Son. For example: a defendant on a misdemeaner charge stands before the judge. The judge pronounces sentence;\"$500 or sixty days.\" Then the judge does something remarkable: he removes his robe, whips out his checkbook, and pays the fine himself, Moral of the story; the defendant was his son! The judge knew that the penalty had to be paid for, but could not stand to see his son incarcerated. Therefore, because of the love for his son, he pays for the crime in his stead. You see, that's what the gospel message is. God paying for the penalty of our sin in our stead.\n \n \n \n \nNow that's odd. I thought b/a christians were supposed to believe that Eve had been beguiled by the serpent, who assured her it'd be OK. How was the dumb bunny supposed to know who to believe?\n\n That's wrong.

   "About half way down the page in the following link you can see some chariot wheels from your pet marsh. \n \n http://bibleprobe.com/exodus.htm\n \n Jesus is Lord!\n\n Commentary\n \n The \"Red Sea\" by which Moses led Israelites on their exodus from Egypt was not the body of water now called the Red Sea. The Hebrew word is Yam Suph, meaning \"Sea of Reeds.\" It is now believed that the Sea of Reeds \"was perhaps located at the S extension of the present Lake Mensaleh.\" (The Interpreters Dictionary of the Bible, Volume 4, Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1962, page 21) \n \n G. Ernest Wright (Biblical Archeology, Abridged Edition, Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1960, page 38) writes, \n \n ...They chose 'the way of the wilderness by the Reed Sea' (Ex.13.18) This, and not 'Red Sea', is the correct rendering of the Hebrew Yam Suph, and it is highly improbable that we should identify it with the northern arm of the Red Sea known today as the Gulf of Suez. In the first place there are no reeds in the Red Sea. in the second place the biblical account implies that the Reed Sea was the barrier between Egyptian soil and the desert: if the Red Sea were meant, it would have been necessary to cross a considerable traact of desert to get to it. In a text describing the wonders of Rameses-Tanis, however, mention is made of a 'Papyrus Marsh' near the city, a name which immediately recalls the biblical 'Reed Sea'. Thus the crossing was made not far from Rameses. This is confirmed by the identification of Baal-zephon (Ex.14.2) with Tahpanhes, the modern Tell Defneh, in the same region, on the basis of a Phoenician letter which mentions the god 'Ball-zephon and all the gods of Tahpanhes'. The reference in the account of Exodus willl be to the town which contains the temple of this god.\n \n A footnote in The Harper Collins Study Bible, New Revised Standard Version: with the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical Books (edited by Wayne A. Meeks and the Society of Biblical Literature, New York: Harper Collins Publisher, 1993, page 96) states: \n \n Red Sea, the \"Sea of Reeds,\" possibly one of the lagoons along the Mediterranean coast of the Sinai Peninsula;... Few of the geographical sites in the Exodus narrative can be identified, and it is possible the Red Sea is meant; although it is unrealistic here, it may have been adopted to present a later Israelite audience with a well-known body of water.\n \n http://www.bibletexts.com/terms/redsea.htm\n \n \n The Hebrew word soof means \"reed,\" while dam means red (yam means sea). Whenever the King James Version says, \"Red Sea,\" the Hebrew text says \"reed sea.\" The Strong's Concordance definition of soof also agrees with the Hebrew definition in my NTC Hebrew/English dictionary on page 480. If you have a Strong's Concordance, you will notice that the word \"Red\" in Exodus (as with every other mention of it as Red Sea in the Old Testament) is cross-referenced to the Hebrew with Strong's number 5488 - soof - a reed. According to Strong's, the word 'red' is used in the New Testament only twice to refer to the Red Sea. However, upon closer examination, the Strong's Greek cross reference for Red is Strong's Greek Number 2281 - (greek: thalassa - sea) - the same as the Strong's Greek cross reference for the word Sea - 2281! According to Strong's The New Testament Greek doesn't even make reference to the color red when referring to the Red Sea. The color red is Strong's 119, 122, 132, 923 and 2561 for Hebrew and 4449 and 4450 for greek - those are the colors 'red'- none of which are used in the term \"Red Sea.\" Perhaps the King James translators were attempting to uphold a tradition by adding in the word \"Red\" when it wasn't really there (in Acts 7:36 and Hebrews 11:29) The commentary on the Torah I have only refers to the \"Sea of Reeds\" for that reason; if the Red Sea was the Exodus author's original intent, yam dam (sea red, properly translated: Red Sea) would have been the words chosen instead of yam soof - sea (of) reed(s). \n \n While God can part an entire literal ocean if He wants to, that's not what the story appears to say in its original language as it reads in Exodus.\n http://www.mainemediaresources.com/mpl_Red%20Sea.htm",
