The determination of accurate calendar ages from radiocarbon ages requires a calibration curve, though, because the production of 14C and its distribution between atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial carbon reservoirs both vary with time.\n \n Charged with the task of producing the official calibration curve for terrestrial radiocarbon dating, the IntCal working group has just released the latest version, IntCal04. Reimer et al. present this new curve, which replaces the previous version that has been in effect since 1998. IntCal04 extends the calibration backward by 2000 years, to 26,000 calendar years before the present (cal yr B.P., where the present is defined as 1950), increases the resolution of the period earlier than 11,400 cal yr B.P., and considers the uncertainty in both the calendar age and the 14C age in the calibration. Tree ring data contribute the bulk of the ages in the interval between today and 12,400 cal yr B.P., and marine data from corals and foraminifera provide the calibration for samples older than 12,400 years. Associated papers in the same issue describe the details of this impressive and valuable achievement. -- HJS\n \n Radiocarbon 46, 1029 (2005).\n\n \n So how can evilutionists have any confidence in carbon dating if they keep updating the calibration curve?

Here, we use positional cloning methods to identify the major chromosome locus controlling armor plate patterning in wild threespine sticklebacks. Mapping, sequencing, and transgenic studies show that the Ectodysplasin (EDA) signaling pathway plays a key role in evolutionary change in natural populations and that parallel evolution of stickleback low-plated phenotypes at most freshwater locations around the world has occurred by repeated selection of Eda alleles derived from an ancestral low-plated haplotype that first appeared more than two million years ago. Members of this clade of low-plated alleles are present at low frequencies in marine fish, which suggests that standing genetic variation can provide a molecular basis for rapid, parallel evolution of dramatic phenotypic change in nature.\n\n \n http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/307/5717/1878\n \nPALEONTOLOGY:\n Ready for Their Close-Up\n A review by Hans Sues*\n \n Mammals from the Age of Dinosaurs Origins, Evolution, and Structure\n by Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, Richard L. Cifelli, and Zhe-Xi Luo\n Columbia University Press, New York, 2004. 648 pp. $195, \u00a3126. ISBN 0-231-11918-6.\n \n In the theater of Mesozoic terrestrial life, mammals have long been cast as bit players--mouse-sized, furry creatures leading furtive existences in the wings while dinosaurs chewed up the scenery. This traditional view may be questioned because mammals and dinosaurs were very different in terms of size and biology, and, aside from one occasionally feeding on the other, the two groups probably had relatively little direct interaction.\n \n The Mesozoic fossil record of mammals represents more than two-thirds of the group's entire evolutionary history and shows that they, like their dinosaurian contemporaries, rapidly diversified soon after their first appearance in the Late Triassic. The first announcement, in 1824, of the presence of mammals in Mesozoic strata (Middle Jurassic Stonesfield slates in England) shocked most scientists because it challenged then-prevailing notions concerning the succession of life through geological time. Additional discoveries through the 1860s, most also in England, quickly established the existence of a diversity of Mesozoic mammals, and in 1871 Richard Owen provided the first detailed study of these finds (1). In the second half of the 19th century, collectors working for Othniel Charles Marsh at Yale recovered a wealth of Jurassic and Cretaceous mammalian fossils in the American West. In the 1920s, George Gaylord Simpson reviewed all known Mesozoic mammals and published two major monographs on the European and American specimens (2, 3).\n \n Figure 1 Not just a dental record. The single specimen of Jeholodens jenkinsi is a nearly complete articulated skeleton and skull (from the Early Cretaceous of Liaoning Province, China). This eutriconodont probably weighed less than 30 g and fed mainly on insects and other invertebrates.\n \n CREDIT: MARK A. KLINGLER/CARNEGIE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY\n \n Research in the field was rekindled in the 1940s, with discoveries of early Mesozoic mammals in Britain. The pace of exploration accelerated in the 1960s. Unlike in earlier years, when finds of mammalian remains were usually an accidental by-product of the quest for dinosaurs, paleontologists now systematically searched for mammalian fossils, especially the durable and diagnostic teeth. New techniques for breaking down and screening sedimentary rocks made this effort more productive. At the same time, discoveries of scores of well-preserved skulls and postcranial remains in Late Cretaceous strata in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia by Polish-Mongolian expeditions led by Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska initiated major advances in our understanding of the skeletal morphology of several major clades of Mesozoic mammals. In 1979, Jason Lillegraven, Kielan-Jaworowska, and William Clemens edited a comprehensive survey of the structure and diversity of Mesozoic mammals (4), but such was the pace of research that much of the volume quickly became outdated. The most significant development in recent years has been the discovery of exquisitely preserved skeletons of various Early Cretaceous mammals in the Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province (northeast China), which have had a profound impact on our understanding of the origin and early evolution of marsupials and placentals.\n \n Clearly mammals were a significant component of many Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems. Yet their fossil record still remains sparse for much of the Mesozoic, and many issues remain unresolved. For example, the record is still too incomplete to test divergence dates for most of the principal lineages of placental mammals proposed by molecular evolutionary studies. Today the search for Mesozoic mammals continues worldwide, with almost every year bringing exciting new discoveries.\n \n Mammals from the Age of Dinosaurs, written by Kielan-Jaworowska, Richard Cifelli, and Zhe-Xi Luo, represents a much needed, authoritative survey of Mesozoic mammalian diversity and evolution. The authors, leading investigators in the field, have produced a landmark study that provides a phylogenetic framework for future work on mammalian history. (Kudos to the publisher for including the character-taxon matrix used for the parsimony analysis as an appendix to the text, rather than relegating it to an ephemeral Web site.)\n \n They view the phylogenetic tree of Mesozoic mammals as a \"bush\" of lineages, with successive radiations throughout the era. This picture differs from the fundamental dichotomy between nontherian and therian mammals favored by many authors since the 1970s as well as from Simpson's earlier concept of Mammalia as a grade comprising several lineages with separate origins among nonmammalian cynodonts. The most radical aspect of the authors' phylogenetic hypothesis is the dual origin of tribosphenic (\"reverse triangle\") molars, with a Southern Hemisphere clade (Australosphenida) that includes monotremes developing this type of cheek teeth independently from a Northern Hemisphere clade (Boreosphenida) that includes marsupials and placentals. Recently discovered Early Cretaceous fossils in Australia indicate that monotremes also developed the characteristic mammalian three-bone middle ear independently from therians.\n \n The authors devote the bulk of the volume to a comprehensive survey of Mesozoic mammalian diversity, one grounded in the wealth of their own primary studies. For each major group of Mesozoic mammals, they offer a concise review of the group's anatomy and paleobiology, followed by a synopsis of all known genera (each of which is diagnosed and illustrated). This makes the book a particularly useful resource for specialist and novice alike because the primary literature on the subject (covered in a 52-page bibliography) is vast, multilingual, and widely scattered.\n \n Like Simpson's classic studies, Mammals from the Age of Dinosaurs provides a solid foundation for the continuing quest to shed light on the extensive Mesozoic history of mammals, including the most distant roots of our own species.\n \n References\n \n 1.

   "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/307/5717/1885\n \n \nCELL BIOLOGY:\n Whither Model Organism Research?\n Stanley Fields and Mark Johnston*\n \n Almost everything we know about the fundamental properties of living cells--how they grow and divide, how they express their genetic information, and how they use and store energy--has come from the study of model organisms. These simple creatures traditionally include the bacterium Escherichia coli and its bacteriophage viruses, bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the mouse Mus musculus, each a representative of the diversity of life. Our colleague Gerry Fink has likened this handful of organisms to the Security Council of the United Nations because, among the world's multitude of organisms, they garner most of the attention of researchers and dictate the distribution of most of the biomedical research funds that are not targeted to specific diseases. A few other organisms--the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the mustard plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the zebrafish Danio rerio, and the frog Xenopus laevis--may qualify for seats on the council, but membership is limited. But has the very success of experimental approaches using model organisms made them (and the scientists who study them) endangered? Now may be an opportune time to ask: What more can model organisms tell us about fundamental biological processes?\n \n Three daunting issues confront biologists who devote their careers to studying model organisms. First, some of the most crucial questions have been answered, at least in part. Thus, we know a lot about the mechanisms that underlie the cell cycle; the cellular components that synthesize, modify, repair, and degrade nucleic acids and proteins; the signaling pathways that allow cells to communicate; and the mechanisms that lead to the selective expression of subsets of genes. Remarkably, the operating principles of these cellular processes have been conserved throughout the tree of life. Second, problems of human biology and human disease are becoming increasingly seductive. Given that the flow of information and molecules around individual cells is established, at least in outline, many biologists find more excitement in, for example, discovering how organ systems develop and function, how learning and memory operate, and how innate and adaptive immunity coordinate their responses. We want to understand how people get old, why they get sick, and what we can do about it. The intrinsic appeal of these topics is bolstered by encouragement from the National Institutes of Health and other funding agencies to conduct \"translational research,\" studies that directly address the prevention or treatment of disease. Third, the tools and resources that made uncomplicated model organisms so attractive to begin with can be applied increasingly well to much more complex creatures including mice and humans. Thus, we now have essentially complete mammalian genome sequences, an expanding resource of purified genes and proteins, DNA chips to measure gene expression, and vast numbers of DNA sequence polymorphisms to map traits such as susceptibility to disease. Perhaps most disquieting for the model organism researcher is the recent acquisition by mammalian biologists of a method that was once the sole province of those working on simpler creatures: facile elimination of gene function. The new method of RNA interference has leveled this playing field.\n \n So what does the future hold for model organism research? In the case of S. cerevisiae, the eukaryotic model organism with the smallest number of genes, we contend that it will be \"solved\" within the next 20 to 30 years. Of course, not every facet of yeast biology will be known: Precise biochemical functions will not be available for every gene product, the level of every metabolite will not have been measured under all possible environmental stresses, and the subtle effects of mutations on protein folding, stability, or modification will not be wholly predictable. But no basic molecular process in yeast will remain obscure. This is a remarkable accomplishment that should be celebrated. And if we expect to essentially \"solve\" over the next few decades a cell constructed from 6000 genes, how much longer can it be before we \"solve\" the fruit fly with only twice as many genes, or the roundworm with only about three times as many genes?\n \n The benefits that we will realize from these successes include a working blueprint first of a cell, then of multicellular organisms, that will enable researchers to decipher ever more complex biological processes such as tissue development, the immune response, and neurobiology. Because of the spectacular progress of model organism research, we can expect to reach a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of life. This Security Council, unlike its political counterpart, is proving to be a resounding success.\n \n That said, are we playing a dirge to model organism research or singing a paean to its reinvention? We are singing, because we believe that the hegemony of model organisms in biological research will persist. We see at least five reasons why.\n \n 1) Over the coming few decades, model organisms will continue to provide insights into replication, transcription, translation, protein secretion, metabolism, and many other aspects of cell biology, biochemistry, and physiology, because they offer the keenest methods of analysis. In fact, the value of model organisms will only increase, because the human geneticist who identifies a disease gene implicated in a conserved cellular process will turn to these models to provide deeper insights into the function of that gene. And that researcher will discover a rich encyclopedia of knowledge that can be drawn upon for formulating incisive experiments to illuminate the disease process.\n \n 2) Model organisms will increasingly be used for the direct investigation of medical problems that seemingly have little to do with them. For example, the misfolding or aggregation of proteins implicated in the process of neurodegeneration in disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, can be recapitulated in yeast, worms, and flies. In addition, other components discovered in these organisms may be important in the disease process. Analysis of aging in simple models is turning up genes that play analogous roles in more complex organisms. Model organisms will provide further insights into the cell cycle and cancer, glucose metabolism and diabetes, chromosome segregation and mental retardation, protein glycosylation and lysosomal storage diseases, mechanisms of drug action and resistance, and much more. Studies of S. cerevisiae will help us to unravel the workings of its pathogenic cousins such as Candida albicans; studies of D. melanogaster will reveal secrets of the Anopheles mosquito.\n \n 3) Model organisms will remain at the forefront for the foreseeable future in efforts to sort out biological complexity and achieve a more quantitative understanding of life processes, which is needed to unravel the network of molecular interactions that constitute an organism as complicated as a human. For example, it is with yeast that biologists first will elucidate how DNA binding proteins, DNA sequence elements, components of the transcriptional machinery, chromatin structure, and signaling pathways combine in the circuitry of gene regulation. The resulting comprehension of biological networks that will result will bestow upon biologists the predictive powers and design capabilities long held by physicists and engineers. Such insights will require the application of multiple technologies, the confluence of individual investigator's experiments and genomewide data sets, and the intense collaboration of experimentalists and computational biologists. Learning how to carry off this ambitious project is itself a lofty goal of model organism research.\n \n 4) Model organisms offer the best hope for coming to grips with the breadth of genetic diversity and the depth of its consequences. Most of the variance among individuals of a species is due to small differences in multiple genes, and it is with model organisms that we will first learn how to analyze and understand complex quantitative traits. Such an understanding will provide the principles and procedures for predicting disease susceptibilities in humans and tailoring optimal methods for prevention and treatment. Genetic diversity is the grist for the mill of natural selection that produced the remarkable diversity of life on Earth, and model organisms should continue to teach us about the origin of the species.\n \n 5) Model organisms will remain the proving ground for developing new technologies, which typically spread quickly throughout the research community. For example, our skills in isolating and manipulating genes were won while studying bacteria and bacteriophages. Many other technologies got their start or achieved their apogee in yeast, including two-hybrid analysis, high-throughput protein purification and localization, genomewide epistasis analysis (synthetic lethality), gene expression profiling, protein arrays, and genomewide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Worms and flies have been the test beds for large-scale RNA interference screens. We don't see these developments abating. Indeed, the more the fund of knowledge of simple organisms grows, the more useful they become for subsequent technological innovation.\n \n But will an organism like yeast be able to maintain its seat on the Security Council? Not indefinitely. And just as yeast has led the way in many areas of research, we expect that its fate as an experimental organism will foreshadow that of the rest of the council. Does this mean that the end of biology is near? Hardly. We will still be a long way from a comparably deep-seated understanding of humans and our afflictions. How do cells and organs regenerate after damage? How do eukaryotic parasites, which are so different from model organisms, wreak havoc with fatal diseases like malaria, African sleeping sickness, and Chagas' disease? How do strange bacteria and viruses elude our immune systems and stymie our best efforts at drug therapy? How do genes and the environment interact in behavioral diseases like schizophrenia or autism? What is the basis of memory and consciousness?\n \n The reductionist approach of biologists has enabled remarkable achievements by causing us to focus on just a few experimentally tractable organisms, but it also has tended to restrict our vision. There is much to learn about the many organisms that populate our planet, most in ways we can't yet begin to fathom. How do creatures survive in extreme environments? How do some manage to metabolize bizarre substrates? How do individuals organize themselves into incredibly complex communities? This list of questions seems endless (as seemed the list of genes in model organisms not so long ago). Providing adequate answers to these and many other questions is certain to occupy us for a long time. And the knowledge and sophisticated analytical tools that model organism research has laid at our feet bring the entire General Assembly of organisms within our reach, enabling us eventually to answer a question that has framed our enterprise from its beginning: What is life?\n \n References and Notes\n \n 1.

Isaacs, William J. Blake, James J. Collins*\n \n Consider a high-tech version of the \"telephone game\" in which you and a group of your friends attempt to transmit a message via your cell phones. One person in the chain has a phone from the 1990s, which is very noisy. Another person is standing in the middle of Times Square in New York City. It would not be surprising if the message received by the person at the end of the chain, or cascade, were corrupted as a result of noise intrinsic to the old phone and the noise arising from the Times Square environment. In this issue, Rosenfeld et al. on page 1962 (1) and Pedraza and van Oudenaarden on page 1965 (2) investigate a living-cell version of this game by exploring how signals are transmitted through gene cascades in noisy cellular environments.\n \n Cell phones consist of multiple, interacting components. Engineers characterize the performance of such devices by determining quantitatively the input-output relationships, or transfer functions, of the respective components. Rosenfeld et al. present a new method for calculating the transfer function for the expression of a single gene. Specifically, they investigate the relationship between the concentration of active transcription factor (input) and the rate at which target protein is produced (output) in single cells. They define this relationship as the gene regulation function. To experimentally measure the gene regulation function, they constructed a synthetic \"lambda-cascade\" system (see the figure) in Escherichia coli, in which the expression of a target, or output, gene (CFP, cyan fluorescent protein) is modulated by the activity of an input transcription factor (CI-YFP, lambda repressor fused to yellow fluorescent protein). This scheme allows simultaneous measurement of both input and output protein levels in vivo, and is well suited to quantitatively derive the gene regulation function.\n \n Figure 1 Synthetic gene network cascades. (A) Gene network used to determine gene regulation function (1). TetR represses the expression of a CI-YFP fusion protein, which, in turn, represses the expression of CFP. The chemical anhydrotetracycline (ATC) modulates repression by TetR, and the \"regulator dilution\" method was used to control the concentration of CI-YFP. (B) Time course of slow (top) and fast (bottom) fluctuations can both result in similar population distributions (right). (C) Regulatory connections and noise sources for a synthetic gene cascade used to study noise propagation in gene networks (2). LacI represses the expression of TetR, which, in turn, represses the expression of YFP. CFP and YFP fluorescent reporters were used to measure noise properties of the network. Unregulated expression of red fluorescent protein (RFP) was used to measure variability due to global sources of noise not influenced by the properties of the network. \n \n To vary the concentration of the CI-YFP input protein, the authors used a \"regulator dilution method\" in which a given amount of regulator is systematically decreased through successive cell divisions. As the level of CI-YFP decreases, the production of the CFP target increases. By analyzing binomial errors in protein partitioning, the authors obtain the relative fluorescence intensity of individual protein molecules, which allows them to determine the apparent number of molecules per cell. This information was used to determine the gene regulation functions for individual cells, from which a mean gene regulation function was calculated for a select population.\n \n The gene regulation function was subsequently used to extract a number of system-specific properties. For example, the mean gene regulation function was fit to a Hill function to calculate in vivo values of several biochemical parameters. These values were used to provide a molecular-level representation of a transcriptional input-output relationship in individual cells. Interestingly, these values were comparable to previously calculated in vitro estimates.\n \n Rosenfeld and colleagues noted significant deviations of single-cell gene regulation functions from the calculated mean gene regulation function. The authors detected and quantified the effects of factors such as cell cycle phase and gene copy number on these deviations. After compensating for these sources of noise in the analysis, the authors examined whether the variability of the gene regulation functions arises from random fluctuations in other cellular factors that globally affect gene expression (extrinsic noise), or from fluctuations in the biochemical processes involved in the expression of an individual gene (intrinsic noise). Consistent with their previous work (3), they detected only a minor noise contribution from intrinsic factors, implicating extrinsic factors as the prominent noise culprits.\n \n In contrast to previous experiments that collected steady-state snapshots of gene expression (3-6), Rosenfeld et al. measured temporal changes in the rates of input (CI-YFP) and output (CFP) production levels. The authors noted that fluctuations occurring on different time scales can lead to identical steady-state distributions (see the figure). They also found that intrinsic noise decays rapidly, whereas single-cell responses depart from the mean gene regulation function over long time periods (about one cell cycle), indicating that extrinsic noise can occur on slow time scales. The authors suggest that cells would have to integrate signals over long time periods to account for such noise, which means that there may be a trade-off between accuracy and response time of a transcriptional network. Feedback, as noted by the authors, can be used to affect this trade-off, as has been demonstrated experimentally in studies involving both positive (7, 8) and negative (9, 10) feedback loops.\n \n A complementary study by Pedraza and van Oudenaarden (2) investigated the input-output relationships of genetic circuits. To investigate how noise propagates through a gene regulatory cascade in single cells, the authors designed a synthetic network in E. coli. They arranged three genes in a cascade with two regulation steps in which the lac repressor (LacI) modulates the expression of the tet repressor (TetR), which, in turn, regulates the expression of YFP (see the figure). CFP was coexpressed with TetR to measure the variability in TetR expression. Pedraza and van Oudenaarden systematically perturbed the effective regulation along this cascade by using the chemical inducers IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside) and ATC (anhydrotetracycline). This method allowed them to investigate how interactions among network components affect the transmission of noise along the cascade (see the figure).\n \n As the repressive effect of LacI was decreased by the addition of IPTG, its target, CFP, responded with an increase in expression. Expression of the downstream YFP target in the next regulatory step was inversely correlated to the CFP signal, but it exhibited a much steeper response. These results illustrate that genetic cascades can display sharp, switchlike responses to input signals, a recognized property of analogous protein kinase systems (11).\n \n The experiments also showed that the two fluorescent reporters in the cascade, both regulated by single repressors, display strikingly different levels of noise in their response to varying strengths of regulation. To interpret these results, Pedraza and van Oudenaarden developed a stochastic model of their cascade that distinguished between various sources of noise influencing the expression of each gene (see the figure). Importantly, the authors included in the model contributions from transmitted noise, that is, intrinsic and extrinsic noise influences transmitted from a regulator gene to its target.\n \n The model demonstrated that expression variability of a target gene in the cascade was most influenced by noise transmitted from the upstream regulator. This interesting finding suggests that network connectivity can have a greater effect on the variability of expression than noise intrinsic to the expression of a gene itself. Remarkably, the authors' model was able to accurately predict the noise properties of single genes within the cascade, as well as correlations between each of their fluorescent reporters, demonstrating that such behavior can be described in a quantitative manner.\n \n In similar recent work, Hooshangi et al. (12) constructed gene regulatory cascades of varying lengths in E. coli to explore the effects of cascade length on the timing, variability, and sensitivity of the network's response. They found that the sensitivity of the network's response to changes in an input signal increased with cascade length, similar to the results discussed above (2, 11). Moreover, they showed that longer cascades, which are more sensitive, amplify cell-cell variability, especially at intermediate signal levels. Noise due to high levels of expression in genetic cascades can also have dynamic effects, with phenotypic consequences. For example, an earlier study involving a synthetic gene regulatory cascade in yeast (5) showed that increased variability in an upstream regulator can cause a cell population to display prolonged bistable states of gene expression.\n \n To date, studies of synthetic gene regulatory networks have relied primarily on qualitative models that describe general system behavior (13). The work by Rosenfeld et al. (1) and Pedraza and van Oudenaarden (2) represents an important advance toward a more quantitative synthetic biology. These studies offer insights into gene regulation, and, together, provide a framework for the further characterization of input/output relationships among regulators and their targets. These quantitative approaches can be applied to natural gene networks and used to generate a more comprehensive understanding of cellular regulation. This will enable a better characterization of individual genetic components and modules, opening up the possibility of designing more complex synthetic gene networks.

In the biological sciences, barriers to synthesis--including the specialization of subdisciplines and their fractionation into departments and curricula--have increased over the past few decades. Developmentalists dissect their favorite ecologically irrelevant models with exquisite detail, while evolutionists tap away at hundreds of fascinating species with genetically toothless tools. Organismal biologists can take great solace in a report on page 1928 of this issue by Colosimo and colleagues (1) that shows how genomics can be used to buck this trend and lead us to new insights into fundamental evolutionary problems.\n \n The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a finger-sized species of fish that exhibits multiple examples of parallel evolution. The threespine stickleback populations that inhabit the streams and lakes of the northern Pacific and Atlantic rims show intriguing variations in morphology and behavior compared to marine populations (2). A particularly striking instance is the reduction in body armor exhibited by freshwater populations. Whereas marine sticklebacks carry a row of up to 36 armor plates extending from head to tail (complete morph), freshwater sticklebacks either carry a gap in the row of plates (partial morph) or retain only a few plates at their anterior end (low morph). Sticklebacks reside in diverse freshwater habitats that include numerous glacial lakes in western Canada that were formed as the last ice age retreated 10,000 or so years ago (3). Lindsey hypothesized in 1962 (4) that rather than a single stickleback population with reduced body armor founding the populations in all of these lakes, parallel evolution must have occurred. He attributed parallel evolution to selection either on independent mutations or on a rare allele whose phenotypic effect is cryptic, that is, remains hidden in the marine population. The new study (1) combines quantitative genetics, genomics, population genetics, molecular evolution, field studies, and molecular developmental biology to demonstrate that both new mutations and cryptic variation have contributed to body armor reduction. In so doing, this study provides one of the first dissections of a skeletal polymorphism to the gene level, and thereby elevates the stickleback to the status of supermodel for the study of developmental evolution.\n \n Figure 1 Lightening the load. Marine threespine sticklebacks (blue) have a robust set of body armor (indicated as multiple rays in each body), whereas multiple freshwater populations on either side of the north Pacific rim have independently lost their body armor during the course of evolution. Each low-morph stickleback population in lakes and streams of western North America carries an Eda allele (red coloration) that resembles the rare allele found in marine populations. This finding suggests that the Eda allele has increased in frequency under adaptive selection. By contrast, a Japanese marine population has a different Eda allele on the common background, implying that this case of armor reduction evolved through an independent mutation.\n \n CREDIT: PRESTON HUEY/SCIENCE\n \n The story begins with high-resolution linkage mapping of a major effect locus for armor reduction in a cross between \"complete\" and \"low\" body plate morphs of the threespine stickleback. This locus was mapped to an approximately 0.7-cM interval of the genome. Although expression of the phenotype varies in different crosses because of the segregation of modifier loci, loss of body plates is largely dependent on a generally recessive allele that accounts for as much as 75% of the difference between morphs (5). To positionally clone the gene responsible for this effect, Colosimo et al. (1) performed a chromosome walk across the region of interest, tiling six bacterial artificial chromosome clones covering more than a megabase. Half of this walk was completely sequenced, and microsatellites at 12-kb intervals were typed in a set of 46 of the complete-armor morphs and 45 of the low-plate-number morphs from an interbreeding stream population in California. This so-called linkage disequilibrium approach--now the standard in mapping human disease genes--reduced the peak of the candidate interval to just 16 kb, centered on a marker in the second intron of a gene called Ectodysplasin (Eda).\n \n Eda encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of secreted signaling proteins (6). The gene has a history of involvement in abnormal development of skin. Mutations in this gene cause a variety of human syndromes (7) and the Tabby phenotype in mice (8); meanwhile, absence of the EDA receptor results in loss of scales in medaka fish (9). Similarly severe mutations in these genes in natural populations would be likely to have such deleterious pleiotropic effects that selection would preclude their reaching high frequencies. Sequencing of a low-morph Eda allele detected multiple nucleotide differences with respect to the complete-morph allele, but only four of these led to an amino acid change in the EDA protein, and none of these changes obviously affected EDA's function (1). Thus, the precise polymorphism that leads to the quantitative skeletal phenotype is still unknown. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction methods detected the expected alternative splice products in both morphs of stickleback, but because the transcript abundance in developing epidermis was too low to detect by whole-mount in situ hybridization, it is not yet clear whether there is a quantitative or spatial difference in expression that might explain the phenotypic effect of the low-morph allele.\n \n It remains possible that Eda is not the causative gene, particularly because the refined interval includes another TNF ligand and two other genes of interest (these may also, or alternatively, influence a couple of correlated physiological traits). Kingsley's group (1) has established more direct evidence for the involvement of EDA in plate development by generating transgenic sticklebacks that transiently overexpress a murine version of the gene. A handful of these fish exhibit partial rescue of plate development in a homozygous low-morph background. Thus, there is little doubt that Colosimo and co-workers have nailed the source of parallel morphological evolution in the threespine stickleback to a single gene.\n \n The authors next performed a population survey of Eda genotypes to address the question of whether adaptive evolution has favored multiple independent mutations or repeated selection of an allele that is rare in marine populations (see the figure). All of the North American and European low-morph populations share a haplotype consisting of a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms covering the interval centered on Eda, whereas the Japanese low-morph allele is clearly distinct. Because the Japanese allele fails to complement the North American one, this implies that at least two independent mutations have led to a reduction in body armor on either side of the Pacific. By contrast, detection of at least 14 instances of a similar haplotype in North America--one that is rare in the marine population from which the stream and lake populations of Canada and California were founded--strongly implies a single genetic basis for these instances of parallel evolution.\n \n Counting up the number of nucleotide substitutions between the two sequenced high- and low-morph alleles suggests a date of 2 million years for their separation, which is two orders of magnitude longer than the inferred age of the postglacial populations. This method does not actually date the causative mutation, which could have arisen on the low-morph haplotype at any time before the founding of the freshwater populations in which it has risen to a high frequency. The haplotype has an estimated allele frequency of 0.6 to 3.8% in populations of marine fish sampled from coastal British Columbia and California. This is too low to produce an appreciable number of homozygotes, but large enough to create a pool of alleles that would be available for selection upon introgression into freshwater environments. Preliminary sequence comparisons suggest that the causal site itself is quite ancient, as there is considerable diversity even within the low-morph haplotype. Had the mutation appeared relatively recently in an isolated stream, then found its way back into the marine pool from whence the other populations were founded, sequence diversity in the haplotype would be much lower than that observed in the prevalent marine haplotype.\n \n Ancient or recent, the more important point is that for the first time we have a clear demonstration that after alteration of environmental circumstances, adaptive evolution can act independently on an allele that is present in but has little effect on the morphology of the ancestral species. Colosimo et al. (1) refer to this phenomenon as selection on cryptic variation. A more technical definition of cryptic variation allows us to expand the scope of the potential impact of standing variation on rapid morphological evolution (10). In marine sticklebacks, the low-morph effect is hidden by the fact that only rare fish carry the relevant allele, and these fish are heterozygous rather than homozygous for the low-morph variant. Strictly speaking, though, cryptic variation refers to the situation where the phenotype of individuals is modified by the genetic background or environment such that a previously neutral variant becomes functional and adaptive. Because plate reduction is modified by other loci (5) and may be influenced by environmental factors such as calcium concentration in the water, it is likely that more than just selection on Eda is contributing to the uncovering of this hidden variation.\n \n These results should provide fuel for those who wish to emphasize the distinction between soft and hard selection. Hard selection--positive selection on new mutations--is known to lead to a substantial reduction in nucleotide diversity around the focal site, which can be used as the basis for detection of selective sweeps (11). By contrast, soft selection acts on standing variation that has been in the population for some time, as a result of a change in the environment or genetic background (both of which should occur when marine sticklebacks admix with those inhabiting streams). It is expected to leave a very different genetic footprint (12, 13), and this system provides a superb opportunity to contrast these scenarios. There is also a lovely symmetry in the fact that the mouse Tabby mutation, now known to be due to a mutation in the Eda gene (8), provides a classic example of canalization (14). Canalization refers to the buffering of genetic variation and promotes the maintenance of cryptic variation.\n \n Studies such as that by Colosimo and colleagues highlight how the disparate branches of biology can be synthesized to provide fresh perspectives on fundamental evolutionary phenomena. The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (15) in Durham, North Carolina, has just received NSF funding to promote synthetic research. Few groups have the capacity to pull off such an integrative accomplishment, but there is little reason why interactive teams cannot contribute to the emergence of numerous other supermodel organisms.\n \n References\n \n 1.

   "To have faith is to put trust in what someone else says.\n\n No.\n \n Well, ok, in the broadest definition of the word \"faith\" it's just a synonym for \"trust.\" \n \n I have faith that you can accomplish your goals, or I have faith in my partner's faithfullness, etc. \n \n If that's what you mean, then so be it.\n \n But Faith, in the religious sense, to me, is believing or trusting something that could never possibly be verified. The thing you have faith in may very well defy logic and the facts. This is religious faith, which to me is very different than plain trust.\n \n But, really, science is not based on trust. \n It's based on facts, facts that can be independently verified.\n If an experiment can't be reproduced, then it's not worth much.\n If someone fifty years from now can't read your paper and reproduce your results, then the paper isn't worth much.\n \n People don't put faith in other's results, especially competitors.\n A competitor would like nothing more than to prove you wrong.\n It's difficult to do when you have your facts straight and they have been independently verified. No faith is necessary for someone to \"believe\" the results. They see the results with their own eyes.\n \n Now, lay people do have to \"trust\" these people that they are not in some grand conspiracy to .....\n \n You knowI don't know what the purpose of the grand conspiracy would even be...\n \n But anyway, if you chose not to \"believe\" what they have written or what they say, they never threaten you with eternal damnation.\n \n \n \n \n \n As for publishing results, Isnt the bible a publication from a source as credible as any scientist? \n\n No.\n \n Because \"results\" in the Bible can never be independently verified.\n The bible isn't something that can be challenged and refuted in a scientific way.\n We can philosophize and dream about ways to verify its contents, but this would be the same process we'd go through in \"verifying\" a book of philosophy or metaphysics.\n \n We can't physically reproduce the \"investigations\" or \"experiments\" done in the Bible.\n \n The Bible just says \"This is the way it is, I am the Lord.\"\n A scientific paper says, \"These are the conclusions we've drawn about this particular natural phenomenon. The reason we think this is because of these experimental results or these investigative results, and here are the results spelled out piece by piece, step by step.\"\n \n \n \nThey found Noahs Ark, and the anchor stones used on it. They also found the house that Noah and his wife lived in after the flood, and there gravesites. \n \n If these ancient gravesites could be verified to be particular individuals, like Noah and his family, which is highly unlikely, this would be a valid scientific endeavor. It would be, what, archeology? anthropology? I would be the same as reading some ancient Egyptian texts about a prominent individual and seeing evidence that a particular gravesite belonged to this individual.\n \n BUT! Doing this in no way supports the occurence of a global flood.\n There would have to be a broader base of evidence to support something like that.\n \n \n \nThere are pictures on the internet and a detailed account of the expeditions, as well as the samples of the petrified timbers of the boat, and the slag used as ballast in the hull of the boat. some of the tests were conducted at a lab in los alimos.

The 1988 Willis expedition and the 1989 Aaron/Garbe/Corbin expedition used GPR. The 1988 Willis expedition successfully surveyed the eastern summit plateau and the saddle area between the two peaks, concluding there were no Ark remains under the ice. The 1989 expedition was not as successful as the preceding year, where a less-capable GPR system was used in temperate (melting) ice cap conditions on the western plateau of Mount Ararat. However, they were able to determine the ice depth on the western plateau and scale the size of the Ark.\n\n \n http://www.noahsarksearch.com/ararat.htm\n \n canadianman, just give it up.

   "You can call the los alimos research lab that did the assay on the sample of the petrified timber if you want. Mayabe they are \"Hacks\" as you put it.\nI presume you mean Los Alamos National Laboratory. I did a search of the LANL site and couldn't find anything about this assay of petrified timber. As I recall, one researcher who was involved with Wyatt examined this \"petrified timber\" and found it to be just plain old rock. Maybe if you could give some additional information - when was the assay done, by whom, where were the results published?\n \nSteven Hawkings, and Albert Einstein believe God exists. They must be a bunch of flakes and hacks. Thanks for clearing that up!\nI presume you mean Stephen Hawking. In one of his books Hawking talks about his belief in an unchanging and everlasting universe as a young man. In other words, his early views were that God is unnecessary. His views have changed and Hawking now sees a begining for the universe, but he doesn't see it as the personal whim of God. \"But you still have the question: Why does the universe bother to exist? If you like, you can define God to be the answer to that question.\" I think that maybe Hawking's God doesn't support your position.\n \n And Einstein stated that his God was the God of Spinoza. I think that if you look into that you will find that this particular God doesn't support your position either. In fact, Spinoza was decried as an atheist during the 18th century.\n \nWe better throw out the theories of relativity put forth by einstein! Hey everybody! This man is a genius! He discovered that Einstein is a fraud! Thank the heavens!\nHow is the theory of relativity relevant to God or the fraud of Ron Wyatt? Pointing out that you have allowed yourself to be duped by a fraud has nothing to do with Einstein, his beliefs, or his scientific work.",

   "http://members.aol.com/Heraklit1/einstein.htm\n \n \n \n \n Albert Einstein was born 1879 in Ulm. After graduation in 1900 he worked as a patent clerk in Bern, conducting research in physics in his spare time. In 1905 he published five papers that transformed the course of physics and established his reputation as one of the foremost scientists of his age.\n \n From the first world war on Einstein was a committed pacifist and anti- nationalist. Soon after Hitler became chancellor, he left Germany and joined the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. So convinced was he that Hitler was planning war that he went against his pacifist leanings. He advised free Europe to re-arm, and wrote to Roosevelt urging the US to undertake research into the atomic-bomb.\n \n Einstein died in 1955. He is best known for the theory of relativity, which states that time, mass and length all change according to velocity. Space and time are a unified continuum, which curves in the presence of mass. \n \n The last three decades of his life were devoted to the search for a field theory which would unify gravitation and electro-magnetism.\n \n Einstein always said that he was a deeply religious man, and his religion informed his science. He rejected the conventional image of God as a personal being, concerned about our individual lives, judging us when we die, intervening in the laws he himself had created to cause miracles, answer prayers and so on. Einstein did not believe in a soul separate from the body, nor in an afterlife of any kind. \n \n But he was certainly a pantheist. He did regard the ordered cosmos with the same kind of feeling that believers have for their God. To some extent this was a simple awe at the impenetrable mystery of sheer being. Einstein also had an urge to lose individuality and to experience the universe as a whole.\n \n But he was also struck by the radiant beauty, the harmony, the structure of the universe as it was accessible to reason and science. In describing these factors he sometimes uses the word God, and sometimes refers to a divine reason, spirit or intelligence. He never suggests that this reason or spirit transcends the world - so in that sense he is a clear pantheist and not a panentheist. However, this reason is to some extent anthropomorphic, and to some extent involves Einstein in a contradiction.\n \n His religious thinking was not systematic, so he never ironed out this discrepancy. But it seems likely that he believed in a God who was identical to the universe - similar to the God of Spinoza. A God whose rational nature was expressed in the universe, or a God who was identified with the universe and its laws taken together. His own scientific search for the laws of this universe was a deeply religious quest.\n \n Einstein's attachment to what he once called `the grandeur of reason incarnate' led him into the longest battle and the greatest failure of his life. He was implacably opposed to Niels Bohr's interpretation of quantum physics. Bohr believed that matter was fundamentally indeterminate, and our knowledge of it limited to probabilities.\n \n Einstein's comment, \"God does not play dice,\" became notorious. The phrase uses the present tense, not the past. This suggests that Einstein was probably not referring to the fact that a creator God would not in the beginning have created a universe in which chance reigned supreme. Rather he may have meant that as God or reason incarnate, the universe could not be governed by chance alone.\n \n Einstein believed till the last that quantum physics was incomplete: he was sure that one day an explanation would be found which would explain the causes of the apparent indeterminacy and once again make it plain that the universe was governed by laws. So far this has not happened.\n \n Perhaps if Einstein had sought more consistency in his own religious thought, and had been less concerned with a God who embodied human ideas of reason, he might have learned to be excited by indeterminacy. Then he might have come to see indeterminacy as another manifestation of the mystery, creativity and playfulness of Being.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n and....\n \n http://www.tricity.wsu.edu/~dcarrell/einstein/quotesaboutgod.htm\n \n \n Einstein Says \n \"Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.\" [pg. 153, Calaprice, Quotable Einstein] \n \n \"I believe in a Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the harmony of all that exists, but not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and actions of human beings.\" Telegram to a Jewish newspaper, 1929; [pg.147, Calaprice]. (Spinoza believed the more one studies and understands the universe the better one understands God)\n \n \"I can not accept any concept of God based on the fear of life or the fear of death or blind faith. I can not prove to you that there is no personal God, but if I were to speak of him I would be a liar.\" [pg. 58, Mayer, Bite-size Einstein]\n \n \"Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe - a spirit vastly superior to that of man...In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort, which is indeed quite different from the religiosity of someone more naive.\" [Letter to a child who asked if scientist pray, January 24, 1936; pg. 152 Calaprice] \n \n \"I cannot believe that God would choose to play dice with the universe.\" or sometimes quoted as \"God does not play dice with the universe.\" [pg. 56, Mayer]\n \n \"I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves. Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts. I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world, together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the Reason that manifests itself in nature.\" [Albert Einstein, The World as I See It American Institute of Physics Online]\n \n In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of the priests.\" [pg.153 Calaprice] \n \n \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.\" \n [Albert Einstein, 1954, from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, Princeton University Press] \n \n \"I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals, or would directly sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation. I cannot do this in spite of the fact that mechanistic causality has, to a certain extent, been placed in doubt by modern science. [He was speaking of Quantum Mechanics and the breaking down of determinism.] My religiosity consists in a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality. Morality is of the highest importance -- but for us, not for God.\" \n [Albert Einstein, from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, Princeton University Press] \n \n \"What humanity owes to personalities like Buddha, Moses, and Jesus ranks for me higher than all the achievements of the inquiring and constructive mind.\" [pg. 56 Mayer]\n \n \"The priests, in control of education, made the class division of society into a permanent institution and created a system of values by which the people were thenceforth, to a large extent unconsciously, guided in their social behavior.\" [\"Why Socialism\" by Albert Einstein, Albert Einstein Online]\n \n \"The relativity principle in connection with the basic Maxwellian equations demands that the mass should be a direct measure of the energy contained in a body; light transfers mass. With radium there should be a noticeable diminution of mass. The idea is amusing and enticing; but whether the Almighty is laughing at it and is leading me up the garden path - that I cannot know.\" [Letter to Conrad Habicht in 1905, pg. 196 Folsing, Albert Einstein: A Biography]",

I continue to live my life in accordance with the principles that Jesus taught.\" Perhaps THAT could be considered supporting evidence, as it would directly confirm, in Hawking's own words, your claim that he is a devout Christian.
