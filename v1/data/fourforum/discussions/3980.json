   "In any real-world business situation poor planning and lack of ability to effectively respond to market conditions would result in the responsible person being unceremoniously sacked. \n \n Iraq, the bottomless financial quagmire now being presented to the public as democracy in the ME, is the largest failure we're achieved in quite some time. Regardless of the future, isn't someone other than taxpayer wallets going to take the fall for such an immense disaster? Or is Rummy, as with many other administration posts, being retained because of his loyalty to the administration and the party, rather than discarded for his well-displayed incompetency?",

   "I believe Rumsfeld is still with the administration for a variety of reasons\n \n 1. Loyalty to GWB and his towing of the party (neocon) line. Loyalty and affermation of the party line is apparently very well liked in the current admin. As seen by the expulsion of Powell and the promotion of Rice. Powell while loyal, (see UN speaches) did not always affirm the presidents policies. Ie Yes Mr President Iraq will be easy to defeat and the Iraqi people will love you for destroying their country.\n \n 2. Rumsfeld deflects some of the heat from the president and his administration's polices and takes it on himself. The mainstream press can blame Rummy for the problems in Iraq and not blame Bush. Rummies and Iraq can also deflect attention from other problems or faluires. ( economy and OSB for instance). Consider the fact that the election in Iraq is rapidly approaching and by all apperances it will either be called off or have massive fraud ( cant have Sistani gain control can we) Rummy will be a perfect target to blame for the faliure.\n \n 3. Timing, when an incident is to big for the american people to ignore Rummy can then take the full heat leaving the rest of the Bush admin relatively intact.\n \n 4. Finally I am starting to feel that the current conditions in Iraq are the ones the Bush administration wants. The Iraqi people are not \"pacified enough\" to allow for the US government to keep most of its reforms passed by Bremmer to be maintained by an effective and strong independant Iraqi government. A weak Iraq and Iraqi people will not be able to threaten the new future of the ME that it appears is the goal of the US admin. Having Rummy there as part of the disinformation package being sold to the public again helps prevent a more in depth investigation into the way Iraqi is being run.",

This administration is not willing to admit in any way shape or form, that we were mistaken, or have misjudged, or have misconducted any aspect of the Iraq war.
