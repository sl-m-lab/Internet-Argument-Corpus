   "I actually brought this up in a post back in '05. \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=6647\n \n The case is fairly similar and is pretty famous considering the guy goes around giving speeches about it.\n \n In the end, both parties, in my opinion, screwed up wrecked each others lives. \n \n I really suggest people read the first post in that thread...in fact, I'll post it here as a quote.\n \n \nI heard a talk yesterday that many of you might have heard at a college campus near you. It was about a girl and guy code named \"amy\" and \"todd\". This was an actual case that happened some 10 yrs ago and the story is now told by a lawyer who was in the case.\n \n To make it some what short...\n \n Amy was a 5'4\" 125lb girl who was 19 and went out drinking on her college campus. She went to this one house at 11pm where she had 5 beers very quickly. Around 12am she met a guy named Todd who was a 6'0\" tall guy around 180lbs. The two began to hit it off and they danced for awhile. Todd asked Amy if she wanted some jello shots and Amy replied yes and Todd came back with 2 jello shots around the 12:30 time frame. The jello shots are special because Todd had helped back them with Everclear (90% alcohol). AMy had 2 and then Todd said that she requested some more. After the 5th one (at this time close to 2am) Amy ran outside throwing up. Todd had just gone away for a second and when he came back he went to find her. He found her outside throwing up and Amy asked to be taken home. Todd agreed and took her back to her home. Todd began to leave when Amy called back and asked for a glass of water...Todd agreed and gave her the glass of water. He then proceeded to leave again. Then Amy said \"wait\" and grabbed him and gave him a big kiss which led to some more... Any then ran off to the bathroom where she began to throw up some more. She came back BRUSHED HER TEETH and the two started to go at it again. Before they were about to engage in sex, Amy said she didn't want to because she might throw up everywhere. Todd said he was \"beyond the point of no return\". Amy still said no and Todd agreed. Amy then said she would get some rest until she felt better and then they would finish what they started. Todd testified that he sat for 20-30min watching TV while Amy was \"passed out\". She then woke up and said she FELT A LOT BETTER. She then began to make out with Todd again and the two engaged in sex at this point. Afterwards Amy went to bed and Todd left his name, number, and a note saying he had a wonderful time and wanted to see her again. The next morning Amy woke up hung over and saw the note. She didn't remember anything from last night and asked her roommate if she met a guy named Todd. Her roommate said \"no\" because her roommate was out all night. AMy then called the number and Todd, excited to see she called back so quickly, answered. Amy was confused and said she remember nothing. Todd then explained everything that happened between the two. Later on, because Amy was a virgin at the time, she went to the hospital on the advice of the police and later charges were filed against Todd for sexual assualt in the 2nd degree.\n \n Is Todd Guilty?\n \n If you know this case please don't give it away.\n If you have questions, ask me.\n \n The Law:\n Someone can't consent to sex if the person has reason to believe the other is MENTALLY INCAPACITATED or if the person SHOULD KNOW the other is MENTALLY INCAPACITATED.\n \n It is important to note a few things:\n 1) Being drunk is not mentally incapacitated. SEE LINK\n http://4forums.com/political/showpos...2&postcount=35\n 2) It is what the OTHER person(Todd) SHOULD HAVE KNOWN or DID KNOW at the time...not what was the actual state of Amy now that we know.\n 3) They engaged in sex around 5:30am...3hr30min after she threw up the first time (which was after the 5th jello shot)\n 4) Mentally incapacitated means the person doesn't have the ability to make rational judgements or think in a rational manner.\n 5) She did \"consent\" and did partcipate in the sex...there is not question here about \"no\" meaning \"no\"..it is more about \"yes\" meaning \"yes\"\n 6) He was a Bartender partime\n \n I'll lt some discuss it for a bit before I tell you guys the verdict and outcome.\n \n The audience I was in had 600 people...it was 50/50 for those that thought guilty or not guilty....Gender, race, or age didn't seem to matter in this figure.\n",
