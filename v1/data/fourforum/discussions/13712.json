   "A cloud over the Church: the Barna group reports that American Christianity doesn't look like Jesus \nCriticism was not limited to young people outside the Church. Half of young churchgoers said they consider Christianity to be judgmental, hypocritical and too political; one-third said it was old-fashioned and out of touch with reality. Of the group surveyed, 91 percent of young non-Christians and 80 percent of young churchgoers say that present-day Christianity is \"anti-homosexual.\"\n \n \"As the research probed this perception, non-Christians and Christians explained that beyond their recognition that Christians oppose homosexuality, they believe that Christians show excessive contempt and unloving attitudes towards gays and lesbians,\" the Barna report stated.\n \n Young Christians who took a critical attitude towards the Church said that it has made homosexuality a \"bigger sin\" than anything else. They believed that their churches had not given them any real help with their LGBT friends and relatives.\n\n \n About the Barna Group: \nThe Barna Group is a firm based in Ventura, California. It consists of five divisions focusing on primary research (The Barna Research Group); communications tools (BarnaFilms); printed resources (BarnaBooks); leadership development for young people (The Josiah Corps); and church facilitation and enhancement (Transformation Church Network)... According to the Barna Group, \"The ultimate aim of the firm is to partner with Christian ministries and individuals to be a catalyst in moral and spiritual transformation in the United States. It accomplishes these outcomes by providing vision, information, evaluation and resources through a network of intimate partnerships.\"\n The Barna Group - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

   "Ruth and Naomi's loving relationship is explicit if viewed without narrow dogmatic blinkers.\n \n \n Ruth and Naomi -- The Bible's female same-sex... | Gather\n\n \n Realizing this is a waste of time, I will attempt to educate you anyway from an actual biblically accurate spiritual source, in opposition to the propaganda piece you posted. \n \n Preference and Providence\n \n They emigrate and take foreign wives.\n \n Ruth 1:1-5\n \n From the national and religious viewpoints, it was treacherous for an Israelite family to move to a neighbor country. Although the patriarchs roamed as foreigners in the Middle East, the situation changed when God gave the Promised Land to Israel. Then Canaan was their God-given inheritance, and they had to stay loyal to their God and their country.\n \n In those days, gods and country were closely linked. Moving to another country was equal to moving to the gods of that country. When Elimelech (My God is king) left Bethlehem (house of bread), he denounced both names by seeking bread from the god of Moab because his God had not provided bread in Israel. One mistake led to another. When his sons married Moabite women, the planned short visit became an unforeseen long stay.\n \n Most likely, Elimelech and his family would have been forced by Moabite law to attend human sacrifices to their idols. Often the victims were small children. Every time they unwillingly attended such a senseless public killing, they got sick in the stomach and sad in the heart. \"What are we doing in a place like this?\" they asked themselves. However, these horrible scenes were later overshadowed by the personal grief of death in the family. As she stood at the graves of her husband and sons, Naomi wondered if they had been punished for coming to Moab. Their dreams had turned into nightmares.\n \n From God's viewpoint, the move to Moab resulted from lack of faith, and it exposed them to pagan worship. Nevertheless, Yahveh would weave it into His plan of salvation by bringing Ruth into the ancestry of the Messiah. Satan removed a family from the holy lineage; God replaced it with another.\n \n Emigration is tough. Anxiety about the future is mixed with grief about the losses of the past. The culture shock in the new country-with foreign values, customs, rules, and language-makes immigrants feel alien and aggravates their yearning for the old country. Today the pain of immigration is alleviated by protections (like freedom of religion, social security, and health care) and by contacts (with expatriates, new friends, and family by visits, phone, and e-mail). When one realizes that the whole earth belongs to the LORD (Ps. 24:1) one can worship the true God anywhere in truth and in spirit (John 4:23-24).\n \n As we try to steer our lives according to our goals, God is using the good and the bad in our lives to bring us to the place He has prepared for us.\n \n A prayer: God, keep me on the course You have in mind for me.\n \n A thought: Do I ask God to direct my path, and do I obey?\n \n \n \n 128. Loyal unto Death\n \n Your God is my God.\n \n Ruth 1:6-18\n \n The three widows persevered in the same small house every day. They knew each other's sorrows and struggles. Realizing their words did not really comfort, they supported each other with gestures and favors. Although Naomi felt that God had brought much bitterness into her life, she kept clinging to Him. After she had lost her husband and two sons, there was no one else to cling to.\n \n When the night was at its darkest, the Morning Star rose. Naomi got the news that the drought in Israel had been broken. The harvests were promising. She decided to swallow her pride, return to her hometown, and admit that their emigration to Moab was a total disaster. When she shared her plans with her daughters-in-law, Orpah and Ruth, they decided to go with her. Having been married to Hebrew men, their future in Moab was bleak in any case.\n \n Naomi must have been somewhat at a loss about this reaction. She allowed them to accompany her while she searched her heart and mind for the words to handle the situation. She did not expect a hearty welcome for herself in Bethlehem-but how would people react if she brought two Moabite widows with her? When they approached the border, they rested for a while, and Naomi spoke her mind while her eyes swam in tears.\n \n She thanked Ruth and Orpah for their love and support, urging them to return to their land and culture. When this argument did not convince them, Naomi shifted to a personal and practical level: their chance for remarriage. Time was against them. Naomi was too old to have more sons, and even if she could, Orpah and Ruth could not wait for them to grow up. Orpah realized the truth of Naomi's words, kissed her farewell, and turned back.\n \n But Ruth would not give in. When Naomi encouraged her to follow Orpah's example and return to her people and her gods, it brought Ruth to profess her loyalty to Naomi, her people, and her God: \"Wherever you go, I will go; and wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God, my God. Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried.\" Faithful unto death.\n \n Naomi could not argue with Ruth's devotion. They looked into each other's eyes with genuine love, hugged, and proceeded on the long uphill road from the Jordan valley to Bethlehem. Although Naomi appreciated Ruth's loyalty, she had no idea about the exhilarating events ahead of them. The flickering Morning Star would be followed by a brilliant dawn.\n \n A prayer: Lord, I want to be loyal to You unto death.\n \n A thought: Am I loyal to family, friends, and God?\n \n In typical fashion you corrupt and pervert the truth in order to serve your sick philosophy. Ruth didn't have a lesbian relationship with her own mother in law Naomi. The very idea of it is ludicrous on every level of rationale. Yet you think nothing of promoting such an irrational lie. You prove your disdain for the truth by claiming that the accurate interpretation is narrow and dogmatic. emoticon_rolleyes\n The story of Ruth",

I have quite a few men in my life that I have a deep brotherly love for. But the bible very clearly delineates between a platonic intimacy between two men and a homosexual expression of same gender sex. \n \n Your link seeks to ignore the difference between these expressions which are very clearly described and defined in Gods word so no amount of compromise will change that reality. And your continued and tiring insistence that the antiquity of the bible somehow negates its authority simply boggles my mind. I mean, after all of these thousands of years and the educational and technological advances throughout the civilized world and please tell me which social upheavals existed then which humanity has extinguished for good!!! \n \n Go ahead LA, enlighten me as to the social inequities which no longer exist like war, starvation, disease, poverty, or rape, murder, greed and selfishness. How about the hunger for power which afflicts humanity and causes one man to attain it at the expense of others he must step over to reach his goal for personal wealth and power. Tell me what has changed today over two thousand years ago with human nature in this spiritually dead and dying world. \n \n And if you can't show any change between now and then apart from the inventions which make only some of our lives easier, then why do you dismiss the wisdom of the ancients who so aptly and accurately defined these same sins and struggles which fallen man is still dealing with? How can you be so sanctimonious and arrogant as you look down on us for trusting that wisdom, when everything you stand for still represents everything it opposed then as well as now?",

That initiative was the states constitutional procedure for determining if the PEOPLE wanted to redefine marriage by allowing homosexuals to marry. It didn't take any existing rights away at all. It simply determined NOT to expand marriage or redefine it to include for special rights to the homosexual community. So stop perverting what occurred in California and repeatedly stating that that vote took any existing rights away from homosexuals. It only confirms for us that you are either dishonest or ignorant or both, which is my opinion of what you represent since you always repeat these lies which paint homosexuals as victims rather than the militants they truly are, in reality.\n\n \n The ballot initiative was put on the ballot by mean people that hate gay people. It was put there because they hate us, our families and want us to suffer. It was put there by religious nut cases who believe that their heterosexual privilege and religious beliefs are more important then the religious beliefs of gay Christians and those religions that fully accept and celebrate gay people and our families. And before you accuse Jason of not knowing the truth, they tried to get all rights, including domestic partnerships included in the initiative but couldn't. So don't kid yourself that this was only about marriage. In the minds of religious nut cases they hate us totally and want us to suffer. Anyone who does not support same sex marriage and full equality for gay people is mean, nasty, and hates us.\n \n IT all comes down to this; I am being denied the right to a secular state legal contract because someone else has some ancient evil religious belief that has no connection to the state.",

   "I really have to say I disagree Matthew there is a simple boundary between a stance on an issue and misguided hate. Many of the voters were swayed out of fear of the unknown...\n \n Think about it. If no one in your family is Gay or no one who is Gay is a co worker or someone you interact with and you know very little about Gay people would that not make you a target for this type of political play?\n \n Simply put, many of the general public do not know nor want to know about a gay person or gay culture... \n\n \n Speaking for myself (and I suspect at least reflecting the feelings of many, many other people), knowing a gay person and seeing that they do so many normal things isn't going to make me abandon my religious beliefs and throw my conscience to the wind. That would be immoral for me to do. It's not that many of us ' don't want to know' a gay person or gay culture; rather it's that our religious beliefs are dear to us--and religion trumps knowing a gay person when it comes to determining whether a given behavior is moral or not. Think of some given action that YOU would consider immoral: would merely getting to know someone who sometimes engaged in such activity just make you abandon your belief that said action was immoral? More importantly, why should anyone expect you to? You strike me as a person of principle, so surely there are things that you would hold steady on when it comes to moralistic matters, and you would not abandon your beliefs. You really can't expect religious people to turn their backs on their beliefs and just throw their moral views out the window. And frankly, I don't think they should be expected to.\n \n IMO there are two reasons other than hate for \"opposition\", not just one: there's the \"not knowing\" that you point out, but second, there are all the folks (many, many of them) who truly don't hate gays, but simply hold to the traditional religious moral view about same-gender romance/sex. IMO, based on my observation, that's the mainstream place most of your \"opposition\" is. I've used this analogy before, but Amish people hold to the view that using electricity and electronics is something that shouldn't be done--but we don't go around insisting they hate people who use it, nor is there a big pride movement set on vilifiying Amish people for doing so. Just like Amish hold to a religious view that may not be rational at all, indeed even HARMFUL in some cases (yet who are we to say it is or isn't anyway?), many religious people hold to the view that gay relations is wrong because that's part of their religion. You can no more expect religious people to abandon their views on this than you could demand Amish people abandon their beliefs on using electricity. IMO at some point, the gay pride movement is going to have to accept the reality that it's often not hate or 'ignorance' that's behind this, but basic religious belief, and stop flinging accusations of hate when it's so often not that at all. Until they do, they are simply going to continue inadvertently ostracizing themselves as a movement. The irony is that not acknowledging this and only chalking things up to hate or ignorance as the only two possibilities is to leave out the biggest and more common basis of \"opposition\" there is! The bottom line is that this non-hateful religious belief on this is here to stay, whether your movement learns to live with it or not.",

   "There can only be 2 reasons why gay people should be denied to marry.\n 1 that it is an abomination to God\n 2 that it would be bad for society.\n \n Well number 1 is all well an good but not really applicable to a secular society.Anyway everone else seems to be allowed to take their own path to hell!\n\n \n I am inclined to disagree with point one. For several reasons. Being that number one is that it was perceived in an action that did not benefit the population of Israel, and that is was perceived only in a form of worship toward another deity...\n \n The cultural and archaeological evidence behind these scriptures support this...\n \n \nNumber 2 is ridiculous. young people are shacking up together, having babies out of wedlock etc etc .\n Gay marriage would not endanger the nuclear family any more than having babies out of wedlock does.\n \n I do have an issue about gay union being called 'marriage' but I also resent the word 'gay' being stolen...but that probably says more about me...\n \n \n I believe that Christians have every right to remind sinners that they sin.\n We should respect that but society is changing.\n I believe the acceptance of gays into western society has more parallels with the emancipation of women than racial equality\n\n \n \n So would you then be supportive of civil unions with all the legal benefits of marriage being granted to gay couples?",

   "Frankly, their your beliefs keep them to yourself. Don't let them interfere with national law.\n\n \n No, people don't have to 'keep their beliefs to themselves' anymore than you have to keep your beliefs to YOURself. This is America, and like it or not, you don't automatically get to change law or determine what views get to be spoken. People need to get away from this idea that they have some entitlement to no-opposition toward their pet issues. Gay pride groups seem to want to have such leverage against religious groups, but the minute a religious person dares speak publicly about HIS or HER beliefs on this and the way they feel America should be, the implication they are given is that they should have no voice whatsoever. Religion has never meant one can't participate in the process.\n \n If you don't want religious groups effecting national or state law, then that's fine. But fight them in the process rather than this invalid approach I see so often that tries to tell them 'you shouldn't even be influencing law.' After all, YOU get to try and influence laws, and so can they. That's only fair. EVERYone wants their views to be what guides the country. That's why we have a system of voting and so forth. To undercut that by telling one group they can't due to your overly-zealous views on church and state separation is flat out un-American.\n \n \nYour trying to a paint these issues as a dire matter against your faith which it's not. There are thousands upon thousands of Christians who support gay rights and equality, I see them marching with us as congregations in pride parades...\n\n \n And that really brings up another point that I find fascinating ....\n \n Supposedly these Christians aren't supposed be trying to affect law, right? (Religion! State! GASP!) But you don't seem to have a problem with THESE Christians (the ones marching with you) doing it. The reason is obvious: because they're fighting for an agenda that you LIKE. So it's either one way or the other. If you're going to accept Christians who fight to influence law that FAVOR your agenda, you really have no basis to claim that Christians who oppose it can't have a voice or political influence.\n \n \nIf you are somehow trying to equate gay rights to say those of a pedophile or a rapist and try to bridge the gap in some way it won't work it is a slippery slope effect...\n\n \n I said no such thing. And I find those comparisons invalid and offensive, and have come out against them in the past when other posters make such comparisons.\n I do however, think that it needs to be understood that for religious people this is indeed very much of a moral issue.\n \n \nSo you judge once again upon one element of people, what they do in the bedroom. Why don;t you look at people from another perspective? I'll tell you why. Because you don;t WANT to. It doesn't personally effect you.\n\n \n I said nothing about 'judging' them. It's simply a matter of the moral code I and many others hold to (and believe is best for humanity) says not to do it. I'm sure there are things I do that your moral code would not be favorable to. We all have moral standards, Jason, that we feel is best to influence state and govt. in whatever way we feel is right. EVERYONE is influenced by their morality in how they vote or what they support. That's the way it works. You can't expect voters to sterilize themselves from the source of their views.\n \n Re. your comment about thinking about it from another perspective, I've done that many times. \n \n \nYou don't care if someones marriage is in jeopardy because you just don;t like the idea in the first place.\n\n \n The only thing that is in 'jeopardy' is this new entitlement your movement is trying to engage in to come along and piggy-back off another group's institution. You're talking about taking other things and being able to fit them into the \"marriage\" category, legally speaking. Broadening marriage. And this ultimately is a discussion about govt. benefits, not marriage in the sense of 'love' or 'relationship'.\n If you feel what you have is a marriage, then so be it--stay married. You don't need the state to commit to someone. I'd be married to my wife with or without the state. No one's trying to take away what you call your marriage. You can have a gay commitment ceremony, live with them the rest of your life if you want to. That's your business, I don't care. Obviously I don't agree with it, but I would never support imposing on you to in such a way that would prevent it. But I do care when people start tinkering with institutions and broadening them to include whatever comes along people want to call a 'marriage.' Because then you're just screwing around with legal institutions and we're essentially setting a precedent to opening them up to anyone and everything for any sort of relationship that comes along.",

I'm sure there are actions some people you know do that you don't approve of, but that doesn't mean you hate them or judge them as a person. Seriously, I think you understand where I'm coming from here, so I can only assume that when gay pride proponents act all offended at this, there are being purposefully belligerent. The concept of disagreeing with an action without condemning the person isn't exactly that above and beyond common sense. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nIt is one thing to base your influence of belief and how you vote.

You clearly do not understand how a marriage works or how such laws benefit a couple otherwise you may realize it is not that simple....\n\n \n You can call it anything you want. \n If you make a commitment to someone, it's your business whether you stay with them or not. State-benefits are a different subject. Don't conflate the commitment/love issues with legalities here. Whether or not you get govt. benefits or not has nothing to do with who you love as a person.
