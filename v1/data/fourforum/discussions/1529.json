   "Detroit named America's fattest city\n Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick has committed something of a cardinal sin in the motor city by blaming cars and trucks for Detroiters' bulging waistlines. \n \n \"It's probably something to do with the culture,\" Mr Kilpatrick told local journalists, when asked about a report that Detroit had passed Houston to take the title as America's fattest city. \n \n \"We're not a walking city,\" Mr Kilpatrick said, adding that this was because Detroit is \"the automotive capital of the world.\" \n \n Detroit's international auto show, the industry's biggest yearly event and a celebration of all things automotive, opens on Sunday. \n \n An annual list of the 25 fattest US cities will appear in the February issue of Men's Fitness magazine. \n \n Houston held the top spot on the list for the past three years. \n \n --Reuters\n as reported at\n http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s1020001.htm\n \n \n What are you doing? Are you going to let Detroit come out on top? Pick up a hotdog and do something about it.",
