Obama's pastor has been spewing that filth about white people for decades, in alot of that time Barry Obama has been absorbing the dung spewing from that man's mouth. Doesn't it seem a little suspicious that he didn't leave that church until the presidential elections... at all?\n\n \n The only reason BHO spent so many years in that church was because it was politically expedient for him at the time. Wright's church was plugged into the liberal activism in Chicago. He doesn't have a spiritual bone in his body, at least for Jesus or Christianity anyway. He proved that at the Saddleback Forum when he said that determining at what point an unborn baby is alive, is above his pay grade. He told every believer who heard him say that everything they needed to know regarding his spiritual depth. \n \n And here is the latest (an excerpt) on his islamic heritage.\n Obama's Ties to Islam\n \n Obama's ties to Islam are hereditary. His father was a Muslim, though Obama claims he was nonpracticing. According to Islamic law, Obama was born a Muslim, as religion is passed paternally. (Judaism, for example, passes religious identification maternally.)\n \n Apparently in deference to his father, his full name, Barack Hussein Obama, is an Arabic name. The name Barack is a derivation of \"Barak\" -- the horse that took the prophet Muhammad on his flight into heaven.\n \n Though Obama&#8217;s biological father disappeared from his son&#8217;s life soon after he was born and returned to his native Kenya, he was raised by his Kansas-born mother and her second husband, an Indonesian who was also a Muslim.\n \n Obama has described his mother as a Christian, but Newsweek recently noted she had eschewed her parents&#8217; faith in favor of secular humanism.\n \n Obama&#8217;s mother and her Indonesian husband moved with young Barack from Hawaii to Jakarta, Indonesia&#8217;s capital, in 1967. Obama lived there from ages 6 to 10.\n \n Reports dating back as far as early 2007 held that Obama was educated at a radical Islamic school in Indonesia. Such reports are false. He never attended such a school.\n \n In fact, Obama first attended a Catholic school for almost three years. However, his mother registered him in the school as a Muslim. As such, he was required to spending time each week praying with Muslim students and studying the Koran.\n \n In the wake of the controversy over Obama's Muslim upbringing, The Los Angeles Times sent a reporter to Jakarta to ferret out the truth.\n \n The Times report, published on March 16, 2008, revealed:\n \n A close boyhood friend of Obama, Zulfin Adi, said Obama \"was a Muslim. He went to the mosque.\"\n Obama's first-grade teacher at a Catholic school, Israella Dharmawan, said: \"Barry (Barack's nickname) was Muslim. He was registered as a Muslim because his father was Muslim.\"\n In the third grade, Obama transferred to a public school, where he was also registered as a Muslim. At the school, Muslim students attended weekly religion lessons about Islam.\n Some of these details have been confirmed by Obama himself. In his autobiography, \"Dreams From My Father,\" Obama mentions studying the Koran and describes the public school as \"a Muslim school.\"http://www.newsmax.com/headlines/obama_muslim_mccain/2008/09/07/128559.html\n \n And here's more on Obama's buddy Khalid Mansour and his islamic connections. http://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/khalid_al_mansour/2008/09/04/127844.html",

If Americans are ignorant enough to actually entrust America's top job to Obama, then we deserve whatever we get as a result. http://mediamatters.org/items/200802270006\n Following Obama's answer, Russert asked, \"Do you reject his support?\" Obama then replied, \"Well, Tim, you know, I can't say to somebody that he can't say that he thinks I'm a good guy,\" adding: \"I have been very clear in my denunciations of him and his past statements, and I think that indicates to the American people what my stance is on those comments.\" Russert continued, stating: \"The problem some voters may have is, as you know, Reverend Farrakhan called Judaism 'gutter religion.' \" Obama replied, \"I am very familiar with his record, as are the American people. That's why I have consistently denounced it.\" Indeed, in his answer to Russert's initial question, the first thing Obama said was, \"You know, I have been very clear in my denunciation of Minister Farrakhan's anti-Semitic comments,\" calling them \"unacceptable and reprehensible.\"\n \n Russert persisted, stating, \"The title of one of your books, Audacity of Hope [Crown, 2006], you acknowledge you got from a sermon from Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the head of the Trinity United Church. He said that Louis Farrakhan 'epitomizes greatness,' \" before asking Obama, \"What do you do to assure Jewish Americans that, whether it's Farrakhan's support or the activities of Reverend Jeremiah Wright, your pastor, you are consistent with issues regarding Israel and not in any way suggesting that Farrakhan epitomizes greatness?\" Trumpet Newsmagazine, a publication founded by Chicago's Trinity United Church of Christ, where Obama is a parishioner and Wright was a minister, awarded Farrakhan the \"Lifetime Achievement 'Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr. Trumpeter Award' \" in 2007. Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen reported that Trumpet said Farrakhan \"truly epitomized greatness.",

   "LA Times editorial\n \n \"Over the years, Palin has actively courted the Alaska Independence Party, or AIP, an organization that supports Alaskan secession from the U.S. To be clear, we're not necessarily talking about friendly secession either: As the AIP's founder, Joe Vogler, told an interviewer in 1991: \"The fires of hell are frozen glaciers compared to my hatred for the American government. ... And I won't be buried under their damn flag.\" \"\n \n \"The McCain campaign denies that Palin ever joined the AIP. But while it is in dispute whether she attended its 1994 convention, she did visit the 2000 one and addressed AIP conventions in 2006 and 2008. Her husband, Todd, was a registered AIP member from 1995 to 2002, and the AIP leadership certainly considers her one of their own.\n \n Video footage shows AIP Vice Chairman Dexter Clark describing Palin at the 2007 North American Secessionist Convention as an \"AIP member before she got the job as a mayor of a small town -- that was a nonpartisan job. But you get along to go along. She eventually joined the Republican Party, where she had all kinds of problems with their ethics, and well, I won't go into that.\" (No need to. The Alaska Legislature's ethics investigators are on the case.) Apparently with Palin in mind, Clark then went on to urge AIP members to \"infiltrate\" the major parties.\n \n So what does Palin currently think of the AIP? Hard to know -- she's been keeping mum -- but this year she told AIP members: \"I'm delighted to welcome you to the 2008 Alaska Independence Party Convention. ... Keep up the good work!\"\"\n\n \n You only have to read the first sentence (which you omitted), and it becomes obvious that the LA times has its own agenda.

That site is so hate filled it's incoherent, and the quotes on there are so taken out of context (if they're provided at all), that you can't even tell what they're discussing.\n \n \nAnd as to the bolded, regarding your blatant lie that Palin said \"So Sambo beat the bitch\", please support that claim with direct evidence as I did with the video clip in my link above.\n\n I already said this hasn't been substantiated to my liking, but OK.\n Link Archie requested\n \n \n \n \nFirst off, can you quote where I said Wrights affair reflected badly on Obama at all?\n\n Wait, you're unwilling to accept the idea that \"lipstick on a pig\" did not specifically refer to Palin, but I'm supposed to buy the idea that you posted this with no intention of having it speak to Obama's character? Yeah, sure Archie\n \n \nI posted that diddy as the newest dirt on Wright as an alleged christian. It surely reflects on his moral compass as a spiritual leader.\n\n As do your actions towards others on your status as an alleged Christian.\n \n \nIt just proves what many of us have been saying all along, that Obama hasn't spent 20 years in a spiritually based church which focussed on doing the work of Christ, but worked out of a social activism community that had a religious label on it for the purpose of tax shelter.\n\n Oh, look at that! It only took you two sentences to get caught in your lie! First sentence-claim that you did not post this as a slur against Obama\n Third sentence-claim this proves Obama is a no good so and so.\n \n \n \nAnd can you post where McCain is accused of having an affair? Are you saying he has cheated on Cindy? I'd like to see that and yes, I would hold it against him in a big way.\n\n Wow, head in the sand much?
