It's the one thing you can ACTUALLY CHANGE on a federal level. Once you get the federal government back to it's few primary responsibilities you can debate abortion all day long at your local level and I suspect people would be a lot happier with the results.

The list of possible interstate economic interactions is not small! (And of course, the part I omitted was the regulation of foreign commerce, which has also grown vastly.)\nFirst off, how is this a problem? The meaning of the interstate commerce clause is known, just act accordingly. If pollution in one state is causing crops not to grow in another than that is a dispute between states which is within the scope of federal power. Second, the Framers did anticipate unforeseen circumstances which is why they created the power to amend the constitution. You know, while society had gotten bigger the main ideas in the constitution have remained the same. We still have states, other nations, a need for defense, and an economy. The constitution doesn't limit based upon complexity.\n \n \nDon't get me wrong: I'm certainly not arguing for an unlimited government, not by any stretch. It just seems to me that the economy is far more complex and far less localized than it was when the Constitution was drafted\nGays, abortion, gun laws, and religion were around when the constitution was written. These social issues are better left up to the states and local governments. As for the economy, it seems a more complex economy is more the reason to keep it at the local level. What does the federal government know about the economic conditions in rural Ohio vs Houston, Tx? I suspect the people that live there know and can adjust on their own terms better than blanket laws for all. The more things change the more they stay the same.\n \n \nand so Congress needfully has a larger regulatory hand in the economy than the Framers envisioned\nCertainly more than they envisioned. How's it working out by the way? Trillions in the hole and still not pulling out of a recession like many other countries are. We are also extremely divisive and the trust in our government is at an all time low and dropping.\n \n \nfor the Framers' real genius, in my view, was in crafting a document flexible enough to adapt to changing historical circumstances.\nFlexibility comes from many people controlling few things. Flexibility is Texas making laws to promote oil drilling while Michigan makes laws to promote car manufacturing. Flexibility is not the federal government picking one over the other for everyone. The flexibility the Framer's had was from decentralization of many things with only the things required to keep a country together being centralized (aka Federalism). The constitution is also flexible in that you can amend it. Beyond that the meaning is what it is because that is the law that was approved. No one signs a contract and then 5 years down the road one party gets to change the terms without the consent of the other. \n \n \nWhich is to say, that that the federal government's \"primary responsibilities\" encompass a lot.\nIt encompasses what it did when it was written. Look at the actual powers given to Congress; we still collect taxes and collect duties, we still have a need to regulate commerce with other nations and within the states, we still coin a uniform money, we still have a postal service, we still have the need for war, we still have the need for a military, we still have the need for patents, etc, etc. The complexity of those tasks makes no difference in whether or not you regulate them. However, the federal government also regulates education, transportation, communications, health care, welfare, farming, and social issues like abortion, marriage, segregation, etc. Which of those did not exist at the time our constitution was written?",
