They may not \"need\" teeth that big, I couldn't say. Just because a creature has a feature doesn't mean its necessary or useful. While evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits, that doesn't mean that a trait won't develop that is simply odd. As long as it isn't particularly negative there's no reason to assume it will go away, and so sometimes you get traits that aren't \"useful\", they're simply not harmful. Those teeth could be such a case.",

   "Some of the angler fish use their tongues as lures, so their mouths are very large, and act as spring traps, with very long but fragile teeth that act as the bars of the cage. They don't pierce the prey so much as trap it in the mouth.\n \n The highly bizarre versions that were illustrated in your links (wow, those were lovely photos) are best thought of as coming from a non-bottom-living version of the monkfish ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Monkfish.jpg ). If you look at the monkfish (Lophius) (and ignore the flattened body associated with living on the sea floor) you can see a more normal looking mouth and teeth on a not-quite-so-wierd body with only semi-wierd dorsal fins, and without the whole parasitic male lifestyle. \n \n More than one could ever want to know about hypotheses on the evolution of most of the angler fish can be found starting with the second cladogram low on the page at http://tolweb.org/Lophiiformes/21989 , and then follow the various links to separate pages on the diverse subgroups and genera. Click on the Ceratioidei in the first (small) cladogram to get to information on the Linophrynidae, which was the group that your links mostly illustrated ( http://tolweb.org/Ceratioidei/22000 ).\n \n Anglerfish are pretty rare as fossils (one discovery is mentioned at http://dearkitty.blogsome.com/2007/04/07/ ).",
