Bacterial resistance has been the foundation for their \"science\" for many years.

Life simply cannot be broken down into tiny segments because the genome is a single, complex, dynamic unit that works as a single entity....not as an accumulation of independent, randomly-acting parts.\n \n Heredity then, despite what Darwinists say, has not so much to do with certain genes, but about how the whole organism interacts with the context of its environment. Its parts are highly responsive and adaptive -- and these adaptations are appropriated by the maintenance of the whole.

Under certain conditions bacteria might copy and pass specific genes on to other bacteria which incorporate them into their genetic makeup, a process known as conjugation or horizontal gene transfer.\n \n \n Biologists, despite the evidence, have refused to acknowledge that we are all wholes - they see us only as an accumulation of parts. They don't see us as intelligent, neither externally or internally - including out genomes. But our genomes are highly intelligent and are highly mutable and quite capable of responding and adjusting to environmental changes.

Rather, resistance resulting from horizontal gene transfer merely provides a mechanism for transferring pre-existing resistance genes. Horizontal transfer does not provide a mechanism for the origin of those genes.\n \n Doubting Darwin\n \n http://www.uq.edu.au/research/index.html?page=5939&pid=5922\n \n Sharing genes likely helps organisms adapt more quickly to new environments\n \n http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-03/uoc--gag030807.php\n \n \n Horizontal gene transfer is an alternative to Darwinian inheritance \n \n Relationship is not just by descent (in a vertical direction) but also horizontally among species that have no common ancestry but just happen to be in the same place at the same time.\n \n http://www.iscid.org/hirsch-acs-talk-2003.php",

Genes in and of themselves do not adapt an organism to the environment. Adaptation is a property of the whole organism.\n \n I believe DNA in itself is not responsible for dictating traits because DNA is under control of the organism.\n\n I don't agree, but that may just be because of miscommunication. Could you come up with a definition for \"control\" that you would be happy to work with?\n \nDNA does not dictate life; life dictates DNA. The organism itself is highly adaptive...and it manipulates its DNA as needed. Base sequences can mutate --- different stretches of DNA can be inserted, deleted or amplified.....genes can be rerranged or recombined or mutated....genes can jump around from one part of the genome to another, etc.\n\n That doesn't necessarily follow. While you appear to understand the various types of mutation, you have not shown that they are evidence of \"manipulation\" by the organism.\n \nThus, the genome is in a constant state of flux....it is changeable at any moment. Genes can even hop around horizontally between species that do not normally breed by way of viruses or parrasites. None of these processes are random or accidental, but are under strict control of the cell and the organism and happen in response to environmental stresses or influences.\n\n Again, that doesn't appear to follow. HGT is an established fact, but you have yet to show that it is nonrandom. Though the mechanisms aren't too well understood yet, scientists are working on it and have not yet decided that there is evidence of direction (though I know how much you trust scientists in cases like this).\n \n I haven't looked into this as much as I would like, but I did come across this site, which explains some of the processes and limits of HGT.\n \nThus, the heredity of traits cannot be reduced to mechanistic causes -- including DNA. And while molecules and their reactions that take place in the genome may be related to inheritance, I disagree with evolutionists in that they themselves are ultimately in charge of or dictate inheritance.\n\n If that's what you're getting at, then maybe we don't disagree as much as I thought. To summarize:\n \n DNA stores information about traits and allows an organism to build proteins, cells, organs, and organ systems. DNA often has more than one set of information for the same structure (alleles). Depending on the conditions an organism experiences, different traits may be expressed (phenotypic plasticity). Also, in certain conditions, specific changes may occur within DNA during the life of the organism (epigenetic inheritance).\n \nAnd we know that traits can by bypass DNA altogether. Epigenetics shows us that. Personally I believe that the organism is the master and the genes our its slaves, not the other way around, as darwinsts say.\n\n In what way would you say that the organism is the master?\n \nCorrect. Please note the key word in that sentence is random.\n\n I'm going to quote Peeling on this one, as he has a pretty good explanation:RM can induce point mutation. Point mutation can disrupt genes or disable upstream promoters, deactivating genes. Deactivation of genes is routinely found to be the deterministic cause of adaptive traits. Therefore, in principle RM can induce adaptive traits.\nSo: is it possible (ignoring probability for now) for a random mutation to have a beneficial effect?\n \nRight on....except for that little word you inserted, \"all.\" There are limits to adaptivity. There are no guarantees in life.\n\n In that case, would the word \"most\" work?\n \nYes, I was just reading today about \"pocket mice\" and how they supposedly exhibit adaptive melanism in order to blend in to their background color. Of course darwinists will attribute this coat color adaptation to selection, but it may just be a simple case of phenotypic plasticity or developmental plasticity. I believe if the background sticks around long enough the coat color change would be written into the animals' DNA, and thus be in itself heredible. Of course since science refuses to test this we may never know.\n\n Chances are, it has been tested (though whether science did the testing is irrelevant). I'd look it up, but I don't have the time to sift through the large reports that I've found right now. In the meantime, let's assume that it is heritable via epigenetic inheritance. This can fit with selection, but it is more complicated than most examples.\n \n The idea is that pocket mice may have to change habitats regularly (if not often), and being able to quickly and reliably change colors to match the environment is helpful for survival. Therefore, if a mouse somehow develops a useful system (such as epigenetic inheritance), it or its offspring would be better survivors of their species' movements.\n Of course, that doesn't quite explain how they develop this system. Here's one possibility: it would involve a series of steps, starting with the development of multiple alleles (each coding for a separate color). With these alleles, at least part of the population would be prepared for each background at all times, though the quantity of those of the other colors would decrease in each particular color of background.

   " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life#Definitions\n \n If you believe that that page is irrelevant, you will need to make that statement clearer. \n\n \n They seem to name some processes that are the results of life, but I don't see a good explanation of how life happens.\n \n \n I don't agree, but that may just be because of miscommunication. Could you come up with a definition for \"control\" that you would be happy to work with? \n\n \n \n \"Manipulate.\" Just like I believe the mind -- or something internal -- manipulates the rest of the body. DNA is no different. I don't think DNA has power over the mnd.\n \n \n That doesn't necessarily follow. While you appear to understand the various types of mutation, you have not shown that they are evidence of \"manipulation\" by the organism. \n\n \n How can an internal response to a changing environment be a random process? If the process is not random, then the molecules are being manipulated. You can tell from the quick, decisive outcome in phenotype that internal processes are manipulated. Chance arrangements could never produce fully-functional outcomes the first time every time.\n \n \n \n \n Again, that doesn't appear to follow. HGT is an established fact, but you have yet to show that it is nonrandom. Though the mechanisms aren't too well understood yet, scientists are working on it and have not yet decided that there is evidence of direction (though I know how much you trust scientists in cases like this). \n\n \n I'll let this guy from Brainstorms speak for me here:\n \n http://www.iscid.org/hirsch-acs-talk-2003.php\n \n Evolution in bacteria and archaea is not random, but biased toward deletion of DNA segments. \n \n The first item, deletion bias, explains why microbial genomes are so small, given that bacteria and archaea regularly gain large gene segments through interspecies transfers. Yet the size of microbial genomes is very small, many at 1 megabase or less and few above 7 megabases. A study of all the extant complete gene sequences for bacteria available in 2001 came to the conclusion that rather than proceeding by Darwinian random mutation, evolution of these genomes has a substantial bias toward deletion of currently unused gene segments\n \n But that's not the whole story. The real issue is that these bacteria are adapting without selection. Bacterial resistance used to be the proof for selection. But now, the proof has fizzled. It is obvious to me that life changes at all levels without the need for selection. And the concept that genes can be transferred horizontally is so absolutely anti-darwinian, which calls only for vertical transmission of traits.\n \n \n \n \n \n If that's what you're getting at, then maybe we don't disagree as much as I thought. To summarize:\n \n DNA stores information about traits and allows an organism to build proteins, cells, organs, and organ systems. DNA often has more than one set of information for the same structure (alleles). Depending on the conditions an organism experiences, different traits may be expressed (phenotypic plasticity). Also, in certain conditions, specific changes may occur within DNA during the life of the organism (epigenetic inheritance). \n \n In what way would you say that the organism is the master? \n\n \n It's either one way or the other. If genes manipulate the organism, then science has the power and potential to solve all the world's major problems. The reason is this: if genes determine the characters of organisms, then science would be able to manipulate the appropriate gene(s) to create new characters or traits. If a person is depresed, science could insert a new, non-defected gene to fix the problem. Same with other diseases and traits. This is the basic mindset of today's science, despite the fact that this concept simply doesn't work. But despite not working, the paradigm that gave birth to it lives on. \n \n And so the basic problem is that science simply refuses to acknowledge that genetic stability is not a property of a transferred gene, but of the ecological whole in which the organism exists. They also fail to to acknowledge that genes, and the genome itself, are not static and constant: and that there is no genetic blueprint for making an animal. But in reality, the genome itself is responsive and can change during the course of development, which is based on a relationship between it and the organism's internal and external environments. Thus, an organism is not a victim of its genes to be judged by selection, it's an active participant in life, which creates its own destiny. \n \n Of course, this concept is easily testable. \n \n \n \n I'm going to quote Peeling on this one, as he has a pretty good explanation:So: is it possible (ignoring probability for now) for a random mutation to have a beneficial effect?\n \n RM can induce point mutation. Point mutation can disrupt genes or disable upstream promoters, deactivating genes. Deactivation of genes is routinely found to be the deterministic cause of adaptive traits. Therefore, in principle RM can induce adaptive traits.\n \n \n\n \n Point mutations are copying errors. How would a mutation effect that process? But you're not really a believer that point mutations drive evolution, are you? If so, we've got some ground to cover there. \n \n \n \n \nThe idea is that pocket mice may have to change habitats regularly (if not often), and being able to quickly and reliably change colors to match the environment is helpful for survival. Therefore, if a mouse somehow develops a useful system (such as epigenetic inheritance), it or its offspring would be better survivors of their species' movements.\n Of course, that doesn't quite explain how they develop this system. Here's one possibility: it would involve a series of steps, starting with the development of multiple alleles (each coding for a separate color). With these alleles, at least part of the population would be prepared for each background at all times, though the quantity of those of the other colors would decrease in each particular color of background. In the end, the mice which ended up changing colors at around the right time (by passing on the correct alleles) would end up with more offspring, though these changes would be random until some sort of system developed.\n This system could develop somewhat easily based on this repeated back-and-forth selection. Such selection would essentially force the mice to carry different alleles and would select for mice which developed an order to their color changes, especially if the changes were triggered by different colors of ground (it is worth noting at this point that humans have special receptors for the the color of blue usually found in the sky and that they respond in special ways to that particular color).\n \n I realize that this leaves some gaps, but hopefully you can get a sense that the Theory of Evolution can explain more than mutations and that it doesn't ignore other things that affect the genome.\n \n \n \n Hopefully everything is understandable, because it's getting too late to proofread. \n\n \n I think the \"somehow develops a useful system\" is where I'd get stuck..especially by way of random mutation. ultimately it's about what' believable, and I don't find any evidence that leads me to believe that this is a possibility.",

A definition should allow you to recognize something, but it doesn't need to explain it.

In reality, people have not reached that point and even if we had, it would be insufficient for repairing problems that have already been integrated into the cell structure (of the brain, in the case of depression). DNA was used in the creation of the brain structure, but it does little regarding thought processes after that. Fixing the DNA would not make much of a difference to the brain.\n \nAnd so the basic problem is that science simply refuses to acknowledge that genetic stability is not a property of a transferred gene, but of the ecological whole in which the organism exists. They also fail to to acknowledge that genes, and the genome itself, are not static and constant: and that there is no genetic blueprint for making an animal.\n\n Even though there are many factors involved, there is no logical reason to dismiss DNA as the carrier of information regarding life. You cannot simply throw out 100 years of genetics based on HGT and epigenetic inheritance (which rely on DNA, by the way).\n \nThus, an organism is not a victim of its genes to be judged by selection...\n\n No one said it was. This hasn't been explained well in the past, so I'll try to explain it now.\n \n DNA directs the growth of an organism, but completed structures function separately (to an extent). For example, DNA does not direct the actions an organism takes. The only effect that it has comes from the fact that the DNA was responsible for the setup of the brain, which may have biased the organism towards certain choices (or attitudes such as caution).\n What this means is that DNA has influence over an organism's actions only indirectly, with the organism's brain (or nervous system or organelles, depending on the organism) having direct control.\n \nPoint mutations are copying errors. How would a mutation effect that process?\n\n I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Did you use \"effect\" to mean \"bring about\" or \"affect\"?\n \nBut you're not really a believer that point mutations drive evolution, are you?\n\n Not entirely. Certainly they have an effect on the gene pool, and the mutated organism can be selected for/against (the latter being most likely), but they aren't the only type of mutation, and mutations are not the only things to create variation.\n \n My answer is therefore no- I do not believe that they alone drive evolution, but I do believe that they are a factor.\n \nI think the \"somehow develops a useful system\" is where I'd get stuck..especially by way of random mutation.\n\n Actually, the system of epigenetic inheritance was around before the pocket mice were, which is evident because of the wide variety of organisms it appears in. I'd like someone with more knowledge to clarify, but it would make sense that it could be applied to new traits (otherwise, it would have to arise separately for different traits in different organisms, which doesn't make sense based on our current understanding of biology).\n I'm not sure exactly how this would work, and I'm too tired to look it up right now, so I'll just remind you that the science of epigenetics accepts (and even recognizes) natural selection and random mutations.\n \nultimately it's about what' believable, and I don't find any evidence that leads me to believe that this is a possibility.\n\n This isn't about evidence.

Thus, DNA is not the source for inducing change...\n \n I think, as marvelous and incrdedible as DNA is, it's simply a reflection of \"you\" in microscopic form. It can be molded and shaped an manipulated just like you can. As a whole person, you are subject to change by way of stress, emotions, beliefs, physical sensations, etc...and it's no different in your genome. Your genome can no more benefit from an accidental change than your physical body can. Most changes that are not called on by the whole are almost always unwanted changes. And DNA is no different. As magical and mysterious and miraculous as DNA is, I believe the real miracle of life lies far below DNA, behind the scenes The miracle of life is not something you can see under a microscope....which is why I do not believe DNA is truly in control of anything other than acting as a kind of storage device. And if DNA is mostly just a storage device, and is not even the source of producing new phenotypic traits (remember, new traits get written into DNA after the phenotype changes) how could it as you say, be \"responsible for the setup of the brain?\"",
