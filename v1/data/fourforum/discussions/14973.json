   "Watch: Shreveport Man Brutalized in Anti-Gay Attack with Pool Cue - Towleroad | #gay #news\n \n A Shreveport, Louisiana man is in the hospital following a brutal attack at a nightclub that witnesses say was related to his sexual orientation, KSLA reports:\n \n SkaggsPolice say 52 year old, John Skaggs was hospitalized after he was attacked at the Sandbar nightclub in downtown Shreveport.\n \n \"He's going to have some pretty serious reconstructive surgery, broken jaw, and broken bone that holds his eye socket,\" said the manager and owner of the Sandbar, Tim Huck.\n \n Security personnel at the Sandbar held the alleged attacker, William Payne until police arrived.\n \n Payne was arrested and charged with attempted 2nd degree murder and the commission of a hate crime.\n \n \"It was totally 100 percent a hate crime for this sexual orientation,\" said Huck.\n \n The bar provided police with video surveillance. Huck says it's disturbing, and shows Payne who is a large man, breaking the cue stick over Skaggs' face with one powerful blow.\n \n Huck says the attack was unprovoked: \"At no point in time had he talked to the man that attacked him, bumped him. After watching the video and from witnesses they hadn't even made any form of eye contact or anything.\"",

   "There are some serious problems with this report (both the article and the video).\n \n It's self-contradictory, for one thing. It is made clear that the perpetrator and victim had not spoken to one another, so how is it possible for the attacker to have known the victim was gay to begin with?\n \n It is possible someone could have said 'that guy is gay' or something to that effect, but the article doesn't say, and therefore the second problem here is that there is just too little information here to make a judgment. At this point the facts are that a guy hit another guy with a pool cue stick, and the guy that got hit happens to be gay. That's about there is to go on at this point.\n \n This is a great example of the problem I (and many others) have with the concept of hate crime laws. They are subjective in that they attempt to make a crime out of prejudice, which is not an objective and provable concept. Law should be based on objectivism, not criminalizing something subjective. That people in this article are jumping to conclusions based on circumstantial evidence is exactly the sort of thing that is frightening about hate crime legislation.",

   "News reports don't determine if something is a hate crime, the criminal justice system does. You absolutely can't willy, nilly call something a hate crime just because its victim is a member of a certain group, they do have to prove the motive. Motive for a crime is ALWAYS relevant in a court a law, this is just another faucet of that. Hate crimes carry a stiffer penalty because they are an act of terrorism. Its not the same thing to beat up Bob for being being a dick or because you are drunk as beating up Bob for being gay, black, Jewish etc. The latter is sending a specific message used to terrorize an entire group/community.",

   "It's awful that something like this happens, and the guy needs to spend some time behind bars. \n \n That said, I don't really agree with the concept of hate crime legislation. I think punishment should be about the crime itself rather than the intentions. Instead of bridging the divide between people, I feel like hate crimes legislation (and things like affirmative action) are spreading the divide further. Hitting someone in the face with a pool cue is wrong no matter if the guy is gay or if the guy didn't call your sister back, or whatever. \n \n A white guy could hit a black guy for completely different reasons, but since the guys look different, now its a serious criminal offense. I don't know, penalty enhancement for hate crimes just doesn't seem right to me.",

He ran at the man at a full sprint and hit him across the face with the thick end of a cue breaking it into pieces, he was trying to kill the man, thats why its attempted murder, so next time you read it was a attempted murder and hate crime, just accept that maybe it actually was, thats why they said it.",
