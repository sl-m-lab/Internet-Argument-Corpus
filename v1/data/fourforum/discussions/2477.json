   "I have a question. Why do people need to pray in school? It's obvious that if we are trying to put aside time for prayer alone, it is a \"need\" and not a want for those who are fighting for it. Does prayer need to be lead? I'm assuming that a student praying can ask/thank their higher power or deity without the help of a teacher or minister. Does this need to spend class time? Most of the students that I know pray silently on their own accord w/o instruction, but not when classwork needs to be done or a lecture needs to be paid attention to. This is why those \"crazy liberal judges\" made the laws so that a prayer that is initiated by a student and is not disturbing to the class is allowed to continue (aka individual silent prayer). Have you considered also that there is no such thing as a non-denominational prayer? If this kind of prayer is required, there will always be someone who is left out.\n \n Forget about athiests for a second and think about Diests. They believe that God left a clockwork universe running and He doesn't interfere in its workings, so prayer is useless to them (and they believe in God - gasp!). \n \n In a nutshell, school is for learning, so alloting time for something non-school related during time which could be used for learning is disruptive. A student can pray to themselves as long as they dont disrupt class as is with any type of action from a student (a student can't practice for his/her tap recital during class if it involves dancing on desks or otherwise distracting students from learning).",

But, there are schools that will not allow it. Government mandates forcing the whole school to stop what they are doing, stand up and pray out loud to some god or God is not freedom, but on the other hand taking away the privilege to pray altogether is illegal. Forcing Mohammad, for example, to attend prayer in the name of Jesus is wrong, but don&#8217;t condemn Christians for wanting to meet around the flagpole at break.
