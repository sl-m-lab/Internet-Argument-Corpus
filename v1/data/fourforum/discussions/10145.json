   "My wife and I watch it faithfully, and there are VERY few shows that I make a point of watching. We've seen all of Seasons 1 and 2 twice now. It really is an excellent program. \n \n Any word on season 3? I notice Kevin McKidd (Lucius Vorenus) has his own show premiering on NBC in the fall. I'm not sure how he could film both shows at once, and Rome wouldn't be the same without him. He and Titus Pullo make the show for me.\n \n I can't imagine what the show costs to produce per episode with all the sets, cameras, and wardrobe, but the visual presentation of the show is incredible. It brings ancient Rome to life. I imagine the price tag is one of the main reasons there aren't more shows like it.\n \n Waxy",

It's a Canadian comedy, more than a little quirky, and takes a bit of patience to start with, but the show is abolutely hilarious. It started out as a cult favourite up here on Showcase and became a huge hit, there was even a movie released.\n \n Profanity is over the top, but it's not \"mean spirited\", in fact the profanity itself is often the gag.\n \n HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n \n Waxy",
