   " next time get the quotes first-hand please \n\n \n First hand? Jesus isn't responding to my requests for clarification... :) \n \n \n\n the advice is more accurately \"worry not about what will happen tomorrow, because tomorrow will take care of itself\". \n\n \n We are in agreement on what the advice is, regardless of the precise wording of any one translation, which is found in Luke 12:27-29. My point is that tomorrow doesn't take care of itself, and the advice is bad. I don't know who will feed my family tomorrow if I don't work today, and I shouldn't expect others to assume that burden. Lilies in the field may not worry about their retirement, but I do and therefore make plans accordingly. A farmer considering a fall harvest is in violation of Jesus' teaching, is he not? This may have worked for Jesus, who, according to the gospels, ate and slept on other people's dimes. I don't have that luxury. \n \n \n\n the statement \"he who is without sin cast the first stone\" was a demonstration that none of us are without sin, and therefore none of us can judge the other \n\n \n Again we agree on the meaning, but I say again it's bad advice. The BTK killer will be glad to hear you refuse to judge him because you've had an impure thought about some babe you saw. What nonsense is that? Our entire judicial system would grind to a halt with that advice. \n \n \n\"resist not evil\"? where dis jesus evil say that?\n\n \n He said it in his Sermon on the Mount (Mt 5:39). Unthinkable and irresponsible! Stop evil where you find it and use force if necessary. Then he further teaches to offer the left cheek after being stricken on the right. Foolishness! Teach the universally accepted right to self-defense I say. Luckily Christians simply smile at these and many more teachings of Jesus and go about the business of following more sensible laws, regulations, and practical advice.",
