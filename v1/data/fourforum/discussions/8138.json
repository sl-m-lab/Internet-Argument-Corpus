   "People are up in arms in my Southwestern Ohio area about the impact of \"The DaVinci Code\". \n \n Excerpt from the Cincinnati Enquirer:\n \n \n \n\"The story we tell is loaded with all sorts of hooey and fun kind of scavenger-hunt-type nonsense.\" - Tom Hanks, star, \"The Da Vinci Code.\"\n \n \n \"We're not frightened this is going to be so disruptive of people's lives they're going to abandon their faith.\" - Duane Davis, a community pastor at Vineyard Community Church.\n \n \"For people whose faith is already weakened, and this comes along -- the devil just sits back and smiles.\" - Bob George, Kenwood, anti-\"Da Vinci Code\" prayer vigil volunteer.\n \n \n In 2,000 years, Christianity has survived many tests.\n \n The latest, it seems, opens in theaters today.\n \n The screen version of Dan Brown's multimillion-selling book \"The Da Vinci Code\" has only fueled debate over its elaborate, even lurid, version of religious history.\n \n In a letter that was distributed locally through fliers, e-mail, bulletin boards and churches, prayer-vigil organizers Bob George and Patrick Ashcraft linked the movie to \"the raging cultural war that is devastating the soul of America.\"\n \n \"Dan Brown ... like Osama bin Laden, has perhaps done more than anyone else to bring this cultural battleground to our own back yards,\" they wrote.\n \n ...\n \n Among other responses:\n \n Today's edition of the Catholic Telegraph weekly newspaper will carry a special four-page insert, prepared by the national publication Our Sunday Visitor, that takes on factual assertions. \"The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has been preparing for this for some time,\" said Dan Andriacco, director of communications for the Archdiocese of Cincinnati.\n \n \"Prayerful protests\" will greet moviegoers at several local theaters today, including Showcase Cinemas Springdale, Kenwood and Western Hills, as well as Northgate Cinemas and Rave Cinemas in West Chester.\n \n Latonia Baptist Church, Covington, will conduct a seminar at 7 p.m. Sunday based on material Pastor Stephen E. Hollaway compiled to counter \"Da Vinci Code\" lore.\n \n Vineyard will train volunteers (at 7 p.m. May 25 in the church's gym) to lead small home meetings. \"We want to give people a platform to talk about the facts behind the fictitious story,\" Davis said.\n \n While many Catholic leaders have advised the faithful to stay away from the movie, Barbara Nicolosi, founder of the nonprofit company Act One, that trains Christians to create positive entertainment, is urging an \"othercott\" this weekend. Through her blog, churchofthemasses.blogspot.com, she encourages movie fans to go see any other film besides \"Da Vinci\" and thus dilute its box-office take.\n\n \n [more]\n \n What do you think about it?",

I have no intention of seeing the film unless I'm strapped to a clockwork orange-style device, having read the book and having found no merit in it whatsoever. \n \n I've already made my views on this book clear on another thread, but just for the record, I'll say it again: what a pointless, boring, predictable, over-hyped, underwhelming piece of pretentious, pseudo-intellectual trash this book (and now film) really is.\n \n It only annoys me because the book recieved so much attention and publicity when in reality it is an absolute thriller-by-numbers with enough controversial material to guarantee media attention and high sales. \n \n Any idiot who took a creative writing course and did some research into Christianity and the more outlandish conspiracy theories associated with the religion could have written this book. It has absolutely nothing interesting to say, and nothing challenging to think about. \n \n It is the very definition of an \"airport novel\" apart from the fact that it would only make your wait in the departure hall even more annoying once you realised you had forked out \u00a36.99 or whatever for a story that couldn't physically be more formulaic and less absorbing.",

I saw the movie yesterday and have to say it wasn't nearly as good as the book (actually this is the case for most books made into movies), but it was decent.\n \n Now my question is, how were all the Christians so for the free speech of the press with the political cartoon of the Muslim with a bomb in Europe, yet so against a movie that simply presents an alternative version of \"facts\" in a movie setting. I would think a political cartoon would be more insulting because, well it's supposed to be political. This is just a movie, and if you don't want to see it, then don't. It really ain't that hard.",

   "Well, exactly!\n \n While plenty of christians have (I assume) ignored the movie and the \"challenge\" it represents to christianity there has been plenty of hype in the media about the stand-off between church and film in this case.\n \n 1) I have not seen any stories that actually back up the idea that the church ( or any subdivision of it) seems bothered by the film (although I have been deliberately avoiding any story that seems to involve this film)\n \n 2) The film has no agenda, as opposed to the cartoons pointed out by zachvac which, harmless as they may be in principle, being only ink and paper, have a socio-political point to make.\n \n Have I missed some serious controversy? I really am not aware of any respected arm of christianity having a problem with this film, mainly because I have dismissed any such stories as BS before I've read them (which I didn't even bother to do!)\n \n However, with the prevalence of films in today's supposedly morally influential mass culture I can imagine some over-zealous (and yet strangely insecure) christians being worried by the negative connotations that the Code might bring to christianity. If you have less faith in people than your eligious texts then a film like this may worry you, but this is a systemic problem in modern religion, which I believe has led to the 'fundamentalist' revival in both the christian and muslim spheres; it's a literal return to the middle ages where Man is worthless and the Book and High Priests are everything.",
