   "I have enclosed the link on the study done in RI (yes, I know the smallest state in the union). But the findings are interesting and may reflect on the national fight for rights. Here is the link and some highlights of the study:\n \n Additionally, the data from the scan reveals the following: \n \n \u0095 The LGBTQ community is not homogeneous. Sexual orientation and gender identity are just two elements of an individual's experience. Individuals identifying as LGBTQ are of every race, ethnicity, econ- omic background and religious denomination. Those who come from communities of color or other minority groups experience multiple oppressions. \n \n \u0095 LGBTQ communities look much like the rest of the state. Individuals within these communities are long-term residents; active participants in the labor force; geographically distributed; diverse in age, gender and ethnic and racial background; serve in the military; and often self- identify as parents and partners. \n \n \u0095 LGBTQ communities experience discrimination and prejudice in public and private settings. Participants indicated experiencing or witnessing homophobia in all aspects of their lives - in public establishments and on the street. \n \n \u0095 Ensuring safe schools for youth is a high priority for LGBTQ commu- nities. When asked to rank their top service-related priorities, ensuring safe schools for LGBTQ youth consistently ranked as number one, regardless of respondents' race, age, gender or sexual orientation. \n \n \u0095 LGBTQ-focused organizations are typically newer, rely heavily on unpaid staff and have budgets under $50,000. These organizations struggle to operate and have more difficulty responding to the increased demands and needs of a growing and diverse community.3A full-length portrait of Rhode Island's LGBTQ individuals \u00b7 Summary\n \n \n Source: http://www.rifoundation.org/equity_action/equity_pdfs/Meet_the_Neighbors.pdf",
