   "http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2004/02/03/kerry_heinz/index_np.html\n \n Is America ready for the wild Kerry family?\n Dad may come off like a stiff, but Mom and the kids are a whole other story.\n \n - - - - - - - - - - - -\n By Rebecca Traister\n \n \n \n Feb. 3, 2004 | Take my wife ... please. \n \n It has been the recent borscht-belt refrain on the campaign trail, as Democratic front-runners Howard Dean and John Kerry have unexpectedly put their controversial spouses front and center. For Dean, the need to showcase his reclusive partner, Dr. Judy Steinberg Dean, was a matter of tempering what had turned into his major stumbling block -- a reputation for fiery unorthodoxy. After yelling through his loss in Iowa, and with voters clearly under the impression that his stay-at-home doctor wife was some sort of militant careerist trying to torpedo his Big Fat Presidential Bid, the Deans did a round of press in which they demonstrated just how peaceful and normal they were: ranch house, rhododendrons, shag carpet... \"We are the most boring people on earth!\" they shouted -- quietly -- at anyone who would listen. \n \n But on the other side of the polling numbers was John Kerry, the lantern-jawed New Englander whose expressions of enthusiasm make Al Gore look like Animal from the Muppets. Kerry too, brought his family out in late January, but their aesthetic purpose seems to be the exact opposite of the Rockwellian stability that Dean -- and many past presidential hopefuls before him -- have been forced to parade in front of Diane Sawyer and her ilk. The Heinz-Kerrys are nuts! A roiling mass of beauty, brains and bad temper, the Kerry brood is the stuff that America's infatuation with nighttime drama is made of.",

   "Negative cubed. I simply posted a link to an article I found interesting. Why don't you do that instead of lurking in the background waiting on an opportunity to come out with a catty remark?\n\n \n Why? \n \n Because I am so bored with side show debates about Vietnam, Kerry's family/money, etc... \n \n Any time actual issues are brought up, or facts are laid out, the thread either never gets off the ground or comes to a screeching halt. I could cite several threads that prove this point. The biggest one to my mind is the debate regarding Kerry's voting record. It was plainly set forward in an unbiased manner. It didn't change a thing and the thread died.\n \n I've tried a couple times to steer the debates toward healthcare, taxation, economy, etc... all were dismal failures. On top of that, for every attempt made to start a thread on the issues, 10 more threads pop up about Vietnam or flip-flops, or just plain personal attacks on Kerry/Bush. \n \n When someone starts posting threads that would be better suited to the front page of the National Enquirer, I think they should be called on it. \n \n Waxy",
