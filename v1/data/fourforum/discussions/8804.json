   "Evolutionists' Worst Nightmare\n \n If you've ever read a long post in your life - make it this one, brother. I guarantee I won't disappoint. The further you get down, the harrier this thing is going to get. I will hold back nothing.\n \n \n This post, though it's a bit long, will be some of the most delicious, highly satisfying entertainment you've tasted in a long time. And along with being entertaining, I'm going to expose/uncover what I've been suspecting for a long time: That the theory of evolution is founded on nothing but a flimsy platform of hate and savage racism. \n \n Please note beforehand - I am not calling anyone on this board or any other specific evolutionist a racist. I'm merely stating a premise - that this thoery is based on nothing but the philosophy of racism. This will become very apparent towards the end of the post. (I did not make this theory up - I'm merely reporting the details.)\n \n In this post I am also going to destroy Toe by showing that the Neandertals did not evolve their physical characteristics through random mutations and natural selection. Instead, they developed them God's way - the intelligent way. I'm going to weave all these things together to create a filthy collage that depicts what the theory of evolution really stands for. This post will tie everything together and will make more logical sense than any conveluted-writing Darwinist author (Dawkins, Mayr, Eldredge and Darwin himself) could ever dream of presenting. Not everyone is willing to say these things. But I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I have an inner desire to uncover and expose the raw truth - of which evolutionists hate. \n \n First of all it's interesting that Liberals in this country point the finger at Conservatives for being racists when their whole ideological makeup is based on racism. When Darwin first dreamed up his monkey theory, he felt that evolution was able to preserve the \"more fit species.\" Interestingly, he indeed refered to different races as \"species.\"...and this is because evolutionists are fond of placing people in groups. They love to separate by ethnic, cultural and religious basis...(They can't help themselves.) Of course now they shroud this under the guize of \"diversity\" -- which is to get around this obvious obsession to label people. They do this to trick the masses and divert attention of who they really are - meanwhile pointing the finger at others. At the heart of this diversity madness, though, is the evil concept of different groups of people being \"more fit\" than other groups. This is the real origin of racism.\n \n Of course at the top of the pyramid sits the \"most fit\" - the evolutionist atheists, who peer over society. Everyone else (according to them) sits somewhere below them. There is an intellectual superiority that reigns among these people. It is so obvious on this board who the \"superiors\" think they are. They sneer down at anyone like me who doesn't agree with them. Instead of debating the facts, evolutionists will often resort to attacking the intelligence (or lack of it) in their opponent. With the wave of their superior wand they think they're able to make the whole argument go away by simply discrediting their advisary's credentials. They do this with George Bush, they did it with Reagan, they do it with pastors, preachers, and Christians everywhere. It's a world-wide hate phenomenon that extends to everyone who doesn't hate what they hate. And this comes from the underlying belief that two entities cannot coexist at the same time without one or the other being \"selected out.\" Life and nature is nothing but a barbaric competition to them, where the \"weak\" get killed off and/or replaced.\n \n Of course, as I see it, evolutionists are doing a geat job of hiding their inner racism towards modern-day groups. But there's a very clever diversion going on here. Instead of being outspoken and audibly racist against anyone who could potentially vote against them, they're outspoken and racists towards the helpless and inconsequential. The first group is unborn children - of whom they have no problem murdering. The second group is our dead ancestors - who they have no problem besmearing: Homo erectus and the Neandertals - who are both fully human. They have successfully convinced the public through a series of lies that because these groups of individuals look different, that they are somehow \"less human\" -- therefore not deserving of full human status. Just because they may have had large, dense features (big, bulky bones, large heads) evolutionists have surmised that their brains are \"less sophisticated\", \"less fit\" and \"less-wired\" than modern brains. Can you imagine if these intellectual superiors were to aim this predjudice towards groups living today? Of course, they can't do it, so they're forced to put these disgusting skeletons in the closet so they won't be outed as hypocrites.\n \n But let's look at Neandertals and Homo erectus under the light of reality. Regardless of the fact that homo sapiens, lived alongside both these groups, Evolutionists claim, of course that their traits indicated that they were somehow \"subhuman.\"\n \n And see here's one of the items in the evolutionists' bag of tricks: They love to emphasize the postive characteristics of apes, yet at the same time ridicule and downplay the Neandertal and Homo erectus. They play this mind game so they can sub-consciously level the mental playing field and soften people up to the notion that humans and apes are actually closer than they are. It's nothing but a racist snowjob of picking and choosing who they build up or tear down - based on their political agenda. Unlike evolutionists, though, God is not a racist.\n \n Physical Traits of Neandertals and Homo Erectus:\n \n We've already learned the power of plasticity and adaptivity. It can shape and mold an organism from the moment of conception. Also traits are able to be formed during development that will aid in the functionality of life on the outside. I've given numerous examples of plasticity....one is that tadpoles can develop into a large-headed or small-headed morph depending on diet early on in life. Snakes do the same thing.\n \n My hypothesis, of course, is that Neandertals and Homo erectus are no different. First, it is known that these individuals had very similar physical features...in fact, other than brain size they were almost identical. This might be why the early African Homo sapien fossils have been referred to as \"African Neandertals\"....while many of the Asian homo erectus fossils have been called \"Asian Neandertals.\" And in many cases it's difficult to tell the difference between Neandertals and Erectus fossils.\n \n But both groups were no-doubt hunters. Thus, their bodies were shaped for the purpose of living in a harsh environment and for fighting and overpowering their dinner. This required strong bones and a solid body mass. Interestingly the area of the brain that determines these motor functions is - you guessed it -- in the frontal lobe.... the cerebellum. This area was probably enlarged as a result of necessity to cope with their current situation. It has nothing to with being \"subhuman\"...as the rasicsts imply. It has nothing to do with being blood-thirsty savages who carried their wives by their hair either. If anything, it proves the inner intelligence, majesty, and design of the human body.\n \n In addition, these people no doubt used their teeth as tools of sorts - as cutting and clamping devices...thus their teeth and jaw structures were merely transformed by their dietary habits. It would be no different than when I was 8 years old and learned how to play the guitar: God made my fingers adaptive and soon they developed callouses, which allowed me to play without drawing blood - these callouses still remain today.\n \n In addition, we've learned that Neandertals most certainly had rickets. This was a consquence of a Vitamin D definciency. Of course, we have learned that Vitamin D deficiency often results from having dark skin and being placed into a situation where there is less sunlight. My hypothesis is that Neandertals are the same people as the Homo erectus (both of which, no doubt, had dark skin)....and then Neandertals merely migrated northward - which, because of their extended distance from the equator and the occurrence of the Ice Age, resulted in a cooler, less-sunny climate than their dark skin was adapted for in Africa. In addition, these people most certainly consumed much meat, which possibly supplemented the body with an overload of Vitamin A. Vitamin A overload has been shown to interfere with Vitamin D production. Thus: a Vitamin D deficiency soon resulted among Neandertal individuals, which ultimately altered their bone structures: \n \n Vitamin-D deficiency rickets, a disorder that becomes apparent during infancy or childhood, is the result of insufficient amounts of vitamin D in the body. The vitamin deficiency may be caused by poor nutrition, a lack of exposure to the sun, or malabsorption syndromes in which the intestines do not adequately absorb nutrients from foods. Vitamin D is needed for the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus in the body, which, in turn affects how calcium is deposited in the bones; thus it is considered essential for proper bone development and growth. Major symptoms of vitamin D deficiency rickets include bone disease, restlessness, and slow growth. This disorder is rare in the United States but is not uncommon in certain areas of the world.\n \n (Interestingly it's been shown that almost every Neandertal child studied had rickets)\n \n http://www.webmd.com/hw/diet_and_nutrition/nord883.asp\n \n My assertion, thus, is that Neandertals -- who were essentially the same individuals as Homo erectus - at some point migrated out of Africa, took up residence in Europe, and developed rickets as result of climate change. Over the generations, through isolation and possibly some nonrandom genetic mutations cued by the environment, Neandertals became their own \"race\" of people. And that's all they were: People....and this is proven by the fact that their bones were found in the same cave in Germany as \"modern human\" bones - both of which, date at 40-44,000 years ago. (evolutionists' time clock). And it's also proven by their large array of artifacts.\n \n And here's something important. What you have to remember is that Neandertals and Homo Erectus, lived in the same general geological environment as apes. Thus, since it is a biological fact that humans share many similar physical characteristics with apes, it's logical to assume that the same environmental cues could have elicited the same types of physiological changes in both organisms. This hypothesis is backed up by Peter Borger, who is insistent that nonrandom mutations account for genetic similarities between primates and humans.\n \n http://www.iscid.org/papers/Borger_S...ons_061506.pdf\n \n Evolutionarily speaking, it has been shown that Homo erectus fossils overlaps the entire Homo habilis (monkey) population. The oldest Homo erectus fossil is dated at just under 2 million years old....the oldest Homo habilis fossil (primate) is dated at just over 2 million years old. The fossil record also shows that homo erectus and homo habilis lived side-by-side for a half a million years (evolutinists time clock). Therefore common sense says that homo erectus (human) could never have evolved from homo habilis (monkey). Not only that, but the fossil record shows that homo erectus lived alongside homo sapiens for 2 million years. Thus, there is no possible way that there was any evolution via random mutations and natural selection could have occurred.\n \n Back to racism\n \n It seems that the evolutionists have been hiding a dirty secret. \n \n It's a politically corect little game they've been playing with their \"science.\" What's the game? -- Well see, in their minds, they have to figure out a way to maintain their \"out of Africa\" scenerio - which conceals their obvious racism. In fact, I believe the whole dad-gum evolutionary platform is built on this flimsy politcally correct agenda that does little more than hide their blatant racism. How? Why? Hang with me, man....hold my hand -- I'll guide you right through this twisted madness....It's really very simple. \n \n Get a load of this......\n \n Common sense says that if Homo erectus (fully human) is indeed our ancestor, and if we all evolved from this homo erectus \"pool of genes\", modern humans would have all evolved from wherever Homo erectus resided..... \n \n This makes total sense from a scientific and common sense perspective considering that Homo erectus was the first real so-called \"human-like\" link between monkeys and humans. But here's the problem. Homo erectus fossils' dates are scattered all over the place. For example, in Asia, Homo erectus bones (Java man, Peking man) are dated at 400,000 years. European Homo erectus fossils are dated from 500,000 years. Rhodesian Man, on the otherhand - which evolved out of Africa - are dated at 40,000 years. Oooops\n \n Thus the obvious conclusion from this scenario is that Africans (Blacks), due to the fact that they started evolving later than Europeans and Asians, are almost 400,000 years behind these other groups in evolutionary standards. Thus, they got a late start! This realization might explain the intellectual superiority of Darwinists of the past - and why they have a history of referring to black people as \"savages.\" But obviously, present day Darwinists live in their fairytale land of Political Correctness and they now feel the need to hide this little problem. And thus, they've hidden it by steering people around the scenerio that all humans evolved from Homo erectus! This is the dirty little, disgusting secret you'll never hear on CNN. And the truth is that evolutionists have made up a big, fat whopper to save face to the black community - of whom they require votes. And this is regardless of what the evidence shows.\n \n This is why the politically correct Atheist Liberals in this country have developed a new plan of evolution -- it's the \"Out of Africa\" plan - including the so-called African \"Eve.\" It's political spin designed to steer people away from the darwinist version of scientific evidence that would point to black people as being inferior and more like primates. And the funny thing is, like I said, it goes against all evidence. Not to mention it's quite a contrast from the Christian perspective - that all humans are made in God's image.\n \n And this is why virtually all the media attention is on LUCY and other discoveries that point to the 7 million-years-ago time-frame. It's a diversion so brilliantly evil that only the Devil could concoct it...(ie the scientific community and the media) This diversion, therefore shifts our attention from Homo erectus and Neanderals -- to Lucy. It's a brilliant sleight-of-hand move that removes the \"hero\" status from our real ancestors --Homo Erectus and Neandertal - and gives it to Lucy - a filthy, stinking, stupid, bug-picking 7 million year-old tree-swinging, leaf-eating, knuckle-dragging PRIMATE (short-bodied -- long, curved fingers and toes, small torso, etc). And it accomplishes even more than that:\n \n In addition, this scheme was dreamed up to appeal to Christians, who have a pre-conceived religious notion that the original human was created in that part of the world. It also appeals to black people, who feel they've been discriminated against and labled as \"unequal\" because of their physical characteristics. And it does this because evolutionists have told people that everyone is now supposedly the ancestor of this one historical \"Eve.\" This is a brilliant move, because now -- suddenly -- everyone can relax and put a smile on their faces because - like in the Bible -- we've all descended from the same source and on the same time-scale...ie...racial equality. This not only takes the burden off the scientific community's precious theory of evolution, but it accomplishes everything that needs to be accomplished - regardless of the truth or evidence. \n \n But the mental war has been won. Lucy is now the hero - which everyone, evidently, is ok with. I mean the evolutionists have succeeded in convincing a large portion of the public that it's better to be related to Lucy than it is to be related to Neandertals --- because who in their right minds wants to be known as a descendant to a bunch of disgusting Brutes? No one! (This is despite the fact that these \"Brutes\" were shown to bury their dead and make/use an assortment of tools, fire, etc) Thus, evolutionists, in all their atheist, racist glory, have relentlessly ridiculed and downgraded our true human ancestors over the decades.....and just like our unborn babies -- they've systematically killed them all off. \n \n And this whole thing is so outrageous because it's the Darwinists who proclaim that all life evolved through the mechanism of an unholy XXXX-shoot. Yes, the Big bang rolled the evolutionary dice and we just happened to be the lucky mutations who self-assembled ourselves by rolling snake eyes. And all humans supposedly are the result of a myriad these lucky mutations (sifted through by death), yet darwinists now put themselves up on an intellectual pedestol and are proclaiming they have the sole right of telling everyone how diversified, -- yet equally worthless we all are. It's a concept that covers all of the bases for Satan: lucky, random, mindless evolution somehow creates life and yet gives the illusion of equality. Now everyone feels good - and we don't even need God. Go figure.\n \n That's how Satan works, everybody. I bet Satan hates me.....I can already hear his growl, in fact.",

Can you imagine if these intellectual superiors were to aim this predjudice towards groups living today? Of course, they can't do it, so they're forced to put these disgusting skeletons in the closet so they won't be outed as hypocrites.\n Its actually due to smaller brain cases that we think they were less intelligent, coupled with an absense of cultural items discovered at camps from the same time as modern humans existed. The racism stuff is nonsense either, how is this different than saying 'Republicans won't let chimps vote! Imagine if they decide that blacks or hispanics arn't human either! \n \n \n\n But let's look at Neandertals and Homo erectus under the light of reality. Regardless of the fact that homo sapiens, lived alongside both these groups, Evolutionists claim, of course that their traits indicated that they were somehow \"subhuman.\"\n Subhuman isn't a scientific term, they are simply something else. Despite what you think evolution is totally against the concept of higher and lower organisms, the names are really used from a historical point of view merely to categorise organisms (much the same way species is despite being a concept at odds with evolution). The most evolved organisms are those that have undergone the most generations, we're far from the top.\n \n \n\n And see here's one of the items in the evolutionists' bag of tricks: They love to emphasize the postive characteristics of apes, yet at the same time ridicule and downplay the Neandertal and Homo erectus. They play this mind game so they can sub-consciously level the mental playing field and soften people up to the notion that humans and apes are actually closer than they are. It's nothing but a racist snowjob of picking and choosing who they build up or tear down - based on their political agenda. Unlike evolutionists, though, God is not a racist.\n Ge-what? Making out that two things are more similar than people think is racism, all science aside, this just clearly makes no sense! \n \n\n Physical Traits of Neandertals and Homo Erectus:\n \n We've already learned the power of plasticity and adaptivity. It can shape and mold an organism from the moment of conception. Also traits are able to be formed during development that will aid in the functionality of life on the outside. I've given numerous examples of plasticity....one is that tadpoles can develop into a large-headed or small-headed morph depending on diet early on in life. Snakes do the same thing.\n We're talking variation that isn't encoded genetically here aren't we? Less nature vs nuture but full blown Lamarkian evolution?\n \n \n\n My hypothesis, of course, is that Neandertals and Homo erectus are no different. First, it is known that these individuals had very similar physical features...in fact, other than brain size they were almost identical. This might be why the early African Homo sapien fossils have been referred to as \"African Neandertals\"....while many of the Asian homo erectus fossils have been called \"Asian Neandertals.\" And in many cases it's difficult to tell the difference between Neandertals and Erectus fossils.\n You're arguing for evolution here you realise?\n \n \n\n But both groups were no-doubt hunters. Thus, their bodies were shaped for the purpose of living in a harsh environment and for fighting and overpowering their dinner. This required strong bones and a solid body mass. Interestingly the area of the brain that determines these motor functions is - you guessed it -- in the frontal lobe.... the cerebellum. This area was probably enlarged as a result of necessity to cope with their current situation. It has nothing to with being \"subhuman\"...as the rasicsts imply. It has nothing to do with being blood-thirsty savages who carried their wives by their hair either. If anything, it proves the inner intelligence, majesty, and design of the human body.\n Frontal lobe is more importantly the seat of personality and abstract thought, I would have thought development here would be more due to increasely complex social behaviour than just being strong. This fits with what you would expect in the evolution of man, as for blood thirsty savages, I think we've enough examples of that in our less than ancient history to decide that its clearly not a neanderthal thing.\n \n \n\n In addition, these people no doubt used their teeth as tools of sorts - as cutting and clamping devices...thus their teeth and jaw structures were merely transformed by their dietary habits. It would be no different than when I was 8 years old and learned how to play the guitar: God made my fingers adaptive and soon they developed callouses, which allowed me to play without drawing blood - these callouses still remain today.\n So you hold that someone living in cold conditions who used their teeth a lot would be indistinguishable from a neanderthal? Or might the large jaws be working the other way around where earlier hominids where able to eat a greater range of nuts and seeds and required more powerful jaws, but slowly lost them as the diet moved toward more meat and cooked food (australian aboriginals even have a vestigal crest where the jaw muscles would have been anchored).\n \n\n My assertion, thus, is that Neandertals -- who were essentially the same individuals as Homo erectus - at some point migrated out of Africa, took up residence in Europe, and developed rickets as result of climate change. Over the generations, through isolation and possibly some nonrandom genetic mutations cued by the environment, Neandertals became their own \"race\" of people. And that's all they were: People....and this is proven by the fact that their bones were found in the same cave in Germany as \"modern human\" bones - both of which, date at 40-44,000 years ago. (evolutionists' time clock). And it's also proven by their large array of artifacts.\nI'm pretty sure that modern humans came into europe form sunnier climes after the Neanderthals, meaning they had less time to adapt to the reduced sunlight (even with your bizarre version of adaption). Its probably the diet more than anything else.\n \n I'm curious what you mean by nonrandom genetic mutations caused by the environment - we're talking DNA that is changing to purposely alter its structure in a specific way in response to an outside stimulus? Or do you mean a phenotype (how the organism actually is) changing as different genes are turned on and off? \n \n\n Evolutionarily speaking, it has been shown that Homo erectus fossils overlaps the entire Homo habilis (monkey) population. The oldest Homo erectus fossil is dated at just under 2 million years old....the oldest Homo habilis fossil (primate) is dated at just over 2 million years old. The fossil record also shows that homo erectus and homo habilis lived side-by-side for a half a million years (evolutinists time clock). Therefore common sense says that homo erectus (human) could never have evolved from homo habilis (monkey). Not only that, but the fossil record shows that homo erectus lived alongside homo sapiens for 2 million years. Thus, there is no possible way that there was any evolution via random mutations and natural selection could have occurred.\n All Homos are hominids, the lineage verges off from chimps (apes not monkeys) at austrolopithcine far as I know. Speciation is a continuous process though - things do not magically shift from one form into another, on top of this hominid fossils are notoriously incomplete. Add in the fact that erectus could exist alongside the species that gave rise to it and you have a much more complicated situation than you think (even if the numbers are right). \n \n \n The whole secret conspiracy of scientists aspiring to keep blacks in their place is completely insane! Not to mention evolution as it is taught now (and originally conceived) has nothing specifically to do with human evolution. Even if human evolution was totally different from what is currently thought it would have no bearing on the theory at all.\n \n Even better, your entire theory can be completely demolished just by looking at your misunderstanding of the 'missing link'. Lucy is not the direct ancestor of modern humans, and is infact an ancestor of both modern humans and neanderthals - the missing link is the point at which the homo and pan groups split off from each other to eventually form modern humans and chimps.\n \n As for neanderthal rights, last lesson I had on human evolution had them as Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, just a subspecies of modern humans that would be able to interbreed. Might have read somewhere that genetic tests have shown that they might not have interbred with modern humans, but can't remember which way the results came out.",

Instead, you call us \"liberals\" and then call liberals racist.\n \nI'm going to weave all these things together to create a filthy collage\nWell, your reasoning is certainly muddled, and it seems to be confused with some sort of twisted socio-political agenda, but I don't think I would characterize your piece a filthy collage. But you can call you stuff what you want.\n \nThis post...will make more logical sense than any conveluted-writing Darwinist author (Dawkins, Mayr, Eldredge and Darwin himself) could ever dream of presenting.\nOne of the signs of pseudoscience is that the author will claim greatness, greater than some of the finest minds in the field while at the same time he is isolated from any scientists in that field. Another example of this sign is Dembski, who claims to have discovered \"a fourth\" law of thermodynamics, seemingly unaware that there are four already.\n \n Not everyone is willing to say these things. But I'm not afraid to speak my mind.\nNot everyone has delusions of grandeur.\n \nFirst of all it's interesting that Liberals in this country point the finger at Conservatives for being racists when their whole ideological makeup is based on racism.\nPerhaps you should actually learn a bit about the history of this country. Look into the origins of the Southern Baptist Convention and the KKK.\n \nWhen Darwin first dreamed up his monkey theory, he felt that evolution was able to preserve the \"more fit species.\" \nTurns your whole piece into tripe. Darwin didn't \"dream up\" any theory about monkeys. Nor did Darwin even mention the \"more fit species.\" It seems that you are ignorant of the most basic facts of the topic. Your claim to greatness suddenly looks like great foolishness.\n \nInterestingly, he indeed referred to different races as \"species.\"...and this is because evolutionists are fond of placing people in groups.\nNonsense. What simpleton reasoning. Darwin referred to various varieties of species as races. He was not indicating separate species. He used the term in reference to cabbage, dogs, pigeons, cattle, apples, and other domestic animals and plants. Of course, you would have to actually read what Darwin said to realize how ignorant your comment is.\n \n And, of course, it should be pointed out that it was Carolus Linnaeus, a creationist and a Christian, who devised the taxonomic grouping system that is still used by biologists. It seems that Christians are also fond of grouping things. Just look at your penchant for grouping everyone with whom you disagree into evolutionists and liberals.\n \nThey sneer down at anyone like me who doesn't agree with them. Instead of debating the facts, evolutionists will often resort to attacking the intelligence (or lack of it) in their opponent.\nActually, I don't sneer at you. I laugh at you. And I don't attack your intelligence but your knowledge. You are intentionally ignorant.\n \nThey do this with... \nSnip of irrelevant flatulence motivated by political extremism.\n \n As a matter of fact, most racists with whom I have ever been in contact have claimed to be christian.\n \nThe second group is our dead ancestors - who they have no problem besmearing Homo erectus and the Neandertals - who are both fully human. They have successfully convinced the public through a series of lies that because these groups of individuals look different, that they are somehow \"less human\" -- therefore not deserving of full human status. Just because they may have had large, dense features (big, bulky bones, large heads) evolutionists have surmised that their brains are \"less sophisticated\", \"less fit\" and \"less-wired\" than modern brains.\nOr maybe their brains were smaller, as in the case of H. erectus, or larger, as in the case of H. neanderthalensis. Maybe what is being said is that they were different.\n \nBut let's look at Neandertals and Homo erectus under the light of reality. Regardless of the fact that homo sapiens, lived alongside both these groups, Evolutionists claim, of course that their traits indicated that they were somehow \"subhuman.\"\nThat's a lie. They were not us, but the designation Homo makes them human.\n \nGod is not a racist.\nBut many christians are.\n \nMy hypothesis, of course, is that Neandertals and Homo erectus are no different.\nDon't bother. Your premise was shown to be wrong long ago. It is possible that H. erectus or some related species was ancestral to the Neanderthals.\n \nFirst, it is known that these individuals had very similar physical features...in fact, other than brain size they were almost identical.\nNo, they weren't.\n \nIn addition, we've learned that Neandertals most certainly had rickets.\nA lie.\n \n(Interestingly it's been shown that almost every Neandertal child studied had rickets)\nAnother lie.\n \nAnd here's something important. What you have to remember is that Neandertals and Homo Erectus, lived in the same general geological environment as apes.\nNope.\n \nEvolutionarily speaking, it has been shown that Homo erectus fossils overlaps the entire Homo habilis (monkey) population.\nStupidity. Now who is being racist? It's funny how evolutionists consider H. habilis to be human while you call them monkeys. Your following discussion shows your abject ignorance of the topic. Try to learn something before you speak.\n \nHang with me, man....hold my hand -- I'll guide you right through this twisted madness....\nAt least you characterize your writing accurately. But again, your twisted madness shows a lack of education. Why don't you educate yourself first?\n \nI mean the evolutionists have succeeded in convincing a large portion of the public that it's better to be related to Lucy than it is to be related to Neandertals --- \nMore flatulence. We are much more closely related to Neanderthals than we are to any australopithecine.\n \nbecause who in their right minds wants to be known as a descendant to a bunch of disgusting Brutes? No one!\nWell, that is the argument that one hears from creationists so often. So when are you going to get to the most delicious, highly satisfying entertainment? Even more important, when are you going to expose the theory of evolution? YOu don't seriously propose that your little series of cow pies is actually meaningful, do you?",

It is getting a little annoying, and if we just ignore his posts he'll claim victory, which is sad but still a pain. Any suggestions?\n\n Though I am just an observer on this thread, might I suggest the following. I would think that the main goal in any response to SS would be to keep uninformed and impressionable readers from being convinced by his arguements. From that point of view, his goal is to have the appearance of winning the arguement even if he has not actually won the arguement, so the responses would have to keep him from gaining that appearance of victory. \n \n So, I might suggest that, after his first post, people respond by either re-submitting the same rebuttals or giving a link to those rebuttals. Then, challenge him to pick one arguement of his choosing on which to have a detailed debate with supporting links and stick to that point. If he ignores the challenge or declines, imply that he is a coward (in calm and toned down language). In all subsequent responses on the thread, don't respond to his new attacks but only keep repeating this challenge until he either gives up and leaves the thread or gives in and actually debates the point. The last image that will have been left of SS is that he is a coward - not an image that will convince any impressionable readers of his arguements.\n \n Anyway, that is just an idea. Certainly SS might be crafty enough to get around it. He takes pleasure in seeing evolution supporters get angry - which he then distorts. Simply deny him the angry response and treat him as what he is - an adult with the emotional control and irrationality of a child.",

   "Another opinion, hasn't his level of courage been proven? after all he has yet to post on a thread supporting evolution. My threads been here for a couple days and nothing...\n\n The problem with SS is a general problem with people who try to win with insult instead of with reasoned arguement. It is not necessarily the person they are arguing with that they are trying to convince. They are simply trying to look strong and confident in their arguement and win converts to their cause by force of personality alone. They don't feel like they need to respond if they have won that war of personalities. Indeed, they have everything to lose if they respond with a reasoned response because they probably know that their arguement is hard to fully support. The seasoned debater might see through their methods but that doesn't matter to them since it is not the seasoned debater that they are trying to convince but the inexperienced, impressionable reader.\n \n I would think that part of the trick is not to let them win that war of personalities so that the inexperienced reader does not get convinced. If SS's posts result in a lot of angry posts from evolution supporters, then he might feel a sense of strength at having elicited such responses and the impressionable reader might admire that strength. I think it is important to show his weakness by confronting him with challenges and calling him a coward if he does not meet the challenges. That paints him as weak if he leaves the thread since it paints him as the coward he is. If you present a challenge without the added confrontation of calling him a coward, then he might feel perfectly free to avoid the challenge since it would not carry as much of a sign of weakness.",

   "Please note beforehand - I am not calling anyone on this board or any other specific evolutionist a racist. I'm merely stating a premise - that this thoery is based on nothing but the philosophy of racism. This will become very apparent towards the end of the post. (I did not make this theory up - I'm merely reporting the details.)\n\n Yes, I know. This has been put forth by great scholarly minds (note my sarcasm) like Kent Hovind in the past. It's tired, uncreative, and boring.\n \n \nIn this post I am also going to destroy Toe by showing that the Neandertals did not evolve their physical characteristics through random mutations and natural selection. Instead, they developed them God's way - the intelligent way. I'm going to weave all these things together to create a filthy collage that depicts what the theory of evolution really stands for. This post will tie everything together and will make more logical sense than any conveluted-writing Darwinist author (Dawkins, Mayr, Eldredge and Darwin himself) could ever dream of presenting. Not everyone is willing to say these things. But I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I have an inner desire to uncover and expose the raw truth - of which evolutionists hate.\n\n Oh what a corageous maverick you are.\n \n \nFirst of all it's interesting that Liberals in this country point the finger at Conservatives for being racists when their whole ideological makeup is based on racism. When Darwin first dreamed up his monkey theory, he felt that evolution was able to preserve the \"more fit species.\" Interestingly, he indeed refered to different races as \"species.\"...and this is because evolutionists are fond of placing people in groups. They love to separate by ethnic, cultural and religious basis...(They can't help themselves.) Of course now they shroud this under the guize of \"diversity\" -- which is to get around this obvious obsession to label people. They do this to trick the masses and divert attention of who they really are - meanwhile pointing the finger at others. At the heart of this diversity madness, though, is the evil concept of different groups of people being \"more fit\" than other groups. This is the real origin of racism.\n\n You're absolutely right. No one put people into superficial groups and hated them based on that grouping before Darwin came along with his atheist, divisive, God-hating \"theory.\" I'm glad someone finally said it.\n \n \n \nOf course, as I see it, evolutionists are doing a geat job of hiding their inner racism towards modern-day groups. But there's a very clever diversion going on here. Instead of being outspoken and audibly racist against anyone who could potentially vote against them, they're outspoken and racists towards the helpless and inconsequential. The first group is unborn children - of whom they have no problem murdering. The second group is our dead ancestors - who they have no problem besmearing: Homo erectus and the Neandertals - who are both fully human. They have successfully convinced the public through a series of lies that because these groups of individuals look different, that they are somehow \"less human\" -- therefore not deserving of full human status. Just because they may have had large, dense features (big, bulky bones, large heads) evolutionists have surmised that their brains are \"less sophisticated\", \"less fit\" and \"less-wired\" than modern brains. Can you imagine if these intellectual superiors were to aim this predjudice towards groups living today? Of course, they can't do it, so they're forced to put these disgusting skeletons in the closet so they won't be outed as hypocrites.\n\n I mean, you're right, they are racist against babies. I'm glad you informed me of this. Before this enlightening post I had no idea babies constituted their own race. Not to mention the fact that I now know that Homo Erectus, Neandertals, and Homo Sapien Sapien are all the exact same species.\n \n \nMy hypothesis, of course, is that Neandertals and Homo erectus are no different. First, it is known that these individuals had very similar physical features...in fact, other than brain size they were almost identical. This might be why the early African Homo sapien fossils have been referred to as \"African Neandertals\"....while many of the Asian homo erectus fossils have been called \"Asian Neandertals.\" And in many cases it's difficult to tell the difference between Neandertals and Erectus fossils.\n\n I can't wait to see you put your hypothesis to the test and read about it in a journal. You let me know when that happens. I'm so excited.\n \n \nIn addition, these people no doubt used their teeth as tools of sorts - as cutting and clamping devices...thus their teeth and jaw structures were merely transformed by their dietary habits. It would be no different than when I was 8 years old and learned how to play the guitar: God made my fingers adaptive and soon they developed callouses, which allowed me to play without drawing blood - these callouses still remain today.\n\n Yet again you enlighten me. I have been playing guitar for years, all the while in excrutiating pain from my fingers bleeding. Now I know all I needed was divine intervention for callouses. I will pray this evening for them.\n \n \nEvolutionarily speaking, it has been shown that Homo erectus fossils overlaps the entire Homo habilis (monkey) population. The oldest Homo erectus fossil is dated at just under 2 million years old....the oldest Homo habilis fossil (primate) is dated at just over 2 million years old. The fossil record also shows that homo erectus and homo habilis lived side-by-side for a half a million years (evolutinists time clock). Therefore common sense says that homo erectus (human) could never have evolved from homo habilis (monkey). Not only that, but the fossil record shows that homo erectus lived alongside homo sapiens for 2 million years. Thus, there is no possible way that there was any evolution via random mutations and natural selection could have occurred.\n\n Yes, homo habilus was a monkey. I've been telling people that for years.\n \n \nThus the obvious conclusion from this scenario is that Africans (Blacks), due to the fact that they started evolving later than Europeans and Asians, are almost 400,000 years behind these other groups in evolutionary standards. Thus, they got a late start! This realization might explain the intellectual superiority of Darwinists of the past - and why they have a history of referring to black people as \"savages.\" But obviously, present day Darwinists live in their fairytale land of Political Correctness and they now feel the need to hide this little problem. And thus, they've hidden it by steering people around the scenerio that all humans evolved from Homo erectus! This is the dirty little, disgusting secret you'll never hear on CNN. And the truth is that evolutionists have made up a big, fat whopper to save face to the black community - of whom they require votes. And this is regardless of what the evidence shows.\n\n Interesting approach you take here. You say that blacks got a late start evolving, are intellectually inferior, and yet you call evolutionists racists.\n \n \nBut the mental war has been won. Lucy is now the hero - which everyone, evidently, is ok with. I mean the evolutionists have succeeded in convincing a large portion of the public that it's better to be related to Lucy than it is to be related to Neandertals --- because who in their right minds wants to be known as a descendant to a bunch of disgusting Brutes? No one! (This is despite the fact that these \"Brutes\" were shown to bury their dead and make/use an assortment of tools, fire, etc) Thus, evolutionists, in all their atheist, racist glory, have relentlessly ridiculed and downgraded our true human ancestors over the decades.....and just like our unborn babies -- they've systematically killed them all off.\n\n It is sad that they killed all the neandertals off. I was so hoping to be able to see them in the wild in my lifetime.",

   "You're absolutely right. No one put people into superficial groups and hated them based on that grouping before Darwin came along with his atheist, divisive, God-hating \"theory.\" I'm glad someone finally said it.\n\n By his logic, we could liken the whole \"God gave dominion over the earth and the animals of the earth\" philosophy a label of \"slavery\" and/or \"racism\"...\n \n He actually has a problem with recognizing when one feature is better than another?\n It's like he's trying to out-liberal what he thinks a \"liberal\" is...\n \n \n \nI mean, you're right, they are racist against babies. I'm glad you informed me of this. Before this enlightening post I had no idea babies constituted their own race. Not to mention the fact that I now know that Homo Erectus, Neandertals, and Homo Sapien Sapien are all the exact same species.\n\n He's trying to personalize history.\n Like saying, \"You say that you these founding fathers owned slaves? You must hate them to say that...\"\n \n It's just noting an OBSERVATION.\n The observation wasn't made up of an attempt to slander, but rather an observation of a theory and how things could have historically worked.\n \n \n \nInteresting approach you take here.
