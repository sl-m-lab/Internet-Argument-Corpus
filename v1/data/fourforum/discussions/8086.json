   "Yes a deluded bunch. I still think being a gay republican is akin to being a jewish nazi. I just don't understand how anyone can be apart of an organization that has an anti gay platform. An organization that seeks favor of groups that are waging war against lbgt people. An organiztion that dismisses our families, fights aginst our rights, and is trying to turn every lgbt person and their family into permanent second class citizens. I guess some people are so Masochistic that they would hold the gun to their heads and apologize to the gun man, as they lay dying, for getting blood on his shoes.",

   "I saw a special on TV once on \"log cabin republicans\". They were debating their actions on the upcoming election considering Bush's anti-gay stance on some issues and whether or not to \"endorse\" him. Some were of the mind to not endorse him. Others directly stated that *we call ourselves log cabin REPUBLICANS*, so we should be republicans. I thought it was mindless as the entire point of the organization is GAY REPUBLICANS, and those people were just ignoring the importance of the first part of that to focus exclusively on the second.\n \n Why not just call yourselves \"republicans\" and leave the \"gay\" part out then if it's not that important?\n \n Regardless, the local chapter actually voted to withhold endorsement of Bush, and one of the more staunch \"republican\" members was accompanied by a video crew as he went door to door in the gay neighborhood of town to knock on their doors and ask them who they were voting for, and then ARGUED WITH THEM if they didn't say Bush.\n \n Ain't that just lovely? You're sitting in your home, minding your own business. Some guy knocks on your door with a video crew behind him, and asks who you are voting and debates you ON YOUR DOORSTEP if he doesn't like your answer.\n \n (Is it plain I thought this guy was a putz?)",
