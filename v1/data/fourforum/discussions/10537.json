   "Holy cow, I heard this on the news this morning. A lot of people are saying who cares because the story is over and Dumbledore never really existed anyways so why reveal information that has nothing to do with the story. Others are saying they knew it all along because of the lack of any female love interest for Dumbledore. Very interesting...I think Rowling is very sneaky by revealing Dumbledore as gay AFTER everybody has read and enjoyed the books. Can you imagine the parental outrage if she told us that years ago? Many kids would be prevented from reading those books by the same people who claimed HP was about witchcraft. Dumbledore is a revered character in HP, and now that he is gay maybe it will inspire children to believe that \"gay doesn't equal bad\". \n \n http://movies.msn.com/movies/article.aspx?news=280433&GT1=7701",

   "Somehow, I suspect not too many doctoral theses are going to be written on the topic of Dumbledore's sexual orientation, or how JK Rowling's perception of his character as gay (assuming she isn't pulling people's collective leg) influenced his development in the series. I just don't take the stories that seriously, though they were fun.\n \n However, I believe that the series was particularly popular in the gay community. I base this on the prominence of the books in Outwrite, one of the gay bookstores in Atlanta, when the series was still young. They don't have room for everything in gay bookstores, especially not for ostensibly straight literature, but they did have room for Harry Potter, and not at discount prices, either.\n \n If I'm right, it's probably not too difficult to guess why: wizards were secretive, magical creatures in a prosaic Muggle world that was afraid of and despised magic. They had to conceal themselves, and lead semi-secret lives in order to be left in peace. Many gays probably see themselves in a similar light with themselves as creating a special world that's a little out of the ordinary compared to the dull, quotidian straight world they are forced to hide from. Gays, like Rowling's wizards, have to assume protective coloration to avoid harassment. Gays, like wizards, have ways of knowing each other that straights and Muggles aren't aware of -- a glance here, a knowing, arch look there.\n \n I see no reason to think that Rowling had deliberately intended such parallels, and frankly I strongly doubt she ever did (or does now) consider the series to have any sort of gay theme. Not even Dumbledore, who never struck me as remotely sexual at all. Maybe she's pandering, who knows? But there are clear resonances obvious to anyone who has lived in the gay demi-monde.\n \n You straight folk may not be able to pick up these resonances, but that's because you're Muggles!",

Of course, their motive is not the only part of the equation. What is the negative consequence for males of their discrimination? Nothing major that I can see, so if women's colleges see fit to disagree with me, I'm not going to have a conniption about it. In an educational society that for the most part doesn't discriminate against women, what's the harm? And if there is some residual discrimination against women, which is very plausible, then again, what is the harm? It's not as though these colleges are publicly funded and dedicated for equal opportunities to men and women alke. They exist, as they see it, to afford equal opportunities for women that would not otherwise exist, i.e. to redress an existing imbalance.\n \n \nThat's the standard you set for discrimination against gays, so you've made your bed, now lay in it.

Discrimination by a tiny proportion of colleges in favour of women, already a disadvantaged group in modern society, doesn't even begin to compare with discrimination against gays, who are also a traditionally disadvantaged group. Even if one were to admit they are on the same spectrum of discrimination, the degree of their consequences, and the provenance of their motives, sets them streets apart.\n \n \nIt's not my problem that your argument is ultimately inconsistent and therefore hypocritical to some extent. Don't expect people not to point that out when it happens.\n\n \n There is no hypocrisy involved here at all. Women, like gays, have been a traditionally disadvantaged group in Christendom. So here we have a tiny handful of colleges catering exclusively for women who might feel they don't get a fair shake in a patriarchal culture, and you compare this to discrimination against gays in a heterosexist culture? Apples and oranges, mate. That's private affirmative action, and who would condemn them for it? You, obviously.\n \n Give me a friggin' break. This ploy of yours doesn't even pass the giggle test. I'm still chortlin'. You're triflin' with us, my dear josh. Discrimination in a tiny minority of colleges against males doesn't even begin to compare with discrimination against gays in greater society at large.

We all read our experiences into literature and art. One can read contemporary culture into most any story, and it's going to mean different things to different people. \n\n \n Of course the moral isn't original, but truly original themes are hard to come by. If we insisted only on pristinely original insights into human nature from every novellist rather than an original setting and story, literature would probably have stopped with Aesop's Fables.\n \n If one can't see contemporary culture reflected in a story, I'd suspect that its appeal is going to be comparatively limited. Now considering what Rowling seemed at first to have set out to achieve, namely a set of stories that English kids would enjoy reading, one is left trying to explain why she is also so popular among adults, and internationally. And I did try to explain why I thought she hit some special resonances among her gay readership.\n \n I don't think her success can be attributed to sheer luck or accident, or to some sort of mass, pop hysteria, or that just any other old story or theme could have been as effective. I think she managed to hit a motherlode of feelings and experience that works across the board, in many cultures. Now THAT was real magic.\n \n \nThe fact that someone can take something like Harry Potter and read 'reaction against Thatcher-conservatism' there, only goes to show that, but I still think it's stretch.\n\n \n Well, British internal politics for the last ten years have been a story of reaction against Thatcherism, which is why even today, the Conservative party still doesn't look like a natural party of government, and is still gasping to recover. Still, although I can't say I saw a specifically anti-Thatcher message in the Harry Potter series, Rowling's politics (such as they are) do seem at odds with a lot of Thatcher's Randist-style ideals. But I wouldn't read much more than concern for one's fellow man, and praise of self-sacrifice for the good of others, into her message.\n \n I've even read of some people finding a spiritually Christian message in her writings, which is ironic given how so many Christian fundies denounce her for Devil-worship and witchcraft! I think she's just made some points that people universally find appealing, at least as individuals.\n \n \nSometimes entertainment just for the sake of entertainment 'ain't a bad thing.\n\n \n No-one would deny it, but Rowling CAN be read at more than the shallow level for those discerning enough to see beyond it. That adds to the value of the books as sheer entertainment for those who won't or can't see beyond that level. One doesn't have to go beyond that level, but why scoff at those who do, and find the trip inspirational?",

Well, become sloppy thinkers, anyway. They may turn to religion for comfort, but they don't make much sense when they do it! Of course, maybe that's why I never really liked his Narnia chronicles.

   "Another interesting take on Gay Dumbledore story:\n \n Is Dumbledore Gay? Depends on Definitions of 'Is' and 'Gay'\n \n From the conclusion:\n \n \n[Rowling's] heroes are the hybrids, the misfits, those of mixed blood, all bearing scars of loss and love: the half-giant Hagrid, the mudblood Hermione (whose parents were not wizards), the poverty-stricken Ron, the orphaned Harry. Perhaps speaking of Dumbledore as gay was just a matter of creating another diverse rebel against orthodoxy.\n \n This is the formula for much popular fiction, but Ms. Rowling refuses to be content with simply rejecting the old order and championing a morally vague multiculturalism. The pure-bloods here are blinded by their pride, but Harry and his friends see something more profound, a threat that goes beyond self-interest and identity. This is why Dumbledore's supposed gayness is ultimately as unimportant as Ron's shabby clothes. These wounded outsiders recognize the nature of evil, and finally that is what matters.\n\n \n I have to agree. What is important is not whether the fictional Dumbledore was gay (or even sexual!), or even that Rowling decided to retrofit him with gay apparel -- I don't seriously imagine that anyone reading the books is ever going to have an Aha! moment and say unprompted, \"Of course! Albus is gay as a goose!\" It's the championing of the misfit and the unorthodox against tradition, convention and conformity. \n \n Of course, many people (perhaps most?) see themselves as misfits at least on occasion. Some with more justice than others. Mix that common thread in with the immortal battle of good and evil and you get a heady and popular cocktail.",
