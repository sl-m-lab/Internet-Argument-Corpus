And a pro-gay totalitarian system is no more humane than an anti-gay one.\n \n Do not interpret this as support for gay oppression, rather that any moral opposition to oppression of gays must also reject oppression of other groups, for example women or christians.",

There are a lot of Muslims in Nigeria who want Sharia law imposed. Being homophobic is something that unites both sides.",
