In the final ballot, he defeated Katon Dawson, the South Carolina Republican chairman, drawing 91 of the 165 votes.\n \n From the start, Mr. Dawson, while well-liked in the party, was hampered by worries that his selection would reinforce the notion that Republicans are increasingly becoming a Southern regional party. Mr. Dawson also withdrew from an all-white country club he belonged before he started running for office, a point that was raised by Republicans concerned that it would provide a bad contrast in a year when the country elected its first African-American president.\n\n \n =snip=",

Michael Steele is a great guy and a great choice as Chairman of the RNC or any position he holds in the Party of Lincoln. Here's a video of him delivering his speech at the convention for those who don't know who he is.\n \n YouTube - GOPAC Chairman Michael Steele at RNC\n \n God willing, he can inject some guts into the Republicans before they completely buckle under to Obamas sellout er, I mean bailout program. :xbanghead",
