Not as accurate as my Kimber .45 CDPII, but much less expensive and the Glock fits easily in the front pocket of a pair of jeans. You can also pick it up in .357 Sig. A lot of Va. state troopers carry the 27 in .357 as an off-duty weapon because that's the state police duty weapon cartridge.\n \n For whatever weapon you choose I would take .40 over the 9 because it's just a better cartridge.

   "If you want a 9, the P228 is absolutly unbeatable. It is one of the cheaper guns I own, but I have put thousands of rounds through it and it has NEVER had a feed problem. Not even once. It is the only gun I have ever owned that I can say that about. Even my glocks have occasionally just decided not to eat a round. The 228 is a little pricier new than what you are lookig ot spend, but I would have absolutly no reservations about buying one on the second hand market. \n \n The Kimber Ten II in .45 is a nice weapon and has the mag capacity and the price you are looking for, but it just does not feel right in my hand. Your hand may be different.\n \n In .40, the glock 22 is an OK weapon, with a low price tag (around $600). The 4006 from smith is a nice looking weapon, but I found the slide to be stiff, and the trigger pull was TERRIBLE. Stay away form the Walther p99. It is constnatly decocking the striker rather than firing, and I have only ever managed to get a few clips to fire wihtout the slide locking back prematurely. I can't even sell the POS. \n \n My choice in the .40 has to be either the HK USP, a fine pistol if ever there was one, OR, the P229 from Sig. When I got my P229, the first 20 or 30 rounds the slide failed to lock back occasionally when the mag was empty. After that, it has functioned flawlessly for the thousands of rounds I have put through it. The initial slide lock problem is the only reason I do not rate it quite as high for reliability as the P228, which is always perfect right out of the box. It is almost like the lcokign mechanism was a little stiff from the factory and had to loosen up a bit.\n \n Really, the 228 or 229 would be my choice. Glock makes a fine weapon, but I think that Sig beats them by a hair. BUT, when youa re talking somethign that you may have to bet your life on, whether a hair or a mile does not matter, what matters is that they are beat.\n \n \n In the end, the best gun is the one you can hit with, and the only way you are going to know what you can hit with is by goign out and shooting a bunch of different models. Not all guns are the same. For example, I can hit GREAT with the P228 or P229. I can do 2\" groups with them with the sights off the gun. A P226, though, has a little different grip angle and I can't hit with it worth a damn. My wife hits really well with a colt, full sized or commander size, but you hand her a Glock and she could not hit a barn if she was standing in it. I do some competition shooting with a .45. After shooting a really good score one day, a buddy tossed me a .45 that was kind of funny feeling. I shot twice and missed the target completely on both shots. It was a Llama and the grip angle is a little different and the barrel to top of slide is a little taller than most .45s. On the other hand, the modified colt that I shoot in competition has a vastly differnt grip angle than my STI, but I hit with both just fine. \n \n There seems to just be a narrow range for most folks that, if they are unlucky enough to be holding a pistol that falls in that range, their hand eye coordination goes to hell or they cannot hold their arm quite steady with their wrist at certain angles. I don't know exactly why it is, but I DO know that is why elite military units (seals, delta force, etc..) are allowed to pick their own sidearms. In fact, in some units, if they don't have anything that seems to work for you, they will order you something special. Thats is because those guys are expected to be able to double tap a head in a very short time, every time. You cannot do that if you and your weapon are incompatible.",

If the only shot you can get is a center of mass shot or (ugh) a soft tissue shot, the .40 could give you an advantage.\n \n Then again, considering the excess magazine capacity in most 9mm pistols, there is no reason to ever fire a single shot at an adversary. With .40 or .45, you often are wise to try to conserve ammo where you can, which may cause you to hesitate to pop off that second or third round. I will take 2 9mm rounds over 1 .40 rd any day. \n \n you make a good point about ammos as well.

They aren't. And the ammo is dirt cheap. And my 22 Marlin rifle is cheap and accurate. But IF you really, really, really want to stop an elephant get a .357 Magnum.
