   "What was very interesting to discover was that in addition to creating the junk science that promotes the fear of Global Warming, Gore has also invested in the Carbon Credits Industry as a Shareholder so he can capitalize on the fear he creates in those who think they can subsidize their personal polluting lifestyle by purchasing carbon credits. What a great scam, create the fear in something and then profit from the solution for the fear you have created. \n \n 'Another Inconvenient Truth': BusinessWeek Busts Al Gore and Carbon Offsets\n Posted by Noel Sheppard on March 19, 2007 - 00:21. \n As reported by NewsBusters here, here, here, and here, this has been an awful week for global warming alarmists and their hero, soon-to-be-Dr. Al Gore. From an unfavorable article about him in the New York Times, to a Gallup poll showing that Americans aren't buying into his junk science, Gore must feel a long way from Hollywood and Oscar night.\n \n Marvelously adding to the torture was BusinessWeek magazine which published an article stating that carbon offsets \"amount to little more than feel-good hype\" (h/t American Thinker). \n \n As previously addressed here, carbon credits or offsets are a theoretical way for one to assuage one's guilt for all those awful greenhouse gases you're releasing into the air whenever you heat your home, drive your car, or eat too many beans. \n \n Unfortunately, these offsets aren't what they seem (emphasis added throughout):\n \n Done carefully, offsets can have a positive effect and raise ecological awareness. But a close look at several transactions-including those involving the Oscar presenters, Vail Resorts, and the Seattle power company-reveals that some deals amount to little more than feel-good hype. When traced to their source, these dubious offsets often encourage climate protection that would have happened regardless of the buying and selling of paper certificates. One danger of largely symbolic deals is that they may divert attention and resources from more expensive and effective measures.\n \n Hmmm. So, someone purchasing an offset from such a company really isn't offsetting anything, for no additional greenhouse gas is being removed as a result of the transaction? Please tell us more:\n \n Hollywood celebrated environmental activism at this year's Academy Awards, and not just by giving an Oscar to the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences promoted the show itself having \"gone green,\" by means of a variety of initiatives. One element: Each performer and presenter received a glass statue representing the elimination of the amount of greenhouse gas associated with a celebrity lifestyle over the course of a year. The offsets were issued by TerraPass Inc., a two-year-old for-profit company in San Francisco that identifies climate-protection efforts and, for a fee, gives its customers the opportunity to buy a piece of the environmental action. Each Oscar favor represented 100,000 pounds of emission reductions drawn from TerraPass' portfolio of offset projects.\n \n One of the largest in its portfolio is a sprawling garbage dump outside of Springdale, Ark., from which TerraPass has purchased thousands of tons of gas reductions. The vast sloping mound of the Tontitown landfill rises near stands of bare-limbed hickory and oak trees, with the blue Ozark foothills in the background. The decomposing trash generates methane, a gas 23 times as potent as carbon dioxide in trapping heat in the earth's atmosphere, melting glaciers and raising ocean levels. Waste Management Inc., (WMI ) the huge garbage processor that operates the facility, tends nearly 90 wells dotting the trash mountain, each giving off a barely audible hiss as it sucks methane from the depths of the landfill and delivers the gas to a single towering flare. Once torched, the gas is released into the atmosphere as less-damaging co2. But company officials and Arkansas environmental regulators say Waste Management began to burn methane, and continues to do so, for reasons having nothing to do with TerraPass' offsets.\n \n Sorry for the complexities here, folks. However, here's the marvelous punch line: \n \n Concerned that methane might be contaminating groundwater beneath the landfill, Waste Management first floated the idea for a gas-collection system in early 1999. Arkansas regulators urged the company to pursue this remedy. In 2001 the state increased its pressure by imposing a requirement for \"corrective action\" at the Tontitown facility. Waste Management promised to make the methane flare operational by late 2001. After probes subsequently detected methane levels exceeding allowable levels, Dennis John Burks, then chief of the Solid Waste Management Div. of the Arkansas Environmental Quality Dept., wrote to Waste Management on June 27, 2001, saying that the state \"strongly urges WM to bring the newly installed Tontitown Landfill gas extraction system online as soon as possible.\"\n \n [...] \n \n Regardless of who deserves credit for taking the initiative, one thing is clear: The methane system was launched long before any promise of carbon-offset sales. In other words, it appears that the main effects of the TerraPass offsets in this instance are to salve guilty celebrity consciences and provide Waste Management, a $13 billion company based in Houston, with some extra revenue.\n \n Isn't that spectacular? In the end, folks purchasing offsets from this entity were basically just giving money to one of America's largest refuse disposal companies while not creating any positive environmental impact that wouldn't have occurred anyway.\n \n In plain English, such a concerned Greenie offset absolutely none of their own greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n Certainly, it goes without saying that \"60 Minutes\" or any of the mainstream media outlets aren't going to make this headline news any time soon.\n \n And, this is anything but rare:\n \n All six other project developers selling offsets to TerraPass that BusinessWeek was able to contact said they were pleased with the extra cash. But five of the six said the offsets hadn't played a significant role in their decision to cut emissions. \"It's just icing on the cake,\" says Barry Edwards, director of utilities and engineering at Catawba County, N.C., which installed a system in 1998 to turn landfill gas into electricity to power 944 homes. \"We would have done this project anyway.\"\n \n As such, the next time you hear some liberal like Dr. Gore claim that he's offsetting the tremendous greenhouse gas emissions from his lavish lifestyle by purchasing carbon offsets, consider the likelihood that nothing could be further from the truth.\n \n Of course, as folks that are buying into this junk science clearly are lacking in cranial capacity, it shouldn't be a surprise how easily they're lured into such scams. After all, as Gordon Gecko accurately proclaimed in the movie \"Wall Street,\" a fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.\n \n www.newsbusters.org/node/11496",

   "And here's the evidence of how he's buying his credits from himself and profiting from his own scare tactics. If a Conservative were exposed in such a scam the attack dogs would be relentless in seeking blood sacrifices. And the Dems in Congress would be calling for Prison time before the trial even took place. \n \n But hey, he's a liberal so he should successfully parley this into the Nobel Prize and a run for President. Another example of hypocricy on the left. Just like when Rosie condemned the Donald, a Republican, for cutting a break to a straight Miss America while excusing the obvious emotional abuse her liberal buddy Alec Baldwin commited against his 11 year old daughter. This just further proves that the left doesn't take their moral stands based on values but based on who's doing what and what side they're on. \n \n February 28, 2007\n The Profit of Doom\n As the controversy over global warming doomsayer Al Gore's voracious energy-eater mansion rolls on, there's an angle I think merits deeper investigation than it is currently getting. While much of the focus has been on whether or not Gore is an environmental hypocrite, the story has raised the profile of the role of \"carbon offsets\" in achieving a \"greener,\" more environmentally friendly world.\n \n In its original story, The Tennessean reported that Gore buys \"carbon offsets\" to compensate for his home's use of energy from carbon-based fuels. As Wikipedia explains, a carbon offset \"is a service that tries to reduce the net carbon emissions of individuals or organizations indirectly, through proxies who reduce their emissions and/or increase their absorption of greenhouse gases.\"\n \n Wikipedia goes on to explain that \"a wide variety of offset actions are available; tree planting is the most common. Renewable energy and energy conservation offsets are also popular, including emissions trading credits.\"\n \n So far, so good. But how Gore buys his \"carbon offsets,\" as revealed by The Tennessean raises serious questions. According to the newspaper's report, Gore's spokesperson said Gore buys his carbon offsets through Generation Investment Management:\n \n Gore helped found Generation Investment Management, through which he and others pay for offsets. The firm invests the money in solar, wind and other projects that reduce energy consumption around the globe, she said...\n Gore is chairman of the firm and, presumably, draws an income or will make money as its investments prosper. In other words, he \"buys\" his \"carbon offsets\" from himself, through a transaction designed to boost his own investments and return a profit to himself. To be blunt, Gore doesn't buy \"carbon offsets\" through Generation Investment Management - he buys stocks.\n \n And it is not clear at all that Gore's stock purchases - excuse me, \"carbon offsets\" purchases - actually help reduce the use of carbon-based energy at all, while the gas lanterns and other carbon-based energy burners at his house continue to burn carbon-based fuels and pump carbon emissions - a/k/a/ \"greenhouse gases\" - into the atmosphere.\n \n Gore's people tout his purchase of \"carbon offsets\" as evidence that he lives a \"carbon-neutral\" lifestyle, but the truth is Gore's home uses electricity that is, for the most part, derived from the burning of carbon fuels. His house gets its electricity from Nashville Electric Service, which gets its from the Tennessee Valley Authority, which produces most of its power from coal-burning power plants. Which means most of the power being consumed at the Gore mansion comes from carbon-emitting power sources. \n \n Wikipedia again:\n \n The intended goal of carbon offsets is to combat global warming. The appeal of becoming \"carbon neutral\" has contributed to the growth of voluntary offsets, which often are a more cost-effective alternative to reducing one's own fossil-fuel consumption. However, the actual amount of carbon reduction (if any) from an offset project is difficult to measure, largely unregulated, and vulnerable to misrepresentation.\n Did you get that? Carbon offsets are an \"alternative to reducing one's own fossil-fuel consumption\" and yet \"the actual amount of carbon reduction (if any) from an offset project is difficult to measure, largely unregulated, and vulnerable to misrepresentation.\"\n \n One way to misrepresent things: Tell a newspaper your stock purchases are really purchases of \"carbon offsets.\"\n \n Meanwhile, Gore runs around the country and the world trumpeting \"climate crisis\" and blaming man's use of carbon-based energy - burning thousands of gallons of jet fuel as he goes. His efforts have served to put climate change at the top of the national and even global agenda, driving up the value of the stocks and companies viewed as \"green\" or environmentally friendly. Companies like those his investment management firm invest his own and other peoples' money in. (You can see a list of Generation Investment Management's holdings here, courtesy of the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission.)\n \n As one commenter posting here and on other blogs has noted:\n \n Hmmm. The Goracle is chairman and a founding partner of Generation Investment Management LLP, a boutique international investment firm that invests other peoples' money, for a fee, into the stocks of 'green' companies. ... So when Al beats the drum for possible future global warming, he's also drumming up business.\n And profiting from hyping the \"global warming\" crisis.\n \n In a nutshell, Gore consumes large amounts of carbon-based electricity while he trumpets a growing \"global warming\" crisis that drives up the value of \"green\" companies like the ones in which he buys carbon offsets invests in their stocks.\n \n A primary rule of good investigative journalism is, \"Follow the money.\" The media - and perhaps the SEC - ought to take a deeper look at Gore, Generation Investment Management and his carbon offset stock purchases.\n \n Asides:\n Gore's huge electric power usage at his Nashville home isn't the only example of how the prophet profit of environmental doom hasn't always lived as if he believes his message. During the eight years Gore was vice president, he voted in four national elections. Every single time, he and his entourage and security detail and accompanying media flew to Nashville on a large government jet, burning thousands of gallons of fossil fuels and pumping huge amounts of carbon emissions directly into the earth's atmosphere, and then drove in a caravan of fossil fuel-burning vehicles from Nashville International Airport east on I-40 to Carthage, Tennessee, so the local and national TV cameras could get video of him at the voting booth. And then the whole caravan headed back to Nashville for the plane ride back to DC. Traffic had to be halted on Nashville's interstates and side streets every time - sometimes during rush hour - idling thousand of vehicles that just sat there, burning fossil fuels and emitting carbon pollution, just so Gore could create a media photo-op.\n \n He could have instead voted by mailing in an absentee ballot.\n \n Also... Pajamas Media has photos of Gore's energy-devouring Nashville home. And while some bloggers have likened \"carbon offsets\" to the \"indulgences\" the pre-Reformation Catholic Church sold to the wealthy so they could continue to sin, ithe blogger at The Virginian says carbon offsets are more like the \"sumptuary laws\" of medieval times, laws that regulated and reinforced social hierarchies and morals through restrictions on clothing, food, and luxury expenditures.\n \n In the Late Middle Ages sumptuary laws were instated as a way for the nobility to cap the conspicuous consumption of the up-and-coming bourgeoisie of medieval cities. ... The danger is that the use of \"carbon offsets\" will create two things that re morally monstrous: a de-facto sumptuary law and the impoverishments of the poor and powerless of this planet. The creation of an aristocratic elite that differentiates itself from the hoi polloi by its ability to buy \"carbon offsets\" while the rest of the planet is forced by environmental laws into a smaller and smaller carbon straightjacket is not so far fetched. \n Read the whole thing.\n \n And then mosey on over to Jim Treacher's house of bloggage The Daily Gut for this:\n \n It's great that he's using solar panels and all that, but notice he's not disputing how huge his electric bill still is. What the hell is he doing in there? Is he a Terminator from the future and requires constant recharging? (That would explain pretty much everything.)\n Hat tip: Tim Blair via Ed Driscoll, both of whom have more good stuff on the Goracle's energy hoggishness.\n \n Updates follow...\n \n Update: The Economist - not exaclty a right-wing rag - calls Gore's response to the Tennessee Center for Policy Research's original report on his huge energy consumption \"flatly silly.\" The piece has an excellent discussion of why \"carbon offsets\" are a shell game that may not actually do anything to help reduce carbon emissions.\n \n Update: Via the blog on the website of carbon offsets marketer TerraPass I found a recent New York Times story that is skeptical of carbon offsets.\n \n Some carbon-offset firms have begun to acknowledge that certain investments like tree-planting may be ineffective, and they are shifting their focus to what they say is reliable activity, like wind turbines, cleaner burning stoves, or buying up credits that otherwise would allow companies to pollute. \n \n Still, as demand for greener living grows, the number of companies jumping into the game has multiplied. At least 60 companies sold offsets worth about $110 million to consumers in Europe and North America in 2006, up from only about a dozen selling offsets worth $6 million in 2004, according to Abyd Karmali of ICF International.Yet another perverse effect, say critics, is that some types of carbon-offset initiatives may actually slow the changes aimed at coping with global warming by prolonging consumers' dependence on oil, coal and gas, and encouraging them to take more short-haul flights and drive bigger cars than they would otherwise have done.\n \n Climate Care, for example, has linked up with Land Rover, a maker of sport utility vehicles, to help the company offset its own emissions. As part of a promotional program, Climate Care also helps purchasers of new Land Rovers offset their first 45,000 miles of driving. \n \n In that way, the program may actually help sell \"larger cars with higher emissions\" and thus contribute more to global warming, according to Mary Taylor, a campaigner with the energy and climate team at Friends of the Earth.\n \n The words \"snake oil\" come to mind...\n \n Too bad that $110 million that well-intentioned but gullible folks spent on \"carbon offsets\" couldn't have been invested in developing hydrogen fuel-cell technology closer to the point that it can replace the internal combustion engine. That's a \"carbon offset\" that actually would make a difference.\n \n Update: A commenter at the TerraPass blog foresaw the Al Gore hypocrisy controversy, posting the following comment on Feb. 20, nearly a week before the Tennessee Center for Policy research put the spotlight on Gore's energy usage:\n \n The criticism [of carbon offsets] is so persistent because everyone likes to rail against perceived hypocrisy - it's easier than engaging the merits of a policy. (The Times article tries to address the merits, in EXTREMELY ANECDOTAL fashion.)\n \n Environmentalists and leftists are somewhat guilty of obsessing over hypocrisy, which provides some of the drumbeat behind the NYT articles. But I guarantee that coverage of carbon \"indulgences\" will get worse if/when Al Gore runs for President, because no-one likes to trump up pseudo-stories about liberal hypocrisy like oil industry-funded libertarian shills and the smear merchants of Fox News. \n \n Um, actually, the environmentalists and the left rushed to defend Gore's hypocrisy, not to attack it. And it was all of the media - the liberal networks as well as Fox - which covered the Gore story.\n \n Post Script: Just for grins I checked my own electric bills to see how many kilowatts of power I use per month on average. The answer: 2,327. At that rate, it would take me nearly eight years of electrical usage to equal what Gore used in one year. In hot August 2006, when Gore's home consumed 22,619 kilowatts of power, my home consumed 4,090. Of course, his house is thrice as large as mine, and also has a guest house and a heated pool, but, still, he used more than five times the electricity I used. And he doesn't have two little kids who generate mountains of dirty laundry...\n \n FINAL UPDATE: A version of this post is posted at the Ecotality blog, and has been doing big business in comments and discussion. I welcome you to check it out at this link. Here at BillHobbs.com, I also have written a few additional posts subsequent to this one:\n \n www.billhobbs.com/2007/02/more_on_gore.html",

   "What I don't get is that the title talks about carbon credits, presumably the system by which companies buy the right to emit certain amounts of CO2, yet the articles are about carbon offsets, a private system whereby a company charges people for the cost of building systems that supposedly reduce carbon elsewhere so that the buyer doesn't have to bother altering their own usage. The carbon trading scheme is a means by which savings in CO2 can be made in the most cost-efficient manner. It's not working properly yet but the principle is sound. Carbon offsets are a lot more fishy, I agree, as it's not clear how you measure carbon not emitted, which is what the calculations are based on.",

Why do you consider me pointing out that Gore is an insincere scam artist who is actually profiting from the fear he's creating with his Global Warming scheme to be bashing him when it is simply exposing him for what he is ? \n \n Emissions trading\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n (Redirected from Carbon emissions trading)\n Emissions trading (or cap and trade) is an administrative approach used to control pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of pollutants.[1]\n In such a plan, a central authority (usually a government agency) sets a limit or cap on the amount of a pollutant that can be emitted. Companies or other groups that emit the pollutant are given credits or allowances which represent the right to emit a specific amount. The total amount of credits cannot exceed the cap, limiting total emissions to that level. Companies that pollute beyond their allowances must buy credits from those who pollute less than their allowances or face heavily penalties. This transfer is referred to as a trade. In effect, the buyer is being fined for polluting, while the seller is being rewarded for having reduced emissions. The more firms that need to buy credits, the higher the price of credits becomes -- which makes reducing emissions cost-effective in comparison. Thus companies that can easily reduce emissions will do so and those for which it is harder will buy credits which reduces greenhouse gasses at the lowest possible cost to society.\n There are currently several trading systems in place with the largest being the European Union's. The carbon market makes up the bulk of these and is growing in popularity. Many businesses have welcome emissions trading as the best way to fight global warming. Enforcement of the caps is a problem, but unlike traditional regulation, emissions trading markets can be easier to enforce because the government overseeing the market does not need to regulate specific practices of each pollution source. However, monitoring (or estimating) of actual emissions is still required, which can be costly. Critics doubt whether these trading schemes can work as there may be too many credits given by the government, such as in the European Union. Once a large surplus was discovered the price for credits bottomed out and the scheme effectively collapsed, with no noticeable reduction of emissions, and few purchases or trades of credits.[2]",

My point is still the same: You have absolutely no fracking idea how credit markets works.\n \n \nSo to repeat you\n\n \n That only works when it is accurate of the person you're addressing it to. I've mentioned the sulfur market and you are again deliberately ignoring it. My discussion is geared around how such credit markets work. You are intently keeping it on how Gore is allegedly is bad. When asked to show you understand these markets you fail to even recognize that someone asked you such a question. Therefore you are here only to bash Gore. I don't actually mind that, what I mind is your ignorance in calling credit markets which DO work contrary to your tiny amount of knowledge that is surpassed by most 5 year olds as ineffective. \n \n \nAnd they only reason they work at all in big industry is because Corporations hate to pay fines and have found that it's cheaper in the long run to invest their capital in scrubbers and purifiers that prevent future fines than to pay fines that take away from corporate profits while giving nothing positive back to the shareholders.\n\n \n And Jito is correct: you don't understand.\n \n Credit markets work by creating incentives to lower emissions. Most dirty industries get most of the credits they want, fines really aren't a problem as long as there are credits to be bought. However, the aggregate credits are slowly decreasing and more emission producers enter the market. The company that can reduce their emissions while still receiving these credits can turn around and sell these credits for virtually pure profit. Furthermore they get to tout their green credentials which has been shown to be rather profitable with the right marketing not to mention the utility reductions. So we have increasing bottom lines for those who innovate and reduce as well as having secondary income source that is virtually management free. Those who fail to clean up will eventually be forced into buying additional credits while their competitors turn a former cost center into a profit center. Big problem. In the long run as credits decrease and users increase, simple supply and demand will jack the price of emissions up. The company that can utilize this will win. In a sense the gov't has just given companies the ability to produce a second stream of legal income, relatively low maintenance income.",

Gore puts his money where is mouth is and you want everyone to chastise him. Thats kinda nuts.\n\n \n Did you even read the articles rich ? I ask because if you understood what carbon credits are you would understand that they are nothing more than a tool by which the wealthy can alleviate their polluting guilt by buying paper credits that supposedly offset the environmental impact made by their Jet Planes, their 20,000+ sq.ft mansions, their fleet of SUVs and their Globe Hopping as they use the Planet as their personal Playgrounds.\n \n Gore screams about our impact on the environment yet he flies around the World in a private Jet. Hr lives in a Mansion and has multiple SUVs, all no-no's according to how he preaches that we, the greedy Americans should live if we really cared about our World. And then to offset his polluting, he purchases Carbon Credits, off which he makes a personal profit because He owns part of the company.\n \n It is also his agenda to pass laws forcing all Americans, that's you and me rich; to be forced to purchase carbon credits based on our estimated carbon footprint that will be determined by our annual food bill, heating, or fuel oil and gas consumption, the sq.footage of your home, the number and types of cars you drive and the miles you travel each year by plane and auto. A carbon footprint will be determined by these qualifiers and a tax will be charged according to them. \n \n That tax will purchase Carbon Offsets from Gores Company of which He will personally profit, thereby allowing him to continue to travel the World in a Private Jet and utilize his fleet of SUVs as he continues to live in his personal Mansions in various places on Earth. The hypocrisy on his part, and others who demand the common man conserves as they live like irresponsible brats is mind numbing but obviously you can't even deduce that reality. \n \n \nI am sorry Jesus didn't tell you about global warming and the bible doesn't have a single page on the subject.

Compared to 1980 levels, SO2 emissions from power plants have dropped by more than 7 million tons, or about 41 percent.\n * Cut NOx emissions by about 3 million tons from 1990 levels, so that emissions in 2005 were less than half the level anticipated without the program. Other efforts, such as the NOx Budget Trading Program in the eastern United States, also contributed significantly to this reduction.\n * Led to significant cuts in acid deposition, including reductions in sulfate deposition of about 36 percent in some regions of the United States and improvements in environmental indicators, such as fewer acidic lakes.\n * Provided the most complete and accurate emission data ever developed under a federal air pollution control program and made that data available and accessible by using comprehensive electronic data reporting and Web-based tools for agencies, researchers, affected sources, and the public.\n * Served as a leader in delivering e-government, automating administrative processes, reducing paper use, and providing online systems for doing business with EPA.\n * Resulted in nearly 100 percent compliance through rigorous emissions monitoring, allowance tracking, and an automatic, easily understood penalty system for noncompliance. Flexibility in compliance strategies reduced implementation costs.\n \n A 2005 study (PDF) (15pp., 532 K) estimates that in 2010, the Acid Rain Program's annual benefits will be approximately $122 billion (2000$), at an annual cost of about $3 billion - a 40-to-1 benefit-to-cost ratio. \n",

Why? Because global warming stopped ten years ago; it hasn't got warmer since 1998,\" he points out. \"And in fact in the last seven years, there has been a downturn in global temperatures equivalent on average to about [or] very close to one degree Fahrenheit per decade. We're actually in a period ... of global cooling.\"\n \n Monckton contends Gore is now \"panicking\" because he has staked his reputation as a former American VP on \"telling the world that we're all doomed unless we shut down 90 percent of the Western economies.\" He also contends that Gore is the largest \"global-warming profiteer.\"\n \n Gore's group The Alliance for Climate Protection is currently launching a new $300 million ad campaign that demands reforms in environmental law to help reduce the supposed \"climate crisis.\" But Monckton points out that in the U.K., Gore is not allowed to speak in public about his \"green investment company\" because to do so would violate racketeering laws by \"peddling a false prospectus.\" He says that fact came about after a British high court found Gore's movie, An Inconvenient Truth, riddled with errors.\n \n Monckton challenged Gore to an internationally televised debate on climate change last year.\n \n \n \"And Gore did NOT accept the challenge?

   "And here's more regarding Global Cooling over the last 8 years, and future cooling trends according to various sciences. \n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu86HT_RHT3gAeEtXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTBybjFrcjVnBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNARjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAw--/SIG=122t00b6k/EXP=1207279879/**http%3a//icecap.us/images/uploads/TheCooling.pdf\n\n The Cooling \n \n While most climate models predict steady rises in global air temperatures over the \n 21st century, there is abundant evidence suggesting otherwise. Many scientists \n believe that projections from the IPCC and other agencies are unrealistic, and that \n in the next several decades temperatures may level off or even decline. \n \n Below are discussions of potential future trends in several major \"forcing\" \n categories suggesting relatively flat or even negative temperature trends in the \n future. \n \n Ocean temperatures \n \n According to Bratcher and Giese (2002), analysis of ocean surface temperature \n records shows that low frequency changes of tropical Pacific temperature lead \n global surface air temperature changes by about 4 years. Anomalies of tropical \n Pacific surface temperature are in turn preceded by subsurface temperature \n anomalies in the southern tropical Pacific by approximately 7 years. The results \n suggest that much of the decade to decade variations in global air temperature may \n be attributed to tropical Pacific decadal variability, and that subsurface \n temperature anomalies in the southern tropical Pacific can be used as a predictor \n for decadal variations of global surface air temperature. Since the southern tropical \n Pacific temperature shows a distinct cooling over the last 8 years, the possibility \n exists that the warming trend in global surface air temperature observed since the \n late 1970's may soon weaken. \n \n Chavez, et al (2003) reviewed physical and biological fluctuations with periods of \n about 50 years that involves Pacific Ocean conditions. They identified \n multidecadal variations that strongly influence sea and air temperatures, and cite \n evidence that a shift from warm to cool Pacific conditions may already be in \n progress. \n \n DiLorenzo et al (2005) studied long-term changes in the observed temperature and \n salinity along the Southern California coast using a four-dimensional space-time \n analysis of the period 1949-2000. Sea surface temperatures warmed by about \n 1.3\u00b0C between 1950 and 1999, primarily because of large-scale decadal \n fluctuations in surface heat fluxes combined with horizontal advection by the \n mean currents. After 1998 the surface heat fluxes suggest the beginning of a \n period of cooling, consistent with colder observed ocean temperatures. \n \n Lyman et al (2006) reported a net loss of 3.2 (\u00b1 1.1) \u00d7 1022 J of heat from the \n upper ocean between 2003 and 2005, in contrast to assumptions of increased \n ocean heat content due to rising air temperatures. It appears that both the recent \n and previous global cooling events are significant and unlikely to be artifacts of \n inadequate ocean sampling. \n \n Peterson and Schwing (2003) describe a rapid and striking transition in the North \n Pacific in late 1998. Upwelling-favorable winds strengthened over the California \n Current (CC), and winds weakened in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Coastal waters \n of the CC and GOA cooled by several degrees, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation \n (PDO) reversed sign and remained negative through summer 2002. Zooplankton \n biomass in the northern CC doubled and switched from warm to cold water \n species dominance, coho and chinook salmon stocks rebounded, and anchovy and \n osmeriids increased. Persistent changes in atmosphere and upper ocean fields and \n ecosystem structure suggest a climate regime shift has occurred, similar (opposite) \n to shifts observed in 1947 (1925 and 1976). If the 1998 regime shift in the \n northern CC is completely analogous to earlier shifts, then ecosystem structure \n should have changed in the GOA. Recent surveys indicate this ecosystem has \n transformed as well. \n \n According to Freeland et al (2003), subsurface upper ocean waters off Oregon and \n Vancouver Island were about 1 deg C cooler in July 2002 than in July 2001. The \n anomalously cool layer coincides with the permanent halocline which has \n salinities of 32.2 to 33.8, suggesting an invasion of nutrient-rich Subarctic waters. \n The anomalously cool layer lies at 30-150 m. The cool anomaly is likely caused \n by stronger southward flow in the California Current and weaker northward flow \n in the Alaska and Davidson Currents during spring 2002. Other factors may \n include reduced coastal downwelling in late winter and early spring 2002, \n enhanced eastward flow in the Subarctic Current, and enhanced winter mixing \n offshore. \n \n Mullin, et al (2003) studied macrozooplankton in the southern California sector of \n the California Current from 1951 to 1999. Total biovolume increased in 1999 to \n the pre-1975 level, consistent with a possible shift to a new regime. Their results \n are consistent with (i) a change in biovolume of the large zooplankton over the \n sampled period; and (ii) a regime shift in the mid-1970s and, possibly, the late \n 1990s. \n \n Ocean-atmosphere variability \n \n Gedalof and Smith (2001) used a transect of climate sensitive tree ring-width \n chronologies from coastal western North America to obtain a useful proxy index \n of North Pacific ocean-atmosphere variability since 1600 AD. They identified \n intervals of an enhanced interdecadal climate signal in the North Pacific. In the \n context of this record, the step-like climate shift that occurred in 1976-1977 is not \n a unique event, with similar events having occurred frequently during the past 400 \n years. Furthermore, most of the pre-instrumental portion of this record is \n characterized by pronounced interdecadal variability, while the secular portion is \n more strongly interannual in nature. If the 1976-1977 event marks a return to this \n mode of variability there may be significant consequences for natural resources \n management in the North Pacific Sector. \n \n Aerosols \n \n Matsui and Pielke (2006) compared the spatial mean and the spatial gradient of the \n aerosol radiative forcing in comparison with those of well-mixed green-house \n gases (GHG). Although greenhouse gases have a larger forcing than aerosol direct \n possible indirect effects, the aerosol direct and indirect effects have far greater \n \"Normalized Gradient of Radiative Effects\" than greenhouse gases. \n \n According to Br\u00e9on (2006), anthropogenic aerosol emissions may increase cloud \n cover by up to 5%, resulting in a substantial net cooling of Earth's atmosphere. \n \n Kaufman and. Koren (2006) note that pollution and smoke aerosols can either \n increase or decrease the cloud cover. This duality in the effects of aerosols forms \n one of the largest uncertainties in climate research. Using solar measurements \n from Aerosol Robotic Network sites around the globe, they show an increase in \n cloud cover with an increase in the aerosol column concentration and an inverse \n dependence on the aerosol absorption of sunlight. The emerging rule appears to be \n independent of geographical location or aerosol type, thus increasing the \n confidence in the understanding of these aerosol effects on the clouds and climate. \n Preliminary estimates suggest an increase of 5% in cloud cover. \n \n Earth Albedo \n \n Pall\u00e9, et al, 2004 compared earthshine measurements of Earth's reflectance (from \n 1999 through mid-2001) with satellite observations of global cloud properties to \n construct an estimate of Earth's global shortwave reflectance. The analysis \n indicates a steady decrease in Earth's reflectance from 1984 to 2000, with a strong \n climatologically significant drop after 1995. From 2001 to 2003, only earthshine \n data are available, and they indicate a complete reversal of the decline. \n \n Solar changes \n \n Scafetta and West (2006) studied the role of solar forcing on global surface \n temperature since 1900 using a sun-climate coupling model.They estimate that the \n sun contributed as much as 45-50% of the 1900-2000 global warming, and 25- \n 35% of the 1980-2000 global warming. This suggests that the solar impact on \n climate change during the same period is significantly stronger than what some \n theoretical models have predicted. \n \n Usoskin et al (2003) and Usoskin et al (2004) used records of the 10Be \n concentration in polar ice to reconstruct the average sunspot activity level from \n 850 A.D. to the present. The reconstruction shows that the period of high solar \n activity during the last 60 years is unique throughout the past 1150 years. \n \n NASA solar physicist David Hathaway (\"Solar Cycle 25 peaking around 2022 \n could be one of the weakest in centuries.\") has studied large-scale circulation \n within the sun using sunspot information. He described \"The Great Conveyor \n Belt,\" a massive circulating current of hot plasma within the Sun. Researchers \n believe the turning of the belt controls the sunspot cycle, and currently they are \n seeing a slowdown in the conveyor. According to theory and observation, the \n speed of the belt foretells the intensity of sunspot activity ABOUT 20 years in the \n future. A slow belt means lower solar activity; a fast belt means stronger activity. \n \"The slowdown we see now means that Solar Cycle 25, peaking around the year \n 2022, could be one of the weakest in centuries,\" says Hathaway, and therefore \n would usher in a very cold period. \n \"There is no need for the Kyoto Protocol - scientists.\" Astronomers in St. Petersburg \n claim the planet will see a cooler period in the next few decades. Khabibulla \n Abdusamatov, head of space research at the Academic Pulkovo Observatory, reiterated \n his warning of an imminent recurrence of the so-called minor Ice Age, similar to the one \n that was registered in the 17th century. Abdusamatov and his colleagues made their \n prediction based on data of 11-year and 100-year fluctuations in solar activity. They said \n that sun emissions increased in the 20th century and have now reached their peak, \n implying that this period should be followed by a decline in solar activity. Therefore, the \n mean annual temperature should drop in 2012, with an even colder period setting in \n between 2055 and 2060. \n Long Historical Trends \n \n Martrat et al (2004) studied sediment data that indicated trends in western \n Mediterranean sea surface temperatures (SST) over the last 250,000 years. A \n recurring pattern was seen: rapid warming, followed by gradual and then rapid \n coolings, followed again by rapid warmings, and so on. For the Holocene, the \n authors report \"a stable SST trend similar to those in previous interstadial stages, \n tending toward progressively cooler climate conditions.\" Suggested from their \n results is that \"the next bifurcation of the climate system may appear as an \n extremely intense cooling if the future natural climate is going to develop as an \n analog of some of the preceding warm periods.\" \n \n Ruddiman et al (2005) state that human intervention in the climate system over the \n last several thousand years may have affected climate sufficiently to prevent or \n delay the onset of an ice age. They say, \"ice-core evidence from previous \n interglaciations indicates that forcing by orbital-scale changes in solar radiation \n and greenhouse-gas concentrations should have driven earth's climate significantly \n toward glacial conditions during the last several thousand years.\" The reason that \n an ice age has not yet begun is because \"humans intervened in the natural \n operation of the climate system by adding significant amounts of CO2 and CH4 to \n the atmosphere, thereby offsetting most of the natural cooling.\" This \"fortuitously \n [produced] the climatic stability of the last several thousand years.\" The authors \n attributed most of the forcing to deforestation and biomass burning (CO2) and rice \n farming and animal husbandry (CH4). \n \n Conclusion \n \n Prediction of future climate is difficult due to the wide variety of forcings known \n to impact climate - to say nothing of hidden forcings not yet known or understood. \n While greenhouse gas forcings may indeed continue to increase, there appear to be \n many other factors which may serve to minimize or cancel out those effects.",

His findings -- published in October in the Proceedings of the Royal Society -- the mathematical, physical sciences and engineering journal of the Royal Society of London -- are now in, and they don't point to us. The sun and the stars could explain most if not all of the warming this century, and he has laboratory results to demonstrate it. Dr. Svensmark's study had its origins in 1996, when he and a colleague presented findings at a scientific conference indicating that changes in the sun's magnetic field -- quite apart from greenhouse gases -- could be related to the recent rise in global temperatures. The chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change, the chief agency investigating global warming, then castigated them in the press, saying, \"I find the move from this pair scientifically extremely naive and irresponsible.\" Others accused them of denouncing the greenhouse theory, something they had not done.\n \n Svensmark and his colleague had arrived at their theory after examining data that showed a surprisingly strong correlation between cosmic rays --highspeed atomic particles originating in exploded stars in the Milky Way -- and low-altitude clouds. Earth's cloud cover increased when the intensity of cosmic rays grew and decreased when the intensity declined.\n \n Low-altitude clouds are significant because they especially shield the Earth from the sun to keep us cool. Low cloud cover can vary by 2% in five years, affecting the Earth's surface by as much as 1.2 watts per square metre during that same period. \"That figure can be compared with about 1.4 watts per square metre estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for the greenhouse effect of all the increase in carbon dioxide in the air since the Industrial Revolution,\" Dr. Svensmark explained.\n \n The Danish scientists put together several well-established scientific phenomena to arrive at their novel 1996 theory. The sun's magnetic field deflects some of the cosmic rays that penetrate the Earth's atmosphere, and in so doing it also limits the immense amounts of ions and free electrons that the cosmic rays produce. But something had changed in the 20th century: The sun's magnetic field more than doubled in strength, deflecting an extraordinary number of rays. Could the diminution of cosmic rays this century have limited the formation of clouds, making the Earth warmer?\n \n That was a plausible theory. But exactly how cosmic rays might create clouds was a mystery -- an unprovable theory, many said. Some even claimed that it was inconceivable for cosmic rays to influence cloud cover.\n \n To discover a mechanism, a team at the Danish National Space Center assembled by Dr. Svensmark undertook an elaborate laboratory experiment in a reaction chamber the size of a small room. The team duplicated the chemistry of the lower atmosphere by injecting the gases found there in the same proportions, and adding ultraviolet rays to mimic the actions of the sun.\n \n What they found left them agape: A vast number of floating microscopic droplets soon filled the reaction chamber. These were ultra-small clusters of sulphuric acid and water molecules -- the building blocks for cloud condensation nuclei-- that had been catalyzed by the electrons released by cosmic rays.\n \n There's more at the link:\n \n Henrik Svensmark http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=fee9a01f-3627-4b01-9222-bf60aa332f1f",

   "And here is some more direct refutations of Gores specific claims.\n \n http://www.webcommentary.com/asp/ShowArticle.asp?id=websterb&date=070416\n More Inconvenient Science on Global Warming \n Al Gore's Hypothesis Debunked\n Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth and his hypothesis about anthropogenic CO2 take a real beating from an examination of climate change history. The belief that humans burning fossil fuels create additional CO2 that is significantly warming the planet with disasterous consequences is completely debunked by real scientific analysis of climate change data and the role that CO2 and other greenhouse gases actually play in climate change.\n Those who have watched and believed An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore's film touting the hypothesis that anthropogenic CO2 is causing climate change, are probably of the following two opinions:\n \n Climate change is strongly influenced by changes in the greenhouse gas CO2.\n \n There is a 600,000-year record showing that when CO2 changes, climate changes (when CO2 goes up, global temperature rises; when CO2 goes down, global temperature decreases).\n A few inconvenient scientific facts about Gore's hypothesis:\n \n CO2 and the greenhouse effect as a climate change force.\n \n Scientific data have historically demonstrated the weak role atmospheric CO2 plays in the greenhouse effect, as well as the weak role of the greenhouse effect in climate change. Al Gore believes the politically-inspired summary reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN-created political group composed of a few subject-matter experts in the field of climatology together with other scientists in fields affected by climate change plus a host of politically-motivated panelists. That was Gore's first mistake. His second was believing he was a climatologist.\n \n What follows are the inconvenient facts about greenhouse warming and CO2 that Al Gore evidently failed to consider:\n \n Water vapor is responsible for up to 95% of greenhouse warming (more at tropics, less at poles).\n \n Greenhouse warming is not a strong climate change force.\n \n After water vapor, CO2 is just one of the remaining minor greenhouse gases.\n \n At the tropics, a change of just 5.25% in atmospheric water vapor content is sufficient to overwhelm the effect of all the rest of greenhouse gases combined (which includes CO2).\n \n Anthropogenic CO2 is a small fraction of CO2 that (after water vapor) comprises the minor greenhouse gases, the vast majority of atmospheric CO2 coming from ocean outgassing. \n \n As more CO2 is added to the atmosphere from whatever source, it has less and less of a greenhouse contribution (just like putting on more blankets will have diminishing returns warming you on a cold evening). \n \n The paleoclimatological record over 500 million years shows that atmospheric CO2 concentration is not correlated with climate. The same can be said of the record during the past 100 years when CO2 consistently rose while global temperature experienced both warming and cooling periods over many decades. In fact, during one of the worst and most prolonged ice eras in Earth's climate history (about 450 million years ago), CO2 concentration was an order of magnitude higher than what it is today (about 15 times higher)!\n \n Gore's misunderstanding of the 600,000-year record of climate change and changes in atmospheric CO2.\n \n Claiming in his film that it is too \"complicated\", Gore fails to understand the correlation between atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change over a 600,000-year ice core record. Gore presents a large chart that appears to show atmospheric CO2 and global temperature moving in lockstep together over that long time period. Trouble is, when the data were examined in detail, the change in atmospheric concentration of CO2 lags temperature change by about 800 years! Oops!\n \n In mathematics, one of the first things taught about testing a theory is that if you can find a single contradictory example, the theory fails. In the case of the CO2-temperature link, the theory that CO2 produces climate (temperature) change fails over a 600,000 year record! (To disprove the Gore claim, it need fail over only a short span of that record.)\n \n Further pursuit of the soundness of a theory requires that, if there are no contradictory examples, then in order for a theory to be accepted, it needs to be explained. Gore offers the explanation that temperature changes in response to CO2 concentration because of the greenhouse effect (which demonstrates how little he understands of the greenhouse effect), but he offers no explanation for why the CO2 would increase and decrease so dramatically in the first place! His current explanation (the \"Industrial Age\") is hardly applicable over the 600,000-year record he cites. \n \n However, the opposing theory (confirmed by the data record) that CO2 responds to changes in temperature (climate) can be readily explained over that period, as can the reason why the temperature changes in the first place!\n \n Here is the climate change record and the climate change science:\n \n Temperature changes in response to solar activity cycles. The greater the solar activity, the warmer the climate; the lesser the solar activity, the colder the climate.\n \n The relationship between solar activity and climate is due to the following \"cosmic connection\" dynamics:\n a) increased solar output increases the heat potential at Earth (duh!), though this in itself is insufficient to account for the magnitude of heat gain observed.\n \n b) increased solar output also increases the \"solar wind\" that deflects a significant portion of cosmic radiation (neutrons & protons constantly bombarding the planet).\n \n c) cloud formation is directly linked to cosmic radiation; the more cosmic radiation, the more cloud formation (as water vapor molecules interact with the shower of particles formed when cosmic radiation impacts the upper atmosphere).\n \n d) reduced cosmic radiation (from greater solar wind due to greater solar activity) yields fewer clouds and allows more of the higher solar output to reach the Earth's surface, particularly the oceans, warming it more. This is a good example of positive feedback. The more potential heating, the fewer the clouds to reflect heat away. Greater cosmic radiation due to lesser solar wind/activity yields more clouds which reflect more of the reduced solar activity into space, thus preventing the oceans and land masses from warming as much (thereby producing relative cooling). This is a good example of negative feedback. Lesser potential heating (due to lower solar activity) allows more cosmic radiation to form more clouds, thus the diminished potential heat is reduced further as a consequence of clouds reflecting sunlight into space.\n Over both long term (going back hundreds of thousands and hundreds of millions of years) and the short term (100 year record up to tens of thousands of years), the record of solar activity and climate change shows a strong correlation. On the other hand, CO2 and climate change are shown to be uncorrelated over any meaningful historic time frame.\n \n As climate warms, the oceans (covering 70% of the Earth) absorb more heat, thus allowing them to release more CO2. As the single largest producers of annual atmospheric CO2, the oceans dwarf other natural CO2 producing processes, which, in turn, dwarf the anthropogenic annual CO2 output. As climate cools, the opposite effect is in play (colder oceans release less gas, therefore, they contribute less to atmospheric CO2).\n \n The lag is due to the slow responsiveness of the enormous volume of the oceans. Just as a large pot of cold water put on the range will not heat to boiling instantly, the oceans take some time to heat up sufficiently to release greater amounts of CO2. Just as a boiling pot of water takes some time to cool when it is removed from the source of heat, the warmed oceans will continue to release CO2 for some considerable time after the climate has begun to cool.\n So, in the one case, we have a rational, cogent, scientifically rigorous explanation for the climate-CO2 link that demonstrates changes in atmospheric CO2 are the result of climate change, and not the cause of it.\n In the other case, we have a politician with no training in the sciences of climate, paleoclimatology, or climate change, who can offer no explanation for clear scientific data that flies in the face of his theory that atmospheric CO2 causes climate change.\n \n Which would you believe?\n \n Given this evidence, are you still prepared to believe the Al Gore theory of climate change?\n \n Bob Webster \n Editor, Publisher, WEBCommentary\n So as you can plainly see, Sun spots and Solar winds aren't the only causes for what is happening, but play a vital role as part of the equation. The problem isn't nearly as simple as Algore would like to make it seem by blaming humans as the major reason for this issue.",

Here's the opinion of GBs Energy Secretary under Maggie Thatcher regarding this issue. I think he defines it very well.\n \n http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=557374&in_page_id=1770 Here's an excerpt:\n Genuine climate scientists admit that Earth's climate is determined by hugely complex systems, and reliable prediction is impossible.\n \n That does not mean, of course, that we know nothing. We know that the planet is made habitable only thanks to the warmth we receive from the rays of the sun. Most of this heat bounces back into space; but some of it is\n \n trapped by the so-called greenhouse gases which exist in the Earth's atmosphere. If it were not for that, our planet would be far too cold for man to survive.\n \n The most important greenhouse gas is water vapour, including water suspended in clouds. Rather a long way behind, the second most important is carbon dioxide.\n \n The vast bulk of the carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is natural - that is, nothing to do with man. But there is no doubt that ever since the Industrial Revolution in the latter part of the 19th century, man has added greatly to atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide by burning carbon - first in the form of coal, and subsequently in the form of oil and gas, too.\n \n So it is reasonable to suppose that, other things being equal, this will have warmed the planet, and that further man-made carbon dioxide emissions will warm it still further.\n \n But in the first place, other things are very far from equal. And in the second place, even if they were, there is no agreement among reputable climate scientists over how much this contributed to the modest late-20th century warming of the planet, and thus may be expected to do so in future. \n \n It is striking that during the 21st century, carbon dioxide emissions have been growing faster than ever - thanks in particular to the rapid growth of the Chinese economy - yet there has been no further global warming at all.\n \n Carbon dioxide, like water vapour and oxygen, is not only completely harmless but is an essential element in our life support system.\n \n Not only do we exhale carbon dioxide every time we breathe (indeed, an important cause of the increased amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is simply the huge increase in the world's population), but plants need to absorb carbon dioxide in order to survive. Without carbon dioxide, there would be no plant life on the planet. And without plant life, there would be no human life either.\n \n While climate scientists disagree about how much further warming continued carbon dioxide emissions might cause, there is an established majority view.\n \n This is articulated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an offshoot of the United Nations, whose view is that 'most' of the modest (0.5 per cent) late-20th century warming was \"very likely\" caused by man-made carbon dioxide emissions.\n \n And if the growth of such emissions continues unabated, their 'best guess' is that in 100 years' time, the planet will be somewhere between 1.8 and 4 per cent warmer than it is today, with a mid-point of a shade under 3 per cent. (Incidentally, this was published before the early 21st century warming standstill was officially acknowledged, so was not taken into account.)\n \n Alistair Darling told us in his recent Budget speech that this would have \"catastrophic economic and social consequences\". But that is just alarmist poppycock.\n \n Let's look at just two of the alleged \"catastrophic\" consequences of global warming: the threat to food production, leading to mass starvation; and the threat to human health, leading to disease and death.\n \n So far as food production is concerned, it is not clear why a warmer climate would be a problem at all. Even the IPCC concedes that for a warming of anything up to 3 per cent, \"globally, the potential for food production is projected to increase\". Yes: increase.\n \n As to health, in its most recent report, the IPCC found only one outcome which they ranked as \"virtually certain\" to happen - and that was \"reduced human mortality from decreased cold exposure\".\n \n This echoes a study done by our own Department of Health which predicted that by the 2050s, the UK would suffer an increase in heat-related deaths by 2,000 a year, and a decrease in cold-related mortality of 20,000 deaths a year - something that ministers have been curiously silent about.\n \n The IPCC systematically exaggerates the likely adverse effects of any warming that might occur because estimates of the likely impact of the global warming it projects for the next 100 years are explicitly based on two assumptions, both of them absurd.\n \n The first is that while the developed world can adapt to warming, the developing world cannot.\n \n The second is that even in the developed world, the capacity to adapt is constrained by the limits of existing technology. In other words, there will be no technological development over the next 100 years.\n \n So far as the first of these two assumptions is concerned, if necessary, the developed world will focus its overseas aid on ensuring that the developing countries acquire the required ability to adapt. The second is, of course, ludicrous - notably in the case of food production, where, with the development of bio-engineering and genetic modification, the world is currently in the early stages of a genuine revolution in agricultural technology.\n \n All in all, given that global warming produces benefits as well as costs, it is far from clear that the currently projected warming, far from being \"catastrophic\", will do any net harm at all.",

There are people who seriously believe the Earth is flat. However, there are also people on this site who do not. \n \n Q: \"Why do you guys believe the Earth is flat?\"\n \n A: Well, it looks that way up close. Also, Samuel Rowbotham et al. performed a variety of experiments over a period of several years that show it must be flat. They are all explained in his book, which is linked at the top of this article.\n \n \n Government\n \n \n Q: \"Why do the all the world Governments say the Earth is round?\" \n \n A: It's a conspiracy\n \n Q: \"What about NASA? Don't they have photos to prove that the Earth is round?\" \n \n A: NASA is part of the conspiracy too. The photos are faked.\n \n Q: \"Why has no-one taken a photo of the Earth that proves it is flat?\" \n \n A: The government prevents people from getting close enough to the Ice Wall to take a picture.\n \n Q: \"How did NASA create these images with the computer technology available at the time?\" \n \n A: Since NASA did not send rockets into space, they instead spent the money on developing advanced computers and imaging software instead \n \n PLEASE NOTE This means that pictures confirming the roundness or flatness of the Earth DO NOT IN THEMSELVES CONSTITUTE VALID PROOF\n \n Q: \"What is the motive behind this conspiracy?\" \n \n A: The motive is unknown although it is probably money\n \n Q: \"If you're not sure about the motive, why do you say there is a conspiracy?\"\n \n A: Well it's quite simple really; if the earth is in fact flat, then the governments must be lying when they say it isn't.\n \n Q: \"The government could not pull off the conspiracy successfully\"\n \n A: Actually, they could.\n \n Q: \"How are the world governments organized enough to carry out this conspiracy?\" \n \n A: They only appear to be disorganized to make the conspiracy seem implausible. \n \n Q: Why hasn't this site been shut down by the government? \n \n A: Doing so would prove that the government is hiding something.\n \n Q: No way could the government possibly guard the entire Ice Wall! It would take too many men! Millions of men!\n \n A: Not really. You could do it with a few hundred and some basic equipment.\n \n Q: Why is NASA's space shuttle runway curved?\n \n A: It was specially constructed by NASA to be so. After all NASA are at the heart of the conspiracy.\n \n The Earth in space \n \n \n Q: \"What is the circumference and diameter of the Earth?\" \n \n A: \"Circumference: 78225 miles, Diameter: 24,900 miles \n \n Q: \"What about the stars, sun and moon and other planets? Are they flat too? What are they made of?\" \n \n A: The sun and moon, each 32 miles in diameter, circle Earth at a height of 3000 miles at its equator, located midway between the North Pole and the ice wall. Each functions similar to a \"spotlight,\" with the sun radiating \"hot light,\" the moon \"cold light.\" As they are spotlights, they only give light out over a certain are which explains why some parts of the Earth are dark when others are light. Their apparent rising and setting are caused by optical illusions. \n \n In the \"accelerating upwards\" model, the stars, sun and moon are also accelerating upwards. \n \n The stars are about as far as San Francisco is from Boston. (3100 miles)\n \n Q: \"Please explain sunrises/sunsets.\"\n \n A: It's a perspective effect. Really, the sun is just getting farther away; it looks like it disappears because everything gets smaller and eventually disappears as it gets farther away.\n \n Q: \"Why are other celestial bodies round but not the Earth?\" \n \n A: The Earth is not one of the other planets. The Earth is special and unlike the other bodies in numerous ways.\n \n Q: \"What about satellites? How do they orbit the Earth?\" \n \n A: Since sustained spaceflight is not possible, satellites can't orbit the Earth. The signals we supposedly receive from them are either broadcast from towers or any number of possible pseudolites.\n \n Q: \"What's underneath the Earth?\" aka \"What's on the bottom?\" aka \"What's on the other side?\"\n \n A: This is unknown. Some believe it to be just rocks, others believe the Earth rests on the back of four elephants and a turtle. \n \n Q: \"What about gravity?\" \n \n A: The Earth is accelerating upwards at 1g (9.8m/s^2) along with every star, sun and moon in the universe. This produces the same effect as gravity. \n \n Q: \"Isn't this version of gravity flawed? Wouldn't planes/helicopters/paragliders crash into the Earth as the Earth rises up to them?\" \n \n A: No. By the same argument, we could ask why planes/helicopters/paragliders don't crash into the Earth as they accelerate down towards them. The reason that planes do not crash is that their wings produce lift, which, when the rate of acceleration upwards equals that of gravity's pull downwards, causes them to remain at a constant altitude. \n \n The same thing happens if the Earth is moving up. The plane is accelerating upwards at the same rate as the Earth, which means the distance between them does not change. Therefore, the plane stays at the same height and does not crash. \n \n Q: \"Doesn't this mean we'd be traveling faster than the speed of light, which is impossible?\" \n \n A: The equations of Special Relativity prevent an object from accelerating to the speed of light. Due to this restriction, these equations prove that an object can accelerate at a constant rate forever, and never reach the speed of light. For an in depth explanation: Click here.\n \n Q: \"If the world was really flat, what would happen if you jump off the disc's edge?\" \n \n A: You would enter an inertial reference frame, moving at a constant velocity in the direction the Earth was moving before you jumped. The Earth would continue accelerating upwards past you at a rate of 1g, so it would appear to you that you were falling into space. \n \n Q: \"If the Earth was indeed a flat disc, wouldn't the whole planet crunch up into itself and eventually transform into a ball?\" \n \n A1: If the Earth generated a gravitational field, yes, it would eventually happen, after a billion years maybe. FE assumes that the Earth does not generate a gravitational field. What we know as 'gravity' is provided by the acceleration of the earth. \n \n A2: There is a counter-mass which pulls the Earth back into a disc shape.\n \n Q: \"Why does gravity vary with altitude?\" \n \n A: The moon and stars have a slight gravitational pull.\n \n Q: Follow-up to previous question: How is it that the Earth does not have a gravitational pull, but stars and the moon do?\n \n A: This argument is a non sequitur. You might as well ask, \"How is it that snakes do not have legs, but dogs and cats do?\" Snakes are not dogs or cats. The Earth is not a star or the moon. It doesn't follow that each must have exactly the properties of the others, and no more.\n \n Geography\n \n Q: Do you have a map?\n \n A: See this one, created by one of our members. There is also this map attributed to a person named Wilbur Voliva, and another by Heinrich Scherer. \n Also, there is Cosmas Indicopleustes' world picture, 6 th century in the Christian Topography.\n \n Q: Exactly what shape is the Earth if it's flat? Square or circle? \n \n A: Circle, like in the UN logo, however, the earth is NOT 2D, it is in the shape of a cylinder.\n \n Q: \"Why doesn't water run off the Earth?\" \n \n A: There is a vast ice wall that keeps the water where it is. The ice wall is roughly 150ft high. This also explains why you can find a vast plane of ice when you travel south.\n \n Antarctica as a continent does not exist.\n \n Q: \"How does global warming affect the ice wall?\" \n \n A1: The Ice Wall is really a mountain range. It just happens to be covered in ice and snow.\n \n A2: Global Warming doesn't happen. It and its counter-theory (Global Cooling) are effects that cancel each other out. Remember, these \"greenhouse gasses\" can reflect heat back out into space as well as keep it on Earth. Yes, there are recorded rises in temperature, but the only records we have go back, at most, around 150 years. This is very likely an occurrence that happens every [x<150] years, that's happened before (perhaps many times), and that the Earth has thus survived before. \n \n Q: \"What about tides?\" \n \n A: The tides exist due to a slight see-saw effect on the earth. As it goes back and forth, the water rushes to the side that is lower. Note, this is a very slight wobble. Remember, these wobbles are created by very minor earthquakes. They keep the tides in check. Notice that large earthquakes result in large tides or \"tsunami\". \n \n Q : \"Why is the North pole colder than the equator?\" \n \n A: The sun circles over the equator, thus the poles don't receive the same intensity of light.\n \n Q: \"How do volcanic eruptions happen?\" \n \n A: The Earth is thick enough to have a core of molten lava. Once there's too much of it in too confined a space, it finds its way out, just like the water will come out of a full bottle if you squeeze it too hard \n \n Q: \"What about time zones?\" \n \n A: The sun is a spotlight which shines light on a concentrated area, so not everywhere on Earth will be lit at once. Times zones exist so that everyone's clock will be at 12:00 around the time the sun is approximately directly overhead. \n \n Q: \"What about Lunar Eclipses\" \n \n (Possible A) The moon isn't a spotlight; it glows with light from the sun, reflected off the Earth. Different parts of the Earth are more reflective than others (the seas, the polar cap, the ice wall, for example). Sometimes, the position of the sun (which is a spotlight) means that only very low-reflective or non-reflective parts of the Earth's surface are illuminated, so the moon is abnormally dark. This could potentially explain lunar phases as well. \n \n Q: \"How come the travel time by air from South America to New Zealand, via the polar route, is SHORTER than the travel time going North first and then South again?\" \n \n A: (Presumed answer: The airline pilots are misled by their GPS, or are deliberately conspiring to make it appear that the flights take different times) \n \n Q: \"How can a compass work on a Flat Earth?\"\n \n A: The magnetic field is generated in the same fashion as with the RE. Thus, the magnetic south pole is near the geographic north pole, just like on the RE. The magnetic north pole is on the underside of the Earth. The Ice Wall is not the south pole, but acts as it, as it is the furthest from the center of the earth that you can follow the magnetic field. The field is vertical in this area, accounting for the aurora australis.\n \n Q: \"When traveling in a straight direction, you will always reach the same point on the globe from where you started. How can this happen if the world is flat?\" \n \n A: You need to have evidence for this to be true. Also, define \"straight.\" Remember, the northern point on the compass is, under most circumstances (unless near the centre or deep in the ice wall), pointing toward the centre of the Earth. Therefore, if you follow your compass due east or due west, ending up at the same point you started from, you've just gone around the world in a circle. \n \n Q: If you go directly south won't you eventually fall off the edge of the Earth? \n \n A: Yes, you will. In order to use this fact as proof you need to record a video of someone flying directly south around the world without falling off the edge. Furthermore you need to prove that your navigational equipment allows you to travel directly south without deviating.\n \n Q: How come when I flush my toilet in the northern hemisphere it goes counterclockwise but I have this friend in Australia and when he flushes it goes clockwise?\n \n You're mistaken. On a round Earth, the Coriolis effect adds at most one (counter)clockwise rotation per day; fewer as you get closer to the equator. The water in your toilet/sink/bathtub/funnel spins much faster than that (probably at least once per minute, or 1440 times per day) so the additional/lost rotation from the Coriolis effect wouldn't be noticed.\n \n Q: How do seasons work?\n \n The radius of the sun's orbit around the Earth's axis symmetry varies throughout the year, being smallest when summer is in the northern annulus and largest when it is summer in the southern annulus.\n ",

Adding one mole of hydrochloric acid to one mole of sodium hydroxide at 20\u00b0C will yield one mole of sodium chloride. Adding one mole of hydrochloric acid to one mole of sodium hydroxide at 25\u00b0C will still yield one mole of sodium chloride. If my thermometer is inaccurate and reads 25.0\u00b0C when the temperature is 24.9\u00b0C, my results aren't changed.\n Now, I'm not claiming that errors in variables can't affect results. It depends on which variables are coming into play; I don't need to know the permittivity of free space when carrying out the above reaction, so any uncertainty in the permittivity of free space has no effect on my experiment's results. But Archie's main claims it that \"there may be unknown variables,\" therefore we must take with all of our conclusions a healthy pinch of salt (i.e. we don't know everything, therefore we don't know anything). This is asinine. Even if we presume that our models are flawed, they are still effective and largely accurate.\n Also notice that Archie doesn't seem to give a flip about uncertainty about gravity or temperature but only about things that he thinks might affect the scientific disciplines and topics that he objects to, like developmental biology and cosmology. It's this kind of special pleading hackery that exposes him for the double-speaking anti-intellectual we've all come to know and love.\n \n \nIf a reproducible scientific calculation is run and rerun in order to determine a specific outcome, and if the wrong numbers are used every time the calculation is run; would the right answer ever result no matter how many times the experiment was run? I think not\n\n But is there any reason to think that the wrong numbers are being used? When those numbers accurately describe previously confirmed data, then we can apply those numbers to other data and draw conclusions about the observations. It's quite simple. It's rather similar to knowing that an object you drop tomorrow will fall with an acceleration of g (ignoring air resistance) even though it hasn't happened yet, because we know that dropping an object at any time has resulted in that object's downward acceleration of g. If you don't believe in this logic, then go walk off a cliff and post the video of your levitation.\n \n \nYou've defended nothing. All you've done is denied the truth about your sleazy tactics. And thanks for posting these examples again of how you twisted my clear evidence with those links.\n\n Just like I \"twisted\" your words to say exactly what you said? Right... emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nLet people go back and reread it in context and they'll see what I mean.\n\n Yes, everybody, please do.\n \n \nAnd do you think that gazza elliott is some savior of rationality. He loses all credibility with me if he agrees with anything you say. [bold added]\n\n Ah, so you admit basing your conclusions upon your bias instead of upon the points being made. I cited Gazza as an example of an outsider who did read it in context, and he made it very clear that your statements above are bunk: I wasn't twisting your words, I didn't need any help, and you were getting your butt reamed. Now, if you'd like to continue forwarding arguments that have already been countered -- and doing it in a way that effectively shoots yourself in the foot -- I'm sure as hell not going to stop you.\n \n \nYou act like the predictions of charlatans has any value at all in reality.\n\n It does. See The Case of Baby Fae. Or is it that you care about fetuses in the womb but not young children in need of heart transplants because they counter your argument?\n \n \nIf I predict that a new War will arise between 2 Third World Countries in the next 3 years am I a Prophet? Or just stating the probable obvious?\n\n Please explain why the existence of shared pseudogenes is a \"probable obvious\" based on the creation model.\n \n \nYou mean that evolution implies that many features of modern organisms reflect the structure of their ancestors in ways that are not adaptive. Again, nothing about that conflicts with my reality as a Creationist.\n\n And nothing about that conflicts with Bobby's reality of Flying Spaghetti Monsterism, either.\n \n \nAssume that God created every life form within 25,000 years ago and none of your evidence proves evo at all.\n\n You're saying, assume that you are right and that I have no evidence. You mean to pretend that I'm in your shoes? Well, I could, but I'd feel really dumb.\n \n \nAnd look how you pompously claim to understand genetics while insisting that I don't, only to make assumptions that prove nothing in reality.\n\n What assumptions? I'm still waiting for your genetics-based explanation for why shared pseudogenes are predicted by genetics in the creationist model.\n \n \nSorry, my bad. You've not called me a liar in one response to me since being here.\n\n I've not called you a liar in several responses. Ironically, your now trying to say that the number is only one means that you are... yeah, you got it. Good show.\n \n \nNo I didn't. I said to suggest topics and I would consider them. But you should know that a one on one with moderation isn't considered an informal debate.\n\n And I suggested discussing shared pseudogenes. You started discussing it here without moderation. And no, there's a Challenger's Corner on this board that is specifically for informal debates with moderators holding the participants at a higher standard.",
