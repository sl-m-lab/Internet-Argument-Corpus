   "Georgian dictator understands fully well that in case of his overthrow it will go hard with him in spite of his dalliance with Washington. The problem is in funds that Saakashvili used for his own purpose, the funds stolen by Georgian elite, the funds that didn't come to be used in Georgian economy and for people's sake. Sooner or later American justice could get added to that of Georgian! I'm sure that American tax payers will never let him go with it! \n In this connection Saakashvili prepares his own lines of retreat. And some outcast states could become a shelter for Georgian president. It will be Iran I think - Saakashvili looks to be trying to get some close ties with the main US enemy!",
