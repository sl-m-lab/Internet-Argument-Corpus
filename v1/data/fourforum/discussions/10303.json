I think evangelical is very hard to define. IMO it has to do with a belief that the gospel is a central part of Christian life.

If you consider yourself one of these, do you think that your sect/denomination/point of view is the only true Christianity and then what does that mean in terms of eternal salvation etc.?\n\n \n Like political commentary, often such terms have multiple meanings and interchangability.\n \n Fundamentalist would be one who would follow the fundamentals of their faith. However, in common parlance, it can result in meaning rigid and intolerant against anything that it doesn't view as adhearing to that funmentalist interpretations of faith.\n \n Since we deal with Christianity mostly here, a Christian fundamentalist would believe in the triune nature of God embodied in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost/Spirit. The necessity for repentance of defined sins and acceptance of the spilt blood of their Christ, Jesus upon the Cross as atonement for the sins of all mankind and that who ever accepted this would live in heaven. There is a judgement of all man in the future done by Jesus. Nothing other than faith in Christ will get you into heaven.\n There are a few more but, that mostly covers it.\n Some add in others as fundamentals of Christian faith, notably belief in a virgin birth or, in exteme manifestation of signs of tongues as proof of salvation *see also Charismatics later.\n \n A evangelical is any one who seeks to spread their faith to others. For Christians, there are several biblical passages dealing with this. There are also several methods for doing so. Biblically, one should allow the good fruit (deeds) they bear show witness to non-believers of the Christ that dwells within. \n In common parlance, radicallist of the past generation have given way to end-times beliefs and stress an urgency. That, somehow, the above given belief may be too slow...and they really want to save all these souls from the immenent day of judgement that's just around the corner. In zeal, they resort to underhanded tactics and blunt methods to accomplish this.\n Thus, insults, ridicule and coersion can be seen to be used. Dishonest methods would be to infiltrate an establishment such as a nursing home for Jews and proselytise to a captive and weakened audience. Blunt methods would include pushing pro-Your-Sect phamplets upon anyone you think isn't a 'Tru Believa'...even if they are already saved.\n \n As for Pentecostalism.\n It's a fractured belief system with several sub-sects. it originated in 1900 with the Azusa Street revival in CA. \n It's noted for zealous and boisterous praise, near uncontrolled emotionalism, a focus on personal experience and the believe in Charismatic gifts such as tongues*, the laying on of hands for healing and prophecy still being in use today. Cesationists believe the Pentecostal gifts from the book of Acts ended some time back and aren't needed today due to the bible being in print in all languages, the faith being spread by trained missionaries to all peoples and the advent of modern (god gifted) medicines and science. \n Pentecostals initially believed the gibberish they uttered was a foreign language (which according to the ingterpretation of Glossia and usage in the bible it is) but, when they tried to use it to spread their faith, they found others heard only babbling. The founding fathers of the moveemnt, rather than stop the heretical practice, hacked the bible with personal interpretation to make it support their beliefs, comeing to the general belief that there are different types of tongues. A private prayer language, foreign languags and a toungues that can be ingterpreted by someone with the gift of interpretation of tongues.\n As a disjointed and fractured belief system, they have about 500 million followers and are the fastest growing sect of Christianity with gaines made at the expense of Catholicism in Asia, Africa and South America.\n Some pentecostals are oneness, aka 'Jesus Only' and don't believe in the trinity. \n \n \n Charismatics. Most Pentecostals are Charismatics. ie. believing that the gifts in Acts are still in use today. Not all charismatics are Pentecostal though. Protestant and Catholics sects can believe in these too. Notably, in recent times, many Catholic Hispanics give way to charismatic beliefs.\n \n \n \n Examples of some of this.\n Easyrider is a Charismatic Pentecostal as stated in his beliefs and the church he attends.\n Archangel is a Charismatic evangelical protestant due to his stated beliefs and practices.\n \n \n If you're interested in seeing a structured Pentecostal Church, visit any church that is Church of God in Christ. 'COGIC'. \n \n As for Non-denominationals, typically they follow either a loose organization of like minded believers or are the denomination of *pastors name* as it's his interpretations you're going by.\n \n \n \n Hope that helps without too much bias or over load of information.\n I could rant for days on the finer points of the beliefs and practices as well as subsects.",

   "Your first two definitions seem pretty spot on to me. Fundamentalists believe in a strict, literal interpreation of the Bible, and Evangelicals \"spread the good news\". The Pentecostals, as I understand it, emphasize a direct, personal relationship with God, sometimes demonstrated by, as you say, speaking in tongues. They also tend to be a bit more demonstrative in their worship, though that or course may vary from church to church, and isn't strictly part of the definition.",

Like dealing with poverty and engaging in racial equality. The Asuza revival had all sorts of peoples worshiping together which was nearly unheard of in those times.\n They also allow females to lead as pastors quite often (not sure if all sects still do).\n IMO, they can also move and motivate people for a cause.\n Unfortunatly, in some cases today, the cause is the glorification of the self or pastor and financial abuse (among other abuses).\n \n Personally, from my understandings of the bible though, female 'leadership' is prohibited. A woman can do quite a bit such as bear witness and share testimony, but not lead. They definatly can't be the husband of one wife as some leaderships require.\n The bible also states not all receive the same 'gifts' and gifts are handed out as the Holy Spirit sees fit and desires...so, not all are gifted with the evidence of speaking in tongues as Pentecostals believe happens when you are baptized in the Holy Spirit.\n From my experience, many Pentecostals also play loose with some interpretations of the bible...but, in general are fundamentalistic in their approach.\n Some also take an anti-intellectual approach. Focusing on the 'heart' over the 'head'. \n \n What I'd suggest is to watch the recent documentary Jesus Camp.\n They are evangelical (very noticable with the phamplet pushing and protesting) Charismatics (believing in speaking in 'tongues') and fundamentalistic.\n The fact that they are Word of Faith is glossed over and not apparent unless you know what to look for...and even most believers of that movement don't know they are WofF's.\n But, take it with a pinch of salt. It doesn't show everything, hiding some of the worst stuff and also glossing over some of the better things they'd have to offer since the directors really didn't know what they were doing.",
