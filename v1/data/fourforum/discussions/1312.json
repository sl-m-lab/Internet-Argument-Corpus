   "Due to high demand from the pro-life camp, I have come up with a modest proposal regarding abortion and pregnancy. First, lets examine the basic debate over abortion. The pro-choicers would say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body and a woman should be able to control that part of her body. They would also say that a fetus is not a conscious being. But in their infinite wisdom many pro-life people would respond to that by saying, \"it has the potential to become a conscious being.\" \n \n Based on this ingenius idea of potential, I will establish my proposal. Right now all people of both genders have the potential for life, or at least half of it each. Therefore, to be ethically correct, all people should have sex in all of their spare time. This would properly maximize the potential for life, and we know that if we do not utilize this potential to the maximum we are killing people, just as abortion kills people. \n \n In order to enforce this modest proposal on those who will not be morally correct on their own, the pro-choicers, I have come up with a three part plan. First, all birth control methods will be outlawed. Second, the government should administer mandatory pregnancy tests to all women once a month to make sure that they are pregnant. If a woman is not pregnant at the time of the test then she has until the next test to become pregnant. If not she will be electrocuted. Or perhaps a more effective technique, a professional raping squad will be sent out to impregnate her. And third, all people who are sterile will be put in front of the shooting squad immediately because they are completely worthless. \n \n Through this plan, we can crank out as many people as possible, completely overpopulate, destroy the environment, destroy all natural resources in under 5 years, and finally all die. Just consider this modest proposal. \n \n From http://danthewhite.greatnow.com",

The goal isn't to destroy life, but to save life. If the fetus is undesirable, then the person should have thought about not having sex. If she was raped, that's sad, but that doesn't mean she gets to kill her child. The fetus is a human being and therefore has a legal and moral right to life.

I think suicide should be allowed in certain cases, but those are pretty limited. I don't think a 14 year old girl who just got dumped by her first boyfriend should be allowed to do it, but someone who is already dying, whose body is wracked with pain, whose doctors cannot treat that pain for fear of killing them should be able to die.\n I know a man whose father had a severe subdural hemotoma, which left him lying on his kitchen floor for several days before the weekly maid found him there. A few months later he killed himself. He left no note, so we are left to wonder why he did this. Maybe there was another medical event, very common in those cases... maybe he woke up blind, maybe he realized that he was on his way out anyway, and did not want to end up withering in a hospital, using up his children's inheritance on expensive medical treatment that would have only postponed the inevitable. \n I do think he had every right to end his life.\n I myself have decided that if the time comes when I see my end coming, have serious medical ailments, whatever.... i will end it. But not with a nice overdose or gunshot, I will go up to the mountains and offer myself to bear, return to nature.\n And, I think, that is my choice",

   "Due to high demand from the pro-life camp, I have come up with a modest proposal regarding abortion and pregnancy. First, lets examine the basic debate over abortion. The pro-choicers would say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body and a woman should be able to control that part of her body. They would also say that a fetus is not a conscious being. But in their infinite wisdom many pro-life people would respond to that by saying, \"it has the potential to become a conscious being.\" \n \n Based on this ingenius idea of potential, I will establish my proposal. Right now all people of both genders have the potential for life, or at least half of it each. Therefore, to be ethically correct, all people should have sex in all of their spare time. This would properly maximize the potential for life, and we know that if we do not utilize this potential to the maximum we are killing people, just as abortion kills people. \n \n In order to enforce this modest proposal on those who will not be morally correct on their own, the pro-choicers, I have come up with a three part plan. First, all birth control methods will be outlawed. Second, the government should administer mandatory pregnancy tests to all women once a month to make sure that they are pregnant. If a woman is not pregnant at the time of the test then she has until the next test to become pregnant. If not she will be electrocuted. Or perhaps a more effective technique, a professional raping squad will be sent out to impregnate her. And third, all people who are sterile will be put in front of the shooting squad immediately because they are completely worthless. \n \n Through this plan, we can crank out as many people as possible, completely overpopulate, destroy the environment, destroy all natural resources in under 5 years, and finally all die. Just consider this modest proposal. \n \n From http://danthewhite.greatnow.com\n\n \n \n Definition: If the woman wants to keep the child she calls it a baby. If the woman wants to abort a child she calls it a fetus. \n \n I propose that a woman may abort one child and if found pregnant again and wanting an abortion she be sterilized. This would solve all your problems, allow government paid abortion, and eliminate over population. How simple the answers are. You make it much too complex",
