   "Larry Craig received the NRA's highest honor for his role in passing a law that helped to protect the gun industry against lawsuits. He was praised for \"supporting the Second Amendment\" as can be seen in this video:\n http://www.nraila.org//Multimedia/MMPlayer_Set.aspx?ID=75\n \n Whatever. It was probably more about helping the gun industry to maximize profits that anything else. He also had a long history of supporting anti-gay legislation. Now he has resigned from the Senate because he was caught by the police trying to solicit gay sex in a public restroom in the Minneapolis Airport. As I understand, he had been stopping in the Minneapolis Airport while travelling back and forth between between D.C. and Idaho for many years. I suspect he had been successful many times in obtaining what he wanted. Here is a video of Craig chastising Bill Clinton for being a \"nasty, bad, naughty boy\" for having an affair with Monica Lewinsky.\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Vs5570pKw\n \n Looks like the NRA has lost one of its strongest supporters in the Senate. I wonder if he was as sincere in his support of the pro-gun position as in his support of anti-gay legislation. And is he going to resign from the NRA board too?",
