Israel if you can remember pulled out of Gaza to end the turmoil the Palestinians have towards them. But did it work? HELL NO. It is always Israles fault when you have radical facist islamic (no offense) radicals who swear to kill Israel and the US, who bomb school buses, who shoot rockets into civilian houses, who expect to be rewarded by God by killing innocent children and adults, and who will stop at nothing to see Israle raised to the ground come hell or high water. And yet all of you enlightened peoples of peace who obviously have brains the size of your egos sit back on your lazy boys watching CNN and say its all Israles fault. Have you even once considered that Israle may be defending itself? And zionists!? What about the zealots? The ones who hold power in governmet offices in the midle east, ones who openly declare war and death to Israel due to race and religion? Dont you see what is happening? Israel is upon a hill looking out upon a sea of enemies. She is benf choked ans strangled when all her people want is peace and soliutde. And what about Israel bombing Lebanon and Palestine? Their Fing ######! If your city was bombed youd be ###### too! These are acts of defence infused with years of hurt, battle scars, and the bitter taste of tears from slavery, to near annihlation. If youc annot look past your ego's and self absorbed opinions to see that the equality and basic right to life is threatened, you have no buisness calling yourself a debator, or a Patriot, or even human in some regards.",

   "Israel if you can remember pulled out of Gaza to end the turmoil the Palestinians have towards them. But did it work? HELL NO.\n \n Yes but the Gaza Strip is such a small piece of land and seperated from the West Bank. The move was to small to have a real effect on the Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip refugee camp. Only by unification of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to form a Palestinian state has one whole country would it work. Alone and seperated the two refugee camps do not work. Just becasue I say this does not make me anti Israeli or anti semetic - only logical in my approach to the problem.\n \n What is the solution:\n \n You can only set the stage for the solution and let it create peace.\n \n Return all land to rightful countries that are occupied at present by Israel. It is just legally correct and international law. (Chebba Farms and Gollan Heights)\n \n Address the Palestinian problem in its intirity - formation of a state (not just two refugee camps), return of palestinian refugees outside the GS and WB to newly formed Palestine, deal with all Arabic and Israeli prisoners.\n \n Then you can address the problem with extremism in the Middle East and allow the moderates to take control. Has long as you have reasons for the extremists to continue fighting then you will never defeat them. It is a mental battle where you win the hearts and minds of people.",

Hopefully they will be liberated women and will see him for the chauvinist murderer that he is.\n\n \n thank you for posting this......... it is just a sample of what the Muslim terrorists will continue to do to Israelis and to the British and to America",
