   "Two officers were demoted in Israel for shooting a wheelchair bound man at a protest demonstration. Soldiers opened fire when \"it looked as though\" stone throwing Palestinians were trying to infiltrate an Israeli industrial area. Now luckily these IDF soldiers are trained with amazing capabilies and I also hear they are one heck of a shot. \n \n So how is it that a man bounded by wheelchair is shot in the head? Not the knees, arms, or stomach, but in the head. And what was the guy doing that was so wrong? Did he have a bomb? Was he trying to wheel himself at rapid pace into the industrial area? It seems that he wasn't a threat at all and the man was killed in cold blood. \n \n So what happens to the officers? They are demoted??? I'm shocked for two reasons. One that action was taken against these individuals. And shocked that a nation that is regarded as a democracy is allowed to let it soldiers kill a wheelchair bound man by bullet to the head and get away with it. Is it just not murder if a Palestinian is involved. Demoted? Are these people kidding me. Hell maybe if I join the IDF I can use any cripple as target practice and only have the inconvience of having my rank lowered. So again, democracy working at it's most pristine, that's what I love to see.\n \n Remi\n \n http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/440742.html\n http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/5A9A7A0E-2857-415A-9563-8648CDE9D403.htm",

It's hard because things like these never get reported unless they have to (media is around).

   "Jim,\n \n My point was they either intentionally killed the man or they sprayed bullets. The IDF are not exactly bad shots. I find it hard to believe many times the IDF reports. I question it. Maybe it was my fault for driving the notion that the articles said that he was targeted and shot because the artilcles don't do that. The Haaretz article was reporting on info they got from the IDF, the IDF would not exactly portray themselves in a negative light\n \n I also question if the youths were trying to infilitrate an industrial area. The article says stone throwing youths? Where were the rubber bullets, why did a wheel chair bound man die. I think it's odd that a bullet went through a window and luckily nailed the guy right in the head. \n \n Remi",
