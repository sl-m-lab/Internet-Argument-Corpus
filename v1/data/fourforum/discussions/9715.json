   "Who do YOU all think should get this years MVP. A few readings here should tell you that I think it should be.......................\n \n \n MV STEVE! Best assist record in the league, high scorer, his team mates shine when he is on the field. His unselfish play leads to tons of unselfish play by his teammates. The suns are the highest scoring team in the league and they do not have a player in the top ten scorers. That says something. They frequently have six and sometimes seven players in double digit scoring.\n \n So who do you all vote for?",

   "I'm here, but I voted for LeBron (Nash would be my second choice - but he has already won a gajillion times). I just saw LeBron play last week and he may be the best ball player I have seen (live). Although KG is a great ball player and our star I am not sure I would even pick him as MVP for the Wolves this season - I think I may root for Marko Jaric, Ricky Davis or Mark Blount.\n \n By the way - let me take this moment to say that ever since firing Dwayne Casey the Wolves suck suck suck suck suck suck suck suck suck. Stupid Kevin McHale. :xbanghead \n \n Who do you think will win the playoffs this year? I put my money on your Suns or the Mavs.",

I am also betting that whoever wins the west will win the championship.\n \n Huck",

   "After the dallas loss to the suns for the last two straight Steve nash is hands down the winner.\n \n As for Kobe:\n \n Are you kidding me. Look at his play. He is a very selfish player. He scored 28 in the first half last night, but then was held to 11 points for the second half and went 1 for 10 in the fourth quarter. The suns were double and tripple teaming him and he simply would take bad shots instead of getting it to his open guys.\n \n Nash was responsible for as many points (one more in fact if you add 2X assists plus points made) and his team looked better, although they were not at their best.\n \n MV STEVE!!!!!\n \n By the by, Leandro Barbosa was overwhelmingly named 6th man of the year. He is a starter in bench position.\n \n Huck",
