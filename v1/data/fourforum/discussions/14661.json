   "It took a very long time to do, but thanks to the diligence of many people we have achieved a hard won and decisive victory. The Second Amendment, the right to be armed for all legal and lawful reasons, is finally recognized as not just a fundamental right, but an individual right held by the people, not any state or government. And this right is binding, so local, state and federal level government has to recognize and abide by it, just as they would any other right held by the people.\n \n No longer can there be discussions about \"gun rights\", but rather constitutional rights, because that's what they are.\n \n No longer can we be referred to as \"gun nuts\" or \"gun crazies\" for insisting that our rights all be subject to equal recognition and protection, regardless of which right we exercise. After all you'd never find First Amendment advocates being referred to as \"free speech nuts\", or Fourth Amendment advocates being called \"privacy nuts\".\n \n And here's the best part of the victory. No longer can gun control advocates cite isolated examples of individuals with bad behavior while armed, and use that as an example of why firearms have to be further restricted. \n \n Yelling racial slurs isn't sufficient grounds for limiting a person's free speech, preaching Christianity in San Francisco isn't grounds for restricting a person's right to exercise religion, so the occasional XXXXX shooting at people isn't grounds for trying to push firearm restrictions. You don't limit a constitutional right just because criminals might do something bad, when they don't even have said rights in the first place.",

One of these restrictions tends to be not buying any alcoholic beverages. If they do and get caught then it's a violation of their parole and they go right back to prison.\n \n Despite the fact that it's 100% illegal for a felon to purchase or possess a firearm, they still manage to get armed, and we have no way of finding out their sources, or how many sources there are for them to choose from. I believe that in barring them from the legal venues, we've regulated their ability to be tracked beyond our boundaries. The more we're faced with these issues I think it would be easier to remove the prohibition against purchase, and then bust them for the possession in a sting operation. That way we can catch them in the act, just like we would somebody violating their parole by buying a six pack or paying for a hooker.\n \n We know who the criminals are, but we don't know who their dealers are.

You can no longer push mandatory storage or trigger lock requirements, those are unconstitutional on all levels. \n \n You can't push for mandatory training and license requirements, such restrictions have been found unconstitutional with regard to other rights, and thanks to Heller and McDonald the same standard applies to the Second Amendment.\n \n You certainly can't push for bans on so-called \"assault weapons\" because the Supreme Court outright rejected the argument that constitutional protection stops where modern technology starts.\n \n And don't forget the fact that the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment protected our use for firearms for all legal and lawful purposes.

None of the cases Orin cites say anything about the meaning of \"proper.\" They all focus on whether the measure in question was \"necessary\" or not.\n \n In the rare instances where the Court has given separate consideration to the meaning of \"proper,\" the Court has made clear that it is a separate and distinct issue from what is necessary, and that it is not subject to broad judicial deference. For example in Printz v. United States, the Court concluded that a federal law requiring state officials to perform background checks on gun purchasers was \"improper\" because it invaded state sovereignty even though it was clearly \"necessary\" for implementing the government's regulatory purposes (in the broad sense of \"useful\" or \"convenient\" adopted by the Court). As Justice Scalia's majority opinion in that case put it:\n What destroys the dissent's Necessary and Proper Clause argument . . .. is ... the Necessary and Proper Clause itself. When a \"La[w] . . . for carrying into Execution\" the Commerce Clause violates the principle of state sovereignty reflected in the various constitutional provisions we mentioned earlier.... proper for carrying into Execution the Commerce Clause,\" and is thus, in the words of The Federalist, \"merely [an] ac[t] of usurpation\" which \"deserve[s] to be treated as such.\" The Federalist No. 33\n The Court did not apply broad deference to the government's position and did not conflate necessity with propriety. Notice also that Scalia doesn't deny that the background check provision is \"necessary\" for implementing the goverment's Commerce Clause-based purposes. Unfortunately, neither Printz nor any other case gives us anything approaching a complete definition of what counts as \"Proper\" under the Clause. So I don't claim that the current precedent proves that the individual mandate is \"improper.\" But it is clear that propriety and necessity are two separate issues, and that the Court is not especially deferential to the government when it comes to the former. \n \n Orin also contends that the issue of what is \"proper\" was raised by the Respondents in Comstock. Unfortunately, Orin here conflates two separate questions: whether the statute serves a constitutionally permissible end and whether it uses \"proper\" means to do so. The Respondents did not argue that the relevant statute was an \"improper\" means to a constitutionally permissible end. Rather, the relevant section of their brief (pg. 37) claims that the statute did not promote a purpose that is within Congress' enumerated powers. The title of the section makes this clear: \"Police And Parens Patriae Powers Are Not Proper 'Ends' For Federal Government Regulation.\" \n \n The main point at issue in Comstock was whether a statute allowing the federal government to detain \"sexually dangerous\" federal prisoners after they had finished their sentences advanced an end that was connected to some enumerated power. That is a separate question from the issue of whether a statute that does promote a permissible end under current doctrine uses \"proper\" means to do so. The Respondents' brief unnecessarily confused matters by claiming that a statute that doesn't pursue a permissible end is not \"proper.\" In reality, whether it is \"proper\" is irrelevant because such a statute wouldn't pass muster anyway because it does not \"carry into execution\" one of the federal government's other enumerated powers, as the text of the Clause requires. I discuss this distinction at greater length in my article on Comstock, where I criticize the Court's expansive interpretation of legitimate ends, but also explain thatthat says nothing about the issue of the propriety of means.\n \n In any event, regardless of what the Respondents said, the Court nowhere defines \"proper\" in Comstock. Neither does it overrule Printz and other previous cases holding that propriety and necessity are distinct issues. \n \n At this point, I really have to focus on doing work on my (unrelated) article. I'm sure Orin, the commenters, and others will continue their discussion of the subject if so inclined. I also refer interested readers to Randy Barnett's excellent analyses here and here. In the latter article, Randy goes through the relevant precedent in much more detail than I can here. He is also, of course, one of the leading academic experts on the Clause.\n \n UPDATE: I should acknowledge that the Respondents' brief in Comstock does at one point suggest that the means used may be \"improper\" because they infringe on state prerogatives (35-36). I should have noted this in the main post, and I apologize for the oversight. However, the Court's opinion seems to ignore this argument. Alternatively, maybe the majority thought they had addressed this issue when they concluded that the statute \"accommodated\" state interests because it essentially allows states to opt out at will by choosing to take custody of the relevant prisoners themselves and then releasing them if they prefer. There is, of course, no such accommodation in the individual mandate. \n \n Be that as it may, what matters in Comstock (or any case) is not what the litigants say, but what the Court decides. And Comstock nowhere defines \"proper.\" Neither does it overrule previous precedents holding that \"necessary\" and \"proper\" are separate issues.\n \n\n \n Sorry sinjin and pardon the pun but you just got shot down without a parachute. :) emoticon_xgood\n \n Is there any other unconstitutional laws you promote?",

   "Here's a hint: The secondary market in 43 states where there are no background checks.\n\n \n I'm getting really tired of constantly being this bull**** being flung around as an answer. Despite all your claims you've been completely unable to prove that the private sales market is a leading source for criminals to get access to firearms.\n \n If you can't tell the difference between a legitimate sale between two private individuals, and somebody intentionally selling guns to a person they know is prohibited from legally owning them, then you really shouldn't be calling for what laws are needed or should be in place.\n \n \nOcassional bad apples means stay away from apples? Cut down the orchard? Good luck with that one.\n\n \n That's advice you should be taking, not dolling out. Occasional instances aren't sufficient grounds for pushing for brand new laws all over the country.\n \n \nSo I take it you'd return 2A rights to armed robbers, for instance, upon completion of their parole. Am I clear? \n Wouldn't want them to become victims of an armed robbery themselves.\n\n \n Holy **** man, how'd you make such a leap in logic? How does one even connect the dots on such a thing to arrive at a conclusion like that?\n \n Removing the prohibition that keeps certain people from being able to buy a firearm isn't the same as calling for their rights to be reinstated. All it'd do is make it easier to catch them in the act of committing another crime. If they're going to break the law then we set a trap and catch them in the act when they think nobody's looking. Instead of searching for them we make them come to us. \n \n \nHow about we leave strategy to LE?\n\n \n The same LE that isn't enforcing the laws against illegal immigration? The same LE that commits sexual battery on motorists, or slams people onto the ground simply because they're having a bad day? The same LE that has been caught selling drugs and guns in the evidence locker back to the bad guys? The same LE that body slammed an elderly woman to the floor in the aftermath of Katrina and dragged her out of her own home because she didn't want to evacuate the city? The same LE that was responsible for killing everyone at Waco? The same LE that engages in racial profiling?\n \n \nWe don't know their dealers because anyone can become one simply by purchasing second-hand in any of 43 states.\n\n \n Again, if you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys, you really shouldn't be pushing for policy changes. Your kill 'em all approach doesn't work in our society.\n \n \nSerious offenses especially involving firearms. Armed robbery, assault w/ deadly weapon, attempted murder, murder. Like those.\n\n \n If they're so dangerous and have proven that they don't want to abide by the rules that govern society, why should we allow them back into society in the first place?\n \n How can somebody prove themselves to be so damn dangerous they their rights have to be stripped away from them for the safety of society, and yet they don't pose enough risk to society that it's safe to release them back into the general public as if it was nothing?\n \n very paradoxical.\n \n [QUOTE]\nHow about regulate the commerce(i.e. NICS for all transfers of ownership) and deny criminals a primary source of untraceable firearms and gun-runners anonymity?\n\n \n Under what grounds would congress have the authority to enact such laws under the commerce clause? As Doc said, see Printz v United States.\n \n You really don't want to play the commerce clause game.

   "before Heller and McDonald:\n \n \nIt all gets down to a pair of very simple questions. Lets ask these to presidential candidates starting with Republicans who pander to the gun vote:\n *******\n The DC Court of Appeals released an opinion on March 9 in Parker et al. v. DC Government. After many pages in which the court fabricated an individual right to be privately armed outside of any militia or military context and struck down DC's gun control law, Judge Silberman arrived at these conclusions:\n \n \"Reasonable restrictions also might be thought consistent with a \"well regulated Militia.\" The registration of firearms gives the government information as to how many people would be armed for militia service if called up. Reasonable firearm proficiency testing would both promote public safety and produce better candidates for military service. Personal \n characteristics, such as insanity or felonious conduct, that make gun ownership dangerous to society also make someone unsuitable for \n service in the militia.\" \n http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/op... \n p. 54\n \n Registration of ownership, militia call up, proficiency testing, public safety regulation, screening for militia suitability. These are the makings of a firearms policy. Do you accept and support Judge Silberman's conclusion? Will your administration work towards a national firearms policy based on these conclusions?\n *******\n Doesn't anyone understand this issue? Judge Silberman's conclusions are not just the makings of a firearms policy. They are a devastating repudiation of the gun lobby's core doctrine that the purpose of all those guns in private hands is to maintain an anarchic balance of power between a privately armed populace, armed outside of the knowledge and reach of law, and any and all government. The gun lobby would fight viciously to defeat any legislative attempts to implement Judge Silberman's conclusions. The Supreme Court is not going to overturn them. \n Second Amendment, Gun Control, The Potowmack Institute \n More issues in Walter Dellinger letter \n Second Amendment, Gun Control, The Potowmack Institute \n DC Government v. Heller, SC case no. 07-290 \n Do we have to wait till this gets to the Supreme Court? The gun rights ideologies have been in the federal courts for more than thirty years. \n US v. Francis J. Warin, US Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, 1976 \n Silveira v. Lockyer, Second Amendment, Gun Control, The Potowmack Institute \n Nordyke v. King, 9th Circuit \n United States v. Timothy Emerson, Potowmack Institute, amicus curiae, Second Amendment \n http://wwwa.potowmack.org/parker.html \n Can we now get politicians to answer questions that get at what is really at stake? \n\n \n All lies failed to come true and you still support and trust an avowed socialist/communist that admitted the same about pg. 27? :xcensored",

   "I don't think they wanted felons flooding the lower courts with Second Amendment challenges to gun laws following Heller.\n\n \n Such cases have been happening even before Heller, and they all had to be heard by the courts regardless.\n \n Try again.\n \n \nI can't say how the courts would rule on bans on assault weapons. Sounds like a gray area. Some think that a ban on assault weapons would be okay because it's ban on unusual weapons, not weapons in common use:\n\n \n Not even close. Only a hoplophobe could arrive at such a conclusion. So-called \"assault weapons\" are nothing more than semi-automatic firearms. Semi-automatics have been available for sale to the civilian market since the very beginning of the 20th century, and so have detachable box magazines. To claim that they're unusual is to deny the history of firearms development and ignore history itself.\n \n And with so many definitions of \"assault weapons\" being offered up and expanded the net is being cast over more and more common firearms like the Ruger 10/22, or the M1 Carbine, or even the M1 Garand, or the Browning Auto5 shotgun.\n \n There's no way such firearms are \"unusual\" in nature. They're in very common use today. The Civilian Marksmanship Program sells M1 Garands and M1 Carbines to the public. The Camp Perry national shoot uses M1 Carbines, M1 Garands, M1As and AR-15s. Tactical Three Gun Match competitions are widespread and use just about every single semi-automatic firearm currently made or sold, where the AR-15 considered an entry level model in terms of ballistics and performance; in some matches the AR-15 is considered too weak to compete. So you fail yet again. Care to give it another go, or are you going to be smart and back off?\n \n \n\"Among other things, all the following anti-gun laws are A-OK according to the Supreme Court:\n *** Mandatory licensing to purchase firearms;\n *** Bans on the open and concealed-carry of firearms;\n *** Bans on private sales of firearms;\n *** Bans of so-called assault weapons and other 'unusual' weapons (that's the actual language Scalia uses);\n *** Bans on firearms on government property;\n *** Bans on certain calibers of ammunition;\n *** Bans on high-powered hunting scopes;\n *** One-month waiting periods;\n *** One-gun-a-month schemes;\n *** Mandatory ammunition fingerprinting.\"\n Second Amendment, Gun Control, Violence Policy Center: in line with the NRA\n\n \n Nope, not even close, sorry, you fail again. The Supreme Court gave grounds for absolutely none of that. They never said anything about allowing bans on commonly owned firearms, or ammunition, or allowing for heinous restrictions that wouldn't be considered constitutional when applied to other rights. If you can't mandate fingerprinting and training for a person who wishes to hold a public protest, or exercise an unpopular religion, then you can't mandate such for a person who wants to own a gun. It's just that simple.\n \n And you can't cite the Violence Policy Center anymore. They claimed the DC gun ban was both reasonable and constitutional, just like the Brady Campaign. They specifically said that a complete and total ban on an entire class of firearms was alright. The court told them they were completely wrong.\n \n According to you and the Violence Policy Center, in addressing the unconstitutionality of DC's handgun ban, the Supreme Court paved the way for a complete and total firearms ban. And that simply didn't happen. There's no grounds for a ban on any commonly available firearm. The firearm in question doesn't even have to be widespread owned in order to be protected. Simply being made in sufficiently large amounts and available to the public for purchase is grounds enough for it to be protected from banning.\n \n Seriously, show us where the Heller ruling determined that scoped hunting rifles and hunting ammunition can be banned.",

Oliver otherwise known as GEernst who claimed to have filed an Amici brief with the Supreme Court which did not accept nor consider it. Instead of page 27, I think he committed suicide on pg 17 and ceased to post. He posted it on Alamagorda Topix thread which is his style just like he tried to get his garbage on Emerson published by the Washington Post and they refused to publish it even if he paid for it. :)\n \n This is the depth of despair unconstitutional gun grabbers have fallen to, depth of despair and complete disaray. Star gazer is using a well know propaganda site that promotes socialism and communism and had used a legitimate name of a real university until we exposed it while his claims were being pushed in the Emerson case. There is nothing legitimate about it other than his claims that it is funded by a \"few wealthy benefactors\". I suppose they need a tax write off? emoticon_xgood\n \n I suggest he abandon reference to his pet organization which is filled with fantasy and anything but the truth. If GEersnt can't carry his own water it is a cinch that star gazer can't :) emoticon_xhoho I see we are getting pinged now by nono.com.",
