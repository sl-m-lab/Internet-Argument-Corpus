   "A top activist with the anti-tax Tea Party movement has had a personal brush with federal tax collectors. Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder and national co-ordinator for the Tea Party Patriots, owed, with her husband, over half a million dollars to the IRS when the pair filed for bankruptcy last year, according to filings examined by TPMmuckraker.\n \n The couple's bankruptcy filing, made in August 2008 to the US Bankruptcy Court for Georgia's Northern District, stated that Martin and her husband Lee Martin, of Woodstock, Georgia, owed the IRS $510,000, after making a payment of $16,640 that June. The couple also owed just over $71,000 to Ford Motor Credit, the automaker's financing arm.\n \n In an interview with TPMmuckraker, Jenny Beth Martin said her and her husband's experience with bankruptcy helped lead them to oppose the Wall Street bailout. \n\n Top Tea Partier, Husband, Owed IRS Half A Million Dollars | TPMMuckraker\n \n Conservatives have been quick to harp on Obama advisors who have tax problems.\n And I think that's a valid concern!\n \n It will be interesting to see if they have the same standards for their own leaders.\n Will these Tea-Party leaders continue to be an instrumental part of the \"tea-party\" movement?",

   "Similarly, she said, Rick Santelli's famed February rant against help for homeowners hit by the downturn struck a chord. She said that when she and Lee lost their home, they had the chance to apply for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \"but decided it was more important to take personal responsibility.\"\n \n But although the Tea Party movement broadly could be described as firmly anti-tax, Martin denied that the bankruptcy had led her to distrust the IRS's tax-collecting powers. \"What I have protested is the way the money is being spent, not to the fact that the government has to tax people,\" she said, citing roads and national defense as legitimate government functions that require taxation. She even said she supported existing welfare programs, which \"serve a purpose.\" \n \n Martin said that Lee's temp firm, which once employed 5000 people, had failed over two years ago, because of problems with a partner. Lee Martin, she said, was then faced with a choice between paying between paying the blue-collar employees who had earned their wages and were living paycheck-to-paycheck, or paying the IRS. He chose the former. \"I know my husband owes that money,\" she said. \"Had he paid the IRS [it would have] prevented those employees from getting paid.\"\n Top Tea Partier, Husband, Owed IRS Half A Million Dollars | TPMMuckraker\n \n\n \n You seem to have omitted an important part of the article. When you put these people next to Charlie Rangel, they come out looking pretty good, don't they? \n \n Let's see, victims of the recession who did the noble thing and chose to pay their employees, or a rich politician who \"forgot\" to report about 650k in income and assets. Not to mention, Rangel is the Chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, which is the organization responsible for our tax laws. I'm not so sure I want someone writing my tax laws that makes a $650,000 \"error of omission\" on his taxes. \n \n Personally, I have disdain for anyone who cheats on their taxes, both republican and democrat. I hold especially in contempt people like Rangel who simply try to cheat the system, despite their demonstrated ability to pay their taxes. If I did what Rangel did, I would probably be in jail.",
