The AIS is present in jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) but absent in all other taxa, including jawless vertebrates (agnathans). We argue that the AIS has been assembled from elements that have primarily evolved to serve other functions and incorporated existing molecular cascades, resulting in the appearance of new organs and new types of cells. Some molecules serving other functions have been appropriated by the AIS, whereas others have been modified to serve new functions, either after the duplication of their encoding genes or through the acquisition of an additional function without gene duplication. A few molecules may have been created de novo. The deployment and integration of the ready-made elements gives the impression of a sudden origin of the AIS. In reality, however, the AIS is an example of an organ system that has evolved gradually through a series of small steps over an extended period.\n \n \nnervous systems,\n \n \n Yep. For example, all metazoans have a primitive innate immune system. Most vertebrates have them, but agnathans (lampreys and hagfish) don't have only the innate system, and lack the sophisticated adaptive system of other vertebrates.

   "Even if the evolution is gradual, we would expect to see partially formed structures.\n\n \n Here is the argument for irreducible complexity in a nutshell. There are many examples of molecular machines, that are composed of numerous elements. Irreducible complexity rightly shows that such machines are irreducibly complex in that if any one part were removed, the function in question would be instantly lost. How then could such a machine be built up gradually if it will not work to any selectable degree until all its parts are present in their proper order?\n \n Michael Behe, the originator of this argument describes irreducible complexity as \"a single system which is composed of several interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning\". An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced gradually by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, since any precursor to an irreducibly complex system is by definition nonfunctional. Since natural selection requires a function to select, an irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would have to arise as an integrated unit for natural selection to have anything to act on. It is almost universally conceded that such a sudden event would be irreconcilable with the gradualism Darwin envisioned.\n \n Now add to this argument the fact that evolutionists will adjust and redefine their standard principles upon which natural selection by way of random mutations is based in order to counter this opposing view, and we see that they can't be consistent in their beliefs but must constantly redefine them in order to remain what appears to be a workable theory. Not consistent, just workable. Evolution shouldn't have to change the very premise upon which it is based in order to survive scrutiny. All available new evidence should fit neatly in its original package of assumptions if it is in fact a real and accurate scientific endeavor. \n \n Sure, they will write papers which attempt to explain and justify their pseudo science, which is more a philosophy than science in leu of this and other contradictory arguments, but they can't prove any of their claims with any solid evidence at all from the fossil record which they base their fallacious theory on. They will produce so called evidence from controlled experiments under laboratory conditions which set out to manipulate genes by artificially adding proteins and then claim this is evidence of it happening naturally. But we all know that is evidence of nothing more than gene manipulation by an intelligent designer which proves our point to any rational observer. \n \n Of course rationality is not a function of the evolutionists reasoning so we find ourselves at an uncrossable impasse between the secular based philosophy of evolution and the spiritually based philosophy of scriptural creationism. So it is, and so it shall remain until the Lord returns and these people see with their own eyes how wrong they have been.",

Let's see how decent my layman's grasp of biology is.\n \n For any entity that replicates itself, a feature is \"adaptive\" when it enables that entity and its subsequent copies to produce more copies of themselves than they would have been able to make without that feature.\n \n By contrast, a feature is \"maladaptive\" when it enables a replicator and its subsequent copies to produce fewer copies of themselves than they would have been able to make without that feature.\n \n And a feature is \"neutral\" when it enables a replicator and its subsequent copies to produce neither more nor fewer copies of themselves than they would have been able to make without that feature.\n \n Whether a given feature of a given replicator is adaptive, maladaptive, or neutral depends on circumstances external to the replicator, including not only non-replicating phenomena and conditions, but also other replicators.\n \n Just a layman's assessment. Feedback would be appreciated (especially from any of our more biologically knowledgeable forum-mates).\n \n \n...these molecules seem to replicate themselves perfectly or not at all. Which would not be 'adaptive' replication, as I mentioned earlier. Now I may have missed something obvious here....\n\n \n From the third paragraph of the section of the article titled \"Immortalizing Molecular Information\":\n \n \"Most of the time the replicating enzymes would breed true, but on occasion an enzyme would make a mistake by binding one of the subunits from one of the other replicating enzymes. When such 'mutations' occurred, the resulting recombinant enzymes also were capable of sustained replication, with the most fit replicators growing in number to dominate the mixture.\"\n \n Not entirely \"obvious,\" I suppose -- especially not with a head cold! :) -- but it's there. Imperfect copies do get made, and they even copy themselves, too.\n \n Lastly -- by way of connection to your discussion of teleology with Peeling -- note that the quantitative dominance of some replicators over others is not a final cause but a final effect. The literally mindless molecules do not \"intend\" or \"desire\" or \"strive for\" or \"hope for\" such an outcome. And the researchers don't, either. It is, perhaps, a predictable effect, thanks to the current state of our knowledge of evolution.

Changes are adaptive if they result in increased fitness, i.e., if they offer the organism an advantage in survival to reproduction.",

   "Thanks for the response. But I do not understand how you can have both a self-replicating molecule with imperfect self-replication. It seems to me that if two molecules are not identical then they are two different molecules altogether. OTH, if one molecule, as per your link, replicates itself perfectly, then no matter how many time it repeats the process, since it always gets 'the same answer', how can it be said to be 'adaptive'?\n \n \n \n Well, that's why I wanted clarification on the use of the word 'adaptive'. I just cannot see how anything [such as a simple chemical reaction] that is not itself a 'system' [and that word requires defining] can be said to be 'adaptive' to anything. Just because a thing can change, does not mean a thing can 'adapt'. Water can freeze or turn to steam, but that does not mean that water molecules 'adapt' to changes in temperature. I guess I'm saying that there is, to me, a difference between a simple mechanical reaction and a systemically positive, productive adaptation.\n \n \n \n Thanks for the link. Very interesting. I'll have to re-read it, but two things strike me--the RNA molecules required intelligent design in order to exist, and these molecules seem to replicate themselves perfectly or not at all. Which would not be 'adaptive' replication, as I mentioned earlier. Now I may have missed something obvious here, since I'm not as observant as I once was, and today I've come down with a head cold, so if I have done, please show me my error without making me feel stupid about it. :)\n\n \n Why do you think those 'molecules' need intelligent design? What, in principle, show that those RNA molecules can not form from other chemical reactions? To kick start the whole thing, all you need on one molecule in 100's of billions to be able to imperfectly reproduce.",

   "Here is the argument for irreducible complexity in a nutshell. There are many examples of molecular machines, that are composed of numerous elements. Irreducible complexity rightly shows that such machines are irreducibly complex in that if any one part were removed, the function in question would be instantly lost. How then could such a machine be built up gradually if it will not work to any selectable degree until all its parts are present in their proper order?\n\n I think it's unfair of people to condemn you for accepting this argument at face value, because it does seem awfully plausible. Nevertheless, here in a nutshell of roughly equivalent size is one illustration of why the argument is in fact meaningless.\n \n Stone arches. According to 'irreducible complexity', it is impossible for a stone arch to have been built up gradually, because if you remove even one stone, the whole thing collapses.\n \n What has IC missed here? Scaffolding. Stone arches are build over wooden scaffolding, which is then removed. The last gradual step was therefore the removal of a part, not the addition of one. IC misses this possibility completely.\n \n Scaffolding in a simple model of irreducible complexity evolving stepwise\n A Java simulation of an evolutionary process. Try it a few times on fast-fast-forward and it'll pause when it generates an IC 'organism'.",

The whole concept is retarded as it assumes everything that is can only function as it is, that things can't be modified from less efficient designs. The whole notion of ID is rather idiotic given our own history. We went from horse drawn carriages to model Ts to all kinds of various makes and models to the Tesla Roadster. ID would argue that God exists because it's too hard to make an electric car naturally as you remove one part and the whole thing fails.",

So we are at an intellectual impasse since no absolute results of what you so adamantly claim to be obvious exists at all. Yet you you pompously claim it is I who doesn't understand the science.\n\n \n I don't see anything on page 13 that addresses the argument I made. Do you even understand what i'm saying, Archangel?\n \n And of course there is evidence for what I said.

   "Correct me if I'm misunderstanding. It has been a while since I looked at any of this stuff. I understand that \"IC\" stands for 'irreducibly complex', and that 'irreducibly complex' refers to systems in which the various parts are so interdependent that the removal of, or damage to, or even random alteration of, any one or more of these parts renders the whole system completely non-functional, [with 'functional' implying 'productivity']. Am I right?\n\n \n Yup.\n \n \nSecond question, if I may? Supposing that there are/were no pre-existing parts, no pre-existing systems, no pre-existing 'adaptedness' to any previous context. Would it be possible to go from that state to a later state in which an irreducibly complex system then/now exists which is productive for/adapted to, any specified context? It would seem to me that the reply must be negative.\n\n \n To the extent that an IC would, in fact, have to evolve in one fell swoop, I agree that it would be very difficult to account for using standard evolutionary mechanisms.\n \n But like I said, we don't have to do that.\n \n \nWhich leads me to wonder, upon what basis can we reasonably presuppose any original \"preexisting parts that are adaptive in entirely different contexts\"? And, just to be sure, what do you mean when you use the word, \"adaptive\"?\n \n I'd just like to ponder over any responses. Thanks.\n\n \n We just look around and find them. See what the IC system is made up of, and determine if those parts are doing other, non-IC stuff. Turns out they are, which demolishes the argument Behe is trying to make.\n \n \"Adaptive\" here means \"favored by selection\" or \"increases differential reproductive success.\"",
