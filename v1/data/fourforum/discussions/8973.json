   "It is, but you have to give it to him, he does some seemingly original comedy, injects non-mainstream jokes (more fresh air), and does provide some great improvisation with guests.\n\n I do agree that Steven Colbert does come up with some original non-mainstream jokes, and he occasionally really \"nails things on the head\" when it comes to parodying the Religious Rights' view on various issues. I don't remember any longer who he was interviewing, but I saw an episode in which he was interviewing someone who supports Evolution and Steven Colbert basically made the spoof arguement that, since he himself did not understand the arguements of how a particular thing had evolved, the only other option was that it must have been made by an omnipotent designer. How true. I have never heard an anti-Evolution arguement from someone who has a clear understanding of the details of Evolution. \n \n On another point, it always struck me as curious why the Bush administration would have chosen Colbert to speak during a Roast at the White House Correspondents' dinner. Perhaps Colbert's extreme parody of the religious right was misinterpreted as subtle well intentioned ribbing. What may seem extreme to us is just slight exaggeration to them.\n \nI have to wonder if that's a turning point in a societies way of thinking. When the general consensus of the most powerful party, without being edited, can be considered outright parody/sarcasm to reasonable individuals (from any country).\n\n Unfortunately, propaganda techniques have improved significantly over the last century so I am not as optimistic that there is a real turning point. The Bush administration is well skilled at manipulative propaganda that can confuse or distort issues and generally influence people inexperienced in critical thinking. If the Iraq war wasn't going so badly, I am sure that Bush would still have a high job approval rating.",
