What would happen to all the existing children's lives if their class-size was increased by one third? Better yet, what about the welfare system, seeing as how most women who choose to have an abortion are poor. I'll bet the same person who shames her for having an abortion, would shame her for not being able to afford a child. Silly, silly person, don't you realize the decision is not about \"god's\" children? Don't you realize that the majority of the worlds' population does not even beleive in your god? Get another argument, because I can assure you, there is absolutely nothing you could say that can make that woman feel any worse as she lies on that table, awaiting the procedure. Your christian dilemma should be showing compassion to that woman.",

Since there has been about 100 Million births since then, it's easy to believe that 1/3 of all births have ended in abortion since 1973.\n\n \n The first part of your statement makes absolutely no sense. Typo? \"since Januart 22nd 1973 about 45 abortions have been done\"\n \n \nSince there has been about 100 Million births since then, it's easy to believe that 1/3 of all births have ended in abortion since 1973.\n\n \n This makes no sense either. Abortions aren't live births. How can you subtract the number of abortions from the number of live births and make that a percentage statistic?\n \n Anyway, fifty percent of pregnancies end before the twentieth week- \n \"{Spontaneous abortion} has been estimated to occur in 15 to 20 percent of all pregnancies. The actual number, however, is probably more like 50%. Many miscarriages occur very early, going unnoticed before a woman is even aware that she is pregnant.\n \n More than 80 percent of miscarriages occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Of these early miscarriages, at least half are thought to be caused by problems with the fetus's chromosomes.\"\n \n Also- \"About 1 in 200 women has repeated miscarriages, which physicians call recurrent spontaneous abortion. In many cases even these miscarriages happen by chance and do not signal a problem in either or both partners. Often no cause is found.\"\n \n At any rate, if you count the number of conceptions you would probably find that the percentage of induced abortions is relatively small.\n \n stats from http://www.empty-cradles.com/miscarriage.htm",
