   "Let's look at yet another Christian professor says. Let's first look at Dr. Robert J. Schneider's credentials, to confirm that he is educated in the proper area's of expertise.\n \n from http://community.berea.edu/scienceandfaith/author.asp\n \n Dr. Robert J. Schneider completed thirty-two years on the faculty of Berea College, retiring in 2001 as distinguished professor of general studies and professor of classical languages. He taught courses in Latin and Greek languages and literatures, and also general studies courses that explored topics in biblical literature, the history of Christian thought, the history of science, classical mythology, and contemporary fiction. His senior seminar at Berea College, \"Science and Faith,\" allowed him to combine life-long interests in science and in religious thought.\n \n A graduate of the University of the South (1961), Bob earned a doctorate in medieval studies from the University of Notre Dame in 1965. He also is the recipient of two teaching awards. In 1989 the student body and faculty of Berea College honored him with the Seabury Award for Excellence in Teaching, and in 1993 he received the Acorn Award for excellence in teaching and scholarship from the Kentucky Advocates for Higher Education.\n \n As an educator in the newly established field of science and religion studies, Bob reviews books for \"Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith\" and the \"Anglican Theological Review,\" and publishes scholarly articles. His \"Science and Faith\" course was awarded a John Templeton Foundation Science and Religion Course Prize in 1997. Bob is a member of the Episcopal Church's national Committee on Science, Technology and Faith, and chairs its subcommittee on Creation. He has also served as his Church's consultant to the Program of Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n \n \n This certainly beats a degree for trying to be a librarian any day.\n \n Now, what does he say.??\n \n From Does the Bible Teach a Spherical Earth\n \n \n\n Isaiah 40:22a--When is a Circle a Sphere?\n \n Here is how Isa. 40:22 is rendered in the NRSV:\n \n It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,\n \n and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers:\n \n who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,\n \n and spreads them like a tent to live in ...\n \n The critical line in Hebrew reads (transliterated and omitting vowels): hyshb 'l hwg h'rtz, which my colleague Dr. Robert Suder translates: \"the one dwelling on the circle/horizon of the land.\"14 A survey of Hebrew lexica and theological wordbooks15 yields much information about the key word hwg (ch\u00fbgh).16 According to K. Seybold, its root appears six times in biblical Hebrew, and it is clear from its usage in context that it has a specifically geometrical meaning, that is, \"a circle, as drawn with compasses.\" In Job 26:10 and Prov. 8:27, ch\u00fbgh is used with choq, meaning \"to inscribe a circle.\"17 This nominal infinitive form also appears in Job 22:14, where it denotes \"the circle of the heavens\" (shamayim), and in Isa. 40:22a, where it denotes \"the circle of the earth\" (haarets). Sir. 43:1218 uses ch\u00fbgh in describing the rainbow. Finally, in Isa. 44:13, mech\u00fbghah, a hapax legomena (a form used only once), means \"a compass,\" i.e., that simple instrument people my age used to draw circles in high school geometry class.19\n \n All but one of these contexts are cosmological, and in fact four of the five uses of ch\u00fbgh occur in creation hymns. Isa. 40:22a describes God as sitting/ dwelling above \"the circle of the earth\" which God laid out--with a compass, as Job 26:10 and Prov. 8:27 suggest, for the latter verses describe the act of inscribing the circle that fixes the boundary between the earth and the deep, the circle that also marks the boundary between light and darkness.20 The context also suggests that in Isa. 40:22a, the earth ('erets) which is encircled refers not to the earth as that part of the creation distinct from the heavens (Gen. 1:1)--as the creationists cited above seem to interpret it--but to other meanings of earth: as \"the dry land\" (Gen. 1:9-10), and at the same time, it appears, as \"the ground on which people and things stand,\" for \"its inhabitants are like grasshoppers.\"21\n \n A circle is no more a sphere in Scripture than it is in geometry.\n \n Looking at these usages together, I am hard put to see how anyone could justify rendering ch\u00fbgh in Isa. 40:22a as \"sphericity.\"22 The earliest translations of these Scriptures bear this out. In the Septuagint (LXX), the translators render the nominal and verbal forms of ch\u00fbgh in every case with the Greek g\u00fdros (noun), \"circle\" or \"ring,\" which they use in Isa. 40:22a, or gyr\u00f3o (verb), \"to make or inscribe a circle.\"23 G\u00fdros does not mean \"sphere,\"24 and in fact nowhere in any Greek recension of the Hebrew Scriptures will one find the proper word spha\u00edra used in this context at all.25 The history of the formation of the LXX is largely lost, and we do not know if the Prophets were translated in Alexandria as the Torah was in the third century BC.26 But if they were and if the translators were familiar with the concept of a spherical earth taught at the Museon of Alexandria, then the center of Greek science, they give no hint of it in their translation of ch\u00fbgh.\n \n Greek g\u00fdros turns up in its transliterated form gyrus--present in Roman literature as early as Lucretius (mid-first century BC)--in the Latin versions of the Bible as well.27 St. Jerome (c. 340-420), the early Latin Church's master linguist and Bible translator, began his work on the Old Testament by creating a standard version from the several unreliable Old Latin recensions then in existence, using as a valuable aid Origen's fair copy of the Hexapla which he consulted in the library at Caesarea around 386 AD.28 The Old Latin recensions were based on the LXX and commonly rendered this same portion of Isa. 40:22a as \"qui tenet gyrum terrae.\"29 Later, when he prepared a new version from the Hebrew that would become part of the Vulgate, he kept the Old Latin reading, changing only the verb tenet, \"dwells,\" to sedet, \"sits.\"30 And in his Commentary on Isaiah, Jerome, who is regarded by critics today as a competent and careful scholar,31 specifically rejected the notion that in this verse the prophet is referring to a spherical earth.32\n \n When we come to English versions, both early and recent, we find ch\u00fbgh interpreted in two different ways. The translators of the Authorized Version of 1611 were guided by the Geneva Bible, the version produced by English exiles in 1560, and adopted the latter's reading verbatim: \"... sitteth upon the circle of the earth ...\"33 Many late twentieth-century versions follow them (NKJV, NJB, NIV, NRSV), but some others render ch\u00fbgh as \"vault\" (JPSV, NAB), \"vaulted roof\" (REB) or \"dome\" (J. McKenzie34), interpreting the word to refer to the \"vaulted dome of the heaven\" (suggesting the raq\u00ed'a of Gen. 1:6-7), upon which God \"sits\" or \"dwells\" or \"sits enthroned.\"35 Seybold, however, rejects this interpretation and points to Isa. 40:22b in support of \"circle.\" The image of God sitting above the vaulted dome rather than the horizon circle would not change the divine perspective in any significant way, but I agree with Seybold that these renderings depart from the contextual meaning of ch\u00fbgh.36\n \n The prophet who uttered the words of 40:22 is the same prophet who proclaimed that Yahweh is the Creator who \"spread out the earth\" (42:5; 44:24). The Hebrew verb in both passages is raqa', which means \"to stretch out, spread out or abroad, cover over\" and, according to Theodore Gaster, \"to flatten out.\"37 Among his people in the exile community in Babylon,38 looking out over the enormous desert expanse that reached from horizon to horizon, it is not surprising that this prophet would describe God as \"flattening out\" the land. These other expressions also militate against the notion that the prophet was implying a spherical earth in 40:22a, and they act as a check against focusing upon one verse and reading it outside the larger context of this prophet's other inspired oracles of creation and salvation.\n \n If creationists had sought any support among biblical philologists, they might have found a nod given to them in the article on ch\u00fbgh by Edwin Yamauchi in the Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament. \"Some have held,\" he states, \"that Isa 40:22 implies the sphericity of the earth. It may, but it may refer only to the Lord enthroned above the earth with its obviously circular horizon.\"39 Yamauchi offers no supporting evidence for this concession to opinion, and in fact there is none that he or anyone else could give: a circle is no more a sphere in Scripture than it is in geometry. The preponderance of philological evidence and the translations of ancient scholars and modern experts alike provide overwhelming testimony that Isa 40:22a does not refer to a spherical earth. There is simply no warrant for Eastman, Sarfati, and Morris to declare, contrary to its plain sense and in violation of its semantic domain, that ch\u00fbgh literally means sphericity. They have read the earth's sphericity into the text, not out of it. And this is the conclusion to which I would lead my students.\n \n Job 26:7--Empty Space or Whatnot?\n \n Yamauchi concludes his article with: \"Note the remarkable concept given in Job 26:7.\" Let us turn now to this other passage. Here is how the NRSV renders this verse:\n \n He stretches out Zaphon over the void, and hangs the earth upon nothing.\n \n Like the poetic oracles of the prophet who proclaimed the words of Isa 40:22, the Book of Job contains some of the most powerful and affecting verse in the Old Testament. And Job 26:7, a couplet with a subject-verb-object-preposition-object arrangement, exemplifies an important feature of Hebrew poetry, its parallel structure. Here is the verse in a consonantal transliteration, followed by Suder's literal translation:\n \n nth tzphn 'l - thw tlh 'rtz 'l - bly-mh\n \n [He] stretches Zaphon upon chaos, suspends the land upon what (not)?\n \n Perhaps picking up on Yamauchi's reference, Walter Kaiser writes in his article on bel\u00edim\u00e2: (from bel\u00edi and m\u00e2: \"not-aught\"): \"Found only in Job 26:7. The Lord 'hangs the earth upon nothing' (RSV), a remarkable vision of the earth being supported in space by the power of God.\"40 It is this notion of the earth hanging in space that perhaps has encouraged creationists like Eastman and Morris to claim that this verse also refers to a spherical earth, although there is nothing that indicates plainly what shape of the earth the poet had in mind. I shall contend that interpreting Job 26:7 is a far from simple matter, and that its meaning is shrouded in mystery. The question is, can the mystery be penetrated?\n \n The ambiguity that characterizes this poetic hymn verse begins in the first line with \"Zaphon,\" which some translators retain in English (NRSV, JPSV, Marvin Pope41) while most render it as \"the north\" (Geneva Bible followed by KJV and NKJV; NAB, NJB); the REB reads \"the canopy of the skies\" and the NIV reads \"the northern skies.\"42 The Hebrew sap\u00f4n is of uncertain etymology, but in the Canaanite tablets unearthed at Ugarit in 1927, Zaphon is described as the mountain of the ba'alim. It has been identified with Mt. Casius in northern Syria. Zaphon as mountain is found in other passages of the Old Testament: in the derision song of Isa. 14:4-20, Zaphon is identified with the mount of assembly of the gods in the north (v. 13); and in the praise psalm 48, Zion the mount of Yahweh is called (v. 2) \"peak of Zaphon.\"43 Sap\u00f4n also came to mean \"the north\" as a compass point or geographical location.44 It was probably with this interpretation in mind that the LXX used the Greek word for \"north,\" bor\u00e9an; and both the Old Latin and the Vulgate used aquilonem, the Latin equivalent. Likewise, many English versions have used \"the north.\" Since heaven and earth are often coupled in creation hymns, some translators have interpreted sap\u00f4n here to mean \"the heaven.\"45 W. H. Schmidt opines that it is difficult to imagine a mountain being \"stretched out,\"46 and there are those passages in Isaiah in which God is said to \"stretch out\" the heavens (40:22b; 42:5; 44:24). Still, there is little consensus among translators as to its meaning.\n \n In the next line, there is a remarkable image: God \"hangs (or, suspends) the earth upon nothing.\" What does \"hang\" mean in this context, and what meaning of \"the earth\" is to be understood? The Hebrew word t\u00e2l\u00e2h here means \"hang\" in the sense of \"hang something on something,\" e.g., upon a peg (cf. Isa. 44:23-24; Ezek. 15:3).47 The meaning of \"earth\" ('erets) here seems somewhat ambiguous: it may refer to the earth as the other part of a bipartite creation,48 but it may refer also to the earth as \"the land.\" The combined words may remind one of Job 38:12-13, where God commands the dawn to \"take hold of the skirts of the earth\" (NRSV) and shake the wicked out of it.49 Does the poet by this metaphor suggest that the earth is to be imaged as a garment, not hanging down, perhaps, but spread out? No certain answer can be given, I think.\n \n The crux of this remarkable couplet, however, lies in the words that end each line. In the first, God \"stretches Zaphon over toh\u00fb,\" and in the second he \"hangs the earth upon bel\u00edim\u00e2.\" In the parallelism that characterizes Hebrew poetry, the same thing or concept is often repeated using a different word or phrase, so it may be that bel\u00edim\u00e2 in some way repeats or develops the notion intended by toh\u00fb. I shall review the various meanings of these terms, then examine how they have been rendered.\n \n The first, toh\u00fb, harks back to the toh\u00fbwaboh\u00fb of Gen. 1:1, where the earth, i.e., the other part of the creation besides the heavens, is described as \"formless and empty.\" HELOT refers specifically to Job 26:7 in giving \"nothingness, empty space\" as meanings. A. H. Konkel, citing the same verse, reads toh\u00fb as \"nothingness, void, emptiness.\"50 The word that concludes the second line is a hapax legomena composed of bel\u00edi and m\u00e2.51 M\u00e2 functions both as an interrogative and as an indefinite pronoun, meaning \"What?\" \"How?\" or \"aught.\"52 Bel\u00edi, meaning \"not,\" is a negative used primarily in poetry; rather than negating something it conveys the sense of \"without something.\"53 Kaiser renders bel\u00edima as \"not aught.\"54 But might m\u00e2 have an interrogative rather than an indefinite force here, as in Suder's translation? Is the poet asking \"what?\"\n \n If we put these two together, do we have a notion resembling toh\u00fbwaboh\u00fb, something that is akin to \"formless and empty\"? Does bel\u00edim\u00e2 reinforce and make stronger the meaning of toh\u00fb, the author expressing more intensely the sense of nothingness and emptiness over and upon which God \"stretches\" and \"hangs\"? Such an interpretation, and the parallelism evident in this couplet, might, in turn, lead the reader to take \"Zaphon\" literally, referring not to the northern skies but to the mountain that rests upon the earth to the geographical north and which might be understood as an earthly dwelling place of God, so that the whole couplet refers to the earthly part of the creation hung and stretched out over the mysterious \"not-anything.\"\n \n In 1560 and 1611, the heavens\n were understood to consist of a series of concentric spheres filled with the element aether;\n there was no such concept as \"empty space,\" at least not one acceptable to the great majority of the educated.\n \n Kaiser remarks that while it would be improper to impose twentieth-century cosmological knowledge on this creation hymn, \"it is nonetheless striking that 26:7 pictures the then-known world as suspended in space. In so doing, it anticipates (at the very least!) future scientific discovery.\"55 Comments like this as well as renderings of toh\u00fb as \"empty space\" might give encouragement to creationist interpreters of this verse. Before assessing this translation, let us see what tradition offers.\n \n The LXX translators appear to have understood these two words to be equivalent, for they rendered both by the Greek neuter form oud\u00e9n, \"nothing,\" using in the first line the accusative singular oud\u00e9n, in the second the genitive singular ouden\u00f3s, both with the same preposition, ep\u00ed, \"upon\" or \"over,\" which may express the concept of place with either grammatical case, and in particular with the accusative can convey the meaning of \"extension over a place.\"56 In the Old Latin versions, we find toh\u00fb rendered as nihilum, bel\u00edim\u00e2 as nihilum in aerem.57 In the Vulgate, Jerome, relying on the Hebrew, renders the first with the neuter accusative vacuum, the second with the neuter accusative nihilum.58 Both words are introduced by the same preposition, super, \"above, over, upon.\" The basic meaning of vacuum is \"not containing or holding anything, empty.\" Jerome evidently thought that it conveyed the meaning of toh\u00fb better than the nihilum of the Old Latin. The latter word has the basic meaning of \"not anything, nothing,\" thus to Jerome conveying the sense of bel\u00edim\u00e2.59\n \n The ancient translators seem to have attempted to render the Hebrew as literally as they could. Twentieth-century translators offer a variety of readings. Bel\u00edim\u00e2 is rendered as \"nothing\" (NIV, NKJV, NRSV, Pope), \"nothingness\" (NJB), \"nothing at all\" (NAB), \"the void\" (REB), or \"emptiness\" (JPSV), all introduced by the prepositions \"over\" or \"upon.\" Toh\u00fb is variously translated as \"the void\" (NJB, NRSV, Pope), \"chaos\" (JPSV, REB), or \"empty space\" (NIV, NKJV, NAB).\n \n I think the translation \"empty space\" is rather problematical. It is instructive to examine the difference between the readings of the KJV translators and their modern revisers. Instead of \"empty space\" (NKJV) the former, following verbatim the Geneva Bible, translated toh\u00fb as \"the empty place.\" Here is the entire couplet:\n \n He stretcheth out the North (KJV, north) over the empty place,\n \n and hangeth the earth upon nothing.\n \n The difference is telling to anyone familiar with the world-picture that prevailed in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The Reformation translators still lived in an Aristotelian and Ptolemaic cosmos, whether or not any of them had become Copernicans. Aristotelian science dominated the universities. In 1560 and 1611, the heavens were understood to consist of a series of concentric spheres filled with the element aether; there was no such concept as \"empty space,\" at least not one acceptable to the great majority of the educated. While it had come under serious criticism by some Renaissance philosophers, Aristotle's concept of Place (t\u00f3pos) still held sway. For Aristotle, everything in the Cosmos exists in a Place, which he defined as the \"containing vessel\" of a thing. The inner sphere of the revolving heavens constitutes the containing vessel of the earth, and likewise, within the domain of the earth each thing's place \"must need be ... the limiting surface of the body continent--the content being a material substance susceptible of movement by transference.\" In his exposition of this difficult concept in the Physics, Aristotle goes on to argue specifically against the existence of the Void, a central component of Epicurean atomism.60\n \n While the word \"space\" is attested in English as early as the fourteenth century, it is not used to convey the notion of physical or astronomical space, certainly not the absolute space of Newton or the relative space of Leibniz, before the middle of the seventeenth century.61 Because of its association with atheism, the concept of the Void also was not popular; atomism needed a \"baptism\" by theoretical physicist Pierre Gassendi in the 1650s to render it respectable enough to be incorporated into a world view acceptable to Christian thought.62 The Protestant translators in Switzerland and England would not have understood the concept implied in the \"empty space\" of their latter-day revisers.\n \n The translation \"empty space\" invites a popular interpretation based on a modern cosmology,\n not on the cosmology of the ancient Hebrews, and it lends encouragement to readers, whether creationists or not, to see in this passage in Job an \"anticipation\" of a modern concept.\n \n Yet, if these translators breathed an atmosphere that was Aristotelian and had the notion of Place as a part of their world view, they have turned it on its head. No place in Aristotle's world is \"empty,\" but these translators have written \"the empty place.\" What did they mean by \"place\" here? Specifically, what did they mean by \"the empty place\"? Were they expressing what to them would seem a paradox? Or were they simply trying to make sense of toh\u00fb given its basic meaning and this context, perhaps guided by the ep' oud\u00e9n of the LXX, with the prepositional sense of \"extension over a place\"? What they could not have meant by it is the \"empty space\" of a modern scientific world-picture, and that is what makes this particular translation so problematical. I think it is a good example of how a sincere attempt to render an ancient and puzzling expression into a term comprehensible to a contemporary readership can lead to misunderstanding.63 The translation \"empty space\" invites a popular interpretation based on a modern cosmology, not on the cosmology of the ancient Hebrews, and it lends encouragement to readers, whether creationists or not, to see in this passage in Job an \"anticipation\" of a modern concept. But, to go from an indefinite \"emptiness\" and \"what-not\" to \"empty space\" or \"infinite space\" (NJB comment) is too big a stretch, too expansive an interpretation. Better, I think, to leave its meaning a mystery, as it seems to have been to the translators who gave us \"the empty place\" of the 1560 and 1611 versions.\n \n What, then, can we make of Job 26:7? While its sense is hardly plain, one notion it certainly does not convey, I would tell my students, is that of a spherical earth held by the force of gravity in space (Morris). The earth that hangs on nothing is also the earth that rests on \"pillars,\" which tremble when God shakes the earth (Job 9:6), or upon a \"foundation\" with bases and a cornerstone (Job 38:6). It is also the dry land that God separated from the waters of the encircling deep (Gen. 1:9-10; Job 26:10; Prov. 8:27), that the psalmists describe as \"founded ... upon the ocean, set ... upon the nether-streams\" (24:1-2, JPSV; cf. Exod. 20:4), the earth which God \"stretched out ... above the waters\" (136:6 KJV). I see no value in trying to reconcile these many and varied metaphorical images with our own image of a spherical, rotating planet--aside from the fact that these ancients did not think of the earth as a planet. What Job 26:7, indeed the entire creation hymn of which it is a part, does convey, in all of its majesty and mystery, is the presence and power of the One who creates and sustains, and who holds all of the creation under his gaze. The response it calls for is awe, not scientific analysis.\n \n\n \n Easyrider (and J.P. Holding whom he mimics) is busted.\n \n These are not atheists, These are scholars that are trained in Greek and Hebrew. They are Christians. \n \n So, this totally disproves this is an 'Atheist' myth.",
