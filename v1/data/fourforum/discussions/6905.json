   "ok what if the bible is just a book of fictional storys that some one made a religion off of, like scientology. L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction and they made a religion of his books. now the bible is old so maybe the person who started the religion did not tell any on that its not real.\n \n \n \n scientology-souls comes from aliens\n bible- walking on water and a place with out pain.\n \n \n \n (if people go to hell becouse they dont say jesus is there the lord or somthing like that. then what about people that dont know about the bible.. a little unfair don't you think)\n im not saying the religions are bad. BUT DONT DONT GO SEE HARRY POTTER BECOUSE A BOOK SAID IT IS EVIL. people like that are just close minded jurks \n \n \n \n \n plz dont bring other people down\n \n \n \n sorry i went on a little rant there",

People who don't see Harry Potter are SILLY! Especially since this latest one is awesome. Very funny. Harry Potter is about witchcraft like Star Wars is about NASA. This is the same silly as those who fretted over the DaVinci Code. It's FICTION. \n \n By the way you spelled \"jerks\" wrong.",
