First, while he's out drumming up support and help for the Iraq effort (with NATO and the UN agreeing to help), he's setting up the transfer two days early so they won't have a chance to back out. Second, it leaves the terrorists holding an empty bag, despite thier claims of making the transfer as difficult as possible. This morning they woke up to a soveriegn iraq without any chance to screw it up. Beautiful! :p",

We're going to turn the Green Zone into the world's largest embassy (which means it becomes sovereign US turf) at a cost of $1 billion, 14 permanent US military bases are under construction and no elections are planned until next year with US puppets acting as the new 'sovereign government'.

Regardless of who's elected in November, we'll be on the financial hook for many years to come. I'm comfortable letting the history books sort it out 10-20 years from now.
