   "Im sorry, but this makes me a bit angry. I coult never stand Christian Fundamentalists, but this goes too far.\n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15463786/site/newsweek/\n \n I have about as much respect for these people as I do the KKK, or the Nazis. First of all, why would you try to discriminate against gay people? What did they do wrong in their lives? The same thing that blacks or jews did wrong? They were just born? Discriminating against any race, ethnicy, or sexual preferance is just filthy in my opinion. And look, the fundies are now trying to demonize women and abortion! Oh, goodie! This makes me want to throw up. Criminalizing a woman's right to choose, then attempting to brainwash people with fear. I mean, what if the fetus was gay? The Conservative fundies wouldn't want that would they? And now to suicide, even though I think suicide is horrible, why would God really care? If someone is so sad and wants to leave this world, then why the heck would God care? Is God really evil enough to force them to stay, or send them to hell?\n \n The way these people portray god, it seems like he is the devil. All logic leads to saying that God is evil enough to send the people he loves to hell? Does god know these people's circumstances?\n \n Christian fundamentalizm should be kept away from normal society, such as Islamic Extremism. You don't see any \"submit to allah or die\" houses, so why the heck should there be \"hell houses\"?",

To many, though, the following is nevertheless compelling:\n \n THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\n \n Circa 750 B.C.\n \n According to Amos 1:1, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (767-739 B.C.), and Jeroboam, king of Israel (782-753 B.C.). The name \"Amos\" is derived from the Hebrew term meaning, \"lift a burden,\" or \"burden-bearer\". His calling by God was to foretell of pending judgments upon a number of surrounding nations, and particularly of a coming judgment upon Israel, amongst other subjects. It is in the Old Testament book of Amos that we find a prophecy that for many centuries was looked upon with wonder and curiosity:\n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that the prophecy of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death. This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man, and as such it dispels the theory that Christ could have manipulated events so as to make it appear that He was the Messiah. But is there any evidence that this really occurred? Did the sun go dark at noonday? In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more that just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" \n \n Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Finally, the 2nd century Roman born jurist and theologian Tertullian referred to a Roman archives report of an \"unexplained darkness that took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, as can be seen in the archives of Pontius Pilate.\"\n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun. Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.

This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man, and as such it dispels the theory that Christ could have manipulated events so as to make it appear that He was the Messiah. But is there any evidence that this really occurred? Did the sun go dark at noonday? In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more that just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" \n \n Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Finally, the 2nd century Roman born jurist and theologian Tertullian referred to a Roman archives report of an \"unexplained darkness that took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, as can be seen in the archives of Pontius Pilate.\"\n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun. Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From God's perspective, it surely was a time of mourning for His only begotten son. \n \n Jesus once said, \"I am the light of the world.\" So it shouldn't be surprising that during his death there might be a time of darkness over the land. \n \n REFERENCE\n \n McDowell, Josh. Evidence That Demands A Verdict (Vol. 1). Thomas Nelson\n Publishers. Nashville. 1972.\n \n Cheers...\n\n I am apparently not one of the \"many\" to whom a coincidence is compelling. There have been even more suprising things that have happened, so the prediction of a solar eclipse is not that impressive. It is certainly not impressive enough to remove the various arguments against a literal interpretation of the bible.\n From that page:\n \n Julius Caesar's death was said to have been accompanied by Earthquakes, eclipse and a rising of the dead. ---et tu Jesus\n\n \n Also, if you want to argue that the moon was full at the time, I would like to point out that there were four solar eclipses in the year of 32 CE.\n \n By the way, I googled \"THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\" and got 5 hits: two of which said that it happened when Jesus died, one of which was yours, and two of which said it happened when Moses died.

On \"day\" one, God seperated the day and the night.\n On \"day\" four, God created the sun, which seperates the day and night. If you read the passage, the bible indicates that the sun does so. \n \n Two distinct possibilities for the \"light\" (\"Let there be light\"):\n \n 1. You assume this was the sun. Have you ever read Revelation 21:23? \n \n \"The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.\" So, the initial \"light\" can arguably be the light of God. Or it can simply be light appearing somewhere in the universe. (for 'morning and evening' see my prior post). \n \n 2. What perspective is light being observed from? Here's another possibility for consideration:\n \n When was the Sun Created? \n NCW 72, July-September 2001 \n by Christopher C. Warren\n \n Q. For some reason, according to the bible, God creates the earth, plants, and daytime before He creates the sun. I understand the writers of the bible did not have a full understanding of photosynthesis and such, but God did - who supposedly directed their writings. When the sun is finally created it is suggested that the sun exists for calendar purposes, not necessarily for day and light as it was already created (at this point, one must resist the temptation to think that the creation story is a primitive human perspective on reality, or maybe God created our beginnings in a chaotic and illogical fashion, perhaps to trick us into believing by means of faith only). Finally, after everything was finished, God rested. His error producing blueprints were set into motion.\n \n A. I will only answer the first part of this in the hope it will encourage you to be more carefully do your research before you start coming to absurd conclusions, though you are not entirely to blame. It is possible to intellectualise simple language until it becomes a meaningless fog, capable of most any interpretation that the intellect wants to promote. \"As a ring in a bull's nose easily leads a subdued animal, so a faulty paradigm leads to faulty interpretation, no matter where one turns in scripture\" (Dr.l Willard Aldrich).\n \n The Hebrew Bible nowhere states that the earth, plants and daytime were created before the sun. A careful reading of the primary Hebrew text (as opposed to our English translations which often reflect certain sectarian biases) reveals that the sun, moon and stars were all present in Genesis 1:1-3: \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was deserted and empty and darkness was on the surface of the ocean, And the Spirit of God was brooding over the waters. Then God said, Let there be light ... There was evening and there was morning - day one\".\n \n It must always be remembered that the description of creation is from a geocentric point-of-view, i.e. an observer on the earth. The writer of Genesis is not standing in space looking down on earth. That juxtaposition is critical.\n \n We continue: \n \n \"And God said, Let luminaries in the expanse of the air be for separating the day from the night. And let them serve as signals to mark seasons and days and years. And let them be luminaries in the expanse of the air to give light upon the earth. And it was so. God brought forth (not 'created' or 'made') two great luminaries - the greater luminary to dominate the day and the lesser luminary to dominate the night - the stars also. God gave them forth in the expanse of the air ... \" (Gen.1:14-16, literal translation).\n \n The point will become clear as we examine the literal words of two other passages: \n \n \"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? ... Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb, when I made the clouds its garment and thick darkness a diaper for it ... ?\" (Job 38:4,8-9). \n \n \"For six days Yahweh worked on the air and the land, the sea and all that is in them ...\" (Ex.20:11) \n \n In other words, the sun and moon and stars were all present from the beginning but were not initially visible from the earth's surface until the third day when the thick layer of water-saturated cloud was dispersed. \n \n http://www.nccg.org/FAQ325-Sun.html",

Jefferson admired the philosophy of Jesus, but did not think he as divine and specifically ignored the supernatural aspects of the NT (miracles, virgin births and the like). He made his own version of the NT leaving those out.\n \n \nThomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to William Canby, \"Of all the systems of morality, ancient or modern, which have come under my observation, none appear to me so pure as that of Jesus.\" He described his own compilation to Charles Thomson as \"a paradigma of his doctrines, made by cutting the texts out of the book and arranging them on the pages of a blank book, in a certain order of time or subject. A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen.\" \n\n He was referring not to the bible but to his abridged version\n \n Let's read more about this, shall we?\n \n \n\n He told John Adams that he was rescuing the Philosophy of Jesus and the \"pure principles which he taught,\" from the \"artificial vestments in which they have been muffled by priests, who have travestied them into various forms as instruments of riches and power for themselves.\" After having selected from the evangelists \"the very words only of Jesus,\" he believed \"there will be found remaining the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man.\" \n\n \n EZ. Is this the point you were trying to make with your quote?????\n What Jefferson meant by \"real Christian\" was not what you mean.",

   "Which was Jefferson then, a fool or a hypocrite?\n\n Neither; he was a deist who felt that the bulk of Christianity was ridiculous.\n \n \n\"A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never\n seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian,\n that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus.\"\n (Thomas Jefferson - Jan. 9, 1816 - In a letter to Charles Thomson)\nWhen Christians leap upon this as \"evidence\" that a major founder was indeed a Christian, we rationalists should quote further from Jefferson as to his definition of what a \"real Christian\" believes. In one of many letters Jefferson wrote to William Short, his long-time aide, he clarified: \"But the greatest of all reformers of the depraved religion of his own country, was Jesus of Nazareth. Abstracting what is really his from the rubbish in which it is buried, easily distinguished by its lustre from the dross of his biographers, and as separable from that as the diamond from the dunghill, we have the outlines of a system of the most sublime morality which has ever fallen from the lips of man. . . The establishment of the innocent and genuine character of this benevolent morality, and the rescuing it from the imputation of imposture, which has resulted from artificial systems, invented by ultra-Christian sects, is a most desirable object.\" (Thomas Jefferson, letter to William Short, October 31, 1819, according to George Seldes, ed., The Great Quotations, Secaucus, New Jersey: Citadel Press, 1983, pp. 372-373.). In a footnote to that letter to Short, Jefferson listed the doctrines he finds absurd and believes to have been the work of Jesus' false followers: \"The immaculate conception of Jesus, his deification, the creation of the world by him, his miraculous powers, his resurrection and visible ascension, his corporeal presence in the Eucharist, the Trinity; original sin, atonement, regeneration, election, orders of the Hierarchy, etc.\" In another letter, Jefferson even made clear that he believed that Jesus never claimed to be divine-Jefferson even used the label \"deist\" in describing Jesus. Two days before his 80th birthday, Jefferson added a bit more about what he did not believe about Jesus in another letter to Adams: \"And the day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter. . . . But we may hope that the dawn of reason and freedom of thought in these United States will do away [with] all this artificial scaffolding.\" (Thomas Jefferson, letter to John Adams, 11 April 1823, as quoted by E. S. Gaustad, \"Religion,\" in Merrill D. Peterson, ed., Thomas Jefferson: A Reference Biography, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1986, p. 287.) Good Christians may want to claim Thomas Jefferson as one of their own after reading things like that, but we skeptics have a right to tell them to report to their preachers what Jefferson said about Jesus and ask if that's consistent with being a \"Christian.\" Likewise, Paine quotes about the necessity of God and the beneficial nature of religion can be easily found but as easily countered with some of Paine's unrelenting, thoroughly politically incorrect, unambiguously scathing denunciations of the Holy Bible. [bolding and color added]\n[source]Clearly, Jefferson's \"real Christian\" is hardly at all a True Christian\u0099. In fact, Jefferson felt that the beliefs that evangelicals hold today were absurd and irrational.\n \n \nelectrolyte - Just another futile attempt by you to try to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.\n \n Go sell your follies to Michael Moore. He might like them.\n\n Rather than address my points in the slightest manner, your response consists entirely of this. (Think I'm surprised?) And you somehow think that I'm the one being defeated? But then, with your \"understanding\" of logic, nobody's surprised.",

   "So EZ do you concede that Jefferson was in no way a Christian of the fundamental or evangelical persuasion?\n\n \n Jefferson was a Unitarian who also thought Jesus' teachings were pretty nifty. Now, is that a Unitarian fundy? As opposed to an anti-Biblical fundy? \n \n And, speaking of fundies....\n \n Liberal Fundamentalism\n \n Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines, that seeks to elevate the ways and \"wisdom\" of man above the wisdom and desires of God. It's principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are \"revisited\" through suspect liberal \"scholarship\" or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of today's anti-God elitists. \n \n The genesis of today's liberal fundamentalists were the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and \"free-love\", illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat, and tears and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt. \n \n Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice were often foreign concepts to them. \"Right and wrong\", \"good and evil\" were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than it \"feels good, so let's do it\". The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their carnal minds was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values. They said not to trust anyone \"over 30,\" and now they're over 30 and say, \"Trust us, and what we teach!\" \n \n One of the most revered mantras of the liberal fundamentalists is \"equality\". The net effect of this experiment was to elevate women via the degradation of men; promote racial equality by instituting racial-based preferences and reverse-discrimination; engender class warfare against people of means via their redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other people's money, rather than rely on one's own personal initiative and work ethic); and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, and other corrupt lifestyles) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal \"tolerance\". However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a corrupted partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one will likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. \n \n Rather than truly embrace \"freedom\", liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses which are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools and the workplace, embrace a de-facto litmus test against possible pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, seek to squelch free religious speech via \"hate-speech\" laws (Note Canada), and generally engage in a whole range of behaviors alien to the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values. \n \n IMO, Liberal fundamentalism generally undermines the basic effectiveness of the government, legislatures, and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of Fundamental Liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, Liberal Fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence.",

So, according to you, Jefferson believed that God did not intervene in the affairs of men and nations.

That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (TJ - Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n So here's the question you need to answer, Moose:\n \n Why do you suppose Jefferson would tremble for his country and fear God's wrath if God did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations?\n \n Also,\n \n \"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we\n are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their\n native land and planted them in a country flowing with all\n the necessities and comforts of life.\" (Monday, March 4,\n 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address)\n \n Who led Israel out of the wilderness?

What other reason could drive them to do this?\n \n \nNonetheless, your suggestion that 'deep down he knows this whole religion thing is BS' is intriguing. I often wonder as I read yet another biblical fundamentalist going through absurd logical contortions as he tries to dispose of some embarrassing contradiction whether, deep down, they really do realise just that.\n\n \n Yes, my opinion is deep down he is questioning it, but he doesn't want to admit it in fear of being damned. IMO, fear drives people to do these kinds of things. And if you've ever read the bible, its full of \"do this or go to hell\" statements. Thats what I think is driving EZ. If there wasn't a hell, I'll bet most religious nuts would feel free to question their own religion and keep their mind open. But since they are in fear of being damned, they do not allow themselves to think beyond, or even think for that matter.",

Funny thing about those embryos they always emerge as humans unless something abnormal happens.\n\n \n Key word \"emerge\". They are not humans yet. Thats why I'm not for third trimester abortions, because it develops many human characteristics and thats when its rights come into play. Besides, if the woman wanted an abortion she should've gotten it much earlier.\n \n \n \nWhat all pro-abortion proponents have in common: Their mothers ALL chose life!\n\n \n There is not such thing as \"pro-abortion\". We are pro-choice, not pro-abortion. We don't like abortion, most of us don't like killing anything, but its a hard descision and its not black and white. You guys always assume that abortion is wrong, when the woman is in so much agony and depression that they have to have an abortion. Pro-choice means that we should let the woman choose her fate. Pro-life means the government should decide the woman's fate. And, what you say is life is just a fancy word for \"force\". You force the woman to have a baby. You force her not to have an abortion. You deprive her of her liberty to her own body. Stop hiding behind the word \"life\". \"Force\" is the most accurate description.\n \n If you don't like abortions, then don't have one. That is why we have CHOICE. Those who don't like abortion dont have one, and those who need one do. Many women do not share your viewpoint on abortion, so why should your views be forced on them and deprive them of their liberty? I'll bet that if men had to go what women went through in pregnancy, then the pro-life movement would be dead. Pro-life men are hypocrytes that have no buisness deciding a woman's fate, based on a botched hypothesis of theirs about \"life\". Notice that most pro-lifers are men and most pro-choice advocates are women. Therefore, i think women should be the only ones voting and deciding on this matter, seeing that it does not concern men at all.\n \n Heres a good read by a Newsweek writer:\n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15173072/site/newsweek/\n \n \n \n\n The Clinic: A no spin-zone\n \n It's the determination to stay within the zone of privacy that has made abortion an easy mark for cheap mythology and easy demonization.\n \n \n \n Oct. 16, 2006 issue - For anyone who has spent a lifetime listening to the bumper-sticker rhetoric of abortion politics, hearing Renee Chelian describe how she does things at the Michigan clinics she oversees is, no question, a shock to the system. \"We're not going to correct a woman when she says 'baby' instead of 'fetus' and 'killing' instead of 'termination',\" says Chelian flatly.\n \n \"If it's her body, she gets to use her terminology. We have to speak the language of the patients, not of political positions. Women don't come to us and say, 'I'm having an abortion because it's my choice.' They say, 'I'm having an abortion because I can't have a baby.' And sometimes they feel sad about that.\"\n \n These are some of the honest discussions taking place around America's most contentious personal moral and ethical issue. They're found in places like Northland Family Planning, where the counseling staff may suggest that a woman who is uncertain complete a pie chart with the heading \"How much of you wants what?\"\n \n At clinics like Chelian's the staff deals with the actual, the difficult, sometimes the terribly necessary. But in the legislative world, it's all about strategy. When South Dakota's governor signed a measure banning almost all abortions, much of the second-guessing that followed could have concerned a tax cut. Would a more moderate approach have been better for the Republicans? Would the legislation push more female voters toward the Democrats? On Planet Spin, it was possible to forget completely that the legislation could change the destinies of many ordinary women. A coalition of nurses, teachers, doctors, ministers and other nonpoliticos finally brought the matter back to earth and onto the ballot for all the state's residents to consider in the November election.\n It's the determination to stay within the zone of privacy that has made abortion an easy mark for cheap mythology and easy demonization.\n Recently the House passed a bill that would make it a federal crime to accompany a minor seeking an abortion from a state that requires parental notification to one that does not. Like most abortion debates, this one had its stock characters: the grandmother imprisoned after helping a girl impregnated by her stepfather, the young woman victimized by the predatory older man. If those sound like plotlines from Lifetime movies, it may be because none of this had much to do with reality, with almost no chance of squaring the House and Senate versions of the law for a compromise that could be sent to the White House. But voting the bill out now gave House conservatives something to crow about just in time for the midterm races.\n \n The conventional wisdom about parental-notification and consent laws was that they would cut down on abortion, which is why anti-abortion activists loved them. But earlier this year The New York Times ran a jaw-dropping analysis that found the laws had no significant impact on teenage abortion rates. (They also may be way behind the curve; at Chelian's clinic, young women already tell counselors that you can order an ulcer medication online that all their friends swear will cause a miscarriage.) The statutes did, however, have one unintended consequence. \"We have parents who come in and want to force their daughters to have an abortion,\" Chelian says. \"Their attitude is, 'If I can prevent you from having one, I can force you to have one.' And we have to tell them that that's not so. The mother will say, 'She's 14, I'm already taking care of her sister's baby, I can't take care of another one.' You know that it will be really hard for everyone.\"\n \n Public pronouncements rarely make any of this sound hard for anyone, since they're too often based on mean-spirited assumptions. The gay-rights movement has shown over the last two decades that a powerful enemy of such misinformation is personal testimony, that coming out as an individual can combat the big lies about the group. In that spirit the current issue of Ms. magazine contains a list of the names of thousands of American women under the headline WE HAD ABORTIONS. It is riveting, even disconcerting, because telling their own abortion stories seems in direct opposition to the bedrock belief that this decision, above all, is not subject to the scrutiny of strangers.\n \n \n \n",

   "The fetus / baby has all the genetic characteristics of a human being from the start. Only termination of the fetus / baby will stop it from being someone's sister, brother, son or daughter.\n\n \n Again, key word \"genetic\". My hair has the genetic characteristics of a human, but that doesn't make getting a haircut murder does it?\n \n \n \n \nThat's a misnomer. There's no pro-choice for the baby in that kind of argument. It is the innocent victim.\n\n \n Again, there is no baby. If any babies were being murdered, i garuntee i would protect the babys. But is completely innacurate to say that a fertilized egg inside of a woman's stomach deserves a \"pro-choice\" or is an \"innocent victim\". My nails are of the human species and have human DNA, does that make nail clipping murder?\n \n \n \n \nOnce again, you don't take it out on the innocent victim - the baby. Many who have abortions agonize and are depressed later over terminating the baby.\n\n \n What baby? Maybe that is true, but much more problems almost always come out of having an unwanted child than aborting the embryo.\n \n \n \n \nExcept for rape, no one forced the woman to drop skirt / trou and copulate to begin with.\n\n \n Women are not going to abstain from sex. They have a very little chance of having a baby, they have birth control, and just in case there is abortion. But its damn unhealthy to abstain, and it can cause pedophilic behavior. That what a lot of the catholic church sex scandals are about. Women are not going to risk their sexual and emotional health just because there is a slight possibility of having a baby. Sex is a normal part of life, deal with it.\n \n \nOnce she makes that decision she needs to accept personal responsibility for it and protect the innocent life she has helped create.\n\n \n If it is just an embryo, then abortion is not immoral nor should be illegal. I create innocent life when I take my vitamins. I create cells, does that mean I have no right to drink soda because it is \"killing innocent life\"? I have a right to drink soda, just like she has every right to abort if she cannot have a baby.\n \n \n \n \n \nLet's rephrase that to see the Achille's Heel of that point of view: If they could talk, the innocent unborn would very doubtfully share your viewpoint on abortion, so why should your views be forced on them and deprive them of their life and liberty?\n\n \n The thing is, they can't talk. They cant think, they cant feel, they're like a plant. Stop anthropomorphizing the embryo, it is far from human. If the embryo had a brain, feeling, and could talk, damn right i'd be pro-life. But if plants could talk and move and have human intelligence, i would not weed my garden and I would feed them extra well. An embryo is not a person, a plant is not a person. The thing is, an embryo has no feelings, no brain, and no heart. Its not even aware of its own existance. It feels nothing, so it cannot be anthropomorphized like you are trying to paint it to be.\n \n \n \n \nThey need to not only think about all that before copulating, but they also need to accept personal responsibility for their creation afterwards.\n\n \n See above.\n \n \n \nI also haven't overlooked the cost to society for this bloodthirsty binge of abortions: Tens of millions of scientists, teachers, welfare workers, etc., do not exist today.\n\n \n That is highly unlikely, as unwanted children are 10x more likely to become criminals. What you should've stated is \"tens of millions of rapists, murderers, bank robbers, and sexual predators do not exist today\". Again, lets get back to my point. It would be hihgly hypocritical of you to tell a woman what to do and not to do with her body, when you are not a woman and you do not go though the same thing. Regardless of your views, it is hypocritical.\n \n \n \nNor is their tax money available to pay for all the additional social welfare programs the liberals and others would no doubt be otherwise enjoying.\n\n \n Acutally, you're twisting statistics. If abortion would be made illegal, the people of america would have their bains taxed out trying to pay for all the poor teenage mother's welfare, the babys welfare, its food, its clothing, shelter. America would be paying for waaay more prisons to be built because of the huge crime wave that has come from criminalized abortions. Prisons would be overpacked, many more americans would be raped, killed, robbed, assaulted from the crime wave. Taxes would also need to be raised from all the destruction and vanadlizm that these unwanted children cause. So, in essence, America would be a lot better off with legal abortions than criminalized.",

First of all, why would you try to discriminate against gay people? What did they do wrong in their lives? The same thing that blacks or jews did wrong? They were just born? Discriminating against any race, ethnicy, or sexual preferance is just filthy in my opinion. And look, the fundies are now trying to demonize women and abortion! Oh, goodie! This makes me want to throw up. Criminalizing a woman's right to choose, then attempting to brainwash people with fear. I mean, what if the fetus was gay? The Conservative fundies wouldn't want that would they? And now to suicide, even though I think suicide is horrible, why would God really care? If someone is so sad and wants to leave this world, then why the heck would God care? Is God really evil enough to force them to stay, or send them to hell?\n \n The way these people portray god, it seems like he is the devil. All logic leads to saying that God is evil enough to send the people he loves to hell? Does god know these people's circumstances?\n \n Christian fundamentalizm should be kept away from normal society, such as Islamic Extremism.

I find it preposterous and insulting that the followers of Jesus insist that he was somehow of divine origin. Can't you just settle with just following his teachings?\n\n \n Did Jesus Claim to be God?\n \n Among the religious leaders who have attained a large following throughout history, Jesus Christ is unique in the fact that He alone claimed to be God in human flesh. A common misconception is that some or many of the leaders of the world's religions made similar claims, but this is simply not the case. \n \n Buddha did not claim to be God; Moses never said that he was Yahweh; Mohammed did not identify himself to be Ahura Mazda. Yet Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, said that he who has seen him (Jesus) has seen the Father (John 14:9). \n \n The claims of Christ are many and varied. He said that He existed before Abraham (John 8:58), and that He was equal with the Father (John 14:9). \n \n The New Testament equated Jesus as the creator of the universe (John 1:3), and that He is the one who holds everything together (Colossians 1:17). The apostle Paul says that God was manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16, KJV), and John the evangelist says that \"the Word was God\" (John 1:1). The united testimony of Jesus and the writers of the New Testament is that He was more than mere man; He was God. \n \n Not only did His friends notice that He claimed to be God, but so did His enemies as well. There may be some doubt today among the skeptics who refuse to examine the evidence, but there was no doubt on the part of the Jewish authorities. \n \n When Jesus asked them why they wanted to stone Him, they replied, \"For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God\" (John 10:33, NASB). \n \n This fact separates Jesus from the other religious figures. In the major religions of the world, the teachings -- not the teacher -- are all-important. \n \n Confucianism is a set of teachings; Confucius is not important. Islam is the revelation of Allah, with Mohammed being the prophet, and Buddhism emphasizes the principles of the Buddha and not Buddha himself. This is especially true of Hinduism, where there is no historic founder. \n However, at the center of Christianity is the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus did not just claim to be teaching mankind the truth; He claimed that He was the truth (John 14:6). \n \n What Jesus taught is not the important aspect of Christianity, but what is important is who Jesus was. Was He the Son of God? Is He the only way a person can reach God? This was the claim He made for Himself.\n \n Suppose this very night the President of the United States appeared on all the major networks and proclaimed that \"I am God Almighty. I have the power to forgive sin. I have the authority to raise my life back from the dead.\" \n \n He would be quickly and quietly shut off the air, led away, and replaced by the Vice-President. Anybody who would dare make such claims would have to be either out of his mind or a liar, unless he was God.\n \n This is exactly the case with Jesus. He clearly claimed all these things and more. If He is God, as He claimed, we must believe in Him, and if He is not, then we should have nothing to do with Him. Jesus is either Lord of all or not Lord at all. \n \n Yes, Jesus claimed to be God. Why should anyone believe it? After all, merely claiming to be something does not make it true. Where's the evidence that Jesus is God? \n \n The Bible gives various reasons, including miracles and fulfilled prophecy, that are intended to convince us that Jesus is the one whom He said He was (John 20:30, 31). The main reason, or the sign which Jesus Himself said would demonstrate that He was the Son of God, was His resurrection from the dead. \n \n When asked for a sign from the religious leaders, Jesus replied, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40, RSV).\n \n In another place He said, when asked for a sign, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up . . . but he spake of the temple of his body\" (John 2:19, 21, KJV). The ability to raise His life back from the dead was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone else who has ever lived. \n \n Anyone wishing to refute the case for Christianity must explain away the story of the resurrection. Therefore, according to the Bible, Jesus proves to be the Son of God by coming back from the dead (Romans 1:4). The evidence is overwhelming that Jesus did rise from the grave, and it is this fact that proves Jesus to be God. \n \n This is an excerpt from the book, \"Answers to Tough Questions,\" by Josh McDowell and Don Stewart. \n \n \nI've got nothing against Jesus, but I'm starting to get really POed with some of his followers. I can understand following his teachings, but ever since the beginning of Christianity Jesus's followers have blown off all his teachings, preferring instead to persecute, insult, and condemn anyone who refuses to join their cult, even if that person has never done anything wrong throughout his entire existence. Whatever happened to \"Love thy neighbor...\"? \n\n \n Indeed, that's found in your own Tanakh. Why then don't you love your Christian brethren?",
