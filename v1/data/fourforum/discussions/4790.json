   "Let us discuss a little bit Russian oligarch in disgrace Boris Berezovsky. If you follow the latest news, you must realize that he started collecting discreditable information on all people who came to power in the result of \"velvet revolutions\".\n \n The records Boris Berezovsky got from ex-major Nikolai Melnichenko contain about 300 hours of conversations which contain discreditable information on Victor Yushchenko, Yulia Timoshenko and other activists of the \"orange revolution\".\n \n Boris Berezovsky also receives new information from his old friend Badri Patarkatsishvili which casts a slur on Georgian government (for example, the facts proving Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili and Irakli Okruashvili to eliminate Georgian Minister on Emergency Affairs David Zhvania). Boris Berezovsky also has his people in Kyrgyz opposition (he receives information on every oppositional leader). The same in Azerbajan (it is connected with the so-called \"Chechen refugees\"), Armenia (Armenian Revolutionary Federation - Dashnatsutyun), Kazakhstan and Belarussia.\n \n Actually, Boris Berezovsky is currently the main claimant to reap the fruits of the \"velvet revolutions\" initiated by the U.S. in post-Soviet states. \n \n Plus, Berezovsky now got unprecedented influence in Latvia and Lithuania thanks to numerous pedophilia scandals among local politicians and presidential retirements by Boris Berezovsky.\n \n In fact, Boris Berezovsky is currently building up his own empire on the territory of the former USSR where he will act a habitual role of \"grey eminence\" staying behind the ruling regimes.\n \n Only God knows what Broris Berezovsky's activities may result into in the former Soviet Republics. Maybe, it is time for Washington to set him up?...",
