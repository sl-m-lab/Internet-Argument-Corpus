If the wife has adequate personal wealth to provide the level of care she's seeking, there should be no problem maintaining the feeding tube. An amulance could supply the necessary interim requirement while on way to a truly private facility. \n \n If public funds are being used, even partially and few hospitals exist without it, to maintain his hospital existence, following the law to the letter is required or the MDs risk having their certification withdrawn. The nursing home not accepting him after the tube being withdrawn sounds like they also have public funds involved as that would put them in a position of liability if they counter an existing medical opinion based on current code and he dies in their care. \n \n Sounds like she's using public money while attempting to circumvent existing law?",

   "I have no idea if she's using public or private funds. Insurance or out of the pocket.\n \n The sounds of it, from previous experience with similar fields, is that the nursing home has regulations to follow. Even if it's a private facility, they have to follow state guidelines IIRC. As such, they might not be capable of 'legally' inserting a feeding tube into a patient.\n \n He went into a coma in 1999ish and was in private care for a while until he developed pneumoia and had to go to a hospital for treatment of that. \n There, the doctors used the 'futile' law and chose to follow guidelines saying she had 10 days to seek private care or he's off of support.\n \n I don't know all the details, if he's feeding tube only or full heart- lung support (one site said full, another and the news said feeding tube).\n I also don't know if of how she failed to transfer him to a nursing home in the 10- days given. It could have been miscommunication, it could have been the nursing home had no room...*shrug*\n \n But, Texas has that futile treatment law.\n \n \n Other similar cases were for Sun Hudson (deceased) infant who was removed from support, IIRC against his parents wishes.\n and currently Knya Howard, a 5 month old who was born with lieukemia and while at the hospital contracted the flesh eating virus. For the news, she's visably alert and it was mentioned that the doctors gave her a 5% chance of making it.\n So, futile now includes a 5% chance of survival (or less). But, she hasn't been fully judged upon by the medical committee who are called to make that determination but, it sounds like they'll desire to disconnect her feeding tube.\n And it's doubtful her parents could afford alternative care...and insurance companies (assuming they have insurance) probably wouldn't cover it if the doctors denied it themselves.\n \n \n Another ironic thing is some recent March of Dimes Walks that have been going on. Charitis to help people born premature or with birth defects.\n Seems like if the 'futile support' laws are prepetuated and carried by more people, these types of charities will be near useless...since saving those extremely premature infants would be deemed futile by some one at some point.\n \n Doesn't seem like Bush was thinking on loopholes when he signed that law several years back. \n It's understandable to allow a brain dead person to die or to remove heart lung machines from some one in a coma as their death is fairly quick but, I think it pretty cruel to remove the feeding tubes to an active 5 month old and allow her to starve over the next few days because 'it's more compassionate than allowing her to \"suffer\" in her current situation.'",

   "I say in all cases where 2 or more doctors have recommended the removal of support (ventilators, IV's, feeding tubes, dialysis, etc...), the family or interested POA should foot the entire bill for all care themselves (or by donations of interested private parties). You cannot tell me that Terri Schiavo and many like her are not receiving some form of financial assistance provided by public funds. In cases where public funding is used towards the care of a medically declared \"hopeless\" case, the public should have a say in what happens. What has been going on for years and years in this country is like taxation without representation. In the Schiavo case, the majority of adults in this country supported removing the feeding tube and allowing Terri to die. Even in a fake democracy the people should get what they want occasionally.",

   "From a strictly money point of view, pull out the tube.\n \n From an emotional point of view, family's desires, leave the tube in.\n \n If you're looking to compare this situation to the Schiavo case, you can't. This man is in a coma. He's simply unconscious. While there's no guarantee he will wake up, there is no guarantee he won't, either. There are many documented cases of coma patients waking up years after their coma began, and probably as many cases of those that never woke up. I think that the insurance company should do what they were contracted to do - provide medical care when someone gets ill. \n \n Then there's the fact that the hospitals and homes are greatly overcharging for their services, and getting rich off of both the insurance companies and the private citizens. But that's another thread entirely.\n \n I'm reminded of a college friend's thoughts on the matter; he called it the 100 year rule: if the person would have died 100 years ago, you should let them die. If they could have survived, then take care of them.",
