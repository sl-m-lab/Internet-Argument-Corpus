SUVs and pickups, the most profitable models for US domestic manufacturers, will experience the largest cutbacks. \n \n Ford has also brought in outsiders to seek solutions to its dilemma of declining market share and financial problems in an attempt to bypass entrenched internal management decisions, something both Ford and GM should have done some time ago.\n \n Any opinions on Ford's decline and at what point they'll finally have to get out the sharp knife and fix some of their problems?",

I didn't read your link, was there any mention of the inevitable: reducing employee wages and pensions?\n\n \n I'm not familiar with Ford's dealer franchise agreements. Since at one time they were highly desirable investments, I'd think all key points regarding dissolution would be in Ford's favor. You're correct, there are some serious private investments in dealerships and inventory. I can't think of any orderly manner for Ford to begin closing them without hoards of lawyers descending on each closing. \n \n The only labor comment was 6000 white collar employees being dismissed over an unspecified period of time, a positive measure. Nebulous comments from Ford about plant closings which analysts trounced on as no real plan in place (shades of GM) and the usual PR crapola from Ford Jr. Since they've finally decided to get some hopefully objective outsiders in place to make recommendations on the tough calls, perhaps the blue collar labor issue is next. \n \n Ford reduced the quarterly dividend and while that'll help cash flow, stock and bond holders have to be very upset at declining equity and credit ratings. Ford, like GM, needs someone to slash and burn to get blood flowing in the halls quickly, before they lose all opportunity to put operating costs in line with market share. We're obviously heading into an economic decline and if they don't get straightened out before that deepens they'll be grasping at straws to avoid BK shelter for survival. \n \n On that note, Ford was just overtaken by Toyota in passenger car sales. A former sports star, who owns multiple successful dealerships including high-end imports, has announced the opening of the largest US Toyota dealership in San Francisco, CA. A sign of the times?",

   "Not only did Toyota surpass ford in passenger car sales, they surpassed them in total number of vehicles sold folloing a 40% decline in truck sales. I guess maybe the folks in detroit were wrong when they said that gas prices would not impact purchasing decisions until they hit $4 per gallon (actually, the method they used to calcualte this was ludicrous. They figured $4 per gallon gas in a vacum, with no cost increases in other sectors). \n \n The rumor I am hearing is that the 6000 white collar workers are from management. Havign touched base with ford a few times on a professional level, I can only imagine this will be a good thing. Americans need to figure out that getting a piece of paper from a degree mill does not necessarily entitle you to a do nothing paper shuffling manageent job. You can only have so many paper pushers before you actually need some production staff.",

Which means they're also going to take a hit on their used truck sales. Looks like I'll drive the F350 for awhile.\n\n \n I have an F450 and an avalanche, both purchased within the last year (I needed the write off) that I would hate to sell right now. My little brother used to be a mechanic at the largest for dealer in the KC area (since quite and gone back to school). He called me the other day to let me know that he could get me any used SUV or pickup on that dealers lot for $5000 or less. Apparently over 85% of trade ins in recent months have been SUVs and pickups, and they can't give the things away. They shipped 26 to the dealer auction last month and got 25 of them back. Apparently even recent decreases in gas prices have not helped the situation. People have figured out that high gas prices are here to stay and simply lack the disposable income to feed a fuel hungry vehicle. \n \n \nSome of the non-vehicle merchants I know in our small town have said this is the slowest summer they can remember in a long time and that's not good in a resort town with long, business slow winters. And our real estate market from $300-900k has literally died from interest rate increases. Ford isn't the only domestic industry experiencing serious problems.\n\n \n We recently took a trip to the branson area, and the manager of the upscale resort where we stay was telling me that this has been one of their worst seasons ever. He was saying that typically a bad economy has not particularly damaged their business because Branson is something of a fallback location. In bad years, customers who do not take vacations are replaced by customers downscaling their vacations and seeking a cheaper destination. For the first time ever they have had to slash room rates in order to fill beds (I know our cabin was about 20% cheaper than usual). \n \n We also have a time share down that way (at Big Cedar) and I know that they are suffering pretty badly as well. \n \n I would expect for things to get worse. The little town where I live essentially has a mix of agriculture and manufacturing. In the last 18 months we have lost 2 major factories (one driven under due to chinese imports, the other moved to mexico) and seen large reductions at 2 others. A little research shows that this is pretty typical in the manufacturing sector. Coupled with high gas prices, it stands to reason that vacation destinations are going to suffer. People simply lack the disposable income to take a decent vacation.",

They saw the changes as troubled spots to bully their way through as opposed to recognizing them for what they were....shifts in the basic fundamentals of their sector. As a response to a temporary market slowdown, their strategy was not bad. As a response to a complete paradigm shift, their strategy was disastrous. \n \n 18 months or a year ago the question was \"How will they weather the changes in the industry\". IMO, the question today is \"Will they survive the changes in the industry\". The difference is the steps they have taken to date, which were so damaging and so out of touch with reality that they threated their very existence. They tried to put a bandaid on a severed arm and move ahead, and by now they have lost so much blood that it is going to take one hell of a doctor to repair the damage. \n \n IMO Ford is especially guilty of this. They had the advantage of time over GM. GM was in trouble immediately, Ford had their profitable pickup sales to keep their head above water while they worked out a plan. they stood by, doing nothing, until those sales had withered away, now they are trying to implement what amounts to an emergency plan, set in place to deal with a situation that has been obvious for 2 years. \n \n 8 months ago a source that is usually very reliable told me that Bill Ford had actually stated, in his presence, that if Ford could not turn around car sales, that they would abandon them and move to only selling trucks. That was their last man standing, nexus of all possible bad ####, super fall back plan. Talk about detachment from reality. One of the primary factors they were blaming for the decrease in sales was efficiency. Did upper management at Ford REALLY THINK that this was not eventually going to impact truck sales, and that the results would be anything less than obscene?",

   "Ford and GM have so many problems that coming up with the seed money to do a takeover would be a major obstacle. Ford voting stock is still controlled by the Ford Family, so that one is probably out. Lawyers representing GM suppliers, unions and pension funds would surely tie up every single asset in litigation before they could be liquidated a conventional takeover. \n \n I get sick and tired of people blaming legacy costs for Ford and GM problems. Where do those defenders of poor management think those costs came from? The world is supposed to say poor babies, we're sorry you made those bad calls sating labor union demands since WW2 to avoid strikes while pumping quarterly and annual profits resulting in fat bonus checks, continued making them into this century with no thought to the end result? Unskilled assembly line workers didn't reach $65/hr on a merit system. \n \n Those legacy cost management decisions are no different than a concentration on marketing gas guzzling SUVs and pickups for personal use in a time of US foreign aggression driving oil prices while ignoring development of fuel efficient vehicles. Or reducing quality control levels during the '80s and '90s to benefit short-term profitability. Both companies have lost credibility with two generations of vehicle buyers and that's not a situation one turns around with a face lift of old models or air-filled statements of restructuring. GM has been restructuring for the last 15-years. Both companies are obviously running out of customer bases consisting of WW2 vets and neocon minded, scared, middle-aged citizens. Their credit ratings now defy R&D bond money for innovations that attract future buyers (the only reason for alignment with Nissan, etc.).\n \n So, what's left?
