   "More often than not, \"dialogues\" between Christians and their critics take place on the Christian's home ground - while the critics are \"playing away\". In this thread, I'd like to step away from the testimony wars, doctrinal disputes, and creation myths, and stand on neutral territory in order to examine some aspects of the social and political utility of religion. \n \n From an external perspective - let's say that of an anthropologist or even my favorite hypothetical figure, the \"impartial observer\" - the functions of religion in society look very different from the view taken on interior lines by the faithful. In other words, a clinical inquiry reveals \"socio-political facts\" about a religion that might be either invisible or not important to its clients. After a brief survey of some of these \"facts\", some with positive effects and others having a negative impact, I want to draw attention to a relationship between a certain religious outlook and an economic system.\n \n If we subject religious enthusiasm to a dispassionate scrutiny, we must concede straight away that a number of pluses might be detected in a society which has been penetrated by religious ideas/ideals. For example: religion tends to promote social cohesion and makes a significant contribution to the creation of a cultural identity; religion tends to bind society together under the aegis of an \"absolute\" moral law; the quality of aesthetic achievements in art, literature, and music is much influenced by religious sentiments, etc., etc. (More could be added, but the general idea has been outlined). \n \n On the minus side, religion acts as a conservative brake in society and tends to support or even to sanctify the authority of the powers that be. The Christian religion, among others, has a pernicious history of reactionary intolerance which is not only well adapted to effecting social control, but which has also inhibited the growth of independent thought and critical inquiry. The persecution of skeptics, freethinkers, scientists, heretics, etc., can be interpreted as the response of a conservative power structure which fears and resists any challenge to its authority. (Again, much more could be added, but space forbids it).\n \n To conclude this bald and utilitarian summary of the \"objective\" status of religion in society, here's a few sentences about the economic relationship I mentioned previously. \n \n It's a well documented fact that after the Reformation, a new religious outlook began to flourish. This outlook was informed by private study of the Bible, the inculcation of Protestant virtues such as thrift, hard work, and self direction, and a revolt against Catholic traditionalism that incubated an individual and rational approach to life and business. While it would be absurd to pretend that capitalism was invented by the Protestant dissenters of the 16th century and the question of cause and effect is disputed, it remains the case that capitalist precepts were found to fit very neatly into the Protestant theory of living a life in the service of God. From this perspective, one could argue that the risk-taking spirit of capitalism is justified by a divinely ordained \"work ethic\". \n \n Finally, if we consider the reasons why the Pilgrim Fathers sailed to the New World in \"The Mayflower\", and the subsequent success of capitalism in the United States, it seems that the Protestant work ethic has had a more profound influence on Americans than any other people on earth.",

   "Well, it has always been in every American school child's textbook that the reason the people boarded the Mayflower was to avoid religious persecution--to practice their faith in freedom. Is it your contention that the wind propelling the sails was capitalism?\n\n \n I get the impression American school history textbooks tend to knee-jerk on the word 'freedom'. The Puritans were harassed, certainly, but their main complaint was that they weren't free to impose their views on others. 'In 1616, the people of Lancashire complained that local Puritans were trying to stop their usual Sunday amusements, including dancing and archery. When the Puritans got into power after the execution of Charles I in 1649, they closed the theatres'. (http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/guide17/timeline05.html). This seems like a distant pre-echo of the you-have-to-tolerate-my-intolerance argument currently proceeding on another thread.\n \n Portraying the Mayflower pilgrims as victimised freedom-seekers is, I think, naive. The idea of personal freedom as you enjoy it would have horrified them.\n \n \nI hope this point can be expanded, since it isn't readily apparent to me. What precepts were capitalists able to apply? Did practicing Catholicism somehow stifle capitalism?\n\n \n I won't speak for Alan, but it's my conviction that religion changes to match socio-economic change, not vice versa. It wouldn't have been a case of Catholicism stifling capitalism; rather that as the socio-economic system shifted from rural feudalism to urban capitalism, a more rigidly monotheistic and prohibitive form of christianity was found to be a better fit.\n \n In other words, I would reverse the text of Alan's that you quoted: 'while it would be absurd to pretend that Protestant dissent was invented by the proto-capitalists of the 16th century and the question of cause and effect is disputed, it remains the case that the Protestant theory of living a life in the service of God was found to fit very neatly into capitalist precepts'.",

Max Weber seems to suggest the former, and Richard Tawney the latter explanation. For myself, I'm uncertain and would seek refuge in an explanation that suggested a \"reciprocal\" or \"dynamic\" connection between Protestant ethics and the spirit of capitalism. \n \n I mentioned the Pilgrim Fathers on the simple hypothesis that the dissenting mind-set which they brought to the New World, would be fertile ground in which capitalism could flourish - as indeed it has, and especially in America. I agree with John that the pilgrims assuredly did not embark on the \"Mayflower\" hearts glowing with a liberal political philosophy ! \n \n In reply to billsco's question about Catholicism stifling capitalism, I think it's really a matter of contrast or degree: capitalism was already well established in pre-Reformation Europe (e.g. in the Renaissance cities of Venice, Florence, Genoa, etc.), but the 16th century impetus from which capitalism has grown into the dominant economic system in the entire world, is associated with those Protestant virtues, precepts, values, etc., that we've been talking about. It should be emphasised that Protestant religious sentiment can be understood almost as a \"progressive\" departure from reactionary Catholicism.",

An obedient, sober workforce was necessary to service the mills and factories; though unlike the peasants working the land in earlier generations they lacked the incentive of producing the stuff of their own subsistence. An authoritarian proprietor-god would be just the ticket for keeping the unwashed masses in their place; and if he told them they mustn't drink or distract themselves in the pursuit of pleasure, so much the better for profits.",

The Protestant movement certainly would have the feeling of great liberation to a person living at that time. \n\n I think John offers a more astringent opinion than the rather uncritical assertion I made. But perhaps both views can be accommodated here if only because we are discussing a rather slippery social theory. \n \n Protestantism could be described as a \"liberating\" movement in the sense that it rejected the authoritarian traditions of Catholicism and permitted, indeed required, that each individual should search the scriptures with a view to entering a personal relationship with God. Catholicism, you will recall, does not encourage any private study (of the Bible) which might lead to \"unorthodox\" interpretations that undermine its authority on matters of faith and morals. \n \nBut what I'm not understanding is capitalism's relation to that. Were businessmen allowed greater freedoms? Was money-lending, say, blessed? What was the preacher saying that the priest wasn't?\n\n What the preacher was saying amounted to a religious justification (or a reinforcer) for economic motives and behaviours that already existed. The Catholic priest was concerned to reconcile the faithful to their miserable lot, not to encourage the use of one's talents and calling on this earth to the greater glory of God and, simultaneously, to improve one's estate - which is the essence of the Protestant work ethic. \n \n The problem of usury has never been resolved by Christians - whether Catholic or Protestant: it has been swept aside as an inconvenient barrier to the unproductive pursuit of profit. \n \n \nAnd how was a Protestant work ethic developed? How did a common man become convinced hard work was godly? Why would John think \"a more rigidly monotheistic and prohibitive form of christianity\" be a better medium in which to grow capitalism?\n\n The idea of using one's natural talents and earthly calling to the greater glory of God would obviously tend to justify the economic calculation of the entrepreneur. If you have a talent for operating a bank, then making lots of money from banking is doing God's work.\n \n Its appeal to the common man, if literate and talented, might be described as a call to his self-interest; few can resist such a call even if it involves hard work, and especially if it has an \"imprimatur\" from Almighty God !",

Nazi speakers did not tire of portraying Hitler as the last bulwark against the threat of communism, the final hope of peasants and workers, the protector of the Christian religion.... \n\n \n They were liars too. \n \n Was Hitler a Christian?\n \n Hitler believed in telling the \"big lie,\" and there are some today who have been duped into continuing to propagate some of his lies. Specifically, I'm talking about Internet atheist types who--incredibly--assert that Adolf Hitler was a Christian. This notion can easily be dispelled by performing a very meager amount of research--which is exactly what I've done. \n I recently read the book Hitler's Cross, by Erwin W. Lutzer. The information contained in that book puts Hitler's \"Christianity\" in a very revealing light. I haven't double-checked Lutzer's sources, though the book seems quite trustworthy to me. But just to assure the reliability of my case I'll also quote from William Shirer's classic, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, which the New York Times called \"one of the most important works of history of our time\" and \"a splendid work of scholarship, objective in method, sound in judgment, inescapable in its conclusions.\" \n \n First of all, in order to determine whether Hitler was a Christian, we need to define \"Christian.\" If by Christian we mean someone who believes the words of Jesus and tries to follow them, then Hitler was absolutely, unquestionably not a Christian. But if by \"Christian\" we mean \"a person who claimed to be a Christian but whose real goal was to do away with Christianity and instead have himself revered as the most exalted being ever to walk the earth,\" then, well, Hitler was a Christian. But to define such a person as a Christian would be absurd. We might as well say that because Hitler wanted to conquer and devour Poland and France that he was a Pole or a Frenchman. \n \n Now it's true that in his youth Hitler must have had, at least for a time, some kind of Christian belief, since he tells us that as a boy he had a passing interest in becoming a clergyman. But that ended. At some time in his life Hitler apparently turned completely against Christianity. \n Yes, he did make public claims to Christianity even while he was in power and persecuting Christians. But those public professions were simply lies. He made them in order to win the support of the German people, but in reality he wanted to do away with Christianity as it had hitherto been known and pervert it into a mere facade for Nazism and worship of himself as the ultimate leader. In Hitler's own words:\n \n \"[Making peace with the church] won't stop me from stamping out Christianity in Germany, root and branch. One is either a Christian or a German. You can't be both.\" (J. S. Conway, The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, quoted in Lutzer, pp. 113-114.) \n \n \"One cannot break the Church over one's knee. It has to be left to rot like a gangrenous limb...but the healthy youth belong to us.\" (Quote of Hitler in Lutzer, p. 130.)\n \n This is what Hitler was saying in private once he became Chancellor of Germany. So we know that at least by that time he was definitely not a believer in Christ. And yet at the same time Hitler was advocating what he called \"Positive Christianity.\" But what exactly did this \"Christianity\" consist of? Alfred Rosenberg, the man Hitler appointed as the philosophical guiding light in the Nazi party, drew up some plans for the \"National Reich Church.\" Here are some excerpts, from Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: \n The National Church is determined to exterminate irrevocably...the strange and foreign Christian faiths imported into Germany in the ill-omened year of 800. \n \n The National Church demands immediate cessation of the publishing and dissemination of the Bible in Germany.\n \n The National Church declares that to it, and therefore to the German nation, it has been decided that the Fuehrer's Mein Kampf is the greatest of all documents. It...not only contains the greatest but it embodies the purest and truest ethics for the present and future life of our nation. \n The National Church will clear away from its altars all crucifixes, Bibles and pictures of saints. On the altars there must be nothing but Mein Kampf (to the German nation and therefore to God the most sacred book) and to the left of the altar a sword.\n \n On the day of its foundation, the Christian Cross must be removed from all churches, cathedrals and chapels...and it must be superseded by the only unconquerable symbol, the swastika. (Shirer, pp. 332-333.)\n \n Anyone who thinks this is Christianity has probably lived in a bunker all his life.\n \n Hitler did succeed in getting a great deal of control over the German Protestant church. The Protestants who embraced Hitler called themselves the \"German Christians.\" At one huge rally of these \"Christians\" a Dr. Krause spoke the following:\n \n ...the liberation from all that is un-German...from the Old Testament with its Jewish recompense ethic, from all these stories about cattle-dealers and pimps...Our provincial church will also have to see to it that all obviously distorted and superstitious reports should be expunged from the New Testament, and that the whole scapegoat and inferiority-type theology of the Rabbi Paul should be renounced in principle, for it has perpetuated a falsification of the gospel.\n \n Interesting understand of Christianity those Nazis had. A \"Christianity\" that rejects the Bible is a travesty, a fake Christianity.\n \n Dr. Hans Kerrl, Hitler's Minister for Church Affairs said this after meeting with a couple of church leaders: \n \n The party stands on the basis of Positive Christianity, and Positive Christianity is National Socialism [Nazism]...God's will reveals itself in German blood...Dr. Zoellner and Count Galen have tried to make clear to me that Christianity consists in faith in Christ as the Son of God. That makes me laugh...No, True Christianity is represented by the party, and the German people are now called by the party and especially by the Fuehrer to a real Christianity...The Fuehrer is the herald of a new revelation.\n Shove Christ aside and exalt the Fuehrer as the herald of a \"new revelation.\" Just another example of a cult using the name of Christianity as a front for their own self-invented belief system.\n \n But although the Nazi leaders talked about Christianity, did they really believe in even their own brand of Christianity without Christ? Well, here's what Shirer has to say: \"It would be misleading to give the impression that the persecution of Protestants and Catholics by the Nazi State tore the German people asunder or even greatly aroused the vast majority of them. It did not...Not many Germans lost much sleep over the arrests of a few thousand pastors and priests or over the quarreling of the various Protestant sects. And even fewer paused to reflect that under the leadership of Rosenberg, Bormann and Himmler, who were backed by Hitler, the Nazi regime intended eventually to destroy Christianity in Germany, if it could, and substitute the old paganism of the Nazi extremists.\" \n \n As Bormann, one of the men closest to Hitler, said publicly in 1941, \"National Socialism [Nazism] and Christianity and irreconcilable.\"\n \n Hitler a Christian? Oh the lies that people will believe. \n \n Compliments Geocities.com",

Hitchens quotes former missionary workers and visiting doctors consistently observing that the order's medical practices and facilities remained inadequate, despite the money the order was receiving. \n\n \n http://www.wc.pdx.edu/motherteresa/mothert.html\n \n \"The mission that Mother Teresa founded was different than others in that it refused to engage in formal fundraising. Instead, the Missionaries of Charity both begged for food and money, and relied heavily on the money raised by word of mouth. Mother Teresa and her organization have been criticized by many for their lack of preventative, problem-solving programs. The people who criticize her believe that resources are more wisely used in to try and solve underlying problems so future people won't be affected by them. However, members of the mission stand firmly behind their policy of helping and comforting those dying or in pain right now; they believe the future will take care of itself. Today, helping the less fortunate is exactly what the mission is still doing. What started with little money and a handful of sisters has now become a worldwide organization with over seven thousand nuns and brothers, in over a hundred different countries. This organization is dedicated to helping the poor, unwanted, and sick of the world. Although Mother Teresa died in September, 1997, her organization plans to continue on for many years to come.\n \n Before her death, Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize, the Order of Merit (presented by Queen Elizabeth of England), and countless other awards from various individuals, governments, and organizations around the world. Her death was mourned by the millions of people for whom she made life a little better.\" \n \n Also, I still find it interesting that people would criticize someone on HOW they conduct their humanitarian effort, when those criticizing them aren't doing anywhere near the effort to provide aid themselves. It's not that Mother Teresa is \"beyond criticism,\" it's just that criticizing her often makes one look pretty darn hypocritical.",

But hey, if you want to look like a fool, go right ahead and accuse her of bad ethics. Knock yourself out! :p\n\n \n This is the last post I'll make on the issue, as we're off-topic for this thread. \n \n The words I've emphasised above are yours, not mine. Perhaps there should have been a scandal when the court which tried Charles Keating, the biggest fraud and embezzler in American history, asked Bojaxhiu to return the $1,250,000 he had donated: the money had been stolen mainly from small and poor depositors, but she never replied to the request.\n \n 'Bad ethics' is more complicated. I suspect Bojaxhiu genuinely believed she was doing god's work, and that her ends justified any means. Perhaps you feel the same. She seems certainly to have believed that there was merit in suffering: numerous witnesses were dismayed by her hospice's lack of pain-killers, as well as other basic aspects of medical care. She is on record as saying \"I think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot, to share it with the passion of Christ. I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people.\"\n \n I don't think there are any 'inconsistencies and irrationality' in the arguments I have cited against Agnes Bojaxhiu. The world has an image of a saintly, selfless nun who devoted her life to alleviating suffering. Hitchens and others give an alternative perspective: a fanatical devotee of suffering and poverty, who placed the achievement of a 'good death' for her patients above the relief of their pain or the curing of their ills, whilst always seeking out the very best in modern medical care for herself.\n \n As I said, I'll draw a line there. Do feel free to have the last word, or if you want to continue the exchange take it to your 'Christian aid' thread.",

Is this a fair analogy to your line of thought ?\n\n \n Yes, it's a very close analogy. Chomsky's work (and Pinker's) strongly suggests that the brain's 'wiring' is pre-adapted for the acquisition of language. Kohler has made a similar suggestion re the acquisition of moral rules. If there is a similar pre-disposition to seek and find cause-and-effect relationships, then a drive to generate causes for otherwise inexplicable phenomena might well lead to a belief in the existence of invisible causal agents; and this could underlie the evolution of what you call religious sensibility.\n \n Before anyone else points them out, I'm fully aware of the ifs and mights and coulds in that statement, and will reiterate that this is no more than a plausible conjecture. Evidence for it is hard to come by, though Lewis Wolpert has written interestingly about evidence arising from certain kinds of mental illness.\n \n On edit. The above might lead people to assume that by this argument religion is a 'mere' spin-off of some other brain function. Even it arose that way, as the topic of this thread attests it did not stay that way. Evolutionary biologists are familiar with the concept of 'pre-adaptation': a structure or process or behaviour that evolved to fit one function provides the raw material, by a different selective pressure, to be adapted to a different one. Even if a belief in the numinous was a side effect in the first instance, many posts above have shown how functional it was to prove in social and cultural evolution.",
