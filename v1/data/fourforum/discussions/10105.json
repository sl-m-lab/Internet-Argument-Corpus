   "Utterly fascinating series of televised interviews with diplomats, military staff and politicians from all sides of the spectrum. There have been 8 hearings so far; I have only started watching tonight due to time constraints, the same constraints that have prevented and will prevent me from posting regularly, but seriously if you want to educate yourself about the current issues in the region you cannot do better than watch these interviews, all of which are avalable here:\n \n http://www.channel4.com/news/microsites/I/the_iraq_commission/index.html\n \n If time permits I may bring up individual points from the hearings, but assuming that this will not happen, I hope that those of you who have a genuine interest in learning the facts of the current events, their implications and their causes, will watch these programs and discuss whatever seems important to you. The topics covered are many and varied, as one might expect, and the information on offer is orders of magnitude beyond what one gets from the regular media. Enjoy and discuss. This is important.. I cannot overemphasise how much I have learnt just watching one of these programs, let alone all 8, and this information is too valuable to not be widely spread.",
