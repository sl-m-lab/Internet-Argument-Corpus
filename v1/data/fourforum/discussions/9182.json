   "Does anyone know of any codified rules for debating on the internet? Would it be possible to apply some form of parliamentary procedure to an internet forum so resolutions can be formally introduced, debated, amended, referred to committee et cetera?\n \n There is an organization called Unity08 that hopes to conduct an online national convention to draft a campaign platform and nominate a fusion ticket (1 Democrat and 1 Republican in either order) for president and vice-president and then get the ticket on the ballot in every state for the 2008 election. I've often thought of setting up a website to hold something like a national convention (for entertainment as much as political reasons), but I don't see how it wouldn't end up being just as chaotic as every other message board I have been on.",

   "I should add that some effort should be made to balance the participants so no single part of the political spectrum can overwhelmingly dominate the debate. I often find myself being targeted by the Left because I am a Creationist and I want low taxes, but then the Right comes after me because I don't support GWB or the GOP to their satisfaction. In such cases I get no enjoyment from participating.",

A chosen few get to participate, and the rest--the disenfranchised--are left voiceless on the sidelines. Their input is not welcome.\n \n \nYou would also have limit how much any single participant can post so the poster would have to carefully prepare what he wants to post and cannot post something, likely to be derogatory, in the heat of debate.\n\n \n Another crimp.

   "I'm not sure what this has to do with anything.\n\n \n I am merely illustrating why the previous restrictions on participation are needed. The 2 sword lengths in the House of Commons are meant to keep members of opposing political factions from coming to physical violence in the course of debate. No legislative assembly, political convention or debate club can function without imposed decorum. And if anyone and everyone can participate without limits, the process would collapse under the weight of the number of participants.\n \n As for what you see as a chosen few, is this not what every city council, county commission, school board and legislature in the county is based on, not to mention the U. S. House of Representatives and U. S. Senate? We live in a republic, not a democracy.\n \n And I note that due the fact that the body has 435 members, the U. S. House of Representatives places a limit not only on the amount of time that can be devoted to any given question, but also on how much time any given member can use to speak on that question.\n \n The unlimited free-for-all that you see as a benefit of an internet discussion I see as a severe restraint on the discussion's effectiveness.",
