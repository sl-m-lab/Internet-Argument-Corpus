   "What is a \"pro-lifer\"?\n Often pro-lifers are represented as being anti-abortion, which is only part of what we actually believe. We are opposed to any violation of the right to life which is part of the UN Convention on Human Rights and (more relevantly to the UK) the European Convention on Human Rights. \n \n The following sums up what pro-lifers believe:\n \n Abortion\n We do not believe that abortion should be available on demand. Unlike the United States, abortion is illegal under law in the UK. Exemption from prosecution is allowed under certain legal conditions ie the approval by two Doctors, which are generally flouted with impunity. Worse still, some Doctors who are opposed to abortion sign anyway simply because someone else will do it anyway.\n \n There is certainly no medical reason why it should ever be necessary. There are medical conditions,eg ectopic pregnancy, that without medical intervention will result in the probable death of the woman. These are extremely rare, cannot be deemed a normal pregnancy and operations in these cases have neither been illegal nor in question.\n \n The so called \"pro-choice\" movement is in fact in favour of only one choice, ie abortion. For example, a woman who telephones the \"British Pregnancy Advisory Service (sic)\" looking for help with a crisis pregnancy will not be given any help or advice. They only deal in abortions, performing over a quarter of all UK abortions. They will not even refer the woman to pro-life organisations such as Life. So much for choice!\n \n When the Abortion Act was introduced, it was stated that abortion would be rare. We are now seeing around 200,000 abortions per year. This means that the UK is now facing a population crisis which is even acknowledged by the UN Population Fund (who helped to get us in this mess in the first place). This crisis makes \"Euthanasia\" a more and more attractive option.\n \n Women are suffering physical and psychological damage from abortions. Some find it difficult to cope with having an abortion, knowing that they have ended a tiny defenceless life. Some are pressured into it. Some find themselves to be infertile afterwards. A small number die from it, which according to the WHOs own figures for the UK are statistically greater than the number of deaths before the Abortion Act, because far more abortions are taking place now than before the act. \n \n Some will find that they will get breast cancer in later life as a direct consequence of the abortion. 27 of 34 worldwide studies show a statistical link between breast cancer and abortion. The abortion \"industry\" as it has now become is extremely keen to play this down, being now more interested in the money they make from abortion than any concern for women's health. Once it is realised that abortion is not as safe as they say it is, their little empires will crumble.\n \n Embryo research\n We are opposed to all forms of embryo research, including so called \"Therapeutic cloning\". This is merely a backdoor to full reproductive cloning. The same process is required for both. There can be no justification for experimentation on humans at any stage of their development regardless of the \"possible\" benefits. There are other several other ways of finding stem cells for medical research that are not morally and ethically questionable.\n \n Euthanasia\n As has already been mentioned, the decline in birth rate (of which abortion is the major factor) is creating a population crisis. Most of Europe now has population growth below replacement levels, on average 1.4 births per couple compared to 2.1 just to keep the population stable.\n \n What this means is that the proportion of elderly people is increasing across Europe. For example, Italy now has more people over 60 than under 15. Germany recently announced financial incentives for women to have more children.\n \n In the last year for which figures are available, the UK population has remained stable mainly via immigration. \n \n Therefore the proportion of elderly people needing medical care is also increasing. No-one doubts that it would save the NHS a huge amount of money to actively terminate the lives of terminally ill people. However, this undermines the basic principles of health care enshrined in the Hippocratic Oath \"first do no harm\".\n \n Not very long ago Doctor Shipman from Hyde, Greater Manchester was imprisoned for 15 murders, but is alleged in fact to have killed around 200. This is an awful tragedy, which demonstrates that we cannot allow Doctors to kill their patients. For if it is possible for a Doctor to do this now when they can't kill their patients, how could we possibly control them if they can?\n \n The Dutch believe that they have done well in their allowing of Euthanasia, but people are being put to death without their permission, ie murdered. For example, over 1000 people were murdered by their Doctors in 1990. \n \n Furthermore, no-one need die in agony. Advances in medical technology mean that a person can be cared for right up to their death.\n \n Non-violence\n We are opposed to violence in any form. There are admittedly a fewgroups that believe that violence is part of the pro-life struggle, however this is a totally contradictory view to hold. These groups therefore are not and can not be considered to be \"pro-life\".",

So much for choice!\n Oh, you mean unlike the pro-life organizations that regularly refer women that come to them to pro-choice organizations? I'm being facetious, to get it out of my system, but seriously why would a \"pro-choice\" organization refer people to a \"pro-life\" organization when such organizations are regarded (rightly or wrongly) as \"pro-paternalism\"? \n \n The claim that \"the so called \"pro-choice movement is in fact in favour of only one choice\" is certainly a important criticism that the pro-choice movement faces, because it is about supporting a woman's choice to have an abortion. \n \n Unfortunately so much time and attention is devoted to protecting that choice that it overshadows the whole point of the pro-choice position: the woman's right to choose.\n \n Too little time and attention is spent protecting a woman's autonomy in making that choice or supporting a woman's choice not to have an abortion. \n \n Fortunately in Canada, where abortion is legal, the pro-choice movement is quickly recognizing that providing women with the information and support to make an informed decision either way is just as important as providing the means to exercise one choice.\n \n I'm pointing this out because I think you may be mistaking the pro-choice's struggle to keep the abortion option open with what the pro-choice movement is actually in favour of: the informed choice of a woman with regard to how she wants to deal with pregnancy.",

   "So? That's what you get for having a medical system built on a model of private enterprise. \n \n In Canada, where the doctors are on salary, we don't have the problem of doctors encouraging un-necessary elective surgery. \n \n Of course, considering the extra work-load that such an elective procedure puts on doctors, we have the problem of doctors discouraging un-necessary elective surgery where-ever possible. \n \n I think our problem is preferable, personally, because it allows for a better pro-choice environment.",
