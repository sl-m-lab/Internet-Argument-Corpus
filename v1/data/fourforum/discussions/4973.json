   "Neither. First of all, Bush is too socialist like most American republicans to actually get rid of it. Getting rid of it in any form will cost him votes, and no politican will do that. \n \n I think he's one, trying to give a kickback to the financial sector, two trying to reform it in the long run, and three further increasing the size of the government and deficit. A fisical conservative would raise taxes, cut benefits and slowly phase the entire thing out while implementing entirely, goverment free-private accounts. There's no way Bush is going to get rid of a cash cow. He like every other president before him sees SS as a polential fund to raid.",
