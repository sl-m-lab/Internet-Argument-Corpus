Man cannot serve God and money and the collectivism is only the start. When Jesus encourages people to be like the lillies of the field or the birds, and says 'tomorrow will take care of itself', this clearly shows a life closer to the wandering ascetics of India than established citizens with careers to manage. For much the same reason, he is prepared to break up the existing social order, telling people to leave their families and follow him.

We need to get everybody into world markets, and provide them with enough information and tools to create their own businesses. This means getting them on the Internet. The one organization working directly on this problem is One Laptop Per Child, http://laptop.org/, an education program. I am working on the next step, teaching children all over the world how to go into business together.\n \n As others point out in this thread, it is greed and selfishness that the Bible mainly condemns, not the possession of money or property. Jesus said to a rich man, \"Sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, and follow me.\" Excellent advice if your purpose is to learn as much as you can from Jesus, but terrible advice if your purpose is to help the poor.\n \n Anyway, capitalism is not a single theory or practice. One can have crony capitalism, as in the US currently, or competitive capitalism, in which companies have to follow the law and compete fairly, not spend most of their time looking for favors from the government. Competitive capitalism requires that everybody have equal access to the market, to market information, to technology, and so on, and that nobody have excessive, unregulated market power.

   "I think its pretty clear that in the OT the chosen of God are seen as wealthy and succesful. This is largely because for most of Jewish history there was no concept of an afterlife so a long and wealthy life was the way of showing God liked someone.\n\n \n That's an urban myth - that \"for most of Jewish history there was no concept of an afterlife.\" Let me show you why that's wrong:\n \n Jewish Rabbis, etc., on the Afterlife, the Resurrection, and Hell\n \n Reward & Punishment:\n \n What do the Rabbis teach about the concept of the good being rewarded and the evil being punished? What does that entail? Is it similar to what Christians believe? Is there such a thing as \"eternal hell\" in the Jewish Faith??\n \n Answer:\n \n One of the basic principles of Judaism is that God rewards those who obey His commands and punishes those who disobey. The primary place for both reward and punishment is the afterlife. It is, of course, nearly impossible for us to have any real idea what the actual nature of this reward and punishment is like. While I suspect that the basic idea is similar to that of Christianity, there are probably some important differences. I am not familiar, in any detail, with Christian theology on this point.\n Regarding \"eternal hell\", the Talmud teaches us that sinners are released from Hell (Gehinnom in Hebrew) after 12 months (Eduyos 2:10). There are, however, some exceptions to this rule in cases of extreme wickedness where the punishment is truly eternal (Talmud Rosh HaShana 17a).\n \n Hometown Has Been Shutdown - People Connection Blog: AIM Community Network\n \n From Rabbi Yaakov Feldman (Torah.org)\n \n There are two facets of the afterlife: &#8220;Gan Eden&#8221;, and &#8220;Gehenom&#8221;. Gan Eden (which translates as &#8220;The Garden of Eden&#8221; since it&#8217;s the spiritual counterpart of the earthly Garden depicted in Genesis) is where the soul delights in G-d. And Gehenom (which is usually taken to be &#8220;hell&#8221; but is actually different) is where the soul suffers the consequences of its misdeeds.\n \n Understand of course that the consequences the soul suffers in Gehenom are spiritual in nature. After all, the body is buried in the ground, so anything that happens after death is non-physical. The sort of &#8220;pain&#8221; the soul suffers in Gehenom can best be depicted as an existential anguish and mortal discomfit brought on by catching sight of oneself for the first time. \n \n Torah.org - The Judaism Site\n \n Rabbis Meir and Levi &#8211; Afterlife in the Torah\n \n Rabbi Meir said: Where can we see that resurrection is derived from the Torah? In the passage: \"Then will Moses and the children of Israel sing this song to the Lord [Exodus 15:1]. It does not say \"sang\" but rather \"will sing\". Therefore, resurrection is deducible from the Torah. Again, Rabbi Joshua b. Levi asked: \"Where can we see that resurrection is derived from the Torah? In the passage Happy are those who dwell in Your house, they will be still praising you [Psalm 84:5]; it is not stated \"they have praised You\" but rather \"will be praising You\"; therefore, resurrection is derived from the Torah [i.e. Psalms]. [Babylonian Talmud, tractate Sanhedrin 91b]\n \n http://www.scheinerman.net/judaism/ideas/afterlife.html\n \n Heaven and Hell in Judaism\n \n &#8220;Yes, there is a Jewish concept of heaven where we will all be together with God. Yes, there is a concept of Hell where those who have done evil things will be punished (for no more than 11 months maximum).&#8221;\n \n http://www10.brinkster.com/butlerd/westjudFAQ.html\n \n Isaiah and Hell? \n \n Isaiah 14:9-17 seems to describe a conscious torment of those \n who are judged in Sheol, with other conscious beings there mocking them. It \n refers to maggots and worms (14:11)&#8230;..Ezek 32:24,30 describes \"shame\" of the wicked judged, though it might be metaphorical. The common OT motif of \n being delivered from Sheol or the \"pit\" (e.g., 1 Sam 2:6, Ps 16:10, 71:20, \n Hos 13:14) implies that the righteous were conscious there, and so by \n extension, one might assume the wicked were also conscious, but not \n delivered.\n \n Samuel as a Spirit\n \n The king said to her, \"Have no fear; what do you see?\" And the woman said to Saul, \"I see a god (elohim) coming up out of the earth.\" He said to her, \"What is his appearance?\" And she said, \"An old man wrapped in a robe.\" And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance. Then Samuel said to Saul, \"Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?\" (I Sam. 28:13-15)\n \n Hell not a Christian Invention!\n \n &#8220;&#8230;the first Rabbinic utterances come to us from the time immediately \n before that of Christ, from the Schools of Shammai and Hillel (Rosh haSh. 16 b last four lines, and 17 a).2 The former arranged all mankind into three classes: the perfectly righteous, who are 'immediately written and sealed to eternal life;' the perfectly wicked, who are 'immediately written and sealed to Gehenna;' and an intermediate class. 'who go down to Gehinnom, and moan, and come up again,' according to Zech. xiii. 9, and which seemed also indicated in certain words in the Song of Hannah (1 Sam. ii. 6). The careful reader will notice that this statement implies belief in Eternal Punishment on the partof the School of Shammai. For (1) The perfectly wicked are spoken of as 'written and sealed unto Gehenna;'\n \n http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ304.HTM\n \n Gehinnom (g'hee-NOHM); Gehenna (g'HEHN-uh) \n \n A place of spiritual punishment and/or purification for a period of up to 12 months after death. Gehinnom is the Hebrew name; Gehenna is Yiddish. \n \n Judaism - Glossary of Jewish Terminology\n \n Resurrection in the Torah\n \n Rabbi Simai says: How do we know that the resurrection of the dead can be derived from the Torah? From the verse, &#8220;I also established My covenant with them [i.e., Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob], to give them the land of Canaan&#8221; (Exod. 6: 4), &#8220;To you&#8221; is not written but &#8220;to them.&#8221; Hence, resurrection of the dead can be derived from the Torah (b. Sanh. 90b).\n \n http://www.ctinquiry.org/publications/reflections_volume_6/levenson.htm\n \n Rabbi Maimonedes &#8211; Afterlife in the Torah\n \n \"Resurrection of the dead is one of the fundamental\n principles in the Torah of our master Moses.&#8221;\n \n http://www.joshuah.org/Steps/Articles/THIRTEEN%20ARTICLES%20OF%20FAITH.htm\n \n Afterlife in the Torah as Taught by Jesus\n \n &#8220;Jesus replied, \"You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. But about the resurrection of the dead--have you not read what God said to you, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\" Matthew 22:29-32\n \n Then what about the 23rd Psalm, where David says, \"And I shall dwell in the House of the Lord forever.\" \n \n Hell in Daniel chapter 12:1-2? \n \n \"There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people&#8212;everyone whose name is found written in the book&#8212;will be delivered. 2 Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.\" \n \n So, where is this place where people will experience \"shame and everlasting contempt\"?\n \n Isaiah confirms an afterlife:\n \n \"The dead shall live, the dead bodies shall arise -- awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust -- for Thy dew is as the dew of light, and the earth shall bring to life the shades.\" - Isaiah 26:19\n \n See link for more.\n \n What is the View in the Tanakh of Death and the Afterlife?",
