   "The Documentary Hypothesis of the Torah emerged in the 1890's, the product of a group of German biblical scholars led by Julius Wellhausen. The DH is today accepted by all but the most conservative of Bible scholars.\n\n \n <chuckle< \n \n Gutting the Documentary Hypothesis \n \n http://www.geocities.com/k9ocu/DH.htm \n \n \"To sum up, it is very doubtful whether the Wellhausen (Documentary) hypothesis is entitled to the status of scientific respectability. There is so much of special pleading, circular reasoning, questionable deductions from unsubstantiated premises, that it is absolutely certain that its methodology would never stand up in a court of law. Scarcely any of the laws of evidence respected in legal proceedings are honored by the architects of this documentary theory. Any attorney who attempted to interpret a will or statute or deed of conveyance in the bizarre and irresponsible fashion of the source critics of the Pentateuch would find his case thrown out of court without delay [Archer, pages 108-109..].\" \n \n a priori anti-supernatural bias alleged  \n \n \"The documentary theory has been characterized by a subtle species of circular reasoning; it tends to posit its conclusion (the Bible is no supernatural revelation) as its underlying premise (there can be no such thing as supernatural revelation) [Archer, page 105].\" \n \n a priori anti-supernatural bias admitted \n \n \"The German scholar Frank (Geshichte und Kritik der Neuren Theologie, p. 289) gives this exact summary of the presuppositions maintained by the documentary hypothesis: 'The representation of a course of history is a priori to be regarded as untrue and unhistorical if supernatural factors interpose in it [New Evidence, page 355].\" \n \n Lack of Historical and Archaeological Evidence \n \n \"Bruce K. Waltke, Ph.D., Harvard University and Fellow of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, states firmly: 'Though one who has read only the popular literature advancing the conclusions of the literary analytical approach might not realize it, even the most ardent advocate of the theory must admit that we have as yet not a single scrap of tangible, external evidence for either the existence or the history of the sources J, E, D, P. [W. F. Albright, The Archeology of Palestine, revised, Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1960, pages 2, quoted by New Evidence, page 528, underlining added].'\" \n \n \n http://www.aomin.org/JEDP.html see below for info from this link\n \n \n What is undeniable, however, is that the foundation of the documentary hypothesis is heavily influenced by naturalistic, humanistic philosophy. Orr reports the view of Keunen, who stated that the religion of Israel is one of many religions, and not anything more; this is, apparently, the view of \"modern theological science.\"17 In his work, Prophets and Prophecy in Israel, Keunen states:\n \n So soon as we derive a separate part of Israel's religious life directly from God, and allow the supernatural or immediate revelation to intervene in even one single point, so long also our view of the whole continues to be incorrect... It is the supposition of a natural development alone which accounts for all the phenomena.18 \n In other words, the moment one admits the intervention of special revelation or the supernatural into the study of the Israel's religious history, it is at that moment that one is guaranteed to come up with erroneous results. It is only by considering religious history along natural processes of development that one is, according to Keunen, guaranteed to come up with satisfactory results. \n \n Deuteronomy Source:\n \n James Orr, writing at the beginning of the twentieth century, raises some very simple yet compelling questions with regard to the liberal theory. For example, how could the priest present to the king a book purporting to be of Mosaic origin when, so to speak, the ink is still wet? Surely such a modern work would not have the look of antiquity and the king, unless he was extremely dull-witted, would not be deceived by such a clear forgery. Also, the text of 2 Kings 22 indicates an awareness of this book's existence, and the recognition of its authority when it was read. If this book were a novel invention, surely it would not have received such an eager hearing, and be recognized as the book of the law?60 \n \n Against the theory of a seventh-century origin for Deuteronomy, Harrison points out that Deuteronomy does, in fact, fit the situation of Israel on the brink of entering the Promised Land. The Israelites were about to enter a land that was under Canaanite rule, and the influence of Canaanite religion would be strong. For this reason, the Lord commanded Israel to destroy all traces of Canaanite worship, so that the pure worship of the Lord would not be tainted by pagan rituals (Deuteronomy 7, and 12, for example).63 The Deuteronomic legislation is clearly preparatory (notice the language in 18:9; 19:1; and 26:1, for example). It is surely presumption to assume that this cannot be the case; only by denying the supernatural and asserting the evolutionary view could one doubt that this legislation was given to Moses to establish the religious framework of the people once they had settled in Canaan. \n \n Critique of multiple authors:\n \n From the outset, it should be stated that it is inconsistent with the testimony of the Old Testament texts themselves to deny that sources have been used, and that people other than the main author of the books worked on the texts. The problem that most conservatives have with the liberal approach is not that the liberal appeals to sources; it is that they appeal to hypothetical sources. 81 Numbers 21:14 refers to the Book of the Wars of the Lord; 2 Samuel 1:18 refers to the book of Jashar; 1 Kings 11:41 refers to the book of the acts of Solomon. Clearly, sources were being used in the composition of these books. Sources, however, neither deny antiquity, nor do they deny authorship.",

   "Actually, Orion is correct. There are two different creation stories. If read carefully, they cannot be reconciled. I know that some people who claim that the Bible must be read literally interpret the two stories to be somehow the same, but they aren't and Biblical scholars state that they aren't. One of the creation myths is Sumerian and the other is Babylonian.\n \n As for claims that Moses wrote the first 5 books of the Torah, it is idiocy. If that were the case, wouldn't it be logical the Moses would have used the same word to refer to God? Instead, he used at least two - thus the Yahwist and the Elohist traditions of Biblical authorship. But that isn't the only reason that multiple authors are believed to have written the Torah. The writing style, vocabulary, word usage and grammar varies from chapter to chapter, and even within a single chapter, making it evident that the first books of the Bible had more than one author.\n \n The idea that Moses is the author of the Pentatuech is an idea that is peculiar to American Fundamentalist and Evangelical Christians. These views are not held by the majority of Christians nor Jewish Biblical scholars.\n \n One reason, by the way, that it is nonsense to claim that Moses wrote the first 5 books of the Bible is that he would have had to record his own death if that were true.\n \n Orion is correct in his Biblical scholarship is asserting that there are for literary traditions in the Pentateuch. Here is a quote from the second paragraph of the \"Introductions to the Books of the Old Testament\" from my family Bible.\n \nThe grandeur of this historic sweep [of the Pentateuch] is the result of a careful and complex joining of several historical traditions, or sources. These are primarily four: the so-called Yahwist, Elohist, Priestly and Deuteronomic strands that run through the Pentateuch. (They are conveniently abbreviated as J, E, P and D).\n\n \n In the first two chapters of Genesis, the traditions were recorded separately, thus there are two creation stories that are quite different and beyond reconcillation. With the story of Noah, the case it different. Two different traditions were intermingled. That is why there is so much repitition. There is also uncertainty about how many of each species (kind) were brought aboard the ark. One story was that there were two of each \"kind,\" while the Priestly tradition was concerned with clean and unclean animals and which could be eaten and/or sacrificed. Thus, the Priestly tradition of the story was to include \"7 of each kind.\" It isn't clear if that is 7 pairs or 7 animals total. If any one who can figure it out by reading Genesis, I would appreciate hearing your reasoning in the matter. I have read the Bible from cover to cover and I have read major parts of it in several translations and in three languages. I spent an entire academic year reading the Bible with a Ph.D. Bible scholar who was the first to explain all of the above to me, even though it is also explained in the introduction that I quoted.\n \n But isn't it funny that zachvac made a reference to the story of Noah and HeavenBound responds that she doesn't \"...have the time to rewrite the story of Moses.\" It seems that HeavenBound isn't all that familiar with the Bible.\n \n What is even funnier is HeavenBound's assertion that \"There were no laws of physics in Joshua's time.\" Are we then to believe that items released in mid air remained there? They didn't fall to earth? How did the walls of Jericho fall in that case? Are we to believe that items placed over a fire didn't get hot, as the laws of thermodynamics indicate? There is evidence that Neantertals and Cro-Magnons cooked food. How did they accomplish that? When exactly did the laws of physics begin to opperate.\n \n I'll tell you what science thinks. The laws of physics, as we know them, began to operate about 13.7 billion years ago, at a point about 10E-38 seconds after the initial beginning of the expansion of our universe, sometimes called the big bang. But that is one of the assumptions of science that creationists reject. Science assumes that the natural forces we observe in the universe today are the same forces that have been in effect since the beginning. Thus, Joshua was subject to gravity and he probably suffered from more than one cold.",

   "OK, so I have finally gotten HeavenBound to agree that Noah was on an ark (with family members as corrected) and 2 of each animal. The wood was ordinary gopher wood and the rain was ordinary wood and God didn't bend the laws of physics, only seal the ark. Now it only rained 40 days and nights.

The highest elevation on Mt. Everest is 29035 ft. Now one can hardly argue that \"the heavens\" is below where we can walk but let's just assume that \"the heavens\" only refers to 14,000 feet. Spread over 40 days we get 350 feet per day. We consider 5 inches in a day to be a downpour. But that's 14.58 feet/hour and 2.9 inches/minute. Do you know how fast that is? If we call 29035 \"the heavens\" we get 725.9 feet/day, 30.2 feet/hour and 2.52 feet/minute. Can you imagine that? In 3 minutes the rain would be over your head.

Imagine the worst downpour you've ever had to drive home in with the winshield wipers going full blast and still only seeing 5 feet ahead of you. That was probably about 5 inches of rain that day. The flood was 72 times worse than that by these calculations assuming \"to the heavens\" meant the tip of mount Everest. 72 times worse than the worst rainstorm you've ever seen.

It rained for 40 days and 40 nights in a row and Noah along with 2 creratures of each species/animal (doesn't really matter) on board. The ark was made out of human wood, not wood God gave Noah. God didn't do anything special to the rain or the ark, just made ordinary rain for an extraordinarily long time.\n\n Correct. It did rain 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was made of a very bouyant wood that was available to Noah. God created the conditions of the rain, which at the time was the first time rain had fallen to earth (before that it was a very heavy mist that watered the soils of the ground). It was not an ordinary rainfall, it was a torrential rainfall.\n2. Joshua stopped the sun and no other laws of physics were changed.\n\n No. God stopped the earths rotation for 24 hours. There is a paradoxal missing day which scientists have yet to figure out (I believe it to be from this event).\n \n The ark would also have withstood the pressures of the rain and wind because of the way it was built and bouyancy of the wood used to build the ship.

I don't know how to interpret that but there are many mountains in Colorado that are 14,000 feet. The highest elevation on Mt. Everest is 29035 ft. Now one can hardly argue that \"the heavens\" is below where we can walk but let's just assume that \"the heavens\" only refers to 14,000 feet. Spread over 40 days we get 350 feet per day. We consider 5 inches in a day to be a downpour. But that's 14.58 feet/hour and 2.9 inches/minute. Do you know how fast that is? If we call 29035 \"the heavens\" we get 725.9 feet/day, 30.2 feet/hour and 2.52 feet/minute. Can you imagine that? In 3 minutes the rain would be over your head. Do you know how much force that must have put on the ark? There's no way it would have stayed afloat in such a downpour. I'm sure if we really got into it with raindrop size and distance from the clouds we could determine the speed of the raindrops, but I think you get the picture. Imagine the worst downpour you've ever had to drive home in with the winshield wipers going full blast and still only seeing 5 feet ahead of you. That was probably about 5 inches of rain that day. The flood was 72 times worse than that by these calculations assuming \"to the heavens\" meant the tip of mount Everest. 72 times worse than the worst rainstorm you've ever seen. And you expect gopher wood to stay floating and not\n \n 1. sink\n or 2. Split apart from the pressure of the rain.\n\n Could the Water Cover Mt. Everest? \n Mount Everest is more than 5 miles (8 kilometers) high. How, then, could the flood have covered \"all the high hills under the whole heaven?\" \n The Bible refers only to \"high hills,\" and the mountains today were formed only toward the end of, and after, the flood by collision of the tectonic plates and the associated upthrusting. In support of this, the layers that form the uppermost parts of Mount Everest are themselves composed of fossil-bearing, water-deposited layers. \n This uplift of the new continental landmasses from under the Flood waters would have meant that, as the mountains rose and the valleys sank, the waters would have rapidly drained off the newly emerging land surfaces. The collapse of natural dams holding back the flood waters on the land would also have caused catastrophic flooding. Such rapid movement of large volumes of water would have caused extensive erosion and shaped the basic features of today's earth surface.",

   "There is a paradoxal missing day which scientists have yet to figure out (I believe it to be from this event).\n\n To be scientifically illiterate is one thing. To be so gullible that one is willing to believe any story, no matter how unlikely and improbable, is quite another. Did it ever cross your mind to actually think about this story before posting it? Wouldn't it have been a good idea to check it out a bit? See Answers in Genesis.\n \n It did rain 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was made of a very bouyant wood that was available to Noah.\n\n But was it boyant enough to stay afloat for the whole year of the flood? How did 8 people take care of all of those animals? Why didn't the fumes from the pitch (inside and out) kill most of the animals? Why didn't the amonia from the urine kill all of the animals in the lower decks? How did the air get down there? And so on.\n \nThe ark would also have withstood the pressures of the rain and wind because of the way it was built and bouyancy of the wood used to build the ship.\n\n There's a couple of problems. The largest wooden ships were just over 300 ft in length. There were 9 six masted schooners built between 1900 and 1909. They leaked from the day they hit the water because even a gentle swell caused hogging and snaking that sprung the hull timbers beyond any known method of calking - most certainly beyond a simple slathering with pitch. There was also another ship of comparable length, the four-masted medium clipper barque, Great Republic built in 1853. The latter had 90 steel cross braces, 4 inches wide, 1 inch thick and 336 feet long. She still leaked. Most of these ships were lost in storms, even while anchored in the lee of an island.\n \n But that isn't even the full extent of the bad news. Any experienced sailor will tell you how important it is that a ship maintain headway during a storm in order to keep the attitude of the ship oriented to the waves correctly. Sailing ships had to fly at least some sail so that they could keep the stern to the wave front. Modern ships put bow into the waves. The reasons are simple. A ship without power (or a big box like an ark) would get turned broadside to the waves, a disaster in heavy seas. If the height of the wave front is greater than the dimension of the ship, then as the wave begins to pass and the ship is carried up the wave, before it reaches the top it will slide down the face into the trough where the gunwale will be driven under. As the wave passes, it will roll the ship. In 1944 four ships of the U.S. Navy lost power during a typhoon in the Pacific and capcized when the waves turned them with their beams to the waves.\n \n Now consider that creationists propose that tectonic activity raised mountains some miles during the flood. Just think of what a little tectonic activity recently did in the Indian Ocean and then imagine what sort of waves Noah's little ark would have had to endure - on and on for a year. But you can go ahead and believe that mythology is history if you want.\n \nMost animals as a protection against sharp temperature and other climatological changes, is the ability to suspend all bodily functions in a state of hibernation.\n\n Don't let the actual facts confuse you.

   "First, I didn't know we were arguing about Creationist beliefs, these are Christian beliefs referred too here.\n\n Nope. What is being discussed is creationist beliefs. Creationists make up a minority of Christians, most usually in the U.S. - especially the south. Several polls (by Gallup for example) have consistently shown that creationists are typically less educated than average. For quite obvious reasons, the more educated a person is the less likely he is to be a creationist. Along with that lack of education goes the fact that creationists tend to be less afluent than non-creationists. They also tend to be employed at manual or menial jobs, rural, southern, and female.\n \n Gallup, who is himself a born again Christian, commented on how unhappy he was with his own findings.\n \n About salt-water fish not being able to adapt quickly to fresh water you said,\n \nYou don't know that. Prove it.\n\n Been there, done that. I have known several people who kept fish (my son for one), both fresh water and salt water. All of them are especially sensative to the chemical makeup of the water. Usually people start out with fresh water fish, and after killing a few tank fulls learn the necessary skills to have some success with salt water fish. Great care must be exercised that the salinity of the water is exactly right - using sea salt, of course. That is in addition to amonia that tends to accumulate and kill expensive fish. That doesn't even count the clorine in tap water that can kill your fish in a matter of minutes. No. Clearly a reduction in the levels of salt in the ocean would have killed most living organisms with only a few exceptions.",

Most salt water animals die within hours or days in fresh or brine water (don't believe me? Try go down to your local pet store and ask them how long salt water fish last in freshwater tanks and vice versa). Same goes for fresh water marine life. A significent change in the salinity or pressure (which is affected by salinity) could cause mass die offs, if not extinction of entire species.\n\n \n You don't know if they were or were not capable of this back then. \n \n \nAside from more weak dues ex machina arguments, how did vegetation grow in such a short period of time in very hostile soil? Not to mention many species of plants require fire to break shell, or many have their seeds unprotected, and we simply cannot forget about the hundreds that require polentators. How do you explain that?\n\n \n Not all vegetation needs or takes a long time to grow. How do you think vegetation grew in the first place? Perhaps the ones that required pollenators didn't grow until the bee, wasp, and yellow jacket etc. population replenished themselves. \n \n \nI'm not trying to convert you, I'm trying to get you to realize literal flood beliefs are completely ludacrious.

Until you do that you will never understand. God is so much bigger than all your logic and scientific data. To me your the one that seems illogical and ignorant. Seeing and believing something is easy that's why it brings more joy to God when we believe without seeing him. When proof was presented in the human form of Jesus Christ, people obviously didn't believe him either. They saw all the miracles he performed and still crucified him.

   "My God is male in spiritual terms only, of course my God doesn't have a material body.\n\n \n But as has been pointed out to you, gender is a biological characteristic. The fact that ancient societies conferred maleness upon their gods seems to me to be nothing more than a reflection of cultural bias. For example, the Hebrews were a patriarchal society, so it made perfect sense for them to attribute maleness to their god. Some societies viewed the earth as being female, in consort with a male sky-god. Rain was thus considered to be the semen of the sky-god, which caused plants to pop out of the ground. \n \n Likewise, the god of the Hebrews lived somewhere in the sky above the earth. You find references to this throughout the entire Judeo/Christian Bible. Genesis 11 tells us that God looked down and came down in order to check out the tower of Babel. Jesus is reported to have ascended into the sky, bodily, toward heaven. This assumes that heaven exists as some physical location in the sky. Likewise, Paul tells us that Jesus would soon return to earth from the sky, through the clouds, to gather up the faithful and to bring them back to heaven with him. \n \n I'm not trying to challenge your views on these subjects, but I am attempting to get you to think through them.",

If I find my article on carbon dating, I guarantee I'll be back. Who said I lost the Ark debate? I never tried to prove evolution wrong. Where are you getting your facts from??? The only one hurt is you. :p \n \n I obviously must know something if I lasted this long.\n\n You lost the ark debate because you never presented any real evidence for it except for \"God said so\" and when presented with what we thought were impossibilities instead of reasons why it worked it was \"God said he did, so he did it somehow.\" And proving evolution wrong has nothing to do with the ark debate. And you ask him where he's getting his facts from? At least he has facts.

   "But Jim,\n \n If this great flood killed everyone in the world but 8 people on a little ark, and if we find their story in the Bible, who invented all of these other flood stories. Isn't it more reasonable that since so few tell the same story as the Bible, that they recount different flood mythology? Isn't it reasonable that since mankind has always had a proclivity for settling on floodplains the the vast majority of these myths relate to local floods.\n \n However, there is no evidence in the geology of the earth that there ever was a universal flood. There isn't enough water on earth to raise water levels high enough to cover even low mountain ranges, much less flood to a depth greater than Everest. But the \"something\" to the story is that many primative people suffered floods and incorporated stories about them into their oral traditions and mythology.\n \nIt's also amazing how so many of you think science and laws of nature should preclude miracles. I call that lack of faith.\n\n Exactly. If we can explain the things that happen in the world around us by naturalistic means, why should we throw are hands up into the air and give up and declare a miracle? Faith means to believe without evidence.\n \nDon't try to tell me nothing like that ever happened.\n\n Nobody is telling you that there have never been floods. But there is no evidence of a universal flood. Looking at the geology of the earth, fossil lakes and rivers, and even deserts are quite apparent. Any geologist recognizes them when he sees them in the strata. And floods are also quite apparent. But there is not layer that is found everywhere around the globe that could possible correspond to a universal flood.",

Combine that with the fact that human settlement is generally located along waterways or coastlines, and it's not hard to see how flooding could easily become a part of mythology for most cultures around the world. It's a powerful force of nature, yet relatively common.\n \n To suggest that every story is talking about the same flood at the same time is rather absurd IMHO.\n \n Waxy",

(Most do not give a reason.) \n who survived. (Almost none have only a family of eight surviving.) \n what they took with them. (Very few saved samples of all life.) \n how they survived. (In about half the myths, people escaped to high ground; some flood myths have no survivors.) \n what they did afterwards. (Few feature any kind of sacrifice after the flood.) \n The biblical flood myth has close parallels only to other myths from the same region, with which it probably shares a common source, and to versions spread to other cultures by missionaries (Isaak 2002). \n \n \n Flood myths oare likely common because floods are common; the commonness of the myth in no way implies a global flood.

   "But Jim,\n \n If this great flood killed everyone in the world but 8 people on a little ark, and if we find their story in the Bible, who invented all of these other flood stories. Isn't it more reasonable that since so few tell the same story as the Bible, that they recount different flood mythology? Isn't it reasonable that since mankind has always had a proclivity for settling on floodplains the the vast majority of these myths relate to local floods.\n \n However, there is no evidence in the geology of the earth that there ever was a universal flood. There isn't enough water on earth to raise water levels high enough to cover even low mountain ranges, much less flood to a depth greater than Everest. But the \"something\" to the story is that many primative people suffered floods and incorporated stories about them into their oral traditions and mythology.\n \n Exactly. If we can explain the things that happen in the world around us by naturalistic means, why should we throw are hands up into the air and give up and declare a miracle? Faith means to believe without evidence.\n \n Nobody is telling you that there have never been floods. But there is no evidence of a universal flood. Looking at the geology of the earth, fossil lakes and rivers, and even deserts are quite apparent. Any geologist recognizes them when he sees them in the strata. And floods are also quite apparent. But there is not layer that is found everywhere around the globe that could possible correspond to a universal flood.\nUnless I slipped up somewhere, I don't believe I claimed a single universal flooding of the earth happened. It wasn't until several hundred years AD that we knew the earth was a ball. Local or regional flooding may have been recounted as global flooding because the writers knew nothing of the rest of the world.\n \n Who knows...maybe a monstrous asteroid passed between the earth and the sun, causing the darkness and pulling the oceans waters to one side of the earth...maybe Noah's area was facing the sun and the sea waters rose (in response to gravity) while it was raining, causing the earth to be covered with water on one side.\n \n Since water is such a powerful part of life everywhere on the earth, it should be expected that some story related to a great flood would come from most all parts of the world.",
