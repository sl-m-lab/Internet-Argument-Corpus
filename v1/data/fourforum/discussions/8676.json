   "I have been having an some intresting pm messages lately. IT seems that JP Sartre12's daughter is getting married. I asked him to give me a good reason I shouldn't show up on tyhe wedding day and protest the wedding. \n \n Jp is one of the anti gay marriage marrige supporters in my state of Michigan. He has backed and voted for the the michigan marriage admendment. He has stated that it is the people right to vote on such matters as seems to be the Consensus of the conservative posters here. Then by all right I do conceede this point that yes the voters have a right in a democracy to vote on matters and JP has used his protcected right to do so. Now I also have a protected right of free speech and assembly. Which means that my right of protest is protected. When I bring this matter up that I have a constitutionally protected right to prostest his daughters wedding he threatens me with violence. \n \n So the question is\n \n Why should I not use my constitutionally protected rights to protest the weddings of the anti gay people and their children that put the marriage amendment on the ballot and those who voted for it?",

Being disruptive in this way is wrong. It's wrong when they do it, and it would be wrong for you to do it. When they do it it effects everyone's perception of the anti-gay crowd, making them all seem a bit less tolerant and a bit more hateful. If you do the same thing then you're giving them something to use against gays as a gift. You'ld be giving them ammo which they could use against those who want to help the cause of gay rights.",

The most relevant change for this discussion occurred when the government started handing out marriage licenses, and giving legal benefits to married people. At that point marriage became two very different things. It was then both a sacred act and a legal state at the same time. And I'm afraid it's too late to seperate them. I think only allowing churches to marry people and having governments only perform civil unions would make many people happy, but from a pracitcal point of view I don't see it happening.
