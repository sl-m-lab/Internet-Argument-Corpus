   "John Kerry outlined his plan for Iraq if he were President right now.\n Excerpted from the speech at NYU:\n \n First, the President has to get the promised international support so our men and women in uniform don't have to go it alone. It is late; the President must respond by moving this week to gain and regain international support. \n ...\n The President should convene a summit meeting of the world's major powers and Iraq's neighbors, this week, in New York, where many leaders will attend the U.N. General Assembly. He should insist that they make good on that U.N. resolution. He should offer potential troop contributors specific, but critical roles, in training Iraqi security personnel and securing Iraq's borders. He should give other countries a stake in Iraq's future by encouraging them to help develop Iraq's oil resources and by letting them bid on contracts instead of locking them out of the reconstruction process. \n \n This will be difficult. I and others have repeatedly recommended this from the very beginning. Delay has made only made it harder. After insulting allies and shredding alliances, this President may not have the trust and confidence to bring others to our side in Iraq. But we cannot hope to succeed unless we rebuild and lead strong alliances so that other nations share the burden with us. That is the only way to succeed. \n \n Second, the President must get serious about training Iraqi security forces. \n \n Last February, Secretary Rumsfeld claimed that more than 210,000 Iraqis were in uniform. Two weeks ago, he admitted that claim was exaggerated by more than 50 percent. Iraq, he said, now has 95,000 trained security forces.\n \n But guess what? Neither number bears any relationship to the truth. For example, just 5,000 Iraqi soldiers have been fully trained, by the administration's own minimal standards. And of the 35,000 police now in uniform, not one has completed a 24-week field-training program. Is it any wonder that Iraqi security forces can&#146;t stop the insurgency or provide basic law and order?\n \n The President should urgently expand the security forces training program inside and outside Iraq. He should strengthen the vetting of recruits, double classroom training time, and require follow-on field training. He should recruit thousands of qualified trainers from our allies, especially those who have no troops in Iraq. He should press our NATO allies to open training centers in their countries. And he should stop misleading the American people with phony, inflated numbers. \n \n Third, the President must carry out a reconstruction plan that finally brings tangible benefits to the Iraqi people.\n \n Last week, the administration admitted that its plan was a failure when it asked Congress for permission to radically revise spending priorities in Iraq. It took 17 months for them to understand that security is a priority. 17 months to figure out that boosting oil production is critical. 17 months to conclude that an Iraqi with a job is less likely to shoot at our soldiers.\n \n One year ago, the administration asked for and received $18 billion to help the Iraqis and relieve the conditions that contribute to the insurgency. Today, less than a $1 billion of those funds have actually been spent. I said at the time that we had to rethink our policies and set standards of accountability. Now we're paying the price. \n \n Now, the President should look at the whole reconstruction package draw up a list of high visibility, quick impact projects and cut through the red tape. He should use more Iraqi contractors and workers, instead of big corporations like Halliburton. He should stop paying companies under investigation for fraud or corruption. And he should fire the civilians in the Pentagon responsible for mismanaging the reconstruction effort.\n \n Fourth, the President must take immediate, urgent, essential steps to guarantee the promised elections can be held next year. \n \n Credible elections are key to producing an Iraqi government that enjoys the support of the Iraqi people and an assembly to write a Constitution that yields a viable power sharing arrangement. \n \n Because Iraqis have no experience holding free and fair elections, the President agreed six months ago that the U.N. must play a central role. Yet today, just four months before Iraqis are supposed to go to the polls, the U.N. Secretary General and administration officials themselves say the elections are in grave doubt. Because the security situation is so bad&#133; and because not a single country has offered troops to protect the U.N. elections mission&#133; the U.N. has less than 25 percent of the staff it needs in Iraq to get the job done.\n \n The President should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a U.N. protection force. This won't be easy. But even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in Iraq should still help protect the U.N. We should also intensify the training of Iraqis to manage and guard the polling places that need to be opened. Otherwise, U.S forces would end up bearing those burdens alone. \n\n \n Full text of the speech here\n \n My thoughts:\n With the exception of internationalization, all of these proposals are quite similar to what President Bush has said we need to do. The difference is that Bush has failed to achieve any degree of success in any one of these. At the point where both candidates agree on what needs to be done in Iraq, and one candidate has already proven himself incapable to pull it off, isn't that a prima facia reason to vote for the other candidate?\n \n I'm curious as to several points. 1) How can Bush attack Kerry for merely proposing to implement the same programs Bush himself has advocated? 2) What are the flaws in Kerry's plan, and how do the Bush proposals rectify them? 3) On the same vein, what the hell is Bush's plan for Iraq?\n \n The obvious riposte to at least some of this is that Bush plans to \"stay the course\" in Iraq, while Kerry will cut and run at the first oppurtunity. The problem with this is that according Conservative Columnist Extraordinare Robert Novak, President Bush is planning to withdraw US troops as soon as possible after the 2004 election, preferably within the year. Demonstrating the amazing Conservative capacity for Orwellian double-speak, Novak also tries to redefine the word \"resolute\" in this context:\n \nGetting out now would not end expensive U.S. reconstruction of Iraq, and certainly would not stop the fighting. Without U.S. troops, the civil war cited as the worst-case outcome by the recently leaked National Intelligence Estimate would be a reality. It would then take a resolute president to stand aside while Iraqis battle it out.\n\n Wow...that's really resolute, allowing Iraq to collapse into a brutal civil war that will likely destroy any chance for democracy in Iraq and almost definitely will cause an uptick in terrorism. And here I thought it was staying in hotzones--even when there is a risk of American casualties--in order to make America and the world more secure.\n Kerry, by contrast, appears to be projecting a US withdrawal in four years. Is that long enough to get the job done? Possibly...but Kerry also placed this withdrawal in the context of achieving his four-prong Iraq plan, rather than the other way around. Kerry's plan is to withdraw once we finish our job, Bush's is to withdraw and hope that our job's been finished by then.\n Furthermore, even if you believe that Bush is going to stick with the \"get tough\" approach (which still only places him even with Kerry in terms of his resoluteness on Iraq), he STILL has acted in a manner that shows how weak-kneed he is on Iraq.Matthew Yglesias explains:\n \n Bush has adopted policies designed to keep the death count low, primarily by avoiding ground combat in the Sunni triangle. Good campaign tactics, needless to say, but, as ever, the Bush team seems better at winning elections than winning wars. By delaying any assault on the wily Salafi terrorists...lurking in Fallujah, Samarra, Ramadi, and Baquba until after November, we give them more time to dig in, prepare defenses, and strengthen their forces before the attack. \n \n An important point comes next, so it gets a paragraph of its own: This plan will get people killed. If an assault is to be mounted, it should be done as soon as possible, before the adversary has been given months to prepare for it. The Marines and soldiers serving in Iraq volunteered for the military, but they've been conscripted into the Bush campaign. Decisions, as Lieutenant General James Conway recently stated, are being made on the basis of narrow political considerations rather than military ones. It's appropriate for generals to be subordinate to civilian politicians, but not to civilian campaign strategists. We're waging war as an extension of an electoral campaign, exposing our soldiers to harassing attacks right now and to a more difficult fight later on in order to help secure the president's re-election. \n\n President Bush, indefensibly, is subordinating necessary military actions in Iraq to his domestic political concerns. This is inexcusable, and it certainly harms Bush's credentials as someone who will take a stand, polls be damnned.\n \n So, to conclude, here is my question:\n Granting that Bush and Kerry now (except for internationalization) have the same official position on what needs to be done in Iraq\n AND\n Recognizing that Bush has failed in his \"efforts\" to implement these proposals over the last 17 months\n AND\n Realizing that Kerry will likely stay in Iraq for longer than Bush to assure that the job get's done\n AND\n Noticing that Bush is subordinating Iraq's future and America's security to Election Politics\n What are the grounds for the pro-Iraq war voter (such as myself) to vote for Bush (at least in regards to his Iraq policy, lets try and keep SBVT OUT of this thread for once)?",

   "Broker, why do you think that Kerry is likely to abandon this plan? Granting for the sake of argument that Kerry is a flipflopper (which I don't really believe, but whatever), this hardly seems to fall into the set of circumstances which would prompt a flipflop.\n \n Kerry doesn't flipflop because he has a fetish for changing his mind. Depending on how generous you are to him, he does it for a mix of two factors:\n 1) Because changing circumstances in the world warrant it\n or\n 2) Because the original position is politically too hot to handle (the corrolary of this is an effort to appeal to all types, liberal pacifists and hawkish moderates)\n \n The first factor hardly seems likely to happen, I don't forsee a type of change in the Iraqi situation that would negate any of his four proposals. The second factor is also unlikely, because it is virtually impossible for Kerry to come under any fire for this. As I said above, since these proposals are virtually indistinguishable from Bush's own, Bush can't attack Kerry on it without highlighting his own failure of vision.\n \n Bush, being a second term president, wouldn't have to worry about declining poll ratings at all, so the prospect of a popular backlash wouldn't mean anything to him. However, I doubt that's really what'd be running through his mind come January 2005. Rather, it would be that Iraq is a continuing embaressment to his administration, and he should seek to take it out of the news cycle as quickly as possible. The fastest way to do that is to bring American troops home so there are no more casualties to parade on the evening news. Kerry, of course, couldn't do that because the GOP would jump all over him. I hate to say it, but in this case rabid republican attack dogs will serve a useful purpose IF AND ONLY IF Kerry is president by forcing him to stay in Iraq until the job is finished, even if that isn't Kerry's inclination.\n \n The same thing goes for Kerry passing Iraq off to the UN. Even if he wanted to (which I doubt), he couldn't, because a) the American right wouldn't let him and b) the UN isn't in any hurry to take responsibility for our mess. What we CAN do (though again, only Kerry has the international legitimacy to do it at this point) is ask for international aid to SUPPLEMENT our own forces, which strikes me as the wisest course of action anyway.\n \n Friendly to Kerry Conclusion: His plan is superior (internationalization), he's showing more grit, and Bush has failed. Advantage: Kerry\n Unfriendly to Kerry Conclusion: His plan is superior (internationalization), but its just election-year posturing. But Bush has just been posturing for 17 months, and unlike Bush, the rightwing attack machine will make it politically impossible for Kerry to not show at least some grit. Advantage: Still Kerry.",

   "Some excellent points have been brought up. I'd like to clarify things in a few respects.\n 1) I war pro-war originally not on WMD/Terrorism grounds but on humaniterean grounds. I do think the US has an obligation to proactively fight against tyranny and oppressors, and yes, I accept and promote the corralary that we should be more aggressive in the Sudan, Congo, and North Korea situations.\n 2) Though Iraq was not a front in the terrorism war originally, it is now. Simply put, for better or for worse our actions have made Iraq a model to the rest of the Arab world for what \"America\" means. And we have a difficult line to toe. If we are callaous or arrogant (as we have been in the past), then we will merely increase anti-american resentment and accusations of bullying, which only feeds al-qaeda and muslim extremists. If we are weak-kneed, then the terrorists will see yet another bead in the string of American's pulling out of projects when tested (eg, Lebanon, Somalia). Beyond that, the moderates we need to reach will see an America that abandoned them (again!) in their hour of most need, further delegitimizing the American model to the very people we need to persuade as to its efficacy in order to see true change in the region. Both of these outcomes would make America far less safe and are entirely unacceptable. The point is this: Even if Iraq could be seperated from the war on terror originally, at this point in time it is crucial to it. Recognizing that that is the REALITY of the situation, I think Kerry's plan is the best at facilitating a positive solution.\n \n Vietnam is qualitatively different for one simple reason: In Vietnam, the US opposed democracy, while in Iraq we support it. Our entire endeavor in Vietnam was essentially an attempt to forestall elections that everyone knew Ho Chi Minh (a national hero) would win easily. Hence, the US couldn't possibly forment a coherent positive rationale for being there, had to resort to murderous thugs as our only allies, and in general was pursuing objectives that were inherently at odds with the desires of the Vietnamese people. In Iraq by contrast, we have solid positive reasons for staying in (building a stable democracy), we've thankfully been opposing the murderous thugs, and our overall objective of a democratized Iraq is supported by the majority of the citizens (including the most powerful leader, Ayatollah Sistani). The problem in Vietnam was a problem of vision, the problem in Iraq is a problem of tactics and implementation.",

Vietnam was 'a bastion of democracy' against the Domino Effect of communism instigated by N. Vietnam (Adlai Stevenson was the originator of the Domino Effect rationalization in 1955). We supported the S. Vietnamese government in 'their fight against communism' and 'advised' their military for 'security' reasons'. The Viet Cong, S. Vietnamese 'insurgents' were our first enemy until N. Vietnam began moving regulars into S. Vietnam. \n \n If you're unaware of the history of that conflict, for years we paid 80% of France's cost of losing their former colony and then took the reins in the name of defending the S. Vietnamese democracy as advisors, for which 50,000 Americans gave their lives. \n \n During this implementation of democracy in Iraq, how do you propose to avoid the inevitable civil war? More troops and money? As to siding with thugs, a majority of the security leadership we're gathering in Iraq are Sunni, the former heads of Saddam's military and national police, and a minority who are hated by both the Kurds, who desire Independence, and the Shia, who are the majority. Many members of our Iraqi puppet government hadn't even lived in Iraq for decades prior to the occupation and must be transported by heavily armed convoys to protect them from the love of their countrymen. As to the majority of Iraqis supporting a Western power who has little respect for their culture or belief system and employs racist profiling of US citizens of ME ancestry, I think our vision there is perhaps more than a little distorted.",

Iraq the Model\n \n I want freedom and democracy and so do most of my friends and relatives, and the vast majority of Iraqis I've known all my life. So do hundreds of thousands of IP, ING members, hundreds of political organizations and millions of Iraqis who are defending the American administration's dream (you know, because we can't have a dream!), and who wait anxiously for the upcoming elections.

They invariable say, \"Get concensus before we go in.\" That's not the lesson I learned. How about you.\n\n \n I remember all of it, especially the 'official' reports versus the reality of people who were there. I'm hearing echos with this one. The problem with this one is that there's no China to tell us no, we're not allowed to stage a large combat army with air and naval support on their border. Mix in politicians with virtually no leash and we arrive at our current state; paranoid, a domestic siege mentality, civil rights dropping away like fall leaves and spending money we don't have that will virtually crush your son with taxation to service our debt. \n \n Like that war, this one won't end regardless of who's elected. Kerry stands a better chance of eventual withdrawal as he's not one of the inner circle championing the Wolfowitz Doctrine, plus he hasn't burned the bridges Bush is known for by other world leaders. If, as is planned, another 3-4 members are added to the UN security council, including Japan, who's largest potential market is China, and the single veto ruling is replaced by a majority ruling, Kerry might stand a chance of swinging UN support our way in resolving Iraq. Bush (actually, to me Cheney) is despised by most important world leaders. He has told all of them, excepting Blair who's tied to our hip, to take a hike and bought the weak ones with aid. Fresh blood would help our cause.\n \n The key issues with terrorism are still Israel and the Sauds. The US public has been so effectively refocused by Iraq that's now almost zilch news. With the current stance from lobbyist pressure regarding those circumstances, neither Bush nor Kerry stands a chance of changing anything there. I'm a numbers guy and believe al Qaeda and descendants could bring us to our economic knees if that remains unresolved. 10-20-years of fighting means nothing in the ME culture. They have tribal feuds hundreds of years old. Again, look at the US in Vietnam and Russia in Afghanistan for lessons on determination. \n \n Kerry may not be much, though I do admire his taste in choosing a wife who is well-traveled, accomplished and familiar with world associations, I find home-town librarians boring when placed in that position, but he does offer a possibility of positive change.

In a Western style democracy civil war is just a matter of when. Elections will eventually put Shia into power. Saddam knew that and used the minority group as his power base for purposes of leadership and oppression as they stood to lose the most in a free country. The Shia will want control of Kurd oil. Give the Kurds semi-autonomy with the result of seriously offending Turkey, still a very significant power in that region who fears their Kurd population will align with Iraqi Kurds in a move for independence. The Shia will go insane. \n \n Other than devastation of their infrastructure, I see no change in Iraq's basic problems with our invasion and occupation. We're just the new boss, spending money we don't have while our administration assumes a humanitarian posture in an attempt to cover up their disastrous error in refocusing the US public from our deeper ME problems.

   "From your unnamed Iraqi - the one who's letting us fight his battle for him:\n \nI want freedom and democracy.....\n\n \n That actually does touch on a lesson of Viet Nam. The Americans were sent in there then - and now - to fight for the American way. tada. Their's was a good cause. To this day the rumor still persists that to pat them on the back as they go and encourage their apple pie mentality is to \"support the troops\".\n \n It's already too late for that. The word is out although it hasn't YET reached everyone. Iraq wasn't behind 9/11. WHEN the early excitement of this war and watching our victorious troops on TV wears off ..... let me look into my crystal ball.\n \n Our soldiers will stream in there unendingly simply because they were ordered to. At this point, it's still a volunteer army who, for the most part, still believes they're in their WTC cause. That won't last forever. America is already bordering on 50% non-believers - if we can get that out of the poll question \"Do you think America is on the right track\". 50% - that's the best case scenario for the attitude of our future troops. Half of them.\n \n The insurgents on the other hand are at 100+%. Their resolve is unwavering. In Viet Nam Charlie was fighting for his country. These people have a double bang. They're out there fighting for both God and country. They will stop at nothing. They fight with the same level of intensity that we would have had the Russians marched down our own street 30 years ago. John Wayne be damned. Moral high ground be damned. Every one of us would have gladly shot those imaginary Russians in the back and worn a white cowboy hat while we did it. We can chit chat about their tactics. Beheadings - see what kind of people they are?. We can chit chat about the correctness of their interpretation of Islam - while they kneel at sunrise. Theirs is not just ideological. Theirs is a gut passion that infidels have occupied their country.\n \n Our resolve will have to survive on memories from multiple years ago, 9/11/2001. But even we don't feel today what we felt on that day. Just as I could never really comprehend when my mother spoke of WWII and Pearl Harbor. For them, they live 9/12 every day. No need for stories of back when. They can point. They can walk out their own front door and see all the proof they need. That's how they recruit new terrorists. That's what they're happy to die for. They're not running a body count. Only we are. No American solder can ever again feel quite the same emotions that he felt three years ago. That's what we're up against. We have a tiger by the tail.\n \n That's what we underestimated in Viet Nam. Superior weaponry and technology isn't the answer then or now. There's no substitute for what they have. And a portion of that is aimed directly at GWB. That makes him expendible. I'm in favor of anything that minimizes their best weapon. That's supporting our troops.",

   "Luckily for all of us, your pessimistic assessment of what happens when non-western nation's attempt western democracy is entirely inaccurate. Democracy IS possible in nation's that \"don't fit the criteria.\"\n Hoover Institute Fellow Larry Diamond notes:\n \n\"[T]he overwhelming bulk of the states that have become democratic during the third wave [of democratization, from 1974-1991] have remained so, even in countries lacking virtually all of the supposed \"conditions\" for democracy. ... [O]nly 14 of the 125 democracies that have existed during the third wave have become authoritarian, and in nine of these, democracy has since been restored.\"\n\n Diamond specifically cites Mali--a poor, landlocked, predominantly Muslim country that suffers from an adult literacy rate of less than 50 percent and an average life expectancy of less than 45 years. In spite of these handicaps, the country has enjoyed a relatively stable, democratic government for over a decade.\n This doesn't change for countries where democracy is imposed via military occupation. Daniel Drezner, Asst. Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago points out:\n \n \"But what of governments imposed via military occupation? Surely they're the exception to this optimistic rule. Actually, the empirical evidence of the last 50 years is rather evenly split on the question. Postwar Germany, Japan, Bosnia, and Kosovo are all, to varying degrees, democratic success stories; Somalia and Haiti are probably safely considered failures. (Let's be generous and say the jury is still out on Afghanistan.) Still, the more relevant point is that the key difference between the democratic haves and have-nots is not the conditions that prevailed prior to war; it's the occupiers' commitment to the democratization process once the fighting ends. In the words of a compelling new RAND Corporation study, America's Role in Nation-Building: From Germany to Iraq: \n \n 'What principally distinguishes [successes from failures] are not their levels of Western culture, economic development, or cultural homogeneity. Rather, it is the level of effort the United States and the international community have put into their democratic transformations. In Germany and Japan, for example, substantial American aid reduced social, political, and other obstacles to the reconstitution of parliamentary politics and facilitated a transition to democracy. Nation-building, as this study illustrates, is a time- and resource-consuming effort'\"\n\n \n Civil war is NOT inevitable, but it will be if we don't dedicate the proper resources to managing the conflicts.\n \n I think your assessment that every insurgent is permanently 100% against the US also is incorrect. Recall the original flash point for the insurgency: It wasn't that the US was trying to \"impose\" western democracy, or give too many rights to kurds, or not implement sharia law. It was because the US wasn't percieved as moving towards democracy FAST enough, and the Iraqi's thought they were going to put in a puppet government and leave. Now, of course, we have bona fide insurgents who hate the US and have been radicalized to the extent that they will oppose the US and any government that stems from our occupation (including democratic ones). These people need to dealt with, and quickly, because they pose a serious threat towards getting Iraq on the right track. But the reason there still is hope is because the most powerful man in Iraq (Ayatollah Sistani) still, at root, wants democracy as well, and as we've seen in Najaf, he can exert considerable influence even over Sadr's firebrand extremists. I think that if the US shows itself serious about kickstarting democracy, and that its NOT serious about colonization by bringing in the UN and other outsiders, we can win a large portion of the Iraqi population back.",

Questions of nation building for self-interest are pushed below the surface in those same dialogs. \n \n Until the US fields a force similar in size and brutality to what Saddam employed to govern Iraq, be it solely US or a combination of US/Iraqi military, there will be no lasting central control in Iraq. To accomplish and maintain that state of affairs will require suspension of all civil rights under a secular policy of force with little trace of democracy. Attempted annihilation of the current crop of Iraqi Nationalists resisting US occupation will simply multiply their numbers and reinforce their fundamentalist goals to end US occupation of their country. \n \n Having watched our early official policy go from a UN sanctioned population census is absolutely required for elections to this week's elections by 1/05 at any cost, and our commander-in-chief currently stating no additional troops are required in Iraq with vast areas currently being controlled by Iraqi nationalists, I smell more really sleazy election year rhetoric as the public is again conned and the pockets of our grandchildren emptied in the name of, what is it this week?

For those who are anti-war, it was always obvious that Bush was against their interests. This thread sought to show that even for the pro-war folks, he's the wrong choice too. And while perhaps I'm a bit more optimistic than you are, I think we can all agree we still need to do all we can.\n \n Broker, the point is even if Kerry can't get a SINGLE other nation to send in more troops (and I think there at least a few candidates, such as Germany and Canada), that's not all internationalization means. It means aid and advice for reconstruction, it means contracters, and most importantly, it means reassuring the Iraqis that this isnt a US imperial mission in disguise. Even if Kerry can't get any more troops, he's still qualitatively better than Bush because he can at least get alternative forms of international support, while Bush can't get any.\n As to Kerry's \"shifting\" Iraq stance, maybe he has and maybe he hasn't, but it actually isn't relevant at all. Now, personally I think he'll stick with the plan I outlined above (the NYU speech plan) because a) its getting an excellent reception in the press/media and voters and b) its actually a really good plan. Again, look to the Novak article: Its BUSH who is contemplating the quick and dirty withdrawal. But even if Kerry wanted to leave the day after he's inaugerated, he wouldn't be able to because as I said above, he'd immediately by beset upon by GOP attack dogs (rightly in this case). Politicians generally dont knowingly commit suicide in the first 2 weeks of their term. As I said above\n \nFriendly to Kerry Conclusion: His plan is superior (internationalization), he's showing more grit, and Bush has failed. Advantage: Kerry\n Unfriendly to Kerry Conclusion: His plan is superior (internationalization), but its just election-year posturing. But Bush has just been posturing for 17 months, and unlike Bush, the rightwing attack machine will make it politically impossible for Kerry to not show at least some grit. Advantage: Still Kerry. \n\n Regarldess of whether he does the right thing because he wants to or because he has to, he's still more likely to do it and do it successfully than Bush is.\n \n Georged, for an example of an ethnically and religiously fractured country that currently is enjoying a relatively stable democracy, please see Nigeria. Scholarly models aren't just the Ivory Tower version of masterbation. They do make efforts to reflect on reality. The RAND model seems close to the reality I've observed, though I'd of course be open to sources which show otherwise (again, Vietnam is not a good example because the US was fighting against democracy and for dictatorship, so it doesn't matter how many dollars we put in).",

And the ongoing, corrupt military rule since England got tired of them. And the recent (ten years) of a majority of the brainpower and intellectuals emigrating for better opportunities. I hope nothing so brutal as Biafra, but I'm afraid Iraq, with their widely separated religious and ethnic differences formerly controlled by brute force, is in for a rough patch. \n \n If I was Kerry and elected president, the first thing I'd do is reposition all US troops to protect the oil industry. Then immediately turn the reconstruction, with us paying the bills on a cost plus basis, over to a UN recommended firm, within 60-days. Let the present Iraqi military and civil forces recruit and employ without an American presence and under martial law. Put a cleric in charge and let him pursue elections. After showing intent, I'd then go to the UN with hat in hand and request troops to guard the only Iraqi assets with the US footing the bill. Let the Iraqis deal with elections, security or whatever happens to work out. Then we could see where it was at and make any adjustments necessary to hasten our departure.",

Like Bush senior placing two sons in different states to shed the political stigma of Old Eastern Money (which he actually is), GWB's professional role in life has been planned since early childhood with little requirement for personal responsibility. The father had the 'good' war record, the rest of the solid gold political credentials and connections, and GWB was in a waiting period. Some business bones were thrown his way for closer attachment to special interests, he sowed some wild oates, became born-again to publicly absolve past moral issues, took the largely ceremonial Texas Governorship as a president in waiting. We're talking about a tool of special interests, certainly not an intellectual with strong concern for his actions. Throw in Cheney for the tough decisions and liason to the movers and shakers and I think what you see, all of it, is what you get. His sole purpose in life is to not suffer the same fate as senior, a one-term president, at any cost. One term was enough for me.",
