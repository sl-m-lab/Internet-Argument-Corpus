So we have the tenancy to think that rich people are inherently oppressive and evil, because this is the picture we are fed. Its not an accident that this is what we are taught about the rich, nor the emotional associations with money that it creates. The systems of organized religion, public education and mass media are all designed to perpetuate the image in the minds of the citizens that being rich is linked to negativity at some essential level. And that's exactly what happens. If we were to learn that most rich people are actually honest, ethical and charitable it would create a conflict with what we believe and want to believe. We would rather think that the rich philanthropist is the exception rather than the rule. We would like to assume that the rich is bad at some fundamental level because it helps us feel good about ourselves being not rich, which is exactly what the rich want.\n \n I don't see it as a system to dispose, I see it as something to learn from and adapt to.",
