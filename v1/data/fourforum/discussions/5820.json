   "I discovered some time ago the notion of a strict liability crime. Some notable examples include statutory rape and underage liquor sales. Suppose you (are a man and you) meet a young, attractive woman. Because you are mindful of the dangers of committing statutory rape, before you have sex with her, you check her ID while she is out of the room. It says she is over the age of consent, but in fact she isn't. So you have sex with her, and are later accused of statutory rape. You cannot point to the fact that you checked her ID, because for you to be found guilty, the prosecution only has to show that the crime occured, not that you were knowingly guilty. This is what strict liability means.\n \n The same goes for alcohol sales. It doesn't matter how good the fake is, you're still guilty if you sell to a minor.\n \n So the question is, is strict liability an acceptable principle in criminal law? I claim that the preceding examples constitute a reductio of strict liability. Thoughts?",

Sorry I wasn't clearer.\n\n \n He may be talking abotu somewhere else, but the post certainly fits with the strict liability laws of the US.\n \n Provign intent has largely been removed from the US legal system. They found it too difficult to prosecute many different types of cases from income tax fraud to driving while suspended. We haev over 300 million laws in the US. If you had to prove intent in order to prosecute people, you would first have to expect that people actually know the law they are violating, or at least that they knew what they were doing was wrong.",

   "\n The first part requests that you specify whose laws we're talking about. \n \n\n \n USA\n \n \n\n The second part requests that you explain how 'intent' fits into the concept of strict liability.\n \n\n \n The whole point is that it doesn't. Strict liability means that intent is irrelevant. I don't really understand what you're asking me.\n \n Now, I'm not very well versed with the logic of laws, but the whole issue of statutory rape seems like it is analogous to negligence. When you have sex with a person below the age of consent, it could be argued in certain cases that your crime was not so much what you did (have sex with an underage person), but what you didn't do (failed to ensure that the person was of age) when the situation is such that it is reasonable to believe that the person is of age.\n \n Suppose I am skipping rocks on a pond and I accidentaly strike and kill a snorkler. If charged with manslaughter, I could argue that I have never heard of anyone snorkeling in this pond, it's not the sort of pond I would *expect* anyone to snorkel in, and I looked into the pond as I passed by before skipping rocks and did not see anyone. Having made a reasonable effort to establish that I would not commit a crime, I suspect I would get off. Is this not the case?\n \n So my questions are:\n \n 1. Given that there are situations is which it is clear that one could commit statutory rape and have proof beyond reasonable doubt that one is not committing statutory rape, what justifies ignoring this fact by making it a strict liability crime?\n \n 2. What justifies the notion of strict liability in criminal cases at all, given that one could in almost any crime have proof beyond reasonable doubt that one was not committing a crime? What are examples of crimes which require strict liability?\n \n I understand that unjustified pragmatic methodologies are sometimes used and that it may be what has happened in the situations mentioned. I want to know what if any justification is given, or whether reasonable justification *could* be given. daewoo brings up tax law, but I explicitly restricted the scope of the discussion to criminal law, as I understand there are arguments (although I do not know them) for strict liability in civil matters. We could, however, digress to the issue of whether strict liability is justified in *any* case. Why is proof beyond reasonable doubt that one would not commit a wrong not acceptable for an arbitrary issue, practical problems aside? However, we should stick to the main point if possible.\n \n Lest I be accused of intellectual dishonesty, I should admit that I find the entire notion of statutory rape to be ridiculous, unjustified paternalism. However, if anyone wants to discuss that, we should branch the debate (or perhaps take it to email or PMs, as in my experience the argument tends to attract a great deal of four-letter words, and a very low level of reasoning).",

   "I can understand what is being said in England we do not have statutory rape more u.s.i underage sexual intercourse.What gets me is the legal age of consent is 16 in England,but if you meet a girl in a nightclub[legal age for being in a night club is 18]and she turns out to be under 16 you will still get done for it.Now i believe you could be reasonably expecting her to be 18 as that is the legal age for her to be in there,so my question is this: Should the club be charged as an accessory and should you be charged for a crime you could not possibly know you were commiting.Should the girl go to court as was on the night she was in the nightclub.There is also a law that states if you have sex with a woman who is drunk then you are liable for a charge of rape.",

   "So the question is, is strict liability an acceptable principle in criminal law?\n\n Yup, because otherwise we wouldn't be able to prosecute a lot of crims (or misdemeanors, etc.)\n \n There are two types of offenses: malum in se and malum prohibitum, roughly \"bad because it's bad\" and \"bad because we say so.\"\n \n Typically, all statutory laws not based on common law fall into the latter category, and these laws are almost entirely strict liability.\n \n For example: There's a law that says you cannot possess heroine. Possession of heroine in itself is not bad, it doesn't harm society in any way (although what you do with it may harm society), and so we say that possession of heroine is a strict liability crime. There is no requirement of an intent to possess, because that would be nearly impossible to prove; the only evidence of an intent to possess is the possession itself.\n \n That being said, I do believe that deception should be an acceptable defense to statutory rape. If a young man or woman attemps to pass themselves off as someone over the legal age of consent (fake id or other), then the offender shouldn't be convicted of statutory rape. But doing away with strict liability is not the way to go.",

What I'm suggesting is that if the defense can provide strong evidence for intent to not possess, then they should not be found guilty. I don't know *how* strong, as I know there are different levels of legal evidence.\n\n There are several different burdens of proof for crimes:\n \n Specific Intent: Prosecution must show that the person intended the result. First degree murder is a specific intent crime. You intentionally shot at a guy with an intent to kill.\n \n Prosecution has to show that you intended the act and the result.\n \n General Intent: Prosecution has to show that the preson intended the action, but not the result. Vehicular manslaughter is a general intent crime. You intended to drive your car 100 MPH while intoxicated, but you didn't intend to hit another car and kill its occupant.\n \n Prosecution only has to show that the act was intentional.\n \n Strict Liability: Evidence of the crime (and that you were the actor) is sufficient. You possessed heroin (or statutory rape, exceeded the speed limit, parked near a fire hydrant, etc.), you are guilty.\n \n There are generally some defenses to these crimes: duress (carjacked, forced at gunpoint to speed down the highway), necessity (passenger is bleeding heavily, you need to get to a hospital), public authority (cops, ambulances), and a few others.\n \n Lack of knowledge that a stash of heroin is present in your car may be a defense to possession, but there has to be no question of the fact that you didn't know about it. That is, more than your word.\n \n Anyway, I think what was being (or should have been) advocated in the first post wasn't a removal of the strict liability burden of proof, rather a defense to the crime of statutory rape. If a woman intends to deceive and actually deceives a man into believing she is of legal age and they have sex, then the man should not be punished for the woman's actions.\n \n Of course, NOW would say I'm a sexist bigot for suggesting such a thing.",
