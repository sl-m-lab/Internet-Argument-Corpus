   "Tunguska blast was due to a comet impact\n \n Tunguska blast was most probably due to a comet impact. \n Here, the following points may be important:\n \u0095 The comet is a fireball, not as do they say a mass of dirt and snow.\n \u0095 It has an affinity to fall on the frozen and ice regions like Siberia, the north and south polar regions.\n \u0095 The comet, contrary to the meteorite, will dig through the ground to disappear inside the earth, while the meteorite will stay upon the surface of the earth.\n \u0095 It will cause much heat, burns and destruction because it is flaming, more than the friction of the meteorite with the air that will cause the meteorite to be hot, but not to the extent of the flaming comet. \n Refer to our site: \n http://universeandquran.741.com \n And see there the subject of: \n http://universeandquran.741.com/new_page_3.htm#Comets\n Where the following is mentioned:\n \" The Day when the Comet struck the Earth Surface\n \"... In the morning of June 30, 1908, at 7 am, while the farmer Semenov was sitting in the balcony of his house, in the northern parts of middle Siberia; he suddenly saw in the north a flaming object with somewhat bluish coloration, larger than the sun disc, traversing the space, to fall in the planes of Siberia, between two rivers there, where a pillar of light came down.\n In spite of that this light was about fifty miles away from his house, the heat was so extensive to let the farmer Semenov feel his clothes about to burn.... In the site of that strange light, a shepherd called Lukhtikan was driving to the pasture a herd of 1500 deers, and Lukhtikan's herd was stricken just before Semenov was stricken too by the same hot air; so that all the herd perished and nothing of it was found except few burnt bodies.... \n Four hundred miles away, the men working in the Siberia Railways saw suddenly a glowing in the northern-east, then the train started to shake vigorously; therefore, they stopped it to avoid its deviation from the line....\n Years passed by, and the event was nearly forgotten; but at 1927, Professor L. Kulik [a famous Russian Astronomer), leading an expedition, went to that remote district where the light pillar had risen in the air, where he found a depression, not very deep, extending over an area of two miles. ...\n [It may be this depression is now the same lake (:Lake Cheko :\n http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=N+60+57'+49%22+E+101+51'+36%22&ie=UTF8&ll=60.962527,101.860943&spn=0.038494,0.119991&t=k&z=13&om=1 ) that an Italian expedition led by marine geologist Luca Gasperini have explored.]\n Mankind were very lucky on that day of the year 1908; for if the comet had fallen on New York or Paris instead of falling on an uninhabited area, then that could have been one of the great disasters in the history.\n Undoubtedly, that event was caused by a comet; for on the 30th. of June 1908, the Earth globe was near to the orbit of another comet. It seems that the big comet that had fallen on Siberia was part of it.\"\n \n And see, in this contest, the following subject in the SkyandTelescope.com: \n \n \"Next summer marks the centennial anniversary of one of Earth's most famous \"close encounters\" with an extraterrestrial object. On June 30, 1908, something big exploded in the sky over a remote section of Siberia near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River. The blast leveled about 800 square miles of forested taiga.\"\n http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/home/12662606.html\n \n See also\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event\n http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/home/8134097.html\n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/403991.stm\n \n \n eanassir\n http://universeandquran.741.com",

Pretty interesting that if comets were made of \"fire\" (from the sun, etc.) that we could do this DEEP IMPACT mission and impact the comet, and then study the ejecta to find out this: \n \nAnalysis of data from the Swift X-ray telescope showed that the comet continued outgassing from the impact for 13 days, with a peak five days after impact. A total of 250,000 tonnes of water[36] and between 10 and 25 million kilograms of dust were lost from the impact.[34]\n \n Initial results were surprising as the material excavated by the impact contained more dust and less ice than had been expected. The only models of cometary structure astronomers could positively rule out were the very porous models which had comets as loose aggregates of material. In addition, the material was finer than expected; scientists likened it to talcum powder rather than sand.[37] Other materials found while studying the impact included clays, carbonates, sodium, and crystalline silicates which were found by studying the spectroscopy of the impact.[11] Clays and carbonates usually require liquid water to form and sodium is rare in space.[38] Observations also revealed that the comet was about 75% empty space, and one astronomer compared the outer layers of the comet to the same makeup of a snow bank.[11] \n \n\n \n Funny, huh? emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes",

But he forgave his personal enemies who hurt him, and killed his uncle.\n \n The circumstances of Jesus Christ were different; he came to reform a complex thing: a people who were assigned by God to bear the religion of God, yet they took the outside of the religion and hold fast with their traditions rather than the commandments of God.\n \n eanassir\n http://quranandhebrewbible.t35.com",

   "Tunguska blast was due to a comet impact\n \n Tunguska blast was most probably due to a comet impact. \n Here, the following points may be important:\n \u0095 The comet is a fireball, not as do they say a mass of dirt and snow.\n \u0095 It has an affinity to fall on the frozen and ice regions like Siberia, the north and south polar regions.\n \u0095 The comet, contrary to the meteorite, will dig through the ground to disappear inside the earth, while the meteorite will stay upon the surface of the earth.\n \u0095 It will cause much heat, burns and destruction because it is flaming, more than the friction of the meteorite with the air that will cause the meteorite to be hot, but not to the extent of the flaming comet. \n Refer to our site: \n http://universeandquran.741.com \n And see there the subject of: \n http://universeandquran.741.com/new_page_3.htm#Comets\n Where the following is mentioned:\n \" The Day when the Comet struck the Earth Surface\n \"... In the morning of June 30, 1908, at 7 am, while the farmer Semenov was sitting in the balcony of his house, in the northern parts of middle Siberia; he suddenly saw in the north a flaming object with somewhat bluish coloration, larger than the sun disc, traversing the space, to fall in the planes of Siberia, between two rivers there, where a pillar of light came down.\n In spite of that this light was about fifty miles away from his house, the heat was so extensive to let the farmer Semenov feel his clothes about to burn.... In the site of that strange light, a shepherd called Lukhtikan was driving to the pasture a herd of 1500 deers, and Lukhtikan's herd was stricken just before Semenov was stricken too by the same hot air; so that all the herd perished and nothing of it was found except few burnt bodies.... \n Four hundred miles away, the men working in the Siberia Railways saw suddenly a glowing in the northern-east, then the train started to shake vigorously; therefore, they stopped it to avoid its deviation from the line....\n Years passed by, and the event was nearly forgotten; but at 1927, Professor L. Kulik [a famous Russian Astronomer), leading an expedition, went to that remote district where the light pillar had risen in the air, where he found a depression, not very deep, extending over an area of two miles. ...\n [It may be this depression is now the same lake (:Lake Cheko :\n http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=N+60+57'+49%22+E+101+51'+36%22&ie=UTF8&ll=60.962527,101.860943&spn=0.038494,0.119991&t=k&z=13&om=1 ) that an Italian expedition led by marine geologist Luca Gasperini have explored.]\n Mankind were very lucky on that day of the year 1908; for if the comet had fallen on New York or Paris instead of falling on an uninhabited area, then that could have been one of the great disasters in the history.\n Undoubtedly, that event was caused by a comet; for on the 30th. of June 1908, the Earth globe was near to the orbit of another comet. It seems that the big comet that had fallen on Siberia was part of it.\"\n \n And see, in this contest, the following subject in the SkyandTelescope.com: \n \n \"Next summer marks the centennial anniversary of one of Earth's most famous \"close encounters\" with an extraterrestrial object. On June 30, 1908, something big exploded in the sky over a remote section of Siberia near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River. The blast leveled about 800 square miles of forested taiga.\"\n http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/home/12662606.html\n \n See also\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event\n http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/home/8134097.html\n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/403991.stm\n \n \n eanassir\n http://universeandquran.741.com\n\n \n Interestingly enough, CNN just had a recent article about the ASTEROID that caused the Tunguska blast.

In addition to that, Palestinians and the Arab love Jesus Christ and respect his mother Mary even more than Christians themselves do.\n \n I am not against the scientific progress, but try to let others see what miracles are in the Glorious Quran as God - be glorified - said in the Quran 41: 53\n &#1587;&#1614;&#1606;&#1615;&#1585;&#1616;&#1610;&#1607;&#1616;&#1605;&#1618; &#1570;&#1610;&#1614;&#1575;&#1578;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1601;&#1616;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1570;&#1601;&#1614;&#1575;&#1602;&#1616; &#1608;&#1614;&#1601;&#1616;&#1610; &#1571;&#1614;&#1606;&#1601;&#1615;&#1587;&#1616;&#1607;&#1616;&#1605;&#1618; &#1581;&#1614;&#1578;&#1617;&#1614;&#1609; &#1610;&#1614;&#1578;&#1614;&#1576;&#1614;&#1610;&#1617;&#1614;&#1606;&#1614; &#1604;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1571;&#1614;&#1606;&#1617;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1581;&#1614;&#1602;&#1617;&#1615; &#1571;&#1614;&#1608;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1605;&#1618; &#1610;&#1614;&#1603;&#1618;&#1601;&#1616; &#1576;&#1616;&#1585;&#1614;&#1576;&#1617;&#1616;&#1603;&#1614; &#1571;&#1614;&#1606;&#1617;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615; &#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1609; &#1603;&#1615;&#1604;&#1617;&#1616; &#1588;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1569;&#1613; &#1588;&#1614;&#1607;&#1616;&#1610;&#1583;&#1612;\n The explanation: (We will show them Our portents on the horizons [of the sky] and among themselves until it will become manifest to them that [the Quran] is the truth.
