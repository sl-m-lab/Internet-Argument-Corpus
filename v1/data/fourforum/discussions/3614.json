No candidate for president in 30 years has received more than 50% of the popular vote, until now with Bush carrying 51%. Looking back at the close calls in 2000 (New Mexico going to Gore by about 350 and Florida going to Bush by 550), Bush overwhelmingly won them this time. He lost New Mexico by 350 some odd votes in 2000; with 99% of the precincts reported in New Mexico, Bush had a 15,000 vote lead, much higher than his 350 vote loss in 2000. With 100% of Florida precincts reported, Bush is up 370,000, much higher than his 550 vote win in 2000. Bush lost the popular vote by 500,000 votes and .5% in 2000; he is not up 3.5 million votes and 3%.\n \n I honestly think there is no possible way for Kerry to win. With Bush up 135,000 votes in Ohio with only provisional and absentee ballots to cast (approximately 250,000), it is impossible for him to make that up. The Secretary of State in Ohio also said that the provisional and absentee ballots were scattered evenly among Republican and Democratic strongholds, therefore ensuring a virtual split. Kerry would need to win over 80% of all remaining absentee and provisional ballots in Ohio.\n \n I think the voting process, so far, went quite well. The only flaw is that some states have yet to be called, and we have yet to have a \"clear\" winner. But at least they have waited to call some states rather than venture out on a limb like they did in 2000 in Florida.\n \n We need a national voting system in this country. Since we will have 4 years to work on it, here's where we should begin. Everyone should, in the next 4 years, go to DMV with proof of citizenship and ID. DMV will issue a Voter Credit Card, which will be used only for voting purposes. Each state will have the same electronic machines. When voters go to the polls, all they need to do is swipe their card. This will drastically cut down on the long lines due to concerns of voter fraud and/or eligibility. This will also get rid of the need for absentee ballots (excluding overseas ballots) because when a voter swipes his/her card, the machine will upload information for his Congressional district. This means a VA resident can vote in Texas with no problems. It will also get the vote tallys in quicker. It will probably be expensive, but it will be well worth it.",

   "It is a mandate to govern under the rules of the game, so yes.\n \n Is it a good thing? well for the President you have a win/loose situation and no ground in between so it does not weaken their power to govern effectively.\n \n That can only be done by the composition of the upper and lower house..... if this is split then things get more interesting. On the one hand legislation has to meet a broader base of opinion and thus more extreme stuff tends to get stopped or revised and toned down. On the other it means there can be endless bickering over fairly trivial issues and it panders to \"rebel\" groups in the party with the slight majority (like John Major's \"B*astards\").\n \n This is the situation that existed in Britain after the 1992 General Election..... the Conservatives were ruined as a party of government by that episode.",
