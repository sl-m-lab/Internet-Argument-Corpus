They do this by using parts that are essentially the lowest common denominator. IF they can save $1 by going with a crappy, no name sound card, they will do it. Their computers almost never have the newest and best mainboards, video, etc.... becasue newest generally involves some trouble, whihc means $$$ spent on tech support for their customers.",

   "That is something but here is one better. A customer came into my shop with a Dell laptop and Dell told him that his mother board was fried.\n \n But the computer runs fine until it gets to a certain temperature then it shuts off. I found that a fan was not working and problem solved. But Dell wanted to charge the customer $600 to replace the motherboard.\n \n I say stay way from Dell's",
