   "Alright what would you suggest to a child who has a divorced mother and father and is still in close contact with one parent but lives with the other?.....The parents have conflicting views on curfew, grades, and other things who is the one you should honor...by honoring one you are dishonoring another?.....Just something I thought about since I saw a thing about divorce rates and kids behaving badly now a days on TV....",

   "why is it necessary to dishonor either? why is it not possible to honor both? if the parents each have differring views about the relationship and family, its between them, but it doesnt necessarily mean you must pick a side. and even if you do favor one's view and disagree with the other's, that doesnt mean you dishonor them. you can respect someone even if you dont agree with them. you can love someone even though you may never see things their way. honor and acquiescence are not synonymous or necessarily linked",

   "I think the problem must be addressed to the parents. Parents remain parents; although they're divorced it's important that the two agree on parenting plans. They must agree on how they will discipline their children. Parents must see that the kids are away from drugs and bad peers. As for the children, they must honor both their mom and dad. It's important that they listen well and understand their parents. \n \n \n I filed for uncontested divorce last year. At first, my ex and I had been bickering on how we raise the kids. I'm strict about school and house chores but my ex spoils my children much. There was a time when my youngest son wanted to stay with his dad. i talked to my ex and then we agreed on keeping a strict yet acceptable rules for the children.",
