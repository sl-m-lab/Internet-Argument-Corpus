Yes or no? If the answer is yes and it is then they are sexist\n This is like asking \"Do you support helping children and raping small boys?\"...you would say no and then people would say you don't support helping children. So therefore I am going to breakdown this question. Yes we oppose a womens right to abortion. No we don't oppose equal pay. Equal rights amendment...that thing is garbage.

The party of tolerance is not so tolerant.\n \n \nConservatives oppose gay rights on every level from equal marriage to non discrimination. Yes or no?

As long as he's not hurting anyone by being married to another man, what's the problem? Why does the government have a legal structure in place to regulate one form of marriage but doesn't regulate another?\n \n Sure but what if the majority thinks it is wrong, like stealing? Not saying the majority is always riight, but we have to have some common ground to work with. The kids should have a choice to go to church. But then again they have to obey their parents or is that an example of stifling a childs rights? \n \n sorry I was responding to mattew's comments in order.

   "Why does this belong in the philosophy section?\nPolitical philosophies shape and separate parties. The thread is not misplaced. It has, as often occurs here, degenerated into a discussion of 'injustices' against gays and lesbians. This generally occurs when narrow-minded, tunnel vision people enter the discussion on their soapboxes.\n \n To begin with, Bassman generalized greatly in the OP. There is no one-sentence descriptor of either the conservative or liberal groups that clearly describes without exception, every member of either group. There is the ever-present bell-shaped curve to consider in every comparison involving large numbers of people. There are conservatives for and against abortion; there are liberals for and against gay marriage. Generalizations serve only to confuse the discussions by miffing those who take exception to being lumped into one group or another simply because of their stance on a single issue. I can understand why very few people welcome being called a 'liberal'. Likewise, 'conservative' may have its offensive facets when the widely accepted definition does not adequately describe the targeted person.\n \n When you say that conservatives believe this and liberals believe that, all you are doing is misinterpreting the true philosophies of many individuals in each group.\n \n I consider myself conservative but I am very much not against abortion under several sets of circumstances. I believe in the death penalty for several crimes. I have compassion for those who can't seem to support themselves, but none for the welfare whores who have children to increase their income. I do not browbeat people to believe as I do, but simply to live, let live and to try not to favor the weakening of our on resolve to live as a free people and to support freedom elsewhere in the world.\n \n I have complete disdain for those who vote against capable and highly qualified nominees simply because the other side made the nomination.\n \n Both sides tend to investigate and criticize the other too much. Well-known leaders from the left seem to ignore failures from within their group as they continually rail on the right for transgressions of similar natures.
