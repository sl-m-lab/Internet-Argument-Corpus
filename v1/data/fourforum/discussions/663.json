   "The other post was getting far too long and I wanted to draw this to your attention to ensure a response.\n \n <<<I appreciate the humor of your post and hope that our laughter doesn't completely destroy us.<<<\n \n No, there was nothing humerous about what I wrote. It was in poor taste. I apologize.\n \n I would like to see you post the comments of actual scientists regarding evolution, per your earlier offer to do so. This is not a challenge by any means. I ask this because I am absolutely certain of three things regarding any quote you might post:\n \n (1) It will be a legitimate quote by a legitimate scientist who has outlined certain problems with evolution, perhaps not even to challenge it but to pose a question which needs to be answered and, if given enough time and evidence, very well could be.\n \n (2) It will be a legitimate quote by a legitimate scientist, but taken completely out of context. I have tremendous faith in Lurch et al to be able to place said quote into its proper context (in relatively easy to understand terms, please).\n \n (3) It will be a quote by someone who claims to have more scientific knowledge than they do, or someone with a background in a science which may only be marginally (or not at all) associated with the scientific disciplines required to comment intelligently on evolution.\n \n Again, this is not a challenge. I am so utterly certain of what I say that I want you to post these messages for your own sake and for the sake of both our educations. There are fabulous teachers on this forum if you take the time to read them. \n \n But Lappster, you must understand that your posting any direct quotes from actual scientists in support of creationism (or in opposition of evolution) will require great courage on your part. Many of the writers on this forum who are in favor of evolution come from scientific backgrounds, and they will pull no punches in discrediting anything that you post. You see, despite the fact that the majority of Americans believe in creationism, it is not by any means accepted scientific theory. Evolution on the other hand is. So because we are talking about subjects in the realm of scientific debate, you must therefore conduct your fight within the parameters of science: offer the evidence you propose to have collected, not in your words but in the words of the actual scientists. Provide links to your findings so that we can look for ourselves. Do not spend an excess amount of time telling us what the quotes mean or how you interpret them. This will open YOU up to debate, and we don't want to debate you --- we want to debate your sources. If their words are meaningful enough, they will speak for themselves. Please do not respond to this message by saying something like \"There is a plethora of evidence to support what I say all over the place --- go and find it.\" That would be a copout. If you honestly have as many sources as you say, then spend an evening or two collecting them, compiling them and posting them for everyone to read. It's only a simple courtesy which posters (at least to the old forum) in favor of evolution have extended time and time again. If you have the facts, then spend a little time and take a little effort to show us.\n \n The courage part comes into play when you realize that your very belief system (by belief system I do not mean Christianity, but anti-evolution) is in jeaopardy. It's one thing for people to argue and debate YOUR words. It's an entirely different thing when you offer up to the wolves the very sources that are substantiating your disbelief in evolution (or belief in creationism).\n \n I sincerely hope that you will respond positively to this message and provide as many quotes (with links or sources) as you can.\n \n As for the lack of politeness and dignified responses you have encountered, it's simply because you are outnumbered here. If I found a Christian message forum and began posting messages about the truth of evolution, I would hardly be welcomed or treated with the kind of respect you wanted here. But yes, this IS a debate forum, though perhaps one where the anonymity of the internet allows people to take the gloves off a bit more easily and with clear conscience (I don't have to see you at the watercooler tomorrow morning and therefore don't mind slinging a little mud in your face). But Lappster, find some friends who believe what you do and invite them to this forum to debate. Increase the numbers of your compatriots and let us get a real debate going. Start with your scientific sources and please, please, read the responses you get always with the mindset of giving God what belongs to God, giving science what belongs to science.\n \n MQ",

   "I apreciate the challenge. Moreover I appreciate its endevor. I will collect what I have available. As you have stated there are many more resources than I could possibly gather. Is there one specific area your challenge would like to begin it's focus? \n I will as you said examine the arguements as they present them self. But as I have stated before I belive this issue to be a matter of faith, this will be harder to turn than any source I have. \n \n When I agreed with evolution it was in ignorance. It was the only thing I knew and was taught in public school. When I was converted I developed the faith which drives me. I use sources only to back up that which I accept by faith.\n \n I believe it will take several days to assemble the information available. My time cannot be entirely devoted to this issue.",

   "I apreciate the challenge.\n\n \n I admit that when I reread my words it did sound very much like a challenge. I had specifically said it was not. But it was posed in such a way that any other interpretaion would be foolish. I suppose it was a challenge, but not just to you. I do want you to bring your sources and your friends to this little roundtable so we can debate. Rest assured that I am every bit as interested in how those in favor of evolution conduct themselves as I am in the arguments you bring to the table. I thoroughly know that evolution is the answer to the question of the diversity of species and the origins of man and you could no more convince me otherwise than you could convince me that the sky is composed of purple and green polkadots. Where I cannot directly debate the items you may bring to the table, I am excitedly anticipating the refutes of Lurch and others. To me, it's good show. I believe thoroughly that you will never be convinced of the truth of evolution until you are ready and want to be. That day may never come, but I also believe that if you do chose to change your mind one day, these debates may be said to have planted important seeds in your mind. You know, my girlfriend believes in evolution but is wavering. She is fairly more religious than I am and has \n some feelings of guilt over the secular nature of the science. I have explained to her that all science is secular and that if it were any other way it would be a tragic disservice to science (and progress). One thing I have been meaning to mention on this forum is that science is all around us. The brilliant architecture of a cathedral, the electricity responsible for illuminating it, the methods of mass production and printing that allow for a copy of the gospel in every pew is made possible by advancements in science. Much like God, it is everywhere all at once and yet never seen, or never noticed by those without the eyes to see it. I know that your fight is not against science, per se, but this onc major branch of science. But what you must understand is that to fight evolution is to fight science itself. When you disregard the enormity of evidence in favor of evolution, you disregard scientific method altogether. Without scientific method there is no science --- or at the very least monumentally stunted scientific progress. I know, I know, I know, Lappster, you don't even need to say it. I'll say it for you. The fight against evolution is not the fight against the methods they use to test their theories and evidence, but a fight against their interpretation of the outcomes. But don't you see the pure folly of judging their interpretations from your isolated view on the outside? To you it's a simple matter of looking at two fossils, one of a fish and one of an amphibian. They say \"Here, fish walked out of the water,\" you say \"No, God put them there individually and spontaneously.\" I know that I simplify both arguments to the point of absurdity, but follow me. You see Lappster, science is making headway in areas so far beyond our grasp (and very possibly everyone's on this forum) that while you and I are still bickering over whether the Earth is round, they're busy colonizing Alpha Centauri. You and I are kicking our mules to get them to move those carts full of potatoes to Old Man Larson's General Store before he closes for the evening, and meanwhile science is trying to develop photon torpedos that can track a Romulan ship under cloak in order to counter the threat of recent incursions into the friggin Neutral Zone. And you're going to challenge the entire scientific establishment (or an overwhelming majority of it) with a Bible in one hand and a mouse in the other? This simply cannot be done, Lappster.\n \n On the other hand, maybe I don't give you enough credit. So do your worst, as they say.\n \n \nIs there one specific area your challenge would like to begin it's focus?\n\n \n Specific areas are of absolutely no interest to me at this stage. The diversity of life and origins of new species are explained so very eloquently by evolutionary theory to the almost unanimous approval of the scientific community that any other explanation seems futile. You propose to have another explanation. Let us read it in the words of your experts. \n \n \nBut as I have stated before I belive this issue to be a matter of faith, this will be harder to turn than any source I have.\n\n \n Right there you have just strayed from the issue at hand, and I won't stand for it, Lappster, I really won't! Forgive me for shouting, but I simply have no tolerance for this banter. You will recall what I wrote in the first post of this thread:\n \n \nSo because we are talking about subjects in the realm of scientific debate, you must therefore conduct your fight within the parameters of science: offer the evidence you propose to have collected.\n \n \n As much as you may want to believe that evolution is a matter of faith for the hardworking scientists who collect, analyze and test mountains of evidence during the courses of their careers, it is not, dammit! If they brought one iota of faith into the mix it would skew their results to the point of a total breakdown in the scientific establishment. Is this to say there have never been bad scientists and researchers? Of course not. There are good and bad, better and worse in every field. But science has a checks and balances system more strict than anything in any other field of human endeavor. If a scientist has so much faith in the truth of his hypothesis that he ignores gaping holes in the test results (if he is \"blinded by faith\", as it were), he would be discovered and revealed by his collegues. His findings would never be published. If he did this often enough, he would eventually find himself flipping burgers at Wendy's or posting articles on Christian websites about the lack of supporting evidence in favor of evolution. And no, \"established\" scientists are not the ones who follow the \"company line\" by any means. If it can be compared to a business, it's by far the most fair business going: if you propose a theory, show us the evidence so we can tear it up into tiny shreds and analyze it under electron microscopes, blow it up, stretch it out and pour sulfuric acid all over it. Let us spit on it, kick it, XXXX on it to see if it turns pale green or just smells funny. Let us dissect it into paper thin wafers and see if it tastes good or makes us drop dead or increases the immune response systems of rats. Let us jettison it into space and retrieve it twelve months later to see if an absence of gravity has effected its ability to regenerate limbs. After all is said and done, and if we generally accept your theory pending two or three hundred revisions, you get to start from scratch and we get to wait to do it all again. If we THEN accept your findings, there's a department of marine biology in Brussels and a research laboratory in Tokyo both waiting to put it through their meat grinders. And by the way, you're two months late on the electric bill. If you don't pay up by the 30th they're going to shut off the lights.\n \n This is only the life's work of people whose results you so casually disregard. To suggest that such a monumentally large establishment with such a mindboggling database of information and evidence is in some way fooling us or fooling itself or flat out wrong is to propose perhaps the single largest human blunder in history. Don't you think someone, somewhere along the way would have noticed this error and reversed the momentum? \n \n But if you have a whole line up of established sources who have in fact noticed the error and endeavor to reverse the momentum in favor of creationist science whose evidence is far more convincing, by all means let us begin our sorely needed education. But I warn you, the minute you bring faith into the equation you are going to quickly degenerate the debate into mudslinging and rabbit punches. Mark my words ... and just don't do it. Stick to the evidence, as that is the lifeblood of science. I promise you that when it comes time for us to debate about whether or not Christ walked on water, I will not even dare bring the word evidence into the mix, and all of my considerations will be on the basis of faith alone.\n \n Deal?\n \n \nI believe it will take several days to assemble the information available. My time cannot be entirely devoted to this issue\n\n \n That's fine. Take your time. I want you to come armed with the biggest guns and best ammunition possible. \n \n MQ",

   "I was wathching a movie today; and why I know that it is not scientific in documentaion the charachter made a comment which applies to the topic. The movies was \"Jurasic Park III\". Don't ack surprized that I watch this movie. I enjoy Sci-fi. The character said, \"Some boys want to be astronomers and others want to be astronauts.\" An astronomer studies form the safty of earth and therorizes. The astronaut take a leap of faith off of said theory and explores space. Both are science. In much the same way an architech plans a house and a carpenter builds it. If the faithless astronaut could never enter the heavens. Much of science stands on theory and acts, this is hardly the only example. If faith never enters the equation. then only theories exist. Few theories could be proven with out the faith in them required to prove them.\n \n I will offer evidence rather than faith in my posts. Faith cannot be argued, and I agree it has little place in a debate. If we are to come to any conclution faith would have to reenter the equation. This is however ages away from taking place.",

   "Okay Lappster. We're patiently awaiting your scientific evidence in support of creationism. Thank you.\n \n MQ\n \n P.S. - I understand your comments but disagree. To me, the evolutionist who goes out and collects the evidence to support his theory corresponds with your astronaut blasting off into the unknown. The creationist who is too afraid to investigate the world around him but prefers instead to base his entire belief on the theology inherent to his particular translation of a book corresponds to the astronomer who never leaves the confines of his planet. We could go back and forth on this forever, but it's really not important. I am more anxious to see the scientific evidence of creationism.",
