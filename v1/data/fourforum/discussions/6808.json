   "UN&#8217;s goals when created were to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations, achieve international cooperation, promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in attaining these common ends. The united nations continue to do their job and follows closely to the ideals they have set for themselves. In my speech I will elaborate on the following points in which to show why the Un SHOULD be the primary agent for the war on terror.\n \n &#8226; First of all is that the United Nations is not a colonizing Entity.\n \n &#8226; The definitions of War and Terror have no set boundaries and doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean what people portray them as.\n \n &#8226; The UN has the ability to legitimize actions and decisions unlike any group of nations or any single nation.\n \n First of all is the fact that the United Nations is not a colonizing entity. The UN is best qualified in assuring countries that their design is not taking over a country or taking their assets. Unlike other nations, when the UN intervenes it does not commence to accommodate it, although they may stay in a nation for a while to enforce and insure that things run smoothly. When a nation such as the Us stays in a country to long it begins to make the people of that nation feel a hatred or ANTI spirit which helps to multiply the number of Terrorists and increase the danger of Terrorist Attacks. Seeing that that UN is not a colonizing entity it would help prevent more terrorist organizations from spawning and decrease the danger of terrorist attacks.\n \n My second point is the Definition of War and Terror. The UN doesn&#8217;t actually have to be fighting with conventional armies to say that it is a war. War could mean compromising, treaties, and agreements on the best line of strategy which could help to eliminate terror. This would be a better line of approach to use because it would allow all nations to voice their opinion and balance cost, contributions, and much more. A lot of times nations use rash action or attack first before thinking, this can produce worse consequences than taking diplomatic action, determining the best line of strategy, and executing it which is what the UN is MEANT to do. The Definition of Terror is also up for deciphering. As Boaz Ganor said &#8220;Defining terror is not merely a theoretical issue, but an operative concern of the first order&#8221;. Since &#8220;Terror&#8221; is an INTERNATIONAL phenomenon, responses to terror must also be on an international scale. Without answering the question of &#8220;what is terror,&#8221; no responsibility can be imposed on countries supporting terror, and no steps can be taken to combat terrorist organizations and their allies. What one nation may consider terror another may not and consider the nation and their people attacking this national a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; thus creating more arguments, more war, and ultimately more terrorism. The UN is the ONLY organization that can agree on a definition because of the 191 members all being able to voice and opinion and decide what Terror is and what it isn&#8217;t.\n \n This leads me into my third and final point which is the UN&#8217;s ability to legitimize actions and decisions unlike any group of nations or any single nations. As Aldai E. Stevenson said &#8220;The whole basis of the United Nations is the right of all nations &#8211; great or small &#8211; to have weight, to have a vote, to be attended to, and to be part of the twentieth century.&#8221; The UN is a group of 191 member nations which organize themselves in international conferences which allows each nation to voice an opinion and help to establish the best angle and what to do based on ALL the nations opinions. What other organization allows 191 nations to come together peacefully and do this, the answer is none. Look at the United States, they only have one opinion or maybe a few so what they view as a threat or what not, other nations may not, the UN allows all nations to speak up, so all nations can decide on what to do rather than just a few.\n \n Also, when the resolution says &#8220;Primary Agent&#8221; IT DOES NOT MEAN THE ONLY AGENT. It also does not mean that the Primary agent has to be &#8220;fighting the war&#8221; or what not, as I said in my defining war point, they could be supplying people with resources, deciding the best line of strategy while other nations actually fought it. I&#8217;m not saying they can&#8217;t fight it if it comes to this because the UN does have the funds and resources available to fight the war on terror. \n \n Some people may claim the UN has had an overwhelming number of failures, but FAILURES AND SUCCESSES CAN BE SAID ABOUT ANY NATION! If you think about it, the media and such portray them as this horrible organization, but the fact of the matter is that the US and other nations have had a lot of failures also, they just aren&#8217;t publicized as much because the UN is a world organization say, everyone critics it. The UN has a good many success such as in Lebanon, Cyprus, the Golan, Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, Namibia, Angola, El Salvador, Cambodia, Somalia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Georgia, Liberia, Haiti, Tajikistan, the former Yugoslavia, Guatemala, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Eritrea, C&#244;te d'Ivoire, the Congo, India and Pakistan and East Timor, just in the last 20 years. Although some may not have been portrayed as Successes they surely were if you read between the lines you&#8217;ll see \"Ceasefire between Ethiopia and Eritrea Holds for 476th Consecutive Day,\" \"Zero Killed in Cyprus,\" or \"East Timor Still Functioning.\"\n \n The Key point is that the UN is effective; it is a place where nations can come together and voice opinions thereby developing a better plan of action, and has the funds necessary to support a global &#8220;War&#8221; on terror. This is a global war, and we need a GLOBAL organization therefore the effectiveness of the UN is undeniable and proves that the UN should be the primary agent for the &#8220;war&#8221; on terror.\n \n Best of luck to you ;).",

   "First, I'd like to thank my opponent, Rygar, for proposing this debate and for being flexible enough to take either the affirmative or negative position. This is my first attempt at debating using this particular format, so excuse me if I err. I'd also like to thank Billsco, once again, for setting up this debate, cajoling judges to judge, etc., \n \n The United Nations is incapable of taking the lead in the war on terrorism. Almost since its inception, the UN has placed a higher premium on pushing a socialist agenda than it has on solving conflicts. It's track record on solving political disagreements is marginal, at best, while it's ability to intervene in a timely manner to prevent mass murder is dismal. \n UN leadership is lacking, often corrupt and slow to respond when it does take action. For those reasons, it isn't capable of assuming a leadership role in the war on terror.\n \n Point 1.\n The UN places a higher premium on pushing a socialist agenda than it does on solving conflicts. The UN's major concern is promoting the UN and the interests of its members, many of which are under-developed nations. It is a policy making body and NOT a military one. The Kyota Accord is a good example of the type of socialist action that the UN proposes. Under the guise of preventing the mythical \"global warming\", it allows developing nations to generate as much greenhouse gases as it wants but financially penalizes developed nations for NOT reducing their current level of generation. This is nothing more than a scheme to redistribute wealth.\n Point 2\n The UN has an unlaudable record of solving international crises. Failures to quell terrorism in Israel, Afghanistan, Eastern Europe, numerous African nations and other areas around the world demonstrate that the UN lacks the tools necessary to take the lead role in fighting terrorism. \n Point 3\n Because of its size, the UN is unable to act quickly and decisively. The UN is a leviathan that is so mired in bureaucratic procedure and protocol that it is incapable of acting swiftly. A prime example is the UN's response in Rwanda. While 800,000 Tutsis were being systematically slaughtered by the Hitus, the UN was busy debating the definition of the term \"genocide\".\n Point 4\n UN leadership is corrupt. Kofi Annan and other top UN leaders have lost their credibility. The recent Oil for Food scandal is just the latest example demonstrating how member nations vote with their pocketbooks and not their morality. The fact that a single nation on the UN Security Council can veto UN actions has shown that all a rouge nation needs to do is \"buy\" one member of the security council in order to prevent UN actions. \n In summary, the UN is too large, ill-equipped, corrupt and slow to be an effective leader in preventing world terrorist activities. It's resolutions lack teeth, come too slowly and are rarely effectively enforced unless a member nation steps up and takes control.\n Terrorism may be a world-wide phenomenon, but response needs to be swift, effective and decisive. The UN is incapable of any of those three in a timely manner.",

   "Rygar,\n In your opening post you stated the following:\n \n\n The UN has a good many success such as in Lebanon, Cyprus, the Golan, Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, Namibia, Angola, El Salvador, Cambodia, Somalia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Georgia, Liberia, Haiti, Tajikistan, the former Yugoslavia, Guatemala, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Eritrea, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Congo, India and Pakistan and East Timor, just in the last 20 years. \n\n \n When I look at that list, I see a number of UN failures and some successes because some body, other than the UN, took charge.\n In Lebanon, the UN has allowed Syria and its proxy terrorist organizations to operate in the open without fear of retribution until very recently when it passed resolutions calling on Syria to allow an investigation into the assassination of Hariri and the disarmament of Hizbullah and other Palestinian terrorist organizations that have been operating under the UN's eyes for decades. And you list this as a success?\n \n http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unifil/unifilDrs.htm\n http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&categ_id=2&article_id=19834\n \n In Cambodia, the UN sat idly by while Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge committed genocide against 2 Million Cambodians. It wasn't for another 20 years that the UN was successful in helping to re-establish civil rule in Cambodia. We can't wait that long for the UN to effectively deal with terrorism.\n \n In Somalia, the UN was totally ineffective in even handing out food to the starving people of Somalia and I don't think that I need to recite the debachle that became of the peacekeeping mission.\n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ambush/etc/cron.html\n \n Rwanda was probably the most glaring example of the UN's ineptitude. \n Here's a portion of the Rwandan timeline for 1994. I've highlighted the UN's actions and inactions.\n \n\n January 5 Hutu militias disrupt the ceremony to install a broad-based transitional government. \n January 11 UNAMIR leader Gen. Dallaire sends urgent cable to U.N. outlining Hutu plans to exterminate Tutsis and his own plan to confiscate Hutu militia arm caches. He is told to desist -- as this would exceed his peacekeeping mandate -- and to discuss the issue with the Rwandan and foreign governments. \n \n February Series of massacres and political assassinations occur in the capital of Kigali and in Southern Rwanda, targeting Tutsis and Hutu members of opposition parties. Hutu extremists step up efforts to prepare death lists, import tens of thousands of machetes, and issue anti-Tutsi propaganda. \n \n April 6 Rwandan President Habyarimana and the Burundian President Ntaryamira are killed when Habyarimana's plane is shot down near Kigali Airport. The killings begin that night. \n \n April 7 Extremist Hutu forces set up roadblocks and go from house to house killing Tutsis and moderate Hutu politicians. Ten Belgian soldiers with UNAMIR, assigned to guard the moderate Hutu prime minister, are tortured and murdered. The prime minister is also murdered. \n \n April 8 Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) forces launch a major offensive to overthrow the interim government, reigniting the civil war. \n \n April 9-10 France, Belgium and Italy send troops to evacuate their citizens. Americans leave Rwanda by convoy to Burundi, where U.S. Marines wait. A handful of Rwandans escape with the Westerners. \n \n April 14 One week after the murder of the 10 Belgian soldiers, Belgium begins to withdraw forces from UNAMIR and urges the U.S. to support pulling out the rest of the peacekeepers. \n \n April 21 The U.N. Security Council votes unanimously to withdraw most of the UNAMIR troops, cutting the force from 2,500 to 270. \n \n May 17 The U.N. finally agrees to send 5,500 troops to Rwanda; however full deployment will not be complete until September--long after the genocide is over. \n \n Mid-May The International Committee of the Red Cross estimates 500,000 Rwandans have been killed. \n \n Mid-July Tutsi-led RPF forces capture Kigali. The Hutu government flees to Zaire, followed by a tide of refugees. The RPF sets up an interim government of national unity in Kigali. The genocide is over. An estimated 800,000 Rwandans have been killed in 100 days. \n \n November 8 Recognizing that serious violations of humanitarian law were committed in Rwanda, the Security Council creates the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). \n\n \n U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said, in an apology to the parliament of Rwanda, \"We will not deny that, in their greatest hour of need, the world failed the people of Rwanda....\"\n \n \n While 800,000 Rwandans were being systematically killed, the UN was busy debating the definition of genocide. \n \n\n \"I was not realizing that there was a real genocide,\" says Boutros Boutros-Ghali. \"Because there is a definition -- for us, genocide was the gas chamber, what happened in Germany. You need to have a sophisticated European machinery to do a real genocide. We were not realizing that with just a machete you can do a genocide. It takes time for us to understand.\"\n\n \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ghosts/viewers/\n \n Is this REALLY the organization that you want at the forefront of the war on terrorism?",

This would be a better line of approach to use because it would allow all nations to voice their opinion and balance cost, contributions, and much more.

Since \"Terror\" is an INTERNATIONAL phenomenon, responses to terror must also be on an international scale. Without answering the question of \"what is terror,\" no responsibility can be imposed on countries supporting terror, and no steps can be taken to combat terrorist organizations and their allies. What one nation may consider terror another may not and consider the nation and their people attacking this national a \"terrorist\" thus creating more arguments, more war, and ultimately more terrorism.

First, it'll spend 6 months debating the definition of terrorism just as it did during the Rwandan massacre arguing the definition of genocide. In the meantime, terrorism would go unchecked as the UN continued to be caught in analysis paralysis.\n Second, the UN is set up to deal with international disagreements between nations, not rouge organizations operating from within their borders that aren't linked to the official state government. Syria, Somalia and Sudan, for example, have/had terrorist organizations operating within their borders that weren't associated with the state government and were, therefore, impervious to UN sanctions against the states. This rendered the UN, as an organization, ineffective in dealing with them. As a result, individual nations took actions against terrorists unilaterally, in many instances, and were much more effective. Now, you might argue that some of those actions were UN-sanctioned activities and I would agree. But, knowing that the UN is incapable of quick, effective response in dealing with terrorism, wouldn't it be more efficient to eliminate the middle man entirely? Isn't the most efficient way to respond to terrorist acts to respond quickly and decisively against the rouge organizations, exactly the opposite of what the UN does best, act deliberately and at a high level?",

That way all nations get what they need and want rather than 1 nation achieving its interests while smashing someone elses. It also promotes the UN as to achieve international interest in achieving goals of nations all helping one another.\n \n\n There are several things wrong with each of the 191 nations only acting in theor own self interests. For one, it makes the concept of a timely response all but impossible. You can't get a consensus between 191 countries with varying opinions to agree to do anything timely. Secondly, there are 15 members of the UN Security Council (5 permanent, IRC) that have veto power over any action. As we've seen in Iraq, you only need to bribe one Security Council member (in this instance it was at least 2) in order to effectively block ALL UN actions. \n Thirdly, since nations will vote in their own self interests, many poorer nations will vote against actions that will result in increased financial burdens to themselves. Altruism has NEVER been a mainstay of the UN.\n \n\n Point 3\n Would you rather the UN attack rashly as in the US against IRAQ war where US charged in their without sufficient information and causing tons of controversy and creating deaths for no reason. Why not have a organization that debates about it, decides on the best plan of action, and then acting on it. And sometimes bureaucratic procedure is better than action. The Un has solved inumberable things through debates and talking it out which is much better than actually taking human lives to \"fix\" something.\n\n You're mistakenly attempting to argue that normal diplomatic practices will be effective when dealing with terrorism. Terrorists don't normally control the nation that houses them. While I'll admit that the UN has, occasionally, been able to solve long-standing international disagreements, we're not talking about nation vs nation conflicts. The UN has a dismal record handling civil wars, internat terrorism and even genocide from within the borders of a single country. \n And with respect to Iraq, the UN's inability to effectively deal with SH was precisely the reason that the US attacked Iraq. All of the UN Resolutions condemning SH were meaningless. SH threw out UN Inspectors on a number of occasions, continues to shoot at planes patroling the No-Fly Zone and diverted $Billions in OFF revenue away from humanitarian aid and right into SH's pockets. And even though the OFF program was a dismal failure (an estimated 500,000 Iraqi children alone starved annually under UN Sanctions) post Gulf 1, the UN was moving forward with plans to end the sanctions.\n \n\n Point 4\n ____________________\n The Top UN leaders are the ones that are already controlling this war on terrorism. The US, Great Britain, and other nations control this war as of now so basically you are saying that they are corrupt, thats just another reason to give it to the UN...even if they are corrupt inside the UN there is a system of checks and balances and so they if something is corrupt another nation can overule it. And the oil for food scandal, is not the UNs fault persay, actually they gave the money to Saddam for humanitarian aid, it is not their fault that he spent it incorrectly. Also, they got the majority of funds he stole back from it in the end. In Treachery by Bill Gertz, Bill outlines and uses primary documents to show how they got almost all the funds back as well as completely halted the Oil-For-Food policy.\n\n First, the top UN leader isn't controlling the war on terrorism already. Kofi Annan is the head of the UN and he has done little to nothing about terrorism except to line his pockets with SH's money via his son as have other top UN members such as Germany, France and Russia. The US and UK are controlling the war on terrorism for all intent and purpose. The reason is because the UN has failed to step up and enforce its own resolutions. UN Resolutions are meaningless pieces of hot air if members aren't willing to enforce them. And when you have bribed UN Security Members deliberately attempting to sabotage efforts designed to put pressure on a rouge nation, you are doomed to failure as an organization.\n I find your analysis of the OFF debachle interesting. If failing to enforce, or even audit effectively, the terms of sales of $Billions in oil under a UN program ISN'T the UN's fault, then who's is it?emoticon_wow \n And then claiming that the majority of funds diverted were ultimately returned and implying that this was \"OK\" begs a few questions. 1. If the funds were returned, how did SH build the $Billion Palace Complex recently turned over to the Iraqi people? Or are you saying that they really needed the oppulent palaces so it was OK for $Billions to be spent on them? 2. By stating that the UN halted the OFF program after years of corruption just reinforces my contention that it was a flawed plan from the beginning, doesn't it? And you STILL want this organization at the forefront of the war on terrorism? \n \n\n _______________________________\n Seeing that this is a World-Wide phenomenon, we need a world-wide organization, that being the UN. Whereas the United states or any other single nation or a few group of nations can only eradicate certain sections of terrorism groups or one or two groups, the UN (being an international body) can eradicate it everywhere due to its huge amount of funds, resources, the armies of all the nations inside it, and the fact that almost all the nations of the world are in it and can help point it out and zone in on each and every group.\n\n \n A quick search on Dogpile pulls up dozens of articles on the underfunding of the UN and its inability to fund its current programs. \n \n http://www.globalpolicy.org/finance/tables/index.htm\n http://www.oxfam.co.uk/press/releases/emergencyfund241005.htm\n http://www.globalpolicy.org/finance/info/agencies/2002/0712palestine.htm\n \n The belief that the UN has huge amounts of funds, resources and armies at its disposal is wishful thinking at best. The UN has an annual budget of $6.5Billion for all of its programs including peackeeping. This is about 5% of what the US has spent in the last 2 years in Iraq alone. The fact is that member nations aren't giving the UN the funding that they have requested as can be seen in the following:\n http://www.globalpolicy.org/finance/tables/sumbudgetanddebt.htm\n \n So, onbe again, I ask, is this underfunded, mismanaged, self-centered organization who you want in the forefront of the war on terrorism? \n \n Have a Happy Thanksgiving all.",

Whats wrong with that, do you think we should allow the United states to push only its interests or any single country for instance rather than all 191 member nations? That way all nations get what they need and want rather than 1 nation achieving its interests while smashing someone elses. It also promotes the UN as to achieve international interest in achieving goals of nations all helping one another.\n\n \n Here's just one example of where an individual nation's self-interests thwarted attempts to end the killing of 800,000 people. The reason that I keep coming back to Rwanda is because it clearly demonstrates, without argument, the inability of the UN to act swiftly, decisively and effectively when confronted with a crisis. \n When confronted with mounting evidence that a genocide was about to take place, UN members attempted to downplay the importance because they didn't want another Somalia. Once the genocide began, Rwanda, who happened to have a seat on the UN Security Council at the time, convinced the UNSC that the claims of genocide were exaggerated and that his gov't was handling the situation. France, not wanting UK and US troops in its sphere of influence in Africa, lobbied against any intervention.\n Finally, months later, the UN stated that \"acts of genocide may have been committed\". Of course, this revelation came AFTER the death of 800,000 Rwandans.\n \n\n UNAMIR's Force Commander General Dallaire became aware of plans for the genocide in January of 1994. He sent a cable to U.N. headquarters in N.Y. asking for permission to confiscate weapons. Throughout January, Februrary and March, he pleaded for reinforcements and logistical support. The UN Security Council refused. The United States refused to provide requested material aid after the failed US efforts in Mogadishu, Somalia. France, China and Russia opposed involvement in what was seen as an \"internal affair\". Dallaire was directly \"taken to task,\" in his words, for even suggesting that UNAMIR should raid Hutu militants' weapons caches, whose location had been disclosed to him by a reliable government source. Many U.N. officials, including Boutros Ghali, Kofi Annan and Booh-Booh were involved in watering down the response of the U.N. In the United States, Clinton and Albright refused to take action. Only Belgium asked for a strong UNAMIR mandate. After the murder of ten Belgium peacekeepers protecting the Prime Minister in early April, Belgium pulled out of the peacekeeping mission.\n \n The UN and member states appeared largely detached from the realities on the ground. In the midst of the crisis, Dallaire was instructed to have UNAMIR focus only on evacuating foreign nationals from Rwanda, and the change in orders even led Belgian peacekeepers to abandon a technical school filled with 2,000 refugees, while Hutu militants waited outside, drinking beer and chanting \"Hutu Power.\" After the Belgians left, the militants entered the school and massacred those inside, including hundreds of children. Four days later the Security Council voted to reduce UNAMIR down to 260 men.\n \n The administrative head of UNAMIR was former Cameroonian foreign minister Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, who has come under criticism for downplaying the significance of Dallaire's reports, and holding close ties to the Hutu militant elite.\n \n Following the Belgian forces' withdrawal after 10 soldiers were killed, General Dallaire consolidated his contingent of Canadian, Ghanaian, and Dutch soldiers in urban areas and focused on providing areas of \"safe control\". His actions are credited with directly saving the lives of 20,000 Tutsis.\n \n The new Rwandan government, led by interim President Th\u00e9odore Sindikubwabo, worked hard to minimize international criticism. Rwanda at that time had a seat on the Security Council and its ambassador argued that the claims of genocide were exaggerated and that the government was doing all that it could to stop it. Representatives of the Rwandan Catholic Church, long associated with the radical Hutus in Rwanda, also used their links in Europe to reduce criticism. France, which felt the United States and United Kingdom would use the massacres to try to expand their influence in that francophone part of Africa, also worked to prevent a foreign intervention.\n Finally, on April 29, 1994, the UN conceded that \"acts of genocide may have been committed.\" By that time, the Red Cross estimated that 500,000 Rwandans had been killed. The UN agreed to send 5,500 troops to Rwanda, most of whom were to be provided by African countries. The UN also requested 50 armoured personnel carriers from the United States. However, deployment of these forces was delayed due to arguments over their cost.\n \n On June 22, with no sign of UN deployment taking place, the Security Council authorized French forces to land in Goma, Zaire on a humanitarian mission. They deployed throughout southwest Rwanda in an area they called \"Zone Turquoise,\" quelling the genocide and stopping the fighting there, but often arriving in areas only after the Tutsi had been forced out or killed. Operation Turquoise is charged with aiding the Hutu army and fighting against the RPF. Due to confusion amongst French troops about what was actually going on, many Tutsi were massacred in French controlled areas.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide \n\n Here's what the Rwandan Foreign Minister said recently with regards to reforming the UN Security Council.\n \n \n\n UN MUST LEARN FROM MISTAKES, MORE EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT DECISIONS,\n FOREIGN MINISTER OF RWANDA TELLS GENERAL ASSEMBLY\n ......\n Referring to the \"responsibility to protect\" section in the 2005 World Summit Outcome that included a responsibility to prevent genocide, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing, the Foreign Minister said it had been his county's experience that, while the United Nations was immaculate in its values and principles, it had all to often been found wanting in its actions. Action, not words, would be the measure of the Organization's success or failure. A collective international response to genocide must include a responsibility for all States to combat impunity and bring to justice any persons accused of having committed such crimes.\n http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/ga10389.doc.htm\n \n\n \n \n To summarize:\n 1. The UN allowed individual members to thwart any attempt to end genocide\n 2. The UN's actions came too late to be of any good\n 3. The UN, although long on rhetoric, was found to be short on action.\n \n Again, is this the organization that you want to lead the war on terrorism?",

   "First, Very sorry for being away...I had some immediate family matters to attend to.\n \n Now to continue.\n \n \nYou're mistakenly attempting to argue that normal diplomatic practices will be \n \n effective when dealing with terrorism. Terrorists don't normally control the nation \n \n that houses them. While I'll admit that the UN has, occasionally, been able to solve \n \n long-standing international disagreements, we're not talking about nation vs nation \n \n conflicts. The UN has a dismal record handling civil wars, internat terrorism and even \n \n genocide from within the borders of a single country. \n And with respect to Iraq, the UN's inability to effectively deal with SH was precisely \n \n the reason that the US attacked Iraq. All of the UN Resolutions condemning SH were \n \n meaningless. SH threw out UN Inspectors on a number of occasions, continues to shoot \n \n at planes patroling the No-Fly Zone and diverted $Billions in OFF revenue away from \n \n humanitarian aid and right into SH's pockets. And even though the OFF program was a \n \n dismal failure (an estimated 500,000 Iraqi children alone starved annually under UN \n \n Sanctions) post Gulf 1, the UN was moving forward with plans to end the \n \n sanctions.\"\n\n \n _____________________\n I did not state that ONLY diplomatic action with be effictive in dealing with \n \n terrorism, I also stated that seeing that there are 191 member nations and all of them \n \n can pool their resources together, each nation within the UN can police its own \n \n country thereby controlling all the terroritories that the Terrorist organizations \n \n stay in rather than one nation going from country to country single handedly \n \n attempting to take out 1 terrorist organization after another, which seems to take \n \n longer than diplomatic action itself. If the UN is not to be the primary agent for \n \n this war on terrorism, I ask my opponent to please state who should? And also, I \n \n never stated that the UN should be the ONLY agent, I said they should be the \n \n PRIMARY AGENT, that could mean they solve all the diplomatic action required \n \n for fighting terrorism while other nations within the UN go and actually combat it. \n Here are a list of some diplomatic successes that definately prove it can be the \n \n Primary Agent for this war on terrorism:\n \n 1956: The Middle East \n The first peacekeeping force was deployed in the Sinai Peninsula in 1956, at the \n \n proposal of Canada's Foreign Minister, Lester Pearson. \n He suggested \"a truly international peace and police force... large enough to keep \n \n these borders at peace while a political settlement is being worked out\". \n Blue helments were chosen to distinguish UN soldiers from withdrawing troops\n The peacekeepers were to cover the withdrawal of British, French and Israeli forces \n \n from Egypt, following their invasion in the wake of the nationalisation of the Suez \n \n canal. \n The invading powers agreed to withdraw in return for certain promises which the \n \n peacekeeping forces were to guarantee. The UN deployed the United Nations Emergency \n \n Force, which kept the peace for 10 years. \n \n The United Nations and a host of other outside and inside powers struggle over the \n \n political future of Afghanistan, the subject of the West's last military intervention, \n \n Kosovo, has taken an extraordinary step toward stability. Last weekend the \n \n Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe successfully staged general \n \n elections for a provincial assembly, attracting a strong turnout not only from the \n \n majority ethnic Albanian population but from the Serb minority. The vote was free of \n \n violence, and attempts by militant Serbs to force a boycott failed miserably; many \n \n Serbs came out at nightfall, under cover of darkness, to cast their ballots. The \n \n outcome was a clear victory for political moderates -- the leading vote getter was the \n \n party of Ibrahim Rugova, a longtime advocate of democracy and peaceful reform. \n \n The organization played a constructive role in helping to end the armed conflicts \n \n in El Salvador and Mozambique and in supervising elections that brought independence \n \n and democracy to Namibia. Nevertheless, the failures are decidedly more spectacular \n \n than the successes and serve to emphasize the UN's inherent limitations. \n \n http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/peacekpg/us/00welch.htm is just another example.\n \n As you can see they do have the diplomatic experience in achieving goals as my \n \n opponent even agreed which further shows they can be the primary agent, which doesn't \n \n necessarily mean actually combating terrorism on a gun to gun scale (Even though they \n \n can and will if the need comes up.)\n \n To clear up the Iraqi war, The US went to war with IRAQ on FALSE PREMISES \n as stated in the first few paragraphs on the following link : \n \n http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/19472/\n \n The US never went to war on the premises that the UN was failing. and On the topic of \n \n the Oil for Food policy, The UN did get the Majority of Funds back and has been \n \n supplying people in iraq with Humanitarian aid.\n \n Also, In rwanda. Although it was somewhat of a failure, at least they ATTEMPTED to do \n \n something, if you look deeper into the topic all other countries that had armies there \n \n and such PULLED OUT before the genocide even started. Although the UN did not stop \n \n the RWANDA incident, but they did correct it in the end. They stayed in the country \n \n afterwards, rebuilding the government, and giving out huminitarian aid.\n \n \nFirst, the top UN leader isn't controlling the war on terrorism already. Kofi \n \n Annan is the head of the UN and he has done little to nothing about terrorism except \n \n to line his pockets with SH's money via his son as have other top UN members such as \n \n Germany, France and Russia. The US and UK are controlling the war on terrorism for all \n \n intent and purpose. The reason is because the UN has failed to step up and enforce its \n \n own resolutions. UN Resolutions are meaningless pieces of hot air if members aren't \n \n willing to enforce them. And when you have bribed UN Security Members deliberately \n \n attempting to sabotage efforts designed to put pressure on a rouge nation, you are \n \n doomed to failure as an organization.\n I find your analysis of the OFF debachle interesting. If failing to enforce, or even \n \n audit effectively, the terms of sales of $Billions in oil under a UN program ISN'T the \n \n UN's fault, then who's is it? \n And then claiming that the majority of funds diverted were ultimately returned and \n \n implying that this was \"OK\" begs a few questions. 1. If the funds were returned, how \n \n did SH build the $Billion Palace Complex recently turned over to the Iraqi people? Or \n \n are you saying that they really needed the oppulent palaces so it was OK for $Billions \n \n to be spent on them? 2. By stating that the UN halted the OFF program after years of \n \n corruption just reinforces my contention that it was a flawed plan from the beginning, \n \n doesn't it? And you STILL want this organization at the forefront of the war on \n \n terrorism? \n\n \n The top UN leader just is not the actual DECISION maker, the SECURITY council controls \n \n the UN and as far as I know the UK and US are on it. And did I ever say that it \n \n WASN'T the UNs fault for the O.F.F. And I stated that the MAJORITY of funds were \n \n taken back not all of them, and seeing that they got them back after that leaves time \n \n for SH to have spent some of them on his \"palaces\".\n \n \nThe belief that the UN has huge amounts of funds, resources and armies at its \n \n disposal is wishful thinking at best. The UN has an annual budget of $6.5Billion for \n \n all of its programs including peackeeping. This is about 5% of what the US has spent \n \n in the last 2 years in Iraq alone. \n\n \n As I look through these list of sources, I don't see as many shortfalls as you have \n \n claimed, and as I look deeper into the actual budget and debt of nations, I see that \n \n the two people controlling this war on terrorism are in HUGE amounts of debt and have \n \n less resources and such to pool from seeing they are concentrated on different things \n \n as of right now. The following link shows the amount of debt to the penny that the US \n \n is in:\n http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdpenny.htm\n \n Also, even if you claim that IRAQ does have a relation to terrorism, it seems the US \n \n and UK aren't doing a very good job as it is with resources:\n http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n13/harr04_.html\n \n \n As far as I'm concerned, the US and the UK are concentrated on the IRAQ not terrorism, \n \n so why I ask should we allow two nations to control this ENTIRE fight on terrorism who \n \n aren't actually fighting it. \n \n Also, the IRAQ WAR HAS NO RELATION TO TERRORISM. I'm pretty sure the the US was there \n \n to do what what was said in the link provided, in no way was it for TERRORISM \n \n (although they stated SH had relations with terrorism, that has been proven entirely \n \n false), which is what this debate is about, so please stop concentrating on IRAQ war \n \n and the Oil for food policy and start concentrating on Terrorism.",

   "First, my condolences on the loss of your grandfather.\n \n: \n \n First, Very sorry for being away...I had some immediate family matters to attend to.\n \n Now to continue.\n \n I did not state that ONLY diplomatic action with be effictive in dealing with terrorism, I also stated that seeing that there are 191 member nations and all of them \n \n can pool their resources together, each nation within the UN can police its own country thereby controlling all the terroritories that the Terrorist organizations \n \n stay in rather than one nation going from country to country single handedly attempting to take out 1 terrorist organization after another, which seems to take \n \n longer than diplomatic action itself. If the UN is not to be the primary agent for this war on terrorism, I ask my opponent to please state who should? \n\n The simple answer to your question is the nation being terrorized should have primary responsibility for dealing with terrorism within its borders. After all, it has the highest stake in insuring that a resolution is achieved. While the UN can debate the definition of genocide for months without consequence to the majority of its members, few involved nations have the luxury of that kind of time. Also, while we tend to think of terrorism as being \"global\", the predominant form of terrorism is local. AQ, for example, isn't terrorizing Nepal and the Khmer Rouge wasn't killing people in Indonesia. \n \nAnd also, I never stated that the UN should be the ONLY agent, I said they should be the PRIMARY AGENT, that could mean they solve all the diplomatic action required \n for fighting terrorism while other nations within the UN go and actually combat it. Here are a list of some diplomatic successes that definately prove it can be the \n \n Primary Agent for this war on terrorism:\n 1956: The Middle East \n The first peacekeeping force was deployed in the Sinai Peninsula in 1956, at the proposal of Canada's Foreign Minister, Lester Pearson. \n He suggested \"a truly international peace and police force... large enough to keep these borders at peace while a political settlement is being worked out\". \n Blue helments were chosen to distinguish UN soldiers from withdrawing troops.

The UN deployed the United Nations Emergency \n Force, which kept the peace for 10 years. \n \n\n Are you sure that you want to cite Israel as a diplomatic SUCCESS for the UN? Also, you are talking about an inter-national conflict, not intra-national one. Palestinians continue to terrorize Israel to this day and Israel continues to retaliate in kind. The UN has been totally ineffective in dealing with terrorism in Israel. \n \n\n The United Nations and a host of other outside and inside powers struggle over the political future of Afghanistan, the subject of the West's last military intervention, \n Kosovo, has taken an extraordinary step toward stability. Last weekend the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe successfully staged general \n elections for a provincial assembly, attracting a strong turnout not only from the majority ethnic Albanian population but from the Serb minority.

Nevertheless, the failures are decidedly more spectacular than the successes and serve to emphasize the UN's inherent limitations. \n http://www.globalpolicy.org/security...us/00welch.htm is just another example.\n\n Again, you cite examples of the UN's accomplishments that followed years of dealing ineffectively with genocide. I'm not arguing that the UN can't be effective in \"mopping up\" operations and restoring legitimacy to a country, I'm arguing that it is a leviathan, incapable of rapid deployment of resources necessary to be a primary agent in dealing with terrorism. 10 years after genocide began, Kosovo may have a stable gov't......but what about the intervening decade of mayhem in which the UN's efforts were ineffective in ending the violence?\n \n\n As you can see they do have the diplomatic experience in achieving goals as my opponent even agreed which further shows they can be the primary agent, which doesn't \n necessarily mean actually combating terrorism on a gun to gun scale (Even though they can and will if the need comes up.)\n\n What's needed to deal with terrorism is a quick reaction force. The UN has demonstrated that it isn't that entity. Its very nature is one of deliberation, compromise and consensus. This approach is needed but AFTER the fire has been put out not before. You don't send shock troops in after you've negotiated a treaty, for example. \n \n \n To clear up the Iraqi war, The US went to war with IRAQ on FALSE PREMISES as stated in the first few paragraphs on the following link : \n http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/19472/\n The US never went to war on the premises that the UN was failing. and On the topic of the Oil for Food policy, The UN did get the Majority of Funds back and has been \n supplying people in iraq with Humanitarian aid.\n\n Not true, but also irrelevent to the current discussion. Some of the reasons for the US invading Iraq are 1. because the UN inspectors were sent packing by SH on several occasions and the world intelligence didn't believe that they were effective while there. 2. The UN was unable to prevent SH from shooting at planes patrolling the No-Fly Zone. 3. Members of the UN wanted sanctions removed despite the abuses of the OFF program being carried out by SH.\n \n \n Also, In rwanda. Although it was somewhat of a failure, at least they ATTEMPTED to do something, if you look deeper into the topic all other countries that had armies there \n and such PULLED OUT before the genocide even started. Although the UN did not stop the RWANDA incident, but they did correct it in the end. They stayed in the country \n afterwards, rebuilding the government, and giving out huminitarian aid.\n\n So, in your opinion, it's OK for the UN to allow 800,000 people to be killed in a couple of months while they debate the definition of genocide as long as they do something a decade later? And you are in error on the basic facts surrounding the massacres in Rwanda. Many of the massacres occurred in UN refugee camps under the eyes of UN troops. \n As referenced earlier:\n \n\n On June 22, with no sign of UN deployment taking place, the Security Council authorized French forces to land in Goma, Zaire on a humanitarian mission. They deployed throughout southwest Rwanda in an area they called \"Zone Turquoise,\" quelling the genocide and stopping the fighting there, but often arriving in areas only after the Tutsi had been forced out or killed. Operation Turquoise is charged with aiding the Hutu army and fighting against the RPF. Due to confusion amongst French troops about what was actually going on, many Tutsi were massacred in French controlled areas.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide \n\n \n \n: \n The top UN leader just is not the actual DECISION maker, the SECURITY council controls the UN and as far as I know the UK and US are on it. And did I ever say that it \n WASN'T the UNs fault for the O.F.F. And I stated that the MAJORITY of funds were taken back not all of them, and seeing that they got them back after that leaves time \n for SH to have spent some of them on his \"palaces\".\n\n I have already pointed out the problems that exist within the UN Security Council. Any member can effectively block UN action. In Rwanda, we saw that Rwanda was on the UNSC and delayed UN response to the genocide there. With Iraq, we saw Germany, France and Russia effectively block any UN actions against SH because of their illegal oil deals.\n \n \n\n As I look through these list of sources, I don't see as many shortfalls as you have claimed, and as I look deeper into the actual budget and debt of nations, I see that \n the two people controlling this war on terrorism are in HUGE amounts of debt and have less resources and such to pool from seeing they are concentrated on different things \n as of right now. The following link shows the amount of debt to the penny that the US \n is in:\n http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdpenny.htm\n \n Also, even if you claim that IRAQ does have a relation to terrorism, it seems the US and UK aren't doing a very good job as it is with resources:\n http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n13/harr04_.html\n \n As far as I'm concerned, the US and the UK are concentrated on the IRAQ not terrorism, so why I ask should we allow two nations to control this ENTIRE fight on terrorism who \n aren't actually fighting it.

The topic of this debate is Terrorism. I have shown that the UN has been ineffective in dealing with terrorism in Cambodia, Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, East Timor, Ivory Coast and a host of other areas. The reasons are varied, but do follow a few main themes:\n 1. The UN is constructed to deal with nations, not rouge elements within sovereign nations.\n 2. The UN operates in a slow deliberate way. This is the anti-thesis of what is needed in dealing with terrorist flare-ups.\n 3. Invividual members of the UNSC can thwart any and all UN actions with a single veto.\n 4. The UN is composed of politicians NOT military tacticians or strategists.\n 5. The UN doesn't have the financial resources to lead the global war on terrorism nor the financial commitment of its 191 member nations to do so.",
