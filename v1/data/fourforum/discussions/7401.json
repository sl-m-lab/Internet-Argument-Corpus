I am sure that Vatican's Evolutionists will one day declare St. Peter as the First Communist and Communism as perfectly compatible with the Bible.

   "I recently read somewhere that Darwin was a Christian when he penned \"Origin\" and only became an atheist later.\nDarwin didn't actually write about it. At one point he did claim to be an agnostic (a word coined by his friend, T.H. Huxley) rather than atheist. We do know that Darwin had worked out the basic premises of natural selection by 1844 when he made his theory known to Sir Joseph Hooker. Hooker urged Darwin to publish. The one event that is believed to have been a blow to Darwin's faith was the death of his daughter, Annie in 1851. In 1849, Annie, along with two sisters and a younger brother, contracted scarlet fever. The younger brother (Charles Waring) died. In 1851, Annie became ill and finally died. It may have been tuberculosis. Annie (#2) was Darwin's favorite (a fact that Henrietta (#4) always resented) and it may have been her death that soured Darwin on Christianity. While his wife cared for the other children, Darwin nursed Annie. It is likely that he prayed while watching Annie die.\n \n On the Origin of Species was published in 1859. How much of \"Origin\" was \"penned\" prior to 1851 is unknown. Certainly much of the work was done late on, close to publication.\n \n Darwin had 10 children. 3 died as children, the rest lived well into the 20th century. Two (Sir George Howard Darwin, FRS and Sir Francis Darwin, FRS) were knighted, as was Sir George's son, Sir Charles Galton Darwin, FRS.",
