   "Saw them last night. :p \n \n I've wanted to see them live since I was in high school and never had the chance until now. I was going to fly to Minneapolis with a buddy of mine for their stop there on the Monster tour, but we calfed out, it's one of my biggest concert going regrets.\n \n Anyhoo, they were awesome. I still can't get over how good they sounded live, better than the records, and the sound in the Saddledome is terrible, which makes it all the more impressive. IMHO, the defining mark of a truly great band.\n \n I'm not crazy about their last couple of albums, but they played a great mix of new and old, the new stuff was surprisingly good, and the old stuff was amazing.\n \n If they're in your area, do yourself a favour and get a ticket. It's a show not to be missed.\n \n Waxy",
