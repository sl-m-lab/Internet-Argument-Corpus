   "US: Nuclear technologies for sale\n Something very odd has been happening of late in Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. To make it plain, the US Department of Energy found itself under a close attention of the US secret service Dep. Actually, they are currently examining the licensing procedure of the companies that have access to nuclear technologies and supply them to foreign countries.\n Due to some information from the US State Dep., in the result of some omittance in the work of certain companies that cooperate with Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore Institutes, their Indian partner companies got access to classified information and technologies in nuclear field. \n Currently, the State Dep. is examining the version that the employees of Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories were bribed by their Indian partners.\n One way or another, the US State Dep. is seriously intending to find the guilty. It raises no doubts that the accidents of the kind seriously threaten the US security.",
