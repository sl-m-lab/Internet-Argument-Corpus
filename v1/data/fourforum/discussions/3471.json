   "Halloween has a way of separating people into camps. Some see it as a fun, for-the-kids, one-night celebration. Others detect a sinister element to it. They often have a Christian-based complaint about the practice, and sometimes prohibit their children from participating.\n \n This year it falls on a Sunday and, as a result, has some very concerned:\n \n http://ap.tbo.com/ap/breaking/MGBIQ3MNC0E.html\n http://www.2theadvocate.com/stories/101604/new_mask001.shtml\n \n What are your thoughts about Halloween?",

   "Imagination - without it life is so boring.\n \n But, Halloween is for kids - sort of. It's coupled with \"that time of year\" and has no religious meaning to my kids or me. I carve ugly, scary pumpkins, help the kids look their scariest and sit back - waiting to do a little tricking myself. :)\n \n The kids gather round and listen to my ghost stories (which I can tell with such enthusiasm) and gasp at each high point. Then, with my subtle prompting, tell their own, which is much more funny than scary &#8211; but I can pretend, too.\n \n A friend of mine once, who was scared of his own shadow, was asked to play the Headless Horseman for the kids in the community. He saddled his horse, donned the cape with a round piece of cardboard fashioned at the neckline to extend above his head, and waited for the hay wagon to pass by. He said while he waited he felt someone looking over his shoulder and felt sure it was the real Headless Horseman. The more he waited the more frightened he got. Soon he had totally convinced himself that he was being watched and that he was sure to be decapitated. It was determined beforehand that when the wagon rounded the curve that he would begin making ghoulish screams and gallop the horse up to the wagon. This was not to happen exactly as planned. As soon as the wagon came around the corner, and knowing what he agreed to do, he let out a somewhat weak moan. However, instead of scaring the kids, his own creepy moans (he said) sounded like they came from someone else. Instantly frightened he let out a whoop and tried to remove the cape and cardboard, which then became entangled in the reins. The horse spooked and began prancing wildly &#8211; he screamed louder &#8211; the horse panicked, and they both went racing past the wagon, cape flying, man howling. The children, who were genuinely frightened, went down to the floor of the trailer screaming bloody murder. The three parents aboard, while having a good laugh (they were in on the plan), began consoling the children as the Headless Horseman finally passed from sight around the curve. About a half-hour later the guy that played the part came back leading his horse, sniffling, white as a ghost, and said he would never do that again. His wife later told us he was sick to his stomach all that night.\n \n True story. And I laugh still &#8211; even as I typed this.",
