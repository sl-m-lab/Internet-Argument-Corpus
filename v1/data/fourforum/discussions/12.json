A scientific theory is an explanation of observations that has been tested.\n \n \nThe difference is that the former group believes \"In the beginning God...\" and the latter, \"In the beginning dirt...\"\n\n \n Nonsense. There are some respected evolutionary biologists who are religious. Ken Miller of Brown University, for example, is a Christian who believes in creation by God. The debate isn't whether but how.

   "Factual? Last time I checked, it was the THEORY of evolution, not the LAW of evolution.\n\n \n Possibly if you went to the \"What is science\" thread you might learn a thing or two. In science, theories don't grow up to be laws. Theories are much larger and more complex ideas than laws. In science, a law is a simple statement of limited application. Laws are generally simple and the result of observation.\n \n A theory, in science, is as good as it gets. A theory is the result of intense testing of a prediction that was based on a hypothesis that explained observations. Science is constantly testing its theories. Some scientific theories are so well established that many people actually think that they are facts. The last time you checked it was the theory of gravity, the heliocentric theory, the germ theory of disease, the theory of relativity. All of science is theory.\n \n \nEvolution and Creation are both theories, neither of them can be proved scientifically per se.\n\n \n Here's how science works. An observation is made. A proposed explanation is offered (hypothesis). A prediction is made of something that is a consequence of the hypothesis. In science it is said that the prediction has the ability to falsify the hypothesis. The prediction is tested. Hypotheses that have been strongly tested are called theories. Evolution is a theory about how and why living things change through time.\n \n If creation is a theory, then there should be observations and predictions that can falsify the theory. If creation is a theory, then all who hold that theory also accept the possibility that it may be wrong, that there is some as yet unobserved fact that can disprove it.",

   "Originally posted by American \n Where did the dirt come from?\n \n \n \n Well, the short version is that shortly after the big bang, the universe was filled by a hot quark plasma. As it expanded and cooled, the process of nucleosynthesis produced the primordial elemental abundance, primarily hydrogen, with some deutirium, helium, and lithium. The physics is well understood, and verified by observation. Quantifying uncertainties in primordial nucleosynthesis without Monte Carlo simulations \n \n At roughly a billion years of age, stars and galaxies formed, some fraction of the stars that formed were massive supergiants, that burned up their hydrogen into other elements, up to the atomic number of iron. This occurred at a tremendous rate and in a few more billion years, these stars went supernova and exploded. Prior to going supernova, these stars go through a phase where the outer layers of the star are shed, providing ways to transport the lighter elements away from the star. You can see this in the following link:\n Hubble Chemically Analyzes the Ring around Supernova 1987A \n \n The trememdous radiation of the supernova permits the formation of elements with atomic numbers higher than iron. The force of these explosions scattered the newly created elements, creating vast gas and dust clouds. Eventually, the shockwave of another explosion initiated the collapse of one of these clouds, and the spinning hydrogen cloud begins to heat , eventually initiating nuclear fusion, and becoming our sun. As the sun began to increase it's heat output, the volatile remains of the accretion disk are driven away from the inner portion of the solar system, leaving mostly heavy elments. Comets bombarded the inner solar system, transporting water, carbon, and amino acids to the newly forming earth, making dirt.\n \n In short, a truely wonderful creation.",

   "Thank you Lurch. You have gotten to my point: Evolution (as taught in modern public school textbooks) is a religion, not a scientific fact (as claimed by sarablaze).\n\n \n So what you are saying is that even though you claimed to have studied evolution, you have not. I understand.\n \n In fact, my religion is not evolution. I even hold my religion in higher regard than to consider using it as an insult. Since you think that calling science a religion is an insult, your religion must be trivial and largely meaningless.\n \n But that aside, since you want to lump all of science into the word \"evolution\" so that you can reject it all at once, I'm just going to use the word science. sarablaze isn't a scientist and, like you, has probably had very little scientific education. But I'm going to try to explain to you again.\n \n A religion is held by faith. That means that it is not supported by actual evidence. On the other hand, science is not accepted by faith since it is built on a process of questioning and testing everything. There is nothing in science that I \"believe\". Do I believe that the earth orbits the sun? No. But when presented with the observations of the relative positions of the sun and planets, the most parsimonious explanation is that it is so. I accept that and will accept that until someone can present more evidence and a better explanation. That is true of all science. I don't believe any of it but accept the explanations that have been tested that account for the observations.\n \n In science, by the way, the facts are the observations - not the theories. So the facts of gravity are the observations of things falling to earth and observations of the relative positions of the planets. The current theory of gravity only imperfectly explains those facts - it is part of the general theory of relativity developed by Einstein.\n \n In biology, the facts are that we observe living things to change over time. We even have facts from many different fields (biogeography, genetics, molecular biology, population genetics, morphology, embryology, paleontology, and others) that point to the fact that living things change over time. The explanations of the mechanics of those changes form the theory of evolution.",

   "Has anyone ever observed one animal change into another animal?\n\n Yes. For example, the hawthorn maggot fly was observed to change into the apple maggot fly in only a few years. I also gave the example of the herring gull/lesser black-backed gull that exists as a single, continuous population the circles the globe in which the extremes have become seperate species.\n \n Of course, what you are asking is if it has ever been observed that a frog turned into a lion. But that isn't evolution. In fact, a saltation (that is the word for that silly idea) would disprove the current theory of evolution. Organisms change only a little from generation to generation. Generally, evolution is a slow process since it happens in populations, not individuals. Evolution is a change in the genetic makeup of the entire population of over generations.\n \n \nWhen you talk about changing a species how is the changing being done? By some natural process or is man doing this through manipulation and breeding?\n\n Both. But artificial manipulation of domestic animals is a drop in the bucket. But still, by selecting desirable traits in animals, humans are able to produce whole populations of animals that have those traits. There are several mechanisms that have an effect on the genetic makeup of a population of organisms. Some of them increase the genetic variability in a population and then others act on the variability. Probably the two most important mechanisms are mutation and natural selection. Mutations are mistakes that occur as the DNA is copied when cells reproduce. When these mutations happen in the germ cells, it is passed on to the off spring. Consider that there are an average of 100 genetic mutations between any two parents and a given child. Natural selection is the statisticl tendency of organisms with certain charistics to produce more offspring. Advantageous characteristics that arise through mutation will tend to give a survival advantage to the organism. Of course, they must reproduce.\n \nHow does being able to produce a fruit fly that won't eat meat as opposed to a fruit fly without wings prove evolution? They are both still fruit flies, aren't they?\n\n But the genetic makeup of the population has changed. There are several strains of fruit flies that can be purchased that will no longer interbreed with wild fruit flies or with each other. Since there is no longer any exchange of genetic information between these populations (gene flow), there is nothing to prevent them from accumulating differences.\n \n On the other hand, when you consider that there are between 5 and 30 million species in the world today, to say nothing of the extinct species that we know about, even creationists claim that 36 species of cat evolved from a single pair in a couple thousand years. Or 850 species of bat, from fruit bats to vampires, in that time. That is evolution faster than any evolutionary biologist would ever imagine.",

   "Actually, I never asked if anyone had seen a frog turn into a lion. I do believe I asked if anyone had observed a fish turn into a frog though.\n\n Same question. Both are versions of the cartoon version of evolution that creationists have come up with. As I explained, if you observed any such thing, the theory of evolution would be falsified.\n \nOkay, so you say that evolution is a slow process that changes \"the genetic makeup\" of some population of some animal over generations. Fine, all I am asking is that you point out to me where man has actually observed and recorded evidence of one specific type of animal eventually turning into another completely different kind of animal. I am assuming that according to evolution this had to happen in order to explain all of the different kinds of animals that are present today.\n\n I gave you several examples of changes that occurred in a time frame that could be observed. Once two lineages are reproductively isolated then they will continue to accumulate differences. If you could stick around long enough and neither lineage became extinct, perhaps they would become different enough to satisfy you that they are different \"kinds\" of animals. Of course, you don't specify what you mean by \"completely different kind of animal.\" A whale and a hippo are both vertebrates and mammals. In fact, a fish and a frog are both vertebrates too.\n \n I do notice that you actually asked for evidence of a process that took hundreds of thousands or millions of years to happen millions of years ago. That is a step up from the usual demand for observation of the actual events. If your question is whether we can show examples of organisms that have characteristics that would be expected if, for example, birds evolved from a lineage of theropod dinosaurs, the answer is yes. Try going to the Dinosauricon to check out the following: Eoraptor, Herrerasaurus, Ceratosaurus, Allosaurus, Compsognathus, Sinosauropteryx, Protarchaeopteryx, Caudipteryx, Velociraptor, Sinovenator, Beipiaosaurus, Sinornithosaurus, Microraptor, Archaeopteryx, Rahonavis, Confuciusornis, Sinornis, Patagopteryx, Hesperornis, Apsaravis, Ichthyornis.\n \n Here's some pictures of some of the Chinese feathered dinosaurs. China's Feathered Dinosaurs. They have found even more than these, including some primitive birds.\n \n Of course you realize that there is no claim that each of these is the ancestor of the previous animal. We have no way to know that. What they do show is the change of morphology from one \"kind\" of animal to another. The bird doesn't spring from a reptile egg in one generation. But animals like Archaeopteryx had teeth (no beak), a long tail of free vertebrae, gastralia, fibula, three fingered claws, pre-orbital fenestra, free metacarpals, free metatarsals, and other characteristics of a theropod. And yet it had feathers, furcula, opposable hallux and other features of bird. And evolutionary theory expects such transitionals, animals that show a mixture of characteristics of two lineages.\n \nI am not talking about mutations. \"How can mutations (recombining of the genetic code) create any new, improved varieties?\"\n\n Argument by misdefinition. Recombination is another mechanism of evolution. Recombination is not mutation. Essentially you are defining mutation as sexual reproduction. Recombination is the process by which the set of genes from each parent are recombined and then passed on. A mutation is a change in the structure of the DNA. There are several kinds - point mutation, translocation, inversion, deletion, insertion. Creating something new is actually fairly simple. Duplication and mutation. The process has been observed. And mutation is only one of the mechanisms that increase the genetic variability of a population. It is also increased by gene flow and of course, recombination.\n \nI am not talking about natural selection. \"Natural selection only works with the genetic information available and tends only to keep a species stable. How would you explain the increasing complexity in the genetic code that must have occurred if evolution were true?\" \n\n If you are talking about evolution then you are talking about natural selection. Natural selection tends to adapt an organism to the environment. In other words, those combinations of genes that offer the best chances for survival will tend to produce more off spring. Sometimes populations remain fairly stable for long periods and well adapted species will tend to remain fairly stable. But environments change and those organisms that have the most genetic diversity will more easily adapt.\n \n Moreover, to claim that change is impossible because natural selection tends to maintain stability is silly. Let me see. Since college graduates tend to make more money than high school dropouts, it must be true that I make more money than all high school dropouts.\n \n And finally, when offered mutation as a source of genetic diversity you reject it because you don't understand how it can \"create new varieties,\" and you reject natural selection because you don't understand where the diversity comes from. By the way, evolutionary theory doesn't include any concept of \"improved\" species. A lion isn't a better tiger, just different, even though they are so closely related that they can interbreed. And a Polar Bear is not an \"improved\" Brown Bear - it is just adapted to a different environment.\n \nSurely scientists have been making observations long enough to have the kind of written evidence that I am asking for.\n\n Sure. And the information is available if you want to seek it out. There is not question that evolution, according to the definition, occurs. That is a fact. Populations of animals change and sometimes sub-populations become reproductively isolated and they eventually are no longer able to interbreed. But that takes time. And if we apply what we see happening in the world today to the past, and we examine the fossil record, morphology, and the structure of DNA we find that common descent explains the observations. So evolutionary biologists agree that all 36 species of cat and all of the subspecies have probably descended from some common population of cat-like animal. But given the speed with which these evolutionary changes seem to have taken place, it is impossible for all cats to have descended from a pair the left a boat in Asia Minor about 4500 years ago.\n \n Here are a couple of pieces that you can read that might get you up to speed on what evolution is and how it works. Introduction to Evolutionary Biology, Five Major Misconceptions about Evolution, 29+ Evidences for Macroevolution, Transitional Vertebrate Fossils FAQ.\n Most of the articles at that site were written by professionals. There are lots of links to information on other sites. If you want, I'll suggest a couple of introductory books.\n \nAlso, does anyone know exactly how long this \"evolutionary\" process takes?\n\n Usually it takes a long time. Small changes in populations happen in a few years. Peppered moths changed from a light morph to black (98%) in Great Britain in about 50 years. After about 50 years they changed back again to the light morph, so that the black morph is very rare again. The difference between the light and the black is a single point mutation of a single gene. The same mutation has been observed in other closely related species of moth.\n \nWhat will these fruit flies eventually turn into besides fruit flies? Does anybody know?\n\n Of course not. But we do know that once reproductively isolated, the changes in the different lineages will happen independently.",

At this time the theory of creationism was thoroughly rejected by the scientific community. Darwins Theory of Evolution only reinforced this conclusion. So the theory of creationism was falsified, proven to be wrong, about 200 years ago. No serious scientist has considered it since then. That's why I said it should not be taught in science class.

   "WHO COULD ARGUE WITH TEACHING GOOD SCIENCE?\n - BTG No. 166b October 2002\n by John D. Morris, Ph.D.*\n \u00a9 Copyright 2003 Institute for Creation Research. All Rights Reserved.\n Earlier this year House Bill 481 was submitted to the Ohio State Assembly. The bill addresses the issue of teaching \"origins science\" in the Ohio public schools. The carefully crafted bill scrupulously follows the intent of recent Supreme Court decisions and attempts to implement the 2002 U.S. Education Bill, specifically its Santorum Amendment. \n Quoting directly from HB 481: \n It is the intent of the general assembly that to enhance the effectiveness of science education and to promote academic freedom and the neutrality of state government with respect to teachings that touch religious and non-religious beliefs, it is necessary and desirable that \"origins science,\" which seeks to explain the origins of life and its diversity, be conducted and taught objectively and without religious, naturalistic, or philosophic bias or assumption. To further this intent, the instructional program provided by any school district or educational service center shall do all of the following: \n (A) Encourage the presentation of scientific evidence regarding the origins of life and its diversity objectively and without religious, nat-uralistic, or philosophic bias or assumption; \n (B) Require that whenever explanations regarding the origins of life are presented, appropriate explanation and disclosure shall be provided regarding the historical nature of origins science and the use of any material assumption which may have provided a basis for the explanation being presented; \n (C) Encourage the development of curriculum that will help students think critically, understand the full range of scientific views that exist regarding the origins of life, and understand why origins science may generate controversy. \n Those who follow the creation/evolution controversy will not be surprised that this bill has generated much criticism and opposition. Nor will they be surprised at the list of insecure evolution proponents involved, for the same names crop up at every opportunity, fighting to maintain their total monopoly on evolution teaching and propaganda in the schools. \n However, a growing number of legislators as well as the people of America are recognizing that evolution is really the anti-Christian religion of naturalism, and that its vocal adherents behave more like Darwinian evangelists than scientists. By insisting on false evolutionary arguments being included in the textbooks and excluding even that scientific evidence which doesn't fit evolution, they expose their baseless bias. \n Note that the bill does not mandate teaching either scientific or Biblical creation-it only seeks honest, healthful science. It removes religion from the schools, for dogmatic exclusive evolution teaching is religious teaching. \n The high priests and priestesses of evolution have everything to lose and nothing to gain by returning to good science. The classroom would no longer be their pulpit. And that's why they oppose HB 481! And that's why creationists need to support it!",

   "How interesting that neither lappster nor John Morris is aware that the Santorum Amendment was removed from Public Law 107-110 as passed by the 107th Congress.\n \n Morris fails to show why this language is an effort to follow recent Supreme Court decisions. To my knowledge, the SCOTUS has found in all cases that evolution is science and as such should be taught in the science curriculum of public schools. In those cases, creationism or references to creationism have been found to be religious and are therefore prohibited from inclusion in science curriculum in the public schools.\n \n Of course, Morris' purpose is to remove the teaching of any science that conflicts with his primitive religion. Since the teaching of his religion as science has been disallowed, Morris (and others) try to pretend that the teaching of evolution is religion. Is it intentional or merely a lack of effort that Morris doesn't understand the methodological naturalism is not a philosophy or a religion.\n \n But it is really sad that Morris pretends that HB 481 is an effort to conform to to 2002 U.S. Education Bill (Public Law 107-110), \"specifically its Santorum Amendment.\" As mentioned, the Santorum Amendment is not part of the bill as signed by the President. Why would anyone be concerned with complying with parts of a bill that don't exist? Both ICR and AIG claim that the Santorum Amendment was part of this bill. Surely, since it has been pointed out to them that they are wrong on several occasions, their continued claims must be intentional misrepresentation.\n \n Anyone who is in doubt about that can check it out at http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ110.107.pdf \n \n We should probably accept that lappster is just a dupe of the likes of Morris. Lappster probably thought that the Santorum Amendment was part of PUBLIC LAW 107-110 because he believes what people like Morris tell him.\n \n I assume that Morris' reference to the \"2002 U.S. Education Bill\" is actually a reference to PUBLIC LAW 107-110, since the \"Santorum Amendment\" was attached to that law before it was deleted in committee. When this matter was discussed before the Ohio Board of Education, this was pointed out the them by Dr. Kenneth Miller (a Christian and biologist). Claims were made that Dr. Miller had scanned only the first 600 pages of the bill and that the Santorum text is on page 703. Actually, Dr. Miller scanned all of the bill, all 670 pages. \n \n Why is it that creationists don't seem to feel the need to be honest?",

   "Why is it that creationists don't seem to feel the need to be honest?\n \n My favourite example of deliberate deceit by Magical Creationists is the Big Lie that Dinosaurs and men coexisted. In the 1980s there were the footprints found near Glen Rose, Texas, in the Paluxy River bed. At first glance the footprints looked to be a large herbivorous dinosaur along side smaller foot prints that looked somewhat like a human foot in shallow prints. But Magical Creationists jumped on the finding as evidence for the co-existence of Dinosaurs and humans before Noah's Flood.\n \n But anatomists felt that they didn't look exactly human. They led down a sloping sedimentary rock into the stream under water. So they dammed the stream exposing the tracks under the water covered by sediment. When the sediment was swept away by brooms, it exposed the full prints. The prints were deeper there as though the ancient Jurassic mud was softer down into the stream bed.\n \n The large prints were definitely a large sauropod dinosaur. The smaller prints now more defined were definitely those of a small carnivorous raptor dinosaur. Each of its prints now had three deep claw marks in front. They were definitely not human. They are unmistakably dinosaurian now. \n \n Sadly disinformationists in the Creationist movement pretend that their HOAX has not been exposed. They simply won't admit it. They continue to tell the falsehood. They say the prints indicate that dinos and man lived side by side. They fail to admit that the claim has been long ago disproved on this site by revealing the smaller prints to be dinosaurian not human. The idea of man living 100 million years ago is ludicrous anyway. But the faith of True Believers is not swayed by physical evidence contrary to their myth system.\n \n If people will kill for Christ, what is such a big deal about lying for Christ.\n \n Cuchulainn",

   "Oh dear.\n \n Do you actually know what a scientist means when they call something a \"theory\"? Because it seems to me that you do not. The concept of gravity is \"only a theory\", yet oddly enough I don't see anyone trying to say that we should stop accepting the existence of the force of gravity because of this. \n \n The SCIENTIFIC theory of Evolution is a scientific theory that has been and continues to be extensively researched and developed. It should be taught in schools.\n \n Creationism (or Intelligent Design) is not a scientific theory, and is not supported by any evidence. If it must be allowed into schools at all it should be confined to the religious studies classroom, not the science laboratory.\n\n \n \n This is an old thread.. Don't expect an answer from Patriot, it looks like the last time he posted here was in 2003.",
