   "Is here anyone who can explain me in a few words what happened in the Middle East? I watch the news and understand that it is all hell and chaos there. Israel and Lebanon bombard each other with numerous casualties among peaceful populace on both sides. Is this all because of abduction of two soldiers by Hizbollah? Oh no, I don't think this was the exact reason. Anyway, it must be a too strong reaction by Israel, don't you think? If every kidnapping results into a large-scale warfare, what will the world look like? Surely, I do not justify Hizbollah and Hamas, these two are extremist organizations, but Israel really went too far!! I'm sure that if America had pulled ropes in time, Israel would think twice before attacking Lebanon. But they did not, and I'm sure this was done intentionally so that to trigger off war in Palestine. Huh, Israel was simply a blind weapon in hands of Americans, mind my words! If only the US did not OK the conflict, there wouldn't be any! \n \n So far, we got another scene of conflict in the Middle East which makes oil advance in price above $80 a barrel. Thank you Bush and pest on you, XXXXX!",

   "Al Qaeda hits America 911.\n \n America sees Al Qaeda is in Afghanistan mostly.\n \n America says to Taliban, Hand em over (deal with this nusance).\n \n Taliban refuses (repeatedly)\n \n America kicks the #### out of them (in general).\n \n \n \n Replace Al Qaeda with Hezbollah.\n \n Replace America with Israel.\n \n \n How many years does one have to deal with a deadly nusance? Hezbollah and Hamas don't desire to have Israel exist. Their backers (Iran and Syria) don't either. Iran continues to make outlandish comments on Israel on a continual basis and seeks to develope nuclear weapons. They supply Hezbollah with weaponry. There is the belief that some day a 'rogue' nation will supply terrorists with something more potant.\n \n As for withstraining response...please. That has NEVER worked. Just basic human psychology. Would you fight someone like Mike Tyson without restraint or would you really think that he shouldn't hit you back any harder than you hit him? If you were Tyson, would you take the numberous and incesant pin XXXXX attacks or would you just get fed up and smack the attacker down?\n It's not JUST 2 soldiers. It's attacks here, attacks there, threats. You live in uncertainty, you go way out of your way to try to foster peace even upsetting your own citizens by removing illegal settlements and withdrawing from Gaza and you get you hand bit when the Palestinains elect Hamas terrorists to lead them and see how you feel. \n All I see is ghetto mentality.\n \n As for oil prices going up...that has nothing to do with the Mideast crisis.\n It's speculators and demand. Speculators think that there will be a disruption in supply and up the price...even though neither of these two proiduce oil...and never mind that other than Nigeria, oil supplies haven't been excessively disrupted. Demand as in China and India are economically expanding and Americans are still driving cars like crazy and you have a free market edging the prices up.\n That said, expect to see higher prices.\n \n Bush hasn't anything to do with it...other than going after Al Qaeda in Afghanistan (set the standard for how to respond) and from what I gather, the majority of the world was behind this action.\n But, if you need a handy scape goat, blame him. Although in truth, blaming his Illuminati overlords would be better and more effective.\n Sure beats blaming me for profiteering on the 'oil crisis' by speculating in that commodity. I mean, as an American...erm Capitalist Pig, do I really have a choice? \n \n \n As for control...America has about as much 'absolute control' over Israel as Iran or Syria has over Hezbollah or Hamas. Why not blame them?\n Ever heard of free will? Even if you have influence, doen't mean that you have absolute control nor always get what you desire.\n Heck, my wife was recently a member of a mind control cult. Used every trick in the book on her. We wasted the last year and close to 20,000 dollars in divorce proceedings spurred by them. In the end, she was able to see that they were a cult and break away.\n I can attest that a cult has far more control that what you're seeing in politics.",
