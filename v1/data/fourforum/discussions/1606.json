   "This is the thread for DSAdevil and debate girl to debate:\n \n Resolved: \"The words 'under God' ought to be removed from the pledge of allegiance.\" \n \n DSAdevil is the affirmative and will post first and last. The current standard format is 9 posts. 5 for the affirmative and 4 for the negative. If this is acceptable, then you may begin. Once the First Affirmative post has been made I will establish a schedule of one post every week. If this is acceptable, you may begin. If not, please sort it out here and then begin. Establish the first post as \"First affirmative Post.\" This will assist me in following. \n \n Good luck to the both of you.",
