Even ch.17 has internal problems, when read through the eyes of a modern scholar. I picked up on this when reading through Ralph Klein's commentary on I Samuel. Klein claims that there's a contradiction even in ch.17, because Saul calls for David earlier in the chapter as if he knows who he is but then doesn't seem to know who David is later on when rewarding him. Klein's conclusion is that even ch.17 is spliced together from different sources. This made me look again at both pieces of evidence. Nowhere in the chapter does it say that Saul didn't know David. All it says is that he wanted to know whose son he was. He was told whose son he was at the end of ch.16, but it's much more plausible that Saul would forget whose son he was than that he'd forget who David himself was. So it's not clear at all at the end of ch.17 that Saul doesn't know David. Thus is solved the internal problem of ch.17.\n \n But what's really interesting is Klein's claim that Saul does seem to know David earlier in the chapter. The text doesn't come out and say this, but Saul simply hears that David had said some things and sent for him. The only thing the text reports of their conversation is David's defense of why he thinks he can be a good warrior against Goliath. We get none of the questioning of who his father is that we get both earlier at the end of ch.16 and later at the end of ch.17. Should we assume that Saul already knew who David was? We can't assume that for sure, but we have no reason to rule it out\"\n \n What you must realize is that you aren't going to find a \"problem\" like this in scripture that Biblical apologists don't already know about and haven't already defended.

Please consider the following two verses...\n \n 2sa 21:19 And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver`s beam. - JPS Tanakh\n \n 2sa 21:19 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. - KJV\n \n The KJV (Of which I have two - Zondervan Pub. & Thomas Nelson Pub.) show the words \"the brother of\" in italics. Those words do not appear in the Tanakh version. Why? The authors of the KJV often added words or phrases into the text in order to better \"explain\" a particular verse. Those additions can be identified because they are in italics.\n\n \n That's interesting. I have an NIV and it renders the verse as \"Goliath the Gittite,\" I've bumped heads with \"KJV only\" believers (you know, the ones who think the KJV is the only reliable translation) and I have always contended that newer translations tend to be more accurate.",

Not for any reason will I ever condone the smashing of babies heads aginst walls... even if I go to the pit. I couldn't live with my self.\n \n \n\n Do you resign yourself to the pit for eternity rather than have eternal peace and joy in heaven? That doesn't sound very smart either. Looks like you're stuck. You're in a very serious situation and you want to play \"I don't like this or that so I'm going to pretend it's not real.\" Next thing you know you wake up on the other side and see that God's wisdom about destroying evil was legitimate and you're stuck with an eternity of grief.\n\n \n And so now we are back to what I can expectwhen I get to hell huh ??\n \n You aren't intrested in debate... you are a wanna be preacher.",

Your eternal fate depends on you making a legitimate and unbiased examination of the evidence.\n\n \n I read through the site you linked and, while I skimmed through some sections, it seems that Mr Greenleaf takes portions of the new testament and uses them to justify other portions. For example:\n \n \"it is worthy of remark, that of all the investigations and discoveries of travelers and men of letters, since the overthrow of the Roman empire, not a vestige of antiquity has been found, impeaching, in the slightest degree, the credibility of the sacred writers; but, on the contrary, every result has tended to confirm it.\"\n \n This, and other comments and arguments which support it, are hardly conclusive evidence. I concede that there was almost definately a man named Jesus, who was crucified, and that the apostles almost certainly existed as well.\n \n However, without extremely compelling evidence, I cannot believe Jesus was the son of God. It's much more likely he was a charismatic person who believed he had been touched by god. More likely that, even inadvertantly, he decieved the apostles into believing he was the son of God.\n \n Thus, the gospels of the apostles were, to them, the truth.

   "I'm constantly amazed at the at-all-costs determination of at least some Christian fundamentalists to defend that which cannot be defended. Scholarship, according to at least some of these folks, translates to \"Bible-bashing\" by \"pointy-headed, liberal apostates\" or \"God-haters\", or those under the influence of Satan. Throw in a healthy dose of diversion, evasion, and personal attack, and you get the idea. In my humble opinion, such tactics evidence a rear-guard, defensive posture driven by desperation.\n\n \n \nDude, it's been defended, many times, successfully.\n\n \n Really? \n [*]A universe with an age of six thousand years?[*]God creating woman from the rib of the first man?[*]God creating spiders, snakes, sharks, and tigers as herbivores? Snakes stalking berries?[*]An as-yet-undefined law of the universe which prohibits the emergence of new species, or biblical 'kinds'?[*]A talking snake?[*]An extremely improbable global flood?[*]A confused and improbable Exodus story? [*]An improbable conquest of Canaan story? [*]Moses' authorship of the Torah? [*]The sun and moon standing still for an entire day?[*]The earth as stationary and immovable? Resting upon pillars? [*]That Ezekiel's prophecy against Tyre was fulfilled?[*]A fossil record created by Satan in an attempt to lure mankind away from the trooth of the Bible?[*]The ToE as \"Satan's lie\"?[*]Demonic possession as detailed in the NT?[*]Magic tricks attributed to Jesus?[*]The idea put forth in the NT that Jesus' followers can drink poison without fear of harm?[*]The idea put forth in the NT that Jesus' return was imminent? [*]The idea that there is any credibility to be found in the descriptions given in the Book of Revelation? \n Not to mention biblical contradictions, many of which have been addressed by myself and others here.\n \n \nYou're just determined to only see one side of it.\n\n \n Don't underestimate me or attempt to second-guess my objectives. \n \n \nIt's the height of arrogance to think that your view is the only possible correct one.\n\n \n Did I ever make such an assertion? No, I don't think so. In contrast, your 'Brother in Christ' EZ has informed me that I've wasted 20 years of scholarship because I \"lack the truth\" of \"God's Word\" as put forth in the KJV. \n \n \nIf it were mere scholarship and not bias that makes you do what you all do, you wouldn't spent 99.999 percent of your efforts on the Bible (often specifically things about the historical Jesus) and would be much more egalitarian in the religious texts you try to pick apart.\n\n \n Wanna discuss Hinduism? Did you know that Hinduism recognizes a Trinity? Bone up on the subject, and I'll be happy to discuss it with you. Perhaps we can get others to join in. However, I'm not about to tutor you on that or any other religious belief. \n \n I don't attempt to 'pick apart' the Bible. But I believe that the Bible, as with other religious texts, should be subject to scrutiny. Would that some of my Christian fundamentalist friends would embrace that very position, instead of attempting to defend, by any means necessary, every last contradiction and absurdity contained within the Bible, instead of recognizing it for what it is, based upon the evidence.",

Most are cases of you simply interpreting based on the fact that you don't believe miracles are possible. That's not something I or anyone else needs to defend--that's simply a matter of differing opinion. What you are doing is taking all these issues and only portraying them from the extreme fundie POV, which most people don't hold to.

I don't think you'd purposefully make great effort to discredit other things in peoples' lives that they hold very sacred and dear, so why make such an effort with the Bible? Would you be as eager to barge right in and start digging up public land that native Americans find to be sacred burial grounds just for the purpose of saying \"SEE?? There's nothing spiritual here!!\" Why not? It's the same sort of thing. The problem is that people like you often don't make any effort to keep in mind that this isn't just about a collection of old writings--it's about something a lot people hold VERY sacred and dear. We're talking about peoples' feelings here. And there's just a lot more effort put forth by you guys to discredit the Bible than those \"other religious texts\", by orders of magnitude.

   "See, that's the other major issue I have with religion-- it's a huge cop-out. \"I relinquish control of my life to god.\" It's a weak stance to take. It seems to show that you're too weak to take control of your life. You let god do it for you; you're too afraid of being alone, of being by yourself, of having to get through things on your own, but when there's some all loving (But not really) father figure watching down over you, you're consoled by this imaginary presence. People always use the \"God helped me through a difficult time in my life,\" example to prove he exists. Great. I'm glad that you found SOME way through your troubles, but it's one of those things where it's too good to be true. You're having all this trouble when, all of a sudden, you've found the PERFECT way out! All your troubles are solved instantly, you're promised a place in heaven, life everlasting, bla bla bla... It's all so fabricated. It appeals directly to humanity's greatest fears. It's coddling when one should just grow up and face down the challenges life gives out.\n\n First off, sir I take great offense to your assertion that God is a cop-out and that I'm a wimp? No,sir you are dead wrong! God does indeed want us to be able to think. But there is a difference in whether we believe the truth or want to live in a lie. And quite frankly, I'd rather live in the truth!! You're the one who refuses to relinquish the reigns of your life.",

Why should I \"Relinquish the reigns of my life\"? And give those proverbial reigns to your god? I daresay not! I control my actions, and I have no need for some imaginary figure in the sky to coddle me when I scrape my knee. It is a cop out. You are tired from struggling through life, so you give the reigns over to your god, and then it's all \"Ask and thee shall receive.\" It's all rainbows and smiley faces from there, isn't it? Well that's not how life is. Life can be like that, but it rarely stays that way. Humans are afraid of their own mortality.---< They create the concept of heaven and everlasting life, a reward, if you will, for those who suffered through their lives. They dislike other people---< they create a heaven that's more selective than a nightclub in hollywood on a saturday night, therefore preventing said people's entry. They want to be watched over all the time ---< they make up an omnipotent entity that is forever their protector. It covers all of those primal fear bases, and gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside as well. Who wouldn't fall for it?",
