What if the 2 people just want to get married and don't care about producing and somewhere down the road want to adopt? what happens then?\n \n 2. What if they don't want to have a chilD within the first year. most average parents want to have some time alone before they bring the noise and the smells into the house that come with the baby.. Give them at least 3 years\n \n 3. What happens if they just drift away.. and they feel like they don't love each other anymore.. the parents can pay for the child.. the don't have to stay together.. it should be there decision anyways.\n \n 4. why should the license be surrendered. what if they want to adopt a child or have another one?? do we go back to step one??\n \n 5. i can understand that. but many people wont get licenses and just go ahead and produce children..\n \n 6. umm ok.. thats a gimme\n \n 7. surrender the children!!! youre crazy!! what parent in their right mind would willingly give up their child!!!",
