   "1 John 2:22\n New International Version (NIV)\n 22 Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist-denying the Father and the Son.\n What you spiritually dead atheists fail to appreciate is that when it comes to the absolute eternal truths of our Creator God, your denials of Him are nothing more than self deceptions and in fact LIES that deprive Him of the glory and honor He rightfully deserves as the perfect and holy God of all of time and space. \n \n In other words, when you stand before Him, and you most assuredly will one day, you will finally realize how useless it was to deny that He existed while in this mortal flesh. You will realize that your denials meant nothing in changing the reality of who our God is. All they mean is that you preferred death and spiritual darkness to life and the light of Gods eternal truths which we believers partake in. And you will ache with grief that you wasted your life fighting Him and condemning the very Father who created you IN LOVE FOR FELLOWSHIP.\n\n \n Gee! then, there are billions of liars in this world: Muslims, Buddhists, Jews, Hindus and last but not least atheists, all of them liars, only Archie and his brethen speak the truth. The Lord loves liars hence he creates millions of them daily\n Hallelujah emoticon_rolleyes",

   "The belief that there was nothing and then out of nothing magically something called God happened creating everything, except the dinosaurs. And then magically for no reason God divided itself into three distinct persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. All distinct entities but only one God. Figure that out, kinda of multipersonalities disorder, but a Godly kind of disorder.\n And then years later, God impregnated a virgin (\"OH! My God .. OH My God ...\" \"Yes, that's me\" said God) and the ex-virgin gave birth to the Son of God, which is also God, and then the Son of God was killed but later he came back to life (hence he is called a zombie by many) and then, he like a human space ship blasted off into the sky, I mean heaven.\n \n Makes perfect sense.",

   "It is only the truly ignorant who believes that to parrot another post is a valid debate tactic\n\n As opposed to parroting a book, my 'parroting' was an original creation. I was not debating I was illustrating the absurdity of taking a quote presuming it was magically true; asserting that anyone who denies it is a liar.\n \n You must realize that one of the most common strawman that exist is equating being against religion is being against God. Trust me, no one who criticizes faith thinks they are criticizing a divine entity by definition, they are criticizing an ancient book written by people.\n \n So why is your quote a 'valid debate tactic' but not mine?\n \n \nespecially when the reinterpreted parroting is as dishonest as yours is.\n\n Dishonest? How?\n \n \nIn addition to that, you are committing blasphemy by rewriting a verse in the bible to make a fallacious point. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Yea, sometimes if I am 'dishonest' enough people mistake me for a christian and then I get heresy; but most of the time it's the same old boring blasphemy.\n \n \nHere's a question no atheists have ever had the intelligence to consider:\n\n There are no question marks in that image.",
