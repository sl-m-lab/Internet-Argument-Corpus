   "So what arguments did the columnist give to support this claim?\n\n \n He was countering the popular claim that Lawrence will turn out to be the gay rights equivalent of Brown v. Board of Education. In Brown, the Court ruled against segregation in education by the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, saying that \"separate but equal is inherently unequal.\" Or something like that.\n \n Lawrence was justified by the right to privacy, though, instead of the equal protection clause. This guy seems to think that's a bad thing for gay rights, because the Court avoided officially granting homosexuals equal protection. And when you look at civil unions, they're specificially created to be different from marriages. Even civil unions with all the same legal benefits of marriage (which don't exist yet) are still different -- they're designed to be a new category separated from marriage.\n \n Who knows, maybe it is just in the naming convention.. Maybe to most people, \"marriage\" is by definition between a man and a woman, much in the same way \"intercourse\" is by definition the insertion of a penis into a vagina -- in other words, there could be no discriminatory motive behind calling them \"civil unions\". But since they still don't have the same benefits as marriage, there's a pretty good reason to be skeptical about that.",

   "The columnist misunderstood most of the issues. First of all, Lawrence was justified by both due process and equal protection. In her concurrence, Sandra Day O'Connor refused to find a due process violation, but agreed with the result on equal protection grounds; and her opinion was narrower than the Court's main opinion. The majority opinion didn't use equal protection arguments because it didn't need to: they held the statute would be unconstitutional even if it affected everybody equally. This is a stronger holding and in no way weakens the equal protection argument.\n \n The one thing the opinion does not do is put sexual orientation on the same footing as race or creed, which would mean that any law that affects people of different sexual orientations unequally would be subject to the so-called \"strict scrutiny\" in determining whether it is constitutional. But relying on equal protection would not have achieved that effect, either, because the Texas law could not pass the much easier \"rational basis\" test. Anyway, a previous case (Romer v. Colorado(?), 1996) was decided on equal protection grounds without making homosexuals specially protected - for that same reason.\n \n But this doesn't mean that homosexuals are not entitled to equal protection. Equal protection is an individual right, and every citizen is entitled to it. The Court cannot grant that right to anyone; everyone already has it.\n \n Even weaker is the argument about civil unions: within the state that grants them, they are no different than marriages. The difference is currently only that some (i.e. most) states do not grant or recognize them. But that does not make them \"unequal\" or \"separate\" in any way in the jurisdiction that grants them.\n \n In conclusion, there is no similarity between Lawrence and the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. The latter intentionally ignored real differences in opportunities directly caused by separation. There is no such implication in Lawrence.",

This is a stronger holding and in no way weakens the equal protection argument.\n\n \n I may be misunderstanding your argument, but I think this is exactly why the columnist made the point he did. The Court's use of the right to privacy resulted in a stronger holding only in that it made more broad, sweeping changes than it would have if they had argued equal protection. Because they decided the sodomy law violated right to privacy, sodomy laws in effect became obsolete for everyone -- straight or gay -- so the laws in 13 states were overturned. Had they just decided based on equal protection, than possibly only 4 states' laws would have changed -- those that made sodomy illegal only for homosexuals. And those states could very well have decided to keep their sodomy laws, but apply them to everyone instead of just homosexuals. \n \n However, it's not a stronger holding in the way I think you're suggesting, in regard to equal protection. I'll have to read it again, but I'm pretty sure the majority opinion avoids equal protection, which would mean that the sodomy laws aren't unconstitutional because they only target one group, they're unconstituional because they let the government get a little too intrusive. Theoretically, homosexuals could still be second-class citizens under this ruling and could easily be discriminated in plenty of other ways. Had they ruled via equal protection, legal discrimination in other areas would've been much harder to justify. Such as marriage, adoption, etc. This ruling only eliminated sexual discrimination because it made it impossible, not because it determined it was unconstitutional. Basically, instead of determining a solution to the problem, they eliminated the source of the problem altogether. Kind of like shooting a dog for barking too much instead of training it -- only \"solves\" the problem because it gets rid of the source.\n \n \n \n\n But this doesn't mean that homosexuals are not entitled to equal protection. Equal protection is an individual right, and every citizen is entitled to it. The Court cannot grant that right to anyone; everyone already has it.\n\n \n True, but that's the job of the Supreme Court -- to make sure everyone's existing rights are actually protected. The Court didn't grant equal protection in Brown, they just forced state legislators to recognize those already-existing rights of blacks. There are plenty of rights that everyone already has that are subsequently ignored by federal/state/local laws. Those laws are then challenged, and the Supreme Court, idealistically, strikes them down.\n \n \n \n\n Even weaker is the argument about civil unions: within the state that grants them, they are no different than marriages. The difference is currently only that some (i.e. most) states do not grant or recognize them. But that does not make them \"unequal\" or \"separate\" in any way in the jurisdiction that grants them.\n\n \n Really? I thought there was some difference between Vermont's civil unions and the new law in the Netherlands.. I was under the impression the Dutch had made the legal definition completely identical to that of marriage's, while Vermont's was just similar. Something about taxes, maybe? I'll look it up.\n \n Either way, though, they are still not called marriages. This really might be insignificant; it's hard to tell. But that at least implies that civil unions are not considered to be the same as marriages. They're instead the \"best alternative.\" This goes back to what I said earlier, about exactly what the motives are behind the different names (whether mere definition or something inherently discriminatory). But intent is extremely hard to prove, and that's where this argument kind of falls apart. It's purely speculative. Doesn't mean it's wrong, but it doesn't at all mean it's true either.",

And those states could very well have decided to keep their sodomy laws, but apply them to everyone instead of just homosexuals. \n\n \n This is only a speculation and, in the opinion of almost all liberal and moderate constitutional scholars (which opinion I share), such a decision would be wrong. Facially neutral anti-sodomy laws are also discriminatory. Such a decision would make no difference in any practical sense.\n \n \nI'll have to read it again, but I'm pretty sure the majority opinion avoids equal protection, which would mean that the sodomy laws aren't unconstitutional because they only target one group, they're unconstituional because they let the government get a little too intrusive. \n\n \n The majority does not avoid an issue if it simply does not need to consider it. Courts are only supposed to consider issues relevant for the case. If a law is unconstitutional when applied to all, it then follows it is unconstitutional when applied to one group only; the converse does not hold. Once the Court found that anti-sodomy law cannot be constitutional at all (an extraordinary decision, as it overruled the Court's precedent which was only 17 years old), it had no business contemplating how far the constitutional protection of homosexuals as a group goes.\n \n But Justice O'Connor, having chosen not to join in overruling Bowers, found no due process violation, but did join the result on equal protection grounds. This, coupled with the majority's reasoning, clearly sets a precedent that equal protection applies in this case. (But there already is an equal protection precedent concerning homosexuals - the Roemer decision.)\n \n \nTheoretically, homosexuals could still be second-class citizens under this ruling and could easily be discriminated in plenty of other ways. Had they ruled via equal protection, legal discrimination in other areas would've been much harder to justify. Such as marriage, adoption, etc.\n \n \n Theoretically, no one can be a \"second-class citizen\". Period. But you must also understand that there is no right under the US Constitution that is absolute - that cannot be taken away with due process. Not every instance of discrimination is unconstitutional, nor does it imply that someone is a \"second-class citizen\".\n \n There is no way this case could have provided an authoritative ruling on issues like gay marriage or adoption, regardless of what Scalia babbles in his parade of horrors.\n \n \nThis ruling only eliminated sexual discrimination because it made it impossible, not because it determined it was unconstitutional. Basically, instead of determining a solution to the problem, they eliminated the source of the problem altogether. Kind of like shooting a dog for barking too much instead of training it -- only \"solves\" the problem because it gets rid of the source.\n\n \n Think of what you are implying: that it would be better for homosexuals if everyone's rights were violated. Would you solve the problem of unequal access to legal counsel in capital cases by mandating that every defendant must have a court-appointed, underpaid attorney who cannot keep awake during the trial, and may not hire any other help?\n \n \nTrue, but that's the job of the Supreme Court -- to make sure everyone's existing rights are actually protected. \n\n \n Yes, but the paramount duty of all courts is to act only reactively, never proactively. In other words, their decision must be limited to the circumstances of the case before the court.\n \n \nReally? I thought there was some difference between Vermont's civil unions and the new law in the Netherlands..

   "I see your point on the lack of a need to rule with equal protection, given the Court decided sodomy laws were unconstitutional regardless.\n \n I'm not trying to argue that that's how they should've ruled, though. Personally, I think the direction they went brought about more definate changes to the states' laws. Even though the elimination of all sodomy laws theoretically would logically follow from an equal protection ruling, the handling of those laws in the nine remainder states could easily be deferred to future, more specific rulings. Most likely, if the Court had ruled with equal protection, they'd have just mandated that it was unconstitutional for states to criminalize one group, and stopped there.\n \n What I am trying to argue is that if the Court hadn't had a probem with anti-sodomy laws in general, then they'd have a chance to dispose of discrimination altogether.\n \n Here: \n \n \n \n\n But Justice O'Connor, having chosen not to join in overruling Bowers, found no due process violation, but did join the result on equal protection grounds.

Those are simply her reasons for voting the way she did, and any discriminatory law down the line could easily be defending by pointing out that equal protection was not established in this case by a majority.\n \n Romer was limited mostly to political processes.

Theoretically, blacks weren't second-class citizens after the 14th and 15th Amendments were passed. And yes, any right can be taken away, but I fail to see how banning gay marriages could be consitutional, nor how it is an acceptable example of due process.\n \n \n \n\n There is no way this case could have provided an authoritative ruling on issues like gay marriage or adoption, regardless of what Scalia babbles in his parade of horrors.\n\n \n Agreed, with the case decided as it was.

In other words, their decision must be limited to the circumstances of the case before the court.\n\n \n If the circumstances of the case involve discrimination, then an all-encompassing equal protection ruling would be legitimate.

Of course the law there is irrelevent, but I'm saying Vermont has not made the two types of marriage identical. This is why the Netherlands law has been in the news so much and why they were called the \"first\" political body to establish gay marriage, even though Vermont's civil unions law is older. I understand differing state laws; I'm not talking about jurisdiction. I'm looking at Vermont's law in isolation. It's been criticized exactly because their civil unions are not identical to their marriages. They're quite close, but different. That's really the whole basis of the separate but equal argument.",

   "Steeeeve asked if I wanted to continue a discussion on the court case of Lawrence v Texas, and thus I am resurrecting the message board thread that addressed the subject.\n \n Steeeeve, if you want to lay out your arguments for why you think it was improperly ruled upon, then do so.\n \n Until then, a brief background....\n \n \"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court Thursday struck down a Texas state law banning private consensual sex between adults of the same sex in a decision gay rights groups hailed as historic. \n \n The 6-3 decision by the court reverses course from a ruling 17 years ago that states could punish homosexuals for what such laws historically called deviant sex. \n \n Legal analysts said the ruling enshrines for the first time a broad constitutional right to sexual privacy, and its impact would reach beyond Texas and 12 other states with similar sodomy laws applied against the gay and lesbian community, and into mainstream America. \n \n \"The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives,\" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court's majority. \"The state cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.\" \n \n As recently as 1960, every state had an anti-sodomy law, according to The Associated Press. In 37 states, the statutes have been repealed by lawmakers or blocked by state courts, the AP reported. \n \n Of the 13 states with sodomy laws, four -- Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri -- prohibit oral and anal sex between same-sex couples. The other nine ban consensual sodomy for everyone: Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia. \n \n Thursday's ruling apparently invalidates those laws, as well. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the decision appeared to strike down most laws governing private sexual conduct, but he said laws governing marriage would be unaffected. (Full story) \n \n Laws that might be most vulnerable would be ones that govern fornication and adultery, said Diana Hassel, associate professor of law at Roger Williams University. \n \n And while Hassel said \"only a handful\" of states remain still have such laws, Thursday's Supreme Court ruling establishes a benchmark in privacy that had not existed. \n \n Hassel said the ruling, based on due process arguments rather than equal protection laws, would push out new areas in privacy. \"This is going to carve out protection for private sexual behavior,\" Hassel said. \"As long as it's between consenting adults, this ruling would appear to cover it.\" \n \n Case stemmed from mistaken arrest\n Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer agreed in full with Kennedy's opinion. \n \n Justice Sandra Day O'Connor agreed with the final outcome of the case, but did not join the court in reversing the high court's 1986 decision in the similar Georgia case Bowers v. Hardwick. \n \n Religious conservatives quickly criticized the decision, and in a sharply worded dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the court \"has taken sides in the culture war.\" Scalia -- joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas -- said the court \"has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda.\" (The dissent) \n \n \"Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda though normal democratic means,\" Scalia wrote. \n \n This is going to carve out protection for private sexual behavior. \n -- Diana Hassel, law professor \n \n \n But with Thursday's decision, he wrote, the court was \"departing from its role in assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed.\" \n \n Thursday's ruling stemmed from the 1998 arrest of two Houston men, John Geddes Lawrence and Tyron Garner, under a 28-year-old Texas law making same-sex intercourse a crime. The court found that law and others like it violated the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. \n \n \"This is giant leap forward to a day where we are no longer branded as criminals and where that is no longer accepted by the most powerful court in the country,\" said Ruth Harlow, of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, who represented the two men. \n \n Lawrence told reporters Thursday that he and Garner were happy with the outcome, but \"never chose to be public figures or to take on this fight.\" \n \n \"Not only does this ruling let us get on with our lives, but it opens the door for gay people all over the country to be treated equally,\" he said. \n \n Court reversed 1986 ruling\n The Supreme Court was widely criticized 17 years ago when it upheld an anti-sodomy law similar to the Texas law in Bowers v. Hardwick. The ruling became a rallying point for gay activists. Justice Kennedy concluded that decision \"was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today,\" Kennedy wrote. \n \n Harlow said striking down the Bowers decision could lead to other decisions favorable to gays in family law and employment discrimination cases. \"\n http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/06/26/scotus.sodomy/index.html",

   "70% of Americans Favor Overturning Texas Sodomy Law \n 365Gay.com, May 6, 2003\n \n By Paul Johnson, Washington Bureau Chief\n \n Washington, D.C.-A new poll shows the majority of Americans believe the government does not belong in the bedrooms of gays and lesbians.\n \n Seventy-four percent of American adults said the U.S. Supreme Court should overturn state laws that criminalize private, consenting sexual relations between same-sex couples.\n \n The survey, released today, was conducted by Harris Interactive for Witeck-Combs Communications\n \n The Harris poll also reveals that nearly nine out of 10 Americans (87%) oppose state laws regulating private, sexual relations that are applied to opposite-sex married adult couples and almost as many (82%) oppose such laws that are applied to same-sex adult couples in a domestic partnership.\n \n \"Even when we exclude respondents who self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, support for overturning state sodomy laws does not change significantly,\" said Darin Johnson, vice president at Witeck-Combs Communications.\n \n \"It is clear that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe the Supreme Court should overturn all state laws that interfere with private sexual relations between consenting adults, whether same-sex or opposite-sex couples.\"\n \n The nationwide survey questioned more than 2,000 adults, of whom approximately seven percent self-identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender (GLBT). The survey was conducted online between April 17 and 23, 2003 by Harris Interactive but prior to the prominent media attention given to Senator Rick Santorum's (R-PA) interview last month with the Associated Press in which he compared homosexuality with incest, polygamy and adultery. (story)\n \n \"These numbers tell the same story we've been telling courts in this country for years: the vast majority of Americans support the right to privacy of all people, including gays and lesbians, and oppose anti-gay discrimination,\" said Kevin Cathcart, executive director of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the national gay rights organization bringing the Supreme Court challenge to consensual sex laws.\n \n The survey also found that \"75% of self-described Republicans oppose state laws that regulate sexual relations that occur in the private home of an adult same-sex couple in a domestic partnership (as do 88% of self-labeled Democrats). In addition, seven out of 10 Americans (70%) who characterize their personal ideology as \"conservative\" also oppose such laws.\n \n On March 26, 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments testing the Texas same-sex sodomy statute. This case, Lawrence v. Texas, will examine the constitutionality of Texas law (and other similar state laws) that imposes criminal charges on same-sex couples who have consenting sexual relations in the privacy of their home.\n http://www.sodomylaws.org/lawrence/lwnews175.htm",

   "And as a final note, I think it should be pointed out PRECISELY HOW these laws applied to HETEROSEXUALS as well.\n \n First, let's look at the definition of sodomy...\n \n (Merriam-Webster)\n sodomy: anal or oral copulation with a member of the same or opposite sex; also : copulation with an animal \n \n Just to make sure people realize, sodomy includes HETEROSEXUAL ORAL SEX. That is part of the meaning of the word.\n \n Now for the stats on the states:\n 13 states had their sodomy laws stricken down.\n 9 of these states had sodomy laws against BOTH heterosexual and homosexual sodomy. (4 were only against homosexual sodomy)\n 8 of those 9 states' laws stated that it was illegal for a wife to give her husband oral sex.\n \n THAT is the type of archaic lunacy that the sodomy law advocates were fighting for.\n \n So hopefully if somebody wants to argue the issue, they'll explain their stance on making heterosexual sodomy illegal as well, or if it's only the homosexual sodomy they are against...",

There is no mandate that they have to follow a flawed ruling.\n This isn't the first time this has happened either.\n \"In one of the most legendary examples, the Supreme Court reversed its stance on the matter of racial segregation. In the 1896 case Plessy v. Ferguson, the Court ruled that \"separate but equal\" laws were acceptable for blacks and whites. This decision essentially gave Jim Crow laws the full backing of the Court. \n \n But times changed, social norms shifted, and by 1954 the Supreme Court took a very different view of civil rights. That year, in deciding the case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, the justices unanimously rejected the doctrine of \"separate but equal.\" And with that, they quashed the Plessy v. Ferguson verdict.\"\n http://ask.yahoo.com/20060731.html\n Should SCOTUS have stuck with their original ruling declaring segregation to be legal?\n \n 2) And Bowers WAS NOT the exact same case.\n You make it clear TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT YOU HAVE NOT READ this case.\n Bowers involved a state which outlawed BOTH heterosexual AND homosexual sodomy.\n Texas ONLY outlawed homosexual sodomy.\n The court was being asked to look at the case from multiple fronts, and one of the main ones that anybody should have been able to predict would fail for Texas was that Texas WAS VIOLATING EQUAL PROTECTION in allowing legal sodomy for heterosexuals but having it illegal for homosexuals.\n The fact that you missed this GLARING difference demonstrates quite clearly you HAVE NOT READ the case.\n This fact was the PRIMARY REASON that this case was not rejected solely along the lines of \"see Bowers v Hardwick\".\n \n \n \nSo I guess you could say they through in some cases that don't logically go together (humerous how Casey and Roe were brought up in the case as they decided to go away from that line of logic).\n\n I guess YOU would say that, especially since you have not READ THE THING to begin with.\n READ it and you'll see WHAT PARTS of those cases they were referencing in their thought process on Lawrence v Texas.\n \n \n \nAlright, once again it is clear you are just here to smear me.... this conversation is over.\n\n This conversation never really began Steeeeve.\n You said you had some legal arguments against Lawrence v Texas as to why it was LEGALLY flawed, but then you proceeded to open your yap and make it clear that you HAD NEVER READ the thing to begin with.\n This isn't \"smear\".

I guess that the observation that \"separate but equal\" laws weren't constitution could also be viewed as \"a relatively new legal idea\".\n \n But as far as \"new ideas\" go, every state in the United States had a law against sodomy in 1960. But at the time of Lawrence v Texas, only 13 states had them on the books.\n \n In 1961, Illinois became the first with the \"legal idea\" that sodomy shouldn't be illegal, and they removed it from their books. State after state followed suit over the next 40+ years, with only 13 exceptions. At the time of Lawrence v Texas decision, the idea that sodomy laws should be illegal was a view held by only about 70% of the United States population.\n \n So not only is sodomy being legal not a \"relatively new idea\" (having a history of 40+ years), it's also an idea that has popular support amongst most Americans.\n \n \n \nI don't have much time now to go any deeper, but I welcome any comments on the small point I have made above.\n\n Hopefully that will be food for thought.",

   "SCOTUS stated \"separate but equal\" laws were legal, before they eventually ruled they weren't. I guess that the observation that \"separate but equal\" laws weren't constitution could also be viewed as \"a relatively new legal idea\".\n\n However, if it was a relatively new legal idea, that idea was at least directly inferrable from the 14th Amendment, which was (and still is) widely held to have been addressing issues of race.\n \n \nBut as far as \"new ideas\" go, every state in the United States had a law against sodomy in 1960. But at the time of Lawrence v Texas, only 13 states had them on the books.\n\n Does this mean that sodomy is a Constitutional right?\n \n \nIn 1961, Illinois became the first with the \"legal idea\" that sodomy shouldn't be illegal, and they removed it from their books. State after state followed suit over the next 40+ years, with only 13 exceptions. At the time of Lawrence v Texas decision, the idea that sodomy laws should be illegal was a view held by only about 70% of the United States population.\n\n I think you may have misunderstood my point. I was not trying to say that just because X is a relatively new idea that it is therefore not in the Constitution. I was merely trying to suggest that citing cases that are only ten years old as authority for making X a Constitutional right calls the decision's precedential force into question.\n \n \nSo not only is sodomy being legal not a \"relatively new idea\" (having a history of 40+ years), it's also an idea that has popular support amongst most Americans.\n\n There is a big difference in the claim that \"sodomy is legal\" and the claim that \"sodomy is protected by the Constitution.\" I doubt that most Americans, if asked, believe that sodomy is a right protected by the Constituion.",

Basically, if something can be considered a right, and the Constitution doesn't explicitly allow the government to compromise that right, than they can't.\n Very well stated. The philosophy behind the Constitution is that people should be permitted the freedom to pursue whatever happiness floats their boat... unless there's a rational (i.e., non-faith-based) and compelling reason for the government to prevent it. As Jefferson said (I'm paraphrasing), if doesn't break someone's leg or pick someone's pocket, the government has no reason to butt in. (And offending one's sensitivities or allowing someone's self-described \"moral beliefs\" to be violated by others is NOT an equivalent to having one's leg broken. If it were, the pork industry would have collapsed decades ago.)",

My point is that if the Court was trying to establish that sodomy is a constitutional right protected by the 14th Amendment, their case would be stronger if they were able to show that this was considered as fundamental to those who enacted the Amendment. In my opinion, their case is weakened in that they cannot really cite a precedent prior to the Warren Court decisions.\n \n \nYes.\n There is also a difference inbetween \"sodomy is protected by the Constitution\", and \"sodomy laws are unconstitutional\".

For sodomy to be legal, it was not the case that it had to be enshrined in the Constiution. This is easily seen in the fact that many states had legalized it. However, there were also several who wanted their laws to remain.

Board was.\n\n I disagree.\n The 14th amendment NEVER mentions race, although race was clearly one example of unjust discrimination its purpose was to fight against. Race is also \"not tied to the text\" of the 14th amendment.\n As per \"context\", the context is not a solitary one. It includes race, gender, religion, ... A long list of items.\n Including sexual orientation is not a far stretch.\n \n Moreover, \"segregation\" does not set up an issue of automatic inequality, and thus requires more of a stretch to invoke the 14th amendment. I could create two identical schools and staff them with two identical staffs, and then send all white kids to one school and all black kids to the other. Equality satisfying the \"text\" of the 14th amendment.\n \n But the Texas sodomy case involved INHERENT INEQUALITY. Heterosexual sodomy was legal in the state, while homosexual sodomy was illegal. A clear violation of \"equal protection\" of the 14th amendment.\n \n \n \nIn this case the court used the Due Process clause to essentially say that sodomy is a right which a State may not infringe, but I simply do not see any logical inferrence of a right to sodomy from the 14th Amendment. You said above that you do. I wonder if you could explain why you think this in a little more detail.\n\n No. I did not \"say above that I do\", because I explicitly said that the court ruling clearly established NO RIGHT TO SODOMY.\n \n We'll cover that in next...\n \n \n \nI believe that they actaully did say that sodomy is a constitutional right. Certainly not in those exact words, but it seems to me that the following quote establishes this conclusion:\n \n\n Their [petitioner's] right to liberty under the Due Process Clasue gives them full right to engage in their conduct [sodomy] without intervention of the government. \n\n \n\n I shrunk YOUR PARAPHRASEMENTS of their actual statements to emphasize where you are interjecting YOUR INTERPRETATION into what the court actually said.\n Particularly because I disagree with the latter interjection.\n It wasn't \"sodomy\" conduct that the were talking about. There is a previous statement in the ruling which is more explicit and specific.\n \"Petitioners' right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in private conduct without government intervention.\"\n \n And more concretely, if you look at the CONTEXT OF WHERE YOU TOOK YOUR QUOTE FROM, you'll also see that they were referring to PRIVATE conduct.\n \"The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government.\"\n \n They were focusing on PRIVATE conduct, and NOT sodomy conduct.\n \n And while I typically disagree with many of Scalia's statements in his dissent, I find this one to be fairly accurate.\n \n \"Though there is discussion of \"fundamental proposition[s],\" ante, at 4, and \"fundamental decisions,\" ibid. nowhere does the Court's opinion declare that homosexual sodomy is a \"fundamental right\" under the Due Process Clause; nor does it subject the Texas law to the standard of review that would be appropriate (strict scrutiny) if homosexual sodomy were a \"fundamental right.\" Thus, while overruling the outcome of Bowers, the Court leaves strangely untouched its central legal conclusion: \"[R]espondent would have us announce ... a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy. This we are quite unwilling to do.\"\"\n \n \n \nFor sodomy to be legal, it was not the case that it had to be enshrined in the Constiution. This is easily seen in the fact that many states had legalized it. However, there were also several who wanted their laws to remain. Before Lawerence, the States had the authority over this issue.\n \n Lawerence, it appears to me, did establish that sodomy was a right protected by the constituiton (per the quote I posted above), thus removing an issue that had been, until Lawerence, fully subject to State legislation.\n\n I disagree still on the \"sodomy was a right\" issue.\n It's like an issue of freedom of speech, and SPECIFIC TYPES of free speech.\n I can say \"I hate the president\", and that's an example of free speech.\n But if I tried to stand up and yell at the top of my lungs \"I hate the president\" while sitting at his inauguration, I could expect to be arrested.\n \n Likewise, if I engage in sodomy in the privacy of my own home, that is an example of right to PRIVACY.\n But if I engage in sodomy in public, I have no right to privacy and can expect to be arrested.\n \n The right to free speech and right to privacy exist, but there are areas where society's interests curb those rights. The first example would be disrupting the public. The second would be indecent exposure.\n \n The ACT itself of saying \"I hate the president\" is not protected, but rather it is protected AS A FORM of free speech.\n Likewise, the act of sodomy is not a right, but rather it is protected AS A FORM of right to privacy.\n \n One other thing you should realize about the ruling is that it ALSO DISCUSSED THE RATIONALE for the state's legislating against homosexuality. Namely, \"morality\". The court stated in its ruling that the state using \"morality\" as a sole legitimate state interest was invalid.\n \n Which left us with a violation of right to privacy, with no legitimate state interest in violating the right to privacy. Ergo, right to privacy wins out.\n \n \n \nAlso, please let me know if this would be a correct summary of the way you read Lawerence: \"It's not that sodomy is a right protected by the Constitution, it's that the Constitution prohibits any laws which would prohibit sodomy.\" Is this a fair restatement of your reading?\n\n Yes. That's fair.\n I would elaborate that it \"prohibits any laws\" which would prohibit PRIVATE sodomy involving two consenting partners, and possibly other qualifiers. The court ruling made an explicit listing of some of those qualifiers in their ruling.",
