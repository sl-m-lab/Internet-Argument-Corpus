   "\"In this archaic [Pelasgian] religious system there were, as yet, neither Gods nor priests, only a universal Goddess and her priestesses, woman being the dominant sex and man her frightened victim.

   "That's quite a nice presentation of pantheism. But the original quote could as easily mean 'I am what I am' and communicate reliability, impossibility to understand etc.\nIt literally could be: am am  or are are  or was was  or were were  or will be will be or shall be shall be. HAYAH has no tense, has no gender and has no singular nor plural inherent to it. In Genesis, the term ELOHIYM is translated in the KJV as God. However ELOHIYM is a plural. So a valid rendering of HAYAH HAYAH could well be We are what We are. This is used as the basis for God being both male and female as well as God being a triune God. However in both those cases there is the assumption that we know something we do not know and then we limit our understanding of God to fit that \"knowledge\". God may be simultaneously male and female (which is completely acceptable), but we cannot say that God is solely male and female because we do not know the limits of God (if there are any). There may be three persons in one God (which is completely acceptable) but we cannot say that God is only three persons because we do not know the limits of God (if there are any) and thersfore this could be used as a rationale for polytheism. \n \n So, for me, the attempt to limit the illimitable and define the indefinable in human conceptualizations is a fruitless endeavor that distracts us from the real purpose of all spiritual teachings which is to find peace in our lives. Moses tells a story about God creating the world (Genesis) and uses a personification of God and we become obsessed with the character of God in the story and lose the moral and spiritual message of the story. That is like worshiping Scrooge and forgetting the moral of Dickens' A Christmas Carol. The character of God in Genesis does not exist. There wasn't anybody who walked around pointing his finger and creating horses and flies and oak trees, just like Scrooge never existed and three spirits never appeared in his bedroom and he did not fly backwards in time. But instead of addressing the message we light candles to the character.\n \n You also have to read Exodus 3:13 in the context of all that comes before it (verses 1 through 12). In verse 6 God tells Moses who he is: Moreover he said, I [am] the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.\n \n So it isn't as if Moses didn't know who he was talking to. In Exodus 3:13 Moses asks for God's SHEM. The Hebrew word SHEM is translated in this verse as \"name\". However, a more common meaning of SHEM in the Bible is essence: the essential reality of who someone is, as in Proverbs 21:24. In Biblical Hebrew, to trust in someone's SHEM means to trust him because of who he is. To bless someone's SHEM means to bless him because of who he is. So Moses asks for a name - something that expresses the essential reality of who he is talking to. He gets words that mean \"exist\" without reference to time or place.\n \n So, if one wants to limit the meaning of the words to I AM WHAT I AM - what does that tell you? That's what Popeye says in the cartoons, \"I am what I am and that's all what I am, I'm Popeye the sailor man!\" \n \n Is God limited to present tense? Moses asks for an essential reality. He gets an answer. God doesn't say, \"I will not tell you my essential reality\", he gives Moses an answer. It is the single most important revelation in the Torah. \n \n You cannot understand the teachings of Jesus without understanding the name of God given to Moses. When Jesus refers to \"the God of Abraham and the God of Moses\" that is who he is referring to. Do we really think that a brilliant man like Moses makes up this elaborate wonderful story using the metaphor of God as a burning bush, and then asks God for his name (his essential reality), and God doesn't give him a direct answer, in fact gives him a kind of rebuke - and if you don't interpret it as a rebuke, at minimum he gives him a riddle? I give Moses more credit than that. I think he knew exactly what he was doing when he used the word HAYAH twice in succession.\n \n So I choose to see God as existing outside of time: as having been in the past, as being in the present and as \"will being\" in the future. To limit God to time is to limit the illimitable. Moses gave us the awareness of the essential reality of God. Jesus gave us the meaning -- the manifestation.",

There are cultures with many female figurines that may be fertility symbols (The Indus Valley Civilisation, for instance), but no compelling evidence of an exclusively feminine divine.",

   "A friend and I were arguing the other day if God was a masculine entity, feminine, or just it. He said God was an it without gender. Now I understand that God doesn't have the male reproductive organs, but I also consider him to be of a masculine nature due to the fact that all of scripture refers to him in this manner. My friend however, says he has found a verse in the Bible that supposedly says God is neither male nor female so he believes God to be an it. I think this verse is simply implying God is not a male or female in the understanding as we have of it. I don't know the verse he was referring to, but I think he has simply misunderstood it. \n \n What are your thoughts?\n\n In one sense God has no gender. When we refer to God as \"He\" is is because of the relationship of God to us, in that God is our Father.\n \n Jesus, who is also God, to become fully human took on a gender, and this is as 'the Son'.",

   "Now I could be wrong, but in my opinion and my understanding, the constant amount of male terms in Torah is a fault of the Hebrew Language. As you may or may not know, every noun is either male or female, and every verb has a male or female identifier with it. There is no such thing as a neutral term like \"it\". When a person is in doubt, go male. If there is a group of men and women, then the verbs go male. So when in doubt with HaShem, go male. Now, of course this doesn't mean that HaShem is a male, nor would you find me claiming such, it has more to do with the intrinsics of Hebrew.",

   "I read an interesting article the other day (wish I had the link) talking about this very issue. \n God has been described by the Church (in Tradition and the Bible) as a loving father, and when His Son came to earth, He gave us the prayer, \"Our Father\" and frequently refers to God as His Father (in a personal sense, not the adopted sense that we would use). One might easily tend to anthropomorphize (sp) the Holy Trinity as a family, by describing the Holy Spirit as feminine, but then one comes across another HUGE (insurmountable) problem:\n The Annunciation. The Holy Spirit came upon Mary, and miraculously impregnated the Virgin with Our Lord. It becomes obvious at this point why we cannot describe the Holy Spirit as female. \n \n Catholic tradition (yeah, I'm Catholic) may use both masculine AND feminine words to describe God (would a mother forsake her child?) in certain senses. However, while we are right to refer to God as our Father, God is beyond any definition of sex or gender.",

   "God is a spirit. \n He is the perfection of both man and woman. (however according to the Catholic curch He sholud be reffered to in the maskilin form)\n Often when the bible says man it is including women. \n Technicly, adam is like a gender nutal \"it\" in hebrew. \n In the bible, Gode created humans, and than gave them male and female.\n\n \n This is very true, God is a spirit and therefore cannot be either.\n God is described as having feminine qualities in the bible, but also masculine qualities too. Man (i.e. Man and Woman) were made in God's image. \n \n God has the principal attributes of love, justice, wisdom and power. (1#John 4:8; Deut. 32:4; Job 12:13; Isa. 40:26)\n \n If you've ever wondered what God is like; God is the kind of person we can grow to love if we get to know him well. Some may ask \"how we can get to know him if we cannot see Him (He being a spirit)?\" The Bible shows one way when it says: \"For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world's creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship.\" (Romans 1:20) So the things that God has created can help us to understand what God is like, if we really examine them and think about them. As we have seen, a look at the starry heavens surely tells us of God's greatness and tremendous power! (Psalm 8:3,#4; Isaiah 40:26) \n \n Then consider the earth. God placed it in the heavens so it gets just the right amount of heat and light from the sun. And consider the water cycle. The rain falls to water the earth. The water runs into the rivers, which flow into the seas. The sun lifts the water from the seas as vapor, which falls as rain to water the earth again. (Ecclesiastes 1:7)\n There are so many marvelous cycles that God put into operation to provide food, shelter and all things that man and animals need. This shows God's great wisdom and that he is most generous and cares for his creations.-Proverbs 3:19,#20; Psalm 104:13-15,#24,#25.\n \n Consider your own body. It obviously was made to do more than just live. It was marvelously designed really to enjoy life. (Psalm 139:14) Our eyes can see not just in black and white but in color, and the world is filled with a wealth of colors to enjoy. We can smell and taste. So eating is not merely a necessary function; it can be delightful. Such senses are not absolutely necessary for life, but they are gifts from a loving, generous, thoughtful God.-Genesis 2:9; 1#John 4:8.\n \n A look at God's dealings with humankind also shows what kind of God he is. He has a strong sense of justice. He does not show favoritism to certain races of people. (Acts 10:34,#35) He is also merciful and kind. The Bible says of his dealings with the nation of Israel, whom he delivered from slavery in Egypt: \"He was merciful; .#.#. he kept remembering that they were flesh.\" Yet the Israelites often were disobedient, and that made God sad. As the Bible says: \"They would make him feel hurt .#.#. and they pained even the Holy One of Israel.\" (Psalm 78:38-41; 103:8,#13,#14) On the other hand, when his servants are obedient to his laws, God rejoices. (Proverbs 27:11) Also, God describes how he feels when his servants are made to suffer by enemies: \"He that is touching you is touching my eyeball.\" (Zechariah 2:8) \n \n We should be moved to love a God who has such affection for lowly and insignificant humans.",
