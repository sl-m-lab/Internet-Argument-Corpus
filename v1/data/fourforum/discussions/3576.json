Faith requires no evidence, with faith, one can claim all of mathematics irrational, true, false, or anything they one can dream up. Reason, however, can be used on the foundation of knowledege that begins with basic self-evident claims (I exist, for example), and basic laws of logic, we can extend from there definitions about mathematics, etc. \n \n \nFaith CAN contradict each other but to one person faith is a fact. \n \n Someone's belief of something as being a fact has no bearing on what can be shown, rationally.\n \n \nAnd since math and numbers are abstract ideas invented by humans you are really saying you have faith that our definition of addition will suffice and that we say 2+2=4. \n \n \n No, I most certainly do not have faith. It's reasoned.\n We assign specific meanings to words, and if we agree on the meanings, in that context, they are defined, if they are defined, then we can proceed logically, which we have. If I relied on faith, I would need to agreement, it would just \"be\". Since this is obviously not the case, it's most certainly not faith. \n \n \nYou're right faith can't be relied on as evidence, but to a person it can be just as convincing as fact. \n \n Sure, and it's irrational, and personally, I find it frightening to think that a parent might put a child at risk based on \"faith\", or a president might put an entire country at risk based on \"faith\". Yet this is irrelevant to this discussion.\n \n \nAnd faith can use evidence even if it doesn't require evidence. \n \n Faith cannot \"use\" anything, but I assume you mean a person can use both faith and reason. A person can choose any method they feel like to arrive at a conclusion. However, faith still cannot seperate truth from that which is false, which is the claim in dispute.

No one reasonable can, unless like the proof of god (see unker's thread), we accept god as \"the best of the living things in the universe\". Which doesn't seem to fit the traditional god-view.\n \n I have some sympathy for the latter part of your statement. I don't spend time on the religion forum unless specially called there (last by Montalban). If you notice my quote from the above, it begins with Montalban making false claims, in an argument about evolution, which I think meets your criteria for \"what you have a problem with\". I have a problem with it too.\n \n \nThat's your opinion.\n\n \n No, given the definitions and basic logic, it's true.

Then says that it's self-evident and beyond questioning. 2+2=4, everyone knows that is beyond question, therefore his other statement, which is not related to the maths equation is equally true \n \nDoes nothing to refute my reasoning.

   "No, not your posting, your effort at posting.\n \n Yes, indeed, by refuting as you just now did, your statement about unknowables. :)\n \n Do I?\n \n You started this thread by attempting to do to me, what you now claim I am doing to you. A little insight, and you'd almost be there!\n \n Indeed, and I've gone into detail where you refute yourself. You even do in this thread!\n \n I didn't say truth was accidental. The truth is. You might find it 'accidentally', but even this happens in science, such as when Penicillin was found by Fleming. It was made 'science' by scientists such as the Australian, Florey.\n \n Non-sequitur.\n \n \n In a sense you are correct, how would you ever know the 'truth' of the situation? You'd just pick an arbitrary moment, make a claim, and then continue to make that claim as if you're making an argument. Unless you can show me a science test to prove it.\n \n \n Prove it.\n \n \n See, you just keep saying this, and it becomes ingrained in your psyche.\n \n \n Again you just say it. Why is it irrelevant? Because it 'is'? What fun. For you, your ultimate test for truth (called: 'science') is, not only based just on your belief that it is, but even your notion of science as just being science is based on your belief that it is. When in fact it's a particular philosophy of science.\n \n \n No, it's relevant. I've shown that you can have a truth \"The sun is at the centre of the solar system\"\n You can believe in it through faith alone. You can believe it through science. It is still 'true', regardless whether you have reason to believe it or not. You see, the problem for your debate is you switched from a better argument; that science is good for testing a 'truth' to one that has no basis in reality, that faith can't find truth.\n \n \n What fun, again. No where have I ever said that the unknown can't be made known. I argued about the 'unknowable'. How quickly we forget :)\n \n Good, it wouldn't be the first time you've pretended to argue something we agree on.\n \n \n Please elaborate.\n \n How? And why is this exclusive to all other systems?\n \n \n What is objective about reason?\n \n \n So, you're saying that reason can find a truth, but it's not certain it's true?\n \n \n \n Oh? But that's what you're arguing really, anyway. Since you believe that faith is highly subjective, and can't find a truth, by default science can. And you believe science is objective, no doubt. And this too, no doubt, would be based on your belief that it is, because it is :)\n \n \n What evidence do you have for aliens?

Indeed; the essence and presence of a factor in a given degree cannot be used to predict, linearly, the behavior of a system; bird, atom, molecule, photon, person, species, or society. No longer may we use formal axiomatic theory in conjunction with binary logic with which to model reality, predict and thus control system dynamics. Indeed control itself becomes a casualty of post-modern science.\"\n \n http://www.critcrim.com/redfeather/chaos/001intro.html\n \n \"(Chaos is) the unpredictable evolution of the behavior of many nonlinear dynamical systems. Because of their sensitive dependence on initial conditions, the error in predicting the future states of such systems grows exponentially with time, so that the future states of such systems becomes essentially unknowable in a relatively brief period of time. Although chaos means unpredictability, it should not be understood to mean that the system was not or is not determined (Masterpasqua & Perna, 1997, p. 304).\"\n \n http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2001/BrainsBodiesBifurcations.htm\n \n The Unknown and The Unknowable\n \n \"Another famous negative result, due to the British genius, Alan Turing, states that you cannot tell in advance if a certain abstraction of a digital computer called a Turing machine will ever halt with the correct answer. Now, what all these impossibility results have in common is that they are about the manipulation of symbols, that is, they are about mathematics.\"\n \n http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/traub/traub_p2.html\n \n Some scientists don't shut eyes to the &#8216;unknowable'\n \n \"So what is an example of something unknowable? Take the diet of a given person living in a village in the year 1300. \"You may know on average what his diet was,\" said Jesse Ausubel, the program officer of the Sloan Foundation. \"But you cannot say what he ate on Dec. 15, 1300.\"\n \n http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/nation/98/02/02/unknowability.2-2.html\n \n \n \n APPENDIX B\n \n Where you suggest they might exist...\n \n Post #301 of \"Where does science say we come from\"\n \n \n \"Where\", would mean where the matter that makes us \"comes from\", or in generally, where the universe comes from.

   " We can theorize about it and look at INDIRECT evidence about other dimensions etc., but we cannot know them. \n \n Incorrect. If we have evidence, indirect or otherwise, we can claim knowledge. Don't exclude indirect evidence as evidence, all evidence is \"indirect\", by definition (obtained through sense), it can't be excluded from itself. Faith requires no evidence, not reason.\n \n \n We can theorize and discuss infinity, but we cannot know it. \n \n \n Infinity is tricky, but is generally still consistent either way it's approached.\n I have a short answer and a longer answer, both very plain-english. I'll start with short.\n \n To say \"one cannot know infinity\", needs to be clarified as being:\n - claims of something \"real\" that are infinite\n - claims of the concept of infinite in terms of \"not having an end\".\n \n Conceptually, we can know infinity. Natural numbers (1, 2, 3...)\n If I give you a number, any number, can you tell me if it's in the set of natural numbers? Yes. Will adding 1 to any number..ANY number, result in a larger number, and if this is repeated (recursion) will this end? No.\n \n We do not rely on faith. To rely on faith and claim knowledge of infinity is meaningless, we can't have reasonable discussions BASED on faith, since reason requires evidence, and faith does not. As illustrated below:\n \n I believe based on faith, that infinity has an end.\n I believe based on faith that infinity has no end.\n \n Both of these are true or false, based on no evidence, and are logical absurdities. Faith cannot give us knowledge, by definition, nor can faith let us know the unknowable, or the concept of infinity. The concept of infinity has no meaning without reason, even the concept of faith has no meaning, without reason. It's not the other way around, to suggest it is begs the question, which you should avoid.\n \n Reason requires faith. False.\n Faith requires reason. True.\n \n The foundation of reason: \"I exist\" is an axiom, self-evidence.\n The foundation of faith \"Proof without evidence\"\n \n To even make a claim of a definition of faith, requires acceptance of the foundations of reason..i.e. existence, identify, consciousness, a is a, excluded middle, either a or not a.\n \n Thus, to make meaningfull claims require reason, faith requires reason, without reason, faith has no meaning.\n ===============================================\n \n Another example:\n Take a circle, an infinite loop.\n - Point to the end of the circle.\n \n Now, this is the root of your misapplication of reason being inadequate.\n It's not that you're incapable of pointing to the end of something. You can, given the definition of \"end\". You can use reason and do so. However, the request is illogical to begin with, you aren't inadequate to the task. To ask you to point to the end, of that which has no end, is nonsensical. It's not wonder you'd need faith to do this, faith allows for anything since it requires no evidence. You could then claim a circle has an end, or you don't exist, or any number of nonsensical things. To claim reason is inadequate because it cannot allow one to know something that cannot be known, is fallacy.\n \n We can know.\n Understanding of faith requires reason.\n I exist requires no faith, it's self-evident.\n Logic requires no faith, the axioms are self-evident.\n From these self-evident axioms we can reason.\n \n I find it interesting that so many people turn to faith for \"comfort\", thinking it's a foundation of some sort. But faith gives no comfort if you fully accept reason, it's actually denial of reality. And if I have comfort in anything, it's the knowledge that I exist, and the resulting conclusions that I draw, through reason, from this. For you to deny it, denies security, denies comfort, denies good, denies evil, denies everything.\n \n I have comfort in my knowledge, and it's justified. I find no comfort in the unjustified. How can the unknown or unknowable give a reasonable person \"comfort\" or \"security\"? I dont' know, but I feel a foundation, and certainty, give me more comfort than the lack therof.\n \n -Mach",

   "Why: Let's define the more ambiguous term:\n Understanding: (webster)\n to accept as a fact or truth or regard as plausible without utter certainty  \n To differentiate truth from falsity requires the application of reason (or possibly some other system which you can tell us about). Quite simply, by definition, understanding cannot be achieved without reason, to begin with, a definition of understanding, or the meaning associate with it, would be meaningless without accepting reason. In contrast, to make a claim about something that cannot be known, is a contradiction. That is, knowledge of the unknowable cannot be achieved through reason, the entire statement would be nonsensical.\n \n \n Yes, it can also be measured as both from what I recall. I don't recall claiming otherwise.\n \n\n You did not seem to think about my question. I did not ask you to think about the definition of understanding, I asked you to think about he definition of existence. Think about what that could mean in a broad sense, especially to people other than yourself, and you might start getting the picture.\n Regarding the particle/wave part, Yes you did claim this.

Think about what that could mean in a broad sense, especially to people other than yourself, and you might start getting the picture.\n Regarding the particle/wave part, Yes you did claim this. Read post #50.\n\n \n I typed a long one, then cut it down, I suppose I cut too deep if I didn't address your question emoticon_frazzled \n \n With regards to thinking about existence:\n \n Existence is the self-evident axiom of reason, it's the foundation, not some obscure difficult concept, or infrequently investigated term, it's THE FOUNDATION of reason.\n \n Why:\n You can deny a lot of things, but to deny existence is to deny your ability to deny existence, along with identity and consciousness. As Aristotle points out, to deny it, requires you to open your mouth and form some words, which implies existence anyway, so we're all stuck with our own existence.\n \n So, existence is implied in everything we say, or do, we accept it every time we think. As is your identity, you are this thing that exists, and consciousness. Once you begin to talk, you can accept the axioms of logic as well, then you're set to start making sense, and are able to learn, etc. It's these things that aren't taught early on in school (if ever), but provide the foundation for every single bit of knowledge we ever learn.\n \n So yes, I think about it every time I think, it's implied in every word I type, in every sentence I form, in every breath I take.\n \n I have thought about it, I will think about it, and so will you, knowingly or not. \n \n I have demonstrated my understanding of the word, is that sufficient?\n \n I think we all intuitively accept this, but to see it in words provided me with understanding of what I understand, and allows me to be certain of at least one thing. It's the root of reason, and while I use reason every time I hit the keyboard and expect cause/effect for a letter to appear on a monitor, that also works off reason-based principles, knowing how I know it means a lot to me, it was, for me at least, enlightening.\n ------\n \n Regarding light/particle, you misunderstand.\n \n I'm just referencing : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle\n \n Light may exist as both a wave and a particle, yes, but they cannot be simultanesouly observed as both, accurately, which is what I claimed, based on HUP. When you measure one, the other is always a less precise measurment. It applies to every pair of conjugate variables, not just light waves. This is my understanding, and the best example I found that is pretty mind-blowing (for my simple mind) is:\n \n \n Albert Einstein was not happy with the uncertainty principle, and he challenged Niels Bohr with a famous thought experiment (See the Bohr-Einstein debates for more details): we fill a box with a radioactive material which randomly emits radiation. The box has a shutter, which is opened and immediately thereafter shut by a clock at a precise time, thereby allowing some radiation to escape. So the time is already known with precision. We still want to measure the conjugate variable energy precisely. Einstein proposed doing this by weighing the box before and after. The equivalence between mass and energy from special relativity will allow you to determine precisely how much energy was left in the box. Bohr countered as follows: should energy leave, then the now lighter box will rise slightly on the scale. That changes the position of the clock. Thus the clock deviates from our stationary reference frame, and again by special relativity, its measurement of time will be different from ours, leading to some unavoidable margin of error. In fact, a detailed analysis shows that the imprecision is correctly given by Heisenberg's relation.\n \n Special relativity is, and possibly always will be, spooky to me. Time being constant is such an every day concept, I'm always wow'd when I recall that it's NOT constant, it's relative.\n \n So, to sum up, if someone claims you are not adequate to the task of knowing with accuracy two conjoined variables simultaneously, you do not have to accept their charge of inadequacy. No one has disproved the uncertainty principle, and it clearly shows they CANNOT be known precisely, simultaneously, CANNOT. To suggest someone is not sufficient to address something that cannot be addressed is an exercise in the absurd.\n \n -Mach",

   "Incorrect. If we have evidence, indirect or otherwise, we can claim knowledge. Don't exclude indirect evidence as evidence, all evidence is \"indirect\", by definition (obtained through sense), it can't be excluded from itself. Faith requires no evidence, not reason.\n \n \n \n Infinity is tricky, but is generally still consistent either way it's approached.\n I have a short answer and a longer answer, both very plain-english. I'll start with short.\n \n To say \"one cannot know infinity\", needs to be clarified as being:\n - claims of something \"real\" that are infinite\n - claims of the concept of infinite in terms of \"not having an end\".\n \n Conceptually, we can know infinity. Natural numbers (1, 2, 3...)\n If I give you a number, any number, can you tell me if it's in the set of natural numbers? Yes. Will adding 1 to any number..ANY number, result in a larger number, and if this is repeated (recursion) will this end? No.\n \n We do not rely on faith. To rely on faith and claim knowledge of infinity is meaningless, we can't have reasonable discussions BASED on faith, since reason requires evidence, and faith does not. As illustrated below:\n \n I believe based on faith, that infinity has an end.\n I believe based on faith that infinity has no end.\n \n Both of these are true or false, based on no evidence, and are logical absurdities. Faith cannot give us knowledge, by definition, nor can faith let us know the unknowable, or the concept of infinity. The concept of infinity has no meaning without reason, even the concept of faith has no meaning, without reason. It's not the other way around, to suggest it is begs the question, which you should avoid.\n \n Reason requires faith. False.\n Faith requires reason. True.\n \n The foundation of reason: \"I exist\" is an axiom, self-evidence.\n The foundation of faith \"Proof without evidence\"\n \n To even make a claim of a definition of faith, requires acceptance of the foundations of reason..i.e. existence, identify, consciousness, a is a, excluded middle, either a or not a.\n \n Thus, to make meaningfull claims require reason, faith requires reason, without reason, faith has no meaning.\n ===============================================\n \n Another example:\n Take a circle, an infinite loop.\n - Point to the end of the circle.\n \n Now, this is the root of your misapplication of reason being inadequate.\n It's not that you're incapable of pointing to the end of something. You can, given the definition of \"end\". You can use reason and do so. However, the request is illogical to begin with, you aren't inadequate to the task. To ask you to point to the end, of that which has no end, is nonsensical. It's not wonder you'd need faith to do this, faith allows for anything since it requires no evidence. You could then claim a circle has an end, or you don't exist, or any number of nonsensical things. To claim reason is inadequate because it cannot allow one to know something that cannot be known, is fallacy.\n \n We can know.\n Understanding of faith requires reason.\n I exist requires no faith, it's self-evident.\n Logic requires no faith, the axioms are self-evident.\n From these self-evident axioms we can reason.\n \n I find it interesting that so many people turn to faith for \"comfort\", thinking it's a foundation of some sort. But faith gives no comfort if you fully accept reason, it's actually denial of reality. And if I have comfort in anything, it's the knowledge that I exist, and the resulting conclusions that I draw, through reason, from this. For you to deny it, denies security, denies comfort, denies good, denies evil, denies everything.\n \n I have comfort in my knowledge, and it's justified. I find no comfort in the unjustified. How can the unknown or unknowable give a reasonable person \"comfort\" or \"security\"? I dont' know, but I feel a foundation, and certainty, give me more comfort than the lack therof.\n \n -Mach\n\n \n Mach:\n \n Your arguments are well thought out. And well reasoned.

If one does not know something but believes it to be true, then one can act as if it were true and TEST that belief. The results will bear out whether or not it is actually true. However, there is a warning in this. One's experimental design is important so as to not introduce confounding factors. Where issues of faith (spiritual for instance) come into play, it must be tested over long periods of time, not simply once or once in a while.\"\n \n Faith is used to test theories. Reason allows a person to draw logical conclusions, but it is faith that requires us to look at those conclusions and test them.\n \n Saying \"I have faith\" is not the same as saying I just believe. Belief and faith are different. Faith means that one has stated a theory and tested it and found it reliable in spite of a lack of physical evidence as to why.

I can't make you have a conception or knowledge of God if you've never experienced God, like with many things.\n Imagine a \"primitive\" culture that has no knowledge or experience of all of our modern conveniences. Imagine trying to explain what a telivision was and how it worked. You could talk about it until you were blue in the face, but they would never understand what a TV was until they saw one working.\n \n\n If your rebuttal is \"you wouldn't understand\", as it obviously seems to be, then you choose rhetoric, which doesn't interest me.\n \n \nI refer you to the research and writings of Antonio Damasio on this count. Read his stuff, and then come back to me on this stuff. I don't really have the time or energy to give a lecture on hi research, but it is essential to understanding the role emotion plays in reason.\n\n Ironic that you claim you don't have time to defend your position, so you refer me to an authority, and command me to spend MY time, to understand YOUR position. Are you serious or just yanking my chain now?\n \n \nI absolutely agree. When did I ever say anything about this to the contrary? Can you point it out for me, cuz I sure don't remember any of it. I also never expressed what you perceive to be my religion. You seem to have a certain affinity for the straw man. Not very reasonable or logical is it?\n\n Yet I don't claim you do.\n \n \nThere you go again. You really are amazing Mach. You apparently think you have some pyschic ability. I never said I was a Christian and I never said I attended church, maybe that's because I don't. Maybe you shouldn't make generalizations based on false assumptions. Does that seem like a reasonable/rational thing to do? It sure doesn't to me, but you just did it.\n\n I never claimed you were a christian, and never claimed you attend church, you're mistaken. I do think you're religious because you profess faith in a god. I hope I didn't misrepresent that. Whether you're part of organized religion or not makes no difference to the arguments.\n \n \n You also need to seperate faith and spirituality from religion, they are not the same thing.\n\n \n Where do I claim spirituality and religion are synonyms? \n \n Yet they do look quite interchangeable, that is, according to the evidence:\n \n http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=spirituality&x=24&y=12\n \n Main Entry: spir\u00b7i\u00b7tu\u00b7al\u00b7i\u00b7ty \n Pronunciation: \"spir-i-ch&-'wa-l&-tE\n Function: noun\n Inflected Form(s): plural -ties\n 1 : something that in ecclesiastical law belongs to the church or to a cleric as such\n 2 : CLERGY\n 3 : sensitivity or attachment to religious values\n 4 : the quality or state of being spiritual \n \n Spiritual:\n 1 : of, relating to, consisting of, or affecting the spirit : INCORPOREAL <man's spiritual needs<\n 2 a : of or relating to sacred matters <spiritual songs< b : ecclesiastical rather than lay or temporal <spiritual authority< <lords spiritual<\n 3 : concerned with religious values\n 4 : related or joined in spirit <our spiritual home< <his spiritual heir<\n 5 a : of or relating to supernatural beings or phenomena b : of, relating to, or involving spiritualism : SPIRITUALISTIC\n ======================\n \n How do you use the term? To mean full of grain alcohol? Otherwise if you claim spirituality, and profess belief in a god, I don't have many other educated guesses other than...you're religious. You can correct me and I'll accept the correction. Are you saying you're not religious..i.e. you have no belief in god? \n \n -Mach",

   "Faith: belief that requires no evidence.\n \n Faith, as a method, is incapable of seperating truth from falsity.\n \n Thus, faith is incapable of seperating true claims, from false claims.\n \n -Mach\n\n \n With this kind of thinking, additional assertions are posited, that there are two kinds of Truth, and that matters of Faith, or Religion are relagated to a fuzzy realm of emotions, feels and matters of the heart. Is that true? When we decide on a spiritual path, or Religion, do we void all evidence and facts, and suspend the search for Truth?\n \n Perhaps, Professor Douglas Groothuis can help us out:\n \n The correspondence view of truth entails that propositional or declarative statements are subject to various kinds of verification and falsification. A statement can be proven false if it can be shown to disagree with objective reality.\n \n Therefore, Christians&#8212;who historically have affirmed (whether implicitly or explicitly) the correspondence view of truth&#8212;hold that there are good historical reasons to believe that Jesus Christ rose from the dead in space-time history, thus vindicating his divine authority (see Romans 1:4; 1 Corinthians 15:1-11). The Apostle Paul was adamant about this: &#8220;And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead&#8221; (1 Corinthians 15:14-15). Without the correspondence view of truth, these resounding affirmations can only ring hollow.\n \n Today this view of truth is being brought into doubt by certain postmodernist philosophers who claim that the quest for an objective truth that is describable through language is part of the discredited project of modernism, an over-confident approach to knowledge stemming from Enlightenment rationalism. Therefore, statements about scientific facts, religious realities, or moral principles cannot be known to refer to objective states of affairs. On the contrary, language is contingently constructed through communities; it cannot transcend its own context and refer to realities outside itself. \n \n A thorough analysis of this postmodernism assault on truth would take us beyond the limits of this essay, but a basic critique of its notion of truth is that this view is self-refuting. If all language fails to describe objective conditions, because of its embeddedness in various cultures, then any language used to describe this universal embeddedness would be subject to the limitations of its context, and so fail to describe the universal limitations of all languages.2 For all its protests about the illegitimacies of &#8220;metanarratives&#8221; (comprehensive explanations of reality), postmodernism covertly (and illogically) presents a metanarrative of its own.3\n \n Moreover, the notion that objective truth is unknowable entails that a relativistic and/or pragmatic view of truth be put in the place of a correspondence view. I will argue below that both of these views are logically unsupportable. \n \n One challenge to the correspondence view is relativism. Relativism comes in various shapes and sizes, but its salient claim is that the truth of a statement depends on the views of persons or cultures, not on whether statements correspond to objective reality. For a statement to be true simply means that a person or culture to believes it to be true. Hence the popular refrain, &#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s true for you . . .&#8221; or, &#8220;We can&#8217;t judge other cultures.&#8221; According to this view, one person can say &#8220;Jesus is Lord&#8221; and another can say &#8220;Allah is Lord,&#8221; and both statements will be true, if they accurately express the sentiments of the speakers. This view seems to advance tolerance and civility, but it does so at the expense of logic. \n \n If I say &#8220;Jesus is Lord&#8221; and you say &#8220;Allah is Lord&#8221; both statements cannot be objectively true because they describe mutually exclusive realities. Jesus is known by Christians as God made flesh (John 1:14), while Muslims deny that Allah incarnates. If &#8220;Lord&#8221; means a position of unrivaled metaphysical and spiritual supremacy, then Jesus and Allah cannot be both be Lord because &#8220;Jesus&#8221; and &#8220;Allah&#8221; are not two words that mean the same thing. If we mean to say that I believe in Jesus and you believe in Allah, there is no logical contradiction, since subjective states of mind cannot contradict each other; that is, it may be true that I subjectively believe X and you subjectively believe non-X. But X and non-X themselves cannot both be objectively true. When dealing with divergent claims to objective truth (as we often do in comparative religion and philosophy), contradictions emerge frequently.4\n \n When truth is deemed dependent upon the person or culture holding the belief, anything can become &#8220;true,&#8221; which is absurd.\n \n Moreover, relativism is self-refuting; it cuts its own throat. The statement, &#8220;truth is a matter of personal and cultural values, not a matter of a statement&#8217;s correspondence with objective reality,&#8221; is a claim about &#8220;the ways things are&#8221;; that is, it is a truth-claim about objective reality. But this is the very thing it cannot be. If truth is only a function of individual preferences, one cannot escape the prison of subjectivity in order to make objective statements that supposedly apply to all of reality. For these reasons, we can safely say that relativism is false; it does not correspond to reality.\n \n Douglas Grootuis, Ph.D. - Click HERE",

Apologists for the Christian doctrine of creation ought not to think that the initial \"singularity\" of traditional Big Bang cosmology offers scientific confirmation of their view. Nor ought those who reject the doctrine of creation think that recent variations in Big Bang cosmology support their view. Even if the universe were the result of the fluctuation of a primal vacuum, it would not be a self-creating universe. The need to explain the existence of things does not disappear.

   "This post does nicely over here as well:\n \n Quote:\n \n Very simply stated, truth is the judgment expressed when we use the word \"is.\"\n \n The verb \"is\" asserts some-thing about reality to which the statement conforms. \n \n In other words, the statement \"This is so,\" expresses a state of existence that is real, and not dependent on belief in it in order to make it true. The reality being represented is objective, universal, and transcendent. This is precisely the logic by which we operate, and the logic by which we either make statements about reality or make denials about what is not real. \n \n \"The logic of truth is the same for all exclusionary claims to truth\"\n \n (Mortimer Adler, Truth in Religion, p. 10).\n \n Truth by definition is exclusive. If truth were all-inclusive, nothing would be false. And if nothing were false, what would be the meaning of true? Furthermore, if nothing were false, would it be true to say that everything is false? It quickly becomes evident that nonsense would follow. In short, therefore, truth boils down to two tests: Statements must correspond to reality, and any system of thought that is developed as a result must be coherent. The correspondence and coherence tests are applied by all of us in matters that affect us.\n \n Therefore, when Jesus said, \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No man comes to the Father except through me,\" He was making a very reasonable statement by affirming truth's exclusivity. \n \n The question one may legitimately ask is whether He demonstrated that claim rather than just stating it.\n \n The Inextinguishable Light\n\n \n Richbee, you posted this exact same post a few posts back.",

   "Incorrect. If we have evidence, indirect or otherwise, we can claim knowledge. Don't exclude indirect evidence as evidence, all evidence is \"indirect\", by definition (obtained through sense), it can't be excluded from itself. Faith requires no evidence, not reason.\n \n \n \n Infinity is tricky, but is generally still consistent either way it's approached.\n I have a short answer and a longer answer, both very plain-english. I'll start with short.\n \n To say \"one cannot know infinity\", needs to be clarified as being:\n - claims of something \"real\" that are infinite\n - claims of the concept of infinite in terms of \"not having an end\".\n \n Conceptually, we can know infinity. Natural numbers (1, 2, 3...)\n If I give you a number, any number, can you tell me if it's in the set of natural numbers? Yes. Will adding 1 to any number..ANY number, result in a larger number, and if this is repeated (recursion) will this end? No.\n \n We do not rely on faith. To rely on faith and claim knowledge of infinity is meaningless, we can't have reasonable discussions BASED on faith, since reason requires evidence, and faith does not. As illustrated below:\n \n I believe based on faith, that infinity has an end.\n I believe based on faith that infinity has no end.\n \n Both of these are true or false, based on no evidence, and are logical absurdities. Faith cannot give us knowledge, by definition, nor can faith let us know the unknowable, or the concept of infinity. The concept of infinity has no meaning without reason, even the concept of faith has no meaning, without reason. It's not the other way around, to suggest it is begs the question, which you should avoid.\n \n Reason requires faith. False.\n Faith requires reason. True.\n \n The foundation of reason: \"I exist\" is an axiom, self-evidence.\n The foundation of faith \"Proof without evidence\"\n \n To even make a claim of a definition of faith, requires acceptance of the foundations of reason..i.e. existence, identify, consciousness, a is a, excluded middle, either a or not a.\n \n Thus, to make meaningfull claims require reason, faith requires reason, without reason, faith has no meaning.\n ===============================================\n \n Another example:\n Take a circle, an infinite loop.\n - Point to the end of the circle.\n \n Now, this is the root of your misapplication of reason being inadequate.\n It's not that you're incapable of pointing to the end of something. You can, given the definition of \"end\". You can use reason and do so. However, the request is illogical to begin with, you aren't inadequate to the task. To ask you to point to the end, of that which has no end, is nonsensical. It's not wonder you'd need faith to do this, faith allows for anything since it requires no evidence. You could then claim a circle has an end, or you don't exist, or any number of nonsensical things. To claim reason is inadequate because it cannot allow one to know something that cannot be known, is fallacy.\n \n We can know.\n Understanding of faith requires reason.\n I exist requires no faith, it's self-evident.\n Logic requires no faith, the axioms are self-evident.\n From these self-evident axioms we can reason.\n \n I find it interesting that so many people turn to faith for \"comfort\", thinking it's a foundation of some sort. But faith gives no comfort if you fully accept reason, it's actually denial of reality. And if I have comfort in anything, it's the knowledge that I exist, and the resulting conclusions that I draw, through reason, from this. For you to deny it, denies security, denies comfort, denies good, denies evil, denies everything.\n \n I have comfort in my knowledge, and it's justified. I find no comfort in the unjustified. How can the unknown or unknowable give a reasonable person \"comfort\" or \"security\"? I dont' know, but I feel a foundation, and certainty, give me more comfort than the lack therof.\n \n -Mach\n\n \n Your arguments are good but I think you are running against empiricism and the falacy of equivocation. To say that the \"Concept\" of infinity can be known and therefore infinity can be known is equivocating the meaning of the word known.\n \n Likewise, take a look at mathematical postulates concerning points. it was at the end of my post prior to this one of yours. The point is non-dimensional and non existent in reality. however, if there are an infinite number of them, they make a line. A line is defined as a set of points described by an equation of the first degree with at least one variable. There are an infinite number of points on a line. Likewise a plane is described as a line and a point not on the line. there are an infinite number of points in a plane. Space is defined as a plane and a point not on a plane. There are an infinite number of points in space.\n \n now: infinity = infinity = infinity (by reflexivity) but points, lines, planes, and space, are all very different and very real. We must accept on faith that a point is nondimensional. There is no way to prove it. It is a foundational concept of mathematics though. \n \n For any system of logical conclusions there must be assumptions. If we get to the base assumptions we realize that they are things that cannot be proven. They must simply be accepted.\n \n I do not say that reason requires faith but faith does not require reason. I say that they require each other or both are meaningless.",

   "EF,\n First, no need to respond to any of this, I know you're busy, we don't have any contest of wills on the line here :) I learn a lot just by thinking through the issues and consider it time well spent either way.\n \n \nYour arguments are good but I think you are running against empiricism and the falacy of equivocation. To say that the \"Concept\" of infinity can be known and therefore infinity can be known is equivocating the meaning of the word known.\n\n \n Then we agree. Non-dimensional and infinite need not be taken on faith, they are reasoned, or they are contradictions (as applied to something we claim we can observe that is infinite, or non-dimensional). Interesting note, the universe is claimed to be infinite, yet not completely observable. I'm not sure the philosophical implications of this. \n \n \nLikewise, take a look at mathematical postulates concerning points. it was at the end of my post prior to this one of yours.

They must simply be accepted.\n \n \n \n Yes, but I don't disagree with that, I do disagree that you say we need to accept all this on faith. Acceptance is a word not synonymous with faith. Also, you're using axiom in place of faith. \n \n We don't have to:\n \"accept points as nondimensional based on faith.\"\n \n We can choose to logically accept accept this as axiomatic for the system of [appropriate math goes here].\n \n We have a word for axioms, and it's not based on nothing, or whim. It's based on other defined words, with specific meanings, and through reasoned acceptance. In the system of [insert math here], these axioms are the foundation for the entire logical system. We do not claim they \"exist\", nor do we claim they are \"true\". It's a conceptual reference point for logical inquiry, nothing more.\n \n Think of axioms like this. The 0 point of the cartesian plane. Does it exist? no. Is there some formula for it? no. Can it be proven? no. Ah, but does it provide a reference for other logical statements when combiend with other axioms (such as set theory)? Yes! Humans seems to have a pre-set reference point for rational thought (I exist), so naturally, or logically, I don't know which, we assume reference points when dealing with most conceptual (non-real) systems where dimensions are applicable. Kind of neat how that works I think.\n \n In the end I think it's a definitions issue again. I think the common use of the word \"faith\", spills over into areas it doesn't belong (for everyone, even in some cases dictionaries). Believing in something as true based on faith is fallacy, if you accept logic, no matter what the object of the belief is. \n \n Acceptance\n Axiom\n Faith\n \n Three distinct meanings. \n \n -Mach",
