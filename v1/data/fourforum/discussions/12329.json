   "You can't see Russia from Texas.\n \n But that's where some of the money that helped an effort aiming to kill a probe investigating whether Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin acted inappropriately in firing the state's public safety chief came from.\n \n Gift records show that an evangelical group and two law firms working with it shelled out $185,000 to represent six Alaska legislators in an unsuccessful bid to quash the state legislature's investigation into \"troopergate.\"\n \n The evangelical group -- Liberty Legal Institute -- is affiliated with Focus on the Family's James Dobson. Liberty is the legal arm of the Free Market Foundation, which \"lists its guiding principles as limited government and promotion of Judeo-Christian values,\" according to the Anchorage Daily News.\n \n On Friday, Gov. Sarah Palin's husband Todd was held in contempt by the Alaska State Senate. The news was barely reported -- and seemed relatively fruitless from a national political standpoint, since it came months after Palin's failed bid for the presidency.\n \n The gift records also show an in-kind contribution of legal services from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP totaling $120,000, a national lawfirm appearing on behalf of Liberty Legal, and $40,000 from the firm of Alaska attorney Kevin Clarkson.\n \n That brings the total bill for their lawsuit to $185,000.\n \n The suit against the legislators pursuing charges against those probing Palin was dismissed last fall. All six men who filed the suit were Republicans.\n \n \"I said so, who is paying who to do this?\" Carl Gatto, one of the lawmakers involved in the suit, said. \"And they said they were volunteering, the attorneys were volunteering. Then I discovered I had to report it as gifts. So I did.\"\n \n \"If you feel like there is an injustice being done you have a right to file a lawsuit,\" he added.\n \n The lawyer who defended the Legislative Council against that lawsuit and two others seeking to stop the \"troopergate\" investigation was shocked when called by the Anchorage Daily News.\n \n \"Wow,\" he said. The Raw Story | Texas evangelicals funded effort to kill Palin 'troopergate' probe\n \n emoticon_wow\n \"Wow\" is right.\n \n But I imagine these church organizations' \"tax exempt\" status shouldn't be touched? emoticon_emb",

If the 1st amendment really applies to the extent you seem to think it does regarding religion, it should do so (as a moral standard) taxed or not.\n \n On another note, the \"troopergate\" political anti-Palin circus certainly SHOULD have been stopped, by a lot more people than just religious groups.",

   "So, if they started paying taxes, you'd really leave them alone at that point and no longer complain if they engage in such things? emoticon_xangel\n\n Gee.\n Did I say that?\n I don't remember saying that...\n \n \n \nAs I pointed out in a different thread, separation of C&S is an important ideal independent of the taxation issue.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n No. It's not.\n Your argument is a ridiculously specious one.\n \n It's like saying \"the government doesn't really care if you speed 15 MPH over the limit. All you have to do is pay a fine (analogously, taxes) and that's it.\"\n Just because churches can pay a \"fine\" (i.e. taxes) doesn't mean that tax exemption isn't related to separation of church and state.\n \n \n \nIf the 1st amendment really applies to the extent you seem to think it does regarding religion, it should do so (as a moral standard) taxed or not.\n\n Do you realize how many laws out there revolve on somebody paying a \"fine\" to get out of it?\n Does that mean the \"moral standard\" of the law doesn't exist if the \"fine\" can be paid? emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nOn another note, the \"troopergate\" political anti-Palin circus certainly SHOULD have been stopped, by a lot more people than just religious groups.\n\n It was a valid issue.\n And the fact that Palin's family, and a variety of other people, stuck their thumb up at justice and refused to aid the investigation only demonstrates how much Palin disrespected the law.\n \n Palin reminded me of a bad combination of Bush and Cheney.\n Bush's brain, with Cheney's attitude.\n She cost McCain votes. emoticon_xgood",

I really think you need to take your own analogy to heart.\n \n \nIt [troopergate]was a valid issue.\n\n \n Obviously not, since they were exonerated and found to have not engaged in any wrong-doing. Of course, that was after the election, so the political damage was already done. (Which was no doubt the real purpose of the witch hunt. Timing is more important than the actual truth itself, when it comes to sustaining political damage,I suppose.)",
