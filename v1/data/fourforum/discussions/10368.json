   "Sorry, I just found this thread. I hope I'm not too late to make a prediction. emoticon_smile I'm betting that the New England Patriots go all the way and have a perfect season. \n \n Just think, prior to losing to the Colts on this day, last year, the Pats won 21 straight games. Since that single loss, they went on to win the next 19 games culminating in todays win over the Chargers. 2 losses in 40 games is another NFL record the Pats can be proud of.\n \n And the Giants will get crushed by the Packers I predict. That game just started moments ago.",
