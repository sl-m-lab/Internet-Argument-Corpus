   "And Obama got the point. This small town girl took on the Washington elite and put them on notice that change is coming to town. All of the small town people in America whom Obama has insulted as either coming from towns too small to qualify them for being Vice President, or for clinging to their guns and their religion to embrace a person like him, will send their message loud and clear come November 4th. And all of the slanderous defamation of character that the extreme left sexists throw at her will only feed the resolve of middle America against what the Obama haters represent. PTL emoticon_xangel\n Palin casts herself as Washington outsider\n \n By TOM RAUM and LIZ SIDOTI, Associated Press Writers\n 21 mins ago\n ST. PAUL, Minn. - Greeted by thunderous applause, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin presented herself to the Republican National Convention on Wednesday, and millions of Americans watching from home, as a small-town outsider ready to join John McCain's ticket in waging \"a tough fight in this election against confident opponents at a crucial hour for our country.\"\n \"I will be honored to accept the nomination for vice president of the United States,\" she said in the convention's most anticipated speech. The 44-year-old, self-described \"hockey mom\" still awaits formal nomination for the second spot on the ticket.\n With those words, the crowd roared - and the flashes of thousands of cameras reflected off her glasses.\n It was the crowning moment of a roller-coaster week in which the first woman ever on a Republican presidential ticket has faced questions about how closely the McCain campaign scrutinized her. She also has heard a wide range of inquiries about family issues, her policy positions and her record of public service.\n Palin took crowd-delighting swipes at Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and what she called the \"Washington elite.\"\n \"The American presidency is not supposed to be a journey of 'personal discovery.' This world of threats and dangers is not just a community, and it doesn't just need an organizer,\" Palin said, a clear reference to Obama's time as a community organizer in Chicago.\n And to the media that had closely examined her record, she said: \"Here's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion. I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country.\"\n As she concluded her speech, her family and then McCain greeted her on stage. \"Don't you think we made the right choice for the next vice president. What a beautiful family,\" McCain said to loud cheers.\n The Obama campaign had less than a warm greeting, saying Palin's speech was \"written by George Bush's speechwriter and sounds exactly like the same divisive, partisan attacks we've heard from George Bush for the last eight years.\" The speech was written by Matthew Scully, who met Palin for the first time last week.\n Selected by McCain only last Friday, Palin addressed the convention amid questions about her qualifications and relative lack of experience.\n The first-term governor had top billing at the convention on a night delegates also lined up for a noisy roll call of the states to deliver their presidential nomination to McCain.\n Watching her speech were her husband Todd and their children, including 17-year-old Bristol Palin, whom the Palins disclosed earlier in the week was five months pregnant. Bristol Palin's 18-year-old boyfriend and apparent fiance, Levi Johnston, was seated with them.\n McCain shook up the presidential race by picking Palin, a little-known governor less than two years in office. Since then, a bright spotlight has been trained on the life and record of the Republican governor who has bucked the state's political establishment.\n Days after Palin made her debut on the national stage with McCain, the campaign announced her unmarried daughter's pregnancy. Other disclosures followed, including that a private attorney is authorized to spend $95,000 of state money to defend her against accusations of abuse of power and that Palin sought pork-barrel projects for her city and state, contrary to her reformist image.\n \"Our family has the same ups and downs as any other ... the same challenges and the same joys,\" she said.\n Noting that the couple's oldest son, Track, 19, was shipping out to Iraq in eight days with the Army infantry, Palin praised McCain as \"a true profile in courage, and people like that are hard to come by.\"\n \"He's a man who wore the uniform of this country for 22 years, and refused to break faith with those troops in Iraq who have now brought victory within sight. And as the mother of one of those troops, that is exactly the kind of man I want as commander in chief,\" she said.\n Largely unknown outside her home state, Palin told the convention: \"I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town. I was just your average hockey mom, and signed up for the PTA because I wanted to make my kids' public education better,\" she said, speaking of her home town of Wasilla, Alaska, with a population of about 6,500.\n \"When I ran for city council, I didn't need focus groups and voter profiles because I knew those voters, and knew their families, too,\" she said.\n Before becoming governor, Palin served as mayor of Wasilla, she recounted, adding: \"And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look down on that experience, let me explain to them what the job involves. I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a 'community organizer,' except that you have actual responsibilities.\"\n In another barb directed at the Illinois Democrat, Palin said: \"Here's how I look at the choice Americans face in this election. In politics, there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers. And then there are those, like John McCain, who use their careers to promote change.\"\n A former TV sportscaster, Palin delivered her speech in a firm, cheerful voice. It was her first chance to introduce and define herself to the American public and to explain to fellow Republicans how her experiences as Alaska governor would help galvanize the GOP ticket.\n She strongly endorsed more oil exploration and drilling. \"Our opponents say, again and again, that drilling will not solve all of America's energy problems - as if we all didn't know that already. But the fact that drilling won't solve every problem is no excuse to do nothing at all,\" she said.\n Palin has been an aggressive advocate for drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, while McCain opposes drilling there. That difference was not touched on in the speech.http://www.yahoo.com/s/947451",

The reason she was anything but shrill as Harry Reid said, is because everything she said was so true, and the truth only hurts those who are convicted by it which is why dems all over the Country are going apoplectic right now. She proved beyond any doubt, as did the Governor or Hawaii who also spoke tonight, that she is far more qualified in very real ways than Obama could ever hope to be. \n \n And even Obama himself proved that today in an interview. He was asked about Sarah's Executive experience and the claims that she has more real world executive experience than he does, and his reply was that well, uh, I've been running my campaign for the past 18 months! Which was also a lie because we all know that every candidate has a paid campaign manager and professional handlers who feed them lines like puppet masters. He not only so much as admitted he has no practical executive experience, he embarrassed himself in a huge way on National TV. I just love it.",

But I'm going to make a prediction here, with her specific knowledge about being an executive officer of a State, I'll bet she raises issues in the debate that a career legislator like Biden will have absolutely no clue about. I predict she will crush him with real world scenarios and situations that he is unaware of at all. Her experience will shine in contrast to his smoke and mirrors. \n \n Remember, it's true that she has real experience that legislators don't have, that isn't just a political line.

   "I just found this very disturbing article about Obama and help he received getting into Harvard by a muslim with extremist ties. This is an excerpt from the lower half of the article.\n \n http://news.newsmax.com/?SKCD.qG7Hy0KPuXHunwGY8RZn3bktJU1S&http://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/obama_sutton_saudi/2008/09/03/127490.html?s=al&promo_code=692E-1\n Khalid al-Mansour a.k.a. Don Warden\n \n In an exclusive interview with Newsmax from his home in San Antonio, Texas, al-Mansour said he would not comment specifically on the statement by Percy Sutton because he was afraid anything he said would get &#8220;distorted.&#8221;\n \n &#8220;I was determined I was never going to be in that situation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Bloggers are saying this is the new Rev. Wright &#8212; in drag! &#8212; and he is a nationalist, racist, and worse than Rev. Wright. So any statement that I made would only further this activity which is not in the interest of Barack.&#8221;\n \n But in the lengthy interview, al-Mansour confirmed that he frequently spoke on university campuses, including Columbia, where Percy Sutton suggested he met Obama in the late 1980s, and confirmed his close relationship with Prince Alwaleed.\n \n &#8220;I am not surprised to learn about this,&#8221; said Niger Innis, spokesman of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). &#8220;It is clear that Barack Obama&#8217;s ties to the left are familial, generational, and have lasted for several years.&#8221;\n \n Although many Americans have never heard of Khalid Abdullah Tariq al-Mansour (his full name), he is well known within the black community as a lawyer, an orthodox Muslim, a black nationalist, an author, an international deal-maker, an educator, and an outspoken enemy of Israel.\n \n A graduate of Howard University with a law degree from the University of California, al-Mansour sits on numerous corporate boards, including the Saudi African Bank and Chicago-based LaGray Chemical Co. LaGray, which was formed to do business in Africa, counts former Nigerian President General Abdusalam Abubakar on its advisory board.\n \n He also sits on the board of the non-profit African Leadership Academy, along with top McCain for President adviser Carly Fiorina, and organized a tribute to the President of Ghana at the Clinton White House in 1995, along with pop star Michael Jackson.\n \n But his writings and books are packed with anti-American rhetoric reminiscent of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama&#8217;s disgraced former pastor.\n \n In a 1995 book, &#8220;The Lost Books of Africa Rediscovered,&#8221; he alleged that the United States was plotting genocide against black Americans.\n \n The first \"genocide against the black man began 300 years ago,\" he told an audience in Harlem at a book-signing, while a second \"genocide\" was on the way &#8220;to remove 15 million Black people, considered disposable, of no relevance, value or benefit to the American society.&#8221;\n \n In the 1960s, when he founded the African American Association in the San Francisco Bay area, he was known as Donald Warden.\n \n According to the Social Activism Project at the University of California at Berkley, Warden, a.k.a. Khalid al-Mansour, was the mentor of Black Panther Party founder Huey Newton and his cohort, Bobby Seale.\n \n Newton later had a falling out with Warden, who was described in a 1994 book as &#8220;the most articulate spokesperson for black nationalism&#8221; at the time.\n \n The falling out wasn&#8217;t purely political, according to author Hugh Pearson.\n \n &#8220;Sometimes Newton and the other members of (Warden&#8217;s) security detail got into fights with young whites who didn&#8217;t like what Warden had to say about whites. Rather than &#8216;throw down&#8217; along with the security detail, Warden refused to fight,&#8221; Pearson wrote in &#8220;Shadow of the Panther: Huey Newton and the Price of Black Power in America.&#8221;\n \n U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee of California entered an official statement of appreciation of Warden and his Black Panther colleagues in the African-American Association in the Congressional Record on April 23, 2007.\n \n &#8220;Among the founding members (of the Association) were community leaders such as Khalid Al-Mansour (known then as Don Warden); future Judges Henry Ramsey and Thelton Henderson; future Congressman and Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums, and future Black Panthers Huey Newton and Bobby Seale,&#8221; the Democratic representative&#8217;s statement said.\n \n Al-Mansour&#8217;s more recent videotaped speeches focus on Muslim themes, and abound with anti-Semitic theories and anti-Israel vitriol.\n \n &#8220;Today, the Palestinians are being brutalized like savages,&#8221; he told an audience in South Africa. &#8220;If you protest you will go to jail, and you may be killed. And they say they are the only democratic country in the Middle East. ... They are lying on God.&#8221;\n \n He accused the Jews of &#8220;stealing the land the same way the Christians stole the land from the Indians in America.&#8221;\n \n The Saudi Connection\n \n But al-Mansour&#8217;s sponsorship of Obama as a prospective Harvard law student is important for another reason beyond his Islamic and anti-American rhetoric and early Black Panther ties.\n \n At the time Percy Sutton, a former lawyer for Malcolm X and a former business partner of al-Mansour, says he was raising money for Obama&#8217;s graduate school education, al-Mansour was representing top members of the Saudi Royal family seeking to do business and exert influence in the United States.\n \n In 1989, for example &#8212; just one year after Obama entered Harvard Law School &#8212; The Los Angeles Times revealed that al-Mansour had been advising Saudi billionaires Abdul Aziz and Khalid al-Ibrahim in their secret effort to acquire a major stake in prime oceanfront property in Marina del Rey, Calif., through &#8220;an elaborate network of corporate shells in California, the Caribbean and Europe.&#8221;\n \n At the same time, he was also advising Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in his U.S. investments, and sits on the board of his premier investment vehicle, Kingdom Holdings.\n \n Prince Alwaleed, 53, is the nephew if King Abdallah of Saudi Arabia. Forbes magazine ranked him this year as the 19th richest person on the planet, with a fortune in excess of $23 billion. He owns large chunks of Citigroup and News Corp., the holding company that controls Fox News.\n \n He is best known in the United States for his offer to donate $10 million to help rebuild downtown Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks. But after the prince made a public comment suggesting that U.S. policies had contributed to causing the attacks, Mayor Rudy Giuliani handed back his check.\n \n \"I entirely reject that statement,\" Giuliani said. \"There is no moral equivalent for this (terrorist) act. There is no justification for it. The people who did it lost any right to ask for justification for it when they slaughtered 4,000 or 5,000 innocent people.&#8221;\n \n Since then, Prince Alwaleed&#8217;s Kingdom Foundation has given millions of dollars to Muslim charities in the United States, including several whose leaders have been indicted on terrorism-related charges in federal courts.\n \n He also has given tens of millions of dollars to Harvard and other major U.S. universities, to establish programs in Islamic studies.\n \n The casual statement by Percy Sutton to NY1 is the first time anyone has hinted at a relationship between Obama and the Saudi royal family.\n \n Although al-Mansour glosses over his ties to the Saudi mega-billionaire in some of his public talks, he has represented the Saudi&#8217;s interests in the United States, in Britain, and in Africa for more than a quarter century, according to public records.\n \n He told Newsmax that he has personally introduced Prince Alwaleed to &#8220;51 of the 53 leaders of Africa,&#8221; traveling from country to country on the Saudi prince&#8217;s private jet.\n \n He knows virtually every black leader in America, from the business community, to community activists, to the worlds of politics and entertainment.\n \n When Michael Jackson was on the ropes in the mid-1990s following a series of lawsuits by the parents of children accusing him of sexual abuse, al-Mansour introduced him to Prince Alwaleed, whose Kingdom Entertainment signed a joint venture with Jackson in 1996.\n \n &#8220;Jackson and Alwaleed became pals in 1994, when a mutual friend from Alwaleed's college days in California arranged a lunch meeting aboard the prince's yacht in Cannes,&#8221; Time magazine reported about the new partnership in 1997.\n \n The mutual friend was al-Mansour.\n \n &#8220;As a black American, I am exceedingly proud at the American people&#8217;s response to Barack Obama&#8217;s candidacy,&#8221; said CORE&#8217;s Niger Innis. &#8220;But to deny that he has long-standing ties to left-wing elements in our polity is to deny reality. If you want to be president of the United States, it is not racism if you ask these kind of questions, and he has to come up with an answer, hopefully the truth.&#8221;\n \n Sutton gives no clues as to why al-Mansour would be raising money to help Obama go to law school. Obama has said during his campaign that he paid his way through Harvard with student loans.\n \n For Jesse Lee Peterson, founder of the Los Angeles-based Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny (BOND), these latest revelations about Obama&#8217;s ties to Saudi financiers were an important wake-up call.\n \n &#8220;To me, this opened up more questions about Barack Obama and his relationship to the Muslim world,&#8221; Peterson told Newsmax.\n \n &#8220;A lot of people are caught up with the emotional aspect of Barack Obama, the movie star aspect, the false promises that he&#8217;s going to take care of everyone and their Mama.&#8221;\n \n But when the full story of Obama&#8217;s ties to radical preachers such as Wright and to black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan comes out, Peterson believes that Obama&#8217;s star power will fade.\n \n &#8220;I think there&#8217;s more to this story and to Barack Obama than we realize,&#8221; Peterson said. &#8220;As all the truth comes out before the election, I don&#8217;t think he has a chance. I can&#8217;t see American&#8217;s taking that kind of risk.&#8221;\n \n The Obama campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n \n Percy Sutton Reveals Association Between Khalid al-Mansour and Obama at Age 25",

   "Even the Main Stream Media couldn't deny the obvious regarding Palins acceptance speech. \n Palin provides a 'perfect populist pitch'\n \n By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer\n Thu Sep 4, 12:57 am ET\n NEW YORK - With a forceful speech that served as her introduction to millions of Americans on Wednesday, Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin seduced many on television who had spent days doubting her candidacy.\n \n It wasn't just a home run, said CNN's Wolf Blitzer; \n it may have been a grand slam. \"A very auspicious debut,\" said NBC's Tom Brokaw. \n It was a \"perfect populist pitch,\" said CBS' Jeff Greenfield. \n \"Terrific,\" said Mort Kondracke on Fox News Channel.\n \"A star is born,\" said Chris Wallace on Fox.\n \"A star is born,\" Blitzer said.\n \"A star is born,\" said Anderson Cooper on CNN.\n Palin combined jokes about being a hockey mom with searing criticism of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama. It was a spur to a convention audience ready to get worked up, to a large extent because Republican leaders had pushed the notion that the news media was being sexist or too aggressive in questioning her qualifications for the job.\n For a relative rookie on the national stage, however, she understood the nuances of speaking to a television audience better than the more experienced and fiery Rudolph Giuliani.\n Cameras lingered on shots of her family in the audience - her dozing infant passed from her husband to a daughter, her pregnant teen-aged daughter gripping the hand of her boyfriend, her soldier son about to be dispatched to Iraq.\n \"I've learned quickly, these past few days, that if you're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite, then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone,\" Palin said.\n At that, some on the convention floor chanted \"N-B-C, N-B-C.\"http://www.yahoo.com/s/947627",

You want someone who is an \"outsider\", who will do things differently and do what's neccesary-exactly what Obama is campaigning on-but he's too inexperienced. So you rally behind McCain-a 20+ year Washington \"insider\", who promises to keep doing what Bush is doing, and names a VP with 1 1/2 years experience as a governer, who drove her own business into the ground and has already been caught in a couple of lies. I'm not supporting Obama here, I'm just pointing out the mind boggling hypocrisy and contortions American voters seem to put themselves through.\n \n \nDear Joe who got less votes in the State of Iowa than Sarah Palin got in Wassila Alaska when she was running for Mayor. How ironic is that for a humorous little factoid?\n\n It's not ironic, it's flat out false. See what happens when you parrot instead of fact check?",

She has been governor of Alaska for less than 2 years, and her experience as mayor of a tiny little city is hardly relevant to the high office to which she aspires now. \n \n Members of Congress do govern. The executive is one branch of the federal government. And members of the Senate in particular, with 6-year terms, are expected to exercise independent judgment, not merely to represent the wishes of the voters in a particular district. (This is actually one of the questions that we Americans debate: the extent to which those we elect to the two branches of Congress should act as representatives of the wishes of the voters and the extent to which they are elected to exercise independent judgment. A big difference between the House and the Senate is the extent to which we give the Senators the opportunity and responsibility to exercise independent judgment, given that they don't run for re-election every two years.) \n \n I do not dislike Republicans. I dislike the direction the Republican Party has taken in recent years, and I disagree with the Republican Party on most issues. I have voted for Republicans in the past. I used to vote regularly for my Republican Congressman in Massachusetts, the late Silvio Conte. A Republican friend and colleague, who is an economist and also the mayor of a small city bigger than Wasilla, Alaska, says that he is dismayed by the direction his own party has taken in pandering to the religious right. He says, \"My party left me. I didn't change; my party changed.\" And it's true. The Republican Party has moved so far to the right that they have driven away or alienated many of the moderates and reasonable people. My friend is still a Republican, but he cringes over what the party has been standing for and doing recently. It's no surprise to me that the Republican Party has become mostly the party of white people. They have only 36 African American delegates at their convention this year, fewer than they have had in the last 40 years. They don't represent what the United States looks like. They represent the most radical right-wing slice of Americans.\n \n Republicans used to stand for civil rights. Republicans used to stand for fiscal responsibility. Republicans used to stand for careful use of American power, not irresponsible invasions of other countries. \n \n It's not the Republicans I dislike. It's what the party has become that I dislike.",

   "Here are some Poll results that oughta make the liberals blood run cold!\n Palin Power: Fresh Face Now More Popular Than Obama, McCain\n \n rasmussenreports.com\n Fri Sep 5, 12:04 pm ET\n A week ago, most Americans had never heard of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Now, following a Vice Presidential acceptance speech viewed live by more than 40 million people, Palin is viewed favorably by 58% of American voters. The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 37% hold an unfavorable view of the self-described hockey mom.\n The figures include 40% with a Very Favorable opinion of Palin and 18% with a Very Unfavorable view. Before her acceptance speech, Palin was viewed favorably by 52%. A week ago, 67% had never heard of her.\n The new data also shows significant increases in the number who say McCain made the right choice and the number who say Palin is ready to be President. Generally, John McCain's choice of Palin earns slightly better reviews than Barack Obama's choice of Joe Biden.\n Perhaps most stunning is the fact that Palin's favorable ratings are now a point higher than either man at the top of the Presidential tickets this year. As of Friday morning, Obama and McCain are each viewed favorably by 57% of voters. Biden is viewed favorably by 48%.\n There is a strong partisan gap when it comes to perceptions of Palin. Eighty-nine percent (89%) of Republicans give her favorable reviews along with 33% of Democrats and 59% of voters not affiliated with either major party.\n She earns positive reviews from 65% of men and 52% of women. The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll shows that Obama continues to lead McCain among women voters while McCain leads among men. The Friday morning update??????the first to include interviews conducted after Palin's speech--showed the beginning of a Republican convention bounce that may match Obama's bounce from last week.\n Fifty-one percent (51%) of Americans believe that most reporters are trying to hurt Palin's campaign, a fact that may enhance her own ratings.\n (Want a free daily e-mail update? Sign up now. If it's in the news, it's in our polls. Get our daily update and we'll let you know what voters really think.)\n The Palin pick has also improved perceptions of John McCain. A week ago, just before he introduced his running mate, just 42% of Republicans had a Very Favorable opinion of their party's nominee. That figure jumped to 54% by this Friday morning. Among unaffiliated voters, favorable opinions of McCain have increased by eleven percentage points in a week from 54% before the Palin announcement to 65% today.\n Fifty-one percent (51%) of all voters now believe that McCain made the right choice when he picked Palin to be his running mate while 32% disagree. By way of comparison, on the night after Biden gave his acceptance speech, 47% said that Obama made the right choice.\n Eighty-one percent (81%) of Republicans say that McCain made the right choice while just 69% of Democrats said the same about Obama.\n Among unaffiliated voters, 52% said that McCain made the right choice for his running mate and 45% said the same about Obama.\n Forty percent (40%) now say that Palin is ready to be President, if necessary. That's up from 29% last week. Forty-nine percent (49%) say the same about Biden.http://www.yahoo.com/s/948416",

   "What has been so enlightening for the average voter throughout this past week since Sarah Palin gave her acceptance speech at the convention, and even before that actually, has been the obvious double standard and hypocrisy of the Left regarding how they feel justified in treating the opposition as they have relied on false accusations against her and make those assertions in the spirit of reporting the News. Yet, when their false accusations are exposed as lies and misrepresentations of the truth, and they get called out and excoriated for their slander, all of a sudden they accuse the Right of treating them unfairly, ignoring the issues and resorting to the politics of personal destruction.\n \n It is incredible that they see no problem with attacking every aspect of Palins personal life, yet when the response from the public is fierce and condemning of them, they immediately resort to claiming to be victims of unfair treatment. When they pass untruths about the Right, that is just reporting the News. But when they get condemned publicly for reporting lies, all of a sudden the political debate is off topic and they are being unfairly attacked. Maybe if Obama will concentrate on actually running against McCain for President, rather than Palin and George Bush who aren't running for the top spot, maybe he wont get himself into so much trouble. \n \n Obama has accused the McCain supporters of creating an alliance in order to form a coordinated effort to attack him. But what he doesn't admit to is that his side is sending an army of lawyers to Alaska so that they can dig into every aspect of Sarah Palins life for any dirt that can be found on her. And what is so frustrating for them is that their search thus far has only led to dead ends. Sarah Palin is truly an excellent example of an average American Citizen who has found success in the same way that cream rises to the top in a bottle of milk. She just is a good person and a good woman.\n \n Is she perfect? Without sin or faults? OF COURSE NOT! As nobody is. But the American people are sophisticated enough to see that she captures the morals, the values, the qualities and principled work ethic that represents so many of us. And with every unfair attack the left heaps upon her only strengthens the BASE of support for her, by women and men alike.\n \n Matt Damon gave an interview in which he insulted millions of women and because he's a blind elitist, isn't even aware of how sexist and chauvinistic he is. Here's what he said...\n In an interview with The Associated Press, Damon expressed his concern over putting Palin in the White House because he contends it may not be long before she's the Commander in Chief.\n \n \"I think there's a really good chance Sarah Palin could be president and I think that's a really scary thing,\" Damon said.\n \n In making his assertion, Damon cited the age and health of Palin's running mate, 72-year-old Senator John McCain, who has a history of health issues.\n \n \"There's a one-in-three chance, if not more, that McCain doesn't survive his first term and it will be President Palin,\" the actor continued.\n \n In expressing his concern, Damon likened the scenario to something from the big screen.\n \n \"It's like a really bad Disney movie. The hockey mom... and she's president and facing down [Russian president] Vladimir Putin,\" Damon said. \"It's absurd. It's totally absurd and I don't understand why more people aren't talking about it.\"http://omg.yahoo.com/news/matt-damon-putting-sarah-palin-in-white-house-like-a-really-bad-disney-movie/12957\n \n He doesn't realize as he makes these statements that he is supporting a man for the Presidency who possesses even less real world experience than she does. His statement is just dripping with sexism for that reason, and his attack, and the others that are coming from the left, like Rep Foster saying yesterday that Palins only qualification for the job is that \"she never got an abortion\", is causing women everywhere to support her on principle alone in order to prove them wrong.\n \n Here are a couple of sites that offer some interesting insights into Obama and how he differs from McCain.\n \n http://www.cdobs.com/archive/tags/Obama/\n \n http://riverdaughter.wordpress.com/2008/08/29/obamabiden-palin-comparison/",

Abstinence only allows discussion in absolutely any area that is relevant to the young people in the class, and is age appropriate for the ages of the students in that class. They can ask any questions and discuss any issue, including the use of condoms and birth control which the teacher will answer honestly and openly. They will also discuss the truth about abortions and STDs so the dangers of unprotected sex are known and understood.\n \n Your side attempts to define abstinence as a lecture that demands that the children not have sex or be dammed to hell. It is nothing like that at all, and I think you know that intellectually. It covers the full gambit of questions that are on the minds of the young people, which reflect their age group regarding the level of the questions asked.

   "FWIW, the much touted \"only\" part of the abstinence thing is, in my observation, a relatively rare matter. In my experience, nost people are willing to engage in some form of contraception, even many of the people that liberals label as proponents of this so-called \"abstinence- ONLY.\" It seems to be a given with most people that it's fine (except maybe, among devout Catholics) and this idea the very phrase puts forth that all these schools and families are OPPOSED to contraception is flat-out disingenuous. The more important issue is abstinence, period, and that's generally the matter of focus. I think the real story is that some people really just don't like the idea of teenagers being asked to make abstinence a focus. Probably because it's often religion that asks them to do it. Usually the \"ONLY\" part that opponents are making such an issue of turns out to NOT be someone opposed to contraception, as is the disingenuous implication. The real issue of this movement is that it promotes waiting until marriage to have sex, and that's the bottom line. It's that focus that seems to be what liberals get all in a huff over. And frankly, to take every case where someone slips up and say \"SEE, IT DOESN'T WORK\" pointing at them is just not really an honest approach. It doesn't take into account the scores of people that HAVE waited until they got married, showing that abstinence-only certainly can work.",

   "I have a real problem when kids who are below the age of legal consent to have sex, are exposed to sex education courses like this.\n \n http://www.positive.org/Home/index.html\n \n And this explains what's wrong with it:\n \n http://www.abstinenceassociation.org/newsroom/pr_061307_hhs_report_comprehensive.html\n HHS Report: \"Comprehensive\" Sex Education Ineffective And Offensive\n Programs Instruct Teens As Young As 13 \n on Sexually Explicit Material\n Washington, DC - Parents today learned the truth about so called \"comprehensive\" sex education curricula from a US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) study. The government report reveals how the most commonly used sex education programs have virtually no effect in keeping teens from having sex yet contain numerous sexually explicit lessons taught to teens as young as 13. Of the nine commonly used curricula studied in the HHS report, most showed no impact in preventing teen sex, and one failed to even evaluate program effectiveness. All the programs reviewed by the HHS devoted an overwhelming amount of teaching time to topics such as condom usage, condom demonstration and sexual game play as methods of \"safe\" sex.\n \n \"Although they receive ten times the amount of government money as abstinence programs, so-called 'comprehensive sex education' has not been proven to delay teen sex,\" states Valerie Huber, Executive Director of National Abstinence Education Association (NAEA). \"The predominant message encourages sexual activity. The message of abstinence is virtually non-existent.\"\n \n The HHS study also revealed some startling components of the \"comprehensive\" sex education programs for teens as young as 13 include lessons include:\n \n Advocating showering together as a no risk activity.\n Promoting methods for sexual stimulation.\n Conducting sexual role-play on how to help a partner maintain an erection.\n Describing how to eroticize condom use with a partner.\n Suggesting teens wear shades or a disguises when shopping for condoms so adults and parents won't recognize them.\n Parents communicated their strong support for abstinence education, as currently funded by Congress, in a recent 2007 Zogby poll. In fact, regardless of ideological leaning, parents from across America supported abstinence education over 'comprehensive' sex education by a 2:1 margin. The very topics that parents wanted curricula to cover are absent in most 'comprehensive' sex education.\"",

And kids can access it as easily as adults can. And you can thank the ALA Public and School Libraries\n It is critically important for our children and communities that we free our local libraries from the grip of the American Library Association and make our libraries safe for our children! Make no mistake, the danger to our children is real!\n \n Consider these sobering facts:\n \n A teenager molested a little boy in a library restroom after viewing Internet porn on the library's computer.\n Smut dealers used their local library to run a child pornography ring.\n A report entitled \"Dangerous Access 2000,\" published by the Family Research Council, documents hundreds of incidents of library patrons accessing pornography in public libraries including many involving children.\n ALA refuses to keep porn from kids\n \n But when begged for help to protect children, not only did the American Library Association turn a blind eye and a deaf ear, the organization further demanded that every library in the country provide children with totally unrestricted access to Internet porn! \n \n For example, when asked about \"blocking software\" for library computers so children couldn't access Internet porn, Judith Krug, director of the ALA Office of Intellectual Freedom, said, \"Blocking material leads to censorship. That goes for pornography and bestiality too. If you don't like it, don't look at it.\"\n \n Another ALA spokesman, Richard Matthews, echoed Krug saying, \"We recognize that minors have First Amendment rights, and any attempt to treat them differently from adults really infringes on those rights.\"\n \n ALA influence felt far and wide\n \n And to make things worse, the American Library Association wields significant power in our local libraries, giving it great influence over:\n \n The universities that train librarians.\n Job market requirements for most librarians.\n Sizable portions of state monies for local libraries.\n Major book awards (especially children's). NOTE: The ALA awards both the Newbery and Caldecott Medals for excellence in children's books.\n Training of local library board trustees.\n Lobbying at both state and federal levels on legislation relevant to the ALA's agenda.\n ALA works to undermine protection of kids\n \n Based on their statements and policies about Internet filtering, it's clear that protecting children from harmful material is not part of the ALA's agenda. The sad truth is that unsupervised, curious eyes will seek out the forbidden. That's what children do. And that's why God calls on us, their parents and concerned adults, to protect them. A brief look at the ALA's record is proof:\n \n The ALA played a major role in convincing the Supreme Court to overturn the Communications Decency Act which Congress passed to protect children from Internet pornography. \n The ALA sued to stop the enforcement of a federal law that would withhold federal funds from any library or school that does NOT filter Internet pornography from children.\n Not only does the pornography industry help fund the ALA, but ALA president Ann Symons has served on the Playboy Foundation's awards committee.\n Playboy executive Christie Hefner was a forum panelist at an ALA convention.\n The bottom line always comes down to this official policy statement of the American Library Association: \"Libraries, acting within their mission and objectives, must support access to information on all subjects that serve the needs or interest of each user, regardless of the user's age or the content of the material.\" (See ALA's Article V of the Library Bill of Rights at www.ala.org)\n ",

I also posted a damning story that raised questions about his 1981 trip to 2 cities in Pakistan and India which are known for their radical islamic ties. The question remains as to why he went with a muslim friend? What business did he have there as a student, and a christian? He's not talking about that trip at all. What does he have to hide?

HERE is a link that asks these very valid questions. And THIS very clear concern that Obama has failed to address at all.\n Pakistan was in turmoil in 1981 and ruled of martial law. Millions of Afghan refugees were living in Pakistan, while the Afghan Mujahedeen operated from bases inside Pakistan in their war with the Soviets. One of the leaders that based his operation in Quetta, Pakistan was Usama Bin Laden (The Sheik).\n \n Pakistan was on the banned travel list for US Citizens at the time and all non-Muslim visitors were not welcome unless sponsored by their embassy for official business.\n \n There would be only a few reasons a young Westerner of the Muslim faith would travel to Pakistan in 1981:\n \n To Participate in Jihad, which is the duty of every \"True Believer\".\n \n For religious education in a Wahabbi sect, Saudi funded, Madrassa.\n \n In order to purchase drugs from the drug marketplace.\n \n Pakistan was not a tourist stop nor the place to hang out with someone's family in 1981.\n So how about we quit the denials and just get a straight answer from Obama himself? He has written 2 biographies and yet he has failed to talk about this part of his life. If that trip was such a benefit to his real world foreign policy knowledge, then surely he would want it added to his resume. And yet he hides it.

   "And speaking of pigs with lipstick, here's one from Canada as she labels any Americans who like Sarah Palin as White Trash. HERE She went so far, and her article has received so many complaints that the CBC is reviewing her filthy diatribe. Not that I expect anything to come of that from a literary ghetto like the CBC that rejects anything that doesn't carry the stench of a socialist slant on it. This is just an excerpt from the link.\n The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is reviewing complaints from both Americans and Canadians about a Web site columnist who recently described Sarah Palin's supporters as \"white trash,\" compared the vice presidential candidate to a \"porn actress\" and called her daughter's boyfriend a \"redneck\" and \"ratboy.\"\n \n The incendiary column by Toronto-based writer Heather Mallick appeared on the CBC News site on Sept. 5, after the close of the Republican National Convention. On the same day, Britain's Guardian newspaper published another column by Mallick in which she trashed Palin's home state of Alaska as a \"frontier state full of drunks and crazy people.\"\n \n In the CBC story, Mallick wrote that John McCain's running mate \"added nothing to the ticket that the Republicans didn't already have sewn up, the white trash vote.\"\n \n She proceeded to write that the Alaska governor \"has a toned-down version of the porn actress look favored by this decade's woman, the overtreated hair, puffy lips and permanently alarmed expression.\"\n \n She also questioned why the Palins were allowing Levi Johnston - 17-year-old Bristol Palin's boyfriend and father of her unborn baby - into the family.\n \n \"What normal father would want Levi 'I'm a f--n' redneck' Johnson prodding his daughter?\" Mallick asked.\n \n \"I know that I have an attachment to children that verges on the irrational, but why don't the Palins? I'm not the one preaching homespun values but I'd destroy that ratboy before I'd let him get within scenting range of my daughter again, and so would you. ... Turn your guns on Levi, ma'am.\"\n \n CBC Ombudsman Vince Carlin told FOXNews.com that he has gotten \"quite a few complaints about [the column], both from Canada and the U.S,\" and said he's reviewing its contents to see if it meets CBC's journalistic standards and practices.\n HERE'S her CBC Article",

In simpler terms, so you can get what I'm saying, I proved my assertion with evidence that proves it is true which is something you and chester NEVER EVER DO. You constantly make unsupported claims that you refuse to ever support.\n \n For an example, I'm still waiting for chester the thread molester to show evidence that McCain was ever charged with a crime, or even tried in Court, or convicted of any crime relating to the Keating 5 debacle which he keeps attempting to derail threads with. \n \n You both remind me of the radical islamic terrorists as you drop onto threads, drop your off topic bombs in attempts to derail them, and then crawl back into the cowardly hole you hide in between your unproven and unsupported attacks.",

From obscurity, with zero executive experience, or much of any kind, he has vaulted into the position of Presidential frontrunner. It is stunning. On the surface, it appears attributable only to his eloquent oratory and his race. But an invisible factor may be a strong spiritual force behind him, causing some people to actually swoon in his presence.\n \n I have been very concerned that he has publicly said that he does not believe Jesus is the only way to heaven. This makes both the Bible and Jesus a liar, and it means that Christ has died in vain. A person cannot be a true Christian who believes that there are other ways of forgiveness, salvation, and eternal life with God. Only Jesus has paid the price for that. In one of his speeches he also made fun of some of the scriptures from OUR Bible.\n \n Therefore, there is, indeed, another spirit involved. And this spirit has come into our national life like a flood. Last week at Obama's acceptance speech, that spirit exalted itself in front of a Greek temple-like stage, and to a huge audience like in a Roman arena. Obama was portrayed as god-like. His voice thundered as a god's voice.\n \n At the end, Democratic sympathizer Pastor Joel Hunter gave the benediction and shockingly invited everyone to close the prayer to their own (false) gods. This was surely an abomination, but it was compatible with Obama's expressed theology, and Hunter's leftist leanings.\n \n God was not pleased.\n \n And God says, 'When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.' (Isaiah 59:19)\n \n Enter Governor Sarah Palin. With incredible timing, the very next day, Sarah Palin also appeared out of nowhere. Her shocking selection as John McCain's running mate stunned the world and suddenly took all the wind out of Obama's sails.\n \n We quickly learned that Sar ah is a born-again, Spirit-filled Christian, attends church, and has been a ministry worker.\n \n Sarah is that standard God has raised up to stop the flood. She has the anointing. You can tell by how the dogs are already viciously attacking her. But they will not be successful. She knows the One she serves and will not be intimidated.\n \n Back in the 1980s, I sensed that Israel's little-known Benjamin Netanyahu was chosen by God for an important end-time role. I still believe that. I now have that same sense about Sarah Palin.\n \n Today I did some checking and discovered that both her first and last names are biblical words, one in Hebrew the other in Greek:\n \n Sarah. Wife of Abraham and mother of Isaac. In Hebrew, Sarah means 'noble woman' (Strong's 8283).\n \n Palin. In Greek, the word means 'renewal.' (Strong's 3825).\n \n Only God knows the future an d how she may be used by Him, but may this noble woman serve to bring renewal in the land, and inspiration.\n \n  Scratch a rightie, find a hater every time.",

This was surely an abomination, but it was compatible with Obama's expressed theology, and Hunter's leftist leanings.\n \n God was not pleased.\n \n And God says, 'When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.' (Isaiah 59:19)\n \n Enter Governor Sarah Palin. With incredible timing, the very next day, Sarah Palin also appeared out of nowhere. Her shocking selection as John McCain's running mate stunned the world and suddenly took all the wind out of Obama's sails.\n \n We quickly learned that Sar ah is a born-again, Spirit-filled Christian, attends church, and has been a ministry worker.\n \n Sarah is that standard God has raised up to stop the flood. She has the anointing. You can tell by how the dogs are already viciously attacking her. But they will not be successful. She knows the One she serves and will not be intimidated.\n \n Back in the 1980s, I sensed that Israel's little-known Benjamin Netanyahu was chosen by God for an important end-time role. I still believe that. I now have that same sense about Sarah Palin.\n \n Today I did some checking and discovered that both her first and last names are biblical words, one in Hebrew the other in Greek:\n \n Sarah. Wife of Abraham and mother of Isaac. In Hebrew, Sarah means 'noble woman' (Strong's 8283).\n \n Palin. In Greek, the word means 'renewal.' (Strong's 3825).\n \n Only God knows the future an d how she may be used by Him, but may this noble woman serve to bring renewal in the land, and inspiration.\n \n  Scratch a leftie, find a hater every time.\n\n \n Corrected for truth. It is Liberals who are the most intolerant peole on the fact of the Earth.",
