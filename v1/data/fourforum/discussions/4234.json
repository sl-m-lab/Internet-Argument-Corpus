The research is to understand, who becomes a Creationist, why, where your from etc. Your help is most appreciated.\n \n Please give basic background:\n Age, State of residence, Marital status, Education Level, Religious Affiliation, Occupation.\n \n What type of Creationist are you? Examples:\n \n Flat Earthers - believe that the earth is flat and is covered by a solid dome or firmament. Waters above the firmament were the source of Noah's flood. This belief is based on a literal reading of the Bible, such as references to the \"four corners of the earth\" and the \"circle of the earth.\" Few people hold this extreme view, but some do.\n \n Geocentrism - accept a spherical earth but deny that the sun is the center of the solar system or that the earth moves. As with flat-earth views, the water of Noah's flood came from above a solid firmament. The basis for their belief is a literal reading of the Bible. \"It is not an interpretation at all, it is what the words say.\" (Willis 2000) Both flat-earthers and geocentrists reflect the cosmological views of ancient Hebrews. Geocentrism is not common today, but one geocentrist (Tom Willis) was intrumental in revising the Kansas elementary school curriculum to remove references to evolution, earth history, and science methodology.\n \n Young Earth Creationists - claim a literal interpretation of the Bible as a basis for their beliefs. They believe that the earth is 6000 to 10,000 years old, that all life was created in six literal days, that death and decay came as a result of Adam & Eve's Fall, and that geology must be interpreted in terms of Noah's Flood. However, they accept a spherical earth and heliocentric solar system. \n \n Old-Earth Creationists - accept the evidence for an ancient earth but still believe that life was specially created by God, and they still base their beliefs on the Bible. There are a few different ways of accomodating their religion with science.\n \n Day-age creationists - interpret each day of creation as a long period of time, even thousands or millions of years. They see a parallel between the order of events presented in Genesis 1 and the order accepted by mainstream science. Day-Age Creationism was more popular than Gap Creationism in the 19th and and early 20th centuries.\n \n Evolutionary Creationism - differs from Theistic Evolution only in its theology, not in its science. It says that God operates not in the gaps, but that nature has no existence independent of His will. It allows interpretations consistent with both a literal Genesis and objective science, allowing, for example, that the events of creation occurred, but not in time as we know it, and that Adam was not the first biological human but the first spiritually aware one.\n \n Theistic Evolution - says that God creates through evolution. Theistic Evolutionists vary in beliefs about how much God intervenes in the process. It accepts most or all of modern science, but it invokes God for some things outside the realm of science, such as the creation of the human soul. This position is promoted by the Pope and taught at mainline Protestant seminaries.\n \n Vedic Creationism\n Hinduism speaks of a very ancient earth. One book influenced by Hindu belief argues that anatomically modern humans have existed for billions of years.\n \n Finally, What brought you to believe what you believe?\n \n Your help is most appreciated.",

   "Hi, Captruss. \n \n \n I have a idea. How about reading all of the 217 posts below in the atheist vs. creationist thread , and see if you can come up with a definitive answer on your own, as to why people believe one way or the other ? After you have read all of those, I believe you may change your research subject :) If you base your research paper on statistics which MAY or MAY not, prove why a person believes in creation or evolution based on their marital status,age, geographical location, educational level, hmmmm, by the time the paper is done, you may be on social security pension (if there still is one in 2050) before its ready to be turned in to the professor . good luck on your paper :)",

The research is to understand, who becomes a Creationist, why, where your from etc. Your help is most appreciated.\n\n \n An interesting topic. \n \n Although I'm not a creationist, I've debated several hundred young earth creationists (YECs) over many years across various Internet fora, as well as 'in the flesh'. My observations concerning these individuals are my own, and I do not present them as being statistically valid. That said, I offer you my observations...\n [*]Almost all YECs are Christian fundamentalists with the exception of a handful of fundamentalist Muslims and Jews.[*]YEC is essentially an American phenomenon with small enclaves in Canada and Australia. [*]YEC emerged in the late 1890s in response to what some saw as a threat to biblical inerrancy posed by Darwinism as well as the Documentary Hypothesis of the Torah.[*]YEC is based upon the belief that the Bible is literally true and correct in all aspects.[*]Accordingly, the earth and universe were created circa six thousand years ago, Adam & Eve existed, and the earth was subjected to a global flood.[*]YEC has been forced to manufacture its own science, its own history, its own biblical scholarship, and its own archaeology, claiming that the secular versions of these disciplines have yet to 'catch up' with the Bible. For examples, I offer you the \"Answers in Genesis\", \"TrueOrigins\", and \"Institute for Creation Research\" websites. [*]Given that the Bible mentions demonic possession, YEC has no choice but to accept it as fact.[*]It would be a mistake to characterize YECs as ignorant. I once had an extended email exchange with a YEC by the name of Danny Faulkner who taught physics/astronomy at the University of South Carolina. [*]My overall impression is that many of these folks are caught in a trap of their own making. They are desperate to defend the literal truth of the Bible, fearing that if even one aspect of the Bible is wrong, the entire text becomes suspect. ",

   "On the other hand you have the Darwinists, anti-creationists, etc., who one could also say manufacture their own brand of science, injecting inference where none is warranted or substantiated. Some of them believe that a whole universe can spring from nothing (I think it's obvious that the universe can not be responsible for its own creation)., that life magically appeared out of swamp slime, etc. In order to believe in evolution, people have to swallow whole the unlikely concept of abiogenesis / spontaneous generation - the highly improbable and scientifically unexplainable precept that living organisms suddenly came to life in the midst of a primordial organic \"soup.\" Dr. George Wald, a Nobel Prize-winning laureate from Harvard University, had this to say concerning spontaneous generation: \"One has only to contemplate the magnitude of this task to concede that the spontaneous generation of a living organism is impossible. Yet here we are - as a result, I believe, of spontaneous generation\" (Scientific American, August, 1954). That kind of a statement surely demonstrates a much greater faith than a religious creationist can possibly muster. Dr. Wald categorically states that it could not possibly have happened - yet he believes it did. A Christian who professes to so great a faith would be labeled as naive and gullible. What a difference a cloak of higher education makes to those who are so easily impressed!\n \n Then there's the transitional fossil record which even many evolutionists disagree on. To begin with, S. M. Stanley of Johns Hopkins University tells us how important the transitional fossil record is to the theory of evolution: \"It is doubtful whether, in the absence of (transitional) fossils, the idea of evolution would represent anything more than an outrageous hypothesis....the fossil record and only the fossil record provides direct evidence of major sequential changes...\" (Evolutionary Timetable, 1981, page 72.). Now regarding whether or not these transitional fossils exist, Colin Patterson, Senior Paleontologist for the British Museum of Natural History remarks, \"You say I should at least show a photo of a fossil from which each type of organism was derived. I will lay it on the line - there is not one such fossil for which we can make a watertight argument\" (Harper's, Feb. 1984, page 56). Niles Elidridge of Columbia University and a former paleontologist with the American Museum of Natural History categorically states, \"Darwin prophesied that future generations of paleontologists would fill in these (transitional fossil) gaps by diligent research....One hundred and twenty years of paleontological research later, it has become abundantly clear that the fossil record will not confirm this part of Darwin's predictions....The fossil record simply shows that this prediction was wrong\" (The Myths of Human Evolution, pages 45-46). Professor D. B. Kitts from the University of Oklahoma echoes what Elidredge said when he states, \"Despite the bright promise that paleontology provides a means of 'seeing' evolution, it has presented some rather nasty difficulties for evolutionists, the most notorious of which is the presence of 'gaps' in the fossil record. Evolution requires intermediate forms between species, and paleontology does not provide them\" (Evolution, Vol. 28, page 467). They shouldn't confuse macro evolution with micro evolution. And so it goes....",

   "Along with all that, many of the top evolutionary scientists have summarily given up on supporting the theory of evolution by virtue of the transitional fossil record, and they have graduated to new models of evolution known as \"Punctuated Equilibrium\" or \"Special Creation,\" which may not require transitional fossils as supporting evidence. To this, Colin Patterson of the British Museum of Natural History concludes, \"Well, it seems to me that they have accepted that the fossil record doesn't give them the support they would value so they had to search around for another model....When they haven't got the evidence they need to support their theory, they come up with another theory to explain their lack of evidence\" (Quoted in Darwin's Enigma, p. 100). \n \n Then on to the next \"problem child\" of evolution - \"Natural Selection\" - as a means of generating new species. The assumption of Natural Selection is that since only the strongest and \"most fit\" species survive to father the next generation, the species will gradually improve, even to the point of advancing into other more \"highly\" developed states on the evolutionary scale. Darwin looked upon natural selection as the most important factor in the development of his theory. Another evolutionist by the name of Sir Julian Huxley said, \"So far as we know....natural selection is the only effective agency of evolution\" (Evolution in Action, p. 36). Huxley goes on to state, \"On the basis of our present knowledge natural selection is bound to produce genetic adaptations; and genetic adaptations are thus presumptive evidence for the efficacy of natural selection.\" Did you catch that gem of twisted logic? Huxley's proof for natural selection is genetic adaptations within the species, but these genetic adaptations are at the same time the result of natural selection. So which is it? Does natural selection give rise to genetic adaptation, or does genetic adaptation give rise to natural selection? Huxley contends that both of these things are true at the same time! Surely this is one of the most vacuous examples of circular reasoning to ever be perpetrated in the name of science. Huxley continues with his defense of natural selection by saying, \"....(natural selection) operates with the aid of time to produce improvements in the machinery of life, and in the process generates results of a more than astronomical improbability which could have been achieved in no other way\" (Evolution in Action, p. 54-55). Don't miss the force of that last statement. Huxley states that the odds of natural selection occurring are \"astronomically improbable,\" but because Huxley sees no other way for it to have occurred, he believes in the astronomically improbable! Huxley even calculated the odds of natural selection occurring in nature as 1 over 10 followed by three million zeros (\"Evolution in Action,\" page 46). Now listen to what another evolutionist says regarding natural selection: Dr. Ernst Mayr, considered to be one of the heavyweights in the field of evolution, contends that, \"Natural Selection is no longer regarded as an all-or-none process, but rather as a purely statistical concept\" (Animal Species, p. 7). It is statistical because there is a lack of physical evidence to support it! And G. G. Simpson, another highly regarded interpreter of evolutionary theory, remarks, \"It might be argued that the theory is quite unsubstantiated and has status only as a speculation\" (Major Features, p. 118-119). Natural selection may indeed produce stronger and more viable species, but they always remain the same species.",

   "Finally, on to genetic mutations - Professor Ernst Mayr stated, \"(Genetic) mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation found in natural populations, and the only raw material for natural selection to work on\" (Evolution, p. 170). Well, to begin with, virtually all scientists agree that genetic mutations are very rare. Secondly, when they do occur, they are almost certain to be harmful or deadly to the organism. Huxley admits that, \"The great majority of mutant genes are harmful in their effect on the organism.\" Other scientists, including Darwin himself, conceded that most mutants are recessive and degenerative - they would therefore be more likely to cause the death or extinction of the species than to cause the emergence of a new species. Professor G.G. Simpson, one of the top spokesmen for evolution, reports that the mathematical likelihood of getting good evolutionary results through mutations would only tend to occur once every 274 billion years. And that would be assuming 100 million individuals reproducing a new generation every day. Simpson concludes by saying that, \"Obviously...such a process has played no part whatever in evolution\" (The Major Features of Evolution, p. 96). Evolutionists say that genetic mutations are necessary to make the changes required by their theory, yet when they do the calculations they confess that it is scientifically improbable for multiple mutations to effect the required changes that are needed. \n \n So what we've seen in the last few posts is that there is a highly charged debate going on between evolutionists which pose serious problems in their own community and with their own theories.",

   "epaphras faith,\n \n You know, an English preacher by the name of Smith Wigglesworth once said, \"If you leave people as you found them, God is not speaking through you. If you are not making people either mad or glad, there is something wrong with your ministry. If there's not a war going on, you're not doing your job.\"\n \n Another commentator, a guy by the name of Arthur Wallis, speaking on the Apostolic style of preaching that we see in the Book of Acts, said, \"Such preaching makes indifference to the word of God impossible - it sets the hearers into one of two camps. It's calculated to either produce a revival or a riot.\"\n \n Whether we like it or not, God's people are sometimes called on to \"rock the boat.\" We are not called out to appease a lost and sinful society, but to give them the Word of God. You have to remember that, generally speaking, the world hated Jesus. He often made people feel uncomfortable. Like the prophets before him, He exposed sin and rebuked unrighteousness. He wouldn't compromise the word of God to make friends with the world. He was looked upon as a radical; he was accused of having demons, and he was rejected by his own people and nailed to the cross. \n \n Why didn't the world receive Jesus? Because he often preached a confrontational message. And what is a confrontational message? It's a message that preaches Jesus Christ, exposes sin, superficial faith, and lets people know that unless they have Christ as their savior they're lost. It's a message that in many ways is in conflict with worldly thinking.\n \n Now, how many times have we prayed for the Holy Spirit to bring conviction into the hearts of the people? You want to know something very fundamental? Unless the Holy Spirit brings people into conviction for the things they've done in their lives, they will have absolutely no reason to think that they need a savior. Without conviction of sin there is no conversion, and without conversion the cross of Christ makes no sense at all. \n \n Why was John the Baptist beheaded? Was he a reed swayed by the breeze of political correctness? Was John one of those guys who wanted everyone to be his buddy? Was he someone who sought after his own well being and personal enhancement? John the Baptist spoke out strongly against the corrupt pharisees and leaders of his day. He went after King Herod and reminded him he was living in sin for taking his brother's wife and making her his own. He wasn't playing the world's game and looking out for his own welfare. He was preaching the word of God, trying to turn someone to repentance and salvation, and for that he was labeled a troublemaker and eventually put to death. Why was Paul persecuted? Why was James put to death with the sword? Why were the prophets and the apostles martyred? They preached the word of God and gospel of Jesus Christ, including heaven and hell. And Noah preached for some eighty years, but only eight people got on that ark. They were God's little troublemakers, so to speak. At least that's the way the world looked at them.\n \n So if I rebuked two people in this forum - Trebor and Orion - both of whom have a clear, anti-Christian agenda replete with personal attacks, don't think I like it or that's what I'm all about. Nor am I self-righteous, for Christ is my Savior for the remission of my sins. The self-righteous ones are those who think they don't need Christ. Like I said before, some people come to Christ out of love and some come to him rebuked and fearful of going to hell. You and I are not privy to knowing which is which, so you do it your way and I'll do it my way. And if telling people about hell is offensive, so be it. In the meantime, I commend your faith in Christ and look forward to watching you win souls and defend the Word of God your way.",

   "You leave out WHO it was that was rebuked. Jesus did not rebuke the woman at the well, he told her the truth and had mercy on her. He did not rebuke the woman caught in adultery, nor the tax gatherers, nor any of the \"sinners\" of that society. He rebuked those that preached a God that was not true to the nature of the God. \"Woe to you Pharisees and keepers of the law....\"You best take a look at WHO!\n\n \n In all fairness you may be forgetting some. Did Jesus not rebuke Peter? Did he not rebuke regular (non-pharisee) Jews in John 8:31-47, telling them they were of their father the devil for not believing him? Did he not rebuke even the churches in Revelation chapters 2 and 3? Did he not say that he would cast Jezebel on a bed of suffering for her immorality in Revelation 2:21-22? Did Jesus not tell people in the Gospel of John that unless they believed he was who he claimed to be that \"you will indeed die in your sins\"? How about Paul? Didn't he say, \"Expel the wicked man from amongst you\"? Did the prophets not rebuke the sinful people of Israel when they were bad? Did Nathan not confront David for his murder and adultery? I could probably get you dozens of more examples from both the Old and New Testaments of similar occurrences. Such examples were not part of your statement to me above, though I do understand the greater part of what you were trying to say. \n \n There was once this one guy (true story) who, with his wife, heard a blazing sermon on hell, and didn't go up to the altar to receive Christ afterwards. The next week he heard a different preacher give a similar sermon, after which he went and confessed Christ. His wife asked him why he didn't do that the previous week. He said (paraphrasing), \"I knew what the first preacher was saying was right, but I didn't like his delivery or tone.\" The point is that the seed was planted the week before. So maybe I can be the \"villian\" here and you can be the \"clean-up man\". You never know what's going to take or how long, and it may take months or even years. God bless!",

Fear is not a very good motivator. Never has been.\n\n \n That's hogwash, Orion. Professional athletes talk about their fear of failing all the time. Fear of imprisonment keeps one heck of a lot of people out of jail. Capital punishment is designed not only for purposes of establishing justice but also as a motivator to keep people from committing murder, etc. That's one of the reasons why violating various laws have negative consequences attached to them by legislators. \n \n \nI don't know about you, but my father never caused me to fear him.\n\n \n What's that old saying? Spare the rod and spoil the child? What do mothers say sometimes? \"If you do that I'm going to tell your father and you can deal with him when he gets home\"!! But maybe your dad let you run wild, I don't know, but most kids I grew up with had a healthy fear of not wanting to get crossways with their dads, with the school principal, etc. \n \n As for hell-fire sermons, not only do they often work (depending on the preacher, the material, and the individuals in attendance) but good preachers know this, which is why they often employ them in the pulpit. Such was the case with Jonathan Edward's \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\", which helped fuel a great revival in America.",

My guess is you cannot.\n \n Lastly, looking at your website only proves my point:\n \n The Lord is...not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. (II Peter 3:9) \n \n Matthew 10:28, And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him  which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. \n \n Luke 12:5, But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which AFTER he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him\n \n Please note that the idea is to FEAR GOD not hell. The remainder of scripture only points to the existence of Hell which I admit. However, nothing, but nothing says that we are to scare people with it. Rather we are to declare the riches and mercy and grace that are in the hands of the Father. \"it is His kindness that leads us to repentance.\"\n \n \"My Grace is sufficient for you\", \"For by Grace you are saved through faith and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God that no man may boast,\" I will take from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh\", \n \n Luke 24:47\n and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. (Note it does not say hell shall be preached)\n \n Romans 2:4\n Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness leads you toward repentance? \n \n 2 Corinthians 7:10\n Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death. (Note the differentiation here.) Godly sorrow does not come from fear but sadness out of what I have done. Worldly sorrow says I am afraid of what will happen to me.)\n \n 2 Timothy 2:25\n Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, \n (Gently Instruct, not try to scare the wits out of)\n \n The above references are from the NIV.

Many people I have talked with over the years in the forums have come to know you as an anti-Christian bigot because of your constant ill-conceived and sometimes vicious attacks on God's Word, Christ, the Virgin Mary, God's plan of Salvation, etc. You even encourage people who practice Wiccanism, paganism, hedonism, and many other ungodly pursuits, paving the path to perdition for them. And all that wouldn't be so bad but you STILL do not have the wherewithall or ability to credibly present and support your own illogical, \"all-paths-lead-to-God\" liberal mantra. And what's so hilarious is that your \"all-paths-lead-to-God\" mantra excludes the traditional Biblical plan of salvation through Jesus Christ only! So take a nap and come back when you can do something other than bash Jesus Christ and his people.\n\n \n EZ, your comments are not worthy of a response. Suffice it to say that you are once again attempting to divert attention away from yourself and from criticisms which have been brought against you, however benign and constructive those criticisms may be, by others, including your own fellow Christians both here and elsewhere.",

So take a nap and come back when you can do something other than bash Jesus Christ and his people.\n\n \n Orion and I do not agree on much. However, Orion was simply arguing the statement that you made saying you only occasionally \"warn\" of hell. He pointed out many statements to show the contrary. He also attacked you personally, trying to explain that he has seen this pattern repeatedly. You, however, have resulted to ad hominem argumentation, pointing out that because he is the way he is that is why he argues what he does. \n \n I am a devout christian. I love Christ and know well my destination. I love orion (in a christian way) and have a desire that he may know the real jesus. Then his mocking will stop. My telling him he will go to hell will do nothing.\n \n Did the jews turn from God when Jeremiah warned them of the coming judgement. Did they turn from their ways BEFORE the serpent was sent to them in the wilderness, God lived in the tent among them. The focus should be on God. \"Seek First the kingdom of Heaven and His righteousness and all else shall be added.\"\n \n I am sorry you would resort to this blatant attack with no attempt at argumentation.",

True evangelism is living in the open with others. If you see something in me that is impressive then so be it. (I frankly doubt you will) It is not my primary purpose. I am here to grow and learn like anyone else. Do I hope some may come to christ as a result of our learning together? You bet. Why wouldn't I if I truly believed Christ to be the only real life to have? If I believe it to be the best thing, I do hope and pray some come to christ because of our discussions. But, it is not my goal. My goal, is to test and strengthen my own faith. Faith under fire is the only way it grows stronger. \n \n I have been tested, logically and otherwise, in these many discussions. I have posted over 2000 times and have enjoyed most of them. There are many here who do not believe as I do that I respect greatly. I think EZ's intent really is to \"warn people about hell\". I am firmly of the belief that only takes people's eyes off of a good and loving father. Evangelism is a word that comes from \"Euangelion.\" It is a greek word that means \"Good News\". The Good news is not that you can be saved from Hell. The good news is that we have been given true life. That is my belief, my goal and my life.\n \n What you choose is up to you. Jesus died to give everyman the choice. I will not subvert that act.\n \n EF",

From reading your previous posts I get the impression that you, as is the case with many of us, are here to both share and to learn, and I think that is the best possible use that we can make of a forum such as this.\n \n I'm a student of comparative religion, and I have spent considerable effort within the last twenty years or so in attempting to come to an understanding of the world's major (and more than a few minor) religions. I consider it to be a fascinating subject and I love to discuss it. Problem is, religion, much as with politics, is a hot-button issue, and some people are only too eager to evangelize at these fora. Such efforts are tolerable, but they're also quite annoying, especially when the evangelist attempts to push the hard sell. Such efforts, in my opinion, are a definite turn-off as well as being self-defeating.\n \n In any case, I look forward to having discussions with you. Perhaps we can learn from each other.",
