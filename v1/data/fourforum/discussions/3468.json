   "Subject: Fwd:Don't close the blinds\n \n This is an amazing analogy, and really is a great way to explain the world's situation to kids (if they ask) and to adults when they just don't understand why we do what we do as military members sent to defend our country while on foreign soil. \n \n \n Don't Close Your Blinds \n \n The other day, my nine year old son wanted to know why we were at war. My husband looked at our son and then looked at me. My husband and I were in the Army during the Gulf War and we would be honored to serve and defend our Country again today. I knew that my husband would give him a good explanation. \n \n My husband thought for a few minutes and then told my son to go stand in our front living room window. He told him: \"Son, stand there and tell me what you see?\" \n \n \"I see trees and cars and our neighbor's houses.\" he replied. \n \n \"OK, now I want you to pretend that our house and our yard is the United States of America and you are President Bush.\" \n \n Our son giggled and said \"OK.\" \n \n \"Now son, I want you to look out the window and pretend that every house and yard on this block is a different country\" my husband said. \n \n \"OK Dad, I'm pretending.\" \n \n \"Now I want you to stand there and look out the window and see that man come out of his house with his wife and he has her by the hair and is hitting her. You see her bleeding and crying. He hits her in the face, he throws her on the ground, then he starts to kick her to death. Their children run out and are afraid to stop him, they are crying, they are watching this but do nothing because they are kids and afraid of their father. You see all of this son.... what do you do?\" \n \n \"Dad?\" \n \n \"What do you do son?\" \n \n \"I call the police, Dad.\" \n \n \"OK. Pretend that the police are the United Nations and they take your call, listen to what you know and saw but they refuse to help. What do you do then son?\" \n \n \"Dad, but the police are supposed to help!\" My son starts to whine. \n \n \"They don't want to son, because they say that it is not their place or your place to get involved and that you should stay out of it,\" my husband says \n \n \"But Dad..he killed her!!\" my son exclaims. \n \n \"I know he did...but the police tell you to stay out of it. Now I want you to look out that window and pretend you see our neighbor who you're pretending is Saddam turn around and do the same thing to his children.\" \n \n \"Daddy...he kills them?\" \n \n \"Yes son, he does. What do you do?\" \n \n \"Well, if the police don't want to help, I will go and ask my next door neighbor to help me stop him.\" our son says. \n \n \"Son, our next door neighbor sees what is happening and refuses to get involved as well. He refuses to open the door and help you stop him,\" my husband says. \n \n \"But Dad, I NEED help!!! I can't stop him by myself!!\" \n \n \"WHAT DO YOU DO SON?\" Our son starts to cry. \n \n \"OK, no one wants to help you, the man across the street saw you ask for help and saw that no one would help you stop him. He stands taller and puffs out his chest. Guess what he does next son?\" \"What Daddy?\" \n \n \"He walks across the street to the old ladies house and breaks down her door and drags her out, steals all her stuff and sets her house on fire and then...he kills her. He turns around and sees you standing in the window and laughs at you. WHAT DO YOU DO?\" \n \n \"Daddy...\" \n \n \"WHAT DO YOU DO?\" \n \n Our son is crying and he looks down and he whispers, \"I close the blinds, Daddy.\" \n \n My husband looks at our son with tears in his eyes and asks him... \"Why?\" \n \n \"Because Daddy.....the police are supposed to help...people who needs it...and they won't help....You always say that neighbors are supposed to HELP neighbors, but they won't help either...they won't help me stop him...I'm afraid....I can't do it by myself ...Daddy.....I can't look out my window and just watch him do all these terrible things and...and.....do nothing...so....I'm just going to close the blinds....so I can't see what he's doing........and I'm going to pretend that it is not happening.\" \n \n I start to cry. \n \n My husband looks at our nine year old son standing in the window, looking pitiful and ashamed at his answers to my husbands questions and he tells him..\"Son\" \n \n \"Yes, Daddy.\" \n \n \"Open the blinds because that man.... he's at your front door..\"WHAT DO YOU DO?\" \n \n My son looks at his father, anger and defiance in his eyes. He balls up his tiny fists and looks his father square in the eyes, without hesitation he says: \"I DEFEND MY FAMILY DAD!! I'M NOT GONNA LET HIM HURT MOMMY OR MY SISTER, DAD!!! I'M GONNA FIGHT HIM, DAD, I'M GONNA FIGHT HIM!!!!!\" \n \n I see a tear roll down my husband's cheek and he grabs my son to his chest and hugs him tight, and cries...\"It's too late to fight him, he's too strong and he's already at YOUR front door son.....you should have stopped him BEFORE he killed his wife You have to do what's right, even if you have to do it alone, before....it's too late.\" my husband whispers. \n \n THAT scenario I just gave you is WHY we are at war with Iraq. When good men stand by and let evil happen is the greatest EVIL of all. Our President is doing what is right. We, as a free nation, must understand that this war is a war of humanity. WE must remove evil men from power so that we can continue to live in a free world where we are not afraid to look out our window. So that my nine year old son won't grow up in a world where he feels that if he just \"closes\" that blinds the atrocities in the world won't affect him. \"YOU MUST NEVER BE AFRAID TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT! EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO DO IT ALONE!\" \n \n BE PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN! \n BE PROUD OF OUR TROOPS!! \n SUPPORT THEM!!! \n SUPPORT AMERICA!! \n \n SO THAT IN THE FUTURE OUR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE TO CLOSE THEIR BLINDS...\"",

   "Well, one of my pet peeves is when people use bad anologies to make a point.\n \n The analogy would have been better IF the saddam neighbor had a few hundred people living in his house, not all from his family. \n \n Then the saddam neighbor has to have a fued with another neighbor for 10 years. \n \n The fued is eventually over.\n \n Then out of the blue he breaks into another neighbor's house overnight, and the \"police\" come and stop him and put him in \"jail\" (containment) along with all the people living at his house.\n \n While in jail, he kills a few of the people that were living in his house (and are now in jail with him) because they wanted him to move out. The police (UN-US) just watch through the window while he does this.\n \n Then, while in jail, he holds his hands behind his back and the guards (UN) ask him what he's got.\n \"Nothin,\" he keeps repeating but he won't show the guards what's in his hands.\n The guards don't believe him and start struggling to get his hands from behind his back. \n While this is going on, one of the guards (Bush) starts beating the other people from his house that are in jail with him. \n A few of them die because of it.\n While that is going on the other guards rush out of the cell and say, \"That guard is wreckless and crazy!\"\n Then the bush guard beats the saddam neighbor until he opens his hands, which are empty.\n The other people in the cell get angry and start to fight back against the guard.\n The guard tries to escape the cell but he can't get out (and that's where we are now).\n \n .",

   "This first one was a horrible analogy as mentioned here earlier. First of all it isn't just a kid it's one of the strongest armies in the world. Then you have to say that the police are actually searching the house and have him contained in a corner of the room where he isn't beating his wife anymore. Then Bush (the kid who had all the power because he was a big military) would have to tell the police to get out he's going to kill that SOB because he has a knife hidden in the house somewhere. He order's Saddam to tell him where it is, arrests Saddam, can't find the knife. Then he says the reason we're in the neighbor's house is because he was beating his wife.",
