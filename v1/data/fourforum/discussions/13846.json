Tiller:\n \nDuring closing arguments on Friday morning, Mr. Roeder sat silent and expressionless as prosecutors portrayed the shooting of Dr. Tiller at his church on May 31 as not just premeditated murder but as \"a planned assassination\" that had been proven \"not only beyond a reasonable doubt but beyond any doubt.\"\n \n \"He claims justification,\" Kim Parker, a prosecutor said, calling on jurors here to uphold the law, not Mr. Roeder's views of abortion, which, she said, he had proudly trumpeted on the witness stand. \"These are not the acts of a justified man. These acts are cowardly.\" \n \n .... Yes, he bought a gun. Yes, he took target practice. Yes, he had learned about Dr. Tiller's habits, his home address, his security precautions. And, yes, he shot Dr. Tiller last May 31 as Dr. Tiller stood inside his church.\n \n \"That is correct, yes,\" Mr. Roeder told the jurors, in a calm.\n\n Jury Reaches Guilty Verdict in Murder of Abortion Doctor - NYTimes.com\n \n We, and the law, must stand firm against terrorists like Scott Roeder.",

   " \n \n No you said ripping them from the womb minutes before they were born. That isn't late term that is birth. You know perfectly well nobody is intentionally and legally having an abortion during contractions. The exact quote is below. \n\n Since you, apparently, aren't familiar with late term abortion procedures, here it is:\n \n\n The procedure is usually performed during the fifth month of gestation or later. The woman's cervix is dilated, and the fetus is partially removed from the womb, feet first. The surgeon inserts a sharp object into the back of the fetus' head, removes it, and inserts a vacuum tube through which the brains are extracted. The head of the fetus contracts at this point and allows the fetus to be more easily removed from the womb. \n D&X procedure (a.k.a.Partial Birth Abortion) - All sides \n\n Note: the woman's cervix is dilated. That is accomplished by inducing labor. When you induce labor, contractions result. Also note that the \"fetus is partially-removed from the womb\". The fetus is typically turned around so that it would exit feet first because once the head is exposed, it is considered murder to kill the infant. But, as long as the head isn't delivered before you kill the infant, it's legal. Nice huh?\n \n\n Why are you defending this to this extent. You said it and it was. You could have played it off and moved on. Instead you want to get sarcastic about telling me blue is really orange. You have made it a bigger deal than it was.\n \n\n See above. That's why. Now, I understand that this barbaric practice isn't representative of the mainstream of abortions, but it does demonstrate the lengths that pro-abortionist will go to retain \"choice\". It's a totally morally-bankrupt position, IMO.\n \n\n You make no sense and this is a pretty weak attempt on your part. OK your right I'll be a drama queen, do you feel ok now? Were you able to man up with that one? Wanna maybe move on?\n \n Where are you taking this? Read what I posted in the context of the post, not some desperate attempt to save your wounded pride.\n \n How can you make a decent presentation sometimes and then come back with this?\n\n Because of the poor use of quotes, I'm clueless as to what you're trying to say here.

I apologize for not explaining it clearly enough. In the \"state of nature\", an individual's actions are bound only by his or her personal power and constrained by conscience. From this common starting point, Hobbes explains why it is in an individual's rational self-interest to voluntarily give up the freedom one has in the \"state of nature\" in order to obtain the benefits of political order.\n \n To more directly address this point: If the police did not exist, you would have to kill people to survive. Sadists, hotheads, and other natural-born killers are part of the problem, not just because of the harm they wreak but because of the aggressive posture they force others into for deterrence and self-defense. Without the justice system acting in our stead, exacting revenge for wrongs done to us would be a risky business. If an adversary were dangerous enough to have hurt you in the first place, he is not likely to take punishment lying down. Since the damage has already been done, a coolly rational victim may not see it in his interests to retaliate. And since the aggressor can anticipate this, he could call the victim's bluff and abuse him with impunity. If, on the other hand, potential victims and their kin would be so consumed with the lust for retribution as to raise a son to avenge a slain father, drink the kinsman's blood as a covenant, and so on, aggressors might think twice before aggressing.\n \n If you think the Hobbesian perspective and the pitfalls (see: Hobbesian Trap) are merely philosophical hypotheticals, consider the Yanomamo villages who obsess over the danger of being massacred by other villages (with good reason). They engage in pre-emptives strikes to remove these threats, which encourage other villages to engage in pre-emptive strikes, which prompt groups of villages to form alliances that make their neighbors even more nervous. Street gangs and Mafia families engage in similar machinations. \n \n \n\n We do not delegate the right to harm or kill anyone we want to the government, we don't have that right and no one ever has had it regardless of what military power they posses.\n\n \n Hobbes's analysis of the causes of violence, borne out by modern data on crime and war, shows that violence is not a primitive, irrational urge. Instead, it is a near-inevitable outcome of the dynamics of self-interested, rational social organisms.\n \n Consider Oct 17, 1969 in Montreal. At 8:00 am, the police went on strike. By 11:20 am, the first bank was robbed. By noon most downtown stores had closed because of looting. Within a few more hours, taxi drivers burned down the garage of a limousine service that had competed with them for airport customers, a rooftop sniper killed a provincial police officer, rioters broke into several hotels and restaurants, and a doctor slew a burglar in his suburban home. By the end of the day, six banks had been robbed, a hundred shops had been looted, twelve fires had been set, forty carloads of storefront glass had been broken, and three million dollars in property damage had been inflicted before the city authorities had to call in the army.\n \n The generalization that lack of government leads to violent chaos may seem banal, but it cannot be overlooked.",

The only limitations are those of conscience and personal power. There is no agreed upon morality or laws to limit anyone.\n \n You also run into the problem of who exactly is innocent. The psychology inherent in retaliation requires a moralistic pretext to distinguish it from raw assault. However, two sides may disagree over whether an initial act of violence was justified, or was an act of unprovoked aggression. ONe side may count the number of reprisals and feel that the scales of justice have been balanced while the other side feels they still have a score to settle. Self-deception may embolden each side's belief in the rectitude of its cause and make reconciliation impossible. Innocence and guilt would likely be difficult to distinguish.\n \n \n\n Yet the mafia or village chiefs could be seen as a government, the wars over territory perpetrated by great empires in the past are macroscopic versions of the same thing.\n\n \n As I described, villages banding together for mutual defense is the kind of self-organization that we see among individuals who then establish a governing authority. \n \n \n\n The best analogy to a world where you are your only defense against criminals is the old west.\n\n \n You don't need an analogy. Situations like the ones described by Hobbes currently exist in the South where police presence is an iffy thing. The \"culture of honor\" is very similar to the \"state of nature\", where an aggressive posture and over-reaction to slights are commonplace. \n \n Hobbes's made the observation that men fight over \"a word, a smile, a different opinion, and any other sign of undervalue\". For as long as urban crime statistics have been recorded, the most frequent cause of homicide has been \"argument\" (what police classify as \"altercation of relatively trivial origin; insult, curse, jostling, etc\"). In the research of the psychologists Daly and Wilson, they note that \"Murders result from little ol' arguments over nothing at all. Tempers flare. A fight starts, and somebody gets stabbed or shot. I've worked on cases where the principals had been arguing over a 10 cent record on a juke box, or over a one dollar gambling debt from a dice game.\"\n \n Because of the logic of deterrence, fights over personal or even national honor are not as idiotic as they seem. In a hostile environment, people and countries must advertise their willingness to retaliate against anyone who would profit at their expense, and that means maintaining a reputation for avenging any slight or trespass no matter how small. This mentality is foreign to those of us who can call up a defense by dialing 911, but that is not available to certain remote areas or pre-state societies or those unwilling to call the police to aid them (such as criminals).\n \n \n\n There is great advantage in forming a government, but it defeats the purpose if it fails to fulfill it's function which is to protect rights.\n\n \n Yes, those beyond the reach of the gov't (as in remote areas) would likely revert to something similar to a \"state of nature\" unless a local type of authority was set up.\n \n \n\n I would like to see how modern data supports that.\n \n Wow, that's pretty violent. So for which of these (besides the burglar slaying) had a rational interest in violence.\n \n Remember rational does not just mean the quickest path to any given objective, to be rational it must integrate with all an individuals knowledge in non-contradiction.\n\n \n I've given modern examples that support the contentions.\n \n What is irrational about torching a rival company? What is irrational about stealing from a store? What is irrational about the violence shown that day? Short-sighted and self-interested, perhaps, but not irrational.",

However, two sides may disagree over whether an initial act of violence was justified, or was an act of unprovoked aggression.\n\n That is true, but the confusion is the usually the result of collectivist variables clouding peoples judgement.\n \n When defining the aggressor as the first to violate any rights one arrives at the correct conclusion about the guilty party even with complicated circumstances.\n \nONe side may count the number of reprisals and feel that the scales of justice have been balanced while the other side feels they still have a score to settle. Self-deception may embolden each side's belief in the rectitude of its cause and make reconciliation impossible. Innocence and guilt would likely be difficult to distinguish.\n\n Disagreement with how a group defends itself is a far cry from disagreement over the aggressor.\n \n I make clear distinction for myself the disapproval that comes from the belief I could have handled it better and the disapproval that comes from the belief that a party is in the wrong.\n \n \nAs I described, villages banding together for mutual defense is the kind of self-organization that we see among individuals who then establish a governing authority. \n\n Yet the chaos remains, it simply releases itself in terrible international war. An anarchy of individuals cannot be arguably inferior to an anarchy of nations. Only those who live between the falls think so.\n \n It is important that the governments people form act morally as well.\n \n A corporation is a good analogy for a proper government, in a \"everyone for themselves\" anarchy self-defense would get harder, so would many other things such as building a vehicle.\n \n People have constructed for themselves corporations that manufacture cars much more efficiently and higher quality than any group of independent craftsmen could have.\n \n A government is such a corporation, it offers to make more efficient and grant higher quality to the need for self-defense. (I include the protection of all rights as self-defense)\n \n Unlike car's this business of defending people requires understanding of morality, it's application in law.\n \n That's why we see differences between the a proper government and a normal corporation.\n \n Some may say that if you consider it like that you will have competing \"protection firms\" and that competition would be violent.\n \n I would then ask what you call nations....\n \n \nYou don't need an analogy. Situations like the ones described by Hobbes currently exist in the South where police presence is an iffy thing. The \"culture of honor\" is very similar to the \"state of nature\", where an aggressive posture and over-reaction to slights are commonplace. \n\n Granny! put that shotgun down!\n \n \nHobbes's made the observation that men fight over \"a word, a smile, a different opinion, and any other sign of undervalue\". For as long as urban crime statistics have been recorded, the most frequent cause of homicide has been \"argument\" (what police classify as \"altercation of relatively trivial origin; insult, curse, jostling, etc\"). In the research of the psychologists Daly and Wilson, they note that \"Murders result from little ol' arguments over nothing at all. Tempers flare. A fight starts, and somebody gets stabbed or shot. I've worked on cases where the principals had been arguing over a 10 cent record on a juke box, or over a one dollar gambling debt from a dice game.\"\n\n Interesting, in my ethical analysis I am concerned primarily with the moral implications and secondarily with practical implications.\n \n Moral men don't become violent of 10 cents, in fact they don't become violent over anything except the violation of their rights which never come from each other. \n \n \nBecause of the logic of deterrence, fights over personal or even national honor are not as idiotic as they seem. In a hostile environment, people and countries must advertise their willingness to retaliate against anyone who would profit at their expense, and that means maintaining a reputation for avenging any slight or trespass no matter how small. This mentality is foreign to those of us who can call up a defense by dialing 911, but that is not available to certain remote areas or pre-state societies or those unwilling to call the police to aid them (such as criminals).\n\n So basically be a tough guy or they will pick on you, and this 911 mentality exists because we have offloaded our tough guy posturing to a very large body.\n \n The united states as a whole has invested great wealth and effort into being a very bad thing to attack.\n \n 911 is \"leave me alone or the united states government will have a problem with you\"\n \n We must leave this foolishness behind, I do offer the formalization of past savageries as solution to their result.\n \n The first step to inspiring anyone to anything is to expect it of them.\n \n I expect everyone to be rational, moral, I expect that we form our governments and companies to reflect our knowledge and integrity.\n \n I expect violence to be used to defend rights and nothing more, I expect that this society of liberated persons will ignore the meaningless lines jotted in the sand by such a tribal chest pounding mentality.\n \n I would not give tribute or praise to any government which violated rights just as I would not care about a thug any more than his ability to inflict damage on me or others.\n \n Do not look at irrationality, immorality, cowardice and think \"this is humanity, idealism is impractical\", it is not humanity any more than a broken roof is a house.\n \n Hobbes it appears made observation on how to build a government for quibbling brutes, concern yourself with a government for free individuals and only then will we see our society stop reflecting such things.\n \n \nWhat is irrational about torching a rival company?\n \n What is irrational about stealing from a store? What is irrational about the violence shown that day? Short-sighted and self-interested, perhaps, but not irrational.\n \n\n It is in contradiction with ethics, which is knowledge of mankind.\n \n To put it in excessively simple terms \"if you are allowed to torch a rival, they are allowed to torch you\"\n \n There is a coherent philosophy in which you simply do whatever you want, you don't care if your victims have rights because you don't want rights yourself. You simply live as an parasitic animal.\n \n These people are brutes and you cannot find a rational reason dissuade them, instead by their own unspoken premise that might makes right you resign yourself to war with them.\n \n The fact that they universally ignore the nature of man means they appear to have no internal contradictions but that is not the case, there is a contradiction. They are human and so are in contradiction with themselves.\n \n A man who lives like a non-man, who lives not by production but destruction.",

   "Only if you agreed that no one is to be able to buy groceries, the mere fact of delegation does not remove the right.\n\n \n Yes, it does. If you delegate the authority to act in your stead, and then act for yourself you have broken faith with the person you delegated authority to. You have essentially lied, since you kept the authority. On this small scale, I would be offended if someone asked me to do something for them, and then they did it themselves.\n \n \n\n Yet the fact remains that you believe you have the right to self defense even after delegating it to the government.\n \n Perhaps what you mean is that so long as the government does it for you, you won't need to exercise that right.\n\n \n You have the right because the power of immediate self-defense has not be delegated to the government. However, punishment of wrongdoers has been delegated. If someone tries to copy Batman they would be sought and arrested because citizens do not have the authority to punish criminals. \n \n \n\n Morality is independent of social contracts and personal conscience; Ideally both reflect the former.\n \n So I repeat I would not have to kill or harm anyone who is innocent, I do not have the right to violate some one else's rights even in anarchy.\n\n \n If you're referring to the Judeo-Christian God, you are merely exchanging one authority for another. In a similar way, you are delegating the authority to punish wrongdoers to God, and if you attempt to claim the authority to punish sinners you have broken faith with God. You do not have that authority through either secular or religious law. Only where no authority is present do you have the authority to punish others for wrongdoing.\n \n \n\n Yet the chaos remains, it simply releases itself in terrible international war. An anarchy of individuals cannot be arguably inferior to an anarchy of nations. Only those who live between the falls think so.\n \n It is important that the governments people form act morally as well.\n\n \n Yes, nations follow the same reasoning Hobbes outlines for individuals, but there is no outside authority all nations can appeal to in order to resolve conflicts, no 911 to call when there is an aggressor nation.\n \n Waiting for God to strike down a nation if it is in the wrong is not a solution many, if any, would consider. If you have a neighboring country, they covet what you have, in which case you have become an obstacle to their desires. Therefore you must be prepared to defend yourself. Defense is an iffy thing, so the only option for self-protection may be to wipe out potentially hostile neighbors first in a preemptive strike.\n \n Tragically, you might arrive at this conclusion even if you didn't have an aggressive bone in your body. All it would take is the realization that others might covet what you have and a strong desire not to be massacred. Even more tragically, your neighbors have every reason to be cranking through the same deduction, and if they are, it makes your fears all the more compelling, which makes a preemptive strike all the more tempting, which makes a preemptive strike by them all the more tempting, and so on. This is the \"Hobbesian trap\". Even if neither nation wants war, they may be caught in it in order to avoid being destroyed first.\n \n Even better, since there are safety in numbers, humans form coalitions and alliances for protection. There is also danger in numbers because neighbors may fear they are becoming outnumbered and form alliances in turn to match the growing threat. So two parties with no prior animus can find themselves at war when the ally of one attacks the ally of the other. The political scientists John Vasquez has used a database of hundreds of conflicts from the past two centuries and concludes that the ingredients of the Hobbesian trap can statistically predict the escalation of friction to war.\n \n \n\n So basically be a tough guy or they will pick on you, and this 911 mentality exists because we have offloaded our tough guy posturing to a very large body.\n [...]\n I expect everyone to be rational, moral, I expect that we form our governments and companies to reflect our knowledge and integrity.\n [...]\n Do not look at irrationality, immorality, cowardice and think \"this is humanity, idealism is impractical\", it is not humanity any more than a broken roof is a house.\n\n \n Practical does not equal immoral. How do you think morality evolved in the first place? It is a reflection of the practical.\n \n Many creatures, including humans, cooperate, nuture and make peace. Mutualism, symbiosis or cooperation enhances survival. Sympathy and trust prompt people to extend the first favor. Gratitude and loyalty prompt them to repay favors. Guilt and shame deter them from hurting or failing to repay others. Anger and contempt prompt them to avoid or punish cheaters. Partnerships, friendships, alliances and communities emerge, cemented by these emotions and concerns. \n \n These moralistic emotions are uncanny implementations of the strategies for reciprocal altruism in computer simulations and mathematical models. Experiments have confirmed the prediction that people are most inclined to help a stranger when they can do so at low cost, when the stranger is in need, and when the stranger is in a position to reciprocate. They like people who grant them favors, grant favors to those they like, feel guilty when they have withheld a possible favor, and punish those who withold favors from them.\n \n \n\n Hobbes it appears made observation on how to build a government for quibbling brutes, concern yourself with a government for free individuals and only then will we see our society stop reflecting such things.\n\n \n Not brutes, but rational and self-interested individuals.\n \n \n\n It is in contradiction with ethics, which is knowledge of mankind.\n \n To put it in excessively simple terms \"if you are allowed to torch a rival, they are allowed to torch you\"\n \n There is a coherent philosophy in which you simply do whatever you want, you don't care if your victims have rights because you don't want rights yourself.

When we say \"science says\" we mean \"this knowledge was objectively gained using sound and cogent logic\"\n \n The objective morality may be decided by an objective rational person but just like a scientist research isn't correct because hes a scientist this is not correct because of any intrinsic property of the man.\n \n The truth is the authority, everything that is said about morality is either correct or incorrect on the standard of reality.\n \n It is not subjective and it is not relative.

The good or evil of social interactions.\n \n There are a list of actions which are evil, and a list that is good (which is the inverse of what is evil).\n \n It is actually that simple.\n \nWhat are it's effects? \n\n Both it's correct and incorrect applications to behavior have had profound effects throughout history.\n \n It is practical but it does not exist for that reason.\n \n Cases where civilizations and individuals decline or fail at their primary purpose are usually locations of some form of immorality.\n \n \nHow is it measured?\n\n By observation and thought experiments.\n \n When I compare some action to the actions of Nazi's that only has meaning to you because you already measured the morality of Nazi's to be negative or evil.\n \n You measure by observing the different actions and analyzing them against the chart of morality which is defined by the reason it exists, the nature of man.\n \n You discover the laws that create both moral and immoral actions.\n \n The laws you discover are usually called principles, just like science these laws help you analyze the moral implications of actions just like the law of gravitation helps you analyze the behavior of masses.\n \n \nYes, they're called sociopaths. They lack empathy and compassion, which the vast majority of people possess. Empathy and compassion are mental modules that evolved, as all of our emotions have.\n\n It is not empathy that keeps me from murdering people it's my knowledge of morality.\n \n Because it is wrong it is emotionally negative for me.\n \n Every Time you go into a rage your emotions are not working to keep you from being violent.\n \n Emotions follow rules and are predictable but very few people it seems figure this out.\n \n Emotions are the direct result of your beliefs, your premises.\n \n How did Hitler find so many sociopaths? or was it their reason which was corrupted? did their empathy for other races disappear because of a psychological epidemic or because they believed it was a fallacy to be compassionate to these?\n \n \nTo say that morality is practical is to say that morality serves a purpose.\n\n True\n \nSince rational, self-interested beings form communities and a person that you describe would be destructive to the individuals of that community, I don't see how what you said here can possibly be supported.\n\n The person I describe? you mean the man who does not believe in morality? or that man that believes it is objective?\n \n \nI speak in terms of authority and power because morality is not part of political order, which is what Hobbes was referring to.\n\n I see, so you are merely concerned with the application of morality by authorities not it's definition.\n \nI do think we all have a moral sense that is a product of evolution. We also have violent tendencies that are a product of evolution. We are also self-interested, rational individuals.\n\n Obviously if you think all that we are is a product of evolution, how we came to be is irrelevant at this point for this discussion.\n \n Morality is what it is, and it is objective.\n \n One could say that our knowledge of geography is the evolution of the importance of map-making skills but it would not mean that geography changes because of what evolution made. Evolution changes life for what is geography.\n \n \nI'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand. You're saying that I don't believe morality can be rational? That is absolutely not true.

A man who tells the truth because the law tells him to will lie as soon as the law says to lie.\n\n I agree.\n \nIt is not within the government's ability to make us moral people.\n\n Quite true.\n \nFreedom,sorry about the delay in getting back to you,i tried to answer yesterday but they said my response wasn't long enough so i'll try again.First of all,you're welcome.I believe the old lady scenario would constitute a valid reason,at least to me.I'm glad the absolute definition for theft was clear.No,i dont believe it's murder if it's self defense,at least in most case's.Yes i agree for the most part with the refined way of putting it.And yes,the act of violating someones rights forfeits your own,at least in this regard.The innocence defense could probably be considered moral killing/harming,although if i killed someone even in self defense,it would probably still bother me to a degree nonetheless because i'd still be taking another life.I agree with your analogy of armies and murder.You say you would find it impossible,thank you.And yes,finding the facts are indeed challenging Freedom.Thanks for responding to my post,and again my apologies for the delay getting back to you.:)\n\n Well we don't seem to disagree on much :p\n \n Kinda puts damper on debate :)",

   "Sorry for the length, some of the concepts are complex and I wanted to explain them as thoroughly as I could.\n \n \nIf there are many users do they each betray the faith of the others the instant they use the right?\n \n I don't agree, it is not implicit in the definition of delegate and if it is, delegate is the incorrect word to be using for rights.\n \n You delegate the right to portions of your property when you use an investment broker, you do not lose the right to property because you delegated it.\n \n If you told a neighbor that it was alright to close your fence that does not mean you can't close your fence.\n\n \n Delegate is the proper word to use, since the use of the power you delegate now belongs to another. Your use of that power is then invalid, and you have broken faith with that other person (or community), and are a free rider since you benefit from political order but don't contribute to it. Administering justice is no longer a power individuals possess.\n \n More to the point, our power under the government is much more limited than without a government. We have invested some of that power over our lives to the governing agency. To deny that this is so goes beyond nonsensical.\n \n \n\n The objective morality may be decided by an objective rational person but just like a scientist research isn't correct because hes a scientist this is not correct because of any intrinsic property of the man.\n \n The truth is the authority, everything that is said about morality is either correct or incorrect on the standard of reality.\n \n It is not subjective and it is not relative. If ethics was created (as opposed to discovered) by a person it would necessarily be subjective, the subject being him.\n\n \n Truly? Hmm.\n \n Julie and Mark are brother and sister. They are traveling together in France on a summer vacation from college. One night they are staying alone in a cabin by the beach. They decide that it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love. At the very least it would be a new experience. Julie was already taking birth contol pills but just to be safe Mark uses a condom too. They both enjoy making love, but they decide never to do it again. They keep the night a special secret, which makes them feel even closer to each other. Is this morally correct or incorrect?\n \n A woman is cleaning out her closet, and she finds her old American flag. She doesn't want the flag anymore, so she cuts it up into pieces and uses the rags to clean her bathroom. Was this morally wrong?\n \n A family's dog was killed by a car in front of their house. They had heard that dog meat was delicious, so they cut up the dog's body and cooked it for dinner. Was there anything bad about this?\n \n A man goes to the supermarket once a week and buys a dead chiccken. But before cooking the chicken, he has sexual intercourse with it. Then he cooks and eats it. \n \n How do you measure the morality of these actions? Scientific facts exist in the material world, are measurable and repeatable. Where is the standard that you measure morality against to determine whether it is correct or incorrect?\n \n \n\n I disagree, if a government was formed with no method of keeping policy secrets even from it's enemies trust on national intentions would be a given.\n\n \n Your vision has been tried. The first revolution with this Utiopian Vision was the French Revolution. Teh revolution overthrew the ancient regime and sought to begin from scratch with the ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity and abelief that salvation would come from vesting authority in a morally superior breed of leaders. The revolution, of course, sent one leader after another to the guillotine as each failed to measure up to usurpers who felt they had a stronger claim to wisdom and virtue. No political structure survived the turnover, leaving a vacuum to be filled by Napoleon. The Russion Revolution was animated by this same type of vision and burned through leaders until it settled for the cult of personality in the form of Stalin. The Chinese revolution, too, put faith in the benevolence and wisdom of it's leader. Human nature proves that it is futile to base political revolutions on the moral aspirations of revolutionaries.\n \n Game theory shows that such a government is unlikely to exist and, if it did, others would not follow suit (and thus that hypothetical gov't would quickly be destroyed).\n \n Take the Ultimatum Game. One participant gets a large sum of money to divide between himself and second participant and the second one only decides whether to take or leave it. If he leaves it, neither one gets anything. Now, a selfish proposer would keep the lion's share; a selfish responder would accept the remaining crumbs no matter how small because part of a loaf is better than none. However, in reality the proposer tends to offer almost half the total sum and the respondent does not accept much less than half even if turning down the smaller share out of nothing but spite means that neither get anything at all. The respondent is driven by righteous anger and punishes a selfish proposer accordingly; the proposer anticipates this and makes an offer that is just generous enough to be accepted. We know the generosity is driven out of fear because of the outcomes of other variants of the same game.\n \n In the Dictator Game, the proposer simply divides the sum between the two players and the respondent cannot do anything about it. With no fear of reprisal, the proposer makes a far stingier offer. The offer tends to be more generous than it strictly needs to be, because the proposer does not want a reputation for stinginess that will bite him in the long run. We know this because of the outcome of the Double-Blind Dictator Game, where the proposals are sealed and the respondent doesn't know who proposed what. When this happens the majority of proposers keep everything for themselves.\n \n And then there is the Public Good Game, where everyone makes a voluntary contribution to a common pot of money, the experimenter doubles it and then the pot is divided evenly among all the participants regardless of how much the contributed. The optimal strategy for each player is to contribute nothing and hope others contribute everything, hoping to get a share of what everyone else contributes. Of course, if everyone thinks this way then the pot stays empty and no one gets anything. The optimum strategy for the group is for everyone to contribute everything they have so they all double their money. When the game is repeatedly played, everyone tries to become a free rider and the pot dwindles to zero. However, if people are able to levy fines against those who don't contribute then, well, conscience doth make cowards of them all and everyone contributes to the common good.\n \n Your hypothetical gov't that seems to blindly trust others would be taken advantage of until it no longer exists, or simply destroyed if it did not possess overwhelming military force to defend it against those who covet what it possesses.\n \n \n\n I am sure you know already, ethics speaks specifically of one grouping of good, evil evaluations. The good or evil of social interactions.\n \n There are a list of actions which are evil, and a list that is good (which is the inverse of what is evil).\n\n \n A list? Who created this list and where is it located?\n \n \n\n By observation and thought experiments.\n \n When I compare some action to the actions of Nazi's that only has meaning to you because you already measured the morality of Nazi's to be negative or evil.\n \n You measure by observing the different actions and analyzing them against the chart of morality which is defined by the reason it exists, the nature of man.\n \n You discover the laws that create both moral and immoral actions.\n\n \n A chart of morality? I'm seriously mystified. You claim this has nothing to do with the Judeo-Christian God, yet seem to be pointing to something like a Bible, created by the moral authority of God, to tell us what is moral and immoral. Is there any way you can clarify this?\n \n \n\n The laws you discover are usually called principles, just like science these laws help you analyze the moral implications of actions just like the law of gravitation helps you analyze the behavior of masses.\n\n \n There are ethical theories, but some of them are contradictory such as Kantian and Utilitarian ethical theories. How do you choose between them?\n \n \n\n It is not empathy that keeps me from murdering people it's my knowledge of morality.\n\n \n You aren't helping your case. That's the same reason sociopaths are able to fit into society without emotional responses, which means they have no conscience. They observe the behavior of others and determine what rules govern their actions and then follow those rules to fit in. The ones who kill people are the ones who don't try to fit in. The rest of us don't kill people because of our emotional responses (including empathy for others and fear of consequences). Your view would imply that people are Machiavellian cynics, coldly calculating the moral value of each action. That simply is not the case.\n \n Instead, morality is steeped in emotion. The emotions of sympathy, gratitude, and guilt are the sourse of innumerable acts of kindness great and small, and a measured righteous anger and ethical certitude must have sustained great moral leaders throughout history. \n \n \n\n Because it is wrong it is emotionally negative for me.\n\n \n Now... is it wrong because of the emotions involved or are the emotions involved because it is objectively wrong? How are you able to distinguish between the two?\n \n \n\n Every Time you go into a rage your emotions are not working to keep you from being violent.\n \n Emotions follow rules and are predictable but very few people it seems figure this out.\n \n Emotions are the direct result of your beliefs, your premises.\n\n \n That is completely unsupported by the data. If it were true then emotions would vary more across cultures but, instead, follow the predictions of evolutionary psychology and vary little across cultures.\n \n Anger is not meant to keep you from violence. Anger is an other-condemning emotion (which includes contempt, anger and disgust) which prompts us to punish cheaters (such as those who break faith with us). Other-priasing emotions (gratitude and an emotion that can be called elevation, moral awe, or being moved) prompt one to reward altruists. The other-suffering emotions( sympathy, compassion and empathy) prompt one to help a needy beneficiary. The self-conscious emotions (guilt, shame and embarrassment) prompt one to avoid cheating or repair its effects.\n \n There are three spheres of morality, each of which frame moral judgments in a different way. The three are autonomy, community, and divinity (refering to a sense of exalted purity and holiness). Anger is the other-condemning emotion in the sphere of autnomy, evolved from systems for aggression and was recruited to implement the cheater-punishment strategy demanded by reciprocal altruism. \n \n \nHow did Hitler find so many sociopaths? or was it their reason which was corrupted? did their empathy for other races disappear because of a psychological epidemic or because they believed it was a fallacy to be compassionate to these?\n\n \n Certainly unless we are psychopaths we sympathize with other people and do not blithely treat them as obstacles or prey. Such sympathy certainly has not prevented people from committing all manner of atrocities through history and pre-history. The reason is that people discern a moral circle that may not embrace all human beings, but only members of their own clan, village, or tribe. Inside this circle, fellow humans are targets of sympathy but outside they are treated like a rock or a river or a lump of food (for cannibals). More recently our moral circle has expanded as our technology has made us more cosmopolitan.\n \n However, this moral circle can also shrink. We can see that atrocities are often accompanied by tactics of dehumanizing such as the use of pejorative names, degrading conditions, humiliating dress, and jokes that make light of their suffering. These tactics flip a kind of mental switch that remove them from the oppressor's moral circle, making it easier to torture or kill them. One of the best examples of this is the Stanford Prison Experiement, where a random set of students were divided into guards and prisoners. The prisoners wore smocks, leg irons and nylon-stocking caps and were referred to by serial numbers. Before long the guards began brutalizing them and the experiment had to be halted for the subjects safety. \n \n The switch can go in the other direction too. In the 1985 apartheid in South Africa there was a demonstration that was broken up with the typical brutaliy by police, and one policeman chased down a black woman to beat her with his club. As she ran, her shoe slipped off and, as every well-brought-up Afrikaner would, the policeman stopped to pick it up for her. When he handed her back her shoe he left, since clubbing her was no longer an option. She had been re-humanized in his eyes.\n \n \n\n One could say that our knowledge of geography is the evolution of the importance of map-making skills but it would not mean that geography changes because of what evolution made. Evolution changes life for what is geography.\n \n I'm saying I think you think that root is the practical needs of societies.\n\n \n Emotions and morality evolved for the practical needs of individuals, who tend to form and live in societies.",

The governing authority has authority out of a public agreement to confer power and status, and to honor it as long as other people do. \n \n \n\n It is not immoral, i.e. they have a right to do it.\n \n You can come up with many sexual scandals much worse than that one, but confusing the issue with disgusting hypotheticals will not change the fact that morality is objective.\n \n An opinion is not objective knowledge, because people have been told morality is akin to an opinion or emotion they often associate morality with emotions when no moral situation is implied.\n \n The reason many people would be against this is because they know dogs and consider them in some way family or friends. Yet if you tried to explain to a Chinese chef why it was wrong they would instantly point out that we slaughter and eat other animals, and ask why a dog is different.\n \n Why don't you have one with all forms of sodomy?\n \n You ask \"do they violate any rights?\"\n [...]\n Yet you throw emotion out the door when it is rage, jealousy, lust for revenge, and spite.\n \n In these cases it is advised that you control your emotions and consider what the right thing to do is as opposed to what you are feeling.\n \n Are you telling me that for you that advise merely means switching to a more \"favorable\" emotion?\n\n \n It doesn't really matter whether they are moral or immoral, I'm looking for how you determine which it is. Sex is one of the most proscribed activities so it is easy to use in examples.\n \n You are right that many people associate morality with emotion and there is a reason for this. Many of our emotions evolved for moralistic purposes, and to allow us to live together in some type of community. Some of those emotional reactions are irrelevent today, and some continue to serve us well. \n \n Emotions aren't \"right or wrong\" or \"favorable or unfavorable\". They serve a purpose. When you burn with jealousy, there is a reason for that. When you're angry at an insult, there is a reason for that. When you feel gratitude at a favor, there's a reason for that.\n \n All of these emotions evolved for a purpose. I am not trying to suggest that our moral sense is infallible or that any actions out of emotion are correct. Our moral sense is a gadget that evolved, like stereo vision or intuition about numbers. It is laden with quirks and systematic error (moral illusions, as it were). \n \n Many of the examples I gave you, such as the siblings having sex and eating the family dog are intuitively immoral. Look at your reaction, in fact. You expressed disgust at the actions involved. That is an intuitive reaction... that is your evolved moral sense in action. That is not to say that those reactions are correct, instead I was showing that our moral sense is connected to our emotions, and both evolved with us.\n \n However, none of those actions were immoral to this \"objective morality\" because all of those activities were \"rights\"? How do you determine what is or is not a right? Just what you are physically able to do? Is it a form of the \"golden rule\" (do unto others...)?\n \n \n\n and what of the united states? not the moral aspirations of revolutionaries then what?\n \n Does it not matter how well those moral aspirations are known and accepted, does it not matter how committed people are to their implementation?\n\n \n No, it does not. The Constitution certainly does not extoll morality or \"doing what's right\". It essentially allows us to be as moral or immoral as we please, within the restrictions of the laws in place. The ideals in place are order, not morality, which are the purpose of laws in the first place. It actually exemplifies Hobbe's ideals and the selfishness of human nature. \n \n \n\n On the assumption that the country with unknown policy is in a stronger position than one with known policy.\n \n I think merely the advantage of the unyielding trust such a government would have would make it's ability to make allies a stronger advantage than it's inability to hide what it wants.\n\n \n I'm not sure what difference known or unknown policies would make. As the saying goes: Actions speak louder than words. \n \n However, that's not the point I am making. Game theory shows again and again that any purely altruistic actor or strategy would quickly cease to exist. It simply is not viable when there are cheaters in the system. Without an authority or method to punish cheaters the purely altruistic actor loses every game.\n \n \n\n I have identified it and anyone using the proper methods can as well, it has too many terms to write out so it exists only as an abstract in it's entirety\n \n The list I just referred to, I am sorry I said you when I was talking about an abstract person.\n \n You probably think the nazi's are evil because what they have done causes negative emotions, or it is impractical for the global society.\n\n \n There are many reasons to condemn the Nazi's actions. The one you cite here is the Utilitarian answer (since an action is moral or immoral based upon the total happiness or unhappiness it creates). Kant's categorical imperative would be violated since the Jews were being used as a means to an end. It would violate several moral principles such as the principle of Nonmaleficense, the principle of Beneficence and likely the principle of Double Effect.\n \n \n\n I have tried to be clear, perhaps your error is that you seem to think that one cannot point to a universal morality except one coming from God.\n \n Which is actually a failure to recognize one of my first premises, that morality is objective. A morality gleaned from God is still a subjective morality, the subject in that case being God, it is only universal because God is universal.\n \n Morality is not subjective, so I don't need to point to any authority except facts themselves.\n \n Objectivism is the closest one to correct in the published sphere.\n [...]\n For the most part I can't, but since I have this knowledge I don't need to care about my emotions they will follow my belief sets.\n \n For instance when I was a child I had a problem with lying, I felt no negative emotion so long as no one found out.\n \n After constructing my philosophy and determining lying is objectively wrong I now feel guilt about lying regardless of whether someone finds out or not.\n \n I have very strong emotions of regret when I remember what I did.\n \n Not only did this give me a great since of empowerment over what was previously a rationally unpredictable mesh of thought and feeling, it is direct evidence that what I have said is true\n\n \n You're likely right. I simply do not comprehend exactly what you mean by an objective moral code. If you explain Objectivism a bit more maybe I'll understand better.\n \n These \"moral facts\"... how are they discovered? Where do you learn them? A constructed moral code does not sound any different from, say, Kant's ethical theory, which also has lying as an absolute wrong.\n \n \n\n The desire for glory pushes an engineer for to create the greatest project, but it is cold calculations and planning that make the greatest project.\n \n Emotion in a healthy person is deeply intertwined in morality, and in other things as well such as personal goals, and virtues.\n \n pain and pleasure do for the body what emotion does for the mind provides immediate feedback as to the current state of the one's self, of whether you are behaving in a correct manner.\n [...]\n Your emotions will only be as correct as your belief sets, that you feel guilt about killing someone is good. It means you believe it is wrong.\n\n \n I'm a bit confused about your belief now. As you say, you feel guilty when you know you've done something wrong. I don't know how you can deny that our moral sense is tied to our emotions. Since our morality is tied to our emotions, where does this universal moral code come in?\n \n You may believe calculating moral worth is more efficent or more correct, but I am not here making a case to prefer an emotional moral code. I am here telling you that we have an emotional moral code and that we don't coldly calculate the moral worth of our actions when we perform them. Our emotional moral code might lead to atrocities, and historically it certainly does. But that simply shows that we have an evolved moral sense tied into our emotions.\n \n \n\n You won't find me rewarding any altruist :p\n\n \n Why? Altruism isn't a good thing to this universal morality?\n \n \n\n So the only reasons emotions fail to enforce morality is the assumption that someone else is not human?\n \n Here is a question for you, a man finds out his wife is cheating on him and his emotions tell him to rip this other guys head off.\n \n Is it right for him to do so?\n \n More importantly how can you feel anger or hatred towards someone you don't think of as human?\n\n \n You might want to check what the term \"dehumanizing\" means. It doesn't seem you're interpreting it correctly. It isn't about what species you think the other person belongs to.\n \n In your example, the man's anger had moral justification but the harm he did was not equal to the harm he received. Our moral sense desires commensurate harm (which most would term \"justice\") and our hypothetical actor will likely feel guilty for the overcompensation.\n \n \n\n Morality exists because we are not animals.\n\n \n This does not follow. We are animals.",

   "The Ayn Rand Institute: Introduction to Objectivism\n \n Keep in mind I endorse objectivism as the best philosophy held by more people than just me and my family/friends I do not want to hear \"well you believe in objectivism so you must believe this or that\"\n \n For instance I believe he talks about the purpose of government, I disagree that it's function needs to be static.\n\n \n An Atomist! \n \n Ayn Rand's writings are an interesting read, but some of the concepts are not compatible with how we instinctually think about people. The philosophy is materialistic, but people generally adopt a dualistic approach out of necessity. We move thoughts by thinking, we move matter with other bits of matter. Matter is what we call bits that we cannot control with our thoughts. If everything were matter, everthing would would be inanimate and there would be no deliberate action and no legal or moral culpability. If everything were thought, everyone would be omnipotent and at rest, for there would be no need for action. \n \n So, then, we adopt a dualistic approach, an underlying reality with a nexus where final cause relates to mechanical cause. However, to an materialist, matter is all there is, there is no mystical essence or spirit. So, then, what is consciousness? It, along with free will, should be an epiphenomenon, an emergent property of matter in motion. We would be organic robots operating according to cause an effect. \n \n \n Pointing out that someone will force you to do something or not do something is not equivalent to pointing out that you have a right to do something or not to do something.\n \n I still have the ability to harm others, I don't have the right to violate their rights and I never will.\n \n I still have the right of self-defense and I will never relinquish it.\n \n A contract is signed by those parties who agree.\n\n \n No, no, it isn't about you being forced to delegate authority at all! Lacking authority is a condition of living in the society; you are punished for breaking rules you do not have the authority to break. You agree simply by living here. You have the ability to harm others, but not the authority.\n \n I must point out that Rand believes the \"proper functions of a government\" includes the police, the armed services and the courts. In addition, the governing authority acts as the agent of its citizens and has \"no rights except the rights delegated to it by the citizens\". The \"social contract\" view of society is very much an atomist, or individualistic, type of view. I'm not sure why you so passionately argue against it. It reinforces the notion that individuals make up society instead of society being considered an entity in it's own right.\n \n \n\n Then evil is necessary.\n\n \n Well, it seems that any restriction on freedom besides what is necessary to allow us to survive is unjustified so... yes, it appears it is. \n \n Now, the philosophy of objectivism (and what you seem to express) obviously values full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism as the most moral system of government. However, historically, unregulated capitalism has lead to businesses forming monopolies which is actually then distructive to the consumer which would limit our individual freedoms. I'm not sure the system of government you want can exist for very long in the form you want it to.\n \n \n\n I expressed disgust at the siblings because it is unnatural, just as I think homo-sexuality is.\n \n In a way unnatural is equal to immoral but not within the social sphere.\n \n There is a difference between personal morality and social morality but none of us ever need to agree to the former so I did not mention it.\n\n \n You express disgust because you feel disgust. It is an instinctual reaction programmed into us through evolution. Morally proscribing incest is a reaction to the psychological reaction it evokes. It's not mysterious. \n \n It isn't about personal morality, it is about the origin of our moral sense. \n \n People have sex with whom they interact the most and those of the same class, religion, race and appearance. The forces of sexual attraction should pull siblings together like magnets, and there should be millions of brothers and sisters wanting to have sex. Instead there are virtually none in our society, in any well-studied human society or in most animals in the wild. Avoiding incest is universal across cultures (not necessarily individuals) even if incest taboos are not. There are sound biological reasons for this.\n \n It is not because of any personal moral code that prevents this. Psychological reactions are programmed into us by evolution. There is no stretch of the imagination to say that reactions relating to morality are evolutionarily based and are similar across cultures.\n \n \n\n No altruism is required, of course it corrupts the actions of people and nations and leads to incorrect conclusions about how they should function.\n \n I giggle every time you bring kant up.\n\n \n Yes, altruism would naturally be counter to Objectivism since that philosophy is inherently selfish.\n \n Actually, Kant's ethics seem similar to Objectivism even if his theory of knowledge is not. Kant's hypothetical imperative is essentially the same as Rand's \"science of ethics\" (do this if you want that result).\n \n \n\n In the end though your reasons are practical.\n \n The view that morality is the result of an evolutionary process necessitates that view because evolution is a process of practicality.\n\n \n I'm not sure how you can criticize that, since Objectivism has the ultimate practical value: Anything that preserves your life is moral, anything that threatens it is immoral. Pleasure is good, pain is bad. It seems hedonistic, even if Rand takes pains to say that it is not.\n \n \n\n It would be more correct to say our emotions are tied to our moral sense. The universal moral code comes in because it is the correct moral sense.\n\n \n And since emotions are part of our evolution, it provides a rational alternate answer to the source of morality. There need be no \"fact of reality\" governing our morality.\n \n \n\n Once you go through all the motions you do see that altruism is not merely helping another it is helping another for no reason.\n \n I am opposed to anything without reason.\n\n \n Reciprocal altruism is a necessary component of cooperative behavior. It has a reason, no worries.\n \n \n\n I meant animals as in being whose behavior is instinctual or non-rational.\n\n \n \"Instinctual\" does not mean \"irrational\".

   "You mentioned rand or objectivism in reference to what I believe four times since I posted that link, I specifically asked you not have such a reaction.\n\n \n Well, you did say you subscribed to objectivism. I kept my scope small, and tried not to go into what you are supposed to believe. I mention Rand to separate what that philosophy espoused, and what you've already expressed a belief in.\n \n I thought I was fair in my assessment.\n \n \n\n You take morality to be programming but chafe at someone who would call man organic robots?\n\n \n Oh, it's not really surprising. However, the difference is this: Does biology and the logic of fitness influence our decision making, or is decision-making itself an illusion?\n \n The experience of choosing is not fiction, it is a real neural process. Furthermore, the description of our desires and urges as 'programming' is a metaphorical way of describing the selection of alternative genes over millennia, not a literal description of what is taking place in the human brain in real-time. People don't follow a program; instead they care about happiness, love, power, respect, and other passions. That these emotions came about through the amoral and mechanical process of evolution does not imply we ourselves are mechanical. Just as self-interest can create cooperation, a mechanical process can create emotional beings.\n \n On the other hand, emotion requires consciousness to experience it. In a purely material universe, consciousness is an epiphenomenon that cannot affect the physical world (since it is not physical itself) and free will is an illusion. Waking souls would then be slaves in denial, essentially, since something else sets the body in motion with only a summary being sent to the homunculus behind your eyes. Your consciousness then mistakes correlation for causation: it reads the summary and sees the hand moves, and it thinks that one drove the other. But it's not in charge of anything at all.\n \n What would the reason to evolve emotions be if consciousness is irrelevent, though?\n \n \n\n Not with the correct definition of selfish or greedy.\n \n I think rand ran into so many people who were threatened by the concept of an absolute objective standard for right and wrong she got confused as to what selfish means.\n \n It is little more than a political mud-sling now I have heard it so many times.\n\n \n Self-interest is hardly threatening. I think the error in reasoning is that the philosophy stopped there. Selfish motivations begets selfish behavior begets selfish philosophy. But that is a shortsighted story that does not accurately describe reality. Selfish motivations beget unselfish behavior (though this is only true because it ultimately helps the actor) because being selfish is a zero sum game (where one participant benefits to the detriment of another), while cooperation opens up the possibility of non-zero sum games (where both participants benefit).\n \n My objection is that objectivism seems to think that self-interest is all there is, which is patently false.\n \n \n\n I can criticize that because it is incorrect, species go extinct all the time as you know. The nature of man is what defines morality.\n\n \n I agree, but we don't seem to agree on what exactly the nature of man is. \n \n \n\n She was correct in the impression her novels gave, since man is an individual who lives by rational thought anything that interferes with the function of evaluation -< action is against man's nature.\n \n When someone judges something to be so and acts according to their judgement with the faculty of their mind and body it is called liberty.\n \n Individual liberty knows bounds for only one reason, the laws of physics.\n \n The nature of man is liberty.\n \n The universal integrated liberty of man kind is the standard of morality, not the personal gain of any individual.\n \n Notice the total lack of any practical terms, man is what he is and until he stops thinking or becomes a collective mind this morality is objective and universal.\n \n He may go extinct because of it or excel because of it but it is what he is.\n\n \n In other words, sacrificing himself or herself for the greater good?\n \n That is not a very individualistic thing to do.\n \n \n\n It does insofar as an action taken because of instinct is not an action taken as the result of rational thought.\n \n As a third party observer we note many instincts in animals have purpose and so the same actions may be taken by considering the facts and reaching conclusions.\n\n \n Yes, exactly. In fact, that is why emotions evolved in the first place. I can sit here and tell you about the logic of deterence, the concept of justice, the optimal game-theory strategies etc etc, but our instincts evolved to do those very same calculations without involving our conscious, rational mind. I don't know about you, but I find that fact amazing.\n \n That is not to say that a rational moral calculus would always reach the same conclusion as our instinctual mind, only that our instinctual mind was designed by evolution to make those kind of moral calculations.

But it's not in charge of anything at all.\n\n I have no idea what your are saying.\n \n \nSelf-interest is hardly threatening. I think the error in reasoning is that the philosophy stopped there. Selfish motivations begets selfish behavior begets selfish philosophy. But that is a shortsighted story that does not accurately describe reality. Selfish motivations beget unselfish behavior (though this is only true because it ultimately helps the actor) because being selfish is a zero sum game (where one participant benefits to the detriment of another), while cooperation opens up the possibility of non-zero sum games (where both participants benefit).\n\n \n You are using the word selfish incorrectly, it implies desire regardless of others just as greed means desire regardless of deserving.\n \n Just like altruism any though process which integrates into the definition the failure to consider the sum of your knowledge and consider all factors and their truth values is irrational and incorrect.\n \n Self-interest does not equal selfish.\n \n \nMy objection is that objectivism seems to think that self-interest is all there is, which is patently false.\n\n The only interest that is incorrect is interest without reason.\n \n A man should hold his own life as a value but will hold others as values too.\n \n The confusion arises when you ask why others are values, they are values as a construct from your own personal values.\n \n If you did not think music sounded good you would not value the ability to compose music in yourself or anyone else (honestly)\n \n If you thought life was a waste of time you could not value the lives of anyone including yourself.\n \n If you think life is good it would be a contradiction to think of anyone's life as inherently bad.\n \n \nI agree, but we don't seem to agree on what exactly the nature of man is. \n\n Yes, I have said that man's proper function is to put it simply: to use the scientific method, to allow no contradictory knowledge, and to pursue his/her values.\n \n What do you believe it is?\n \n \nIn other words, sacrificing himself or herself for the greater good?\n\n No\n \n \nThat is not to say that a rational moral calculus would always reach the same conclusion as our instinctual mind, only that our instinctual mind was designed by evolution to make those kind of moral calculations. Like anything else, our instincts can lead us wrong.\n\n We certainly aren't going to come to an agreement about the source of morality so long as you believe it's an evolutionary adaptation, but I don't think we really need to.\n \n Consider what I propose our attempt to use our rational faculty to do this better just as testing for poisons with a chemistry kit accomplishes the same function as tasting for bitterness once did.",

   "I said I endorsed it as the best one believed by a significant number of people.\n\n \n But you don't subscribe to it yourself? \n \n \n \n\n Decision making is not an illusion.\n \n Who said emotion is appears non-mechanical? It appears to me to be the most mechanical as it behaves in certain ways to keep your psyche in tune with your knowledge and it is not voluntary.\n\n \n Imagine you are such a mechanical creature. You have intellect but no insight, agendas but no awareness. You have strategies for survival and persistence, flexible, intelligent, even technological. Evolution and experience offers a variety of paths to follow, branch points in the flowcharts that handle input. You receive signals from conspecifics who might have useful information to share, and whose lives you'd defend according to the rules of kin selection. Some signals may arise from entities that, while not kin, can still serve as allies or symbionts in mutually beneficial persuits. You have strategies to handle those situations.\n \n These are the underlying mechanical processes that devoloped through evolution. However, we have additional circuitry that monitors the processes underneath: our conscious mind. If the mechanical brain were all there was to decision-making there would be no need for emotions to influence our conscious minds to act upon the calculations made. We would simply act. Emotions would be unneeded.\n \n \n\n I have no idea what your are saying.\n\n \n If the material universe were all there is, our conscious mind could not influence the physical world. If that is the case then free will is an illusion.\n \n \n\n You are using the word selfish incorrectly, it implies desire regardless of others just as greed means desire regardless of deserving.\n \n Just like altruism any though process which integrates into the definition the failure to consider the sum of your knowledge and consider all factors and their truth values is irrational and incorrect.\n \n Self-interest does not equal selfish.\n\n \n So, you are saying that a person who considers the sum of their knowledge and considers all factors is not selfish?\n \n Maybe if you gave me more examples :-\\\n \n \n\n The only interest that is incorrect is interest without reason.\n \n A man should hold his own life as a value but will hold others as values too.\n \n The confusion arises when you ask why others are values, they are values as a construct from your own personal values.\n \n If you did not think music sounded good you would not value the ability to compose music in yourself or anyone else (honestly)\n \n If you thought life was a waste of time you could not value the lives of anyone including yourself.\n \n If you think life is good it would be a contradiction to think of anyone's life as inherently bad.\n\n \n There are always reasons. \n \n Truly told, I am not seeing how you consider this morality \"objective\". Like any other ethical theory is has rules and conditional statements and unprovable tenets. Rand's answer the is-ought divide is not compelling so unless there's another answer we probably cannot agree.\n \n \n\n Yes, I have said that man's proper function is to put it simply: to use the scientific method, to allow no contradictory knowledge, and to pursue his/her values.\n \n What do you believe it is?\n\n \n Put simply: Human behavior is caused by thoughts and feelings.\n \n Human nature is a complex meeting of different modules that make up the human mind. We each have an innate theory of what that nature is. Everyone has to anticipate the behavior of others, which requires us to think about what makes other people tick. We adopt dualism by necessity through the \"theory of other minds\" that allow us to divine the motivations of others. We consult this theory when we want to persuade or threaten, inform or deceive. It advises us on how to nurture our marriages, bring up our children, and to control our own behavior. Its assumptions about motivation drive our policies on economics, law and crime.\n \n \n\n We certainly aren't going to come to an agreement about the source of morality so long as you believe it's an evolutionary adaptation, but I don't think we really need to.\n\n \n Perhaps not. But consider: Evolution is central to the understanding of life, including human life. The signs of engineering are everywhere. It would not be reasonable to assume that engineering stops where the brain is concerned. It is a reasonable conclusion that our brains evolved with the rest of our bodies and for the same reason: what would allow our ancestors to survive, find mates and reproduce.\n \n \n\n Consider what I propose our attempt to use our rational faculty to do this better just as testing for poisons with a chemistry kit accomplishes the same function as tasting for bitterness once did.\n\n \n It might be better, or it might not.

   "Alright Freedom, I don't think we can continue the discussion with much longer. The world you're presenting is ... disturbing, to say the least, and I don't think there is enough common ground to bridge the differences.\n \n \n\n I still cannot; what cannot be detected or measured by material science? What does that have to do with the conscious mind affecting the universe around it?\n\n \n Consciousness cannot be detected or measured by material science. Therefore it does not appear to exist in the material world. Since materialism denies the existence of the immaterial, consciousness must be an epiphenomenon, an emergent property of matter in motion and the experience of free will is an illusion in that case (since only the material world can determine actions and consciousness is not part of the material world). Since free will is an illusion, the experience that our consciousness 'wills' actions to take place must also be an illusion.\n \n \n\n I don't believe that is so.\n [...]\n What difference do you see between a sociopath and a logical person?\n [...]\n Axioms are always true. Not all basic premises are axioms\n [...]\n \"Intuitions\", \"faculties\", this is what you think man is? A sum of instincts? Why then do we disagree?\n [...]\n Should not our instincts be the same? Am I a mutant to not behave exactly the same as you?\n\n \n Axioms are not true, nor are they supposed to be treated as truths. They're just axioms. They are proof of nothing besides the fact that they are axioms. You're using them incorrectly if you're trying to use them as 'truths'.\n \n \"Instincts\" is a bit too simplistic a word for the complexity of behavior we exhibit. There is no reason for there to be identical behavior; while behavior is partly inherited we are not genetic clones of one another. \n \n Logic has nothing to do with whether or not someone is a sociopath. Sociopaths lack empathy. People with empathy are perfectly able to think and behave logically. However, people who are not sociopaths don't generally base the decision of whether or not to be kind by weighing the benefits versus the costs of that behavior. They are motivated by emotions such as empathy and sympathy.\n \n \n\n Like the example with the hovering object the existence evidence against ethical theory must take the form of contradicting its predictions.\n \n To show something happened when it is immoral is meaningless, to show that it is moral when ethics predicts it would be immoral would be evidence but it would also be self-contradictory since the only method to determine if something is moral or immoral is the science of ethics.\n \n Only on the assumption that all men will be perfectly rational at all times does it perfectly predict all behavior.\n \n\n \n The theory isn't making predictions, it's creating definitions then. Any ethical theory can define an action as moral or immoral (in fact, that's sort of what they are supposed to do). The theory of gravity in your example predicts what an object will do, while your philosophy merely defines the behavior as moral or immoral.\n \n In no way can this be called objective.\n \n \n\n Interesting, does ophthalmology have some significance to this discussion?\n\n \n Yes, since you assert all knowledge must be objective or it is not knowledge. The world delivered by our senses is not objective because our senses do not detect or record the world faithfully.

   "Alright Freedom, I don't think we can continue the discussion with much longer. The world you're presenting is ... disturbing, to say the least,\n\n It is not disturbing to me, and if it were I would ignore an emotion without rational grounding.\n \n A world in which contradiction is recognized as equivalent to fallacy, compromise on absolutes is recognized to be impossible, and emotion is recognized to be information about a person's mind and soul; not the universe around it.\n \n This does not disturb me, it occurs to me that the only people it would disturb are those who have something to lose by these recognitions.\n \n A world in which reason is the only source of knowledge is the only kind of world that can exist. The statement that reason is the only source of knowledge is an axiom. You cannot escape it. The only other option would be the non-rational which precludes disproving, proving, and logic in general.\n \n The truly mystical is marked by a lack of reason not merely incorrect reasoning.\n \n Very few are brave enough to fully disclose their abandonment of reason for the non-rational.\n \n For instance every time an evangelist christian tries to convince you, he or she will do so with a list of reasons. You may not believe the reasons or you may find them to be logically irrelevant to the conclusion.\n \n What you do not see very often is someone offering knowledge while proudly stating he did not receive it from any source he could explain to you.\n \n Yet; this premise of the mystical is what powers subjectivism, relativism, and most rare and dangerous nihilism.\n \n Man uses reason to live, non-reason will kill him.\n \n Why should I find life disturbing but not death?\n \n Why should I abandon reason?\n \n \nand I don't think there is enough common ground to bridge the differences.\n\n The only common ground required is a mutually accepted premise. We can move the base of our disagreement as far back as you want and we have. What we have run into are axioms and there is no longer anywhere to move to.\n \n \nConsciousness cannot be detected or measured by material science.\n\n You're kidding right? Maybe you heard of this one: I think therefore I am.\n \n If you mean you can't find it with a ruler or a frequency analyzer of course not.\n \n All the information we detect with scientific measurement devices is processed by our mind.\n \n In this case we did not need a measurement device the evidence is directly accessible. If you are to throw out the mind as the final and only necessary step of the scientific process then knowledge does not exist.\n \n Such a premise would explain why you believe nihilism is the result of defining knowledge as objective.\n \n \nTherefore it does not appear to exist in the material world.\n\n It certainly does. The ridiculously easy to prove does not equal the unreal.\n \nSince materialism denies the existence of the immaterial, consciousness must be an epiphenomenon, an emergent property of matter in motion and the experience of free will is an illusion in that case (since only the material world can determine actions and consciousness is not part of the material world). Since free will is an illusion, the experience that our consciousness 'wills' actions to take place must also be an illusion.\n\n To me material = existent. Would you like to define it as something else?\n \n The connection merely follow from rejecting the mystical.\n \n If something exists and the universe contains all existance then it is part of the universe or one of it's materials.\n \n Only on the premise that something exists but \"not really\" can a distinction be drawn between physical and actual.\n \n \nAxioms are not true, nor are they supposed to be treated as truths.\n\n I am afraid that has got to go in a quote as well.\n \nThey're just axioms. They are proof of nothing besides the fact that they are axioms. You're using them incorrectly if you're trying to use them as 'truths'.\n\n \n 1. a self-evident truth that requires no proof. \n 2. a universally accepted principle or rule. \n \n An axiom is truth because it defeats all attempts to disprove it. It does so because all attempts must use it as a premise (primary or secondary) to make the attempt.\n \n If an attack is made against a premise and it does not take the premise for use itself that premise is not an axiom.\n \n Both of the axioms identified by objectivism are true axioms (true as in verified axioms, not premises that were incorrectly called axioms) and you cannot escape them.\n \n \n\"Instincts\" is a bit too simplistic a word for the complexity of behavior we exhibit.\n\n Ah, I see. Your \"man\" is a fusion of a mystical non-material consciousness and complex instincts.\n \nThere is no reason for there to be identical behavior; while behavior is partly inherited we are not genetic clones of one another. \n\n The view of man as rational animal fully accounts for all disagreements, the view of man as an instinctual animal (often shorted to just animal because this is the vast majority of species) does not.\n \n There is no reason for identical behavior in creatures with the same instincts but there is reason for identical instincts in creatures with identical DNA.\n \n If you say morality is the result of instincts(which generate emotion you say) you are saying that the only way I could disagree with you on morality is if I had different instincts aka different DNA.\n \n Which is why I asked and now repeat the question; Do I reject emotion based morality because of a mutation? or I suppose now the other option would be that my mystical consciousness is making that decision, since your purely material human has no consciousness and no capability of true choice.\n \n \nLogic has nothing to do with whether or not someone is a sociopath.\n\n I see, so behaving logically can never make you a sociopath?\n \nSociopaths lack empathy. People with empathy are perfectly able to think and behave logically. \n\n I will agree with you there.\n \nHowever, people who are not sociopaths don't generally base the decision of whether or not to be kind by weighing the benefits versus the costs of that behavior. They are motivated by emotions such as empathy and sympathy.\n\n Here is the disagreement, you believe someone who bases his or her actions on logic instead of empathy must not have empathy.\n \n Empathy as far as I am concerned (via all my experiences with others) is merely the recognition that these human bodies you see walking all over the place are controlled by a conscious mind and have thought and emotion.\n \n If you feel emotion about evil or good in yourself, YOU MUST KNOW, that evil and good exists for others and you will then feel emotion about the good and evils of others.\n \n Allowing the unification of good and evil in general, which by the way is the premise that defeats subjectivism and is necessary for objective ethics.\n \n To say it simply: You get hurt you feel bad about it, someone else gets hurt you feel bad about it.\n \n Meaning: People getting hurt is bad and you feel bad about it.\n \n It's all perfectly rational for me (and I consider myself a rational person).\n \n I don't act according to logic despite empathy, empathy is a result of the law of non-contradiction. It is only logical to have empathy.\n \n What you want is empathy without reason just as you want emotion in general without reason.\n \n You want men to make connections with others and feel emotions about their fortunes but you don't want there to be a reason to feel emotion at all.\n \n The happiness or pain in an individual can't be caused by a rational thought so of course rational thought can't cause happiness or pain based off of others.\n \n You spoke above of a disturbing world, well that is disturbing to me. A world in which one must choose between logic/truth and emotion/instinct.\n \n It is literally tearing what constitutes a person in pieces and for what?\n \n \nThe theory isn't making predictions, it's creating definitions then.\n\n Ethics is a science and it may contain many theories.\n \n Ethics also defines the definitions of morality and immorality,\n \n Individual theories in ethics will make predictions about the morality of certain situations and be incorrect when they contradict the definitions.\n \n i.e. immorality consists of violating rights.\n \n Theory A predicts under certain circumstances action B is moral.\n \n Evidence is uncovered that proves action B is equivalent to the violation of rights theory A is disproved.\n \n Ethics is different to other sciences in that it's really quite easy to conduct, so easy that practically anyone can be expected to reach conclusions quickly.\n \n That the evidence is easily accessible, the definitions are clear, and every human on earth is in a very good position to analyze human action means this science is rather dull as far as a career not that it is not a real science.\n \n \nAny ethical theory can define an action as moral or immoral (in fact, that's sort of what they are supposed to do). The theory of gravity in your example predicts what an object will do, while your philosophy merely defines the behavior as moral or immoral.\n\n Everything rests on definitions.\n \n The theory of gravity predicts objects with masses experience a force as a function of other masses and the location of those masses.\n \n The definition of mass, force, location are all required for that theory to predict anything.\n \n The theory of gravitation in particular may not define those things but they must be defined scientifically, and one might say the theory of science does defines them.\n \n \nIn no way can this be called objective.\n\n On the unspoken premise that if something must be defined it cannot be objective.\n \n It does not follow.\n \n \nYes, since you assert all knowledge must be objective or it is not knowledge. The world delivered by our senses is not objective because our senses do not detect or record the world faithfully.\n\n They do.\n \nMy example of the actions of the eyes was merely an example of this.\n\n A failed example.\n \n Eyes detect patterns of light, malfunctioning eyes detect incorrect patterns of light.\n \n The failure to detect something does not mean it does not exist.\n \n The instant you try to apply this to any particular it's absurdness would become apparent.\n \n For example you walk in the park and see a bluejay flying.\n \n You can't see the other side of the bluejay and you can't see the inside of the bluejay yet you identified it as a bluejay.\n \n What are your eyes reporting? Nothing but shapes and colors.\n \n It is your mind that identifies.\n \n Is the existance of the bluejay objectivly unprovable because you do not sense every atom in it's body?\n \n What is required to say it is objectivly provable? Merely evidence that leaves no other conclusion. As with all other knowledge.\n \n A blind person can know a bluejay exists.\n \n A person with only one sense can know a bluejay exists. They merely cannot know the sense associated with the bluejay if they do not posses that sense.\n \n Language is built upon the objectivity of knowledge. A word means something and it means that thing for more people than just one.\n \n As soon as you define something you have set out the rules to tell if it exists or doesn't, it's properties.\n \n None of us can see in X-rays or observe another galaxy with the naked eye yet we construct machines which can and we look at the print outs that the machine produces and we say galaxies exist.\n \n You said we run a simulation of the world in our minds, we do not we identify the world and that is the world by the act of identification.\n \n A = A\n \n \nFight it? Current psychological theory denies objectivism. Evolutionary theory denies objectivism. Common sense denies objectivism.\n\n Given those as premises I conclude current psychological theory, evolutionary theory, common sense are all irrational.\n \n The conclusion is sound as none of those things are axiomatic but objectivism is based on two axioms.\n \n It is a good thing that I do not hold those premises as true.\n \nI have no need to fight against it.\n\n No one ever will, many will want to though.\n \nI'm trying to show you why it makes no sense.\n\n You are trying to use reason to show me why reason isn't the only source of knowledge?",

Descartes, the philosopher from whom you borrowed that quotation, discarded perception as unreliable and came to the conclusion that consciousness (the mind) is immaterial and not part of the material world. He posited that his sense's account of the external world has merit only because God, in his benevolence, did not desire to decieve him. His philosophy was dualistic.\n \n The philosophy inherent with the thinking behind that quotation denies materialism as foundation. Materialism denies the existence of free-will, for the reasons I've already mentioned. \n \n \n\n The failure to detect something does not mean it does not exist.\n \n You said we run a simulation of the world in our minds, we do not we identify the world and that is the world by the act of identification.\n \n For example you walk in the park and see a bluejay flying.\n \n You can't see the other side of the bluejay and you can't see the inside of the bluejay yet you identified it as a bluejay.\n\n \n You assume the blue-jay exists. A thousand times a thousand times a day your mind assumes objects exist or don't exist. Only most of the time is it right. Since our senses depend upon assumptions to build the simulation we experience as 'reality', our knowledge of the world could not be called objective by any stretch of the imagination.\n \n On empathy and sociopaths:\n \n\n I see, so behaving logically can never make you a sociopath?\n\n \n You may be laboring under a misunderstanding. Sociopaths aren't made, they're born. Emotions are part of the kit you're born with.\n \n \n\n Here is the disagreement, you believe someone who bases his or her actions on logic instead of empathy must not have empathy.\n\n \n No, I'm saying people generally don't base those types of actions on logic and instead base them upon empathy and sympathy.\n \n You say: To say it simply: You get hurt you feel bad about it, someone else gets hurt you feel bad about it. Meaning: People getting hurt is bad and you feel bad about it.\n \n That is exactly the point I have been making this entire time. People do not logically weigh the pros and cons of helping someone who is hurt as you were suggesting with your examples. Instead, when someone is hurt people generally feel bad about it and try to help them out of sympathy. Sociopaths may still help people, but they do it by weighing the pros and cons of the situation instead of helping out of sympathy and empathy. They do not have those emotions.\n \n On objective ethics:\n \n\n Individual theories in ethics will make predictions about the morality of certain situations and be incorrect when they contradict the definitions.\n \n Individual theories in ethics will make predictions about the morality of certain situations and be incorrect when they contradict the definitions.\n\n \n No, they make no predictions.

Neither can predict behavior, they just codify standards.\n \n How can a theory be incorrect about it's own definition? :P\n \n \n\n The theory of gravitation in particular may not define those things but they must be defined scientifically, and one might say the theory of science does defines them\n\n \n Indeed, science must define terms.

This generally means there is something wrong with the theory.\n \n Now let's say you construct a thought experiment about a situation and decide whether it is moral or immoral. Now if that situation occurs with no extra variables, is there any possible way for the morality in the real situation to deviate from the thought experiment? Heck, it doesn't even matter which ethical theory you used, the result would always be the same between the thought experiment and the real situation because no ethical theory makes predictions, they only define what is moral or immoral in a certain situation.\n \n \n\n You are trying to use reason to show me why reason isn't the only source of knowledge\n\n \n No, I'm showing you that your philosophy does not apply reason in its own construction.",

Your simulation? his simulation?\n \n I thought we were discarding perception so who's to tell? in fact I am only seeing shapes that look like words in the English language when I read your posts I am only assuming you exist right?\n \nSince our senses depend upon assumptions to build the simulation we experience as 'reality', our knowledge of the world could not be called objective by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n The 'assumptions' you speak of are the axioms of existance. When I first read Rand I wondered why she should bother to write down such obvious facts and after talking with a hundred such people as yourself I now know why.\n \n In this very post you deny the existance of objective knowledge yet without blinking an eye you previously told me that some various sciences contradicted my philosophy. What do you call this knowledge gained through science and why does it hold more validity than my whim or bias?\n \n \nYou may be laboring under a misunderstanding.

Meaning: People getting hurt is bad and you feel bad about it.\n\n \n \nThat is exactly the point I have been making this entire time. People do not logically weigh the pros and cons of helping someone who is hurt as you were suggesting with your examples.\n\n I do, others do. A human who is functioning properly will feel emotion about any event with significance to their life and values AND will never stop thinking logically.\n \n To illustrate this let me propose to you an example situation.\n \n A man is walking along and he see a burning building and someone tells him there are still people inside, at the exact same time a boy falls into nearby water and cannot swim. He are the only one there to help in either case.\n \n A healthy human being would feel emotions of fear (for the potential loss of value), empathy (integrating extended good and evil), sympathy (producing a negative feeling for the evil that is happening to others resulting in motivation to avert that evil and produce good).\n \n These emotions are a reflection of the values that person holds, he would not feel fear if he did not value others, he would not feel empathy if he did not recognize they were the same as him.\n \n In your world emotion is man and reason is a tool, in mine reason is man and emotions are tools.\n \n My view is correct because these emotions could not exist without beliefs.\n \n Now, his emotions have not told the man what to do, they have simply informed him that his existance is in peril just as pain does.\n \n He then weighs the chances of saving the people in the fire and saving the boy and his own life. He considers the pros and cons and he makes a decision that will avert the greatest amount of evil and produce the greatest good.\n \n This is not new to him he tries to do this with every decision he makes and he calls his failure to do this a mistake.\n \n Reason gives him action, it gave him purpose, and it gave him his emotions.\n \n The greatest sickness a man can be afflicted with is to denounce reason.\n \n A man cannot believe nothing but without reason something must be found to give belief, in that quest for something you will find every philosophies roots, except one.\n \n To say he acts from the emotions he feels instead of the values he holds is like saying that you press the gas at a intersection because you see a green light instead of knowing it's your turn to go.\n \n Now very few people say that they denounce reason or believe it themselves. They solve this contradiction by redefining reason.\n \n Reason becomes something useful for discovering the physical world but falls short in 'social' and 'spiritual' matters.\n \n They construct a wall from a very young age, on one side of this wall is thing that make sense and have to make sense. You are not allowed to say that 1+1 =3 because you feel it should be so. On the other side is things you are supposed to believe and do but you aren't allowed to try to make sense of it. You are allowed to say that Mary should help Kate because you feel it should be so.\n \n I do not think twice about letting logic free reign over my mind and in doing so I have found no wall between it and my soul.\n \n It is a wall of spider webs spun by the essence of non-thought.\n \n Some people go through life not bothering to notice the wall, others try to push at it and recoil without actually touching it concluding that man and the world is simply a big mystery, some discover it and reinforce it as best they can and try to build it up in others, some very sick few find it and try to expand the borders of the nonsensical side to include more and more of their minds.\n \n I want to tell you that you can tear it down at any moment by opening your mind.\n \n \nInstead, when someone is hurt people generally feel bad about it and try to help them out of sympathy.\n\n Why feel sympathy?\n \n Here is a question for you, why do you feel you should help yourself?\n \n \nSociopaths may still help people, but they do it by weighing the pros and cons of the situation instead of helping out of sympathy and empathy. \n\n Then I am a sociopath\n \nThey do not have those emotions.\n\n For that can be the only possible explanation for not holding emotion as the self-generating supreme attribute of man.....\n \n \nNo, they make no predictions. Your philosophy defines what is moral or immoral in certain situations just as the penal code defines what is legal or illegal. But they are both just conceptual constructs. Neither can predict behavior, they just codify standards.\n\n It defines the words yes, but it is not circular logic. The existance of these objects is the conclusion of axioms and their subsequent conclusions.\n \n You may have misunderstood objectivism however if you think that there is no corroborating evidence besides the primary deductive arguments.\n \n Arguments of induction can be made because one of the predictions of objective ethics is that a society which is more ethical will be more prosperous.\n \n \nHow can a theory be incorrect about it's own definition? :P\n \n Indeed, science must define terms. However, the predictions science makes is about behavior. \n\n No matter what variable you assign to a number in an equation the equation does not change, it is the same with definitions.\n \n You could play with them all day but so long as you remained consistent and follow the rules of logic you would not be able to prove something or establish something that was not a logical result.\n \n Is it a prediction of mathematics that A + B = C?\n \n It is so long as B = C - A\n \n But that wouldn't pass your standard of self definition would it? Is mathematics real for it certainly defines it's own terms and laws and makes predictions ONLY about the interactions between those terms.\n \n \nThink of it this way: A scientific experiement constructs an experiment to test a prediction a theory makes. It goes off without a hitch with no unknowns introduced to the system, but the result differs wildly from the prediction. This generally means there is something wrong with the theory.\n \n Now let's say you construct a thought experiment about a situation and decide whether it is moral or immoral. Now if that situation occurs with no extra variables, is there any possible way for the morality in the real situation to deviate from the thought experiment? Heck, it doesn't even matter which ethical theory you used, the result would always be the same between the thought experiment and the real situation because no ethical theory makes predictions, they only define what is moral or immoral in a certain situation.\n\n The support given for the ethical theory is not the predictions it makes but the premises it is based on.\n \n As I said before you are correct since the only way to determine if something is moral or immoral is via a theory of ethics if your theory is incorrect you will never get a 'third party' contradiction.\n \n That does not mean you cannot assemble a correct theory of ethics anymore than you cannot assemble a quadratic formula because anything that would disprove it is also mathematic in nature.\n \n \nNo, I'm showing you that your philosophy does not apply reason in its own construction.\n\n That is impossible, if I define objectivism as the philosophy of reason (and I have) then it cannot be unreasonable.\n \n Therefore you are trying to show me that my philosophy isn't objectivist.\n \n \nIn a purely material universe, consciousness is an epiphenomenon that is an emergent property of matter in motion that operates according to cause and effect. With no immaterial consciousness directing actions (since the immaterial does not exist in materialism), waking souls would then be slaves in denial, essentially, since something else sets the body in motion with only a summary being sent to the homunculus behind your eyes.

   "take from your sentence is that you don't wish me to abandon reason.\n\n \n Ah, but then you would have to abandon your philosophy :P\n \n I'm trying to cut post length. If you want something addressed and it isn't, please point it out.\n \n On consciousness:\n \n\n Now as a life form materially I am the sum of physical reactions caused by the information in my DNA, by your own premise anything that I am is merely the result of that chain of events.\n \n If that is the case then any difference between us is merely the difference in our respective chains.\n [...]\n The mind is not immaterial because it can be detected by material science, i.e. it can be proven to exist.\n [...]\n I fail to see your point unless you are citing Descartes as infallible.\n [...]\n As I said before you failed to state some premises that your argument required and you have not yet included and defended them\n [...]\n and what is 'right'? Your simulation? his simulation?\n \n\n \n Consciousness cannot be cut or divided in three dimensions, or directly measured by material science\n \n You cited Descarte's conclusions. You now seem to be saying you agree with his conclusions but not his thinking. Do tell! How do you separate them? I have included all the reasoning needed to show that materialism denies free will. You weren't able to understand that reasoning, so it was simplified. That you could not understand it does not mean I did not supply it.\n \n I do assume a reality exists beyond our simulations (not all philsophies assume there is anything beyond the simulations). The various sciences work diligently to remove the assumptions our brain makes from their work. That work is the closest we can come to objective knowledge. However, that knowledge is not simply delivered to us by our senses, which is my point.\n \n You seem to be assuming that we just open our eyes and apprehend reality, as if perception were a window through which our selves gaze at the world. This is called naive realism, and it was refuted by skeptical philosophers thousands of years ago with visual illusions. Our senses are gadgets, not pipelines to truth.\n \n \n\n The 'assumptions' you speak of are the axioms of existance\n\n \n No, the assumptions I speak of are the intuitions we are born with or assumptions that our brain intrinsically make. They include:\n \n -An intuitive physics, which we use to keep track of how objects fall, bounce, and bend. its core intuition is the concept of the object, which occupies one place, exists for a continuous span of time, and follows laws of motion and force (not Newtonian laws, but something closer to the medieval conception of impetus).\n -An intuitive version of biology, which we use to understand the living world. Its core intuition is that living things house a hidden essence that gives them their form and powers and drives their growth and bodily functions.\n -An intuitive engineering, which we use to make and understand tools and other artifacts. its core intuition is that a tool is an object with a purpose.\n -An intuitive psychology, which we use to understand other people. Its core intuition is that other people are not objects or machines but are animated by the invisible entity we call the mind or the soul. Minds contain beliefs and desires and are the immediate cause of behavior\n \n Other components are difficult to distinguish from our emotional modules. There is a system for assessing danger coupled with fear, for assessing contamination coupled with disgust and a moral sense, which we have already discussed. There are many more intuitive faculties as well and include an intuition about language, economics, mental databases, spatial sense, a sense of probability and numbers, and more.\n \n These components are suitable for a lifestyle of small groups of illiterate, stateless people who live off the land, survive by their wits and depend on what they can carry. This is the lifestyle that we evolved and our brains evolved to survive in, too recently for evolution to have changed much, if anything, about how our brain works. If you accept evolution, it is a foregone conclusion that our brains must have evolved as well.\n \n On sociopaths (or rather: psychopathy might be more accurate to what I am describing. I apologize for the confusion):\n \n\n I didn't mean to say otherwise, I am looking for how you would tell the difference externally from someone who behaved perfectly logically and a sociopath.\n \n A false dichotomy, logic is not exclusive to empathy or sympathy.\n [...]\n Then I am a sociopath\n\n \n You are laboring under a misconception. I did not say that people cannot be logical if they have emotions. I said that people generally don't weigh the pros and cons of the simple situations you describe. Not cannot, but do not. When someone is hurt, people generally feel bad and help out of sympathy and empathy. Certainly their methods may be the result of weighing advantage vs disadvantage, but their motivation is their emotional response.\n \n Yes, someone who behaves as if they have no emotions could be indistinguishable from someone who genuinely does not have a conscience. This is similar to a psychopath, who does not have emotional reactions but behaves as if he does. They are often indistinguishable, because we assume other people have the emotions when they behave as if they do.\n \n And yes, I do get the impression you are a psychopath, from your description of your decision-making processes. You may not be alone, there are many people, including successful people, who may very well have this condition. How would the rest of us tell the difference between just a ruthless businessman or a psychopath? The ones we catch are the ones who decide not to fit in, and even the ones we catch are superficially charming enough to con people into lobbying for their release (and subsequently kill again).\n \n On emotions:\n \n\n In your world emotion is man and reason is a tool, in mine reason is man and emotions are tools\n \n My view is correct because these emotions could not exist without beliefs\n\n \n You've just reinforced my point, and directly contradicted your own. In your example, the knowledge of the situation evoked an emotional response which drives the mans actions. Certainly he used reason to determine how to save the people or if it is even feasible, but he used reason as a tool to fulfill his purpose which is driven by emotion. To say that emotions are a tool is somewhat bizarre since our reasoning we can put to a purpose, but emotions are under very limited control. We cannot consciously, usually, use emotions for a specific purpose. Reason is a tool we use, then, while emotions are intrinsic to how we interact with the world.\n \n Emotional reactions and beliefs are not separate with one depending on the other as you assert. The 'beliefs' that you describe are not beliefs as we commonly use the term (since they are not consciously held), and are not the result of conscious reasoning but are intuitively derived by our moral sense (using other gadgets such as kin detectors and so on), which also drives our emotional response. To say that one depends on the other is a wrongheaded way of seeing the relationship since they are, in a sense, aspects of the same thing. \n \n On objective ethics:\n \n\n Arguments of induction can be made because one of the predictions of objective ethics is that a society which is more ethical will be more prosperous.\n\n \n Not really a prediction since there is no causality between the two. At best you would be confusing correlation and causation.\n \n \n\n You could play with them all day but so long as you remained consistent and follow the rules of logic you would not be able to prove something or establish something that was not a logical result.\n \n Is it a prediction of mathematics that A + B = C?\n \n It is so long as B = C - A\n \n But that wouldn't pass your standard of self definition would it? Is mathematics real for it certainly defines it's own terms and laws and makes predictions ONLY about the interactions between those terms.\n\n \n Actually no, it is not real in terms of being truth. It is merely, so far, consistent. It is perfectly possible to form a completely different mathematical set of rules that are self-consistent. Arithmetics is a formal system that also contains axioms that are not truth, they just inform the system. After we have explored a given formal system for a long time we may feel very confident that it is consistent but, needless to say, zillions of contradiction-free theorems don't constitute a proof of consistency. Our confidence in this or any other formal system is necessarily based on an incomplete induction. It's always possible that a given formal system could exhibit an inconsistency at some point. In fact, it's been suggested that every formal system, if pressed far enough, is inconsistent.\n \n Regarding the contrast between physical theories and mathematical theories, note that a physical theory such as Newtonian mechanics can also be construed reductively as a purely mathematical theory, and as such it may be internally consistent, even if its physical validity is in doubt. \n \n Still, a physical theory is by definition a theory of knowledge that associates some of its elements with observable quantities. That identification is part of the theory, and is what makes it a physical rather than a purely mathematical theory. Newtonian mechanics, interpreted as a physical theory, does assert a correspondence between its elements and certain measureable quantities, and in this sense it fails (as a physical theory, not necessarily as mathematical theory) when pressed to extremes of relative velocities. Whether it also fails at some point as a purely mathematical theory is a separate (and interesting) question. Mathematics is not part of the physical world. It defines what is true only about itself, not about the physical world. It is a conceptual set of rules that we use as a tool.\n \n On choice:\n \n\n Again you do not explicitly state the premise: Consciousness must be immaterial to have choice.\n \n Why do you think this? Why do you think the immaterial exists?\n\n \n It is the only logical answer. It is the same conclusion Descarte's reached when he proclaimed \"I think therefore I am\".\n \n \n\n Since the immaterial cannot exist and we do have choice, choice is possible to a material consciousness.\n\n \n Again, in a materialistic world any state is the physical result of the previous state of matter; it is a deterministic universe. The brain, then, is just matter in motion and if that is true then consciousness must be an epiphenomenon. In that case, there is no method for consciousness to direct any actions. There are no choices to be made, therefore the experience of choosing is an illusion. \n \n If the immaterial does not exist, choice is not possible.",

   "Deciding things for yourself based on the emergent properties of your brain doesn't make you a \"slave\". Certainly no more a slave than if you were being pushed around by a soul you had no control over.\n\n \n \"You\" are the immaterial consciousness so you are only pushed around by yourself (and therefore not pushed around at all). If consciousness is an epiphenomenon then \"you\" would be a misjudgement impressed upon you and sustained by brain molecules in motion.\n \n Don't forget that sleepwalkers converse, drive vehicles, commit crimes and clean up afterward, unconscious the whole time. Only waking souls would think they direct those actions, but are just slaves in denial along for the ride.\n \n \n\n What do you mean \"something else\"? The \"something else\" is your brain. There is no \"homunculus\" behind your eyes that's distinct from the rest of your brain, as there would be if you had both a material brain and an immaterial soul behind the wheel.\n\n \n Life requires us to adopt dualism, at least in our actions. We move thoughts by thinking, we move matter with other bits of matter. Matter is what we call those bits we don't control with our thoughts alone. If everything were matter, everything would be inanimate and there would be no deliberate action. If everything were thought, everything would be omnipotent and perfectly tranquil, for there would be no need for action. Logic says there must be one underlying reality, a nexus of cause and effect where final cause relates to mechanical cause. This nexus cannot be investigated by introspection alone because it is not only made of thought. It cannot be investigated by material science alone because it is not only made of matter.\n \n As a point of fact, you do have a whole other self buried below the limbic system, below the hindbrain and below even the cerebellum. It lives in the brain stem and it is older than vertebrates themselves. It is self-contained: it hears and sees and feels, independent of all the other parts layered on top of it. It dwells on nothing but its own survival. It has no time for planning or abstract analysis, spares effort for only rudimentary sensory processing. But it's fast and it's dedicated, it can respond to threats in the fraction of the time it takes your consciousness to be aware of it. In cases such as blindsight it can even inform your mind of where objects are in space. Your brain has other gauges that your mind reads, which is shown by a whole host of dysfunctions that affect your brain and misinforms the mind. Somnambulism, Agnosias, Hemineglect. A woman dying of thirst within easy reach of water not because she could not see it but because she could not recognize it. A man for whom the left side of the world does not exist, where the concept of leftness had become unthinkable. The opposite of blindsight where the blind insist they can see, where the brains representation of the world is intact but fails to refresh and the mind cannot tell the difference. The retinas are detached, optic nerves burned away, where vision is impossible by the laws of physics. Gauges even for existence, such as in Cotard's syndrome, where the brain informs the mind that it no longer exists. These show a separation between mind and brain, even though there is (and must be) a link between them.\n \n \n\n The method is physics.\n\n \n It is a fact that consciousness is not directly measurable. It cannot be cut or divided in three dimensions, or detected by material science. It is immaterial by definition. The crux is really whether consciousness is an epiphenomenon where our experience of 'choice' is an illusion since all actions are a result of previous states of matter (in this paradigm the immaterial is in denial about whether it guides actions) or whether the immaterial can affect the material and the will guides actions instead of physics alone.\n \n If consciousness is a result of matter in motion operating according to cause and effect, then physics is what causes the action, not any decision on your part. Materialism is deterministic. Choice is illusionary in that paradigm.",

Even those who cannot \"apprehend\" the visual world (as in, be conscious of it), as in the case of blindsight, can guide their hand to where they \"feel\" a spot on the wall is being projected. This is because our brain creates a representation of the world using data from our senses, and our conscious mind creates a meta-representation of that representation. Our blindsight patient has a representation of the spot on the wall, but no representation of that representation; no qualia in other words. The converse of this, called Anton's syndrome, where the blind insist they can see, shows that a metarepresentation is intact but no primary representation exists since sight is denied them by the laws of physics. The metarepresentation simply fails to refresh.\n \n When we open our eyes a series of complicated systems begin working, but we have no conscious and direct access to what our senses take in. Being aware of sensation is an oxymoron because awareness doesn't mean anything without that metarepresentation. You have to be aware that you are aware, otherwise you are not aware.\n \n \n\n I'll just restructure the view of man to fit in with this model, wait why should I have to if it's true and I am a man?\n \n Well you clearly seem to have forgotten the basic intuition to ignore the existence of the rest of the intuitions and think something ridiculous like thinking is thought and logic is not intuition but the singular and unique ability to emulate and predict reality with thought as opposed to triggered behavior.\n\n \n Well, yes, human's have the unique (thought to be unique, at least) ability to model behavior in our minds for predictive and other purposes. When asked to pretend to use a hammer on a nail, most of us can perform this behavior flawlessly. Emulation is not unique to humans, of course, but it is essential to our species.\n \n However, it is incorrect to assume that these are not functions of the brain that are as instinctual as our emotional responses. Perfectly functional people, intelligent in all respects, who suffer from the condition called ideomotor apraxia cannot perform the simple test of \"pretend to use a hammer\". Sufferers would instead make a fist and flail at the tabletop, even though they understood the instruction and are not mentally deficient. \n \n Emulation is actually just a further function of this model-making ability of our brains. The virtual reality simulation we construct must be useful so we can act upon it, so this simulation must contain models of other people's minds so we can detect intention and predict behavior of others (called \"the theory of other minds\"). To be complete, this model must contain a model of itself, of its own stable attributes and personality and the limits of its abilities. To exemplify this, imagine a newborn baby mimicing its parents. Stick your tongue out and the baby will stick its tongue out as well. It's an astonishing ability, given that it can't even see its own tongue. It must create an internal model of your behavior and then re-enact it in its own brain. This ability is governed by a specific set of neurons called \"mirror neurons\". Autistic children are thought to be unable to construct this \"theory of other minds\" and lack empathy.\n \n These functions are part of the brain that evolved with the rest of us.\n \n \n\n Is acting perfectly logical equivalent to acting as if one does not have emotions?\n\n \n I specifically said that someone with no emotions can behave identically to someone with an emotional response, so how someone acts is not an indication of anything. The internal decision-making can be driven by either and can reach the same conclusion.\n \n \nThen you misunderstood the example.\n \n We cannot consciously invoke or banish pain but it is a tool for our survival.\n\n \n Yes, but not a consciously used one. Nor are emotions. You said: In your world emotion is man and reason is a tool, in mine reason is man and emotions are tools\n \n Both reason and emotions (including pain) are tools for survival, yet only reason can be consciously employed as a tool. Emotions, then, are more intrinsic to our being, the motivation to use our reason for a purpose.\n \n Your example reinforces that view.\n \n \nThey are not commonly consciously held, they ought to be, I keep them consciously.\n \n The reason most people don't is because our culture and most cultures have been infected by collectivism, perspectivism, and nihilism to some degree. What we call great men are often those who did know consciously what their beliefs were and the subsequent trust that they were correct led to their unique conviction and will.\n\n \n Whatever the reason, they are not beliefs as we commonly use the term. What you described is another aspect of emotional responses.\n \n \nI haven't broken out my kin detector in a while, it's getting dusty...\n\n \n You use it constantly, unless you engage in incest. The reason most people feel it's \"icky\" is due to the kin detection ability of our brains evoking an emotional response for the purpose of incest prevention.\n \n \nNon-contradiction = consistency\n\n \n Consistency does not mean anything except that it is consistent. It certainly does not mean something is a physical theory, as seen in my explanation.\n \n Any ethical theory can be consistent.

You said: In your world emotion is man and reason is a tool, in mine reason is man and emotions are tools\n\n That is what I said on both counts.\n \nBoth reason and emotions (including pain) are tools for survival, yet only reason can be consciously employed as a tool. Emotions, then, are more intrinsic to our being, the motivation to use our reason for a purpose.\n\n Belief causes emotion and in a healthy person reason causes belief. In me (and other healthy persons) emotion does not cause belief. It is obviously a consequent and therefore cannot be more intrinsic to our being.\n \n \nConsistency does not mean anything except that it is consistent.\n\n Non-contradiction = consistency\n \n \nAny ethical theory can be consistent. So, then, I have shown that there doesn't appear to be a method for your philosophy to be \"objective\".\n\n Uh huh, why don't you put that argument in standard form.\n \n\n Were you planning on answering the point?\n\n No.\n \n \nNo, it was a conclusion. The sentence begain with \"In that case\" implying an \"if... then\" type relationship.\n\n The bolded part was the statement was where you used it, in an argument you use premises to come to a conclusion.\n \n So you just said \"No, it was a conclusion.\" to me saying \"this is the conclusion you used it for\"\n \n The premise is asserted but not stated when you move from epiphenomenon to \"if so then no choice\"\n \n Now tell me how can you go from \"the result of matter in motion\" and therefore an epiphenomenon (which in this case can only be interpreted as \"the result of the sum\") to \"no choice\"?\n \n It is absurd, and I can give you and example besides people.",

   "The existance of everything.\n\n \n You seem to be saying nothing in existance can be measured in three dimensions. That seems to be an absurd notion, though. Maybe you could clarify?\n \n \n\n I am making a list of this you know that right?\n\n \n You're making an assertion about sight, and I'm telling you that you're wrong about how our senses and how the mind works. Consciousness is much more complicated than you seem to think it is.\n \n We do not just \"open our eyes and apprehend patterns of light\". Visual processing runs from the rods and cones in the retina, through intermediate levels representing edges, depths and surfaces, to recognition of the object in front of us. We are unaware of the lowest levels of sensation, or the highest: we do not spend our lives in Proustian contemplation of every crumb of the madeleine and every nuance of the decoction of lime flowers. We literally cannot see the lightness of the coal in the sun, the darkness of the snowball inside, the pale green-gray of the \"black\" areas on the television screen, or the rubbery parallelograms that a moving square projects on our retinas.\n \n What we \"see\" is a highly processed product. The surfaces of objects, their intrinsic colors and textures, and their depths, slants and tilts. It is the same with our other senses as well. Our senses are not, in any sense, pipelines to truth.\n \n \n\n Answer the question.\n\n \n I thought I had. Rational outcomes come from both emotional motivations (since that is their purpose) and also zombies who emotionlessly assess the situation. An outside observer would probably not be able to tell the difference. If I told you that I am not sentient, and am in fact an emotionless zombie, you would not be able to debunk it.\n \n To wit: simplistically, we not only register events but register them as pleasurable or painful, desirable or undesirable. That makes us take steps to have more of the former and less of the latter, now and in the future. Evolutionarily speaking, there is seldom any mystery why we would seek the goals we seek -- why, for example, people would rather make love with an attractive partner rather than get a slap on the belly with a wet fish. The things that become objects of desire are the kinds of things that led, on average, to enhanced odds of survival and reproduction in the environment in which we evolved. \n \n Could you rephrase the question? I might have more luck then.\n \n \n\n That is what I said on both counts.\n \n Belief causes emotion and in a healthy person reason causes belief. In me (and other healthy persons) emotion does not cause belief. It is obviously a consequent and therefore cannot be more intrinsic to our being.\n\n \n Your causal chain has reason causing emotion. This does not seem to be the case in reality. Reason doesn't make you lust after an attractive partner, or to love a child. There can be rational reasons to do these things, but you didn't reason them out and then have the emotional response.\n \n Neither would emotional reactions be all socially constructed, otherwise infants would have no emotions.\n \n \n\n Non-contradiction = consistency\n \n Uh huh, why don't you put that argument in standard form.\n\n \n Which any ethical theory may possess. That does not make any ethical theory objective (that is, a physical theory).\n \n \n\n Now tell me how can you go from \"the result of matter in motion\" and therefore an epiphenomenon (which in this case can only be interpreted as \"the result of the sum\") to \"no choice\"?\n \n It is absurd, and I can give you and example besides people.\n\n \n Please give examples :)\n \n I put forth the explanation already, but I'll try to put it another way if I can. If the universe is solely a result of matter in motion operating according to cause and effect, then every state of matter is predictable if one knows the previous state of all matter. Therefore your actions are, theoretically, perfectly predictable from the moment the universe is born, since the current state of matter (including yourself), is merely the result of the inescapable previous state. This is not compatible with the notion of choice, or free will.\n \n Julius Caesar would then be wrong when he said:Men at some time are masters of their fates:\n The fault, dear brutus, lies not in our stars,\n But in ourselves...\n We would not find someone guilty if his finger pulled the trigger when it was mechanically connected to a roulette wheel since he would not be thought to have the free will necessary to pull the trigger, so why would it be any different if the mechanical roulette wheel was the size of the universe? The mechanical mode of explanation cannot accommodate the mysterious notion of uncaused causation that underlies free will. If you think quantum uncertainty would give it back, you'd be mistaken. Random neural events that amplify into a signal triggering behavior doesn't fit our notion of free will any more than a lawful ones do.\n \n In this paradigm, our consciousness, which gives us the experience of free will, would be an epiphenomenom (meaning: a secondary phenomenom) imposed upon us by matter in motion. An illusion of choice where choice is impossible. Your consciousness mistakes correlation for causation: it reads the body's summary and sees the hand move, and it thinks that one drove the other.",

It is a sum of all the electronic potentials across it's boards.\n \n It has not metaphysical spirit nor any other discernible pattern of unexplainable existance.\n \n Yet it makes choices.\n \n In computer languages IF THEN, is the primary definition of a choice for a program.\n \n Perhaps if you defined freewill as needing to be some kind of transcendent whim it could not be material.\n \n I do not, free will is our ability to choose what actions we take, all that requires is the ability to make choices and the choice to form the functions that we exercise when making choices.\n \n A circular system of deterministic updates well accounts for the concept of freewill in my opinion.\n \n Only be assuming you are something other than this 'program' can you consider yourself a slave to it's edicts.",
