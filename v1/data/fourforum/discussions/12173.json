When you get around to proposing the \"fool proof\" method by which you will achieve this gun free utopia you appear to desire, then I'll happily respond and consider it.\n \n This entire exercise of dreaming up a nebulous \"fool proof way to eliminate all guns\" was nothing more than an attempt to justify your desire to call those who disagree with you \"sub-human,\" devils incarnate,\" \"depraved monsters,\" \"moral lepers,\" and persons \"unworthy to be called a true human being.\" (did I miss any of your insults?)\n \n But blind bigotry and insults are poor substitutes for rational arguments, my friend, and I would be wary of the fruit of the grape you consume-buzzed blogging is drunk blogging.\n \n I pray, oh enlightened one, that as you sit on distant Olympus and watch with pleasure the daily consumption of the livers of the \"depraved monsters\" who dared disagree with you, that you will choose to ignore and leave unpunished a mere mortal who dares not accept your claim of superior moral wisdom.\n \n But then again your name implies you understand Japanese and that you claim some connection to one or more of the seven sisters which the Greeks called the Pleiades, and it might be from this starry height that you intend to watch the daily torment of those deemed lesser beings for refusing to bow to your wisdom. I only ask-no matter where it is that you sit dreaming visions of the extreme discomfort of your doubters-that you spare me the lightning for my disbelief. \n \n And what am I to make of the desire to de-humanize others which you so willingly expose by the choice of title for this fantasy thread of yours? \n \n Gun nuts: human or sub-human?\n \n One need only substitute the word \"Jews\" for \"Gun Nuts\" to hear the echo of Dr. Goebbels pounding his fist on the orator's podium-a sound we had thought lost to a dark and condemned past.\n \n And yes-I say this to my other friends on both sides of the issues who post here-I willingly plead guilty to just encroaching upon a long recognized rule of blogging here (those who know the rule will understand what I am talking about). In mitigation I merely claim the exception that the rule should only apply in responding to those who deserve to be taken seriously.\n \n Now to return to you-my friend-who authored this thread: Please don't take offense at what I have said. This is all intended to be tongue-in-cheek. I'm just having a little innocent fun at your expense. \n \n When you are ready for a serious discussion of the issues involving gun control, then I'll happily engage you and give you all the measure of respect your future posts deserve. \n \n ---\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent.

Since guns have been outlawed there, it must be the safest place in the world. \n \n Can you show me the actual statistics for violent crime in the UK for the past ten years? I'm sure it drops off to almost nothing, right? After all, all the guns are gone. I'm sure the amount of stabbings has dropped as well. We all know that when the guns are all outlawed, all the violence stops. Just like it has in Chicago and D.C. (where guns have been 100% illegal for the past 30 years.)\n We all know that nobody would ever get shot in Chicago in a dark alley. Right? After all, guns are illegal there. \n \n I bet we don't hear anything in reply about Chicago. Anti-gunners are notorious subject changers on this big red flag that nobody seems to see. Either a subject change, or something about doing more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. (Which is a subtle obfuscation because I thought gun bans were supposed to do exactly that.)\n\n \n As you are new, search on Iangb for multiple stats on the topic.",

Only in rare instances would a smaller nation have a higher rate of crime. In some cases there is also the cultural differences we have to take into account. Just because it works in GB doesn't mean it would work in the USA. I think that prohibition showed us how well that works out (bans that is).

The problem is that there is no such method, and even if there is, perfect elimination of firearm ownership is not the answer.\n \n So would you say that all who acknowledge this are sub-human monsters?\n \n \nEven under such an extreme condition, they would still clutch their penis-substitutes,\n\n \n The macho argument has no appeal.

You are all welcome to visit and even stay a while.\n \n ---\n \n And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim. Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)\n \n The law allows arms to be taken against an armed foe. Ovid, 2 Ovid p. 152-53 (J. Mozley, Trans. 1969).\n \n If a slave, says Plato, defends himself, and kills a freeman, he ought to be treated as a parricide. This is a civil law which punishes self-defense, though dictated by nature. . . .\n It is unreasonable. . .to oblige a man not to attempt the defense of his own life. . . . .\n Who does not see that self-defense is a duty superior to every precept. . . .\n [T]he laws of an Italian republic [Venice], where bearing fire-arms is punished as a capital crime and where it is not more fatal to make an ill use of them than to carry them, is not agreeable to the nature of things. . . . Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, pp. 59, 60, 64, and 79-80 (trans. T. Nugent, 1899).\n \n The Court instructs the jury that when a person reasonably apprehends that another intends to attack him for the purpose of doing him serious bodily harm, then such person has the right to arm himself for his own necessary self defense and if he has reasonable grounds to believe that an attack will be made upon him then no inference of malice can be drawn from the fact of such preparation.-Virginia Model Jury Instruction.",

   "Robert Frost said:\n \n \"Education is the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper or your self-confidence.\"\n\n \n Practice what you preach.\n \n \nI make no apologies for my language. I am not really very interested in whether hominid apes have firearms or not. The pros and cons depend very much on the character of the people, social circumstances and, of course, cui bono. The Swiss manage firearms very well; Americans (as with so much else) make a mess of it.\n\n \n I don't know how you conclude that we live in such a bad place, but I can tell you that whatever you're hearing is not much more than propaganda. Maybe if you actually lived in the US...\n \n However it would not surprise me if you took the previous statement as ignorance that my government intends too keep me in. Would you take it that way? If so, then you sound like a conspiracy theorist to me.\n \n You also must consider that until Heller vs. DC, there was no legitamite way for a civilian to own any firearm what soever. It is equally as interesting to note that they had the highest firearm death rate in the United States, which not only hints that removal of firearms doesn't help crime, but also that gun laws in the United states are too diverse. I say we should use federal laws to regulate firearms.\n \n \nWhat I find most interesting about American gun-freaks is their rigidity of thinking, violence of expression, paranoia and hysteria, and their inability to budge from preconceived notions. Americans pride themselves on their ability to compromise, but I know very well that in America it is a virtue more honored in the breach than in the observance.\n\n \n Hmm, does this bring back memories to you? Would \"Education is the ability to sten to almost anything without losing your temper or your self-confidence.\" be a good example? \n \n What I wonder is how you know that America is such a horrible place. Was it the propaganda? Did the voices tell you that? I have no idea how you conclude that I have rigid thinking, violence of expression, paranoia and hysteria, and an inability to budge from preconceived notions. Have I hinted at such a thing during your time here?\n \n What I really dislike is your generalization of American gun-owners as your corrupted and exaggerated idea of a stereotype. You make it sound as if a person is sure to act differently than everyone else for the mere fact that they own a firearm. I can assure you that this is not true.\n \n \nYou were the only poster who responded in a human and decent manner. With all due respect, I cannot accept that \"most of the people on your side here believe the same as you.\" I have often noted (and been disgusted) that so many gun-freaks would rather see their country go to wrack and ruin rather than budge an inch in defending their little hobby.\n\n \n Belief and patience are two different things. And you make it very difficult for people to be patient with you. However, perhaps you would get more kind responses if you didn't refer to your opponents as \"gun-freaks\" and \"garbage-apes.\" A salesman will never convince a customer to buy a product by saying that he's stupid for not buying it. \n \n \nI think that I have been successful in exposing the twisted and degenerate minds of the gun-freaks to the scrutiny (and disgust) of normal people. Such was my only goal.\n \n -\n\n \n I think otherwise. We have successfully refuted your claims, yet you continue to parrot them as if we never said anything; as if we did nothing but acknowledge your presence.",

   "Criticize anything you like about me. Long ago I decided that a reasonable adult has only two reactions to criticism: if the criticism is correct, to thank the critic; if the criticism is false, to be indifferent to it.\n \n I must respectfully decline your offer of a debate on gun laws. It appears from your postings here that you have only a single bee in your bonnet. As I have said, I am fairly indifferent to gun laws: if Americans frame them, whatever they may be, they are bound to be stupid.\n \n I would be open to a somewhat broader debate, defending the good doctor Freud's thesis that \"America is a mistake --- a gigantic mistake!\" I have already started a thread tending in that direction, but, so far, there are no takers to defend the opposite view.\n \n -\n\n \n Oh never fear, my friend. The criticism was going to be more like advice-something on the lines of board up your own glass house before you denigrate others for spelling errors. \n \n If there are, as you say, only two ways for reasonable adults to react to criticism, then I must ask why have you declined to follow either? To my knowledge you have not admitted that any criticism aimed at you in this thread is correct, and yet you are anything but indifferent to it. Do all of your responses to your critics indicate that you are not acting like a reasonable adult, or is there some third way to respond?\n \n I ask this because I believe there is. A reasonable adult is capable of seeing the anger, the hatred, and the unhappiness you expose-and a reasonable adult might invite you to debate him so that he might expose your thoughts further to see whether or not these emotions are the product of rational thought. \n \n Your view of your own self worth should not be so great that disagreement becomes the wellspring of hatred and contempt, my friend. \n \n I have entered the debate arena with many people here who disagree with me. I regularly disagree with-to name a few-Penfold, Galileo, Chester, IanGB (I can't remember everyone, but these being more recent come easily to mind). They are all capable of having at times strong disagreements with me while remaining civil. I view this as the response of reasonable adults, and I try to remain civil with them in return. I enjoy the give and take of our discussions, and in doing so I also find things we do agree upon. \n \n Oh, there are others whom I need not name, whose purpose here is to snipe at the opposition, to post things which can be disproven, and who run when challenged. My tone with them is typically far more abrupt. And I may not play the reasonable adult when I respond to them, but as I have said before I do not suffer fools gladly. \n \n Now my first contact with you was in this thread. You walked into this thread like Christ come to cleanse the temple-with an \"I am the Way\" tone which accused any who dared disagree with you to be sub-human monsters. I thought to myself this must be a joke-no sane person would dare make such a claim. That's why I responded tongue-in-cheek. But you have continued this claim of moral superiority, and you quickly declared victory without even entering the arena. \n \n I invited you to engage me because I still wondered whether you had anything to offer. \n \n In event, thank you for responding to my offer. I disagree with your opinion that I only have one bee in my bonnet. I believe I have several to offer, but I understand you have declined to find out. It may be too late to say this as a method of tempting you to reconsider, but no matter how many bees I do or do not have you my friend have nothing to fear. This is blogging, after all, and it is only the ego which feels the sting.\n \n Although there are likely things within the broad topic of your Freudian quote we could agree upon, I feel I must decline to engage you here in a debate on that topic. This is a GC forum, and it is generally considered bad taste to hijack it in the pursuit of unrelated topics. But I'll tell you what-I'll agree to find the proper forum to have that discussion with you-IF you will agree to stop being the wandering critic here and get onto the field with me on the issue of GC.\n \n ---\n \n \"It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.\" Theodore Roosevelt, \"Citizenship in a Republic,\" Speech at the Sorbonne, Paris, April 23, 1910.",

The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a\n firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for\n traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.\n Pp. 2-53.\n (a) The Amendment's prefatory clause announces a purpose, but\n does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative\n clause. The operative clause's text and history demonstrate that it\n connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2-22.\n (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court's interpretation\n of the operative clause. The \"militia\" comprised all males physically\n capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists\n feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in\n order to disable this citizens' militia, enabling a politicized standing\n army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress\n power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear\n arms, so that the ideal of a citizens' militia would be preserved.\n Pp. 22-28.\n (c) The Court's interpretation is confirmed by analogous armsbearing\n rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately\n followed the Second Amendment.",

   "Did they have no reason to insert these words, or, being the careful wordsmiths they were, did they intend a meaning?\n\n \n The framers most certainly had a reason to include all the words that we find in the 2nd. What you obviously do not understand is the simple, fundamental principle of pre-existing rights. Since the right to arms is pre-existing and since no power was ever granted to the government to impact the private arms of the citizens, the words of the 2nd have zero impact or import upon the individual right of the citizen to keep and bear arms.\n \n The right exists without reference to the Amendment or the Constitution, thus the words merely chosen to (a),explain a reason why the pre-existing right was being secured and then (b), to actually secure the right, can not be \"interpreted\" to qualify, constrain, or condition the individual citizen's right to arms. \n \n SCOTUS explains quite succinctly this principle of pre-existing rights and their special condition of not being \"created\" or \"granted\" by the Constitution (or Bill of Rights) thus not being dependent upon those instruments for the existence of the right . See U S v. CRUIKSHANK, 92 U.S. 542 (1875). The Court first discusses the right to assemble then turns to the right of \"bearing arms for lawful purpose:\"\n [pg551]\"The first and ninth counts state the intent of the defendants to have been to hinder and prevent the citizens named in the free exercise and enjoyment of their\n \"lawful right and privilege to peaceably assemble together with each other and with other citizens of the United States for a peaceful and lawful purpose.\"\n The right of the people peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes existed long before the adoption of the Constitution of the United States. In fact, it is, and always has been, one of the attributes of citizenship under a free government. . . . It is found wherever civilization exists. It was not, therefore, a right granted to the people by the Constitution. The Government of the United States, when established, found it in existence, . . . [pg552]The particular amendment now under consideration assumes the existence of the right of the people to assemble for lawful purposes, and protects it against encroachment by Congress. The right was not created by the amendment; neither was its continuance guaranteed, except as against congressional interference. . . .\n \n [pg553] The second and tenth counts are equally defective. The right there specified is that of \"bearing arms for a lawful purpose.\" This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed, but this, as has been seen, means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress. This is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government, . . . \"Please explain how rights can exist without reference to the provisions that secure them but then somehow those provisions can be interpreted to constrain, qualify and condition the right.",

   "What comic books are you getting this stuff from?\n \n British monarchs have been bound hand and foot ever since the Glorious Revolution of 1688!\n \n Why don't you occasionally get off your soapbox and read some real history!\n \n The American Terrorist Insurrection of 1776 was concocted and led by the scum of the earth! (Boston Mafioso John Hancock, Virginia real estate speculator George Washington, etc.)\n \n -\n\n \n \n ALthough victory was still very much in doubt when this was published:\n \n DECLARATION OF THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF TAKING UP ARMS (July 6, 1775). (Second Continental Congress) (full text--bold highlights by Bryan)\n \n If it was possible for men, who exercise their reason to believe, that the divine Author of our existence intended a part of the human race to hold an absolute property in, and an unbounded power over others, marked out by his infinite goodness and wisdom, as the objects of a legal domination never rightfully resistible, however severe and oppressive, the inhabitants of these colonies might at least require from the parliament of Great-Britain some evidence, that this dreadful authority over them, has been granted to that body. But a reverence for our Creator, principles of humanity, and the dictates of common sense, must convince all those who reflect upon the subject, that government was instituted to promote the welfare of mankind, and ought to be administered for the attainment of that end. The legislature of Great-Britain, however, stimulated by an inordinate passion for a power not only unjustifiable, but which they know to be peculiarly reprobated by the very constitution of that kingdom, and desperate of success in any mode of contest, where regard should be had to truth, law, or right, have at length, deserting those, attempted to effect their cruel and impolitic purpose of enslaving these colonies by violence, and have thereby rendered it necessary for us to close with their last appeal from reason to arms. - Yet, however blinded that assembly may be, by their intemperate rage for unlimited domination, so to sight justice and the opinion of mankind, we esteem ourselves bound by obligations of respect to the rest of the world, to make known the justice of our cause.\n \n Our forefathers, inhabitants of the island of Great-Britain, left their native land, to seek on these shores a residence for civil and religious freedom. At the expense of their blood, at the hazard of their fortunes, without the least charge to the country from which they removed, by unceasing labor, and an unconquerable spirit, they effected settlements in the distant and unhospitable wilds of America, then filled with numerous and warlike barbarians. -- Societies or governments, vested with perfect legislatures, were formed under charters from the crown, and an harmonious intercourse was established between the colonies and the kingdom from which they derived their origin. The mutual benefits of this union became in a short time so extraordinary, as to excite astonishment. It is universally confessed, that the amazing increase of the wealth, strength, and navigation of the realm, arose from this source; and the minister, who so wisely and successfully directed the measures of Great-Britain in the late war, publicly declared, that these colonies enabled her to triumph over her enemies. --Towards the conclusion of that war, it pleased our sovereign to make a change in his counsels. -- From that fatal movement, the affairs of the British Empire began to fall into confusion, and gradually sliding from the summit of glorious prosperity, to which they had been advanced by the virtues and abilities of one man, are at length distracted by the convulsions, that now shake it to its deepest foundations. -- The new ministry finding the brave foes of Britain, though frequently defeated, yet still contending, took up the unfortunate idea of granting them a hasty peace, and then subduing her faithful friends.\n \n These devoted colonies were judged to be in such a state, as to present victories without bloodshed, and all the easy emoluments of statuteable plunder. -- The uninterrupted tenor of their peaceable and respectful behaviour from the beginning of colonization, their dutiful, zealous, and useful services during the war, though so recently and amply acknowledged in the most honorable manner by his majesty, by the late king, and by parliament, could not save them from the meditated innovations. -- Parliament was influenced to adopt the pernicious project, and assuming a new power over them, have in the course of eleven years, given such decisive specimens of the spirit and consequences attending this power, as to leave no doubt concerning the effects of acquiescence under it. They have undertaken to give and grant our money without our consent, though we have ever exercised an exclusive right to dispose of our own property; statutes have been passed for extending the jurisdiction of courts of admiralty and vice-admiralty beyond their ancient limits; for depriving us of the accustomed and inestimable privilege of trial by jury, in cases affecting both life and property; for suspending the legislature of one of the colonies; for interdicting all commerce to the capital of another; and for altering fundamentally the form of government established by charter, and secured by acts of its own legislature solemnly confirmed by the crown; for exempting the \"murderers\" of colonists from legal trial, and in effect, from punishment; for erecting in a neighboring province, acquired by the joint arms of Great-Britain and America, a despotism dangerous to our very existence; and for quartering soldiers upon the colonists in time of profound peace. It has also been resolved in parliament, that colonists charged with committing certain offences, shall be transported to England to be tried.\n \n But why should we enumerate our injuries in detail? By one statute it is declared, that parliament can \"of right make laws to bind us in all cases whatsoever.\" What is to defend us against so enormous, so unlimited a power? Not a single man of those who assume it, is chosen by us; or is subject to our control or influence; but, on the contrary, they are all of them exempt from the operation of such laws, and an American revenue, if not diverted from the ostensible purposes for which it is raised, would actually lighten their own burdens in proportion, as they increase ours. We saw the misery to which such despotism would reduce us. We for ten years incessantly and ineffectually besieged the throne as supplicants; we reasoned, we remonstrated with parliament, in the most mild and decent language.\n \n Administration sensible that we should regard these oppressive measures as freemen ought to do, sent over fleets and armies to enforce them. The indignation of the Americans was roused, it is true; but it was the indignation of a virtuous, loyal, and affectionate people. A Congress of delegates from the United Colonies was assembled at Philadelphia, on the fifth day of last September. We resolved again to offer an humble and dutiful petition to the King, and also addressed our fellow-subjects of Great-Britain. We have pursued every temperate, every respectful measure; we have even proceeded to break off our commercial intercourse with our fellow-subjects, as the last peaceable admonition, that our attachment to no nation upon earth should supplant our attachment to liberty. -- This, we flattered ourselves, was the ultimate step of the controversy: but subsequent events have shewn, how vain was this hope of finding moderation in our enemies.\n \n Several threatening expressions against the colonies were inserted in his majesty's speech; our petition, tho' we were told it was a decent one, and that his majesty had been pleased to receive it graciously, and to promise laying it before his parliament, was huddled into both houses among a bundle of American papers, and there neglected. The lords and commons in their address, in the month of February, said, that \"a rebellion at that time actually existed within the province of Massachusetts-Bay; and that those concerned with it, had been countenanced and encouraged by unlawful combinations and engagements, entered into by his majesty's subjects in several of the other colonies; and therefore they besought his majesty, that he would take the most effectual measures to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the supreme legislature.\" -- Soon after, the commercial intercourse of whole colonies, with foreign countries, and with each other, was cut off by an act of parliament; by another several of them were entirely prohibited from the fisheries in the seas near their coasts, on which they always depended for their sustenance; and large reinforcements of ships and troops were immediately sent over to general Gage.\n \n Fruitless were all the entreaties, arguments, and eloquence of an illustrious band of the most distinguished peers, and commoners, who nobly and strenuously asserted the justice of our cause, to stay, or even to mitigate the heedless fury with which these accumulated and unexampled outrages were hurried on. -- equally fruitless was the interference of the city of London, of Bristol, and many other respectable towns in our favor. Parliament adopted an insidious maneuver calculated to divide us, to establish a perpetual auction of taxations where colony should bid against colony, all of them uninformed what ransom would redeem their lives; and thus to extort from us, at the point of the bayonet, the unknown sums that should be sufficient to gratify, if possible to gratify, ministerial rapacity, with the miserable indulgence left to us of raising, in our own mode, the prescribed tribute. What terms more rigid and humiliating could have been dictated by remorseless victors to conquered enemies? In our circumstances to accept them, would be to deserve them.\n \n Soon after the intelligence of these proceedings arrived on this continent, general Gage, who in the course of the last year had taken possession of the town of Boston, in the province of Massachusetts-Bay, and still occupied it a garrison, on the 19th day of April, sent out from that place a large detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked assault on the inhabitants of the said province, at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of a great number of persons, some of whom were officers and soldiers of that detachment, murdered eight of the inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord, where they set upon another party of the inhabitants of the same province, killing several and wounding more, until compelled to retreat by the country people suddenly assembled to repel this cruel aggression. Hostilities, thus commenced by the British troops, have been since prosecuted by them without regard to faith or reputation. -- The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrate, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their other effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind.\n \n By this perfidy wives are separated from their husbands, children from their parents, the aged and the sick from their relations and friends, who wish to attend and comfort them; and those who have been used to live in plenty and even elegance, are reduced to deplorable distress.\n \n The general, further emulating his ministerial masters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th day of June, after venting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies, proceeds to \"declare them all, either by name or description, to be rebels and traitors, to supersede the course of the common law, and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise of the law martial.\" -- His troops have butchered our countrymen, have wantonly burnt Charlestown, besides a considerable number of houses in other places; our ships and vessels are seized; the necessary supplies of provisions are intercepted, and he is exerting his utmost power to spread destruction and devastation around him.\n \n We have received certain intelligence, that general Carleton, the governor of Canada, is instigating the people of that province and the Indians to fall upon us; and we have but too much reason to apprehend, that schemes have been formed to excite domestic enemies against us. In brief, a part of these colonies now feel, and all of them are sure of feeling, as far as the vengeance of administration can inflict them, the complicated calamities of fire, sword and famine. We are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission to the tyranny of irritated ministers, or resistance by force. -- The latter is our choice. -- We have counted the cost of this contest, and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery. -- Honor, justice, and humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them, if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon them.\n \n Our cause is just. Our union is perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable. -- We gratefully acknowledge, as signal instances of the Divine favor towards us, that his Providence would not permit us to be called into this severe controversy, until we were grown up to our present strength, had been previously exercised in warlike operation, and possessed of the means of defending ourselves. With hearts fortified with these animating reflections, we most solemnly, before God and the world, declare, that, exerting the utmost energy of those powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness and perseverance, employ for the preservation of our liberties; being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves.\n \n Lest this declaration should disquiet the minds of our friends and fellow-subjects in any part of the empire, we assure them that we mean not to dissolve that union which has so long and so happily subsisted between us, and which we sincerely wish to see restored. -- Necessity has not yet driven us into that desperate measure, or induced us to excite any other nation to war against them. -- We have not raised armies with ambitious designs of separating from Great-Britain, and establishing independent states. We fight not for glory or for conquest. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation or even suspicion of offence. They boast of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than servitude or death.\n \n In our own native land, in defense of the freedom that is our birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it -- for the protection of our property, acquired solely by the honest industry of our fore-fathers and ourselves, against violence actually offered, we have taken up arms. We shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed, and not before.\n \n With an humble confidence in the mercies of the supreme and impartial Judge and Ruler of the Universe, we most devoutly implore his divine goodness to protect us happily through this great conflict, to dispose our adversaries to reconciliation on reasonable terms, and thereby to relieve the empire from the calamities of civil war.\n \n As for the \"American Terrorist Insurrection of 1776\" comment, let me say that one can also still find people in Virginia who refer to the Civil War as the \"War of Northern Aggression.\"",

Yet, for the sake of enjoying my discussion with you I have now done so-again. In my opinion, even reading the words \"well regulated\" in isolation does not alter my view that the militia preamble is a policy statement. \n \n Chester, what are your views on the words \"well-regulated\"?

Suppression of rights and freedoms? I don't know where you're getting this BS, but I assure you that it's nothing but propaganda. Hell, even Chester, as an American citizen, will tell you that we have freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly, and petition. We also have rights against cruel and unusual punishment (if you refer to POWs, the Geneva convention only applies to members of flagged countries, not terrorist organizations. So whatever country you live in could do the same to Hamas or Al Queda members), and excessive bail.\n \n We have rights against quartering troops against our will, unreasonable search and seizure, we are \"innocent 'til proven guilty\", and we have trials by Jury. Unlike most countries, we have the right to keep and bear arms.\n \n I'm sure that Chester, even though we agree on almost nothing, will agree with me on the simple fact that we have these rights. It looks like we have most rights that you do. You're just a propagandist.\n \n So here's the simple question to Chester: regardless of your own opinions, do we have the rights mentioned above? You should know more than subaru, as you are an American citizen.\n \n \nAnd they are being merely accurate. It was a war of Northern aggression.\n -\n\n \n Who needs to read history? It was a British attack you fool, though I expect you to make a pathetic attempt to refute it with another of your lame conspiracy theories.
