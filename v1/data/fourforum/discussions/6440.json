   "Speech given today: \n These are my notes. I recommend that you look at the video of his speech or a transcript for more accurate recall: \n \n POVERTY\n A Close Look At 'The Other America'\n John Edwards\n \n http://www.americanprogressaction.org/site/apps/nl/newsletter2.asp?c=klLWJcP7H&b=917053\n \n Are we going to have a working society? Or a wealth society?\n \n Why are we suspending the Davis-Bacon Act in this time of crisis for working people? Why are we capping the wages of working people while we refuse to cap the salaries of overpaid CEOs?\n \n What about decent jobs that pay decent wages that can support a family? Are we going to go from the Hoovervilles of the 1930s to the Bushvilles of the first part of the 21st century? Is this going to be the legacy of the Republican Party? From Hoovervilles to Bushvilles?\n \n Working people should be able to acquire assets. Lending predators should be stopped from robbing the working class.\n \n Work should guarantee that you can get a good education. Working people should be able to live close to their work, as well as to live in neighborhoods with good schools. Strengthen early childhood programs such as Headstart, including looking at the health and nutritional needs of the kids of lower income families. Also, if working people are able to live closer to their jobs, they will have more time to spend with their families, rather than commuting, and strengthening American families.\n \n Strengthening families. Why are lower-income families hit with a marriage penalty? Earned income credits for working families.\n \n Paying for it. We can pay for tax breaks for the wealthy, we can pay for corporate welfare-what about the essence of America-the working people? Tax policies should not reward wealth instead of work. Tax laws should shield the middle class, not the wealthy who sit around and clip dividends.\n \n The issue of poverty must kept at the forefront of the American consciousness as the top moral issue of our time.",

Not to mention the fact that their rich benefits packages are choking businesses and municipalities to death. Take a look at GM, Delphi, and Ford. Also take a look at New York State. New York State is the highest taxed state in the country. Private sector businesses do not want to come here because the tax burden makes it way too costly to do business here. Also, Medicaid here is the richest in the country and pensions for state workers are not taxed. Look who is against any reform in New York, It's the unions!!

Taxpayer.\n\n \n \n Bassman you are of course a supporter of capitalism and the goal to get as much profit as you can correct.\n \n Now lets say you are a truck driver, \n \n As an individual truck driver your ability to negotiate rates for your hauling services is far more limited then if you form a \"business association\" with other truck drivers to assist in the negotiation process. Walmart has a lot of pricing power on goods it purchases because of the sheer size of Walmart. If it was just one store its abiltiy to negotiate prices would be far lower.\n \n A union serves the same purpose, to ensure that its \"associates\" recieve the best possible price for their services.\n \n If a company negotiates a poor agreement with a union, blame the corporate management, not the union. They are generally not forced to sign new agreements.",

   "But the major flaw with labor unions is that they're not politically neutral and do not represent my views, and also I've seen the results of what unions have done to companies. Bethlehem Steel, Republic Steel, The Courier Express.\n\n \n Bethleham steel and Republic steel neither one went out of business because fo their labor costs, though people seem to want to blam labor costs fro their demise. They both went out ofd busines becuase instead of investing in new machinery and upgrading their production apparatus they gave $60 million/yr in executive perks. Sad, but true. \n \n When their competition reached the point where the steel companies were no longer competitive because they had squandered their money instead of investing in the business, they cried \"cost of labor\" as they sank becuase by that point there was not enough money (or time) left to make the needed improvements. \n \n Sure our labor costs were high. You needed twice as many people working at a bethleham plant as you did working at a steel plant in china for the same output because the Chinese invested in their plants and installed a high level of automation. It was cheaper in the US to keep the labor, so they did, and in the end it came back and bit us in the butt.\n \n Our infrastructure is not crumbling due to labor costs, though they are certainly a factor. It is crumbling from neglect. Even \"modern\" us plants are running on 1970s technonology, ultra modern in the US consists of late 80's to mid 90's technology (one of our more modern plants locally is running allen bradly 500 series PLCs!!). \n \n A large degree of our industrial dominance was for years based primarily on the fact that we were offereing a product that was a generation ahead of the rest of the world. That is no longer the case. With the exception of a few companies heavily subsidized by the government (Honeywell FMT, JPL, Lockheed martin, etc...) most of our industrial offerings are decidedly \"last years model\"",
