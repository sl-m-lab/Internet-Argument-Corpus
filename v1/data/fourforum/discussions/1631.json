   "*Grumble* Here you go. Something I wrote awhile back.\n \n We've heard a lot about Halburton sweet-heart deals and the like, but what the Democrats are telling us isn't exactly true.\n \n As established by Daniel Drezner in Slate, there is no statistically significant correlation between companies that made big campaign contributions and reconstruction contracts.\n \n Steven Kelman, the Director of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy under Bill Clinton, who is in the position to know what he is talking about, says that the allegations of contracts to Bush contributors would be considered absurd or at the least highly improbable to anyone who knows something about the contract process within the government. \n \n THe procurement system is one that is insulated from political pressures. The idea that a Bush administration member could persuade thousands of civil servants to risk their careers to give campaign contributors big contracts is nothing but fantasy.\n \n The contract rewarded to Kellog, Brown & Root, a Haliburton subsidiary, is a routine contract rewarded every few years to provide services to overseas troops. Not everything is covered under this normal contract. Like in the Balkans war, the Defense Department issued a temporary no-bid contract in the Iraq war to put out oil fires. The federal bidding process takes 3-5 months to complete, and KBR already had personnel in the area and the experience to complete the task. In fact, there are only a few companies capable of doing the work, and KBR was the only one that had people in the area.\n \n There was nothing shady about rewarding KBR with the oil fire contract. It had already won the routine service contract in 2001, which, of course, didn't cover oil fires. Stories are similar for many other allegations of cash for campaign contributors.\n \n (Information source: David Brooks, \"Cynics without a case.\" New York Times November 11th, 2003 edition.
