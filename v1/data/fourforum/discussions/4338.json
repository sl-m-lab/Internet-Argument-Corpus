Evo's can back up their theories with cold, hard facts, experiments that have been repeated 100's of times. Evolutionary theories are tested, scientists try their best to rip them to shreds, to falsify them. When these theories can't be falsified, when they continueally make successful predictions, when they are continually verified by new fossil evidence, they are the best explaination available. Creationists have absolutely nothing to back up their claims but 4000 year old myths.\n \n I mean you don't accept anything as proof from Creo's. \n \n Because creationists don't have any real proof! Science never says \"take my word for it!\", it gives you the option of testing the same data, doing the same experiments and proving or disproving a theory for yourself.

That's why you have been asked for evidence. That's why you have been asked to support your assertions.

I suspect that we will find that you will \"challenge\" us \"evos\" with information that you haven't challenged. It will be a statement by some religious guru making religious claims. You will \"believe in\" it - you will accept it without challenge.\n \nNow I know why there are few Creo's on this forum.\n\n There are few \"Creo's\" in this forum because it becomes very quickly apparent to them that they can't defend their belief in mythology. They find out that they have been misinformed and that they are scientifically illiterate. They realize that they have no evidence or proof, only statements of religious faith. That's why they leave. They make statements like, \"radiocarbon dating is inaccurate because it is based on assumptions.\" Creationists are unwilling to examine their beliefs with the same skepticism as they direct at science.\n \n By the way, when asked for evidence you quite rudely responded that you would furnish it when you were good and ready. If you wished to be treated with respect, then wouldn't it have been better to explain that your material wasn't available but you would find it and post it as soon as it was - say next Tuesday? Instead you copped an attitude and responded with snide remarks. You invited the disrespect because you gave none. You are rude and verbally abusive and then play the martyr when you are mocked. We've seen it before. Your behaviour is quite typical of creationists in general, but especially those who can't back up their assertions.\n \n [edit to add] Here's how science works. A scientist makes an observation of some natural event or the effects of some natural event that he/she doesn't understand. Drawing on experience and current theory in that field of science, the scientist formulates a speculative explanation due to natural causes. This is called an hypothesis. If the scientist were to declare, \"It's a miracle!\" then that would shut off all inquiry and place the assertion beyond challenge. That would be giving up. It is important that the hypothesis is open to challenge, that is to say, it must be falsifiable. The scientist then makes a prediction of some potential observation that is a logical requirement of the hypothesis. In other words, the predicted observation must be true if the hypothesis is the correct explanation. This is what I meant when I spoke of predictive value above. The scientist then designs and carries out an experiment that tests whether the observation can be made exactly as predicted. If the scientist is correct, then he publishes his hypothesis in an appropriate scientific journal where his work is evaluated and the testing can be repeated. Sometimes further predictions are made and tested. If the experimentation shows that the hypothesis isn't correct, then it is amended to account for the new experimental data and the process is repeated with further predictions and tests. Sometimes the hypothesis is abandoned entirely.\n \n I certainly hope that your \"proof\" has been subjected to the kind of challenge that scientific theories undergo. Science advances by being challenged. Religion doesn't advance and challenges have resulted in burning at the stake, torture and death.",

I found everything about christianity quite sound. Thank you. \n \n \nBy the way, when asked for evidence you quite rudely responded that you would furnish it when you were good and ready. If you wished to be treated with respect, then wouldn't it have been better to explain that your material wasn't available but you would find it and post it as soon as it was - say next Tuesday? Instead you copped an attitude and responded with snide remarks. You invited the disrespect because you gave none. You are rude and verbally abusive and then play the martyr when you are mocked. We've seen it before. Your behaviour is quite typical of creationists in general, but especially those who can't back up their assertions.\n\n \n Pandion you started mocking me in the last paragraph of your first post, way before I copted an attitude. Had you not mocked me I wouldn't have copted an attitude at all and would have gladly explained my dilemma. You mocked me just after you asked why I couldn't present my edvidence. Then you expect me to be all gleeful and respectful. You are not innocent in this, so don't claim to be. \n \n emoticon_xangel",

Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God: Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.\n \n \n Nope, nothing moral here about the Ten Commandments, and Nothing that influences modern law.\n \n \n 2. Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.\n \n  Still not finding this either moral or part of our secular law\n \n \n 3. The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt \n eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.\n \n  Nope, still not moral or laws\n \n \n 4. All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male. But the firstling of an XXX thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.\n \n  more GOD OWNS YOu morality, but no law or morality.\n \n \n \n \n 5. Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.\n \n  too bad having sunday off isn't a national law But remember, the punishment in the Bible for  working on Sunday IS a law. Guess what it's punishment is? Can you? I will give you a hint.-------- DEAAAAAAAAAATH\n \n But remember, God loves you, but he doesn't like a good work ethic.\n \n 6. And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.\n \n  nope, this aint moral or a law\n \n \n 7. Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel. For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.\n \n \n  I don't remember this one on the law books[/B]\n \n 8. Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.\n \n  I am Glad there are no sacrificial laws \n \n \n 9. The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God.\n 10. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.\n \n \n  Ya know, the Bible is one up on the law here. We don't have a law saying we cannot boil a kid in his mother's milk. Shucks\n \n \n Wow, The ten Commandments are the Pillars of Morality. Aren't they? These are the REAL TEN commandments, not the Ben Hurr ripoff.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \n But laws shouldn't be based on morality, they should be based on keeping the world safe. Once the government steps in passing laws based on morality, they can base anything they do on morality. They've already done it with gay marriage, just wait until they say it's immoral to let people vote.\n Today 10:03 AM\n\n \n I disagree here. Laws ought to be based on moraliy, and they are every day. They are mostly based on a rights/utilitarian ethics system of right and wrong.\n \n Religious morality, however, is not objective, that's why it's wrong to use. There is no objective moral system which says gay marriage is wrong.\n \n Laws are codifications of morality. Everything from speed signs, to welfare, to minimum wages, to criminal codes. Why is it wrong to steal? It's only wrong to steal because it doesn't serve social utility. It creates fear, paranoia, panic, and economic collapose if it happens and is condoned.\n \n Why is it wrong to speed? Because it can realistically hurt someone.",
