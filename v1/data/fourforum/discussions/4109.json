   "When it comes to military aggression, US administration planning for 2005 (Israel basically a financed tool of US administration) points to expansion of the colonization crusade labeled War on Terror. Fellow Americans, grab your wallets as we seek our version of peace in the ME. Part of that planning includes pushing current federal expenses complete with federal compliance to state levels to avoid curtailment of military expansion. \n \n 1.

As I recall, the first such \"landmark\" was to be the occupation of Baghdad. When we actually had baghdad, they were going to stop blowing us up and the flowers would come out, then the cheers would start. Didn't happen. By the time we took baghdad, insurgent attacks were happening on a daily basis (and many folk, including some here, atgued that the infrequency of the attacks denoted acceptance of our policies, rather than being an indicator that the insurgency needed some time to get organised. Fools). \n \n Then, the capture of saddam was going to be the turning point, since we were told by our leaders that the reason we were still meeting such stiff resisatance was that the people didn't believe Saddam was really gone for good. Instead, following the capture of saddam, the insurgency picked up even more momentum, as people realised that Saddam was gone for good, and kicking the US out would not bring him back to power.\n \n The handover of power was also supposed ot be a great turning point. This was a turning point that we carried out in the middle of the night becuase by that point we had lost so much control that we didn't think we could even hold the \"green zone\" in light of all the attacks that were planned by various groups during the ceremony.\n \n Then the elections were going to be the turning point and we are backpedaling on that prediction as rapidly as we can, since now we don't hold enough control over the country to gaurantee the safety of a single election office in each town (most of which have already been heavily fortified). \n \n It is simply pathetic that hte American people are so stupid that they cannot look at the situation and see beyond the next mythical \"turning point\".\n \n \n4. Sharon orders Israeli military to to act immediately with no political or military restrictions to halt repeated rocket fire into southern Israel on Sunday:\n \n http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=7337931\n[/QUOTE]\n \n I think the important thing to note here is that their tactics as far as refusing peace have remained constant. They have stripped the palestenian authority of any real power or authority, and then demand that the Palestenian authority stop the violence among palestenians before any talks of peace will be considered, while at the same time using full military force against the palestenian people, which pretty much ensures that the violence will continue. \n \n This is another of those cases that displays the lighning quick wit of the American people. The israelis have outkilled the palestenians nearly 10,000-1 during the course of this conflict, includinge several massacres where over 10,0000 women and children were killed (one of which was directly supervised by sharon). The israelis are essentially saying \"before we will even talk, you have to forget about all of that\".",

While credit facilities between trading nations (sovereign treasury issues) skirt eventual repayment of capital, that's generally an issue determined by strength of currency and economic future. I see no true US economic expansion in the foreseeable future, as attested to by our abnormal trade deficits, with US international credit facilitated by our trading partners determined to keep us afloat until our valuable markets can be replaced by emerging nations, China in particular. To do otherwise would be disastrous to their economies. Personal US debt will continue to follow national debt for as long as it can be serviced, which is dependent on US employment and the share of median income it distributes to lower and middle income classes. \n \n To depend on Bush's 'Peace Dividend' for future prosperity seems, to me, like the beginning of a really bad acid trip culminating in a ferocious crash. But since I don't use 25% of my personal income to service interest expenses and another 25% investing in depreciating assets similar to vehicles or a military, I'd probably be labeled as unpatriotic by those who elect indulgence in political and personal financial hallucinogens.",
