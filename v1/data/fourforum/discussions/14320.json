   "I&#8217;m really undecided on the issue of guns going into Mexico from the US. I just don&#8217;t think there is enough data to reliably inform us how bad the situation is. I don&#8217;t necessarily accept the Fox article. Ms Longmire does have some accurate criticism of it. However, I did find a lot of bias and error in her piece, and I want to comment upon it&#8230;.\n \n I find it interesting that Ms. Longmire starts with the claim that she has it on &#8220;good authority&#8221; from a &#8220;trusted source&#8221; that the Fox article is incorrect and misleading. It&#8217;s very much a &#8220;trust me, I&#8217;m on the inside and I know&#8221; statement. \n \n She expects me to accept this on faith, for, as she explains, &#8220;I can't tell you the names of my sources or the agencies they work for.&#8221; Nor, apparently, can she disclose any of the information she has obtained from these insider sources. You see, I really expected to find some proof of this insider knowledge. All I found in the rest of the article was information that could be gleaned from publically available internet sources. It is odd to me to see her make the claim that she possesses insider knowledge proving the Fox article is wrong&#8212;and then offer none of that evidence. She might have well said &#8220;I&#8217;ve got this secret knowledge, but if I told you then I would have to kill you.&#8221; \n \n And so, since she is unwilling to offer any information from her special contacts, she starts with an upfront admission: &#8220;That DOES NOT MEAN THEY DID NOT COME FROM THE US...that just means no one can prove it through checking a database.&#8221; (bold emphasis added by me) In other words, there is no evidence to show, and no one can prove, that these untraced weapons came from the US.\n \n However, Ms. Longmire then makes the argument that despite the lack of any proof there is a &#8220;pretty good chance&#8221; that &#8220;somewhere close&#8221; to the desired 90% figure is true. What wonderfully vague language! That&#8217;s like saying if a grenade lands &#8220;somewhere close&#8221; then there is a &#8220;pretty good chance&#8221; you might catch some shrapnel. To base policy decisions on such hopeful analysis is like saying we need not take any more action because BP tell us there is a &#8220;pretty good chance&#8221; it will capture &#8220;somewhere close&#8221; to all the oil leaking in the future from the gulf wellhead. \n \n And how can this assumption that the guns &#8220;probably&#8221; are of US origin have any merit when the very next sentence reads: &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure how anyone can tell just by looking at a gun that it definitely was not originally sold in the US.&#8221;? For this, you see, exposes the assumed bias built into the argument: I want the percentage of guns from the US to be high, so I will assume, unless proven otherwise, that if you can&#8217;t tell by looking at it then there is a &#8220;pretty good chance&#8221; the gun came from the US. I admit there is no proof that the weapon came from the US, but absent any proof that it didn&#8217;t I will assume a &#8220;pretty good chance&#8221; it came from the US. It is a very poor argument in my opinion, and I doubt whether Ms. Longmire understands how she has exposed her bias. Particularly when she later follows up with this curious comment:\n \n &#8220;I'm also not a fan of the implication the authors make that just because a gun doesn't have a serial number (more and more weapons seized in Mexico have the serial numbers filed off), it probably didn't come from the US. Based on the TYPE of weapon seized (such as a semi-automatic handun or revolver or rifle), you CAN REASONABLY ASSUME it was sold - probably legally - in the US and moved south into Mexico.&#8221;\n \n Do you see the doublespeak that exists here?: I&#8217;ve already agreed no evidence exists to link these untraced guns to the US, and no one can prove they did come from the US. But I don&#8217;t like &#8220;implications.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think the Fox article authors should assume that a gun without a serial number didn&#8217;t come from the US&#8212;because I would rather asume that such firearms did come from the US. The clear &#8220;implication&#8221; is that in the absence of facts it&#8217;s OK to assume so long as the assumption helps my theory. \n \n Now let me say what I know about tracing. Guns sold in the US will have a serial number. It is a crime to have any firearm in the US without an identifiable serial number (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922): \n \n It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to transport, ship, or receive, in interstate or foreign commerce, any firearm which has had the importer's or manufacturer's serial number removed, obliterated, or altered or to possess or receive any firearm which has had the importer's or manufacturer's serial number removed, obliterated, or altered and has, at any time, been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\n \n All guns sold in the US must start with a serial number. If a gun is recovered with a serial number, then ATF can contact the manufacturer and discover whether the firearm was delivered to an original point of sale in the US market. If the number has been obliterated, then ATF can, if requested, recover the serial number in the vast majority of cases by a process of acid etching. I&#8217;ve seen it done by our lab in Virginia. It is really a question of how much time and resources you are willing to devote to finding out the origins of guns with an obliterated serial number. Do we really know what resources the two governments are devoting to finding out how many guns came from the US market? But then again, do we even know how many guns recovered in Mexico have had their serial numbers destroyed? Ms. Longmire says the number is &#8220;more and more&#8221;? What does that mean? 10? 100? 1,000? She is supposed to have the inside contacts, and she has no idea how many?\n \n So what about Ms. Longmire&#8217;s complaint that guns can be built out of spare parts in the US and then be shipped to Mexico? It is possible, but I have a hard time accepting that a large number of guns in Mexico come from a US parts assembly process. She cites a website that claims these parts can be legally shipped into the US. If the parts are sold outside the US and are available for import and remanufacture, then why not just bring the parts directly into Mexico for assembly? Why build them here and go through the trouble of smuggling them across the border? The logic escapes me&#8230;.\n \n To be fair, she suggests this may be done because the parts assembler either needs or chooses to use a &#8220;US-made receiver,&#8221; when building a gun out of parts. How many of these assembled parts guns get to Mexico? 50-100-1,000-10,000? Again, her insider sources appear lacking, and she does not even hazard a guess. But whatever the number, she confidently asserts these guns are &#8220;probably&#8221; untraceable:\n \n \"A DTO-obtained assault weapon put together in the US using AK-47 parts and a US-made receiver would probably fall under the \"untraceable\" category - but it still originated in the US.\"\n \n Here is that bias again: You can&#8217;t prove it, and I don&#8217;t have any real idea, but I want to assume these guns &#8220;probably&#8221; originate in the US. Ms. Longmire makes this assumption while &#8220;probably&#8221; being unaware of the definition of &#8220;firearm&#8221; in the US Code (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921):\n \n The term \"firearm\" means\n \n (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive;\n \n (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon;\n \n (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or\n \n (D) any destructive device. Such term does not include an antique firearm. (bold emphasis added by me)\n \n And, therefore, the &#8220;US-made receiver&#8221; would definitely, and not &#8220;probably,&#8221; contain a traceable serial number. Perhaps some of these guns are assembled from parts and the serial number is then obliterated to make them untraceable. How many? Again, Ms. Longmire has absolutely no idea other than &#8220;more and more.&#8221; All she knows for certain is that for her it is a &#8220;disturbing issue.&#8221;\n \n Listen, I don&#8217;t dispute that guns go south. The problem, as I see it, is the Mexican drug gangs have such an appetite for killing that the demand for guns has created a vacuum which sucks in firearms from any possible source. But that is the problem. The desire for violence draws the weapons. The availability of the weapons does not manufacture the violence. If that were so, then the violence would be much higher in the US border states where the guns can be had much more easily without any need to smuggle them across an international border. \n \n The problem with these statistical arguments is they are all guesswork. We simply don&#8217;t know the total number of firearms going south. We don&#8217;t know how many guns have obliterated serial numbers. We don&#8217;t know how many of these ATF has attempted to trace. The Fox analysts don&#8217;t know, and neither does Ms. Longmire (despite her claim of possessing the insider federal agency information). What is clear from reading Ms. Longmire&#8217;s article is this: Her personal bias finds that the absence of evidence is an invitation to engage in baseless speculation. \n \n I don&#8217;t claim to have all the answers, but I am willing to examine the issue. I just do not believe we should base an attempt to deal with these issues upon the flawed speculation Ms. Longmire offers us.",

   "Bryan. To add to your analysis, I offer this passage.\n \n The authors say the standard issue weapon for Mexican army soldiers is the \"Belgian-made M-16,\" which is also untrue. While the Mexican army does use the M-16, the current standard-issue rifle is the FX-05 or the H&K G3. Also, the M-16 is NOT technically Belgian-made, although some aspects are Belgian-designed. The M-16 and its many variants are mostly made by Colt Manufacturing - a US company - and Fabrique Nationale's US subsidiary in South Carolina.\n\n I have never seen ANY AR 15's for sale coming from FN (Fabrique Nationale A Belgian Company) . These are M 16's, Military weapons SOLD TO OTHER GOVERNMENTS! Period! (They are Not the Civilian AR 15) End of BS!\n \n Making the claim that Military Weapons sold to other governments, sales allowed by our government, or those stolen from other armies, or picked up on a battle field, then smuggled into Mexico is a SCAM on the highest order to make it sound like it came from our civilian market! \n \n In other words, those who count these Military Weapons, (Not Civilian Weapons) are trying their very best to STEAL the 2nd Amendment, on any BS claim they can make, in order scam the public and to inflate the numbers.\n \n What do these Military weapons have anything to do with this conversation at all? \n \n And people are using these numbers as a bases to to curtail the sale of Civilian Weapons, or to change our Civilian laws?

   "First of all, your debunking article discovered a math error from 68% to 62%. Wow! First off, we should shoot the author. emoticon_smile\n \n Second, a lot of her analysis is supposition at best. Dose she know how many AK's were supposedly built from parts? Does she know where they got these parts from? Probably not the U.S.. \n \n One thing I can tell you is that, We ABSOLUTELY Know that any receivers made here in the US are marked! Serial numbered. U.S. AK Parts are marked U.S. too! Why? Because it is illegal for one to have an AK in the U.S. built with too many foreign parts so U.S. AK Parts are clearly marked. Made in the U.S.. \n \n The ATF boys want it that way, and they are sticklers on that little point too! It is a Federal Offense to boot. So maybe she should have checked into that before she supposed! No? So we can assume that she apparently doesn't know gun laws either, or she may have supposed differently.\n \n By the way, DO YOU know how many of the things you asked of me? You do however, want to suppose that it is the fault of the U.S. gun owners. \n \n Which means, you want to fly new gun laws on pure supposition, like she did. And Why are we getting blamed for what Criminals do? \n \n And let me use your source. Sylvia Longmire.\n   \"Bush aide urges weapons ban to slow Mexican drug war.\" \n I don't think the issue of the potential reinstatement of an assault weapons ban can be explained too much. It seems to me that many people are under the impression that DTO enforcers only use assault weapons when they kill people, and that is NOT the case. Yes, they do like some types of assault weapons that they legally buy in the US through straw purchasers, but I'm still convinced that reinstating the ban won't make that much of a dent in the southbound weapons flow problem, or in the levels of violence in Mexico. Here's my analysis from April 2009, in response to an article called \"Obama gets gun shy.\":\n \n \"I'm not a firearms expert, so take my analysis knowing that. However, I was able to do some common sense research, and I came to the conclusion that renewing the assault weapons ban would probably not accomplish much by way of stemming the flow of weapons from the US into Mexico.\n &#8230;&#8230;\n Another thing that is VERY important to remember is that DTOs are relying more heavily on military-grade weapons, like grenade launchers, hand grenades, and sniper rifles. These types of weapons not only wouldn't fall within an assault weapons ban, but they're not even purchased by DTO reps in the US. Long story short, a weapons ban would likely be yet another ineffective attempt by the Obama Administration to look like it's doing something - anything - to help the Mexico situation.\n",
