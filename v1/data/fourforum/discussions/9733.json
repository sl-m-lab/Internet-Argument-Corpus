   "**\n The terms \"evolutionist\" and \"darwinist\" are equivocal, in that they mean different things to different people. For me an \"evolutionist\" is a person who believes that life forms, (i.e., organisms), change, in terms of both morphology and behaviour, over the course of generations, as a consequence of perfectly natural causes. And according to that description, I am, myself, an 'evolutionist'. Unfortunately, some people, (principally those who define themselves, or are defined by others as, 'creationists'), define 'evolutionist' as one who believes that organisms evolve over generations thanks to the action of random chance plus some ethereal 'sorting' mechanism called 'selection'. Such people, more properly referred to as 'darwinists', may legitimately be called \"evolutionists\" because they do accept the fact of evolution. However, since at least I myself am not not one of their number, then not all \"evolutionists\" need to subscribe to the 'chance plus happenstance', 'happy accident', 'serendipitous coincidence', inexcusably superstitious and unscientific \"RM+NS\" model as a causational \"explanation\" for evolution. The 'darwinist' model wherebye organisms are passive objects changed over time by the stochastic whimsy of external accidents, i.e., Chance, the goddess of Luck. 'Evolutionist' does equal 'darwinist', and care should be taken to avoid equivocation.\n \n \n All 'evolutionists', be they darwinian or scientific, can be discriminated from non-evolutionists in that non-evolutionists either believe that nothing new or original has happened to life, it's forms and behaviours, since one magic moment when all things were created 'ex nihilo' and instantaneously by an external magician/god, or believe that some novel organisms were created specifically and especially as the mood struck that magician/god over time, or believe that organisms are the passive victims/beneficiaries of changes inflicted/bestowed upon them by that external magician/god as the mood strikes his anthropomorphic will.\n \n In the end, the darwinist goddess, 'Chance', and the creationist, 'magician/god', start to sound like one and the same anthropomorphic, childish, simpleminded superstition, don't you think!?!",
