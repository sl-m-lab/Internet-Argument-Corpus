   "The other deay I made a try to leave Georgia fo France to probe ionto possibility of settling there. I was refused visa first and then I couldn't buy a ticket! What's that? I think that Georgia fell into EU black list or what. Many people are set to leave the country as soon as possible 'cause it seems president is about starting long promised war. So visas are problems. \n Moreover i think that officials are trying to create tickets deficiency artificially. From other side I think that tickets deficiency was created by people who want to leave Georgia becoming more and more uncomfortable place to live in. According to last polls Saakashvili's rating is 12,6% that's why he is trying to forcefully embrace Abkhazia and South Ossetia in hope to change the situation. But I think he has no chance. I'll do everything for leaving Georgia soon. But tickets are really a worry. Have anybody got any relating info?",
