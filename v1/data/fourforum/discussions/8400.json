   "Freedom of religion, of all kinds, is a part of what makes up the rest of our freedoms; it's the main reason we, as US citizens are where we are today. I think some religious sects have abused that freedom and that future religions will follow suit. But that's not your question is it? You want to know why religions of any sort, especially Christians, have more freedoms than say extremist homosexuals. Am I right? That's what I read from your OP. If your question was about freedom of religion instead of religious freedoms it would be easy to answer, Matthew, but your wording is a little tricky.\n \n Religious freedoms do not equal freedom of religion.\n \n If I am wrong in my assumption, I will repost.\n \n As far as choice of which religion a person chooses, or freedom to worship as one pleases, it stands to reason that if that freedom was disallowed for any religion, then the state could declare a certain belief unconstitutional; illegal. Soon there would be but one religion and it would be one through which the government would gain and have sole custody.",
