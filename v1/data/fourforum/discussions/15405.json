You have consistently condemned Atheists for our non belief, preached to people about how \" MORALLY\" better Christians are , and pretty much made yourself seem to be the Best possible Christian there is. Now you say I need to lighten up ..lol.. \n \n Like I said, your posting that video only shows the hypocrisy of religion, and specifically Christianity. I've never met a Christian who thought it was funny to Mock their belief in Jebus. I personally don't care, I just find it hilarious. In fact I find your posting it more hilarious than the Video.. Thanks for the laugh.",
