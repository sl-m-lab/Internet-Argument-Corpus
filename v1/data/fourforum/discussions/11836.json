   "John McCain's path to the presidency narrowed further yesterday with reports that he was giving up on Colorado, a day after a campaign blitz in the battleground state by his running mate, Sarah Palin.\n \n The signs of retrenchment for McCain came on a day when Barack Obama was consumed by family concerns. The Democrat is to take a 36-hour break from the campaign tomorrow to visit his seriously ill grandmother in Hawaii.\n \n The first reports that McCain had given up on Colorado were carried by CNN on Monday. \"Gone,\" one adviser said. Other campaign officials, while denying they had given up on the state, told CNN they were lessening their reliance on a win in Colorado to take the White House.\n \n The campaign was also downgrading its chances in Iowa and New Mexico.\n \n The Republicans were hoping to hang on to all three states, which George Bush narrowly won in 2004.\n \n But with McCain's limited resources against the fundraising juggernaut of the Obama campaign, the Republican has had to make tough decisions on which battlefields to defend.\n \n Obama's lead in Colorado is a more modest 5 points, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average. But he has a huge advantage over the Republican in organisation, with 51 field offices in Colorado, compared with a dozen for McCain.McCain 'gives up' on Colorado as Obama calls time-out to visit sick grandmother | World news | The Guardian\n \n THIS is how \"panicked\" Obama is...\n THIS is how McCain is \"gaining\" on Obama...\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n Face it Repubs. The people have seen the last 8 years of Bush, and they are angry.\n The economics of Bush have come to roost at the worst time.\n \n It's like the Repubs have had a House Party for the last 8 years, and they weren't smart enough to realize that two years ago Mom & Dad made an appearance and started clearing out their friends. While they partied and enjoyed their power, invading Iraq for no good reason and spending like they didn't have to pay the bill racqing up HUGE deficits (when the economy was actually good), they poo-poo-ed anybody who criticized their wanton excess.\n \n And now, it's time for the masses to be heard on election day.\n Buh-bye!\n I really hope you learn something in the next few years.",
