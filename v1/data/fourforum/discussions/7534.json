   "I guess this wasn't wise of Saakashvili not to let Chechens from Ichkeria to cross Georgian border to overwinter by the warm coast of the Black Sea. Very unwise. Now Saakashvili is being attempted on.\n \n I suppose you may have heard that a few days ago an armed portable anti-aircraft missile system IGLA (rus. \"needle\") was recovered near the South Ossetian conflict zone and is alleged to be meant to down Saakashvili's aircraft. It was like Saakashvili was expecting for it or at least knew there would be \"an attempt\" 'cause he stated right away that it is South Ossetia that was seeking his life. But I think he should not go too far and should rather be seeking attempters round about him. I mean Chechens. The problem of Saakashvili is that he does not know what kind of people are in his immediate surrounding. His personal guards are all Chechens and they never break up blood relationships so, once Saakashvili offended Chechens in Ichkeria (Pankisi Gorge), they will be revenged by relatives from amongst Saakashvili's guard. As for Saakashvili himself, he is too blind to notice the evidence of Chechen threat or deliberately ignores it for he put stakes on Chechen rebels seeking their help in his war against South Ossetia and Abkhazia. He has been arming them since last autumn.",
