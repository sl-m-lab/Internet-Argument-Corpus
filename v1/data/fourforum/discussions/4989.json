   "So does someone want to take up the challenge? I would also like to clarify on whether it is \"invade\" or \"occupy\" or else both. Someone else has already said they will take up the debate, but there has been no activity since. If there is already a debate planned I appologize, but I would like to participate in a formal debate and this seems to me one that I could handle without being totally humiliated :). I will point out that I have never participated in any formal debate but would like to start. If someone else is already going to debate the original poster on this then I'll just crawl off to some other debate to start on, but if there has been no challenge, I would be willing to take the original poster up on the challenge.",
