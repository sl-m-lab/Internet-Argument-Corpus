   "The following is from an article, \"What Drives Evolution\" from LliveScience, and quoting Pigluicci. Perhaps someone who has been here long enough to acquire such privilege can post the link for me. Wascally Wabbit?\n \n \n \"I think one of the greatest mysteries in biology at the moment is whether natural selection is the only process capable of generating organismal complexity,\" said Massimo Pigliucci of the Department of Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University in New York, \"or whether there are other properties of matter that also come into play. I suspect the latter will turn out to be true.\" \n\n \n Bertvan: I suspect that once those \"other processes\" are acknowledged, most people will realize it is unlikely that \"natural selection\" ever actually created anything. \n \n \nOne idea is that organisms are equipped with the flexibility to change their physical or other features during development to accommodate environmental changes, a phenomenon called phenotypic plasticity. \n \n The change typically doesn't show up in the genes. For instance, in social bees, both the workers and guards have the same genomes but different genes get activated to give them distinct behaviors and appearances. Environmental factors, such as temperature and embryonic diet, prompt genetic activity that ends up casting one bee a worker and the other a guard. \n \n If beneficial, this flexibility could be passed on to offspring and so can lead to the evolution of new features in a species. \"This plasticity is heritable, and natural selection can favor different kinds of plasticity, depending on the range of environmental conditions the organism encounters,\" Pigliucci said. \n\n \n Bertvan: Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis proposes that living individual organisms, not their genomes, respond to internal and environmental challenges, intelligently and purposefully, that such adaptations are inherited epigenetically, as they develop, and the phenotype only instigates a reorganization of its genome to reflect such adaptations if they persistent over many generations.\n \n \nSelf-organization is another evolutionary force that some experts say whips up complex features or behaviors spontaneously in living and non-living matter, and these traits are passed on to offspring through the generations. \n \n \n Bertvan: Does this self-organization force \"whip up\" complex features intelligently and purposefully? Or does it \"whip them up\" by some unknown deterministic process in which creativity is somehow achieved by accident?\n \n \n \"A classic example outside of biology are hurricanes: These are not random air movements at all, but highly organized atmospheric structures that arise spontaneously given the appropriate environmental conditions,\" Pigliucci said. \"There is increasing evidence that living organisms generate some of their complexity during development in an analogous manner.\" \n\n \n Bertvan: Perhaps Dr. Pigluicci doesn't see a difference between the organization of a hurricane and the organization of a living system. Most people do see a difference. The deterministic mechanisms that affect a hurricane are well understood and predictable. On the other hand no one can even speculate how such things as \"temperature and embryonic diet\" might cause proteins to fold differently and thus \"whip up\" complex systems such as \"eyes, bacterial flagella, wings and turtle shells\" .",

And a reasonable person could easily contend that mutation and natural selection taken together ARE in fact part and parcel of \"self-organization\" could they not.
