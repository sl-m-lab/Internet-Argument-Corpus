   "DeRoche is holding up movement on House Bill 5616, which seeks to protect students from bullying. According to Michigan Equality, there is enough support in the Michigan House to pass the bill. \n \n The bill has received very public support from Gov. Jennifer Granholm (she plugged it in her State of the State address), which may have soured legislative Republicans to the idea. After all, the GOP-dominated House and Senate are loath to support anything Granholm supports.\n \n However, according to Triangle Foundation, \"Speaker DeRoche is blocking the bill from seeing the light of day, we fear, because it would also grant greater protections to GLBT youth and other minorities.\" Never mind that LGBT youth are at a greater risk of being bullied.\n \n Now why on earth would DeRoche do that? Well, the Republicans are currently playing hot and heavy to their social conservative base. It's not that these folks believe LGBT youth don't deserve to be protected - these folks believe that LGBT youth don't exist. To pass the bullying bill would be to acknowledge that there is such a thing as a gay kid, just as passing a bill protecting, say - elves, acknowledges the existence of elves. The only difference is that most rational people do not believe in elves, but they do believe in gay kids. \n \n Which means the people currently running Michigan's government might as well believe in elves. Perhaps they also believe that it's better to let gay kids get beat up in the locker room in the hopes that it'll knock the gay out of them.\n \n http://www.pridesource.com/article.shtml?article=19314\n \n http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060321/NEWS04/603210350/1001/news",

This is a good law to pass. In fact, it may not be a bad idea to include provisions that make school adminstrators or teachers liable if they witness bullying or are aware of bullying and fail to act. \n \n I fail to see this as an overextension of government power. IF anything, this is cutting those kids a break. Most bullying type activies would be crimes if they were adults, and they could have simply made the law so that cases were immediatly turned over to the police for review and prosecution where possible. \n \n I apologize for previously calling the law stupid.
