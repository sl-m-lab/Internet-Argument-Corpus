   "The silly attempts to banish even the very mention of religious things from public events continue ...\n \n \" WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A number of atheists and non-religious organizations want Barack Obama's inauguration ceremony to leave out all references to God and religion.\n President-elect Barack Obama will use the Bible Abraham Lincoln used for his inauguration.\n \n President-elect Barack Obama will use the Bible Abraham Lincoln used for his inauguration.\n \n In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Washington, the plaintiffs demand that the words \"so help me God\" not be added to the end of the president's oath of office.\n \n In addition, the lawsuit objects to plans for ministers to deliver an invocation and a benediction in which they may discuss God and religion.\n \n An advance copy of the lawsuit was posted online by Michael Newdow, a California doctor and lawyer who has filed similar and unsuccessful suits over inauguration ceremonies in 2001 and 2005.\n \n Joining Newdow in the suit are groups advocating religious freedom or atheism, including the American Humanist Association, the Freedom from Religion Foundation and atheist groups from Minnesota; Seattle, Washington; and Florida.\n \n The new lawsuit says in part, \"There can be no purpose for placing 'so help me God' in an oath or sponsoring prayers to God, other than promoting the particular point of view that God exists.\"\n \n Newdow said references to God during inauguration ceremonies violate the Constitution's ban on the establishment of religion.\n \n Newdow and other plaintiffs say they want to watch the inaugural either in person or on television. As atheists, they contend, having to watch a ceremony with religious components will make them feel excluded and stigmatized.\n \n \"Plaintiffs are placed in the untenable position of having to choose between not watching the presidential inauguration or being forced to countenance endorsements of purely religious notions that they expressly deny,\" according to the lawsuit.\n \n Among those named in the lawsuit are Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts, who is expected to swear in the new president; the Presidential Inauguration Committee; the Joint Congressional Committee on Inauguration Ceremonies and its chairwoman, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California; and the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee and its commander, Maj. Gen. Richard Rowe Jr.\n \n The two ministers scheduled to participate in the ceremony also are named: the Rev. Rick Warren and the Rev. Joseph Lowery. The document includes a quotation from Warren on atheists: \"I could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says, 'I don't need God.' \"\n \n Newdow told CNN that he didn't name President-elect Barack Obama in the suit because in addition to participating as a government official at the ceremony, he possesses rights as an individual that allow him to express religious beliefs.\n \n \"If he chooses to ask for God's help, I'm not going to challenge him,\" Newdow said. \"I think it's unwise.\"\n \n Newdow said that as a member of a racial minority, Obama should have respect for atheists, who also are members of a minority.\n \n Newdow said religious references in the inauguration ceremony send a message to non-believers.\n \n \"The message here is, we who believe in God are the righteous, the real Americans,\" he said.\n \n Newdow said it's unconstitutional to imply that atheists and others are not as good.\n \n He acknowledged that his suit is unlikely to be successful.\n \n \"I have no doubt I'll lose,\" he said, adding that he hoped to eventually succeed through appeals and hoped future inauguration ceremonies would exclude religious references.\"\n \n Lawsuit seeks to take 'so help me God' out of inaugural - CNN.com\n \n Essentially, this is an attempt of someone to use censorship during the inauguration. I find it alarming there's an increasingly significantly vocal contingent of atheists who are intolerant of even the very mention of religious elements from public discourse and events. This sort of thing is an example of a lack of intolerance, and isn't a good thing. Such intolerance is counter to what I believe are American values, which involve living alongside people we disagree with, even if they state different views. There's no right to not be offended, and no basis for taking away another's free speech because of being offended. (It's not like this falls under the \"yelling-fire-in-a-crowd\" category.) And how exactly is the mere presence of religious comments a form of indicating atheists are not as good as everyone else? Theism is a prevalent view. It's not going away, nor should it have to.\n \n I also think all these people who are freaking out over the religious elements in the inauguration (e.g. the Rick Warren howls) need to calm down, and reserve judgment until after they see the inauguration. Obama has said that many points-of-view will be represented at the event.",

Censorship involves the government stifling the views of an individual or group of individuals. This is an attempt to prevent the government itself from doing something.\n \n \n ... Such intolerance is counter to what I believe are American values, which involve living alongside people we disagree with, even if they state different views.\n\n \n But an atheist could live alongside theists quite happily without wanting a member of the government acting in his official capacity to express a theistic viewpoint. Just as as theist could live alongside atheists quite happily without wanting a member of the government acting in his official capacity to express an atheistic viewpoint.\n \n And atheists are on the receiving end of far more intolerance than theists are. It's not even close.\n \n \nThere's no right to not be offended, and no basis for taking away another's free speech because of being offended.\n\n \n True, but the legal basis for the suit has nothing to do with being offended. It's about whether or not it's appropriate for the government to endorse, even if only minimally, a religious position.\n \n \nAnd how exactly is the mere presence of religious comments a form of indicating atheists are not as good as everyone else? Theism is a prevalent view. It's not going away, nor should it have to.\n\n \n But why should prevalence result in inclusion in the official ceremonies of government?\n \n Guarantees of religious freedom are anti-majoritarian in nature. They protect precisely those individuals who hold views that are not prevalent. They already lose the popularity game. Why should the government, which is obligated to defend them no less than any other citizen, build their more successful competitors' views into official ceremonies?\n \n \nI also think all these people who are freaking out over the religious elements in the inauguration (e.g. the Rick Warren howls) need to calm down, and reserve judgment until after they see the inauguration. Obama has said that many points-of-view will be represented at the event.\n\n \n And that \"many points-of-view\" is a good thing. But I guarantee there will not be an atheist on that stage speaking as an atheist. Can you imagine the firestorm that would ensue? Every religiously conservative pundit out there would \"freak out.\"\n \n I am a Christian. I think the many minor references to God in the ostensibly secular institutions of our government add up to quite a lot. And their net effect is not good. \"So help me God\" at inaugurations; \"In God we trust\" on currency; \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance (added in during the Cold War); \"God bless America\" at the end of virtually every political speech anymore -- these phrases blur the line between government and church, between political leadership and religious leadership. I would personally like to see every last one of them removed. Let government be government and church be church.\n \n I know that's not going to happen, of course.

   "How can one hate that which does not exist?\n\n \n If they truly believed that God doesn't exist, then they wouldn't hate the idea of Him, and they wouldn't so strongly resent that others acknowledge this non existent God. It would mean nothing more to them than children acknowledging fairy tales. But with these militant atheists it's much more than that. They take it upon themselves to attempt to restrict the concept of God for everyone even though He isn't being forced on them personally at all.\n \n So their claim that they don't believe He exists belies the fact that they attack the concept of him not as a personal entity, but as a universal entity. That becomes more than a personal belief. It becomes a religion unto itself which stands against Him and anyone who does believe in Him. Atheism is as much of a religious belief as christianity is, it's just that atheists worship Man as the ultimate being, not a separate and supreme being.\n \n Even the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals agrees with me in that it ruled Atheism to be a religion.\n LAW OF THE LAND\n Court rules atheism a religion\n Decides 1st Amendment protects prison inmate's right to start study group\n Posted: August 20, 2005\n 1:00 am Eastern\n \n WorldNetDaily.com\n \n A federal court of appeals ruled yesterday Wisconsin prison officials violated an inmate's rights because they did not treat atheism as a religion.\n \n \"Atheism is [the inmate's] religion, and the group that he wanted to start was religious in nature even though it expressly rejects a belief in a supreme being,\" the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals said.\n \n The court decided the inmate's First Amendment rights were violated because the prison refused to allow him to create a study group for atheists.\n \n Brian Fahling, senior trial attorney for the American Family Association Center for Law & Policy, called the court's ruling \"a sort of Alice in Wonderland jurisprudence.\"\n \n \"Up is down, and atheism, the antithesis of religion, is religion,\" said Fahling.\n \n The Supreme Court has said a religion need not be based on a belief in the existence of a supreme being.

The persons are understood to exist as God the Father, God the Son (incarnate as Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit, each of them having the one identical essence or nature, not merely similar natures.\n\n \n \nTrinitarianism, belief in the Trinity, is a mark of Oriental and Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism and all the mainstream traditions arising from the Protestant Reformation, such as Anglicanism, Lutheranism and Presbyterianism.

You're approach is to start with restriction rather than freedom. It doesn't work that way.\n\n \n No, my approach is to recognize that it is not the government's job to talk about God.\n \n This is not a restriction of the freedom of government officials. They are free to hold any religious beliefs they want to, and even to talk about them in public, in interviews about their personal lives, for example. But that doesn't mean that their religious beliefs should be enshrined in official acts or ceremonies.\n \n \nThe government isn't actively doing anything. The active thing would be to restrict people uttering anything religious.\n\n \n I'm not talking about restricting people from uttering anything religious. I'm talking about making sure that the government doesn't utter anything religious.\n \n There are restrictions that come along with any job. An individual who works for, say, the Coca-Cola corporation can't talk with Pepsi about how Coke does business. This is not a denial of that individual's freedom. It's a matter of the responsibilities he's taken in virtue of his role as a Coke employee.\n \n Similarly, the president has taken on certain responsibilities in virtue of his role as head of the executive branch. Indeed, we address the president as \"Mr. President\" precisely to emphasize his role rather than his individuality. He is free to believe what he will about religious matters, but that role constrains him to act in ways that make his religious beliefs irrelevant.\n \n \n The goverment is just letting people be people, in this case.\n\n \n But the president is not just a person. He's the head of the executive branch of government, and when he speaks in that capacity, he's got a set of responsbilities other than just being himself.\n \n \nIt's like asking a baseball player to take part in something but tell him 'you can't say a word about baseball'.\n\n \n Bad analogy. It's actually like asking a baseball player not to do anything but play baseball when he's on the field.\n \n \nPeople have to be free to be human...\n\n \n And they are.\n \n \n...and theism is a basic part of most peoples' lives in this country.\n\n \n True. But why should that mean that theism gets enshrined into official ceremonies? Other religious views are basic parts of some people's lives, too. And they are no less Americans than you or me.\n \n \nIf it's a good thing then why do you have a problem with religious elements being present at an inauguration?\n\n \n It's a good thing to include people of diverse religious backgrounds. It's not a good thing to picking out one of those religious backgrounds and giving it a more prominent role in a governmental event.\n \n \nJust as America hasn't collapsed by the term 'so help me God' at the inauguration. We have to have freedom as the default standard rather restriction as the standard.\n\n \n Restriction isn't my default. My default is, keep religion out of politics. Entirely.\n \n Not keep it out of the public square. Not keep it out of politicians' lives or decision-making. Both of these would be restrictions of individuals' freedom.\n \n But keep religion out of the official acts of government, whether legislation or ceremony or whatever.",

So for those of us committed to the Biblical teaching that Jesus is God and Yahweh in the flesh, we find a major discrepancy between the three religions. It is well known that Judaism and Islam teach that God does not have a Son and so they reject the Biblical teaching (Isaiah 9:6; Psalm 2:7; Prov 30:4; John 1:1-3; Hebrews 1:1-3). Based on the descriptions of how God describes Himself in the Bible, we conclude that we certainly don&#8217;t worship the same &#8220;God.&#8221; The beauty of Christianity is not that &#8220;man became God&#8221;, but instead that God became a human and lived among us (John 1:14). God came down in the person of Jesus to live like us, eat like us, hurt like us, and sorrow like us. Jesus understands the way human life is because He lived as a human. The next time you have pain or joy in your life, God understands because He too has lived with pain. That is why Jesus is so compassionate towards us, He understands! It&#8217;s also the reason why the true God as revealed in the person of Jesus will accept no other worship.

   "Although the quote holly posted is right on the money, the discussion has gone way off topic. Islam isn't the issue here even though it's undoubtedly proven itself to be an anti-christian and anti Jewish cult which even has its own book/gospel. The obvious evidence of that is they consider both belief systems to be made up of infidels whom they are dedicated to wiping off of the face of the Earth. How could such an inconsistency and contradiction exist if they in fact worshiped the same God as the two belief systems they hate so much?\n \n But back on topic, here's a poll which gets right to the heart of the matter since the latest protest has been whether Rick Warren should be allowed to mention the name of Jesus, or not.\n \n Would you advise Rev. Rick Warren to avoid mentioning the name of Jesus during his inaugural invocation?\n \n Yes - 5.30%\n \n No - 94.30%\n \n Unsure - 0.40%\n \n 25884 responses\n OneNewsNow.com - Poll\n \n And almost 26,000 poll respondents isn't an insignificant number from which to derive a valid result. It shows that the vast majority of Americans ARE NOT offended by the mention of His name in any way. It also shows very clearly what percentage of Americans are militant atheists. \n \n I also think that the most important question here is, what right does a small minority of people have to control the content of an invocation when not even one of them is being forced to attend, watch or listen to that event? \n \n The very idea that the content of the invocation should be changed to satisfy the sensibilities of a small group of God haters when the vast majority of Americans are fine with it is just ludicrous. \n \n \nThe silly attempts to banish even the very mention of religious things from public events continue ...\n \n \" WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A number of atheists and non-religious organizations want Barack Obama's inauguration ceremony to leave out all references to God and religion.\n President-elect Barack Obama will use the Bible Abraham Lincoln used for his inauguration.\n \n President-elect Barack Obama will use the Bible Abraham Lincoln used for his inauguration.\n \n In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Washington, the plaintiffs demand that the words \"so help me God\" not be added to the end of the president's oath of office.\n \n In addition, the lawsuit objects to plans for ministers to deliver an invocation and a benediction in which they may discuss God and religion.\n \n An advance copy of the lawsuit was posted online by Michael Newdow, a California doctor and lawyer who has filed similar and unsuccessful suits over inauguration ceremonies in 2001 and 2005.\n \n Joining Newdow in the suit are groups advocating religious freedom or atheism, including the American Humanist Association, the Freedom from Religion Foundation and atheist groups from Minnesota; Seattle, Washington; and Florida.\n \n The new lawsuit says in part, \"There can be no purpose for placing 'so help me God' in an oath or sponsoring prayers to God, other than promoting the particular point of view that God exists.\"\n \n Newdow said references to God during inauguration ceremonies violate the Constitution's ban on the establishment of religion.\n \n Newdow and other plaintiffs say they want to watch the inaugural either in person or on television. As atheists, they contend, having to watch a ceremony with religious components will make them feel excluded and stigmatized.\n \n \"Plaintiffs are placed in the untenable position of having to choose between not watching the presidential inauguration or being forced to countenance endorsements of purely religious notions that they expressly deny,\" according to the lawsuit.\n \n Among those named in the lawsuit are Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts, who is expected to swear in the new president; the Presidential Inauguration Committee; the Joint Congressional Committee on Inauguration Ceremonies and its chairwoman, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California; and the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee and its commander, Maj. Gen. Richard Rowe Jr.\n \n The two ministers scheduled to participate in the ceremony also are named: the Rev. Rick Warren and the Rev. Joseph Lowery. The document includes a quotation from Warren on atheists: \"I could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says, 'I don't need God.' \"\n \n Newdow told CNN that he didn't name President-elect Barack Obama in the suit because in addition to participating as a government official at the ceremony, he possesses rights as an individual that allow him to express religious beliefs.\n \n \"If he chooses to ask for God's help, I'm not going to challenge him,\" Newdow said. \"I think it's unwise.\"\n \n Newdow said that as a member of a racial minority, Obama should have respect for atheists, who also are members of a minority.\n \n Newdow said religious references in the inauguration ceremony send a message to non-believers.\n \n \"The message here is, we who believe in God are the righteous, the real Americans,\" he said.\n \n Newdow said it's unconstitutional to imply that atheists and others are not as good.\n \n He acknowledged that his suit is unlikely to be successful.\n \n \"I have no doubt I'll lose,\" he said, adding that he hoped to eventually succeed through appeals and hoped future inauguration ceremonies would exclude religious references.\"\n \n Lawsuit seeks to take 'so help me God' out of inaugural - CNN.com\n \n Essentially, this is an attempt of someone to use censorship during the inauguration. I find it alarming there's an increasingly significantly vocal contingent of atheists who are intolerant of even the very mention of religious elements from public discourse and events. This sort of thing is an example of a lack of intolerance, and isn't a good thing. Such intolerance is counter to what I believe are American values, which involve living alongside people we disagree with, even if they state different views. There's no right to not be offended, and no basis for taking away another's free speech because of being offended. (It's not like this falls under the \"yelling-fire-in-a-crowd\" category.) And how exactly is the mere presence of religious comments a form of indicating atheists are not as good as everyone else? Theism is a prevalent view. It's not going away, nor should it have to.\n \n I also think all these people who are freaking out over the religious elements in the inauguration (e.g. the Rick Warren howls) need to calm down, and reserve judgment until after they see the inauguration. Obama has said that many points-of-view will be represented at the event.\n",

So for those of us committed to the Biblical teaching that Jesus is God and Yahweh in the flesh, we find a major discrepancy between the three religions. It is well known that Judaism and Islam teach that God does not have a Son and so they reject the Biblical teaching (Isaiah 9:6; Psalm 2:7; Prov 30:4; John 1:1-3; Hebrews 1:1-3). Based on the descriptions of how God describes Himself in the Bible, we conclude that we certainly don't worship the same \"God.\" The beauty of Christianity is not that \"man became God\", but instead that God became a human and lived among us (John 1:14). God came down in the person of Jesus to live like us, eat like us, hurt like us, and sorrow like us. Jesus understands the way human life is because He lived as a human. The next time you have pain or joy in your life, God understands because He too has lived with pain. That is why Jesus is so compassionate towards us, He understands! It's also the reason why the true God as revealed in the person of Jesus will accept no other worship. He is not Allah or any other name. \n \n Author; Mondo Gonzales, Pastor of CrossRoads Community Church in New Lenox \n \n \"Do all Religions Worship the Same God#\"\n \n Of course you are entitled to yours. Does this mine either one of us is correct? there will never be any way of knowing, hence the \"respectfully\" disagree.\n\n \n \n Well, I agree with him, but for different reasons. The passages in the Jewish Scriptures that are mentioned do not refer to Jesus at all, and often aren't even messanic. \n \n For example, Isaiah 9:6 specifically refers to Hezekiah, not Jesus. As for Psalm 2:7, if you read it in CONTEXT, it is talking about how King David became the 'son of god' (I.e. exulted) when he became King of Israel (which is one of the anointed ones). It is an euphemism, not literal.\n \n Of course, the Jewish faith do not accept John and Hebrews as 'biblical'. \n \n So, yes, the Christians do not worship the same god as the Jews. They worship a man.",

Isaiah 52:14-53:12\n Isa 52:14 Just as many were astonished at you, {My people,} So His appearance was marred more than any man And His form more than the sons of men.\n \n Isa 52:15 Thus He will sprinkle many nations, Kings will shut their mouths on account of Him; For what had not been told them they will see, And what they had not heard they will understand. \n \n Isa 53:1 Who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?\n \n Isa 53:2 For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, And like a root out of parched ground; He has no {stately} form or majesty That we should look upon Him, Nor appearance that we should be attracted to Him.\n \n Isa 53:3 He was despised and forsaken of men, A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; And like one from whom men hide their face He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.\n \n Isa 53:4 Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted.\n \n Isa 53:5 But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being {fell} upon Him, And by His scourging we are healed.\n \n Isa 53:6 All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on Him.\n \n Isa 53:7 He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a lamb that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers, So He did not open His mouth.\n \n Isa 53:8 By oppression and judgment He was taken away; And as for His generation, who considered That He was cut off out of the land of the living For the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke {was due?}\n \n Isa 53:9 His grave was assigned with wicked men, Yet He was with a rich man in His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.\n \n Isa 53:10 But the LORD was pleased To crush Him, putting {Him} to grief; If He would render Himself {as} a guilt offering, He will see {His} offspring, He will prolong {His} days, And the good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand.\n \n Isa 53:11 As a result of the anguish of His soul, He will see {it and} be satisfied; By His knowledge the Righteous One, My Servant, will justify the many, As He will bear their iniquities.\n \n Isa 53:12 Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great, And He will divide the booty with the strong; Because He poured out Himself to death, And was numbered with the transgressors; Yet He Himself bore the sin of many, And interceded for the transgressors.\n By all accounts this book was written around 700 BC. a full 7 centuries before Jesus of Nazareth was born.

   "It amounts to endorsing the religious idea in question.\n\n \n So if I say \"yesterday when I drove to work ...\" in the course of a conversation, you actually think that's an act of endorsing automobiles? Come on. No. We're talking about religion in public comments due to religion's ubiquitous nature, not someone standing up saying \"you should be religious\" or \"so-and-so religion is the correct one\". Webster's Dictionary defines \"endorse\" as\n \"to approve openly <endorse an idea< ; especially : to express support or approval of publicly and definitely\" \n \n and to \"recommend\".\n It does not include the idea of mentioning something. When someone holds up a bottle of Windex and says \"this product is what you should use\" or \"I recommend Windex\", THAT'S endorsing. When someone says \"so help me god\" after taking their oath, that's not endorsing.\n \n \nNo, my approach is to recognize that it is not the government's job to talk about God.\n \n But the president is not just a person. He's the head of the executive branch of government, and when he speaks in that capacity, he's got a set of responsbilities other than just being himself.\n\n \n It's not technically the government's job or the president's job to talk about the White House dog. But it's been known to come up publicly in a press conference. It's technically not really the government's job to mention one's wife or family, but a president often acknowledges his wife at a State of the Union speech. If officials are to be restricted to never speak of things that it's technically not the government's job to talk about, then that's pretty darn unreasonable and overly-restrictive. Government consists of people--it's not some mechanical machine. We have to let them be human, and we mustn't try to sterilize public discourse with some Anything-But-Theism approach. Theism and religion are a huge part of life, and you might as well be demanding people not talk about their family or anything else ubiquitous.\n \n \nI'm not talking about restricting people from uttering anything religious. I'm talking about making sure that the government doesn't utter anything religious.\n\n \n Government consists of people, Matthew. When you say you don't want government to utter anything religious, that means people. It's an unreasonable approach.\n \n \nThere are restrictions that come along with any job. An individual who works for, say, the Coca-Cola corporation can't talk with Pepsi about how Coke does business. This is not a denial of that individual's freedom. It's a matter of the responsibilities he's taken in virtue of his role as a Coke employee.\n\n \n But that's a case of a conflict of interests. There is no conflict of interests with most cases of something pertaining to religion being uttered in public by a government official. I'm not saying there can never be such a case, but really it would be rare for it to be that way; it would have to be pretty unusual circumstances. An example might be if someone's religion involved refusal of serving in government. I remember a few years ago that it was asked of Joe Lieberman if he would conduct government business on a Sabbath if it was needed. He said he would, if I recall. If an official said not and cited his religion as the reason, that would constitute a conflict of interests between religion and government service.\n \n \nOther religious views are basic parts of some people's lives, too. And they are no less Americans than you or me. It's a good thing to include people of diverse religious backgrounds. It's not a good thing to picking out one of those religious backgrounds and giving it a more prominent role in a governmental event.\n \n\n \n This is a different issue--you're now talking about a possible need to balance religious-speak, which is not really the same as what you've been arguing: essentially to eliminate all religious-speak whatsoever and therefore impose upon officials to keep something that is a major part of life experience in the closet. The need for balance or at least acknowledgment may (or may not) be valid one, but it's a different scope of topic, with different implications than what you've been arguing so far.\n \n \nBut keep religion out of the official acts of government, whether legislation or ceremony or whatever.\n\n \n There's a huge difference between legislation and ceremony, to where the two shouldn't really even be in the same sentence in this case. There are any number of things that have to be kept out of legislation. No one here is talking about legislation, and it's not even part of this discussion. The article had nothing whatsoever to do with policy-making. The problem here is that some are now going farther than that to keeping the mentioning of their faith banished from public statements altogether. And that is being unreasonable, IMO.",

But even supposing that all Muslims felt that way -- and I hate to burst your bubble, but not all of them do -- why couldn't that simply indicate a mistaken interpretation of that same God's will?\n\n \n Here's a question for you Matt. How sanctimonious must one be to tell someone who was born into islam that their view of it is ignorant? And of what importance is it what most moslems personally believe, when we are discussing what the religion teaches and stands for? I say this because I know personally that nobody in my family thinks like radical moslems do. But islam still teaches these atrocities which so clearly conflict with Judaism and Christianity. So try to stay on point if that's at all possible, for once.\n Qur&#8217;an honors and promote deceit to advance Islam against the Infidels. \n \n Taqiyyamasters will tell you the Qur&#8217;an is being mistranslated to English. This is BS. The verses in all the translations are remarkably similar. A manifest of intimidation, war and murder. It&#8217;s easy to see, but hard for many to believe because its vileness and deceit are repulsive. Now you will understand just a bit more about how jihad is fundamental to Islam.\n 6) Muslims all the time claim you are reading an English Qur&#8217;an that has misinterpreted the original Arabic. This is complete BS. The Qur&#8217;an is not that complicated at all. The chapters are out of order, which is stupid and confuses the reader who does not know this, but now you know the correct sequence. You can look at many English translations, and they are extremely close. Really, how does &#8216;kill&#8217; in Arabic get mistranslated into &#8216;love&#8217; rather than &#8216;kill.&#8217; It can&#8217;t be.\n \n Here is just a sample of Mohammad&#8217;s revelations:\n \n Everything Those Infidels Have Everywhere In the World Already Belongs to the Muslims, Take It\n \n Qur&#8217;an 33.27 And He made you heirs to their land and their dwellings and their property, and (to) a land which you have not yet trodden, and Allah has power over all things.\n \n Qur&#8217;an 21:44 Do they see Us advancing, gradually reducing the land (in their control), curtailing its borders on all sides? It is they who will be overcome. NOTE: Political Correctness and Multiculturalism has proven to be the most powerful weapon for the advancement of Dar al-Islam since 1945.\n \n About Those Annoying Non-Believers (Infidels, Pagans, Jews, Christians, etc.)\n \n Qur&#8217;an 9:123 &#8220;murder them and treat them harshly&#8221; \n Qur&#8217;an 3.28 Let not the believers take the unbelievers for friends rather than believers; and whoever does this, he shall have nothing of (the guardianship of) Allah, but you should guard yourselves against them, guarding carefully; and Allah makes you cautious of (retribution from) Himself; and to Allah is the eventual coming.\n NOTE: By &#8216;guarding carefully&#8217;, a Muslim should deceive the infidel. Acting as a friend is fine as long as it is to benefit the Muslim and protect Islam.\n \n Qur&#8217;an 3:56 &#8220;As for those disbelieving infidels, I will punish them with a terrible agony in this world and the next.

Enroll us among the witnesses.&#8217; But the Christians contrived a plot and Allah did the same; but Allah&#8217;s plot was the best.&#8221;\n \n Qur&#8217;an 8:12 &#8220;Your Lord inspired the angels with the message: &#8216;I will terrorize the unbelievers. Therefore smite them on their necks and every joint and incapacitate them. Strike off their heads and cut off each of their fingers and toes.&#8221;\n \n Qur&#8217;an 8:58 &#8220;If you apprehend treachery from any group on the part of a people (with whom you have a treaty), retaliate by breaking off (relations) with them. The infidels should not think they can bypass (Islamic law or the punishment of Allah).

In regards to the upcoming inauguration - its not just that President-Elect Obama may or may not utter something religious but that a Christian minister has been invited to speak. Obama will be officialy taking over as president and will be making a promise to Americans - all of them. Maybe he shouldn't be restricted in his own words - but this is an official government function and I think the minister ought to go.\n \n I would also like to take a minute to giggle and ponder here. I wonder how many Christians who are offended that there are those who want references to Christendom removed from the inauguration are the same ones who were mortified that Senator Ellingson (a Muslim) chose to swear on the Qur'an rather than the Bible when he took office.

Are you prepared to tell me -- after all the forceful criticisms you've made of my religious views over the last week or so -- that you do not believe my view of Christianity to be profoundly ignorant? Forgive me, Archie, but I find that very hard to believe.\n \n I'll tell you what, though. You cut the sanctimony of calling me \"spiritually dead\" or an \"alleged Christian\" and I'll cut the sanctimony of calling you \"authoritarian\" or a \"self-styled prophet.\" Whaddya say?\n \n \nAnd of what importance is it what most moslems personally believe, when we are discussing what the religion teaches and stands for? I say this because I know personally that nobody in my family thinks like radical moslems do.\n\n \n So, suppose you're talking with your Muslim family members about what Islam \"teaches and stands for\" in relation to Christianity and Judaism. You say what you wrote earlier: \"The obvious evidence of that is they consider both belief systems [Judaism and Christianity] to be made up of infidels whom they are dedicated to wiping off of the face of the Earth\" (emphases added).\n \n Would \"they\" regard that as either a fair or a reasonable characterization of their faith, insofar as \"they\" don't think like radical Muslims?\n \n \nBut islam still teaches these atrocities which so clearly conflict with Judaism and Christianity.\n\n \n Does \"Islam\" teach these things? Or do \"radical Muslims?\" Per your own description of your family, isn't there a difference here?\n \n \nSo try to stay on point if that's at all possible, for once.\n\n \n Well, I do try! But I don't think I'm the one who needs this reminder.\n \n I mean, let me get this straight. I think that the sacred scriptures of my own religion are fallible. I believe that some of those scriptures reflect the hateful prejudices of their authors, but that this need not imply that my religion \"teaches and stands for\" hatred. And yet, you quote passages from the holy book of another religion, as if doing so would be enough to convince me that that religion \"teaches and stands for\" hatred?\n \n Come now, Archie! I know I've only been here for a few days, but surely you know me better than that! What would you imagine is my response? Isn't it pretty obvious?...",

   "So if I say \"yesterday when I drove to work ...\" in the course of a conversation, you actually think that's an act of endorsing automobiles? Come on. No.\n\n \n This may come as a shock, but: I agree with you. Because it's the context that's important here. Similarly, it's context that's importance in the inauguration case. When the president is speaking in his official capacity as the president, I don't think reference to religious ideas is at all appropriate.\n \n \nWe're talking about religion in public comments due to religion's ubiquitous nature, not someone standing up saying \"you should be religious\" or \"so-and-so religion is the correct one\". ... When someone holds up a bottle of Windex and says \"this product is what you should use\" or \"I recommend Windex\", THAT'S endorsing. When someone says \"so help me god\" after taking their oath, that's not endorsing.\n\n \n But I'm not sure endorsement need be so explicit. Yes, sure, in the sense of endorsing a product, okay. But in the case of an idea, endorsement comes from use. And heck, in that sense products can be endorsed by use, too. When the president speaks of God, he is implying, however non-forcefully, that on the question of theism and atheism, theism is correct and atheism is not. It's one thing for him to do this in a non-official context, and quite another for him to do it in the official context of the oath of office.\n \n \nIt's not technically the government's job or the president's job to talk about the White House dog. But it's been known to come up publicly in a press conference.\n\n \n How many offical utterances involve the White House dog?\n \n \nIt's technically not really the government's job to mention one's wife or family, but a president often acknowledges his wife at a State of the Union speech.\n\n \n Ditto.\n \n \nIf officials are to be restricted to never speak of things that it's technically not the government's job to talk about, then that's pretty darn unreasonable and overly-restrictive.\n\n \n Again with the shocker: I agree.\n \n But I did not say that they should never speak of things that it's technically not the government's job to talk about! I have tried to make a distinction between official speaking contexts -- those situations in which the agent is fulfilling the duties of his office -- and unofficial speaking contexts -- those in which he's not. Different constraints apply in the two different contexts.\n \n I think the oath of office is an official context, and therefore the level of constraint is high.\n \n \nGovernment consists of people--it's not some mechanical machine. We have to let them be human...\n\n \n Agreed again!\n \n \n... and we mustn't try to sterilize public discourse with some Anything-But-Theism approach.\n\n \n Three points. First, what exactly do you mean by \"sterilize?\" I'm not sure how dropping things like \"so help me God\" or \"In God We Trust\" would render anything \"sterile.\" Could you explain what you think is lost there?\n \n Second, I'm not talking about constraining \"public\" discourse. I'm talking about constraining governmental or official discourse. There is, as I see it, quite a difference. Religious discussion can happen in all sorts of public venues, from airwaves to eateries.\n \n Third, I'm not sure that \"anything-but-theism\" is the right way to characterize this. On my view, the president also shouldn't endorse atheism.\n \n \nTheism and religion are a huge part of life...\n\n \n They are a huge part of some people's lives, more accurately speaking.\n \n \n... and you might as well be demanding people not talk about their family or anything else ubiquitous.\n\n \n But as I said, I have no interest in making any such demand! I'm asking that people in government not talk about religion when fulfilling their official functions.\n \n \nGovernment consists of people, Matthew. When you say you don't want government to utter anything religious, that means people.\n\n \n But again, you ignore the qualification of official context.\n \n \n ...what you've been arguing: essentially to eliminate all religious-speak whatsoever and therefore impose upon officials to keep something that is a major part of life experience in the closet.\n\n \n Not what I've been arguing!\n \n \nThere's a huge difference between legislation and ceremony, to where the two shouldn't really even be in the same sentence in this case. There are any number of things that have to be kept out of legislation. No one here is talking about legislation, and it's not even part of this discussion. The article had nothing whatsoever to do with policy-making. The problem here is that some are now going farther than that to keeping the mentioning of their faith banished from public statements altogether. And that is being unreasonable, IMO.\n\n \n But what I think links legislation and ceremony is the official context. When those in question are fulfilling their official responsibilities, religious ideas should not be invoked.",

   "[Addressing T.Q.:] Is this your simplistic way of saying that anytime a pastor prays before the congregation he's sinning, or being like the Pharisees?\n\n \n Good question.\n \n You see, as I read the verses in question, they include houses of worship. This is because the text says, \"And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\"\n \n I grant you that the recommendation is broader than that. But synagogues are houses of worship. And I don't see an exemption for worship leaders.\n \n Perhaps there is such an exemption? Perhaps such leaders are ipso facto not hypocrites, else they wouldn't be leaders?\n \n Or perhaps public prayer is just going through the motions? externally visible but internally meaningless? and thus completely unnecessary?\n \n Lotta possibilities, I'd say. And which one is right is most certainly not settled just by reading the text. And especially not by reading the text and then baptizing one's own interpretation as the ostensibly \"literal\" one.\n \n \nSo by Rick Warren giving the invocation at a public event like the inauguration is also sinning?\n\n \n Another good question.\n \n The injunction includes mention of an intention: \"that they may be seen\" -- by other people, of course. But what does being seen by other people matter? Perhaps public prayer is not to be performed, because it's ultimately self-defeating: even if done in good faith, it is an attempt to exhibit outwardly that which could only be ascertained inwardly.\n \n Or maybe not, but the text itself certainly isn't decisive here.\n \n \nOr was Jesus talking about individuals who literally stood on street corners or in church and prayed loudly so everyone could see and hear them praying publicly. Which is precisely what He was saying.\n\n \n Yet another good question. I suppose it certainly could be. But the text itself makes no mention of \"loudly.\" It just mentions praying in such a way that you could be observed doing so.\n \n \nYou people have this special ability to pull any verses out of context and completely pervert their meaning to fit your warped agendas.\n\n \n And you seem to have a special ability to claim that verses can only reasonably be interpreted in such a way that they fit your agenda.\n \n I don't think your interpretation is necessarily wrong (at least not where this passage is concerned).

   "Once again, you are ripping a passage out of context in order to make a fallacious point. That Passage in Matthew 6 is speaking to individuals about how to have a sincere and proper relationship with God. He is also commenting on what was a common practice of the day, and even today of certain people attempting to appear religious by their outward and public expressions of religiosity. \n \n This isn't to condemn public invocations at large events where many people gather at all. Neither is it condemning Pastors for leading their church in prayer during a service. Neither is it condemning believers from praying publicly in church when the Spirit has something to share with the group through them.\n \n This passage is warning against the hypocrites who do these things for human recognition but are not led by the spirit at all, and since God knows the condition of our hearts and judges our motives, He will judge us on that basis. So this verse has no bearing on this public invocation which isn't being performed in order to glorify the individuals saying the prayers, but is being offered to honor the God whom Obama is ostensibly thanking for bringing him to and trusting with this great responsibility as our new President. \n \n Matthew 6 is also when Jesus taught His followers how to pray. Starting with verse 7, it also tells them how not to pray like the pagans. He is also warning those rich Jews who went to Temple and made an issue of their large tithes so that all the people knew how much he gave for personal recognition of his generosity. In another passage, Jesus said that the old woman who gave 10 cents had given more than the rich man who gave a hundred dollars because where as he gave from his excess, she gave all she had to God. So read the whole passage in proper context to get what it is actually saying rather than what you want it to say.\n Matthew 6\n \n 1\"Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.\n 2\"So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. 3But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\n \n [I]5\"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. 6But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 7And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 8Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.\n 9\"This, then, is how you should pray:[I] \n \" 'Our Father in heaven, \n hallowed be your name, \n 10your kingdom come, \n your will be done \n on earth as it is in heaven. \n 11Give us today our daily bread. \n 12Forgive us our debts, \n as we also have forgiven our debtors. \n 13And lead us not into temptation, \n but deliver us from the evil one.[a]' 14For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.\n \n 16\"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. 17But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, 18so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\n So although I'm not surprised that Matthew and Jo, my fellow christians emoticon_wow would agree with tq's corruption of that passage, it should be obvious to any objective observer that when read in proper context, it has nothing at all to do with a Pastor praying a prayer of invocation at an inaugural celebration for an incoming President of the USA, or any other type of public event where God is being recognized for His Lordship over this great country.",

However, it's just interesting to me that only now some are making an issue of these inaugurations from the standpoint of church and state separation when in fact these minister-led benedictions in presidential inaugurations have been going on since the FDR administration. Some of these people need to call their objection what it is: they really just flat-out don't like the fact it's an evangelical minister who isn't for gay marriage that's doing it.

Also, because the UK is not as actively religious as the US, the use of religion in public life does not have the same effect - religious references in state ceremonies are largely ritual, there is little impact in terms of what we are discussing - using public prayer to show others how religious you are, as well as the simple fact that it is ritual and pretty much compulsory, rather than a choice on the part of elected officials, makes it far less likely to be used for that purpose.",

Please refer to Chester's Questions for Bible-thumpers for guidelines.\n \n As for staying on topic: since there is no God, it is rather pointless to have religious ceremonies in any case, isn't it?\n \n As for my nom de Web, you have missed the point altogether. Either you are not quick on the uptake and/or you are completely ignorant of the Japanese language. Hint: surely you have seen the starry emblem on all Subaru cars?\n \n To end on a conciliatory note: I entirely agree with the last sentence of your posting [except the punctuation].\n \n -",
