   "Since our entire economy is based almost entirely on consumer confidence, I find these particularly interesting:\n \n http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050929/RCREDIT29/TPBusiness/Canadian\n \n \nWASHINGTON -- The high price of gas already has consumers feeling a lot less confident and with another surge in energy prices yesterday, economists are watching for signs the price shock is enough to get people to actually change the way they live and spend.\n \n \"Consumers have to adjust their budgets,\" insisted economist Peter Morici, a business professor at the University of Maryland in College Park, Md. \"Something is going to have to give.\"\n \n The first hint of a consumer pullback is likely to show up in purchases of non-essential goods and services, including apparel, cars and leisure travel, according to Prof. Morici. He also predicted there would be changes in behaviour as people drive less, buy more fuel efficient cars, car pool and turn to public transit.\n\n \n http://www.kbsd6.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=KBSD/MGArticle/BSD_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1031785344069&path=\n \n \nHigh gas prices, hurricane recovery, it doesn't mean all Americans have less money, but they may be spending less of it. The latest numbers show the Consumer Confidence Index fell to it's lowest level in 15 years. Wichita State Marketing expert Cindy Claycomb, says that's a number that's tough to judge. It can be either a perception that people are cutting back or a reality.\n \n \"You know, everything may be, I won't say ok, but everything could be where we're not in a lot of trouble but people just have this sense of gloom and that can affect consumer confidence.\" \n \n \n EVERYTHING in the US economy depends on consumer confidence, and to anybody who actually runs the numbers and studies the trends, \"irrational exuberance\" is putting it lightly. A sharp fall in consumer confidence woul send the stock market to the basement and the housing bublle could over-correct by as much as 70%.\n \n http://www.idexonline.com/\n \n \nIn the aftermath hurricane Katrina, the U.S. Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which had rebounded in August, dropped in September to 86.6 from 105.5 in August. \n \n \"Hurricane Katrina, coupled with soaring gasoline prices and a less optimistic job outlook, has pushed consumer confidence to its lowest level in nearly two years (81.7 in October 2003) and created a degree of uncertainty and concern about the short-term future,\" says Lynn Franco, Director of The Board's Consumer Research Center.\n \n The Present Situation Index decreased to 108.9 from 123.8. The Expectations Index fell to 71.7 from 93.3 last month. \n \n \n Not good numbers, unless you are looking for cheap domestic help.",

I am guessing that by years end, though, consumer confidence will be in the toilet. People are NOT going to handle the heating fuel price increases well. If gas prices are enough to drive people off the credit card deep end, their winter heating bill on top of that will drive them off the deep end.\n \n Somebody here pointed out that Natural gas prices are already up 100%. I was speaking with an industrial process consultant today who was saying that CW is that they will double again between now and January. Apparently his phone has been ringing off the hook with customers looking for ways to cut back on fuel usage for processes. In the end, they will just have to raise prices at the consumer level. \n \n I think Gamhuis may be right about some degree of currency manipulation going on with the dollar. The movements we have seen simply defy logic. I halted my currency trading activities for now. Watching the market, it almost looks like the asians are doing the playing (based soley on the hours I am seeing abberations). If it is indeed the asians pushing the dollar, I am little fearful they are doing so in order to get maximum value for their dollars in a sellout. The signs have been pointing in such a direction for a long time now, and I am not willing to risk being stuck in bad positions when the selloff comes.

MASSIVE government spending in order to pump GDP is about the only way to keep the public complacent for another year. \n \n I woudl imagine half a trillion in public spending for hurricane relief and the Iraq war when all is said and done, which will pump our GDP admirably. I think it may even work. After all, how many times have we seen fools wander in here and claim that our high GDP is the be-all-end-all sign of economic prosperity. We must remember that the American public is not especially bright. \n \n Additionally I think that a war with Iran is neearly a foregone conclusion. The indicators I have seen show that people are lined up around the block to get in on their Euro based oil market, set to open next year. The US government will not tolerate a petro euro. I am not sure how well that one will go voer with the Us public, though. With the IRaqi fisaco so recent, and the fact that no thinking person still supprots that mess or believes the BS we were fed to get us there, a war with Iran may prove to be a tough sell.",

   "I think the US will be in an official recession in 6 months with no options for preventing it. From already low interest rates, to heavy government spending the government has few options left to effectively stimulate the economy without hurting the long term health of the US economy.\n \n \n From higher interest rates and inflation the US consumer will for this occasion be hard to fool. Not being able to pay your bills from heating, electricity to paying for gas for your car is not something the government can hide from. Neither will consumers as the minimum monthly payment for credit cards in the states is going to be doubled very soon. The ability of consumers to live on borrowed time will be hurt no matter what. Consumer Confidience numbers seem to reflect that.\n \n As for Iran if their are any bright people left in the US government, the prospects of $140 USD per barrel for oil should be a scary prospect. Iran would not go down without a fight, its oil would be removed from the market, Iraq's already stressed supply would in all likely hood be reduced by half, and I expect that the Straights of Hormuz would be cluttered with the remains of large oil tankers. Iran I believe would also launch a few long range missiles and guerilla attacks on the Oil fields of Saudi Arabia further reducing world wide supply. Venezuela has very recently moved its CB reserves to Europe, and just might stop exports to the US as a response to an attack on Iran.\n \n Which means that an attack on Iran could very well result in a world wide recession that could mirror the great depression in overall strength. While I know that many in the US government and Israeli government are orgasmic over the prospect of attacking Iran, I hope that their are enough sane people left in the US government to limit those ideologes power.",

   "The neo-cons are dying to attack Iran, but for the reasons listed by daewoo and Lord Tammerlain they just can't do it.\n Another reason is that the Shias in the Iraqi government and the Iraqi army will be ****** off when their Shia brothers in Iran get attacked. \n An attack on Iran would threaten the lives of all American soldiers that are serving in Iraq. The Iraqi soldiers that are currently going on missions side by side with the Americans will turn around and kill the Americans the moment Iran gets attacked. The US government knows this, which is why the Iraqis haven't gotten any substantial military hardware yet.\n \n The US government is between a rock and a hard place.

Unfortunately we still have idiot posters on this board defending our (US) invasion and occupation of Iraq with current administration showing little regard for public opinion or domestic economic requirements, so who really knows how the public would react to a staged Iranian attack on say Israel. What's left of the middle class is desperately trying to retain their bloated yet devalued standard of living in the face of shrinking job markets while lower classes are struggling to even meet increases in gas, residential heating and food costs. This administration has proven a little fear goes a long way in controlling the public while creating a two-tiered society. \n \n Due to Katrina government spending and debt expansion requirements will remain at abnormally high levels, sure to generate market demands of increased interest rates.

They need to attack Iran to boost the GDP and to prevent the creation of the Iranian Oil Bourse, but at the same time they just can't do it for all the reasons that have been listed in this thread.\n\n \n I think the big issue a this point is the oil. The US has been exporting currency for years, and has been able to treat it as a manufactured good because there was always an increasing demand for it in order to purchase oil. If even 25% of the worlds oil was bought and sold in Euros instead of the USD, it would have crushing effects on the dollar (currently about 4% of oil transactions are non dollar based). As the dollar takes a nose dive, prices for dollar purchased oil go up anyway. $170 oil may be a foregone conclusion at this point, regardless of whether we invade Iran or not. A petroeuro is an incredible threat to the US economy.\n \n \nBut maybe there's a way out for the US government.

S America may well be the next area that we \"liberate\". I just don't see the odds of a sucessful campaign in Iran being in our favor. Unlike Iraq, Iran ius a dog that has teeth, and with thier recent treaty with Syria, they have teeth and modern Russian weaponry.\n \n The Iraq blunder really painted us into a corner as far as dealing with Iran. Besides the fact that following Iraq the Iranians, Syrains, and pretty much everybody else in the ME who did not want to become an Americn coloiny hardened their defenses, international support for an invasion of Iran is likely to be non-existant. I seriously doubt that we will see any real action form the UNSC against Iran, since china, russia, germany, france, and even the british are keen to do their oil buying in euros..",
