   "Mississippi Humor\n \n The owner of a golf course in Natchez was confused about paying an invoice,\n so he decided to ask his secretary for some mathematical help. He called \n her into his office and said, \"You graduated from Ms State and I need some \n help. If I were to give you $20,000, minus 14 % how much would you take \n off?\" The secretary thought a moment, and then replied, \"Everything but \n my earrings.\"\n You gotta love those Mississippi women.\n ***********************************************************************\n A group of Mississippi friends went deer hunting and paired off in twos for\n the day. That night, one of the hunters returned alone, staggering under \n the weight of an eight-point buck. \"Where's Henry?\" the others asked. \n \"Henry had a stroke of some kind. He's a couple of miles back up the \n trail,\" the successful hunter replied. \"You left Henry laying out there \n and carried the deer back?\" they inquired. \"A tough call,\" nodded the \n hunter. \"But I figured no one is going to steal Henry!\"\n ***********************************************************************\n Regarding the year 2000, a senior at Mississippi State was overheard \n saying \"When the end of the world comes, I hope to be in Mississippi.\" \n When asked why, he stated that everything happens here 20 years \n later than the rest of the civilized world.\n ***********************************************************************\n The young Crystal Springs man came running into the store and said to his\n buddy, \"Bubba, somebody just stole your pickup truck from the parking lot!\" \n Bubba replied, \"Did you see who it was?\" The young Redneck answered. \"I \n couldn't tell, but I got the license number.\"\n \n ***********************************************************************\n * NEWS FLASH - Mississippi's worst air disaster occurred when a small\n two-seater Cessna 150 plane, piloted by two Co-Lin students, crashed into \n a cemetery earlier today. Search and rescue workers have recovered 300 \n bodies so far and expect the number to climb as digging continues into the \n evening. The pilot and copilot survived and are helping in the recovery \n efforts.\n ***********************************************************************\n * A Mississippi State Trooper pulled over a pickup on 1-40. The trooper\n asked \"Got any ID?\" The driver replied, \"Bout whut?\"\n ***********************************************************************\n * A Greenwood man had a flat tire, pulled off on the side of the road, and\n proceeded to put a bouquet of flowers in front of the car and one behind it.\n Then he got back in the car to wait. A passerby studied the scene as he \n drove by and was so curious he turned around and went back. He asked the \n fellow what the problem was. The man replied, \"I have a flat tire.\" The \n passerby asked, \"But what's with the flowers?\" The man responded, \"When\n you break down they tell you to put flares in the front and flares in the back!\n I never did understand it either.\"\n ***********************************************************************",
