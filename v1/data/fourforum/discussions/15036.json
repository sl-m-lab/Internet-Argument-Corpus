   "Hawaii Same-Sex Civil Unions Bill Approved By State Legislature\nHONOLULU - The Hawaii Legislature approved a bill on Wednesday allowing civil unions for same-sex couples, sending the measure to the governor, who has said he will sign it into law.\n \n Democratic Gov. Neil Abercrombie's office said he intends to sign the bill within 10 days, and civil unions would begin Jan. 1, 2012.\n \n \"I have always believed that civil unions respect our diversity, protect people's privacy, and reinforce our core values of equality and aloha,\" Abercrombie said in a statement released minutes after Wednesday's vote. \"For me, this bill represents equal rights for all the people of Hawai'i.\"\n \n The Senate's 18-5 vote came after years of thousands-strong rallies, election battles and passionate public testimony on an issue that has divided the Rainbow State for nearly two decades.\n \n The measure grants gay and lesbian couples the same rights and benefits the state provides to married couples.\n \n Hawaii would become the seventh state to grant essentially the same rights of marriage to same-sex couples without authorizing marriage itself.\n \n Five states and the District of Columbia permit same-sex marriage.\n \n The anxiously awaited civil unions vote came immediately after the Senate confirmed the state's first openly gay Supreme Court justice, Sabrina McKenna.\n \n Gay rights advocates praised the vote as a victory for equal rights in a state known for its diversity and tolerance.\n",

At least Christ's resurrection is documented.\n \n \nYeah, documented by contradictory accounts. Remember our argument about Matthew and Luke? Where did those apostles first see jesus afer the resurrection? Was it Jerusalem or Galilee? \n\n \n As far as I recall your argument was baseless.\n \n The truth is, Jesus met with His disciples in both places, but He did so at different times. One of the reasons so many people allege that two or more Bible passages are contradictory is because they fail to recognize that mere differences do not necessitate a contradiction. For there to be a bona fide contradiction, not only must one be referring to the same person, place, or thing in the same sense, but the same time period must be under consideration. If a person looks at a single door in the back of a building and says, &#8220;That door is shut,&#8221; but also says, &#8220;That door is open,&#8221; has he contradicted himself? Not necessarily. The door may have been shut at one moment, but then opened the next by a strong gust of wind. Time and chronology are important factors to consider when dealing with alleged errors in the Bible.\n \n Jesus met with His disciples both in Jerusalem and in Galilee, but at different times. On the day of His resurrection, He met with all of the apostles (except Thomas) in Jerusalem just as both Luke and John recorded (Luke 24:33-43; John 20:19-25). Since Jesus was on the Earth for only forty days following His resurrection (cf. Acts 1:3), sometime between this meeting with His apostles in Jerusalem and His ascension more than five weeks later, Jesus met with seven of His disciples at the Sea of Tiberias in Galilee (John 21:1-14), and later with all eleven of the apostles on a mountain in Galilee that Jesus earlier had appointed for them (Matthew 28:16). Sometime following these meetings in Galilee, Jesus and His disciples traveled back to Judea, where He ascended into heaven from the Mount of Olives near Bethany (Luke 24:50-53; Acts 1:9-12).\n \n None of the accounts of Jesus&#8217; post-resurrection appearances contradicts another. Rather, each writer supplemented what a different writer left out. Jesus may have appeared to the disciples a number of times during the forty days on Earth after His resurrection (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:1-7), while the New Testament writers mentioned only the more prominent instances in order to substantiate the fact of His resurrection.\n \n Still, one may ask, &#8220;Why did Jesus command His apostles to &#8216;tarry in the city of Jerusalem&#8217; on the day of His resurrection until they were &#8216;endued with power from on high&#8217; (Luke 24:49), if He really wanted them to meet Him in Galilee?&#8221; Actually, it is an assumption to assert that Jesus made the above statement on the same day that He arose from the grave. One thing we must keep in mind as we study the Bible is that it normally is not as concerned about chronology as modern-day writings. Frequently (especially in the gospel accounts), writers went from one subject to the next without giving the actual time or the exact order in which something was done or taught (cf. Luke 4:1-3; Matthew 4:1-11). In Luke 24, the writer omitted the post-resurrection appearances of Jesus in Galilee (mentioned by both Matthew and John). However, notice that he never stated that Jesus remained only in Jerusalem from the day He rose from the grave until the day He ascended up into heaven.\n \n According to Luke 24 verses 1,13,21,29, and 33, the events recorded in the first forty-three verses of that chapter all took place on the very day of Jesus&#8217; resurrection (cf. 24:1,13,21,29,33). The last four verses of Luke 24 (vss. 50-53), however, took place (according to Luke) more than five weeks later (cf. Acts 1:1-12). But what about verses 44-49? When were these statements made? The truth is, no one can know for sure. Luke gives no indication (as he did in the preceding verses) that this particular section took place &#8220;on the first day of the week&#8221; (24:1), or on &#8220;the third day&#8221; since Jesus&#8217; crucifixion (24:21). All we know is that verses 44-49 took place sometime before He ascended into heaven (vss. 50-51). Simply because Luke used the Greek conjunctive particle de [translated &#8220;and&#8221; (ASV), &#8220;then&#8221; (NKJV), and &#8220;now&#8221; (NASV)] to begin verse 44, does not necessarily denote a close connection between the two verses, but only a general continuation of the account and a brief statement of what Jesus said. Even though many twenty-first-century readers assume that the events recorded in Luke 24:44-49 occurred on the very day Jesus rose from the grave, the text actually is silent on the matter.
