   "I believe each of us is a product of our environment.\n \n Several years ago I had a weekly continual dinner conversation over a span of about two years with a friend regarding a hypothetical experiment wherein a child is born into a life support box that provides food, air, water, light, waste disposal and a survivable climate. We would spend hours after dinner, toasting our own health and well being and discussing what we thought the child would learn on its own throughout several years of confinement. I concluded that the child would learn very little if anything aside from where the food and water came from...and that only the survival instinct would keep it alive.\n \n We then expanded the \"experiment\" to what a person might learn as it grew up alone in the world, with no other humans.\n \n Later still we expanded the scene to include two humans...then a small group...then a large group. \n \n The exercise brought out a lot of conversation regarding parental input, peer input, historical data, language, art, music, science, inventions and other things that we learn from others and from books.\n \n It was essentially an entertainment tool for us and produced no conclusions that could be stated with any degree of confidence, but it was fun while it lasted...and we enjoyed many fine cigars together. It did reinforce our common belief that the environment in which a child develops will determine what kind of person the child turns into.\n \n Not that this relates totally to your question, but I believe the character of the child is directly related to the character values to which it is exposed in the formative years. I've noted exceptions to this in some families where the child went totally astray from the parents so I suppose no hard and fast rules apply.\n \n I do believe this thread belongs on another forum.",

Besides, it would be difficult to compare what they might learn in isolation as opposed to a normal upbringing because I have no idea what they should have learned anyway.\n \n I've seen on nature shows where a momma cat (leopard) teaches the young to hunt and kill. (Polar bears, too.) I suspect that the isolated cat would continue to come to whatever food source is provided and never seek an alternate diet or means of obtaining food. Then again, a hungry dog will try to eat a brick.\n \n The stories that have been documented about orphaned geese and the use of ultra-light aircraft to teach them to fly south in the winter are amazing...but geese don't nurse...they start eating whatever's available shortly after hatching. I think the only reason young geese in the wild fly south for the first time is because all the other geese went that way.\n \n I've seen one story about saving the California Condor in which \"mommy looking\" hand puppets were used to \"regurgitate\" food to the young hatchlings. I don't remember how they developed their flying skills, but I understand several have been successfully released into the wild.\n \n I think animals have many more behaviors attributed to instinct than do we. Most of the reptiles I'm aware of are on their own when born or hatched. How does a baby rattler know that his fangs can be used to kill a rat?\n \n Alligators don't get any parental training. Neither do snakes or turtles. They just strike out on their own. Most fish receive very little parental care. Salmon certainly don't get any. I've heard of some fish whose parents will protect them by storing them in their big fat mouths, but I've never heard of any fish teaching its young what or how to eat unless those who hang around their parents learn by watching them eat other fish.\n \n Speaking of turtles, how do they know to return to the same beach to lay eggs? How do salmon find the stream of their own birth after being at sea for years?\n \n I think most all animals and insects have an instinctive drive to survive...after all, you start trying to stomp on a cockroach and he scurries for cover...you capture a cricket in your hand and he tries to get away (and often does before I get the hook in)...garden spiders will run from an approaching lawn mower...almost any healthy animal that doesn't consider you to be food or see you as a threat to their young will run when approached. Even your neighbor's dog will be wary of you until he gains confidence that you are not out to hurt him.",
