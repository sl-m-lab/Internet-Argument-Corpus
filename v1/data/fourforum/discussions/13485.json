   "Bill making violence against gays a hate crime headed to White House -- latimes.com\nA bill to make violence against gays and lesbians a federal hate crime cleared the Senate on Thursday and headed to the White House.\n \n The 68-29 vote was a victory for civil rights groups that have long sought to expand the federal statute beyond attacks motivated by religion, race, color or national origin.\n \n The bill, which President Obama is expected to sign, includes penalties for assaults based on a victim's sexual orientation, gender, disability or gender identity.\n \n Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr., whose Justice Department would be charged with enforcing the provisions, praised the bill's passage.\n \n \"There have been nearly 80,000 hate-crime incidents reported to the FBI since I first testified before Congress in support of a hate-crimes bill 11 years ago,\" Holder said.\n \n Recent incidents -- such as the June shooting death of an African American security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum by a white supremacist -- \"demonstrate that there are still those for whom prejudice can translate into violence,\" he said.\n \n The legislation also would give federal authorities more power to help state and local law enforcement officials investigate hate crimes and would expand the federal government's ability to intervene. About 45 states have hate-crime statutes.\n \n The bill, which was attached to a $680-billion measure outlining the Pentagon's budget, was passed by the House on Oct. 8.\n \n Some of the 28 Republicans who opposed it said they didn't like being forced to vote on the issue as part of a defense bill.\n \n \"It's a shame that this piece of legislation was added to a bill that's supposed to be about supporting our troops,\" said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.).\n \n The defense bill includes $130 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and authorizes a 3.4% pay raise for the military.\n \n The bill would also make it a federal crime to attack members of the military because of their service.\n \n The hate-crime measure is named for Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming who was beaten to death in 1998, and for James Byrd Jr., an African American in Texas who was chained to a pickup and dragged to death the same year.\n \n \"It has been more than 10 years since the senseless and brutal death of Matthew Shepard,\" said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), \"and I look forward to watching President Obama sign this much-needed legislation into law.\"\n",

   "It has nothing to do with the \"importance\" of a particular victim. It's terrorism. It's sending a message to a group.

   "Hate against everyone isn't terrorism, it's mental instability. The term \"hate crime\" is meaningless in such a case. It's not \"singling out\" a group -- you can't \"single out\" everyone. It's a contradiction in terms. The \"hate criminal\" is saying \"this is what's going to happen to you ________s\", meaning a sub-set of the whole, typically a minority he deems inferior to some \"normal\" majority, not just himself. Mad-at-the-world \"I'm gonna kill 'em all\" psychos are relatively rare, compared to those who target minorites solely for being the minorities they are. (The term \"hate crime\" is a misnomer in any event. They're actually bias crimes. To be biased against everyone but yourself is just nonsensical.)\n \n And race-motivated crimes DO still happen, if not to the extent--against blacks at least--that they once did. (And if that's the case, who's to say bias laws aren't at least partially responsible for their reduction?) But even if they didn't still happen, gay-targetted crimes unquestionably do, so your argument about the law's origin is pointless. Just because one group might not need it anymore isn't an argument against another group needing it now.\n \n In any event, hate crime laws are not going to be done away with any time soon, and as long as they're not, and as long as certain groups--be they black, Jewish, gay, crippled, obese, or whatever, can be demonstrated to be targetted in above-normative numbers as victims, I don't see why they should not be included in such legislation, or what detriment is caused by including a new group that has been shown to be so victimized. If you want to argue for the the elimination of ALL so-called hate-crimes as ineffectively dissuasive, that's one thing. You could argue that about the death penalty as well.\n \n But that's not the motive behind the overwhelming majority of objections to including gays in such legislation. The protest comes virtually exclusively from right-wing religious Christians who are already covered by such legislation, and would hypocritically protest to beat the band if removed from their inclusion in it--regardless of its effectiveness, or whether Christians can be demonstrated in the first place to be victims of criminal bias (in this country, anyway) to anywhere near the extent that other groups patently have and are... e.g., blacks, Jews--and gays.",

   " gay-targetted crimes unquestionably do, so your argument about the law's origin is pointless. Just because one group might not need it anymore isn't an argument against another group needing it now. \n\n \n Yes it is. During the 1960s, crimes against blacks were occuring with the support of certain states (by their refusal to prosecute those involved) so a law inforced by another level of government independent of the state was required. Please show me a state today which is complicit in attacks on gays. As far as the motives of the majority of hate-crime bill opponents, I could not disagree with you on that if I tried. Fortunately, I am not defending the position of someone who has been watching the 700 Club too much. \n \n \n If you want to argue for the the elimination of ALL so-called hate-crimes as ineffectively dissuasive, that's one thing \n\n \n That is what I'm arguing. I'm not concerned that gays are be added to hate-crimes laws. I'm concerned that any hate-crimes laws exist in the first place. If we are all supposed to be equal in the eyes of the law, there should be an absolute and known need to elevate certain individuals or groups in the eyes of the law.\n \n \n You could argue that about the death penalty as well. \n\n \n For every study that shows the death penalty has no effect on crime there is one that shows the exact opposite. The fact is nearly all such studies on both sides are done by people with an agenda. Besides, deterence is only half the reason behind capital punishment. The second being just that... punishment. If you do something wrong that negatively affects another individual, you are punished in relation to the extent of the crime. Simple.",

   "Hate Crimes Bill Signed Into Law 11 Years After Matthew Shepard's Death \n \n Excerpt: \n\"When Dennis and I started calling 10 years ago for federal action to prevent and properly prosecute hate crimes against gay, lesbian and transgendered Americans, we never imagined it would take this long,\" said Judy Shepard, Matthew's mother and the president of the Matthew Shepard Foundation Board of Directors. \n \n \"The legislation went through so many versions and so many votes that we had to constantly keep our hopes in check to keep from getting discouraged,\" she continued. \"But with President Obama's support and the continually growing bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate lining up behind the bill this year, it became clear that 2009 was the year it would finally happen.\"\n \n The legislation allows federal authorities to pursue charges in violent crimes motivated by the victim's actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and disability, in cases where local authorities cannot or will not secure appropriate convictions. It also opens up federal aid to local law enforcement for training, prevention and investigation.\n \n \"We are incredibly grateful to Congress and the president for taking this step forward on behalf of hate crime victims and their families, especially given the continuing attacks on people simply for living their lives openly and honestly,\" Shepard added. \"But each of us can and must do much more to ensure true equality for all Americans.\"\n",

   "Popping out babies is all that really matters according to conservative leaders-\n \n Evangelicals rally behind Palin after pregnancy news\n Story Highlights\n Sarah Palin, John McCain oppose abortion, have supported abstinence education\n \n Palin confirms Monday that her 17-year-old daughter is pregnant\n \n Evangelical leaders voicing support for Palin\n \n James Dobson: All this shows is that Palin \"and her family are human\"\n \n By Rebecca Sinderbrand\n CNN\n ST. PAUL, Minnesota (CNN) -- Key evangelical leaders rallied to Sarah Palin's support Monday amid news that her 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, was having a child.\n \n \"Before, they were excited about her, with the Down syndrome baby,\" conservative, anti-tax activist Grover Norquist said. \"But now with this, they are over the moon. It reinforces the fact that this family lives its pro-life values.\"\n \n Palin and John McCain oppose abortion and have supported promoting abstinence in schools, which would seem to make Bristol Palin's pregnancy an inconveniently timed development.\n \n But she is keeping the child, a fact that could make the Alaska governor -- whose candidacy has been enthusiastically embraced by evangelicals who regard her as one of their own -- even more popular among that key GOP voting bloc. Watch more on Palin's announcement >>\n \n \"Fortunately, Bristol is following her mother and father's example of choosing life in the midst of a difficult situation,\" Family Research Council president Tony Perkins said. \"We are committed to praying for Bristol and her husband-to-be and the entire Palin family as they walk through a very private matter in the eyes of the public.\"\n \n Evangelical leader Richard Land also backed Palin completely.\n \n \"This is the pro-life choice. The fact that people will criticize her for this shows the astounding extent to which the secular critics of the pro-life movement just don't get it,\" Land said in a statement.\n \n \"Those who criticize the Palin family don't understand that we don't see babies as a punishment but as a blessing. Barack Obama said that if one of his daughters made a mistake and got pregnant out of wedlock, he wouldn't want her to be punished with a child. Pro-lifers don't see a child as punishment.\"\n \n The immediate support of these major figures, who offered universal praise for the Palins' actions after learning their daughter was pregnant, provides the filter through which conservative Christian voters will process the development. iReport.com: Were you married at a young age?\n \n Most important for Palin, an elder statesman of the movement, Focus on the Family founder James Dobson, released a statement lauding the Palins for acting in keeping with the group's policies and practices:\n \n \"We have always encouraged the parents to love and support their children and always advised the girls to see their pregnancies through, even though there will of course be challenges along the way. That is what the Palins are doing, and they should be commended once again for not just talking about their pro-life and pro-family values, but living them out even in the midst of trying circumstances.\n \n \"Being a Christian does not mean you're perfect. Nor does it mean your children are perfect. But it does mean there is forgiveness and restoration when we confess our imperfections to the Lord. I've been the beneficiary of that forgiveness and restoration in my own life countless times, as I'm sure the Palins have,\" Dobson said.\n \n Some evangelicals gathered in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, for the Republican convention speculated that the news would pose more of a problem for Democrats than for the GOP ticket.\n \n Speculation by some on blogs that Palin's son Trig was actually Bristol's child had led to outrage among conservatives.\n \n Any comment by Democrats that is viewed as remotely critical could make both Sarah and Bristol Palin appear to be sympathetic victims of a political vendetta.\n \n By Monday afternoon, evangelical leaders were circling the wagons.\n \n \"The media are already trying to spin this as evidence Gov. Palin is a 'hypocrite,' but all it really means is that she and her family are human,\" Dobson said. \"They are in my prayers and those of millions of Americans.\"\n \n Find this article at: \n http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/01/palin.evangelicals/index.html",

Regardless of how they are dodging their taxes. Regardless of the situation.\n \n But \"hate crimes\" are about providing a GREATER punishment for a GREATER crime, as judged by the GREATER impact upon society.\n \n Again, all this has been explained to you before, but you just ignore it... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nIt appears to me that only brain-dead PC people feel the need to have special categories of crimes, so I guess we&#8217;re even. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n At face value, that's another stupid statement.\n A VAST majority of REPUBLICANS support hate crimes. By almost a 2-to-1 margin.\n Public Favors Expansion of Hate Crime Law to Include Sexual Orientation\n So I guess, by your thought process, most Republicans are \"brain-dead\" as well... emoticon_xgood",
