   "so what do you think about this whole retirement thing? He's a good player and still had several years of playing in him IMO. He was one of the most dominant runners in today's league. I'm not sure I understand why he just up and quit....and I can't believe the position he left his team in...he could have at least done this earlier in the summer and not left them hanging like he did. \n \n what I want to know is this: are we going to find out \"the rest of the story\" as Paul Harvey would say? do you think there is more to this than we are hearing now? If so...any ideas as to what it might be? If it is drugs, that never stopped him before according to his comments.",

   "That sorry SOB left me in a lurch. emoticon_angry :xcensored \n \n Word is he was facing a 4 or 5 game suspension for his 3rd marijuana infraction.\n \n Combine that with his general weirdness, and you have a guy that just walks off the field after wind sprints, a week before training camp, with no warning, apparently not a single word, to any of his teammates or any Dolphins officials.\n \n I never thought he was a top 5 guy, but certainly top 10 given the right offense. \n \n I think shaving off that massive hair left him a little too light headed.\n \n Waxy",
