   "What I'm reading is that public sentiment against Poland's involvement in the Iraq coalition is growing, complete with their politicians stating they will remain firm in their commitment to keep Polish troops in Iraq despite domestic pressure to withdraw them. Sounds like a parallel to Spain's public opinion, so wouldn't that make Poland a prime target for Bin Laden or other Islamic extremists to gain popular support by attacking Poland?",

Whether it is somewhat loyalty to the US or their own realization of the fruits of struggle, the Pols are currently \"in for the long haul\".\n \n http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0421IraqPoland21-ON.html\n \n It appears also that the Pols are doing a good job. Their discovery of French rockets has proven once again why the French did not want us to invade Iraq...they were making lots of money selling them rockets that they denied providing.\n \n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/994679/posts\n \n And here's maybe another reason the French didn't want us to get to Baghdad.\n \n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/902743/posts\n \n There is only one possible stage below the Moral Sense; that is the Immoral Sense. The Frenchman has it. Man is but little lower than the angels. This definitely locates him. He is between the angels and the French. \n --Mark Twain",

Those attacks are basically recruitment features intended to build allegiance within the Muslim extremist community and point out to our bought and paid for coalition members that by siding with US/Israeli Policy those members have also bought a full share of whatever the extremists are capable of in the way of retaliation. I wonder how much US aid and trade loan guarantee per dead Spaniard it came out to? Poland is in for $66 million in 2005 US military aid, including C-130s, so they'll be a lot tougher to sway by just killing off a few regular citizens.",

   "Actually, I would say the terrorists attack any and all countries that exercise political policies that are contrary to their beliefs. The 9/11 attacks against the US illustrated that they are perfectly willing to confront the \"mightiest\" nation in the world. The countries that seem to avoid terrorism are the ones that \"mind their own business\". I know that statement will strike a nerve with many, but down deep, I think everyone knows it's true.",

   "I see two different areas of turmoil. One is the Israel/US/Coalition based on direct foreign intervention in Mideast affairs, the other in individual countries such as the Philippines, Thailand and former USSR States where Muslim populations seek government recognition and representation as an ethnic group. The former is supported by US money and materials to support special interest groups while individual conflicts seem to remain internal political issues. \n \n Those countries that mind their own business do seem untouched by the violence experienced by coalition members, but let's remember that all coalition members are virtually mercenaries recruited by the US using military aid, direct financial aid and trade loan guarantees. Under US criminal law, those involved would be defined as contract killers. I'd think Islamic extremists view it in a similar manner. \n \n Supporters of the coalition who rationalize coalition support as being motivated by political ideology in support of democracy need to question those motivations. Money talks and I find it difficult to imagine any coalition members in Iraq if they were paying for it out of their own pocket. $66 million plus all Iraq incurred expenses for Poland seems ironic when we're unable to fund many of our domestic programs without using debt.",
