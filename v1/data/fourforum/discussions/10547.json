The primaries have been moved to such early dates that the clock is really ticking for Dr. Paul.\n And considering the dirty tricks that have been pulled by the establishment, like secretly moving up the date when one can register as a Republican and vote in the primaries, it's going to be a struggle for Dr. No.\n \n Voting on the same electronic voting machines that gave GW the presidency twice is also a big problem.\n \n But let's just hope that miracles still happen.\n \n BTW I just received my bumpersticker in the mail. It's the same one that Dr. Paul has on his desk in DC: \n \n http://unalienablerights.us/gallery/albums/2008prez/ronpaulsdesk.jpg\n \n I also absolutely love this Ron Paul pic, it basically sums up everything that Ron Paul is about<b></b>:\n \n http://www.rense.com/1.imagesH/paulheart_dees.jpg",
