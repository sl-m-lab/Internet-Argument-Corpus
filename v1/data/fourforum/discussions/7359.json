I really don't see that Jesus's main contribution to humanity was the idea of challenging old dogma. I certainly don't see that the main thrust of his teachings was to question things. Rather, the most important message I've picked up from Jesus's teachings is that morality applies to everyone. In his day it was common to treat your friends one way, and your enemies another. Family was special, strangers could be enslaved. Jesus taught that everyone, no matter who they are, should be treated with the same high moral standard. This was a radical idea in his age, and a lesson that people are still struggling with today. That, to my eyes, was the main thing that Jesus tried to teach.",

I certainly don't see that the main thrust of his teachings was to question things.\n\n \n Not the overt message, to be sure; it wasn't my intention to imply as such and I apologise for the confusion. Nevertheless, what he did was take a long-established worldview and say 'Your books say god wants us to behave in such a way, but they are wrong for these reasons. It is better for everyone if we behave like this instead'. The lesson I take from that is that enlightenment and reason should be allowed to triumph over doctrine. Doctrine is not without value - after all, we don't avoid teaching current scientific theory just because it may be refined or overturned in future. But nor do we mummify scientific theory and close our minds to reason and insight.\n \n \nJesus taught that everyone, no matter who they are, should be treated with the same high moral standard.

It's aimed at improving people's lives and helping us live together. To me, that lesson doesn't require faith to appreciate; heck, it has nothing to do with god or an afterlife; it's all about making our time here on earth better for everybody.\n \n Which is why I think it's a shame that something pure and enlightened like 'treat everyone equally' has over the centuries been hijacked and twisted and loaded with caveats by people seeking to use the power of that idea to promote their own personal agendas and prejudices.",

The Pharasiees were trying to diminish the center role of the Temple, which put them in opposition to the Sadducees politically. It appears that some of the early christian concepts went even further, as well as some other groups. For example, the ministry of John the Baptist (who was not Chrisitan) was reaching out to the disenfranchiesed. \n \n I am not sure how much of this movement was new with the early Christians, and how much was already in place.

Are you asking if we should reevaluate God's Word against gay sex sin and employ the reasoning of the carnal mind? Please elaborate.\n\n \n Rarely do two short questions offer such scope for response.\n \n To begin with, the disingenuous nature of the first question. The comparison is not between two 'different kinds' of reasoning as you would like to imply. It is a comparison between being willing or unwilling to re-examine what we hold as true in the light of new evidence. One is reason, the other is refusal to reason. Dissemble however you will, that fact remains.\n \n To continue, the disingenuous nature of the second question. It is not our carnal impulses that have altered in the last 2000 years, it is our scientific understanding of how those impulses originate and how little control we have over their object. \n \n In the bible's heyday, homosexuality was thought to be a conscious choice to be deviant; including it in a checklist of sins made rational sense. They understood so little, in fact (correct me if I'm wrong) that they didn't even have a word for it. This is why the book does not describe gay people going to hell; only the physical act being sinful - which unfortunately gives christian bigots a kind of semi-PC way to express their prejudice: all they want gay people to do is have some willpower and deny their sinful carnal impulses.\n \n We know so much more now. Condemning people for a choice is one thing; choosing to believe that a loving god would create people incapable of enjoying the love of another human being without sinning is quite another. But you would rather believe that your god is mean than question a few words a man wrote in a book a couple of thousand years ago. You refuse to even entertain the notion that those scholars might have succumbed to a little human weakness and inserted some of the rules they personally believed to be important. That is your choice, and you make it happily because however christian you believe yourself to be, you have hatred and disgust in your heart for those different to yourself.

Make no mistake, the revulsion you feel at the idea is no greater than theirs.\n \n \nAnd would one be a bigot for mocking traditional Biblical beliefs?\n\n \n Possibly, if one were mocking them. I already stated that in the context of knowledge at the time, the passages prohibiting gay sex made sense. That is no longer the case.

It is not bigotry or \"meaness\" to try to turn someone from a sinful lifestyle to a Godly life.\n\n \n It would seem the failings of my elucidation are matched only by your comprehension. What a pair we make!\n \n I said that you choose to believe in a mean god; a cruel god who would for no conceivable purpose create a substantial fraction of humanity congenitally inclined towards sin. It hardly matters what particular hoops you want them to jump through to redeem themselves, be it having sex with a person they find repulsive or denying their need for human intimacy entirely. The fact remains you have chosen to believe your god both created them and cursed them from birth, and rejected a perfectly rational alternative explanation: that at least some of the bible's contents was scholarly and well-meaning but ultimately the work of imperfect Man. In making that choice you reject reason; you take the greatest talent your god allegedly gave you, and bury it.\n \n \nThat, sir, is love of the kind you have not tried to familiarize yourself with. I recommend you seek Christ / God and his Spirit so you can expand your limited horizons in this area. And I suppose anyone who disagrees with gay marriage is \"filled with hatred\" (sounds like a convenient talking point from the liberal left do denigrate anyone who disagrees with them).\n\n \n Odd that you would put \"filled with hatred\" in quotes. Who are you quoting?\n \n Here is the situation: you choose to believe you were born 'right' and others were born 'wrong'. I really don't know what you want me to call that, but you won't convince me to use a nice word.\n \n \nAs for the 'Biblical \"scholars supposedly succumbing to human weakness and inserting some personal rules they believed to be important,' what foundation do you have for this enormous leap? The Word of God has not been made obsolete by some personal viewpoint of yours\n\n \n Scientific discovery is not a personal viewpoint - though it's understandable that you, as someone who venerates opinion above all else, would assume that I must do the same.\n \n I recall reading in one of your other posts that chemical imbalance in the mother's womb might be responsible for homosexuality, and that this meant it was not a genetic condition. If true, this would only move the genetic responsibility back a generation, to the mother. One cannot create a baby of any kind from a single cell without the complex series of chemical processes supplied by the womb, which are in turn governed by the mother's genes and the process of her gestation, and so on. Over billions of years we have, in a sense, gradually blurred the division between one generation and the next, but ultimately we are derived from genetic information.\n \n \nand science cannot disprove God by any means,\n\n \n Stop me if you've heard this one. There's a china teapot out in space, orbiting the sun. Science can't disprove that either. \n \n It's easy to contrive all sorts of nonsense that science cannot disprove, and that's exactly what religion has done: devised a mythological being whose existence cannot be disproved by reason. There's nothing profound or clever about that accomplishment. Here, I'll do it again: in the centre of the earth there's a small aubergine from which all creation grew. All hail the Purple Skinned one, for truly He is our maker!\n \n It's ironic that what you see as god's greatest strength - that he cannot be rationally disproved - simultaneously cripples him with a devastating weakness: he cannot be proved, either. For me to dismiss your assertions that he exists I need do nothing more strenuous than say 'I disagree'. You are a person; I am a person. You have an opinion; I have an opinion. If the power of god is to be found in the difference, he is feeble indeed.\n \n \nso I'm afraid all your \"knowledge\" to the contrary is based in wishful thinking as opposed to anything that you can document.\n\n \n I'm disinclined to accept accusations of wishful thinking from someone who believes themselves to be the centre of creation :)\n \n Here's the thing about science, and I want you to really try and grasp the significance of it: the whole universe is its 'bible'. Read without prejudice, it tells us (amongst other things) that it is billions of years old, that mankind evolved within it, and that homo- and hetero-sexuals have no choice in the matter. Science textbooks are merely imperfect translations made by men and women doing their best to use reason to illuminate the truth that surrounds us. Nothing I can document? Science's 'holy book' is around seven million times older and at least four million billion billion billion billion billion times weightier than yours, which rather puts a dent in your pride at having finished reading yours first.\n \n Note the quotes around 'bible' and 'holy book'. I use the analogy not to imply that science is a religion or pursued with religious modes of thought, but in an attempt to convey to someone whose only acceptable point of reference is a book how fundamental observable reality is to science.\n \n \nSo, will you now go on record here and support gay sex relationships? That seems to be the underlying goal of your theme and postings in this thread.\n\n \n Is that meant to be some kind of challenge? Do you believe you have manouevred me into pigeonholing myself as someone with a gay sex 'agenda'?\n \n Let's have this whole discussion again, only we'll use the age of the universe as our bone of contention. Or evolution. I really don't mind - any subject on which your ancient text is at odds with what observation and reason demonstrate to us.\n \n I chose the issue of homosexuality because frankly I couldn't care less how old you think the universe is. It doesn't affect the lives of others.\n \n What I do care about is that you are not content with denying homosexuals entrance to an imaginary heaven, or your churches. You are maintaining a vindictive stranglehold on the institution of marriage - and more importantly its attendant secular rights. A gay man may be denied the right to visit his partner in hospital, if his partner's family so decrees. A gay man may be legally compelled to testify against his partner, something prohibited in the case of married couples. Here's another gem I just found: \n \n \nAs survivors, estranged families can, in nearly all states, even seize a real estate property that a gay couple may have been buying together for many years, quickly sell it at the largest possible loss, and stick the surviving partner with all the remaining mortgage obligations on a property that partner no longer owns, leaving him out on the street, penniless.\n\n \n This is not some whimsical adherence to outdated but harmless ideas. This is belief wielded in anger and malice, with the state standing passively by. It is despicable; I find it worthy of contempt and such eloquence as I can bring to bear to end it.",

   "Originally Posted by Easyrider \n We want them to come to Christ and be transformed by the Holy Spirit to enjoy their sexuality the way God intended it to be - between one man and one woman in marriage.\n \n \nInteresting. Do you think you could do the reverse, if required? Learn to 'enjoy' gay sex?\n\n \n Not via the Holy Spirit. It's not God's program. \n \n Originally Posted by Easyrider \n And would one be a bigot for mocking traditional Biblical beliefs?\n \n \n I already stated that in the context of knowledge at the time, the passages prohibiting gay sex made sense. That is no longer the case. \n\n \n No longer make sense to you, you mean. God remains God and his moral laws are still in force.\n \n \n I said that you choose to believe in a mean god; a cruel god who would for no conceivable purpose create a substantial fraction of humanity congenitally inclined towards sin.\n\n \n Your assumption is that God created people gay and then wants to punish them for being that way. That's a false assumption. The Scripture says that creation became subject to frustration, which many commentators view as an entropy of sorts, both physical and spiritual. So, instead of God being \"mean,\" he not only provided salvation to all mankind through his own atoning sacrifice, but also provides sanctification and divine help to reverse various personal issues such as homosexuality. \n \n \n \n The fact remains you have chosen to believe your god both created them and cursed them from birth, and rejected a perfectly rational alternative explanation: that at least some of the bible's contents was scholarly and well-meaning but ultimately the work of imperfect Man. In making that choice you reject reason; you take the greatest talent your god allegedly gave you, and bury it. \n\n \n See above. You also err in taking the divine revelation of God and making it into the work of imperfect man, based on nothing but unfounded conjecture. You deny the spiritual and focus only on the so-called \"rational\" (physical properties of man and the universe). So what you have left is your own subjective reasoning, as opposed to God's objective rationale. \n \n \n \n Here is the situation: you choose to believe you were born 'right' and others were born 'wrong'. I really don't know what you want me to call that, but you won't convince me to use a nice word. \n\n \n We were all born \"wrong\" in a way - in a sinful condition. As the Bible says, ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. All, then, gay and straight, need Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins.\n \n \n Scientific discovery is not a personal viewpoint - though it's understandable that you, as someone who venerates opinion above all else, would assume that I must do the same. \n\n \n Then please produce your scientific evidence that 'Biblical scholars / authors supposedly succumbed to human weakness and inserting their own (instead of God's) personal rules that they believed to be important? \n \n \n I recall reading in one of your other posts that chemical imbalance in the mother's womb might be responsible for homosexuality, and that this meant it was not a genetic condition. If true, this would only move the genetic responsibility back a generation, to the mother. One cannot create a baby of any kind from a single cell without the complex series of chemical processes supplied by the womb, which are in turn governed by the mother's genes and the process of her gestation, and so on. Over billions of years we have, in a sense, gradually blurred the division between one generation and the next, but ultimately we are derived from genetic information. \n\n \n Since there are presently no replicated scientific studies that confirm gayness is hereditary, and since it seems that you believe that some people are born gay, then if the cause of that \"gayness\" didn't occur in the mother's womb, how then, and when, does it occur (before birth)? If not in the mother's womb then where, if it's not hereditary? You're not left with many alternatives there. \n \n \n \n It's easy to contrive all sorts of nonsense that science cannot disprove, and that's exactly what religion has done: devised a mythological being whose existence cannot be disproved by reason. There's nothing profound or clever about that accomplishment. Here, I'll do it again: in the centre of the earth there's a small aubergine from which all creation grew. All hail the Purple Skinned one, for truly He is our maker!\n\n \n Please provide your evidence for the \"mythology\" of Christ's life, death, and resurrection? Fact is it is all documented by historical accounts and eyewitnesses, and much of it was foretold in advance. Your purple skinned one doesn't have that kind of historical documentation. \n \n Have you ever spent any quality time in in-depth study of the Bible, particularly the New Testament? It doesn't sound like you have. There have been a good many skeptics who have presented the same arguments as you and who determined in their lives to disprove Christ and Christianity but, who after intense research and review, have become believers instead. I don't think you have done your due diligence and invite you to do it now with an unbiased mind.\n \n \n I'm disinclined to accept accusations of wishful thinking from someone who believes themselves to be the centre of creation \n\n \n Strawman. I never claimed to be at the center of creation.\n \n \n Science textbooks are merely imperfect translations made by men and women doing their best to use reason to illuminate the truth that surrounds us. Science's 'holy book' is around seven million times older and at least four million billion billion billion billion billion times weightier than yours, which rather puts a dent in your pride at having finished reading yours first.\n\n \n Science is totally and woefully inadequate in explaining the spiritual / supernatural. Over 90% of Americans from all professions and educational backgrounds believe in a God of some fashion. Science will never be able to put God to rest as you seek to do. You might also want to acknowledge at some point that Christians or other men and women who believed in a Creator God founded most of the major scientific disciplines. \n \n \n \n What I do care about is that you are not content with denying homosexuals entrance to an imaginary heaven, or your churches.\n\n \n Both of these imagined suppositions are false. Where do you come up with these erroneous fabrications? I seek salvation for gays in a real (not imagined) heaven and also invite them to church anytime they want (the latter as long as they don't try to instill their own moral relativism into the mix). If they want to create their own moral framework apart from the Biblical God they can start their own religious institutions. As for gays visiting their civil-recognized partners in the hospital, I support that. Attorneys and the government can help with your other issues, like estate problems. I see no reason two gays who have bought property together should not be allowed to leave it to whoever they want. They worked for it and should be allowed to share in it legally or will it to whoever they want.",

As the Bible says, ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. All, then, gay and straight, need Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins.\n\n \n You are evading the issue. You choose to believe that god, by allowing the creation of gay people, wants some people to endure more hardship than others in order to make it to heaven. They must consort with members of the opposite sex in a manner they find repugnant, or live their lives without experiencing the joy of intimacy that god himself thinks is so precious it must be sanctified by marriage. I emphasise again: you voluntarily choose to believe this of your god rather than accept reasonable alternatives.\n \n \nThen please produce your scientific evidence that 'Biblical scholars / authors supposedly succumbed to human weakness and inserting their own (instead of God's) personal rules that they believed to be important?\n\n \n My pleasure.\n \n The normal state of affairs is that men and women write books, and express their personal opinions within them, correct? This is observable for millions upon millions of books. Your conjecture is that the bible, uniquely, was entirely authored by a god. Now, normally when one claims that a rule which has held true in millions of cases has a single exception, the burden of proof lies upon the proponent of the idea. Still, never mind. Let us continue.\n \n My contrary conjecture is that at least some of the bible was not.\n \n For my conjecture to be possibly true, I need to show that at least some of the bible could have been written without your god's intervention. To prove that my conjecture is definitely true, I further need to show that at least some of the bible could not have been written by the god you describe.\n \n First, the book's content. Many passages describe concepts well within the wit of humans to comprehend, and thus devise. There are plenty of books far fewer people understand that were unquestionably written by men and women. The possibility cannot be eliminated, therefore, that at least some biblical teachings were of mortal origin.\n \n One final test, to be absolutely sure: The book itself claims to be the work of god. The inherent truthfulness of this claim was scientifically tested, first by attempting to append the words 'This book is entirely the work of god' to a broad range of other publications, including Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Heat magazine, and The Dandy. No unexpected results were observed. Secondly, sections of Heat magazine's dietary and fashion advice were spliced into the bible in several locations, without noticably affecting its claim to still be the unadulterated word of god.\n \n The first part of my proof is complete, and the second part of your conjecture disproved. It is still possible that the bible is the undiluted word of god, but it is not certainly true. If you are prepared to agree with my reasoning and concede the point, I will continue. If you aren't - and you aren't, because if you did I would have \"The bible is not necessarily all god's word: EasyRider\" in my .sig - why waste everyone's time?\n \n \nthen if the cause of that \"gayness\" didn't occur in the mother's womb\n\n \n Actually it was you who said it did, here:\n \n \nThe last research I saw was that \"gayness\" (for lack of a better word) was caused (in part) by abnormal chemical imbalances in the mother's womb.\n\n \n I was merely explaining how that could still be the result of genetics. Even if the mother's genes didn't directly cause the chemical imbalance, they could still express a vulnerability to common environmental factors that result in a chemical imbalance. None of this makes homosexuality anyone's choice.\n \n The case for a genetic cause of homosexuality is considerably strengthened by the observation of homosexual behaviour - up to and including life partnership, sex, and the aggressive rejection of females in heat - in 450 of 1500 non-human species studied. Unless of course it was peer pressure and social upbringing.\n \n \nPlease provide your evidence for the \"mythology\" of Christ's life, death, and resurrection?\n\n \n Jesus was a man. The myth is god.\n \n \nThere have been a good many skeptics who have presented the same arguments as you and who determined in their lives to disprove Christ and Christianity but, who after intense research and review, have become believers instead.\n\n \n And how many didn't?\n \n I don't dispute that there is some very worthy instruction to be found in your book. I only point out that such instruction as is worthy can be framed and argued convincingly without invoking divine authority, and that such instruction as cannot be reasoned logically should be viewed with a critical eye.\n \n \nStrawman. I never claimed to be at the center of creation.\n\n \n Clutching at straws. Your faith puts mankind at the centre of creation.\n \n \nScience is totally and woefully inadequate in explaining the spiritual / supernatural. \n\n \n On the other hand it's absolutely fantastic at debunking it.\n \n Of course science can't explain the supernatural; think about the word's construction: super... natural... It is the class of things devised so as not to admit a rational explanation.\n \n You're so unreasonably proud that language can frame supernatural concepts, as if the ability to postulate something outside logic is somehow 'better' than being able to construct a reasoned argument. I really don't understand why. It's as if we're playing chess, and you declare there's an invisible magical wall around all your pieces that prevents me taking them. Does it make you a better player than me, just because if we adhere to your rules you'll win every time? Is your version of the game superior?\n \n (If you want to see what happens when both players insist their pieces have magical invisible shields and the other side's don't, check out CNN more or less any day of the week. They'll be the stories tagged '50 die in...').\n \n To me the most amazing and intriguing quality the universe possesses is its consistency and apparent adherence to logical rules. What justification have you for saying that magical, unprovable and undisprovable concepts are superior? We could just as easily call them 'subnatural'. In fact, I think I will do, henceforth.\n \n \nOver 90% of Americans from all professions and educational backgrounds believe in a God of some fashion. Science will never be able to put God to rest as you seek to do.\n\n \n Science has already put most myths to rest and stripped those that remain of their powers, one by one. Most religions that there have ever been are dead. Astrophysics and geophysics long since debunked the creation myth. Evolution is in the process of tearing down the garden of eden. The universe will always be there, waiting for honest men and women to choose to see it, and I am confident it will outlive the last reprint of your book.\n \n \nYou might also want to acknowledge at some point that Christians or other men and women who believed in a Creator God founded most of the major scientific disciplines.\n\n \n I never said religion made you stupid :) Besides, almost all people historically have been religious; it would be a startling statistical blip if none of them managed to do anything useful. Science has only really had a few hundred years to undo the superstitions of the last hundred thousand; give it time.\n \n \nI seek salvation for gays in a real (not imagined) heaven\n\n \n Correction: you believe it to be real in the absence of evidence. This is also known as imaginary.\n \n \nAs for gays visiting their civil-recognized partners in the hospital, I support that.

However, the situations I describe happen nonetheless, and they happen because people are taught - against all reason - that homosexuality is a sin.",

That doesn't mean evil is God's preferred plan for people. You can't create moral free agents and not allow them to go down the paths they decide to take, but God does hold people accountable in the end for their choices. And though some people have hardships others don't have (such as the man born blind so that the Glory of God could be revealed to others when Jesus healed him) God also provides his own divine help in the person of the Holy Spirit to help them through their hardships and set them on the right course (assuming they cooperate).

Were spiritually-discerning Biblically-based men of God allowed to present their findings? FYI, the Bible is spiritually-discerned, according to 1 Cor. 2:14.

   "To Peeling:\n \n THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\n \n Circa 750 B.C.\n \n According to Amos 1:1, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (767-739 B.C.), and Jeroboam, king of Israel (782-753 B.C.). The name \"Amos\" is derived from the Hebrew term meaning, \"lift a burden,\" or \"burden-bearer\" (note Isaiah 9:4, speaking of the coming Messiah as one who would carry our burdens, and also Matthew 11:28). His calling by God was to foretell of pending judgments upon a number of surrounding nations, and particularly of a coming judgment upon Israel. As is common with other Biblical prophets, along with the promise of impending judgment, God also gave Amos a glimpse of events that would soon occur in the life of the coming Messiah, though the significance of what was prophesied may or may not have been made known to Amos. And so it is in the Old Testament book of Amos that we find a prophecy that for many centuries was looked upon with wonder and curiosity:\n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that the prophecy of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death. This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man, and as such it dispels the theory that Christ could have manipulated events so as to make it appear that He was the Messiah. But is there any evidence that this really occurred? Did the sun go dark at noonday? In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more than just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Finally, the 2nd century Roman born jurist and theologian Tertullian referred to a Roman archives report of an \"unexplained darkness that took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, as can be seen in the archives of Pontius Pilate.\"\n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun. Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From God's perspective, it surely was a time of mourning for His only begotten son. \n \n Jesus once said, \"I am the light of the world.\" So it shouldn't be surprising that during his death there might be a time of darkness over the land. \n \n REFERENCE: McDowell, Josh. Evidence That Demands A Verdict (Vol. 1). Thomas Nelson Publishers. Nashville. 1972. (end)\n \n So there you have it. The prophecy, the Biblical fulfillment, and extra-Biblical confirmation. Should be easy for you to \"debunk,\" if the Bible is a myth, n'est pas?",

Confirmation of what you choose to believe was all I wanted to hear.\n \n \nThere are plenty of websites (some much more well thought out than others) that offer many evidences of the divine hand of God in the formation of the Bible.\n\n \n Not relevant; that stage of my proof was not intended to entirely eliminate god from the bible. See below.\n \n \nThis assumes God is incapable of relating to the average person. I don't see the merits of your argument so far, or else I am not understanding your rationale there.\n\n \n It's the latter. Read it again:\n \n \nFirst, the book's content. Many passages describe concepts well within the wit of humans to comprehend, and thus devise. There are plenty of books far fewer people understand that were unquestionably written by men and women. The possibility cannot be eliminated, therefore, that at least some biblical teachings were of mortal origin.\n\n \n I was not at that point attempting to prove that portions of the bible were definitely authored by men. I was demonstrating that the possibility exists.\n \n Now, for it to be worth me proving the stronger hypothesis (that god did not write some parts of the bible), which will be a good deal lengthier, I need to know if you're willing to concede the logic applied so far.\n \n \nAnd these \"findings\" were determined by WHOM?\n\n \n Sorry; I was only trying to inject a little levity into the proceedings. I didn't actually write 'this book is the work of god' in Heat magazine. Let it pass.\n \n \nGod's moral guidelines are directed towards behavior rather than inclinations.\n \n \n Strictly speaking: the moral guidelines written down in the bible, which you choose to believe are all the unadulterated word of god. You keep stating these things as facts and missing out the part where you acknowledge it's only your belief.\n \n \nLove of God and one's fellow man is at the center of Biblical teachings.\n\n \n And at the centre of a doughnut is a hole. Or possibly jam, if it's one of those heretical solid doughnuts. Burn them! But we weren't talking about doughnuts, or biblical teachings; we were talking about the centre of creation. According to your faith creation exists for our benefit. Without us, it would have no purpose. We are the centre of creation. I characterise that as wishful thinking.\n \n \nAccording to you and yours. There's a ton of people (and many of them scientists) who are at great odds with your statement.\n \n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/steve/\n \n Generously assuming that the whole ton consists of creation 'scientists', and they are all fairly spindly, that equates to roughly twenty of them. Yes, that sounds about about right.\n \n \nFYI, you just unwittingly concluded that God is logical, as evidenced by the \"intriguing quality the universe possesses in its consistency and apparent adherence to logical rules.\" That's the universe God created.\n \n \n Woah, there; your logical horses got all ahead of themselves.\n \n If you take what I said, which is that the universe is intriguingly logical, and bolt on what you think, which is that god created it, then yes, you do witlessly conclude that god is logical.\n \n However, you do not believe in a logical universe. You believe in a universe where blind poor people are placed ahead of me - by what I can only assume is a celestial ADD-sufferer - to test my generosity. It does not follow that the creator of such a universe is himself logical - much less 'a logical conclusion' which is what you were trying to pin on me :) Tut, tut.\n \n \nHomosexual (sexual) behavior is a sin. And according to the historical and moral accounts of the Bible, there's nothing unreasonable about it.\n \n \n If it is a reasonable prohibition, enlighten me as to its rational basis. Explain how gay people in a stable loving relationship having sex harms anyone. Remember: them ending up in hell doesn't count; that's the punishment you insist they deserve, not the reason for the rule. 'Against god's plan' doesn't count either; that just makes it god's stupid and irrational rule instead of yours, which doesn't paint him in a very good light in my eyes. \n \n \nHave you ever read the entire Bible? Actually studied it?\n\n \n Nope. Talking to people who have kind of puts me off :)\n \n (I'm not being flippant. If I was, I'd have said I prefer non-fiction)",

It's there. God just help finish the job when it was evident Pharaoh's heart was a stubborn as an atheist. \n \n \n \n Matthew 2:1-22 and compare to Luke 1:26-2:41\n How many differences you can find?

According to Matthew and Mark they both did: but according to Luke, only one did - the other actually had a nice little friendly chat with Jesus, acknowledging his divinity. Contradiction.\n\n \n Nonsense. A logical explanation is that first they both mocked Jesus and then one had a change of heart while he was suffering and then believed on Jesus. Again, you grasp at straws to create a problem that isn't one.\n \n \n For Jesus' resurrection, who exactly went to the tomb, when and where did the angel appear, was the stone or was the stone not already rolled away when the women got there, were there guards and did they become as dead men, and so on.\n\n \n Another exercise in superficial reading. See the responses for yourself in the following links, which refute your knee-jerk \"contradiction\":\n \n Harmony of the Resurrection \n \n http://www.new-life.net/resurrct.htm\n \n Harmony of the Resurrection \n \n http://answeringislam.org/Andy/Resurrection/harmony.html\n \n Harmony of the Resurrection \n \n http://thebereans.net/arm-resurr2.shtml\n \n DamEtel, you're 0-4 on these.

   "What can I say except this is God's universe and he gets to make the rules.\n\n \n Thank you. Nice to see you're willing to continue the discussion.\n \n \nWhat I'm interested in is on what basis do you posit this? An anti-supernatural bias, perhaps? I don't see any other rationale you can go with outside of that.\n\n \n My fundamental basis for argument is that millions of books are demonstrably written by men and women. To assume the same holds true for another book, unless proved otherwise, is not bias. I am not the one claiming a unique exception.\n \n \nI can say the same thing about your argument above. You can't possibly refute the proposition that God divinely inspired the Bible (at least you've provided no credible, historical argument yet), so what's the point of me spending time on that?\n\n \n A very good question, with a very good answer.\n \n Proven statements are definitely true or definitely false. Unproven statements are neither; it is only possible to have an opinion as to their veracity. Are we together thus far?\n \n Are all unproven statements equal? Logically yes, but in practice no. You may be aware of Fermat's Last Theorem: for a long time nobody could prove or disprove it - yet so consistently did it seem to apply that hundreds of years of mathematical theory were piled atop it. We would have had an awful lot of rethinking to do had it turned out to be false.\n \n By contrast, the notion that there is a china teapot floating in space, or an aubergine at the centre of the planet are frivolous examples of unprovable assertions. I only employ them to highlight the gulf of logical limbo that exists between false and true. Are we still in agreement?\n \n I would not expect you to waste your time upon teapots in space or purple, planet-spawning fruit. But let's examine our conflicting proposals to determine whether either deserves to be dismissed so lightly.\n \n Your claim is that the bible is 100% cover-to-cover word of god. Correct?\n My counter-claim is not that some of it was definitely not written by god, but rather that your assertion is a) unproven and b) admits reasonable doubt.\n \n Rationale: \n \n Whatever prophecy you claim is contained in its pages, the bible is not 100% cover-to-cover prophecy. There are many, many pages of historical detail and moral teachings which men would be perfectly capable of producing or devising unaided. \n \n Proof: You yourself use historical details independently verified in secular records to support the bible's veracity - these independent sources were by definition created by men unaided. The bible, therefore, demonstrably does contain information that secular scholars were capable of recording by themselves. If you contest this fact, you invalidate all independent historical evidence for the bible's truthfulness.\n \n Look at it another way: if you were to go through the bible and remove all the prophecy you claim as evidence of divine origin, the resulting book would still contain hundreds of pages. By your own definition, based on what you removed, those remaining pages contain no evidence that they were written by god.\n \n So here we have considerable quantities of text for which there is no direct evidence of divine inspiration, some of which - including historical details and moral philosophy - have been found independently in the work of secular scholars.\n \n Is this proof god didn't write the whole bible? No - but that was not my proposition.\n \n Is it proof that some of the bible could easily have been written by men? Absolutely, and thus my proposition is proven. That is the only point I want you to concede: not the certainty that men contributed ideas to the bible, but that it is possible.",

There&#8217;s too much of it to casually dismiss, I think.\n \n \n What might an uninspired Bible look like, especially one which originated in the ANE, the work of a considerable number of authors? Well, it would probably contain duplication, contradiction, errors of science and fact believed by the authors to be true, mythlogy, and folklore. It would no doubt contain failed prophecies, descriptions of various magic acts and supernatural interventions, and would probably attribute certain diseases (epilepsy?) to demonic possession. The god of this Bible would almost certainly be both anthropomorphic and tribal, capable of anger, remorse, and jealousy. He would be expected to come down from heaven from time to time so as to check out things on earth, and he could be convinced to change his mind. This Bible might even predict the imminent 'end of all things' coincident with the return to earth of a god-man floating down from the sky. Such a Bible would certainly not be timeless. Instead, it would be expected to contain regulations, prohibitions, beliefs, prophecies, and practices which later generations would find illogical and absurd. \n \n A great many authoritative Bible scholars are of the opinion that Paul and the authors of the Gospels were not eyewitnesses to Jesus' ministry but, instead, made use of second or third-hand sources, adding embellishments as they went along. And, thus, the story appears to have grown in the telling - one can detect in Paul and the Gospel authors a gradual evolution of Christology.\n \n Why did they write what they did? Who knows? What motivates some people to believe/profess what they do? But the inability to fully answer that question does not prevent authoritative scholars from examining the Bible (and other so-called sacred texts) with a critical eye (by 'critical', I mean 'investigative'). The (late) eminent Roman Catholic scholar Ray Brown has something to say about that below. Viewing the Bible as an ancient religious text, written by men who were attempting to define a relationship with a divine being, frees one from the burden of attempting to defend the Bible as the 'Word of God'. \n \n I remind you of the following observation which I've given you previously...\n \n The reader must understand that the Torah contains a great variety of material: laws, narratives, history, folk tales, songs, proverbial sayings, poetry, and, in the early parts of Genesis, myths and legends. Contemporary readers are often put off because they have been exposed to a method of biblical interpretation which understands the text in a literal way. Thus, if Genesis says that God created woman out of the rib of man, or tells of a serpent speaking, or of ancient man living several hundred years, the literalist interprets the story to mean precisely what the words convey. The contemporary reader familiar with the history and nature of the text will have to remember that a literal understanding of the Torah may lead to grave misconceptions. -- The Torah, A Modern Commentary, Union of American Hebrew Congregations Pub., New York\n \n Also...\n \n From the viewpoint of culture and context, the authors (of the NT) and their audiences had a worldview very different from ours: different background, different knowledge, different suppositions about reality. We cannot hope to open a NT book and read it responsibly with the same ease as we read a book written in our own culture and worldview. Consequently, an intelligent effort to understand the background and outlook of the NT authors can be of great assistance. - An Introduction To The New Testament, Raymond E.

   "I think you need to posit a credible theory about not only why so many individuals attested to the Biblical Jesus, but also I'd ask that you come up with a compelling / reasonable motive that explains why they all did it?\nThere seems little distinction between 'why so many attested' and 'why they all did it?' The distinction is even less, if by 'biblical Jesus' you mean to constrain your view only to the Jesus personality presented in the Bible. Outside the Bible there are very few historical references to Jesus. The only one that readily comes to mind is in Antiquities of the Jews, the Josephus passage that is likely an interpolation by a later Christian scribe.\n \n As a consequence, we are left to consider only the biblical accounting, uncorroborated by any contemporary source from 1st century Palestine. Turning to the evangelists who wrote the Four Gospels, we cannot suppose that their purpose was the same as modern historians. You could go to a library in the ancient world and find histories, letters, prose fiction, epic verse, drama, philosophical dialogues, and so on. But you could not find any other Gospel, which in Greek means 'Good News.'\n \n And what, you ask, was their motive? They wrote, as the Fourth Gospel says, \"that ye may believe.\"\n \n There's no reason to think that the writers concocted deceptive stories, such as the virgin birth or the resurrection. Nor is there reason to doubt that the NT is the work of men striving to be good. Still, the human capacity to fantasize is nearly without limit, especially in the realm of religious experience.

   "Originally Posted by Easyrider \n Jesus a heretic? Where do you get that from??\n \n \nThe fact he was crucified as punishment.\n\n \n By that standard many of the righteous prophets of the Old Testament were \"heretics\" too, because the established religious authorities persecuted or killed them. Several cases in point follow:\n \n 1 Kings 19:10 - So he (Elijah) said, 'I have been very zealous for the Lord God of Hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek to take my life.' \n \n Jeremiah 25:4 And though the LORD has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again, you have not listened or paid any attention.\n \n Numbers 14:10 But the whole assembly talked about stoning them (Moses and Aaron). Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the Tent of Meeting to all the Israelites. 11 The LORD said to Moses, \"How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the miraculous signs I have performed among them?\n \n Now why would one expect people of this mindset to receive Jesus as their Messiah when they persecuted or killed the prophets who foretold his coming? \n \n So your contention that Jesus was a heretic not only ignores the many specific examples that Jesus gave that exposed the real heretics - the pharisees - it only shows to me that Jesus wasn't killed for being a true heretic, but that Jesus, the so called heretic, was himself the victim of heretics. That much is documented by the examples in Scripture. \n \n \n So you agree that it is a matter of personal opinion whether the NT is entirely the word of god?\n\n \n Obviously. But IMO the dissent is not based on credible assumptions and the historical record. They're welcome to their beliefs, though.\n \n \n But you have to remember that the NT is a collection of works assembled some considerable time after they were penned, and would have been selected for inclusion based upon their adherence to Jesus as lord, as well as their palatability to the compiler. We will never know if there was a pro-gay gospel, because it wouldn't have made the cut.\n\n \n And we'll never know how many non-biblical confirmations of Jesus were discarded because secular or non-Biblical individuals might have trashed them for ideological reasons. I think the point should also be made that the entirety of the New Testament works weren't \"Biblical\" at the time. They were extra-Biblical accounts (some by skeptics who later changed their minds based on the evidence or their experiences) produced to document what really occurred. \n \n I also have a long list of Biblical scholars (some liberal), all of whom date the New Testament within the possible lifetimes of the individuals who wrote the works (before 95 AD), if you'd like to see it.\n \n \nBesides, stories inevitably change in the retelling, even by one person. The anecdote your grandfather tells you about the one that got away is not the same anecdote he told his friends the day after it happened. It will have been refined and embellished - and yet he will now genuinely believe that's what happened. It beggars belief that the same could not have occurred with the stories of Jesus's life.\n\n \n Well, based on extra-Biblical quotations, I've heard it estimated that 98% of the New Testament can be reproduced from other non-biblical sources. And again, the redundancy and repetitiveness of the central message of Christ's resurrection would make it difficult to believe that casual errors would have, time and time again, produced a revisionist interpretation on this.\n \n Also, using the same standard you just implied, I think you will need to throw all collegiate and other history books about 1st century and earlier personalities in the trash because we didn't get the real story. Do you wish to do that too? Or shall we just have one standard for all? \n \n [QUOTE=Peeling} The mere process of compiling the works into a single book could have ironed out many discrepancies. The inconsistencies we see today are just the ones they missed.[/QUOTE]\n \n Can you provide one specific example for one of these \"discrepancies or inconsistencies\" from the New Testament? Just one for now will be fine. Pick your best one.\n \n \nOh, I wouldn't dream of casually dismissing Jesus. Clearly something happened way back when. But the stories that surround him, the ones of which I am aware, at least, ring more true as the over-enthusiastic embellishments of people - rather like yourself - who want, need, or just prefer things to be 'spiritual' or 'supernatural', whether to convince others, or because they just can't believe an extraordinary human could be that inspirational. And the compilation of so many works into a single volume - a single volume with a predetermined purpose beyond the mere co-location of words - casts doubt, in my mind, on their independence.\n\n \n It looks like you're conclusion above is based on an opinion, rather than credible evidence that the Gospel writers, etc., \"embellished\" the accounts. There's simply no evidence to back that theory up. I think one should stick with the evidence until facts to the contrary are submitted. One could also say that the heretical opinions of some non-believers are the over-enthusiastic embellishments of people - rather like yourself - who want, need, or just prefer things to be non-spiritual' or non-supernatural, whether to convince others, or because they just can't believe that the historical Biblical accounts are genuine. It works both ways. \n \n We see the same truths that the Gospel writers presented in pretty much every generation from the time of Christ, as evidenced in the earliest church father's writings onward. If the accounts had been embellished, etc., I think we would see a gradual change in the main message from even the believers. And although there were \"skeptics\" and enemies of the Biblical message that are different than the Gospel accounts, that's normal in human nature. But there's a steady stream of Biblically based confirmations of the NT starting with the first generation after Christ and continuing forward in time. \n \n Lastly, the motive you gave for the NT writers was \"so that others could believe\" (paraphrasing).

   "By that standard many of the righteous prophets of the Old Testament were \"heretics\" too, because the established religious authorities persecuted or killed them.\n\n \n Religious authorities seem to have a real knack for that kind of thing. Probably worth another thread :)\n \n \nNow why would one expect people of this mindset\n\n \n Don't be so quick to judge; it's your mindset too. You may not share their exact views, and you may not be willing to go to such extremes to protect them, but the mode of thought is the same. You say they ignored prophecies - I say you ignore scientific evidence.\n \n \nObviously. But IMO the dissent is not based on credible assumptions and the historical record. They're welcome to their beliefs, though.\n\n \n To me, the incredible assumption is that the stories in the NT survived on average almost a half-century in the minds and conversations of the impressionable, superstitious, scientifically primitive culture across which this radical and exciting new religion was spreading, without deviating, in the slightest detail, from factual truth before they were committed to paper, and that - in their compilation into a single book - not a word was changed to make the whole more impressive or believable. Today we can and do record anything and everything in tremendous fidelity - upon the instant it happens - and many people still believe a plane flew into the Pentagon on 9/11.\n \n Can you even imagine what the feat you describe would require? On not one occasion, when discussing the events of Jesus's life, did anyone peripheral to events - perhaps seeking to bask a little closer to this novel flame of belief - assert a slightly exaggerated or embellished detail of something they 'witnessed'. On not one occasion did eloquence fail them and lead to a misunderstanding. On not one occasion was the narration of events involving many people influenced by what some of them only thought they experienced. Did all five thousand testify to being fed? \n \n I have to say, at this point, that particular story bugged me even as a child. Jesus takes the loaves and hands them out, and his disciples do the same, and everyone is magically fed, with baskets filled with leavings afterwards. A miracle. I can cope with walking on water, but you know why I never could believe the FTFT story? Not because of the implausibility of the events themselves - after all, it's a miracle; anything goes. No, it's the way the story is told, and what isn't said. \n \n For a start, this staggering event is rushed over in a throwaway handful of lines, as if by telling the story really quickly you can get it embedded in the faith centres of the brain without triggering the frontal lobes. That's fishy enough in itself.\n \n Second, and far more important, the disciples weren't amazed that they all had armfuls of bread after Jesus finished passing it out to them. None of them had anything pithy to say. Maybe they weren't the sharpest tools in the box, but after feeding the first fifty or so, weren't these men even a little curious as to where all the bread was coming from? Not its source, but the manner of its appearance - not even recorded! Did none of them think to mention bread popping into their hands? Did not one of them exclaim over the fact; something along the lines of 'Jesus, this is a lot of bread!' Did none of the five thousand notice this miracle - which must surely have endured for upwards of an hour - and cluster around to watch the bread appearing? We're told the exact number and composition of the loaves and who brought them, yet nothing at all worthy of note occurred between Jesus starting to hand the bread out and all five thousand finishing eating.\n \n I can't believe in that miracle, not because the event is logically impossible, but because the way it is described flies in the face of what you and I know would happen if food started multiplying out of nowhere. I'm expected to believe that these adult human beings spent an afternoon in front of five thousand other human beings, handing out food - never having to go back for more - and it was only remarked upon as unusual when they had all finished eating and filled the leftover baskets?\n \n Do you appreciate the point? It's a classic fairytale structure. Spurious details - number and type of loaf - are front-loaded, to make it sound like the person relating the story was actually there. Not four loaves, not six, but five. Not one fish, or three, but two. Wow, this is the testimony of a witness! And Jesus's actual words - this guy must have been right there! But the actual process of the miracle itself is entirely glossed over. \n \n Sorry for the brief post - very late here. I'll finish up tomorrow.",

   "How so? What scientific principle discounts predictive prophecy?\n\n \n The Uncertainty Principle.\n \n Besides, you can't have prophecy and free will. Without prophecy, the bible is just a book. Without free will, our existence and subsequent blessing or damnation is a charade.\n \n \nAgain, you seek to discount the spiritual by resorting to the scientific.\n\n \n I don't follow. The only 'science' I'm applying is to observe how all stories change; how all stories become imprinted with the bias of those doing the telling, and to make the reasonable assumption that biblical stories are no exception.\n \n \nAlso, your assumption is that none of the followers of Christ, or the people they told their accounts to, could possibly live another 50 years.\n\n \n I think maybe I wasn't clear enough; I wasn't assuming that at all. I'm simply saying that a second-hand dramatisation of what someone (or possibly several someones, all chipping in anecdotes and saying 'oh yes, I was there too, right next to Jesus; it was amazing') managed to describe thinking they witnessed, fifty years later, is not particularly convincing - especially when the dramatisation is not intended as an impartial account of events but as a tool to glorify Jesus.\n \n \nDid any one of them ever attest to it not happening?\n\n \n Would their words have been included in the bible if they did? Plenty of people denied that Jesus was the son of god during his life; they aren't exactly given equal column inches to explain their reasoning. \n \n \nWhen Jesus walked on the water and calmed the storm and the disciples were astonished, is that more believable to you, or are miracles just cast aside for whatever reason?\n\n \n Walking on water and calming a storm are physically impossible. But if we're allowing miracles, the merely physically impossible is no obstacle. Jesus is, after all, supposed to be the son of god in these tales. The specific problem I have with the feeding of the five thousand is not the act, which in itself is neither more nor less believable than walking on water. It is the utterly unrealistic behaviour of the disciples and ordinary Joe Public supposedly witnessing it.\n \n That story would have me believe that the disciples just walked around and fed five thousand people without anyone apart from Jesus saying or doing anything worth recording. They didn't feed fifty, notice they still had just as much bread as before, and watch more closely to see how the bread was replenishing itself. Not one of the five thousand decided to test this miracle by taking all the bread a disciple was carrying. Not one of them decided to fill every available container, item of clothing, and orifice with food and take it back for his family. Indeed, not one of them seemed to even notice what was going on. All five thousand were fed entirely without incident. Here was a miracle, happening right before their eyes, and they just passively allowed it to go on, and on, and on, and only afterwards decide to be impressed.\n \n The words 'pull the other one' are making a strong bid for freedom at this point. Play with logic and invent undisprovable subnatural beings if you must, but don't contradict human nature. Whatever Jesus managed to do with the bread, there is absolutely no way his audience failed to react or influence events. FTFT was, in whole or in part, exaggerated, distorted, or just plain made up.",

   "I'm returning to the earlier post I did not finish responding to. I hope this doesn't get too muddled :)\n \n \nAnd we'll never know how many non-biblical confirmations of Jesus were discarded because secular or non-Biblical individuals might have trashed them for ideological reasons.\n\n \n Quite true. I would still maintain that the internal consistency of biblical deference to Jesus as the messiah is essentially devoid of significance, given that it was not compiled as an objective history book by dispassionate scholars.\n \n \nAlso, using the same standard you just implied, I think you will need to throw all collegiate and other history books about 1st century and earlier personalities in the trash because we didn't get the real story. Do you wish to do that too? Or shall we just have one standard for all?\n\n \n Yes, let's. Let's require the bible to qualify its statements, list its references, name the sources of its information and provide an objective assessment of their reputability. Let's require it to explicitly distinguish hearsay, rumour and outright myth from verifiable facts. Let's require it to acknowledge contrary interpretations of events and deal with them in a fact-based, rather than rhetorical fashion.\n \n \nIt looks like you're conclusion above is based on an opinion, rather than credible evidence that the Gospel writers, etc., \"embellished\" the accounts. There's simply no evidence to back that theory up.\n\n \n There's no evidence they didn't, and plenty of examples of how a pre-existing agenda inevitably leads to biased reporting of events. The bible was written by believers for believers, to create believers. To think it rational to assume such a work will be undiluted, objective fact is an astounding feat of self-deception.\n \n \nrather like yourself - who want, need, or just prefer things to be non-spiritual' or non-supernatural, whether to convince others, or because they just can't believe that the historical Biblical accounts are genuine. It works both ways.\n\n \n You can write the words the other way around, but it certainly doesn't work both ways. Perhaps a couple of thousand years ago, yes, but no longer. Reason - having done a considerably better job of improving the human condition (a few hundred years of science has fed the five billion as well as enabling our online debate, while religion continues to bang on about gays, kill people over who gets to pray where, and struggle to retain its primitive power-stranglehold over sexuality) has become the default, and superstition the last resort.\n \n \nLastly, the motive you gave for the NT writers was \"so that others could believe\" (paraphrasing). That's a good motive for the New Testament being true,\n\n \n Since when has truth ever been served by narrators with a biased agenda?",

   " The specific problem I have with the feeding of the five thousand is not the act, which in itself is neither more nor less believable than walking on water. It is the utterly unrealistic behaviour of the disciples and ordinary Joe Public supposedly witnessing it.\n\n \n Well, Jesus had already healed the sick and cast out demons (Matthew 4:23-25), calmed the storm, and done a number of other miracles, so I suppose they were getting \"used\" to that sort of thing. \n \n \n \n Play with logic and invent undisprovable subnatural beings if you must, but don't contradict human nature. Whatever Jesus managed to do with the bread, there is absolutely no way his audience failed to react or influence events. FTFT was, in whole or in part, exaggerated, distorted, or just plain made up.\n\n \n Again, that's your unsubstantiated opinion. The historical accounts testify about what occurred. But if you want some real human nature from the disciples, just remember they all bailed out like cowards when Jesus was arrested, and they didn't change into fearless men of God until they saw the resurrected Christ. Human nature suggests something very powerful occurred to change their lives at that point. \n \n \n \nLet's require the bible to qualify its statements, list its references, name the sources of its information and provide an objective assessment of their reputability. Let's require it to explicitly distinguish hearsay, rumour and outright myth from verifiable facts. Let's require it to acknowledge contrary interpretations of events and deal with them in a fact-based, rather than rhetorical fashion.\n\n \n Let's review some eyewitness testimonies, etc., which are probably more numerous than what you have from a lot of other people and events from non-Biblical antiquity:\n \n Eyewitness Accounts and Investigative Testimony\n \n Luke 24:30 - When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. 31 Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. 32 They asked each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\" \n 33 They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 34 and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\" 35 Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. \n \n Luke 24:36 - While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\" 37 They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. 38 He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? 39 Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" \n \n John 20:16 - Jesus said to her, \"Mary.\" She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, \"Rabboni!\" (which means Teacher). 17 Jesus said, \"Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' \" 18 Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: \"I have seen the Lord!\" And she told them that he had said these things to her. \n \n John 20:19 - On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" 20 After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. \n \n John 20:26 - A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" 27 Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\" \n 28 Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\" \n \n 1 Corinthians 15:3 - For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. 6 After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, 8 and last of all he appeared to me also... \n \n Acts 1:1 - In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach 2 until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. 3 After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. 4 On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. \n \n 1 John 4:14 - And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. \n \n 2 Peter 1:16 - We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\n \n Luke 1:1 - Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3 Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. \n \n [QUOTE=Easyrider] Lastly, the motive you gave for the NT writers was \"so that others could believe\" (paraphrasing). That's a good motive for the New Testament being true. But what I'm asking you is what motive would there be for them if the accounts of Jesus were not true?\n \n \nSince when has truth ever been served by narrators with a biased agenda?\n\n \n Where's your evidence they were biased? Can they just be telling the truth about what occurred without being labeled as being biased? How would a companion of Jesus tell these accounts then to satisfy your criteria?",

Coins that were minted by Governor Varius Gratus (A.D. 16) showed that these tombs were used for burial of Christians before A.D. 70. The name of Jesus was found on ossuaries of priests found in the catacomb, indicating they were probably followers of Jesus. Many of the ossuaries included other names, such as Jarius, Jonathan, Joseph, Judah, Matthias, Menahem, Salome, Simon, and Zechariah. \n \n The name of Jesus was found on ossuaries of priests found in the catacomb, indicating they were probably followers of Jesus.

What they documented was the miracle itself. And not just this miracle, but numerous other ones, including Christ's resurrection. Just because they didn't conform to your personal criteria of providing a blow by blow description hardly disqualifies what they did verify. There's hundreds of millions of people around the planet who don't have a problem with this.\n \n \n You're trying once again to focus the debate on the resurrection, and it isn't going to work.

Again, if you want to discredit Christianity, you have to go after the resurrection. Why did all these people attest to it? Mass hysteria? Not likely, even from a psychological perspective. Corrupted manuscripts across the board on this topic? No evidence of that on your part - just a theory. It's the big elephant in the room that you have to deal with. Christianity rises or falls on that one event. If it's not real, the whole faith is worthless. \n \n \n It is useless prejudice to believe the world is a few thousand years old, or that evolution does not occur....\n\n \n I and a lot of other Christians don't hold to the earth being a few thousand years old. IMO the Bible doesn't even teach that. I also support evolution with the caveat that it is micro-evolution that is occurring, as opposed to macro-evolution.\n \n \n With the testimony of creation debunked, how much less worthy are a couple of peripheral passages about gay sex?\n\n \n Sorry, Biblical creationism has hardly been debunked. For every argument made from your quarters there is a reasonable rebuttal from the other side. On the other hand, you have some pretty enormous leaps of faith on your end. It appears to me science still has a long ways to go in explaining its version of creation - like where did the universe come from and how did it occur? How specifically did abiogenesis occur? If the universe is infinitely old, why hasn't total entropy occurred already, etc. ? These are important issues that your side is unable to credibly deal with. Oh, you have lots of theories, but little in the way of backing them up. In short, you have you own \"faith\" that you have to believe in on these issues. \n \n \n There are all kinds of cults around the world, right now. Would you expect unbiased reporting from within their ranks about their spiritual leaders? Would their desire to convince others naturally lead them to tell the truth, or to edit, omit, distort and exaggerate? How chronically gullible would you think me to be if I accepted everything every one of those cults claimed at face value, just because some parts of their 'holy books' were internally consistent or mentioned names and places documented elsewhere?\n\n \n This reminds me of the people who used to claim King David was a myth because there wasn't any archaeological evidence to back him up. Of course, that was before the Tel Dan tablets were discovered. There's a long, long track record of claims of myth against the Bible where the skeptics have had to eat their words. Places only previously known to have been mentioned in the Bible have now been discovered. You just have to investigate these on a case by case basis to understand the Bible has a significantly superior track record compared to other religions. Add to that predictive prophecy and the historical eyewitness reports, and you have a long ways to go before you make a decent dent in the Bible, and specifically in the New Testament. \n \n Cheers....",

   "DANIEL'S SEVENTY WEEKS - A Prophecy of the Christ\n \n (The majority of the following text is taken from The Search for Messiah, by Mark Eastman, M. D., and Chuck Smith, pages 103 - 115).\n \n Circa 537 B.C.\n \n While in captivity in ancient Babylon, the Old Testament Hebrew prophet Daniel was visited by the angel Gabriel and given the following prophecy concerning the future of the Israeli people, and their coming Messiah:\n \n \"Seventy 'sevens' are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy. Know and understand this: From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the 'Anointed One,' the ruler, comes, there will be seven 'sevens' and sixty-two 'sevens.' It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble. After the sixty-two 'sevens,' the Anointed One will be 'cut off,' and will have nothing (He will be 'cut off,' but not for himself - KJV). The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary.\"\n Daniel 9:24-26\n \n At the time that this prophecy was given, Jerusalem had been completely destroyed by the Babylonian empire some 70 years earlier. Most of the Israelis had been taken captive and deported to Babylon and the surrounding areas. Yet the time of their captivity was about to end. The Israelis were about to be set free by the Medo-Persian king Cyrus.\n \n \"Shabua:\" Literally \"sevened,\" i.e. a week (specifically of years). (Old Testament Word Study - Zodhiates - Hebrew Dictionary, page 111).\n \n In looking at the prophecy of Daniel, we see that the term 'seventy sevens' are determined for the people of Israel. In Hebrew the word translated as \"sevens\" is the plural form of the word \"shabua,\" which literally means \"a week of years;\" much like the English word decade means ten years (for an in-depth study of the word \"shabua\" as it relates to \"a week of years,\" I refer the reader to Alva J. McClain's work, Daniel's Prophecy of the 70 Weeks). \n \n The prophecy declares that Daniel should \"know and understand\" that from the going forth of the command to restore and rebuild Jerusalem, until Messiah the Prince comes, there will be \"sixty-two sevens\" and \"seven sevens\" of years (sixty-nine \"sevens\"). Therefore, if a seven (shabua) is seven years, then 69 sevens is 483 years (69 X 7 = 483 years). A number of scholars maintain that at that time in history most of the known ancient calendars calculated a year as 360 days (i.e. Chinese, Mayan, Egyptian, Hebrew, Babylonian, etc.). It is commonly understood that for prophetic calendars the Jews used a 360 day calendar year. If we can determine the exact time period of the prophecy, as well as the starting date of it, we can determine the appointed time for the coming of the Messiah - the Christ.\n \n Now that we know what period of time we are talking about for the first sixty-nine weeks (483 years) we can break this down into actual days:\n \n 483 years X 360 days = 173,880 total days.\n \n Now all we need is to ascertain the starting date for these 173,880 days, and see where it takes us. But is there any record of a command being given to \"restore and rebuild\" Jerusalem? Surprisingly, there is. In the second chapter of the book of Nehemiah (written about 450 B.C.) we read:\n \n \"In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, I (Nehemiah) took wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never been sad in his presence before. Therefore the king said to me, 'why is your face sad, since you are not sick?' \n Nehemiah 2:1-2\n \n Nehemiah went on to explain that he was sad because the city of his people, Jerusalem, was still desolate. So he requested that he be allowed to go back to Jerusalem and rebuild the city. Nehemiah also requested that the king grant a letter of authorization to obtain timber and safe passage through the territories of the ruling governors. The Bible records that King Artaxerxes granted Nehemiah the permission he desired, defining the moment in time when the first sixty-nine weeks of Daniel begins:\n \n \"And because the gracious hand of my God was upon me, the king granted my requests.\"\n Nehemiah 2:8\n \n The Encyclopedia Brittanica states that King Artaxerxes Longimanus ascended to the throne of the Medo-Persian empire in July 465 B.C. By Hebrew tradition, when the day of the month is not specifically stated, it is given to be the first day of that month. Accordingly, the day of the decree by Artaxerxes to restore and rebuild Jerusalem was then the first day of the Hebrew month Nisan 445 B.C. (note that 445 B.C. is the \"twentieth year\" of the reign of Artaxerxes - Nehemiah 2:1). The first day of Nisan 445 B.C. corresponds to the 14th day of March.\n \n Remember that Daniel's prophecy states that 69 weeks of years (173,880 days) after the command goes forth to rebuild Jerusalem, the Messiah must come. If we now count 173,880 days forward from the 14th day of March, 445 B.C., we come to April 6, 32 A.D. (Note that in the following calculations we will be using the standard 365 day year in our calculations. The calculations are:\n \n March 14, 445 B.C. to March 14, 32 A D. is 476 years, or 173,740 days (note that 1 B.C. to 1 A.D. is one year- there is no zero year).\n \n 476 years X 365 days = 173,740 days.\n Add for leap years = 116 days\n March 14th to April 6th = 24 days.\n \n Total: 173,880 days\n \n So April 6, 32 A.D. is the date prophesied by Daniel as the moment when the Christ would arrive as the Messiah of the Jewish people (note that at the time the prophecy was given, Jerusalem had been destroyed. Now, 483 years later, Jerusalem and the \"Second Temple\" had been rebuilt, just as Daniel predicted). \n \n \n VERIFICATION FROM THE GOSPEL OF LUKE\n \n Amazingly, from the Gospel of Luke, we will be able to provide exact verification of the date of Daniel's prophecy.\n \n In the third chapter of the Gospel of Luke, it states that in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and began his ministry. The 1997 Encyclopedia Brittanica states that the reign of Caesar Tiberius started on August 19, 14 A.D. Most Biblical scholars agree that Christ was baptized in the fall of the year. Consequently, according to Luke, chapter three, the ministry of Jesus started with his baptism in the fall of the fifteenth year of the reign of Caesar Tiberius (in 28 A.D. - the \"first\" year of the reign of Caesar Tiberius was 14 A.D., so the \"fifteenth year\" of his reign would be 28 A.D.). And, according to most scholars, his ministry lasted four Passovers, or 3 1/2 years. The first Passover of Jesus' ministry would have been in the spring of 29 A.D. The fourth Passover of his ministry was the day of his crucifixion and would have fallen in the year 32 A.D. The Passover in that year fell on April 10th. Remarkably, the Sunday before that Passover was April 6th. April 6, 32 A.D.\n \n Jesus was baptized in the fall of the year 28 A.D.\n The first Passover of his ministry would have occurred in the spring of 29 A.D.\n The second Passover would have been in 30 A.D.\n The third Passover would have been in 31 A.D.\n The fourth Passover (his crucifixion) would then be in 32 A.D.\n \n Palm Sunday, April 6, 32 A.D., was exactly 173,880 days after Artaxerxes gave the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem (March 14, 445 B.C.). And that day was the first day that Jesus of Nazareth allowed his disciples to proclaim him as the Messiah. Interestingly, even Jesus himself recognized the importance of that date, for in Luke 19:41 and 19:44 (spoken on the day of his triumphal entry into Jerusalem the Sunday before the Passover) Jesus said,\n \n \"If you, even now, had only known on this day what would bring you peace - but now it is hidden from your eyes....you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you.\"\n \n Verification from the Gospel of John\n \n In John 2:20, Jesus said, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\" And even though Jesus was speaking about his body as the \"temple\" (John 2:21), the Jews nevertheless answered: \"It has taken forty-six years to build this temple.\" Historians agree that the temple wasn't completed until 64 AD. Since it wasn't complete, the Jews were really saying that it was in the forty-sixth year of its building at that time. Historians conclude that King Herod started building the Temple in 18 BC. Forty-six years later would come to 29 AD (only one year from 1 BC to 1 AD). Thus, the first Passover of Jesus was in 29 AD. Jesus' ministry covered four Passovers, once again leading us to the spring of 32 AD.\n \n And so, the first sixty-nine weeks of Daniel drew to a close. Remember the prophecy - that the Messiah must come at the appointed time when Jerusalem was rebuilt - that transgression and sin must be atoned for (which he did on the cross), and that the Messiah must be \"cut off\" (killed), but not for himself (KJV), for others. Daniel 9:26 then goes on to state that after the Messiah had come and was \"cut off,\" then the city and the sanctuary (the 2nd temple) would be destroyed. So according to Daniel the Messiah would have to arrive before the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, which occurred in 70 A.D., when the Roman general Titus and his Twelfth Roman Legion sacked Jerusalem.\n \n \"Cut off\" - Hebrew word \"karath,\" meaning to \"down, asunder, or destroy.\" Related to covenant, originally by \"cutting flesh and passing between the pieces.\" (Old Testament Word Study - Hebrew Dictionary, page 57. Note the covenant sacrifice of Abraham in Genesis 15:17, a \"type\" of the Messianic sacrifice to come). \n \n Finally concerning the \"70th\" week of Daniel (the \"Time of Jacob's Trouble\" aka as the \"Great Tribulation,\" which is to occur in the days immediately proceeding Christ's second coming), I refer the reader to Alva J. McClain's Daniel's Prophecy of the 70 Weeks.\n \n WHAT THE ANCIENT JEWISH RABBIS SAID\n \n Christianity has its roots in Judaism, and accepts the Old Testament (the \"Tenach\" in Hebrew - an acronym for the Old Testament Scriptures consisting of the Torah, Prophets, and Writings) as the divine word of God. Today, many Jewish Rabbis try to deny the messianic application of Daniel's prophecy. However, it is well established in history that ancient Jews believed Daniel's prophecy pinpointed the time of the Messiah's coming. For instance, in the Babylonian Talmud, complied between 200 - 500 A.D., Rabbi Judah (the main compiler of the Talmud), said concerning Daniel's prophecy:\n \n \"These times were over long ago.\"\n (Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 98b and 97a)\n \n In the 12th Century A.D., Rabbi Moses Ben Maimon (Maimonides), one of the most respected rabbis in history, and a man who rejected Jesus as the Messiah, said:\n \n \"Daniel has elucidated to us the knowledge of the end times.\n However, since they are secret, the wise (rabbis) have barred\n the calculations of the days of Messiah's coming so that the\n untutored populace will not be led astray when they see that\n end times have already come but there is no sign of the Messiah.\"\n \n In addition, Rabbi Moses Abraham Levi said regarding the time of the Messiah's coming:\n \n \"I have examined and searched all the Holy Scriptures and have\n not found the time for the coming of Messiah clearly fixed, except\n in the words of Gabriel to the prophet Daniel, which are written\n in the 9th chapter of the prophecy of Daniel.\"\n \n In the Targum of the Prophets, in the Tractate Megillah 3a, the Rabbi Jonathan ben Uzziel noted, concerning Daniel's prophecy:\n \n \"The date of the Messiah was foretold in it.\"\n \n Rabbi Elias, who lived 200 years before Jesus, wrote:\n \n \"The world endures 6000 years; Two thousand before the law\n (before Moses), two thousand with the law and two thousand\n with the Messiah.\" (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 96b - 99a)\n \n \n Grotius quotes Rabbi Nehumias, (who lived in the generation preceding the birth of Christ) as saying, \"Whoever the Messiah is, he must appear within the next fifty years.\"\n \n \n REFERENCES\n \n Eastman, Mark, and Smith, Chuck.

   "Until Shiloh Comes (following by Chuck Missler)\n \n In the 49th chapter of the book of Genesis there is another specific prophecy regarding the time of the Messiah's coming. In verse one we read of the last blessing that Jacob bestowed to his sons.\n \n \"And Jacob called his sons and said, 'Gather together, that I may tell you what shall befall you in the last days'\" Genesis 49:1 (NKJ) \n When he had gathered them together he began to prophesy over each of them. When he got to his son Judah, he gave a prophecy concerning the Messiah:\n \n \"The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to him shall be the obedience of the people.\" Genesis 49:10 (NKJ)\n \n This strange prophecy has a few words that need to be defined in order to be fully understood. The word \"scepter\" has been understood by the Rabbis to mean the \"tribal staff\" or \"tribal identity\" of the twelve tribes of Israel. This \"tribal identity\" was linked, in the minds of the Jews, to their right to apply and enforce Mosaic law upon the people, including the right to adjudicate capital cases and administer capital punishment, or jus gladii (The jus gladii is a legal term which refers to the legal authority to adjudicate capital cases and impose capital punishment.) \n \n Secondly, it is well documented that the word \"Shiloh\" has been understood for millennia to be an idiom for the Messiah. \n \n Therefore, according to this prophecy, the tribal identity or scepter of the tribe of Judah would not cease until the Messiah came. Judah was not only the name of the son of Jacob, but it was also the name of the southern kingdom of the divided nation of Israel. \n \n With these definitions in place we can restate the prophecy as follows: \n \"The [National identity of Judah, which includes the right to enforce Mosaic law, including the right to administer capital punishment upon the people, as called for in the Torah] shall not depart from [the southern kingdom (Judah) ], nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh [the Messiah] comes; and to him shall be the obedience of the people.\"\n \n This prophecy gives specific indicators regarding the time of the coming of the Messiah! The prophecy declares that he would come before the right to impose Jewish law (which includes capital punishment) is restricted and before the national identity of Judah is removed!\n \n During the 70-year Babylonian captivity, from 606-537 B.C., the southern kingdom of Israel, Judah, had lost it's national sovereignty, but retained it's tribal staff or national identity.2 It is very significant that in the book of Ezra we read that during the 70-year Babylonian captivity the Jews still retained their own lawgivers or judges.3 The Jews maintained their identity and judicial authority over their own people even during 70 years of slavery. The scepter had not been lost during the Babylonian captivity.\n \n During the next five centuries the Jews suffered under the yoke of the Medo-Persian, Greek and Roman Empires. Yet, Judah retained its tribal identity up until the first quarter of the first century A.D.\n \n In the first quarter of the first century A.D., the Jews were under Roman domination when an unprecedented event occurred. According to Josephus (Antiquities 17:13) around the year A.D. 6-7, the son and successor to King Herod, a man named Herod Archelaus, was dethroned and banished to Vienna, a city of Gaul.4 He was replaced, not by a Jewish king, but by a Roman Procurator named Caponius. The legal power of the Sanhedrin was then immediately restricted. \n \n With the ascension of Caponius, the Sanhedrin lost their ability to adjudicate capital cases. This was the normal policy toward all the nations under the yoke of the Romans. The province of Judea had, however, been spared from this policy up to this point. However, Caesar Agustus had had enough of the Jews and finally removed the judicial authority from them at the ascension of Caponius. This transfer of power was recorded by Josephus.5\n \n \"And now Archelaus' part of Judea was reduced into a province, and Caponius, one of the equestrian order of the Romans, was sent as a procurator, having the power of life and death put into his hands by Caesar!\"(Emphasis added) \n \n The power of the Sanhedrin to adjudicate capital cases was immediately removed. In the minds of the Jewish leadership, this event signified the removal of the scepter or national identity of the tribe of Judah! \n \n If you think that this is a Christian contrivance, think again. Here are several ancient rabbinical references that indicate that the rabbis believed that Genesis 49:10 was referring to the Messiah.\n \n In the Targum Onkelos it states: \n \"The transmission of domain shall not cease from the house of Judah, nor the scribe from his children's children, forever, until Messiah comes.\"6 \n In the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan it states: \n \"King and rulers shall not cease from the house of Judah...until King Messiah comes\"7 \n \n The Targum Yerushalmi states: \n \"Kings shall not cease from the house of Judah...until the time of the coming of the King Messiah...to whom all the dominions of the earth shall become subservient\"7 \n \n In the Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 98b, Rabbi Johanan said: \n \"The world was created for the sake of the Messiah, what is this Messiah's name? The school of Rabbi Shila said 'his name is Shiloh, for it is written; until Shiloh come.'\"\n \n These amazing commentaries should eliminate any doubt that the Jews that lived prior to the Christian era believed that one of the names of the Messiah was Shiloh. Furthermore, these quotes should eliminate all doubt that the ancient rabbis believed that the Messiah would come before the removal of the scepter from Judah! \n \n Woe Unto Us, For Messiah Has Not Appeared! \n \n So far we have established that Shiloh is an idiom for the Messiah and that the scepter (that is, the tribal identity, associated with the right to impose capital punishment) had departed from the kingdom of Judah early in the first quarter of the first century. What was the reaction of the Jews when the right to adjudicate capital cases (the jus gladii) was removed from Judah? Did they view the removal of their authority on capital cases as the removal of the scepter from Judah? The answer can be categorically stated as YES! \n When Archelaus was banished, the power of the Sanhedrin was severely curtailed. Capital cases could no longer be tried by the Sanhedrin. Such cases were now transferred to the Roman Procurator, Caponius. This transfer of power is even mentioned in the Talmud:\n \n \"A little more than forty years before the destruction of the Temple, the power of pronouncing capital sentences was taken away from the Jews.\"8 \n This certainly corresponds to the same event recorded by Josephus we saw earlier. In Antiquities 20:9 Josephus again points out that the Sanhedrin had no authority over capital cases: \n \n \"After the death of the procurator Festus, when Albinus was about to succeed him , the high priest Ananias considered it a favorable opportunity to assembly the Sanhedrin. He therefore caused James the Brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, and several others, to appear before this hastily assembled council, and pronounced upon them the sentence of death by stoning. All the wise men and strict observers of the law who were at Jerusalem expressed their disapprobation of this act...Some even went to Albinus himself , who had departed to Alexandria, to bring this breach of the law under his observation, and to inform him that Ananius had acted illegally in assembling the Sanhedrin without the Roman authority.\" \n \n This remarkable passage not only mentions Jesus of Nazareth and his brother James as historical figures, but it also declares that the Sanhedrin had no authority to pass the death sentence upon any man!`\n \n The jus gladii, the right to impose the death sentence, had been removed. The remaining authority of Judah had been taken away by the Romans in the early years of the first century. The scepter had departed from Judah. Its royal and legal powers were removed; but where was Shiloh? \n The reaction of the Jews to these monumental events is recorded in the Talmud. Augustin Lemann, in his book Jesue before the Sanhedrin, records a statement by Rabbi Rachmon:\n \n \"When the members of the Sanhedrin found themselves deprived of their right over life and death, a general consternation took possession of them: they covered their heads with ashes, and their bodies with sackcloth, exclaiming: 'Woe unto us for the scepter has departed from Judah and the Messiah has not come'\"9,10,11 (emphasis added) \n The scepter was smitten from the hands of the tribe of Judah. The kingdom of Judea, the last remnant of the greatness of Israel, was debased into being merely a part of the province of Syria. \n \n While the Jews wept in the streets of Jerusalem, there was growing up in the city of Nazareth the young son of a Jewish carpenter, Jesus of Nazareth. The inescapable conclusion was that Shiloh had come! Only then was the Scepter removed! \n \n References: \n Missler, Chuck, Eastman, Mark, M.D.\"The Creator Beyond Time and Space\", The Word for Today 1996, p.144-149 \n Chuck Missler and Mark Eastman M.D. references: \n -1.

New York 1969 \n \n Until Shiloh Comes - Part II\n \n That Shiloh is the Messiah is reflected in the Aramaic Tar-gum of Onkelos where the phrase is rendered, \"until Messiah comes to whom belongs the kingdom....\"(5) Similarly, Pseudo-Jonathan paraphrases the scripture, \"until the time that King Messiah shall come....\"(6) The Talmud also lends support to the interpretation that Shiloh was a reference to the Messiah: Rabbi Yohanan taught that all the world was created for the Messiah. What is His name? The School of Sheeloh taught: His name is Shiloh as it is written (Genesis 49:10) 'Until Shiloh come and unto Him shall the gathering of the peoples be.(7) The same exegesis is followed in Midrashic passages. Midrash Rabbah Genesis states: 'He stooped down, he couched like a lion' (Genesis 49:9). Some interpret it to mean, 'He couched, ' that is, He waited from Zedekiah until King Messiah.(8) Similarly, Midrash Tanhuma relates the passage to King Messiah when it states: 'The scepter shall not depart.' This means the kingly throne....'The lawgiver from between his feet,'...refers to the time when the King will come to whom belongs the Kingdom. TheYalkut relates the word Shiloh as a contraction of shai-ladonai, words which appear in the Book of Isaiah meaning \"gift to the Lord. \" It achieves the same result and interprets the term to relate to the Messiah: 'Until Shiloh shall come; He is called by the name of Shiloh because all the nations are destined to bring gifts to Israel and to King Messiah, as it is written, 'In that day shall the present be brought to the Lord of hosts.'(9) Judah Shall Legislate Until Messiah Come During the great controversies in the Middle Ages between advocates of rabbinic Judaism and its opponents, believers in Yeshua invoked the prophetic passage that \"the scepter should not depart from Judah ... until Shiloh come,\" as proof the Messiahship of Yeshua(Jesus) of Nazareth. They maintained that there was a continuity of leadership in Judea until Yeshua came, then it had ceased. The rabbinic scholars maintained that this could not be, since the Judean kingdom had come to an end in 586 B.C.E., close to 600 years before Yeshua. \n \n References Part II: (1)Genesis 49:8-10 (2)Midrash Rabbah Genesis 98:3 (3)J.W.

   "Well, that's your opinion. What they documented was the miracle itself. \n\n \n No; they documented a sequence of events which could not have occurred as described. And again, the miracle itself is not the problem.\n \n I read a great deal of science fiction, fantasy, and the occasional horror novel. All these genres require the reader to suspend disbelief regarding the existence of magical creatures, pseudo-scientific principles or boogeymen, and I'm happy to do so. But if the people in the story behave out of character or against their nature, it's like encountering a stinger-strip tossed across a motorway:\n \n \nAnd when he had broken the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. 20. And they all ate, and were satisfied, and carried away what remained of the fragments 2 twelve baskets full.\n\n \n \nAnd when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, raising his eyes to heaven, he blessed, 5 and brake the loaves, and gave to the disciples to set before them, and divided the two fishes among them all. 42. And they all ate, and were satisfied. 43. And they carried away twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes.\n\n \n \nAnd, taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he raised his eyes to heaven, and blessed them, and broke them, 7 and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude. 17. And they all ate, and were satisfied; and there was carried away what was left of the fragments twelve baskets.\n\n \n \"And they all ate, and were satisfied.\"\n \n Glossing over rather a lot, isn't it? The tedious faffing about over how many loaves, and whether they should order in or send everyone home, and what Jesus said and what the disciples said - all rendered in excruciating detail, and then the main event: \"And they all ate, and were satisfied.\"\n \n No reaction from the assembled throng; no reaction from the disciples - who, according to the texts, had no idea what was about to happen. Nothing occurred to impede in the slightest the orderly distribution of five thousand handfuls of magically reproducing bread and fish. And all three supposedly independent stories, from independent viewpoints, are almost verbatim copies, detailed and vague in exactly the same places, using the same words to gloss over the miracle itself. If three schoolkids handed in those stories as 'independent' accounts of a shared day out, you'd haul them up for copying each other's work.\n \n Is it asking so much to require a little authenticity?\n \n \nIsn't that a little like not being able to see the forest for the trees? Again, if you want to discredit Christianity, you have to go after the resurrection.\n\n \n And again, I'm not trying to discredit the whole of christianity. I'm not trying to prove it was a top-to-bottom sham. I don't need to go after what you perceive as christianity's unassailable core because - as we have already agreed, biblical christianity is not an indivisible, atomic unit of faith, either entirely true or entirely false. As we have already agreed, it is possible that its writers on occasion contributed their own slant; their own values.\n \n \nI and a lot of other Christians don't hold to the earth being a few thousand years old. IMO the Bible doesn't even teach that.\n\n \n Yet in the opinion of others, it does. So you cherry-pick the parts you agree with or the interpretation you take - but on whose authority? What divine value is there in teachings if you get to select the ones you obey?\n \n \nI also support evolution with the caveat that it is micro-evolution that is occurring, as opposed to macro-evolution.\n\n \n All those intermediate fossils and ongoing, observable speciation must make that caveat kind of strenuous to maintain ;) Where exactly do you draw the line between micro and macro evolution? Presumably you're OK with all mammals - certainly all primates - having common ancestry, since we differ only in detail...?\n \n Anyway, that's an argument for another thread.\n \n \nSorry, Biblical creationism has hardly been debunked. For every argument made from your quarters there is a reasonable rebuttal from the other side.\n\n \n That simply isn't true, however many times it is claimed. The bull-pudding may get more sophisticated depending on the audience, but that's all. I've seen creationist books for schoolchildren, showing an animal with the front half of a cow and the back half of a whale, to illustrate why intermediate species would have been at a disadvantage in both environments. I've heard professors at religiously-funded creationist 'research facilities' misquote the laws of thermodynamics in order to 'prove' evolution can't happen. I've had another professor explain to me, quite earnestly, how the butterfly disproves evolution because there's no advantage to spending millions of years disolving into a soup of proteins in the hope you'll come out as a butterfly. \n \n It's not reasonable rebuttal, it's just noise; the desperate mating call of a faith on the brink of insignificance.\n \n And when the bull-pudding runs out, at the cutting edge of evolutionary theory, the argument invariably turns into this one:\n \n \n It appears to me science still has a long ways to go in explaining its version of creation\n\n \n To which the answer is: we're working on it. Science doesn't pretend to have all the answers; that's one of the reasons it's science, and the main reason we have neat things like computers and cures for some kinds of cancer. I suppose since science can't cure all cancer yet, its achievements are meaningless?\n \n \nIn short, you have you own \"faith\" that you have to believe in on these issues.\n\n \n And that's where you're wrong - where those of a religious mentality will always be wrong when they try to shout down those working to enlighten humanity.\n \n Next time, before you accuse someone else of employing faith, perform the following mental experiment: imagine the principle or theory under discussion being erased from every written record and every conscious mind. If that principle or theory can be rediscovered through observation and logical conjecture, it's not a matter of faith: it is an abstraction of something that can be demonstrated to occur in nature.",

Myself and tens of millions of others like me don't agree. It goes to the mindset of the author. If he is one who just likes to report the main facts and not go into elaborate detail, then I don't see any problem with it. And since you aren't privy to the author's mindset, but just your own desires on what you think someone else's writing style ought to be, then you are simply theorizing. A few facts now and then to support your theory might be helpful.\n \n \n No reaction from the assembled throng; no reaction from the disciples - who, according to the texts, had no idea what was about to happen.

If three schoolkids handed in those stories as 'independent' accounts of a shared day out, you'd haul them up for copying each other's work.\n\n \n It's an argument from silence to suggest there was no reaction. There may well have been quite a bit of it, but again, it goes to the author's mindset of what he chooses to cover.\n \n If you read the different Gospel accounts carefully they aren't \"exact\" as you claim. But if they were substantially different you'd argue they couldn't agree on what exactly occurred. Whichever case suits your cause. But what we do have is multiple confirmations of the miracle itself. Now, is that a mass conspiracy? Mass hysteria? What? Please submit some evidence to back up your theory if possible. \n \n \n So you cherry-pick the parts you agree with or the interpretation you take - but on whose authority? What divine value is there in teachings if you get to select the ones you obey?\n\n \n Who's picking and choosing? I accept it all unless there's evidence to the contrary that a certain passage is late dated or not trustworthy (as in a few late dated passages like the one in John where Jesus told the adulteress to go and sin no more). Yet even there we know adultery is a sin from numerous other Old and New Testament passages, so I wouldn't consider that out of character with the totality of Scripture. \n \n \nAnd that's where you're wrong - where those of a religious mentality will always be wrong when they try to shout down those working to enlighten humanity.\n\n \n I think it's a little arrogant to characterize the 90% of Americans who believe in God as the ones who are not enlightened. I also take note that there seems to be an awful lot of atheists and anti-Christian skeptics these days who take great pride in trying to shout down anyone who disagrees with them. It works both ways.\n \n \nNext time, before you accuse someone else of employing faith, perform the following mental experiment: imagine the principle or theory under discussion being erased from every written record and every conscious mind. If that principle or theory can be rediscovered through observation and logical conjecture, it's not a matter of faith: it is an abstraction of something that can be demonstrated to occur in nature.\n\n \n Everyone operates out of faith on some things. Me, you, and everyone we know. We have faith we're going to get paid for wages earned; we have faith that eating food prepared by others in quick food restaurants won't kill us; we have faith in all sorts of things that we hope or expect will occur. So, welcome to the club. \n \n Now, going back to a previous post, the motive you gave for the NT writers providing their various accounts was \"so that others could believe\" (paraphrasing). Like I said, that's a good motive for the New Testament being true. But what I'm asking you for is what motive would there be for them if the New Testament accounts of Jesus were not true? Remember, tradition and historical accounts from both the Bible and non-biblical sources indicate certain of these individuals were greatly persecuted or killed for their beliefs. Why should all these people want to bring that kind of grief on themselves if what they wrote were untrue or just nonsense? \n \n Lastly, I'd like to ask you to narrow down your theories about the New Testament to the one or ones most logical to you. For instance, pick one that you have some evidence for, instead of all these theories (no offense). If you want to argue that the New Testament is badly corrupted to the point that even multiple confirmations of a particular event is questionable, then identify which specific event got corrupted, and when and how specifically did that alleged corruption occur (along with your evidence)? \n \n Cheers...",

However, that is not what the vast majority of biblical scholarshpi believes. From http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=34&letter=D\n \n \n\n The Book of Daniel was written during the persecutions of Israel by the Syrian king Antiochus Epiphanes. This assertion is supported by the following data: The kingdom which is symbolized by the he goat (viii. 5 et seq.) is expressly named as the \"kingdom of Yawan\"-that is, the Grecian kingdom (viii. 21) the great horn being its first king, Alexander the Great (definitely stated in Seder \"Olam R. xxx.), and the little horn Antiochus Epiphanes (175-164). This kingdom was to persecute the host of the saints \"unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings\" (viii. 14, R. V.); that is, \"half-days,\" or 1,150 days; and Epiphanes did, in fact, profane the sanctuary in Jerusalem for about that length of time, from Kislew 15, 168, to Kislew 25,165 (I Macc. i. 57, iv. 52). The little horn described in Dan. viii. 9-12, 23-25 has the same general characteristics as the little horn in vii. 8, 20; hence the same ruler is designated in both passages. The well-known passage ix. 23-27 also points to the same period. The first and imperative rule in interpreting it is to begin the period of the seventy times seven units (A. V. \"seventy weeks\") with the first period of seven (ix. 25), and to let the second period, the \"sixty-two times seven units,\" follow this; forif this second period (the sixty-two weeks) be reckoned as beginning again from the very beginning, the third period, the \"one week,\" must be carried back in the same way. The context demands, furthermore, that the origin of the prediction concerning the rebuilding of Jerusalem be sought in Jer. xxv. 11-13 and the parallel passage, ib. xxix. 10. The \"anointed,\" the \"prince,\" mentioned after the first seven times seven units, must be Cyrus, who is called the anointed of the Lord in Isa. xlv. 1 also. He concluded the first seven weeks of years by issuing the decree of liberation, and the time that elapsed between the Chaldean destruction of Jerusalem (586) and the year 538 was just about forty-nine years. The duration of the sixty-two times seven units (434 years) does not correspond with the time 538-171 (367 years); but the chronological knowledge of that age was not very exact. The Seder 'Olam Zu&#7789;a (ed. Meyer, p. 104) computed the Persian rule to have lasted fifty-two years. This is all the more evident as the last period of seven units must include the seven years 171-165 (see \"Rev. Et. Juives,\" xix. 202 et seq.). This week of years began with the murder of an anointed one (compare Lev. iv. 3 et seq. on the anointing of the priest)-namely, the legitimate high priest Onias III.-and it was in the second half of this week of years that the Temple of the Lord was desecrated by an abomination-the silver altar erected by Antiochus Epiphanes in place of the Lord's altar for burnt offering (see I Macc. i. 54).\n \n",

Why the previous \"Goodbye\" thread if you're going to hang around? Why not do another thread titled, \"I'm Back\"?\n\n \n \n Yes, Josephus thought differently. However, Josephus was not very accurate about many many things. He was a prolific writer, who recorded a lot in that time period, HOwever, he was wrong about many things. From\n http://www.centuryone.com/josephus.html\n \n \n\n Was Josephus always correct? Certainly not. His inaccuracies range from vagueness to blatant exaggeration. Shaye Cohen accuses him of \"inveterate sloppiness\".19 The index to Cohen's book goes so far as actually to include entries for \"exaggeration\", \"inconsistency and sloppiness\" and \"corrupt transmission of names and numbers\".20 Indeed, even if it is accepted that copyists were responsible for not a few of his mistakes (some of which have been hinted at already), it still cannot be denied that he was by nature somewhat negligent.21 The list of scholars who have deprecated his errors is long22 but suffice it to mention here the accusations of tow eminent archaeologists alone, since archaeology is the central theme of the present discussion. Albright remarks on \"how inaccurate Josephus generally was in details . . .\"23 Vincent goes even further. \"Il serait superflu\", he maintains, \"d'accentuer de nouveau la futilite de toute evaluation fondee sur les chiffres de Josephe.\"24 However, a remark on the previous page, to the effect that a particular item of information is an \"excellente approsimation\",25 reflects the reaction typical of scholars investigating Josephus' data.\n \n This duality of sharp criticism alongside fulsome appreciation has consistently accompanied the scholarly treatment of Josephus' works. It has not been our intention here to prove that he is always exact of correct in every statement, but to show that his data are in many instances accurate, and that they stem from reliable sources to which he had access from the very beginning of his literary career.\n \n",

We'll see.\n \n \nAlexander the Great and Daniel\n \n JOSEPHUS [Antiquities, 11.8.5] mentions that Alexander the Great had designed to punish the Jews for their fidelity to Darius, but that Jaddua (332 B.C.), the high priest, met him at the head of a procession and averted his wrath by showing him Daniel's prophecy that a Grecian monarch should overthrow Persia. Certain it is, Alexander favored the Jews, and JOSEPHUS' statement gives an explanation of the fact; at least it shows that the Jews in JOSEPHUS' days believed that Daniel was extant in Alexander's days, long before the Maccabees.\n \n \n This fails to address any of the points I made above, points which result from a critical examination of Daniel by contemporary biblical scholars, based upon the contents of the book. Josephus (37 CE - 100 CE) was a historian whose writings must be taken with a considerable grain of salt. Why not, instead, address the issues which I (and others) have raised regarding Daniel? Don't like the above source? Here's another...\n \n The literary setting (of Daniel) is not the setting in which the book was actually written. The fact that ch. 11 obviously refers to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Seleucid ruler from Syria, makes it clear that the book took its final form during Antiochus's persecution of the Jews, which began with the desecration of the temple in 167 BCE. -- NRSV Study Bible, Harper Collins Pub.\n \n \nAnd long before the liberal theologians.\n\n \n 'Scholarly' does not equate to 'liberal'. \n \n \np.s.

   "Again, that's your opinion. Myself and tens of millions of others like me don't agree. It goes to the mindset of the author.\n\n \n No, it goes to the mindset of the reader. You (and tens of millions of others) are ready to believe such an event could 'just happen', and aren't the slightest bit interested in how. You choose to deaden the mind's palate and gulp the lot down untasted.\n \n \nIt's an argument from silence to suggest there was no reaction. There may well have been quite a bit of it, but again, it goes to the author's mindset of what he chooses to cover. <snip< If you read the different Gospel accounts carefully they aren't \"exact\" as you claim. But if they were substantially different you'd argue they couldn't agree on what exactly occurred.\n \n \n Not at all. There's a world of difference between contradictory accounts and overlapping, consistent but distinct accounts. What we have here is like three reporters covering one of the greatest football matches ever, and all independently deciding to report the final score, an identical set of details from the pre-match entertainment, but none of the actual plays.\n \n \nBut what we do have is multiple confirmations of the miracle itself. Now, is that a mass conspiracy?\n\n \n Three accounts (or is it four?) from men who all knew and spent considerable time with one another hardly requires a mass conspiracy. And it's childishly obvious that either those three accounts were written in collusion or that two were written with the third used for reference.\n \n I thought the story was silly when I heard it in Sunday school; reading the three passages side by side now, 'silly' hardly seems sufficient. 'Blatantly falsified' perhaps, or 'Inept collaboration' is closer to the mark.\n \n \nWho's picking and choosing? I accept it all unless there's evidence to the contrary that a certain passage is late dated or not trustworthy\n\n \n So which is the alleged creation of plants before the sun: late dated or untrustworthy?\n \n \nI think it's a little arrogant to characterize the 90% of Americans who believe in God as the ones who are not enlightened. \n\n \n 85% of Americans don't have a passport. Is it arrogant to characterise them as not well-travelled? \n \n 85% of four year olds believe in Santa; is it arrogance to characterise them as not enlightened? Imagine if, as you grew up, your parents and peers maintained the fiction of Santa. In the face of a stranger trying to enlighten you now, would you defend Santa with any less zeal than you do god?\n \n \nEveryone operates out of faith on some things. Me, you, and everyone we know. We have faith we're going to get paid for wages earned; we have faith that eating food prepared by others in quick food restaurants won't kill us; we have faith in all sorts of things that we hope or expect will occur.\n\n \n I'm disappointed you didn't trot out the ever-popular and equally flawed 'getting on a plane' analogy. I could have copied and pasted a response to that one :) Anyway:\n \n There are an infinity of possibilities that I don't expect to happen. But that's different from actively expecting the reverse. You may as well say I have faith that my next step won't send me flying off into space, or plunge me to the centre of the earth (where I would at least have something to eat :) ). A good analogy might be to ask if a tropical native who has never seen or heard of ice 'believes' that water is always liquid. Clearly he believes no such thing. Thus: failure to consider possible alternatives is not faith.\n \n If I do consider alternatives, it is reason which convinces me. I always have been paid at the end of the month. The company is, to my knowledge, in good shape; I have no reason to expect that to change before then. The probable outcome, upon which I will base my behaviour, is that I will get paid. To act otherwise would be irrational. \n \n Similarly, the thought never previously entered my head to wonder if my next Whopper would be full of strychnine, but now that it has I can judge from the lack of recent newspaper headlines on the issue that it isn't very likely. It'll probably just be full of calories.\n \n Faith is the conscious belief that things are one way rather than another in the absence, or in spite of, sufficient evidence to make an informed judgement. You, for example, are demonstrating tremendous faith in the unadulterated truth of the bible. Isn't that so?\n \n \nNow, going back to a previous post, the motive you gave for the NT writers providing their various accounts was \"so that others could believe\" (paraphrasing). Like I said, that's a good motive for the New Testament being true.\n\n \n And like I said, that's nonsense. Having an agenda - however well-meaning - is never conducive to objective honesty. Have you ever met a salesman?\n \n \nLastly, I'd like to ask you to narrow down your theories about the New Testament to the one or ones most logical to you.\n\n \n So far I have advanced only two hypotheses (though I'm flattered you would describe them as theories): \n \n 1) The possibility exists that at least some of the bible was written by men without the benefit of divine inspiration.\n \n 2) FTFT did not occur as described.\n \n We have already agreed that 1) has been proved. 2) was more of an aside, but I'm happy to use it as part of the continuing argument. No 'narrowing down' is required.\n \n \nFor instance, pick one that you have some evidence for, instead of all these theories (no offense). If you want to argue that the New Testament is badly corrupted to the point that even multiple confirmations of a particular event is questionable, then identify which specific event got corrupted, and when and how specifically did that alleged corruption occur (along with your evidence)?\n\n \n If a teacher receives three sets of homework (reports of a school trip to a museum all three pupils, known to be fast friends, supposedly attended) that are thinly disguised copies of one another, differing only slightly in wording and not at all in substance, structure or the distribution of detail and omission, does she need to know or be able to prove exactly when the plagiarism occurred and who copied from whom in order to give them detention?\n \n Furthermore, if all three accounts describe the coach journey in tedious detail but omit any specifics of the destination itself, would she not also reasonably conclude that they had in fact sloped off for a smoke and never been in the museum at all? Especially if she knew there had been a fire alarm, which none of the accounts mentioned?\n \n That's an everyday event for which the teacher has independent confirmation. I don't know the 'fire alarm' went off during the FTFT, but I'm sure there must have been some pretty spectacular reactions from the public witnessing their first miracle occur over the course of an hour.\n \n We probably wouldn't be having this debate if the stories said something like this:\n \n 30 And as the bread was handed out, yet it did not diminish in the disciples' hands but instead multiplied no matter how quickly it was dispensed, and as each group of fifty there saw this they wept and rejoiced and praised god.\n 31 And John did exclaim in amazement, for he was teh n00b.\n 32: And at John's words there was much excitement and a clustering around of those not yet fed, and Jesus did have to speak most sharply to them, saying 'Wait thy bloody turn, there's plenty for everyone' before they would sit down again.\n \n Or words to that effect.\n \n FTFT is not a factual account of events from three independent corroborating sources, because if it was then A) the three versions of the story would have been merely consistent in what they described, rather than suspiciously identical in the way they were written, and B) something worth documenting would have occurred during the feeding.\n \n QED.",

I've actually have done 12 years of intensive, personal research on Biblical issues, which I don't think you have (or have you?). And if you ever give your life to Christ you'll get the Holy Spirit who will rock your worldview and provide a compelling and significant personal experience for you to reconsider your position. \n \n \nHaving an agenda - however well-meaning - is never conducive to objective honesty.\n\n \n Does that mean we should trash all our history books because they all had some kind of an \"agenda\"? Should no one ever listen to what you have to say because you have your own \"agenda,\" however well-meaning? Would all of what you then say never be conducive to objective honesty? \n \n \nSo far I have advanced only two hypotheses (though I'm flattered you would describe them as theories): \n\n \n I know, which is why I now prefer you actually dig up some facts.

For example, if you think the Gospel writers were wrong on a geographical or historical issue, then make your specific case and cite your argument and contrary evidence. If they didn't err then IMO that only lends more credibility to the remainder of what they wrote. I do strongly suggest you do your homework and look at arguments from both sides of the issue before you post one of them, though. \n \n Cheers....",

   "And you and tens of millions others are ready to believe it couldn't happen. Thus, your mindset.\n\n \n I'm not sure what kind of point you think you're making. Is it that skepticism is different from gullibility? If so, I happily concede. \n \n But I don't think that is your point. I think that, once again, as a person of faith (small f) you are wrongly assuming that when anyone adopts a contrary stance they too must be driven by unsupported prejudice.\n \n As a skeptic, I don't believe FTFT couldn't happen. I merely observe that it contradicts a number of quite thoroughly established natural laws, and am unconvinced by these three accounts to make an exception.\n \n \nyou will see they are not exactly \"identical.\" And again, if they aren't exactly identical you could make the argument that they can't all agree on various things.\n\n \n I responded to this claim in my last post; on what grounds are you choosing to ignore me? On what grounds do you claim that stories can only be either identical or inconsistent?\n \n If one account mentioned 4,000 people and the others 5,000, I personally would not hold that up as a contradiction (although I accept that some here might). Why? Because they wouldn't have done an exact headcount, and I can quite easily picture John saying 'We've got about five thousand people here, Jesus' and Matthew saying 'Well, more like four really, but it's still a hell of a lot' and I can further imagine their own estimates making it into their own accounts.\n \n My fundamental objection to the veracity of the three stories is that they all use the same words to entirely gloss over a miracle that must have taken the best part of a fairly eventful hour to play out. Not one of the three thought the appearance of the bread, their reaction to seeing the bread appear, or the reaction of the crowd worth a single verse.\n \n \nSorry, there's no factual foundation for your personal opinion on this that anything is falsified. \n\n \n Factual foundation? You are demanding that I produce factual evidence that a physically impossible event did not happen?\n \n Let's be clear about this: the burden of proof is not mine. I am merely outlining why the stories fail to convince. If this story was 'Feeding the Five' or 'Jesus Walked Down a Street' it would be entirely reasonable for you to demand proof the accounts were falsified, but under the circumstances it is you who is making the leap of faith.\n \n \nAnd even if they did sit around after Christ's resurrection and reminisce on their shared experiences, and reduce that to writing\n\n \n I'm glad to see you accept that the three accounts do not constitute independent corroboration.\n \n \nRecommend you read \"The Historical Jesus,\" by Gary Habermas (and the \"Case for Christ,\" by Lee Stroebel) so you can discern between the preponderance of the evidence for the historical Christ and Santa Clause fairy tales.\n\n \n Recommend you read my last post, by me, so you can distinguish between evidence for the existence of a man and evidence of the existence of a deity. I did not compare Santa with Jesus.\n \n \nDoes that mean we should trash all our history books because they all had some kind of an \"agenda\"?\n\n \n Have I asked you to trash the bible? I think you'll find not. I have successfully contended that it may not be entirely the word of god, and I am casting doubt upon the literal truth of one of its stories. Why do you keep trying to turn this into an all-or-nothing assault on your religion?\n \n Additionally, you repeatedly fail to make a vital distinction: the part of the bible under discussion is not a history book. An academic history book may advance a hypothesis (an 'agenda' as it were) but a good one does so by sourcing its data, critically analysing its likely truthfulness and objectivity, and corroborating details with independent sources. If it fails to do that, any outlandish claims it makes would be viewed with suspicion. \n \n FTFT on the other hand is the raw material that a history book would analyse. It is a personal account by three men whose avowed intent was to convince the reader that the teachings of Jesus had more than mortal weight behind them. The event they describe is fanciful, inexplicably vague, inconsistent with human nature and uncorroborated by any independent source. What would you expect an impartial historian to conclude?\n \n \nI know, which is why I now prefer you actually dig up some facts. People can hypothesize ad nauseum and never get anywhere. <snip< You really need to provide some kind of evidence, outside of personal prejudice or well-intentioned arguments if you are going to succeed at making a case for anything. For example, if you think the Gospel writers were wrong on a geographical or historical issue,\n\n \n So if I understand you correctly, something contradicted by words in other historical accounts is questionable, but something that is contradicted by every principle of physics we can discern - and alleged to have occurred in a manner that flies in the face of human nature - is by default true? According to you, the only acceptable evidence for a physical impossibility having not occurred is the written testimony of someone there saying it didn't?\n \n No question there is personal prejudice at work here.",

Historical accounts , no.\n\n \n Nuts. \"Never saw anything?\" \n \n Eyewitness Accounts and Testimony\n \n Luke 24:30 - When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. 31 Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. 32 They asked each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\" \n 33 They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 34 and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\" 35 Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. \n \n Luke 24:36 - While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\" 37 They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. 38 He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? 39 Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" \n \n John 20:16 - Jesus said to her, \"Mary.\" She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, \"Rabboni!\" (which means Teacher). 17 Jesus said, \"Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' \" 18 Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: \"I have seen the Lord!\" And she told them that he had said these things to her. \n \n John 20:19 - On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" 20 After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. \n \n John 20:26 - A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" 27 Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\" \n 28 Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\" \n \n 1 Corinthians 15:3 - For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. 6 After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, 8 and last of all he appeared to me also... \n \n Acts 1:1 - In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach 2 until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. 3 After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. 4 On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. \n \n 1 John 4:14 - And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. \n \n 2 Peter 1:16 - We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\n \n Luke 1:1 - Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3 Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. \n \n Matthew 28:5 - The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. 7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.\" 8 So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 Suddenly Jesus met them. \"Greetings,\" he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.",
