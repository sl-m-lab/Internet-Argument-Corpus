   "It is claimed that conservatism has no foundational document (The Kirk Center - Ten Conservative Principles by Russell Kirk). Conservatism supposedly has no Das Kapital or a Mein Kampf from which it can draw its meaning and purpose. Conservatism is alleged to be without ideology or dogma. Instead conservatism is supposed to be based on what leading conservative thinkers and writers throughout history have said it means.\n \n But this puts conservatism in the position of being dependent on principles that were formulated by people that are identified as conservatives without having any hard and fast criteria that can be used to identify conservatives in the first place. If we define conservatism by what leading conservatives want, we must identify leading conservatives without knowing what conservatism means. This gives politicians, the news media and the internet population at large carte blanche to define conservatism as it suits them. Conservatism can be lauded or lambasted at the merest whim. People can make conservatism up as they go along. Conservatism has, therefore, become the depository for everything that liberals dislike and the refuge for every libertarian who is really a scoundrel at heat.\n \n But conservatism is based on certain core ideological beliefs. Conservative ideology is universal; it is not dependent on the conservative's day and age; on his race, gender or religion; on his social class, nationality or his form of government. Conservatism is not based simply on what people that we today choose to identify as conservatives wanted in the past. Conservatism is not something ephemeral that can be made up to suit somebody's political purpose or private agenda. There are certain things- certain ideologies- that naturally make a conservative a conservative. Conservatives have a natural longing for stability while liberals, and their libertarian brethren, are perfectly happy with chaos. The purpose of conservatism is to establish and maintain a stable, functional and self-sustaining society. Conservatism's purpose and the conservative's longing for stability give conservatism certain inherent ideological components.\n \n American conservatism has nothing to do with the American Revolution, the U.S. Constitution or the Founding Fathers. Conservatism transcends these things. Your views on the proper purpose, size or scope of government does not determine whether or not you are a conservative. Your acceptance of certain core ideological axioms makes you a conservative.\n \n I. Social contract\n Each generation is indebted to the ones that came before it and is obligated to the ones that come after it.\n A. Tradition\n Society is based upon and must uphold tradition to the extent that tradition stabilizes society.\n B. Environmental conservation\n 1. Individuals must be willing to forgo maximum immediate profit for the sake of long-term sustainability. No generation is entitled to exhaust whatever natural resources it may have inherited from its forefathers.\n 2. Extract the greatest material benefit from the resources that are used by using resources in the most efficient manner.\n C. Economic stability\n 1. Favor sound monetary policy to stabilize market prices and discourage speculation that can create market bubbles that will inevitably burst causing societal upheaval.\n 2. Avoid excessive debt that can hamper the ability of future generations to deal with whatever socio-economic and national security problems that may arise.\n II. Interrelationship between property and liberty\n A. Stabilizing influence of property\n 1. Societal upheaval can put the property at risk. \n 2. A property owner is more likely to respect the property of others in order to insure that others respect his own property.\n B. Property rights\n 1. Individuals must be able to acquire property. \n 2. Individuals must be able to sell property.\n 3. Property rights cannot be absolute. Society has a right to regulate property rights so no one can infringe on the property rights of others by exercising an absolute right of his own.\n III. Interrelationship between property and power\n A. Wealth equals power\n 1. Wealth must be regulated as power is regulated.\n (a) Regulate the wealthy so they cannot oppress the poor with their power.\n (1) Guaranteed human rights for all individual regardless of wealth.\n (2) Guaranteed broad but otherwise limited civil rights coupled with an upwardly mobile society that offers the chance of acquiring civil rights in the future (by coming of age or acquiring property for example).\n (3) Impose taxes that allow private property to be used for public benefit since people who enjoy society's protection for their property have a moral obligation to sustain society.\n (4) Oppose laissez-faire economics since unregulated capitalistic markets concentrate wealth (and poverty) because the profit motive exacerbates human nature and allows individuals to sack, maim, pillage and destroy; lie, steal, cheat and kill for the sake of profit.\n (b) Regulate the poor so they cannot oppress the wealthy with their numbers.\n (1) Oppose democratic societies in favor of republican/royal government where the will of a momentary majority does not automatically determine government policy. \n (2) Oppose progressive taxation and income re-distribution schemes as immoral; taxes can be used as a regulatory tool, but no one should be obligated to pay more taxes simply because they can afford to do so.\n IV. Importance of society/government as a means to protect inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, i.e., property.\n A. The individual and society exist in partnership with each being dependent on the other.\n 1. Participating in society is not voluntary because society is necessary to impose order on individual humans that are by nature orderless.\n (a) Society has a right to impose its will on the individual and thereby maintain law and order while upholding traditions in order to stabilize society.\n (b) Nobody has a right to rebel against a legitimate government and all lawful means of redress must be exhausted before force can be used against an illegitimate government meaning that a majority can impose its will on a minority so that being in the minority does not gain you any rights or privileges that are inconsistent with public order and society's preservation.\n 2. Society has an obligation to protect its constituent parts against the individual actions of its constituent parts.\n (a) Nobody has a right to engage in behavior that puts society, i.e., other people, at risk regardless of whether or not the individual believes his behavior is victimless.\n (b) Government has a right to use force against the governed in order to maintain its own sovereignty meaning that government can regulate access to the means by which the governed can use force.\n 3. Individuals may act outside of the confines of society and may use deadly force if necessary whenever society cannot take timely action to protect life or property from criminal behavior.\n B. Society is a living organism.\n 1. The more varied the constituent parts of society are the more buffered the society is meaning a greater variety of constituent parts gives society a greater stability.\n (a) Society must recognize the divergent natural abilities (such as physical strength and intelligence) of its constituent parts and understand that these divergent natural abilities will lead to inequality that society must more-or-less accept.\n (b) Society must try to even out gross socio-economic inequality that could lead to societal disruption (conservatives are opposed to the mass concentration of both wealth and poverty), but society cannot wantonly expend its resources in an endless effort to achieve equality among its constituent parts.\n (c) Society has the right to impose a certain amount of conformity on individuals for the sake of insuring societal cohesion between its constituent parts.\n 2. Society must uphold human rights to life, liberty and property consistent with public order and the insurance of society's future.\n C. Government\n 1. Society is greater than the sum of its constituent parts.\n (a) Collective action by society serves a needful purpose by promoting the commonwealth of society.\n (b) Government must have the power to do whatever needs to be done to promote the commonwealth of society whenever the constituent parts of society cannot or will not take action.\n 2. Government is a reflection of the governed \n (a) Individuals must not become dependent on their government for their daily sustenance lest the government assume undue power unto itself.\n (b) Government's powers must be divided into separate but mutually dependent departments so no part of the government can assume undue power unto itself.\n (c) The government must be answerable to the governed lest it abuse the governed.\n (d) The government must be responsive to the governed lest the governed rebel against the government because it cannot meet the needs of the governed.\n V. Self-evident truths of human nature\n A. Humans are by nature self-serving, self-centered and greedy brutes as evidenced by the whole of human history.\n B. Human nature is not alterable by natural means; putting others ahead of one's self is the antithesis of human nature and no individual, when left to his own devices, will ever do it.\n 1. Human society is inevitable; otherwise human beings will destroy each other because they cannot live peaceably in a state of nature.\n 2. All human society can do is compensate for human nature by imposing its will on the individual so as to prevent the individual from harming others or harming himself in a way that drains society's resources.\n C. Faith or religion may be able to overcome human nature in that an individual may be prompted to give consideration to others for the sake of faith or religion.\n 1. Society cannot legitimately impose its will on the individual in matters of faith or religion but personal conscience does not automatically give an individual a right to separate himself from society or shirk his obligation to maintain society.\n 2. Society has an obligation to allow and even encourage faith and religion consistent with public order; nobody should have to forfeit his faith/religion for the sake of gaining human or civil rights or forfeit his human or civil rights for the sake of peacefully practicing his faith/religion. \n VI. Human biology is unalterable by any natural means\n A. Biology makes men and women distinct from each other with natural strengths and weaknesses; a man cannot naturally be a woman, nor can a woman naturally be a man.\n 1. Men and women are mutually dependent on each other due to their respective biological functions. \n 2. Society must uphold and maintain the distinction of men and woman for the sake of its own survival.\n VII. Society driven by human nature cannot be perfect because human nature is not perfect\n A. Change is inevitable\n 1. Human societies are always subject to the forces of the natural environment that can wreak wholesale changes to society that society is powerless to stop.\n 2. Societal inertia naturally leads to conflict\n (a) People that have comfortable lives naturally want to preserve the status quo.\n (b) People who feel themselves oppressed will naturally seek to better their situation.\n B. Each generation has a moral obligation to confront the shortcomings of the generations that came before it so as to not perpetuate these shortcomings on posterity and thereby allow the failures of past generations to accumulate and put society at risk; no generation is so great that its posterity is obligated to maintain its failures.\n C. Change for the mere sake of change is folly\n 1. All change, regardless of how necessary it may be, must be weighed against the long-term disruptive effects it may have on society; change is not automatically change for the better.\n 2. A perfect society is impossible due to the imperfection of human nature so it is pointless to constantly strive for utopia- something that can never exist; furthermore the desire for perfection leads invariably to a desire for change for the sake of change and this puts society at grave risk.\n 3. It is better to accept society as it is and wait for change to come in the natural course of events than it is to risk society's total destruction caused by immediate change whose long-term consequences cannot be anticipated.\n D. Restorative change\n 1. Experience shows what has worked well in the past. \n 2. Society should always encourage restorative change.",

   "If this is not ideology, then what, pray tell (no pun intended) is ?\n\n \n Have I said that Kirk didn't have an ideology? He does, but its more libertarian than it is conservative.\n \n \n2.An affection for the \"variety and mystery\" of human existence;\n 3.A conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize \"natural\" distinctions;\n\n \n Humans don't all have the same physical or intellectual ability, but I get the impression that Kirk used social Darwinism to justify letting the haves oppress the have-nots. This is a recipe for revolution- which no legitimate conservative would want. My view of conservatism is based more on Edmund Burke and Otto von Bismark.\n \n \n4.A belief that property and freedom are closely linked;\n\n \n Only to the extent that both are regulated by society/government because property = power and power is always a tool of potential oppression and oppression always poses the risk revolution. Without the regulatory modification, Kirk's view of property is the libertarian, not the conservative view.\n \n \n5.A faith in custom, convention, and prescription,\n\n \n Again, only as long as they stabilize rather destabilize society. Slavery was once a custom in America, but that custom ultimately destabilized America and brought revolution upon the South.",

Your plan will keep them in that position. Mine allows them to vote for improvements. \n Theft is the end result of frustrated people not being able to legally obtain what they want or need. Alcoholism, drug addiction, is what happens when people can't handle the truth that they will never be allowed to possess what they want or need...an escape from reality.\n On one side of the coin you have people like Richard Branson making toys for the elite who vacation in Abu Dhabi and on the other side there are the rest of us.

Life is not always fair but, it shouldn't be this unfair.\n It seems to be your opinion that those poor ignorant fools living in Africa were born that way and they do not have the natural potential to become anything better.

You can't call those who have nothing greedy or, lustful. Envy is wanting what another possesses. Poor people just want their own. Spite? You mean as in biting the hand that feeds it? Allow people to feed themselves.\n \nAnd considering the Sexual Revolution that you liberals/libertarians pushed on America, where are all of these families you say men naturally want to look out for?\n Some are broken some are hanging on by a thread.

Don't pass the exam and you repeat the grade/subject.\n \n We need national standards for teacher qualifications and education and no teachers' unions.\n \n And we need to create schools where the parents/guardians of the students enrolled act as a board of directors to oversee the hiring and firing of school staff and the setting of school standards in regards to things like sex-ed and religious observances.

Every other household with children in my neighborhood was on welfare. So yea, some people are poor and uneducated because they want to be.\n \n Let me reiterate the warning of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Leuchtenburg, page 124: the welfare dole is \"a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit...I am not willing that the vitality of our people be further sapped by the giving of cash, of market baskets, of a few hours of weekly work cutting grass, raking leaves or picking up papers in public parks. The Federal Government must and shall quit this business of relief\".\n \n Sadly this country has not only failed to heed FDR's warning about human nature, we no longer make any real effort to make people accept menial government make-work jobs in order to get their welfare checks.",
