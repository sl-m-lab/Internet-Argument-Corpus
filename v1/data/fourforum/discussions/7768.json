Bulemics are typically over-achievers with control issues, poor self esteem, but don't necessarily have a distorted body-image and they certainly aren't suicidal. In Terri's case, she did have a distorted body image, but that doesn't translate into wanting to die. \n If you'd like to know more, PM me.",
