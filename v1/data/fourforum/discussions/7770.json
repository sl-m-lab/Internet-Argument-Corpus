How sweet. We're truly out of control. \n \n In partial answer to your question, in private industry the purpose of depreciating assets is to build a reserve point for replacement. If the asset is depreciated and sold, a gain on sale must be declared to recapture a portion of the depreciation. Depreciate that M16 to zero, sell it and pay taxes on the gain as other income. \n \n For government, weaponry is devalued purely to maintain budget request levels. Theoretically, you could replace the first year devaluation of M16s with new M16s to bring inventory up to snuff. All sorts of game playing is encouraged. Contribute those crummy M16s to the Philippine quest for democracy through despotic dictatorship and declare an inventory reduction in long arm, personal, for budget supplement replacement to crummy M4s. At new cost, of course.",

The hard thing with the financial statements posted is that they are consolidated among many different agencies which have their own and are audited by different companies. I believe Kearney and Company do a lot of it..as an example.\n \n Your concept of Fund accounting being an \"embezzlers\" dreams is rather...stupid...I guess. The control structure is probably the main thing to look at. In fact, depreciation in a lot of government agencies is not even recorded or done until statement time when the conversion to accural is done.\n \n You can be obsessed with accural accounting when judging governmental...they are two different animals. I honestly think accural is subject to more manipulation than fund or cash accounting, but at the same time fund and cash don't reflect continuing activity as well (a goal not needed in government).\n \n \n \n \n EDIT: I am reading the federal governments wonderful financial statements here...this seemed interesting to me ( I remind you I don't do federal government accounting just state, local, and nonprofit)\n \n\n The federal government generally uses accrual accounting to record and report financial\n information contained in its financial statements...The federal government primarily uses the cash\n basis of accounting for its budget, which is the federal government's primary financial planning\n and control tool. \n\n \n I am not all certain that all the agencies use an accrual accounting method over a modified accrual (not cash). They then go on to talk about how they do use modified accrual for alot of things...who on earth writes these things?\n \n Moreover, the statements are not posted in your normal way so are they really using FASB at all :p. So then you get to the notes of the financial statements and learn that in fact they decided to actually use their own standards SFFAS (which is why I was confused when they said FASB earlier). SFFAS is not even really accrual based. It is modified accrual...a good example is to look at uncollectable accounts.\n \n I guess maybe you guys do have reason to be concerned with these messed up statements...this is why I stick with state :) Nevertheless, they are approved by auditors so they have some backing I suppose.",

Auditors for 4 of the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies issued disclaimers of opinion on their agencies' fiscal year 2005 financial statements.2 These agencies represent about $848 billion, or 58 percent, of the federal government's reported total assets as of September 30, 2005, and pproximately $751 billion, or 25 percent, of the federal government's reported net cost for fiscal year 2005. Furthermore, several CFO Act agencies had to restate certain of their fiscal year 2004 financial statements.\n\n \n Translation: Not only are we not willing to certify this as being accurate, 4 of the auditors, representing 58% of the total reported assets, were not willing to certify their portions as being accurate.\n \n Several agencies still don't have their #### together enough to have LAST YEARS reports right.\n \n \n \nThe federal government did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting (including safeguarding assets) and compliance with significant laws and regulations as of September 30, 2005.\n\n \n translation: The people running this circus are a bunch of XXXXXX. Even THEY don't know where the hell all their moneys going.\n \n \nOur work to determine compliance with selected provisions of significant laws and regulations in fiscal year 2005 was limited by the material weaknesses discussed in our report.\n\n \n Translation: The auditors are XXXXXX, too. What are we paying these XXXXXX for?\n \n It seems apparent given the GAOs statements that either the audits are not being done, or the auditors are not doing their jobs. \n \n then they say some scary things:\n \n \n&#65279;More troubling still, the federal government's financial condition and long-term fiscal outlook is continuing to deteriorate. While the fiscal year 2005 budget deficit was lower than 2004, it was still very high, especially given the impending retirement of the \"baby boom\" generation and rising health care costs. Importantly, the federal government's accrual based net operating cost increased to $760 billion in fiscal year 2005 from $616 billion in fiscal year 2004. GAO's fiscal policy simulations illustrate that without significant changes on the spending and revenue sides of the budget, long-term deficits will encumber a growing share of federal resources and test the capacity of current and future generations to afford both today's and tomorrow's commitments. \n \n \n then some horrifying things:\n \n \nThe current financial reporting model does not clearly and transparently show the wide range of responsibilities, programs, and activities that may either obligate the federal government to future spending or create an expectation for such spending. Thus, it provides a potentially unrealistic and misleading picture of the federal government's overall performance, financial condition, and future fiscal outlook. The federal government's gross debt3 in the consolidated financial statements was about $8 trillion as of September 30, 2005. This number excludes such items as the gap between the present value of future promised and funded Social Security and Medicare benefits, veterans' health care, and a range of other liabilities (e.g., federal employee and veteran benefits payable), commitments, and contingencies that the federal government has pledged to support. Including these items, the federal government's fiscal exposures now total more than $46 trillion, up from about $20 trillion in 2000. This translates into a burden of about $156,000 per American or approximately $375,000 per full-time worker, up from $72,000 and $165,000 respectively, in 2000. These amounts do not include future costs resulting from Hurricane Katrina or the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Continuing on this unsustainable path will gradually erode, if not suddenly damage, our economy, our standard of living, and ultimately our national security.\n\n \n Yep, you read that right. Up $26 trillion in the alst 5 yrs...5.2 trillion per year!!!\n \n \n If you read the last portion of the report, \"Governmetn accountibility Office Report\" (direct link http://www.fms.treas.gov/fr/05frusg/05gao2.pdf) says that in 19 out of 24 agencies, the auditors who reported found they were not meeting their responsibilities.",

   "I do see that point...but don't blame the auditors for that. They are doing what they are paid to do. The ones failing here are the government agencies. If GM fails an audit 5 years in a row, it isn't KPMGs(assuming thats who does the audit) fault.\n \n The biggest flaw is clearly the internal controls. Until they fix that, the auditors are going to have to keep on reporting that the numbers are bogus.\n\n \n This is where the confusion lies, at least for me. When I send somebody in to do an audit, i don't just want to hear \"right or wrong\". I want to know wht it is worng, and see a corrected verision. That is what auditors are for, they are #######s who go in and ferrret out everybodies dirty littel secrets. \n \n Apparently this is not the case for governmetn entities, unless it is the IRS, in which case they ferret out your secrets.",

Following outdated, often broken P&P to the letter ensures well-compensated and benefited job security on the employee side and fat margins for contractors. If a government audit shows financial chaos year after year, oh well, public opinion isn't going to change anything because 95% of them don't have a clue as to what's going on, just keep taking the money and ask for more.",

As I stated, why bother with audits? Just give them checkbooks. There's obviously no internal controls or political desire to implement same.\n\n \n They did give opinions..the GAO is the one that didn't give an opinion (which I assume is procedure). \n \n Look at the DoE for example...here is part of the auditors opinion\n \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the U.S. Department of Education (the Department) as of September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of net cost, changes in net position, and financing and the combined statements of\n budgetary resources for the fiscal years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Department's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.\n (emphasis added)\n This opinion was actually an unqualified opinion...every department has one of these. The GAO may do things differently...who knows, but the actual auditors or the departments expressed opinions. I wouldn't let PWC off so easy either...they do audits for the government as well.\n \n So I am not sure what you are saying? All I can see is that you are mad because the GAO decided to not give an opinion (they aren't an auditing firm by the way...they just represent an \"audit\" for the financial statements as a whole). \n \n For the record:\n DoD = Disclaimer of opinion\n DoE = Unqualified opinion\n I can give more if I find them\n \n \nThis is where the confusion lies, at least for me.

That is what auditors are for, they are #######s who go in and ferrret out everybodies dirty littel secrets.\n An auditor is not allowed to correct things for a company. You can offer corrections or state what is wrong, but this 1) isn't stated in an opinion normally and 2) the corrections are done by the company. For an auditor to just do the corrections, destroys the independence of the auditor. There are actually standards for these things you know. It also makes the auditing firm libel if there are mistatements.",
