And in that instance I was referring to the BNP and their links to the violent organisation Combat 18.

What is likely to lead to accusations of racism or fascism is when opponents of immigration discriminate between white and non-white in which immigrants they disapprove of, and when they use xenophobia (fear of the alien) to support their views, as seen in much of the press with scare stories about immigrants and asylum seekers. The hatred directed at immigrants by the Daily Mail, Daily Express and Sun, is reminiscent of the attitudes fostered by Nazi propaganda about Jews. It is the classic building of an internal and external enemy on which to place the blame for domestic problems (health service, education, housing).

I've not seen any conservatives who aren't to some degree capitalist.\n\n \n On what grounds do you base this? In point of fact, 3rd world countries usually end up on the upswing and things start improving when business and capitalism become more prevalent there. I've seen it myself. The reality is that there are less problems in a country if the country's economy is booming or even healthy than if the economy is dead. It's not that complicated, really. And I also want to point out here that the ones who tend to give the most to the needy are capitalists--Warren Buffet and Bill Gates come to mind, and there are many more. They've literally given many billions to the needy (each), more than many non-capitalist countries have been willing to give.\n \n Furthermore, if not capitalism, what other system would there be? Unless a country is completely communist, it contains capitalism to some degree. There is no way around it. Your statement is like saying \"people trading things is behind most of the world's problems.\" To not have any capitalism whatsoever would essentially mean no monetary transactions whatsoever between private citizens, relying instead on other means than money--which more than likely means communism. Capitalism doesn't necessarily mean 'the love of money.' It is a necessary way of doing things in a world that isn't communist. And even in communist countries, there is usually SOME degree of capitalism going on, even if unofficially. People trade things. It's part of human life. Some capitalists are greedy and have a love of money, but some don't. Again, you are generalizing.
