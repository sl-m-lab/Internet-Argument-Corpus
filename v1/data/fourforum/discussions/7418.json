   "I voted that I would break the law in the first and third instances. But on reflection, I would also break it in the third.\n \n 1 - If (hypothetically) I felt I needed an abortion, I would take steps to have one, regardless of the legality of the act. Having an abortion should never be a decision taken lightly, and frankly I couldn't care less what other people think about. If I feel I need one, I will have one.\n \n 2 - I think the government does tax us too heavily. In return, I make no effort to declare cash-in-hand earnings, and with hold information pertaining to my finances that could result in me paying a higher amount of tax.\n \n 3 - One the one hand, many people don't set out to drink drive. At some stage during the night, they decide (usually drunk at the time) to drive home. While I have never, and never plan to drink and drive, if I did feel like it was the best thing for me, it's what I would do. Especially if I was to make the decision while intoxicated.",

   "1 i could never see myself being desperate enough to take anothers life.\n\n \n The question assumes motivation, assumes that you would get an abortion if it were legal. To then claim you could never be motivated to have an abortion is ignoring the point of the question, which is would it make a difference to you if it were legal or not. Like my answer to the drink driving question. I can't see myself ever thinking it would be a good idea, but if I did think it was a good idea, the legality of the act wouldn't be an issue I'd consider.\n \n \n2 the tax comes back to your country in one way or another.\n\n \n To give you an example, my own state government is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on sporting venues to cater for the upcoming commonwelath games next month. At the same time, state funded nursing homes are wildly short of both beds and staff, public hospitals still need more beds, the police need more numbers, in short, the money could be better spent on long term investments for the community instead of on short term bonuses to help get the current administration re-elected.\n \n Added to that, several members of parliament have spent tens of thousands of tax dollars on things like new curtains for the office, new wine racks for their homes, new cars, travel junkets, the list goes on.\n \n I do not trust the government to spend my money wisely. Not at all.\n \n \n3 i could never risk anothers life by driving whilst intoxicated\n\n \n Again, the question isn't really about whether you would drink and drive, but if you were going to do it, would it matter if it was legal or not?",

I'd say no to that.\n \n I don't want it to mean that.

For example, Marijuana; some people think is harmless but they don't want to do because it is against the law...so they won't do it.

Pregnancy is pretty huge, more so than some realize, and assuming the risk of being caught if you end your pregnancy is a level of risk I am willing to bet a great plenty of women will assume.

I mean it like someone realizing that abortion is illegal but the opportunity has come up...would the law stop you from doing it if nothing else did?\n\n \n No. As I suggested in may previous example on tax, there are cases where the law is unjust and unworthy of repect.

No taxi's available? I walk home. Too far to walk? I'll sleep it off in my car and drive home the following day. Does the law dictate my actions? in part off course (I don't want a hefty fine/prison sentence/loss of driving licence), but it is mainly the reason on which that law is founded that makes me adhere to it (killing/severely injuring someone as a result of driving when unfit to do so).",
