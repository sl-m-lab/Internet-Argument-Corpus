Isn't that special? That was sarcasm, for anyone who didn't pick up on that. Spiderman is the best!!",

Batman is smart, fast, and strong....all naturally where as some dork got bit by a spider and could all of a sudden jump all over the place...whoopie......\n \n Batman Forever... :)\n\n \n Where do you get the idea that Peter Parker is a dork? If you received that notation from the movie then you are not worthy to post such a post. Spiderman's fate was sealed when he was bitten by that spider, which means he will forever be Spiderman. Unlike Mister Batman, who -although doesn't directly buy his weapons- buys the material to make them, when Spiderman's powers are forever his. If Batman loses his utility belt, he becomes a bat with out its wings... fangs... or even sonar!\n \n I would rather rely on a super hero with ACTUAL SUPER powers, rather than a guy who needs a bat signal to tell him if there is danger.",
