   "First off, I really like that you provided your sources.\n \n Second, I disagree completely. Here's why.\n \n There have been alot of claims that Iraq had no WMDs after 1991. True, there is no concrete evidence of WMDs found. However, use some logic here. He did use them in the 80's against Iran. Does anyone dispute that? He used them against the Kurds in his own country. Does anyone dispute that? Then, throughout the 90's, he denied weapons inspectors access to sensitive sites where they were supposedly kept. Why would he do this unless he ahd something to hide? And after he used these weapons against his enemies, do you really think he just threw them all away? Come on, think about it. As for the nuclear program, 2 points. 1) You are not privy to the kinds of intelligence that the president is, and this is most definately sensitive information. He couldn't reveal evidence of how any of that was found out, and neither could the CIA. 2) Do you really think there is any chance that Saddam was not trying to obtain one?\n \n As for finding them, Bush said that they had found laboratories used to build them, and in fact, they have. In late 2003, maybe mid, troops of the 101st Airborne Division did come across a stockpile of chemical and biological agents. I don't remember exactly what substance it was, but I believe it was mostly ricin. Have they found the huge nuclear missiles that you people are looking for? No, they haven't, but we haven't exactly come up empty handed either. We have found WMDs.\n \n Economics. Yes, we no longer have a surplus, and we do have a deficit. That's kinda what happens when you're trying to pull a country out of a recession, you're pumping money into security, you create a new cabinet position, and then, oh yeah, you wage two military operations. Understand, this stuff takes money. Would you rather we sell back all of our metal detectors, surveillance funding, stuff like that, to put money back into a surplus? Honestly, I'd rather that money be used to keep my family and yours safe.\n \n His tax cuts are not just for the wealthy. The wealthy have been taxed greater proportionally than any other economic group in the country. That's not right, being rich isn't a crime. But the whole business about these tax cuts not helping American families? That's bull. My family is typical middle class, 2 parents and 2 children, both parents work full time. Bush's tax cuts actually helped us out alot.\n \n Ya know, so far I'm really liking this forum. Being able to debate about this stuff and throw points back and forth is wonderful, that's what America is about.",

But, those are excuses....not explanations. If you honestly believe things are good and Bush , compared to just 4 years ago, has made the world a better place...I have to be honest....that's delusional.\n \n I'm encouraged that you enjoy the debate. I hope alot of people talk about their differences rather than go to war over them. It's a positive approach. \n You sound like a good guy. I suggest you go out there and look for the facts from all angles. don't trust the government, or CNN, and find it yourself. And when i say don't trust the government, I don't mean that in a partisan way. They're all screwed up.( truth be told, that;s an exageration. we have some public servants that aren't subserviant to special interests. I just wish i knew which ones.)",

   "First question is kinda OT; how do I quote people in my posts?\n \n You do have a point about Arab psychology and bowing to outsiders. I don't think that is all that probable, but i do think it's possible enough to be considered.\n \n I'm sorry, but I don't think things like anthrax and ricin are used to pasteurize milk.\n \n True, we have not seen much solid, 'smoking gun' evidence of WMDs, nor do I think there are good chances that we will. I do, however, believe that they existed very recently. Simple logic adds credence to that.\n \n The 'all Clinton's' fault card. Now, I'm a very strong anti-Clinton person, but I don't think you can lay all the economic problems at his feet.

I was wrong, it wasn't the 101st.\n \n \"For example, the U.S. Army's 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry investigated a site at Baiji, north of Baghdad. They said they had detected nerve and blister agents in 55-gallon drums.\"\n \n That's a direct quote from cnn.com in an article dated May 2, 2003.\n \n \n \n \nthe world wasn't neccesarily better....buyt....look at the middle east right now? \n\n \n The Middle East to me looks really :xcensored -p right now...just like when Clinton was in power. The Israeli-Palestinian situation hasn't changed all that much, and that is the primary conflict there.\n \n \nlook at the economy. \n\n \n You cannot possibly tell me that the fact you think we had a better economy 4 years ago means that the world was better? And besides, the economy right now is doing quite well, it's recovering. That's by no means entirely thanks to George Bush, but to be fair, he did have a minor hand to play in that rebound.\n \n \nlook at the way europe sees america now. you might want to do a search on this...\"why europe admires america\" you'll be hard pressed to find a positive link. \n\n \n I really don't think that the opinion of the French and Germans on the United States is an indicator of whether this is a better world or not. They follow a path of appeasement, and because we don't, they have a negative view of America. \n \n \nwas clinton a better President? Fudge yeah. he got A bj. THAT DIDN'T COST PEOPLE LIVES.\n\n \n Well, you have a point. Clinton getting a bj in the Oval Office did not cost lives. However, how about his actions in Somalia in 1993? Do you remember those? Task Force Ranger was sent to Somalia to capture Mohammad Farrah Aidid and his lieutenants. The commander of the task force requested from the White house additional armor support in the form of Bradley IFVs and close air support in the form of AC-130 Spectre gunships. Clinton denied both of these requests every time they were made. In the street battle on October 3-4 1993, 18 American soldiers were killed, and the primary reasons the death count was so high was because they had humvees for transportation, not IFVs like they wanted. They had UH-60s and AH-6s for air support, but both of these are vastly inferior to 130s. Most of the casualties were from soldiers inside vehicles getting shot by small arms and rpgs, and helicopters being shot down by rpgs.\n \n That did cost lives. Read the book Black Hawk Down. Besides being a wonderful book and an excellent look at the courage of American soldiers in combat, it details this much more thoroughly.\n \n Clinton was not a better president. Because of his foreign policies, al-Qaeda was able to grow and plan and operate freely. Because of his foreign policy, America was viewed as a paper tiger. People thought they could attack the US and not suffer a punishing counter attack. For 8 years, they were right, and good 'ol Bill saw to that. Don't even point to the fact that the economy was in a better shape then or that there was a surplus, neither one of those is an effective argument. The economy is recovering from a recession that began during Clinton's administration and was further compounded by terrorist attacks and the responses to them.\n \n \nyeah...as far as differences of opinion....I think i'm progressive in that regard. I vote independant. i believe that people are going to believe what they want to believe. sometimes it's a matter of what they've experienced . What can i say? we're Americans right? You american . i'm american. You see alot of Liberals are this and the right is this....it's bull. We're Americans. We should work together.\n\n \n I agree that we should work together. I really do believe that the reason why this country works is that we have liberals on one side, conservatives on the other, and independents in between. There has to be middle-ground, compromise.\n \n And chaddygirl, I looked around that website you posted a link to. I have to be honest, if you read that and think that that is a credible source of information...then emoticon_wow. That's not unbiased reporting of facts, thats a completely biased anti-Bush hate site.\n \n Thank you, however, for the info about quoting.",

   "A War (At Any Cost) President \n \n \n Ehsan Ahrari, Ph.D., writes about security issues and international affairs from Alexandria, Virginia. \n \n \n Soon after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States, President George W. Bush created a litmus test for his presidency along the following line: that he should be judged as a \"war president\" in the global \"war on terrorism.\" He reminded the nation of that template on Feb. 8, in an hour-long interview on NBC's program \"Meet the Press,\" by referring to himself as a \"war president\" 31 times. Now his former chief counter-terrorism adviser, Richard Clarke, in a forthcoming book Against All Enemies, not only gives Bush a failing grade on his performance in that \"war,\" but, in a widely publicized interview on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday, accused him of neglecting to recognize the threat stemming from Al Qaeda after entering office. The most serious aspect of Clarke's accusation against the president is of \"manipulating America into war with Iraq with dangerous consequences.\" \n \n When it entered into office in January 2001, said Clarke, the entire focus of Bush's national security team was on working on old issues, such as Iraq and Star Wars and \"not on new issues, the new threats that developed over the preceding eight years.\" Clarke told CBS correspondent Leslie Stahl that Bush officials were \"tepid\" in their response, when, before 9/11, Clarke suggested holding a meeting to discuss threats stemming from Al Qaeda. \"Frankly,\" he added, \"I find it outrageous that the president is running for re-election on the grounds that he's done such great things about terrorism. He ignored it. He ignored terrorism for months, when maybe we could have done something to stop 9/11 ...\" Clarke observed. However, he added: \"There is a lot of blame to go around, and I probably deserve some blame.\" \n \n Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, the focus of Bush's national security team, instead of remaining focused on attacking Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, quickly turned to Iraq. Starting from the first National Security Council (NSC) meeting, top Bush officials wanted to punish Iraq. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was saying, according to Clarke, that the United States needed to bomb Iraq. Even when other participants of that meeting kept insisting that the focus should be on Al Qaeda and Afghanistan, Rumsfeld was saying there there were not any good targets in Afghanistan, and that there were many good targets in Iraq. Clarke said at first he that thought Rumsfeld's comment about the lack of good targets in Afghanistan was a joke. The administration wanted to believe, he told \"60 Minutes,\" that there was a connection between 9/11 and Iraq. \n \n The most damning part of Clarke's accusation is a reported conversation that he had with the president, in which Bush said: \"I want to find out whether Iraq did this.\" He goes on to clarify that Bush never asked him to make it up; however, he notes: \"... the entire conversation left me in absolutely no doubt that George Bush wanted me to come back with a report that said Iraq did this.\" When Clarke responded that U.S. intelligence had investigated that issue and found no connection, Bush \"came back at me and said, 'Iraq, Saddam', find out if there's a connection.\" Bush's tone, according to Clarke, was \"very intimidating.\" \n \n The White House reacted quickly to Clarke's charges. Late on Sunday, it offered a number of rebuttals, saying that Bush specifically told National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice that he was \"tired of swatting flies\" and wanted to go on the offense against Al Qaeda. \n \n In a statement, the White House said that officials met frequently between March and September 2001 to devise ways to deprive Al Qaeda of the support of Pakistan and the shelter provided by the Taliban. The statement said that the anti-Al Qaeda strategy was ready for implementation on Sept. 4, 2001. Since 16 of the 19 airliner hijackers were already in the country by June 2001, even neutralizing Al Qaeda leader bin Laden would not have halted their plans, the statement said. \n \n Clarke, the White House said, did not advocate any plan to take on Al Qaeda inside the United States and never made the Bush administration aware of security assessments made by the Bill Clinton administration about the possible use of airplanes as weapons. \n \n Clarke, meanwhile, on \"60 Minutes,\" continuing to describe a series of developments following the meeting with Bush, states that the U.S. intelligence team wrote a report and sent it to the NSC reiterating the lack of connection between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein's regime. It bounced back from there saying: \"Wrong answer ... do it again.\" Without implicating Bush in this particular insistence from the NSC, Clarke added: \"I don't think the people around the president show him memos like that. I don't think he sees memos that he doesn't -wouldn't-like the answer.\" \n \n Citing other evidence of how the top national security officials of the Bush administration had their minds made up from the very beginning about attacking Iraq, Clarke recalls a meeting with Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. When Clarke told him the U.S. government needed to deal with Al Qaeda, Wolfowitz said: \"No, no, no. We don't have to deal with Al Qaeda. Why are we talking about that little guy? We have to talk about Iraqi terrorism against the United States.\" \n \n Clarke's accusations are not entirely new. Former U.S. Treasury secretary Paul O'Neil has made similar charges in Ron Suskind's book, The Price of Loyalty, that Bush and his top advisers made up their minds about toppling Saddam in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, without paying heed to any evidence linking the two. Similarly, former United Nations chief weapons inspector Hans Blix, while promoting his own book, Disarming Iraq, is making rounds in the United States and the United Kingdom, arguing that both nations were not interested in finding out whether there were indeed weapons of mass destruction in Iraq prior to their invasion of that country. \n \n Whether this controversy will go away, or whether it will bring about regime change in the United States depends on what happens inside Iraq between now and Nov. 4, when presidential elections take place. In the meantime, the credibility of Bush and the United States appear to be eroding on a sustained basis. Clarke's latest accusations promise to provide Bush's critics with further firepower.",

   "\"The press is abuzz with reports that former Clinton staffers are set to testify before the September 11 commission next week that \"they repeatedly warned their Bush administration counterparts in late 2000 that Al Qaeda posed the worst security threat facing the nation - and how the new administration was slow to act.\" The Clinton officials expected to so testify include Sandy Berger, Madeline Albright and Richard Clarke.\n \n Where to begin: the mind boggles at such shamelessness. To state the obvious, in late 2000 the Clinton administration was STILL IN OFFICE. If there were steps that needed to be taken immediately to counter the al Qaeda threat, as they \"bluntly\" told President Bush's transition team, why didn't they take those steps themselves?\n \n More broadly, of course, the Clinton administration was in power for eight years, while al Qaeda grew, prospered, and repeatedly attacked American interests:\n \n *1993: Shot down US helicopters and killed US servicemen in Somalia\n *1994: Plotted to assassinate Pope John Paul II during his visit to Manila\n *1995: Plotted to kill President Clinton during a visit to the Philippines \n *1995: Plot to to bomb simultaneously, in midair, a dozen US trans-Pacific flights was discovered and thwarted at the last moment\n *1998: Conducted the bombings of the US Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, that killed at least 301 individuals and injured more than 5,000 others\n *1999: Attempt to carry out terrorist operations against US and Israeli tourists visiting Jordan for millennial celebrations was discovered just in time by Jordanian authorities\n *1999: In another millenium plot, bomber was caught en route to Los Angeles International Airport \n *2000: Bombed the USS Cole in the port of Aden, Yemen, killing 17 US Navy members, and injuring another 39\n \n So what, when they had the power to act effectively against al Qaeda, did these Clinton administration officials do? Little or nothing. Their most effective action was to bomb what turned out to be an aspirin factory in Sudan. They had the opportunity to kill Osama bin Laden, but decided not to do it because they were not sure their lawyers would approve.\n \n For these people to criticize the Bush administration's efforts to protect Americans against terrorism, long after their own ineptitute had allowed al Qaeda to grow bold and powerful, is contemptible.\n \n Of these Clintonite critics, the most important appears to be Richard Clarke. Clarke has written a book called Against All Enemies which will appear tomorrow--coincidentally, just in time for the 2004 election campaign. Clarke is being interviewed on 60 Minutes as I write this--a cozy corporate tie-in, as Viacom owns both CBS and the publisher of Clarke's book.\n \n Clarke's charges against the Bush administration have already been widely published. Like his former boss Sandy Berger, he decries the Bush administration's failure to heed his \"warnings\" while Clarke and his fellow Clintonites were still in power. And he claims that Bush ignored terrorism \"for months\"--unlike his former boss, Bill Clinton, who ignored it for years.\n \n But most of the attention flowing Clarke's way has centered on his claims about what happened when he was working inside the Bush administration after January 2001. Clarke was President Clinton's counter-terrorism coordinator; he was demoted by the Bush administration to director of cybersecurity. But before that demotion, he says that Bush's foreign policy advisers paid too much attention to Iraq. Then, after September 11, Clarke says that President Bush asked him to try to find out whether Iraq had been involved in the attack:\n \n Now he never said, \"Make it up.\" But the entire conversation left me in absolutely no doubt that George Bush wanted me to come back with a report that said, \"Iraq did this.'' He came back at me and said, \"Iraq! Saddam! Find out if there's a connection,\" and in a very intimidating way.\n Clarke seems to view this request as a manifestation of a weird obsession. But Clarke must know that Iraq was involved in the Islamofascists' 1993 attempt to destroy the World Trade Center. So it was hardly unreasonable for President Bush to want to know whether Saddam was behind the successful effort in 2001 as well.\n \n Assuming, of course, that the conversation ever took place. Stephen Hadley, Condoleezza Rice's deputy, says that: \"We cannot find evidence that this conversation between Mr. Clarke and the president ever occurred.\"\n \n More generally, Clarke accuses the administration of spoiling for a fight with Iraq and claims that Donald Rumsfeld, in particular, was talking about Iraq immediately after the September 11 attacks. This is exactly the same claim that was made by the rather pathetic Paul O'Neill. The most basic problem with this claim is that while the administration endorsed the act of Congress that made regime change in Iraq the policy of the United States, it didn't attack Iraq for a year and a half after September 11, and then only after Saddam had definitively thumbed his nose at a series of U.N. resolutions.\n \n So, Richard Clarke's criticism of President Bush comes down to this: before September 11, like everyone else in the United States (including Clarke), he did not make al Qaeda terrorism his number one priority. Everything else he says is self-serving nonsense.\n \n But let's pursue a little further the question, who exactly is Richard Clarke? What do we know about him?\n \n First, we know that before September 11, he was professionally committed to the idea that al Qaeda represented a new form of \"stateless terrorism\" that could never cooperate with a country like Iraq:\n \n Prior to 9/11, the dominant view within the IC was that al Qaida represented a new form of stateless terrorism. That was also the view promoted by the Clinton White House, above all terrorism czar, Richard Clarke. To acknowledge that Iraqi intelligence worked with al Qaida is tantamount to acknowledging that all these people made a tremendous blunder--and they are just not going to do it.\n We now know that this dogma was false, and Iraq did in fact support and collaborate with al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups. But there is no one as resistant to new information as a bureaucrat who has staked his career on a theory.\n \n Second, we know that Richard Clarke was very willing to justify pre-emptive attack, on the basis of imperfect intelligence, when the attacker was Bill Clinton:\n \n I would like to speak about a specific case that has been the object of some controversy in the last month -- the U.S. bombing of the chemical plant in Khartoum, Sudan. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger wrote an article for the op-ed page of today's Washington Times about that bombing, providing the clearest rationale to date for what the United States did. He asks the following questions: What if you were the president of the United States and you were told four facts based on reliable intelligence. The facts were: Usama bin Ladin had attacked the United States and blown up two of its embassies; he was seeking chemical weapons; he had invested in Sudan's military-industrial complex; and Sudan's military-industrial complex was making VX nerve gas at a chemical plant called al-Shifa? Sandy Berger asks: What would you have done? What would Congress and the American people have said to the president if the United States had not blown up the factory, knowing those four facts? \n Is it really a crazy idea that terrorists could get chemical or biological weapons?\n \n \n Well, no, it's anything but a crazy idea. But Clarke seems to have gotten a very different attitude toward that possibility once a Republican became President.\n \n Third, we know that Clarke bought into the now-discredited \"law enforcement\" approach to counter-terrorism: if people are making war on us, arrest them!\n \n Long before our embassies in Africa were attacked on August 7, 1998, the United States began implementing this presidential directive. Since the embassies were attacked, we have disrupted bin Ladin terrorist groups, or cells. Where possible and appropriate, the United States will bring the terrorists back to this country and put them on trial. That statement is not an empty promise.\n No, it wasn't an empty promise. Clinton's promise of due process for terrorists explains why bin Laden is alive today, along with many of his confederates.\n \n So it is not hard to see why Richard Clarke, a discredited and demoted bureaucrat, would be bitter toward President Bush and the members of his administration who have carried out a successful anti-terrorism campaign, far different from the one endorsed by Clarke and the Clinton administration.\n \n But is Clarke only a bitter ex-bureaucrat, or is there more to his attack on President Bush? Let's consider both Clarke's personal history and his current employment. Clarke now teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government; here is his Kennedy School bio, which notes that the capstone of his career in the State Department was his service as Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. \n \n Another professor at the Kennedy School is Rand Beers, who is evidently an old friend and colleague of Clarke's, as Beers' Kennedy School bio says that \"[d]uring most of his career he served in the State Department's Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs.\" \n \n So Clarke and Beers, old friends and colleagues, have continued their association at the Kennedy School. Indeed, they even teach a course together. And, by the most astonishing coincidence, their course relates directly to the subject matter of Clarke's attack on the Bush administration: \"Post-Cold War Security: Terrorism, Security, and Failed States\" is the name of the course. Here is its syllabus: \n \n Between them Rand Beers and Richard Clarke spent over 20 years in the White House on the National Security Council and over 60 years in national security departments and agencies. They helped to shape the transition from Cold War security issues to the challenges of terrorism, international crime, and failed states...Case studies will include Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Iraq, Colombia, and Afghanistan. Challenges of counter-terrorism and homeland security will also be addressed.\n Why do we find this particularly significant? Because Rand Beers' bio says:\n \n He resigned [his State Department position] in March 2003 and retired in April. He began work on John Kerry's Presidential campaign in May 2003 as National Security/Homeland Security Issue Coordinator.\n There you have it: Richard Clarke is a bitter, discredited bureaucrat who was an integral part of the Clinton administration's failed approach to terrorism, was demoted by President Bush, and is now an adjunct to John Kerry's presidential campaign.\n \n Thanks to the indefatigable Dafydd ab Hugh for noting the connections between Clarke and Beers.\"\n \n \n Source\n \n \n \n Makes a good point...",

I can appreciate Bush's concern that apparently Iraq had played a role in a previous failed attempt on WTC, but why keep on doggedly pursuing it when your counter-terrorism adviser has twice sent you information that nothing is there? Isn't that anxiousness to blame Iraq?\n \n Hans Blix may be promoting his book, but he has had first-hand experience of the Iraqi situation. You say that Saddam showed contempt for the UN Security Council Resolution, but Hans Blix made a statement as Chief UN Weapons Inspector that Iraq was giving them substantial co-operation, yet Bush dismissed this. It seems Bush had no desire whatsoever to allow Hans Blix to finish his job.\n Further proof of that fact is this. 100 Al-Samoud missiles were found in Iraq, which \"slightly\" exceeded the UN limits imposed on Iraq. Immediate destruction of these were called for, which though Iraq were not willing to do at first,(since it was an important part of their defence arsenal), they did destroy 75 of these 100 missiles. If this could be found by the UN Inspectors, no talk of them being incompetent can be entertained, and if Iraq did destroy 75 missiles before the war, you cannot say that Saddam totally disregarded the UN resolution.\n In fact, i'll go as far as to say that this was perhaps why Iraq fell without much resistance. US robbed them of an important weapon in their arsenal, hence reducing their potency in war.\n \n A much more pertinant question is this, why did USA go to war with Iraq, when the War on Al-qaeda was reaching a crucial phase. Can anyone explain to me why the US has solely focused on Iraq and not on flushing out al-qaeda as soon as possible? Proof of this is that though Iraq has been occupied, Saddam been captured, Al-Qaeda is still surviving, possibly still recruiting, and Osama bin-laden is still elusive!",

He's also an egomaniac. He freely admits his fault in this, which makes him appear modest and humble. He attracts a much larger following if he takes on fault, he knows this, and he uses it. How many people would believe him and really support him if he came out \"I knew all about al-Qaeda before this, i could have stopped this attack, these XXXXXX didn't listen to me, it's all their fault, I'm blameless.\"\n \n \nClarke has not said that Clinton's adminstration was better at tackling terrorism.

Isn't that anxiousness to blame Iraq?\n\n \n This is Clarke making assumptions based on tone of voice. This is so not credible it's funny. :p See? It's funny. Of course you'll look for links to Iraq, that's completely understandable and logical to do.\n \n \nHans Blix may be promoting his book, but he has had first-hand experience of the Iraqi situation. You say that Saddam showed contempt for the UN Security Council Resolution, but Hans Blix made a statement as Chief UN Weapons Inspector that Iraq was giving them substantial co-operation, yet Bush dismissed this. It seems Bush had no desire whatsoever to allow Hans Blix to finish his job.\n Further proof of that fact is this. 100 Al-Samoud missiles were found in Iraq, which \"slightly\" exceeded the UN limits imposed on Iraq. Immediate destruction of these were called for, which though Iraq were not willing to do at first,(since it was an important part of their defence arsenal), they did destroy 75 of these 100 missiles. If this could be found by the UN Inspectors, no talk of them being incompetent can be entertained, and if Iraq did destroy 75 missiles before the war, you cannot say that Saddam totally disregarded the UN resolution.\n In fact, i'll go as far as to say that this was perhaps why Iraq fell without much resistance. US robbed them of an important weapon in their arsenal, hence reducing their potency in war.\n\n \n Okay, the lack of Al-Samoud missiles is nearly irrelevant as far as Iraq's defense goes. Any missile launch would be detected in seconds, anti-missile systems would target the projectile, and either air strikes or cruise missiles would make sure that's the only Iraqi missile launch from that site. Iraq fell without much resistance because the US has the best trained and best equipped troops in the world, backed up by the best technology and military hardware in the world, and led by the finest officers in the world. And we were up against a relatively crappy army whose ranks were half-filled with conscripts, tanks that were antiquated, and they had no air support and generals appointed on the basis of Baathis loyalty and not on military experience or proclivity.\n \n Let me pose this to you: you're a dictator, and the UN is coming to investigate you. You have a decent quantity of outlaw WMDs and you really, really hate the US. You know you'll never defeat them in a military conflict...isn't it possible, even quite probable that what you'll do is sacrifice a handful of insignificant missiles to throw the inspectors off the trail and make it look like you're in compliance, then either move the stockpiles of things like anthrax and VX either to Syria (a friendly country to Saddam, let's not forget)...or just store these things in suitcases and bury them in the desert? Maybe get rid of them by selling them to terrorist groups, who you know would love to get their hands on some? You know you're military is going down fast, so you start focusing on 2 things: personal survival, and revenge. So you go hide in a ditch when the Americans come, but they can't find any WMDs. Now they look like XXXXXX, you might have given the weapons to anti-US powers, and they lose support in the world. Given your circumstances, thats the best you can hope for.\n \n \n \nA much more pertinant question is this, why did USA go to war with Iraq, when the War on Al-qaeda was reaching a crucial phase. Can anyone explain to me why the US has solely focused on Iraq and not on flushing out al-qaeda as soon as possible? Proof of this is that though Iraq has been occupied, Saddam been captured, Al-Qaeda is still surviving, possibly still recruiting, and Osama bin-laden is still elusive!\n\n \n Yeah, I can explain. Iraq is a very public war. You can't conceal the fact that hundreds of thousands of soldiers are being deployed. But the war on al-Qaeda is by necessity a very different kind of war. Are you familiar with the term 'black-ops?' The war on al-Qaeda is a secret war, and I'll guarantee you that neither of us will ever know even a third of what we've done to fight them.\n \n Al-Qaeda is also a much harder enemy to fight than Saddam and his military. We're talking about fighting an enemy which has no military; no tanks to blow up, no aircraft to shoot down, no bases to bomb. What we do know is that we've killed or captured 2/3rds of their known leadership. We've cut their funding. We are hunting down cells. We're putting them on the run. Absolutely, they're still recruiting and training, but that's significantly harder to do now.",
