   "It really depends on the person. Some who believe in God do so because they are taught to, thus making that belief a &#8220;false notion&#8221;.\n However, if every time I broke a mirror I experienced seven years of bad luck, then I couldn&#8217;t help believe it&#8217;s true. Right? If each time I walked under a ladder something bad happened, then I would definitely avoid doing so.\n \n If I pray to God for something, and believe it when I pray, and it happens, then would I not be inclined to believe in God and the power of prayer? Each person holds to a certain belief and to that person there has to be something to substantiate that belief or else soon they fall away from it. If I believe that God is a myth and never &#8220;try&#8221; Him, then my life will be based on that.\n \n To me Malachi 3:10, which says, &#8221;Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house.

To others it is just a fable. So whatever works in your life to give you peace, comfort, and joy, should be your stronghold.

It all boils down to how eager we are at finding out whether that belief or superstition holds water. Just to categorize two things that seem alike as identical depends on how you have tested the results. I have to agree that superstition and the belief in God can be similar notions to some people. But, similarity is not sameness. Similarity is a flexible, fluctuating, and pliable concept. Sameness is firm, unbreakable, and absolute. Two things, persons or ideas may share any number of similarities. That they are partners in similarity, by definition, makes them not the same. As a result, sameness and similarity are mutually exclusive concepts.\n I happen to know for a fact that some people who confess to be Christians and who call the Lord their God, believes in Him about as much as they do the Tooth Fairy.\n Still, to me, there is a vast difference between superstitions and the belief in God.",

I doubt it... but it would be an interesting experiment if it hasn't already been conducted.\n\n I know enough about you to know that you know the difference between fleecing and testing. But, I will try to explain the method of testing that I am familiar with. &#8211; and that by relating to this site.\n Once in one of the Gay Marriage threads I replied in a manner &#8220;off the top of my head&#8221;, which proved to be very devastating; not only to feelings but also to me, personally. I began to feel as though I was speaking from the head and not the heart and I was. In order to come to some knowledge beyond my normal/usual understanding I asked God to help me understand. It took awhile, but God put someone in my life (and I know it was from God, but there&#8217;s no proof) that gave me understanding &#8211; a little at a time. I saw me judging through the eyes of this person&#8217;s parents; saw me denigrating this young person through their actions. And they truly loved him, but had no understanding about this &#8220;problem&#8221;. Soon I began to love this person &#8211; not in a worldly way, but spiritually. In all other aspects of his life he was just like me&#8230;and here I was striving to be like Christ. So, the answer I got was not what I expected, but what I needed in order to understand. In that way God did answer my prayer and gave me more than I asked for.\n \n On the other hand if someone makes their &#8220;prayer&#8221; come true, then they have not actually heard from God. That&#8217;s a cut-and-dried situation. To pray for money, then win the lottery&#8230;well, they had to buy a ticket first. To pray for money and get an unexpected raise or unexpected bonus, who is to say God is not responsible. To pray for a mate, then go &#8220;get&#8221; one &#8211; they went searching. To pray for a mate and &#8220;meet&#8221; someone&#8230;it could be from God. But only we know what we pray for and how we pray for it and where we place ourselves in order to receive it. \n \nBy what measure can a belief in the supernatural be substantiated? Doesn't substantiate imply physical evidence or physical existence?\n \n Websters Main Entry: sub\u00b7stan\u00b7ti\u00b7ate \n 1 : to give substance or form to : EMBODY\n 2 : to establish by proof or competent evidence : VERIFY \n \n This implies that belief in God, by definition, can never be substantiated. It can only be accepted through faith. Individuals may offer their perceptions of personal experiences as evidence that establishes the existence of God, but replace one individual with another individual in the same set of circumstances, and you may get a completely different perception of the exact same personal experience.\n\n The only gauge to monitor is that measure by which we receive things from our belief. If we see that our life is in complete alignment with the scriptures and are following all the precepts of His will, then we can rest assured that God will take care of His end of the bargain. If not, then go back and review the reasons why. Maybe you&#8217;ve lost faith or maybe there&#8217;s something happening or has happened that just shouldn&#8217;t be happening to a child of God, which makes you doubt Him and/or His ways. Maybe something in scripture just isn&#8217;t agreeing with itself for you and you find that if one mistake is made in the Bible &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s all wrong. You don&#8217;t stop and figure out the problem (maybe it&#8217;s that certain problem that can thrust even more forward in faith), but instead, you become afraid and give up.\n God said that faith without works is dead. If He can say that towards us, then we must accept that our faith in Him must be substantiated through His works. It is our duty, our responsibility to test Him &#8211; we&#8217;ve done our part and should expect Him to do His. That&#8217;s okay by Him, He wants that. Without it all the belief we can muster is worthless. Do we have to be pure as the driven snow, spotless and without sin? No. What did jitobear say in billsco&#8217;s Halloween thread? &#8220;The good Lord is not a child, if I can understand intent, he surely can.&#8221; God knows us&#8230;and we need to be able to understand ourselves as much as He does.\n \nRon, I'm curious whether this is an easily imagineable hypothetical, or if you are aware of a specific instance of this happening. My 97 year old grandmother died recently. She was a very spiritual woman -- spending many hours a day in prayer. She seemed to be struggling with 'letting go' toward the end, and I wondered whether she may have been dealing with this most fundamental question.\n\n Purely hypothetical, but possible. Wouldn&#8217;t you agree?\n Your grandmother could have been on a mission that she had not fully completed. Maybe she felt that there was just one more thing she needed to do. In all her years and in all those hours of prayer, she probably had insight into scripture and for our reason(s) for being here more than anyone. When so many are left &#8220;out there&#8221; without the truth, the human instinct is to save just one more &#8211; when that close to God. That is my take on it.\n \nYou attempt to make a distinction here between superstition and belief in God. However... let's take the same thing in the context of a superstition that you said about 'true belief in God.' \n \n For example, belief that touching a photo of a lost loved one everyday upon waking -- true belief -- will result in you spending a glorious, eternal afterlife with that person.

How is this different than a belief in God?\n\n Unfortunately there are people that put faith in things like that. In my experience it becomes more an addiction than a belief, but I will take it from there, as you stated, and reply with what I believe.\n If a person believes that our spirit can become detached from us, leaving just a shell, then they have no concept of the meaning of &#8220;life&#8221;. Our inner person needs to believe in something in order to survive this cruel world. Some find this out early, some late, and for some it takes a lifetime. Unfortunately some never do accept it. But for those that rely on physical things to bring them peace it all too soon becomes a god to them. They begin to worship it, knowingly or not, and begin to rely on it for strength. And even though it brings them comfort and those old familiar feelings now and then, it cannot give them &#8220;life&#8221;. It cannot give them what they need. The biggest problem I see with the photo analogy is that it can burn up, be stolen, or just rubbed out in time. That holds true with those that have found a hollow god and why I can relate to someone finding the belief in God just a superstition. I have heard so many times: &#8220;Just give me one more reason to believe, just one more, and I&#8217;ll live like You want me to, Lord.&#8221; That prayer gets answered, but sadly they don&#8217;t place themselves in position to realize it.",

   "But if or when religious faith influences public policy (in education etc.), then other considerations begin to apply.\n\n We agree here. Religion can be a nasty business. And I feel that if there did come a day that the Bible was taught in schools again that it would be left up to the regions/districts. There is no religion that is or could be agreed upon nationally that could be introduced into schools.\n \nHaving said this first, I still cannot detect any difference between a deep-\n rooted but unfounded belief ( a superstition), and the \"true belief\" in which\n you place your confidence.\n\n It is hard to grasp. I understand.",

I'm afraid that there would be some sort of hidden agenda in religion these days - not like it was in the 60's when Mrs. Grubbs knew just what to say...and not say.",
