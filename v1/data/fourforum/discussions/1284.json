It's also nice that you can go so long without calling names. Keep up the good work. :-)\n\n \n There is no pro-abortion \"rhetoric\" here.",

I thought you said morals were relative.\n \n \"So, you're saying that your god is a hypocrit? Do as I say, not as I do?\"\n \n Certainly not. The fact is, God has a right to do things we don't. God is not bound by moral law, he created moral law.\n \n \"If not then why have so many states placing a halt on the death penalty? With the advent of DNA testing they are discovering that many of the people on death roll are innocent and more of them are black as well.\"\n \n They've placed it on halt not because there are a huge number of wrongfully convicted people, but because just ONE is important and they want to be sure.\n \n \"It is a non-question.\"\n \n It is a question you seem to be scared to death to answer.\n \n \"Please, just watch the news. They don't have to \"dug up every square inch\" to search. All they have to do is use any of the satellites which are also used for geological surveys. The UN Inspectors, and they were experts, for there for months, and the USA has been there for many more months, with much more detection equipment, and they haven't found any credible evidence to speak of. The only reason why they think that Saddam had WMD is because most of them the USA sold to Saddam years ago. They just had to look at their receipts. The trouble with that is that he had already used most of them up 12 years ago and they have a short shelf life.\"\n \n That's a perfectly valid response, that's a good reason to believe there are no WMD. However, that isn't what I was asking. My question is, how did you become so sure? How can you be positive?",
