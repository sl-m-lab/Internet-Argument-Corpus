   "Concerning Graham coaching Alito (I\\'ll try to find the WSJ wire source:\n \n http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0602,roston,71634,6.html\n \n Alito and His Coaches\n For Supreme Court nominee, hearings are an inside game\n by James Ridgeway with Michael Roston\n January 10th, 2006 9:59 AM\n WASHINGTON, D.C.--In the first hours of Samuel Alito\\'s Senate confirmation hearings on Monday, Judiciary Committee member Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, may very well have irreparably compromised himself. \n \n At the hearing, Graham told Alito, nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court, that he had already decided in Alito\\'s favor. \"I don\\'t know what kind of vote you\\'re going to get, but you\\'ll make it through. It\\'s possible you could talk me out of voting for you, but I doubt it. So I won\\'t even try to challenge you along those lines.\"\n \n That certainly ought to be the case. Graham is one of a group of Republicans who have been coaching Alito behind the scenes. The Wall Street Journal\\'s Washington Wire reported before the hearings began: \n \n \"On Thursday, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of the \\'gang of 14\\' who sits on Judiciary, joined a so-called moot court session at the White House.\\'\\' \n \n The coaching session for Alito has raised a few eyebrows. \n \n \"Coaching a judicial nominee behind-the-scenes is not the proper role for a Judiciary Committee member who must subsequently sit in judgment on that nominee,\" writes Think Progress, a project of the American Progress Action Fund. \"It could be a violation of the ethical duties of a senator.\" \n \n Writing about the Alito situation, Think Progress cites Senate Rule 37 in the Senate Ethics Manual. The rule says: \"No Member, officer, or employee shall engage in any outside business or professional activity or employment for compensation which is inconsistent or in conflict with the conscientious performance of official duties.\"\n \n Think Progress further cites the ethics manual, saying that language has been interpreted as prohibiting \"compensated employment or uncompensated positions on boards, commissions, or advisory councils where such service could create a conflict with an individual\\'s Senate duties due to appropriation, oversight, authorization, or legislative jurisdiction as a result of Senate duties.\"\n \n If this is true, how can Graham make an impartial decision about Alito based on what he learns at the Alito hearings? Graham has already made up his mind.",

This makes no sense and is illogical. You continue by saying any law that doesn't go for glbt people you want struck down...under what authority though? Because you want it and selfishness is the way to go? If you want to be a dicator then I suggest moving to a different country. The view \"give me what I want NOW\" is a view of either a 2 year old or a dicator.",

Municipalities could not simply take people's homes and give them to a land developer that wanted to build a mall or business complex. The developer had to negotiate with private property owners to acquire their land for private development, it could not simply be siezed for such use.\n \n With the ruling in the Kelo case the interpretation has changed. Municipalities can now sieze private property and give it to another private owner if a developer requests it with some claim that they can increase the property tax value of the land. The court has now decided that a higher property tax value is a valid public use. The court has effectively written a new law that favors the government in cases where it wants to sieze land to increase property taxes. See? The Constitution didn't change, the interpretation did and in doing so the law has changed.",

As the Court has observed, \"Americans are engaged in an earnest and profound debate about the morality, legality, and practicality of physician-assisted suicide.\" Washington v.Glucksberg ,521 U.S.702,735 (1997). The dispute before us is in part a product of this political and moral debate, but its resolution requires an inquiry familiar to the courts:interpreting a federal statute to determine whether Executive action is authorized by, or otherwise consistent with, the enactment.\n\n Public debate or opinion should have zero bearing since the court is not supposed to represent the people, that is the job of the Legislature.",
