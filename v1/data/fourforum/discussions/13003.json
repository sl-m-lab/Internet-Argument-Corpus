She suffered a horrific injury during labor called a fistula that left her incontinent and smelly, and for the next 13 years she was confined to her house - never stepping outside for shame at the way she was leaking wastes....\n \n Here in Pakistan, a woman dies every 35 minutes because of problems from pregnancy or childbirth, according to United Nations figures.\n \n The underlying reason is that maternal health has never been a priority globally, either to poor countries or to foreign aid donors like the United States. The only exceptions are Britain and Norway, and I hope the Obama administration will back them up.\n \n In this part of Pakistan, Sindh Province, there is a saying that goes: If your cow dies, that is a tragedy; if your wife dies, you can always get another.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/opinion/19kristof.html\n \n Oh yeah, women are cheaper than cows.

   "You have quite an imagination. Calling the removal of a fertilized egg the \"butchering of a baby\" is like calling the act of putting hand sanitizer on your hands to kill germs \"the worst and most bloody genocide the country has ever seen since the holocaust\". I'm not buying it, and neither is America.\n\n \n See, this is the problem I have with the approach some pro-choicers take, and it's this sort of thing that fuels the feeling out there that society needs to value life more than it does.\n A germ doesn't grow into a baby, child, adolescent, etc. It's a germ. It's not the same thing.\n Surely you can see the difference here.\n \n Butchering of a baby\" may be overkill on terms of rhetoric. I can accept that.\n But likening the embryo to a germ? No. Both sides need to accept that each one's positions needs some respect.",
