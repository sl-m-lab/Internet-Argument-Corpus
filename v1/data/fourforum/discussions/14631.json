They have not shown the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Policy 'significantly furthers' the Government's interests nor that it is 'necessary' in order to achieve those goals..... regulations of speech in a military context will survive Constitutional scrutiny if they 'restrict speech no more than is reasonably necessary to protect the substantial government interest.' .... The Don't Ask, Don't Tell Act fails this test of constitutional validity.... the Act's restrictions on speech not only are broader than reasonably necessary to protect the Government's substantial interests, but also actually serve to impede military readiness and unit cohesion rather than further these goals.\"\n http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/PhillipsDecision.pdf",

This was simply an activist judge.\n\n \n IT is not up to the plaintiff to disprove the governments claim of military interests. It is up to the government to prove military interests, and then to show that the military interests in question are dire enough to justify curtailing fundamental rights to meet it.\n \n While the military has \"discriminated\" (if you want to call it that), the have been allowed to do so only when they could argue successfully that failure to do so would cause irrevocable harm to their mission. Virtually all of their guidelines are formed around that concept. For example, they cannot discriminate against muslims, but they can insist that muslims in the military meet military dress and grooming requirements and they do not have to let them drop out of formation, or remove themselves from duty, to pray. \n \n Frankly, your post does not make any sense at all. First you say that the higher courts will not touch it. Then you say that it will be overturned, which means the higher courts will have to have touched it. Then you say it has a problem with lack of standing (debatable at best), but that does not actually matter since the government did not really argue lack of standing. Protesting standing is pretty much SOP in any case where an organization sues on behalf of its members because you MIGHT get lucky and find that they dont have standing if they cannot actually produce a member who meets the guidelines for conveying standing to the organization. It is pretty much nothing but a procedural hail mary. In this case they found that the Association had standing, and through several different members (they only presented 2, but claimed many more). That is pretty bulletproof. To really have a shot at getting the suit dismissed for lack of standing they would have to show that the members themselves lacked standing. Anything short of that is pretty much just the normal paperwork that comes with this kind of case. \n \n You say the case is flawed and the ruling is flawed. How do you see it as being flawed??",
