   "If you want to make an interesting debate, why not answer the question of how life came into existence through chance, and what are the probable odds of this world of diverse and unique life forms coming about by random mutations? That is the crux of your debate with D.R. after all. And let's start with this excerpt from the link:\n Here are the crucial numbers:\n \n Proteins vary in length from strings of a few hundred to a few thousand amino acids. Consider a relatively short protein, such as 200 amino acids long. Into each of the 200 spaces any one of the 20 amino acids can fall. That means the total number of possible combinations is 20 times 20 times 20 repeated 200 times. The result is a one with 260 zeros after it, or 10 to the power of 260 or a billion billion billion repeated 29 times. From this vast biological grab bag, we are told that nature by random chance mutations has been able to form the fewer than a million proteins that don't kill the organism. This did not, and could not, and will not happen by chance. And every biologist enamored with neo-Darwinian evolution knows it. Their feeble reply is that there must be other factors that limit the types of mutations that can occur. There certainly are&#8230;but not as randomly as the materialist biologist would have it.\n \n The unrealistic possibility that the selection of viable proteins could have occurred by unguided random mutations in the DNA led Simon Conway Morris, professor of evolutionary paleobiology at Cambridge University, Fellow of the Royal Society of England, and possibly the world's leading paleontologist, to write his book, Life's Solutions (Cambridge University Press, 2003). In it we read: \"Life is simply too complex to be assembled by random reactions on any believable time scale. &#8230; evolution [has the] uncanny ability to find the short cuts across the multidimensional hyperspace of biological reality. &#8230;\"\n \n This opinion is also found in the writing of Nobel laureate, organic chemist and a leader in origin of life studies, Professor de Duve, in his excellent book, Tour of a Living Cell:\n \n \"If you equate the probability of the birth of a bacteria cell to chance assembly of its atoms, eternity will not suffice to produce one. ... Faced with the enormous sum of lucky draws behind the success of the evolutionary game, one may legitimately wonder to what extent this success is actually written into the fabric of the universe.\" \n \n Life written into the fabric of the universe. Sounds like design to me. \n \n Noble laureate, Professor of Biology, Harvard University, the late George Wald, may have provided us with the answer to this wonder when he wrote \"Life and Mind in the Universe\" in the International Journal of Quantum Chemistry: Quantum Biology symposium 11 (1984):\n \n \"It has occurred to me lately - I must confess with some shock at first to my scientific sensibilities &#8211; that both questions [the origin of consciousness in humans and of life from non-living matter] might be brought into some degree of congruence. This is with the assumption that mind, rather than emerging as a late outgrowth in the evolution of life, has existed always as the matrix, the source and condition of physical reality &#8211; that stuff of which physical reality is composed is mind-stuff. It is mind that has composed a physical universe that breeds life&#8230;.\"\n \n This is science, not theology, speaking. But it is also theology.Tothesource\n \n D.R. don't even respond to childs baiting and irrelevant question. Make him answer to the mathematical impossibility of what he claims to be reality. The crux of this debate is was it random mutation or intelligent design that led to life on Earth. And by using the scientifically accepted study of mathematical probability, it has been absolutely proven that even given eternity as a time scale, what evolutionists claim to have led to life is impossible to have occurred. By the way child, this post answers you questions above...",

   "All pieces of information must have a sender.\n\n \n Oh dear. We once again see the fallacious 'information' argument being used. The craters on the moon give us information about past impacts, do we demand that information has a 'sender'? Spectroscopy gives us information about the constitution of stars, do we demand that information has a 'sender'?\n \n And indeed even if we use the argument that all 'information' has a sender and recipient, genetic material has...neither. It's just chemicals and forces. Nothing more. There is no identifiable 'sender', and there is no identifiable 'recipient'. Sure, you can chuck a god in here or there if you like, but that's not where the evidence leads. DNA is not a code, DNA is certainly not a 'language', and it only falls under the definition of 'information' that pretty much everything we decide to look at does.\n \n \nChance is unreasonable.....mathmatically impossible in the scope of the infinite \"chance happenings\" which are \"believed\" to have \"taken place.\"\n\n \n This is pretty much meaningless without elaboration.\n \n \n One cell division lasts from20 to 80 minutes, during that time, the entire molecular library, equivalent to one thousand books, is copied correctly. \n\n \n Meaningless analogy as you are talking about deterministic chemical reactions, not the equivalent of \"1000 books\" whatever that is supposed to suggest - for example, in the context of chemistry, how do you know that a reaction \"equivalent to copying 1000 books\" is difficult or uncommon? \n \n \n \nChance?
