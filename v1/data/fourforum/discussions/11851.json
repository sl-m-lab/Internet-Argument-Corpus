   "cbs2.com - Halloween Palin Prop Sparks Controversy In WeHo\n \n \n \nHalloween Palin Prop Sparks Controversy In WeHo\n \n WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) &#8213; A Halloween decoration showing a mannequin dressed as vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin hanging by a noose from the roof of a West Hollywood home is drawing giggles from some passers-by and gasps of outrage from others. \n \n The mannequin is dressed in brunet wig, glasses and a red business suit. Another mannequin dressed as John McCain emerges from a flaming chimney. \n \n Chad Michael Morisette, who lives in the house, told CBS 2 News that drivers and bus passengers have been stopping to snap pictures of the macabre scene. \n \n Morisette says the effigy would be out of bounds at any other time of year, but it's within the spirit of Halloween. \n \n He says \"it should be seen as art, and as within the month of October. It's Halloween, it's time to be scary it's time to be spooky.\" \n\n \n Pictures in link. Absolutely tasteless.\n \n Imagine the outpouring of outrage that would storm over the biased media and the Obamaniacs if it had been reversed and a McCain supporter had hung an effigy of Obama from a noose. There'd be cries of racism, etc.\n \n Funny how we don't see that in this case- in fact the only way I heard about it was from a friend that lives in the area who saw it only on the local news station.\n \n The double standard is glaring.",
