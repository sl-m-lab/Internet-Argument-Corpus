   "If you're gay and you die in Rhode Island your domestic partner won't be able to make funeral arrangements for you because Governor Donald Carcieri just vetoed a bill providing for that.\n \n According to Carcieri, \"This bill represents a disturbing trend over the past few years of the incremental erosion of the principles surrounding traditional marriage, which is not the preferred way to approach this issue. If the General Assembly believes it would like to address the issue of domestic partnerships, it should place the issue on the ballot and let the people of the state of Rhode Island decide.''\n \n Carcieri, who is also a strong supporter of the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), recently told the crowd of more than 300 at a fundraiser for the anti-gay group Massachusetts Family Institute that marriage is \"not a civil right\". Said the governor: \"It is a not civil right. I get aggravated when it is portrayed that way. Marriage is a license by the state. It is about a state's responsibility, which is the reason why states don't allow a lot of types of marriages.\"\n\n Rhode Island Governor Won't Even Give Rights to Dead Gays - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men\n \n Again, I reference another poster's attempt to pretend that the \"anti-gay\" approach was just about \"disapproval\". emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Gay couples who dedicate their lives to each other should have their PRIVATE wishes respected.\n If John and Mark are in a committed relationship, HOW is it an \"erosion\" of marriage to recognize that John would want Mark to take care of the funeral planning?\n \n Obviously, whether due to self-inflicted delusion or blatant lying, the anti-gays who oppose such simple thing as a NON-MARRIAGE related law which states that gay couples have the power to plan for each other's funeral arrangements ARE NOT just talking about \"disapproval\".\n \n And as I have posted on a variety of other threads, there are CLEAR examples where the anti-gay proponents behave incredibly poorly in the face of a gay relative's demise, and spitefully and with glaring bigotry they can (and do) put the surviving partner through hades.",

Show the evil anti gay family snatching the dying man from his lovers arms. Show the anti gay preaches dragging a child away from her mothers all while the the child is scream and crying for her mother. Show the anti gay Christians throwing a gay man out of his home. \n \n More commercials like this one.\n YouTube - \"Home Invasion\": Vote NO on Prop 8 \n \n Or show heteros in the same state play religion against itself.",
