My target assault rifle is STRICTLY for targets. It is machined to such tight tollerance that is is utterly USLESS as a battlefield weapon. It must be kept so clean that typical battlefield dirt and dust will cause it to malfunction. It is a surgical tool which requires near operating room conditions (for a rifle) to operate. I would not even trust it to go hunting. I trust that with tuned ammo and comming out surgically clean from it's case, it will win matches and punch holes in paper. I think you have an idea based on prejudice and lack of information.",

The most commonly used rifles on the competition circuit are so-called \"assault weapons\".\n \n The \"assault weapon\" moniker is a term just recently fashioned to describe a military looking weapon.\n \n There are several target competitions designed solely for these types of rifles.",
