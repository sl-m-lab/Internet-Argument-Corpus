   "  Gunrunning scandal uncovered at the ATF \nATF managers allegedly made a controversial decision: allow most of the weapons on the streets. The idea, they said, was to gather intelligence and see where the guns ended up. (Tither's comment. BS I think this was an attempt to make the problem larger than it really is so they could curtail our Rights! How did I get this impression? Keep reading) Insiders say it's a dangerous tactic called letting the guns, \"walk.\"\n \n One agent called the strategy \"insane.\" Another said: \"We were fully aware the guns would probably be moved across the border to drug cartels where they could be used to kill.\" \n \n On the phone, one Project Gunrunner source (who didn't want to be identified) told us just how many guns flooded the black market under ATF's watchful eye. \"The numbers are over 2,500 on that case by the way. That's how many guns were sold - including some 50-calibers they let walk.\"\n\n People killed in Mexico and the U.S. Courtesy of our very own government! emoticon_cry\n \n  Over at Clean Up the ATF dot org \n \n \nWord is that curios George Gillett the Phoenix ASAC stepped on it again. Allegedly he has approved more than 500 AR-15 type rifles from Tucson and Phoenix cases to be \"walked\" to Mexico. Appears that ATF may be one of the largest suppliers of assault rifles to the Mexican cartels! One of these rifles is rumored to have been linked to the recent killing of a Border Patrol Officer in Nogales, AZ. Can anyone confirm this information?\n\n \n I wish them luck in cleaning up some Vere Slimy Acts!\n \n  More on BP agent Brian Terry \n On  Fox News. \n Confirmation that the gun used to kill Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry came from sales by a dealer cooperating with an ATF investigation. Senate Judiciary Committee is said to be investigating.\n \n It confirms another detail that was being reported on the internet. Understand, Terry was on something like a SWAT team, on an extremely dangerous mission. They were out at night seeking border robbery teams that range into the US to rob entering drug runners. I suppose the only thing more dangerous than encountering a drug cartel team is encountering a gang who robs those teams. Anybody who figures on taking on the Zetas is dangerous indeed.\n\n \n Want to clean up the guns coming into Mexico from the U.S.? Apparently one needs to stop the ATF from making the problem worse.",

   "\n Are you suggesting those weapons would not have been smuggled if the ATF knew nothing of them? Silly.\n\n \n Yes. And not only is it not silly, by all indications it is the verifiable truth. The dealer that sold those guys wanted to DECLINE the sale because the guy he was selling them to was obviously a straw purchaser and was smuggling them over the border. The ATF ordered the dealer to make the sales. Had they not, the merchant would have declined the sale and those guns would either still be sitting on the shelf, or would have been sold to a law abiding citizen. \n \n \n\n A bad decision made by someone in the BATFE in the hopes of uncovering the details of the smuggling network.\n\n \n A bad decision??? The BATFE ordered dealers to make gun sales that they knew to be illegal and then helped ensure they made it across the border by keeping US law enforcement at bay. That is not \"a bad decision\", that is gun running. Then a border patrol agent was shot with a weapon that was only in mexico because the ATF ordered a gun dealer to make an illegal sale and then kept their agents back so it could be transported across the border. \n \n Frankly the claim by the ATF that they were trying to uncover the details of the smuggling networks is completely and totally nonsensical. Both the ATF and Mexican law enforcement have confirmed that the mexicans had no idea what was going on...the ATF did not advise them of their activities at all. If they were trying to break the smuggling ring, wouldnt it be important to know what happens to the guns AFTER they enter mexico?? The BATFE has NO FIELD OPERATIONS in Mexico. Both the ATF and mexican authorities have confirmed this. \n \n That begs the question....exactly what the hell were they trying to do again??? They put thousands of guns across the border with absolutely no ability or effort to find out what happened to them on the other side. Sorry, the \"trying to crack smuggling ring\" excuse just went right out the window. The \"trying to justify their budget\" claim from sources inside the ATF suddenly looks a LOT more likely.",

That's what you consider the ATF failing to halt suspicious sales and instead let them go ahead and thus contribute to the number of weapons smuggled into Mexico for the purpose of furthering hostility and killing innocent people? You call that a bad decision?\n \n Let's have a closer look at the CBS story and discuss what's covered here: Gunrunning scandal uncovered at the ATF - CBS Evening News - CBS News\n \n \nIn late 2009, ATF was alerted to suspicious buys at seven gun shops in the Phoenix area. Suspicious because the buyers paid cash, sometimes brought in paper bags. And they purchased classic \"weapons of choice\" used by Mexican drug traffickers - semi-automatic versions of military type rifles and pistols.\n \n Sources tell CBS News several gun shops wanted to stop the questionable sales, but ATF encouraged them to continue.\n \n Jaime Avila was one of the suspicious buyers. ATF put him in its suspect database in January of 2010. For the next year, ATF watched as Avila and other suspects bought huge quantities of weapons supposedly for \"personal use.\" They included 575 AK-47 type semi-automatic rifles.\n\n \n In this article by CBS we learn the name of the suspected smuggle Jaime Avila. Jaime Avila was on an ATF watchlist for a year and yet he was among those who were allowed to make a bare minimum of 575 purchases during that time frame. Not only was Jaime Avila and others able to purchase guns in America, the ATF told the dealers that they were basically required to complete the transactions regardless of what they wanted.\n \n That hardly sounds like a bad decision on part of the ATF. That's more like 575 consecutive bad decisions in a row in a one year period. And that's just with AK-47 type rifles. What's the total number Jaime Avila and his posse are responsible for? We could be looking at a rate of 50 \"bad decisions\" per day going on.\n \n Although there is an interesting point brought to light by this article. A point other than the sheer amount of corruption within the ATF.\n \n For a considerable amount of time we've been hearing about the ATF requesting authority to mandate that FFL dealers along the border forward multiple sales records on buyers who purchase two or more rifles within a five-day period. Applying the same sales reporting standards currently in place for handguns to rifles. We've been hearing all the usual suspects about how this would be an effective crime fighting tool and help law enforcement discover all kinds of important information.\n \n And yet even without such power in place the ATF was able to place Jaime Avila in the suspect folder and monitor him making multiple purchases throughout the year. They just stood by and watched him buy rifle after rifle after rifle, even telling the FFL dealers to take no action that would interfere in his purchases.\n \n Obviously the ATF doesn't need any further authority to keep tabs on suspicious buyers. Although I do believe they need to be investigated on charges of corruption and possibly aiding criminal activity. Standing by while allowing suspicious sales to take place? In terms of comparison that would be like a patrol officer coming up on a store being robbed, but instead of taking any action he allows the robbery and possible murder of the store owner to take place, do nothing in the mean time, and waiting to see if the same suspect robs another store at a later date.",

   "Yes, a very bad call. Forgive me, I'm not given to hyperbole. A controversial decision within the BATFE let's remember.\n\n \n A controversial decision? That's putting it quite mildly.

You're very well known for your position that it should be a crime for a private individual to sell a gun to another private individual without first establishing a paper trail that can be searched by the government at a later date. You've argued this basic position countless times before but I've yet to see significant justification presented by you as to why this position should be put forth and exactly how it would do any good. You've been unable to defend your own ideals when presented with criticism by others. Perhaps you could take another stab at explaining it.\n \n \nI don't see corruption in the ATF as a significant component here. Conspiracy theorists might imagine otherwise.\n\n \n Surely there must be corruption involved if the ATF agents who spoke requested that their names be withheld.\n \n \nMaybe something is required to get some FFL's to do the right thing?\n\n \n You mean selling to suspicious individuals because they were ordered to do so by the ATF?\n \n Exactly how would multiple sales reports filed in rifle purchases qualify as \"the right thing?\" That implies that withholding such reports is somehow wrong in nature. There's no congressional authority governing multiple sales records of long guns. In fact an amendment to a funding bill is being put through that would prevent the ATF from trying to bypass the authority of congress to mandate multiple sales records on long guns. Bill H.R. 1.\n \n So explain, where does your claim of \"do the right thing\" come from in this case?\n \n \nMr. Avila is now under indictment. Gathering evidence isn't \"standing by and watching\" with no intention of doing anything about it.\n\n \n And they really needed to wait over a year and allow hundreds of purchases to take place?

Maybe ATF would like to uncover more suspicious buyers they haven't flagged as yet.\n\n \n This anti-privacy crusade of yours is really getting old. You claim my analogies suck, but the fact that you've withheld explanation for why California's policies should be expanded to the nation level is truly pitiful.

Some of those weapons did, in fact, come from the United States, but they weren't the result of the \"gun show loophole\" straw-man purchases or any of the other individual criminal acts anti-gun groups would have you believe.\n \n Large quantities of those US weapons -everything from rifles to machine guns, grenade launchers, explosives and ammunition, came from purchases by the government of Mexico from the United States. As the underpaid, undermanned and undermined soldiers of the Mexican army skipped out on the military to put their training to work for the cartels, they took their issued-arms with them. \n \n Others come from weapon buys from guerilla groups in South and Central America that are then smuggled into the country.\n \n No specific numbers on how many of those guns \"recovered in Mexico and traced back to the United States\" were, in fact, military purchases, but the State Department cables indicate a portion of the fewer than 12 percent of the traceable weapons actually came from the United States in gun shop/individual type purchases. Remember, that's not 12 percent of the tens of thousands of weapons recovered - it's only 12 percent of the weapons recovered that were traceable. It's nowhere near the 12 percent figure that has been misquoted and used as evidence of the United State's \"horrific\" problem of illegal gun sales.\n \n Republished from The Outdoor Wire.\n \n \n\n \n We know they got over 3,000 courtesy of ATF too.",

Go back and read it again. \n \n I will be the first to agree that it is phrased deceptively, but the 10,000 weapons seized and 1.1 million rounds of ammo seized are the \"fruits\" of project gunrunner as a whole, NOT the result of the \"new strategy\".\n \n As far as the \"new strategy\" goes, it does not exist. No efforts were made to track the weapons once they crossed the border and mexican law enforcement was not even given a heads up that the ATF was helping straw purchasers get thousands of guns to send across the border. \n \n That being the case, there is NO POSSIBILITY that the \"new strategy\" could even possibly be successful since the plan lacked a vital component typically included in law enforcement strategies...namely arresting the bad guys. Granted, now that they have been caught they are going around and arresting the people who they have been helping smuggle guns for over a year now. \n \n I just cant seem to find it in my heart to cut the ATF any slack over this. They are blowing tax dollars on a pointless operation, and have been complicit in smuggling weapons in order to justify their budget. There is not another side to this story. \n \n There is no question that US weapons are being used in Mexico:\n \n http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20110213034624314\n \n \nPentagon Fingered as a Source of Narco-Firepower in Mexico\n \n The Big Clubs in Mexico's Drug War Aren't Slipping Through the Gun-Show Loophole\n \n Another series of leaked State Department cables made public this week by WikiLeaks lend credence to investigative reports on gun trafficking and the drug war published by Narco News as far back as 2009.\n \n Rather, we reported at the time, \"the drug trafficking organizations are now in possession of high-powered munitions in vast quantities that can't be explained by the gun-show loophole.\"\n \n Those weapons, found in stashes seized by Mexican law enforcers and military over the past several years, include U.S.-military issued rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and explosives.\n \n The State Department cables released recently by WikiLeaks support Narco News' reporting and also confirm that our government is very aware that much of the heavy firepower now in the hands of Mexican criminal organizations isn't linked to mom-and-pop gun stores, but rather the result of blowback from U.S. arms-trading policies (both current and dating back to the Iran/Contra era) that put billions of dollars of deadly munitions into global trade stream annually.\n \n\n \n \n To put this into perspective, the drug traffickers are estimated to have roughly 470,000 people in their organizations that they can call upon to fight. Suddenly 10,000 guns seized by the billion dollar operation gunrunner looks pretty pathetic. And they have known this since 2007. \n \n So the cartels are literally cleaning out mexican army weapons depots, and arming themselves with everything from M4's to grenade launchers to .50 heavy machine guns. How worried to we really need to be about semi automatic weapons from the US ending up in mexico?",

   "We've got more news on the ATF deliberately trafficking guns to Mexico. Not only did they know about it they actually videotaped it taking place. And we now have an agent willing to give his name in response.\n \n Agent: I was ordered to let U.S. guns into Mexico - CBS Evening News - CBS News\n \n \nWASHINGTON - Federal agent John Dodson says what he was asked to do was beyond belief.\n \n He was intentionally letting guns go to Mexico?\n \n \"Yes ma'am,\" Dodson told CBS News. \"The agency was.\"\n \n An Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms senior agent assigned to the Phoenix office in 2010, Dodson's job is to stop gun trafficking across the border. Instead, he says he was ordered to sit by and watch it happen.\n \n Investigators call the tactic letting guns \"walk.\" In this case, walking into the hands of criminals who would use them in Mexico and the United States. \n \n Dodson's bosses say that never happened. Now, he's risking his job to go public.\n \n \"I'm boots on the ground in Phoenix, telling you we've been doing it every day since I've been here,\" he said. \"Here I am. Tell me I didn't do the things that I did. Tell me you didn't order me to do the things I did. Tell me it didn't happen. Now you have a name on it. You have a face to put with it. Here I am. Someone now, tell me it didn't happen.\"\n \n Agent Dodson and other sources say the gun walking strategy was approved all the way up to the Justice Department. The idea was to see where the guns ended up, build a big case and take down a cartel. And it was all kept secret from Mexico.\n \n ATF named the case \"Fast and Furious.\"\n \n Surveillance video obtained by CBS News shows suspected drug cartel suppliers carrying boxes of weapons to their cars at a Phoenix gun shop. The long boxes shown in the video being loaded in were AK-47-type assault rifles.\n \n So it turns out ATF not only allowed it - they videotaped it.\n \n Documents show the inevitable result: The guns that ATF let go began showing up at crime scenes in Mexico. And as ATF stood by watching thousands of weapons hit the streets... the Fast and Furious group supervisor noted the escalating Mexican violence.\n \n One e-mail noted, \"958 killed in March 2010 ... most violent month since 2005.\" The same e-mail notes: \"Our subjects purchased 359 firearms during March alone,\" including \"numerous Barrett .50 caliber rifles.\"\n \n Dodson feels that ATF was partly to blame for the escalating violence in Mexico and on the border. \"I even asked them if they could see the correlation between the two,\" he said. \"The more our guys buy, the more violence we're having down there.\"\n \n Senior agents including Dodson told CBS News they confronted their supervisors over and over.\n \n Their answer, according to Dodson, was, \"If you're going to make an omelette, you've got to break some eggs.\"\n \n There was so much opposition to the gun walking, that an ATF supervisor issued an e-mail noting a \"schism\" among the agents. \"Whether you care or not people of rank and authority at HQ are paying close attention to this case...we are doing what they envisioned.... If you don't think this is fun you're in the wrong line of work... Maybe the Maricopa County jail is hiring detention officers and you can get $30,000 ... to serve lunch to inmates...\"\n \n \"We just knew it wasn't going to end well. There's just no way it could,\" Dodson said. \n \n On Dec. 14, 2010, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was gunned down. Dodson got the bad news from a colleague.\n \n According to Dodson, \"They said, 'Did you hear about the border patrol agent?' And I said, 'Yeah.' And they said 'Well it was one of the Fast and Furious guns.' There's not really much you can say after that.\"\n \n Two assault rifles ATF had let go nearly a year before were found at Terry's murder.\n \n Dodson said, \"I felt guilty. I mean it's crushing. I don't know how to explain it.\"\n \n Sen. Grassley began investigating after his office spoke to Dodson and a dozen other ATF sources -- all telling the same story. \n \n The response was \"practically zilch,\" Grassley said. \"From the standpoint that documents we want - we have not gotten them. I think it's a case of stonewalling.\"\n \n Dodson said he hopes that speaking out helps Terry's family. They haven't been told much of anything about his murder - or where the bullet came from.\n \n \"First of all, I'd tell them that I'm sorry. Second of all, I'd tell them I've done everything that I can for them to get the truth,\" Dodson said. \"After this, I don't know what else I can do. But I hope they get it.\"\n \n Dodson said they never did take down a drug cartels. However, he said thousands of Fast and Furious weapons are still out there and will be claiming victims on both sides of the border for years to come.\n \n Late tonight, the ATF said it will convene a panel to look into its national firearms trafficking strategy. But it refused to comment specifically on Sharyl's report.\n \n Statement from Kenneth E. Melson, Acting Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives:\n \n \"The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) will ask a multi-disciplinary panel of law enforcement professionals to review the bureau's current firearms trafficking strategies employed by field division managers and special agents. This review will enable ATF to maximize its effectiveness when undertaking complex firearms trafficking investigations and prosecutions. It will support the goals of ATF to stem the illegal flow of firearms to Mexico and combat firearms trafficking in the United States.\"\n",

   "BATFE ought to be a convenience store:\n \n \nAbuse Continues at BATFE\n \n The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) is entangled in yet another scandal.\n \n The latest controversy involves Project Gunrunner. The BATFE knowingly allowed firearms to get into the hands of Mexican drug gangs, instructing American gun dealers to go ahead with questionable-and even illegal-gun sales. When two of these guns wound up at the crime scene of a murdered Border Patrol agent, at least one U.S. Senator is calling the agency to task.\n \n In addition, Gun Owners of America has written a petition to the Congress, urging that the BATFE be stripped of its jurisdiction over firearms.\n \n The history of this agency is one marred in abuse of its power and the trampling of the rights of Americans. In fact, as far back as 1982, a Senate subcommittee noted that ATF \"has trampled upon the Second Amendment by chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.\"\n \n Action: Please click here and follow the link to learn more about the recent outrage along the border, and sign a petition that will be delivered straight to your Representative and Senators asking them to rein in this unconstitutional agency.\n \n",
