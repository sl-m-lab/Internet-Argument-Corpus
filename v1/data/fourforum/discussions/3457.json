   "What a defeatist attitude you have.\n\n \n I suppose. I generally call it \"realistic\" as opposed to \"defeatist\", but to each their own.\n \n \n \nConfused? First you say you don't believe in killing children unless it's \"absolutly (sic) necessary\", then you say you can't imagine a time that it would be absolutely necessary. Can't you make up your mind?\n\n \n Yes I can make up my mind. All I am saying is that while, right now, I can think of no situation where killing a child would be absolutly necessary, one never knows what tommorow might bring. \n \n \nAgain, your argument doesn't make good sense. First you say a fetus has no chance against someone who wants to kill it. I agree with this.

It just wouldn't stop crying, so they killed it.\n \n Until a child gets old enough, smart enough and strong enough to outrun or hide from someone trying to kil them, they have no chance of survival. Your argument is all wet.\n\n \n I am saying that it is an instinct inherent in the animal kingdom to protect the young of your own species (at least in higher order animals). This is a generally accepted by most animal behavior experts that I am aware of. \n \n Of course human instincts are more along the lines of those of domestic dogs or other domestic animals, still in existance but twisted.\n \n \nWe are separated by reasoning and compassion from the other animals. Theirs is a life based on instinct and a few learned behaviors. For every example you can give me of animals protecting their own young, I can likely present an example where the males (sometimes the females) will kill the young of their species just to keep down the competition. A domestic bitch, when presented with a weakling in a litter of pups, will eat the weakling.\n\n \n Yes, a domestic bitch will eat a weak pup. Odlly enough wild dogs rarely do this (the exception is generally a pup that either will not survive or in cases weher ethere is not enough food available to sustain the enitre litter, which generally menas the pup will not survive anyway. Basically, the only time that wild dogs generally kill their own young is in the case of mercy killings).\n \n As far as learned behaviors, we are high level primates, no more, no less.\n \n \n \nThis seems to conflict with some of your earlier posts wherein you support terrorists.\n\n \n You show me the post where I said I thought terrorists killing children was a good idea and I will eat my keyboard. \n \n \n \nMan has changed significantly in the past few thousand years. I see you opted out of history classes and took it upon yourself to make up your own version.\n\n \n Oh, I know we have changed significantly. We now have the means to kill each other much more efficiently than we once did. In addition, we now have industrial capability, and the ability to destroy the entire planet a bit at a time. We can more efficiently drive lesser species to extinction. \n \n With every passing generation we become more cruel, and our ability to delude ourselves becomes ever more refined. now we kill hundreds or thousands a day with cruise missiles and bombs instead of swords and lances, or bows and clubs. Since we can now do it from thousands of miles away, we can simply pretend it is not happening and continue along in the delusion that we are \"civilized\" people. When we see low tech attacks close to home, actually smell the blood for ourselves, those who are particularly delusional (like you) bemoan the attackers as \"monsters\". \n \n Like that bitch that kills off the weak pup in her liter, we kill of tens off thousands of weaker people in the quest for dominance. When was the last time you saw a german shorthair launch cruise missles to wipe out thousands of weaker pups for the advancement of some meaningless idealogical nonsense?\n \n Next time you are sitting on your XXX in your favorite easy chair marveling at the \"accomplishments\" that have \"bettered\" the human race, while your bretheren are off killing people in order to further your idiotic ideological BS, you might keep in mind that the greatest difference between humans and animals seems to be that, while animals generally do their own killing, truly \"refined\" humans such as yourself (and most other \"civilized\" people), get to set and home and send others out to do their dirty work. \n \n True, we have invented all kinds of mralistic, idealistic mumbojumbo to convince ourselves that we are more than just squabbling apes, but at the end of the day, that is all we are. Unfortunatly, we have managed to \"refine\" our instincts to the point that they are no longer sensible or natural. We still feel the instinct to kill, and we do so more effectivley than any other species on the planet. Unlike other species, which generally kill out of need, we have no need to kill, so we invent reasons in order to satisfy our blood lust.",
