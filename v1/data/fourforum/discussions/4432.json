   "The History News Network has an interesting article about a new book entitled Historians in Trouble: Plagiarism, Fraud, and Politics in the Ivory Tower. This book talks about why some scholars get away with fraud and others don't. It lists John Lott as one of the scholars who got away with it because of powerful connections and Bellesiles as one of those who got burned for committing fraud.\n \n \"John Lott When John Lott began citing a survey he apparently never conducted, a survey he claimed proved that '98 per cent of the time that people use guns defensively, they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack,' the gun lobby protected him from criticism. The University of Chicago Press continued to feature his pro-gun book.\" \n \n \"Michael Bellesiles After winning accolades and an award for his book, Arming America, scholars discovered errors in a table and the gun lobby proceeded to destroy Bellesiles's career even though 'the critics came up with no evidence of intentional deception, no evidence of invented documents.'\"\n http://hnn.us/articles/9216.html",

   "It is an interesting looking book, for sure. Jon Wiener will have probably done a very good job ferreting out the problems with Lott's famous survey. There is a large amount of information which strongly suggests that Lott fabricated his survey. I became convinced long ago that the evidence against his survey shifted the burden to him to prove it really happened. To my knowledge, he has yet to do so. Additionally, one of the more troubling things Lott has done was to post a favorable review of his own work under the name of a fictional person, Mary Rosh (I think that was the last name he used). \n \n Still, Jon Wiener is unabashedly anti-NRA, and I expect you will find his treatment of Bellesiles very different. He has long been a public apologist for Bellesiles and his work, Arming America. Indeed, he is one of the very few people who will still publicly claim he did nothing intentionally wrong, despite the absolute mountain of evidence that suggests otherwise. As an example, try the web site I list below and read his attempt to explain away Bellesiles' conduct after he got caught citing San Francisco probate records which did not exist (because they had been destroyed in the great quake). \n \n If anyone really wants to know why Bellesiles had his Bancroft Prize stripped from him, why Emory University chastised him, and why his publisher dropped him, you can find out all you want to know, from start to finish, also at the History News Network. The site is: http://hnn.us/articles/691.html. \n \n I agree that people tend to ignore the faults and lies of those who support their views, and I know too many people on my side of the fence continue to ignore Lott's problems. But Bellesiles' problems with Arming America are as well documented as they are damning. His repeated refusal to acknowledge his problems, as well as his failed attempts to deflect criticism by shrouding himself in the cloak of David fighting an unethical NRA goliath, have won him few true believers these days (beyond Wiener).",

   "I further recommend that those who check out the site for Wiener's new book at http://hnn.us/articles/9216.html also read Prof. James Lindgren's post regarding the book and follow the links he provides there. You will learn a great deal about the scandal surrounding Arming America, and how Bellesiles was able to feed his flawed work, hook, line, and sinker, to those who overlooked its falsifications because the thesis agreed with their own personal views of gun control.\n \n A central theme to Arming America was the claim that there were very few guns around when the nation was founded. The claim is that gun ownership only became widespread after industry proved capable of mass marketing them decades later. The research Bellesiles provided in his work was quickly used to bolster the \"collective right\" view of the RKBA under the guise that if there were very few guns around at the time then the Founders must not have intended the 2nd. A to recognize an individual RKBA. Central to Bellesiles' thesis was his research into probate records of the time, in which he claimed to have found very few guns listed. The book received rave peer reviews from supporters of gun control, like Gary Wills, who said the following:\n \n \"Bellesiles has dispersed the darkness that covered the gun's early history in America. He provides overwhelming evidence that our view of the gun is as deep a superstition as any that affected Native Americans in the 17th century.\"-Garry Wills, New York Times 11. Garry Wills, Editorial, Spiking the Gun Myth, N.Y. TIMES, Sept. 10, 2000, \u00a7 7, at 5. (Wills subsequently withdrew his support for the work once Bellesiles' research came under fire, and to his credit he candidly admitted that that he had been duped by what he felt to be the plausibility of the book's thesis)\n \n Problems with Arming America were first brought forward by Clayton Cramer, who still deserves the majority of the credit for exposing problems with Bellesiles' work. However, in addition to being decidedly pro-gun, he is not a \"professional\" historian. Therefore, others who are professionals entered the fray. \n \n Prof. Lindgren is one of those. He is also someone who dislikes guns and has mostly written on the side of gun control. He attempted to reconstruct some of Bellesiles' anti-gun research into probate records in Providence, and he proved that the records Bellesiles claimed to have discovered either did not exist or, when found, showed that guns were actually plentiful despite his claims. He also cites the work of other historians (Robert Churchill, Joyce Malcom, Randolph Roth, Ira Gruber, Gloria Main, and Justin Heather) who collectively devastate Bellesiles' work.\n \n In Lindgren's post you will also see his view on the now-famous episode of Bellesiles' use of San Francisco probate records. In Arming America, Bellesiles cited probate records from San Fran which he claimed to have found in the clerk's office of the San Francisco Superior Court, but which in fact did not exist because they had been destroyed in the fire following the great quake of 1906. When that scandal broke (by the Boston Globe) Bellesiles' was unable to produce records of his research. He claimed his records were all destroyed in the now dubious and oft-changed story of the \"great Bowden Hall flood\" at Emory University, where he maintained his office. Nevertheless, Bellesiles rushed off to try and find something he could claim were San Francisco probate records to defend his research. Everywhere he went, however, he discovered that no one had copies of the destroyed records. \n \n In the end, he did find some probate records that had the words \"San Francisco\" mentioned somewhere in them. He found these records in San Fran's neighboring Contra Costa County at the Contra Costa History Center (CCHC). Although these turned out to be Contra Costa County probate records, and not San Fran records, Bellesiles nevertheless changed his story to claim that these were the San Fran records he was citing, and that he had actually found these records at the CCHC (and not the San Fran courthouse) during his original research. He then claimed he was only innocently mistaken when he cited to San Francisco probate records in Arming America. Yet, these records did not correspond to what he used in his book. Additionally, the staff at the CCHC later cast serious doubt on whether he had ever been to the Center before his hurried trip after the San Fran records issue arose. Bellesiles tried to downplay the effect of criticism from the CCHC staff by making comments that the staff was not even aware of what they had in their own library. Bellesiles' conduct so embarrassed his university that Emory sent the CCHC a formal letter of apology for his remarks. \n \n Within Lindgren's post at the http://hnn.us/articles/9216.html site you will find his discussion of this and other problems with Bellesiles' research, as well as links to two other professors' views on the San Francisco records debacle. Those professors are Jerome Sternstein (who has been very critical of Bellesiles) and Jon Wiener (who has always publicly defended Bellesiles and whose book about Bellesiles, Lott, and others is being reviewed at the HNN site).\n \n Why is any of this important? Because Bellesiles' flawed research is still being peddled in court actions, even after these problems surfaced. The most blatant use after the scandal broke was by the 9th. Circuit's majority in its opinion in Silviera v. Locklear. The majority still chose to use the research, but in light of the scandal it dropped the cite to Arming America and instead reverted to cite an original rough draft of Bellesiles' research which was published in a history journal.",

You might note, though, that in all but the first release, that section has been removed from the report. The number he uses now is lower (though I don't rmember it off the top of my head).\n \n As far as the Mary Rosh ordeal, I don't find that particularly disturbing due mainly to the fact that I am friendly with quite a few professors at our local university, and I know that most of them do the same thing. It is not uncommon. Personally, my company offers some high end software products and support forums for our users. I, as well as several of our software support guys, routinely log on to the support forums under false credentials to answer questions or help users. While his self glorification regarding teaching ability, etc... is a little creepy, I still don't see this as a major issue. \n \n \n The difference between Lotts issues and Bellisiles issues is this:\n \n Bellisiels lied about and fabricated research that was pivitol to his work. Lott did not. \n \n End of story. The 98% figure Lott uses, whether it is true or not, is irrelevant to his work. He removed the figure when it came under fire, and it did not really change his results. If you remove the questionable and fraudulent data from Bellisiles research, nothing remains.",

I do not use the 98% figure, but his statistics regarding teh relationship between firearms ownership and crime have been gone over with a fine tooth comb and found to be correct. Even the unquestioningly anti gun board from the national academies of science that was appointed by Clinton could find no fault in his work in this area. In fact, when they used his same methodology, which they found to be good, they actually got better results than Lott did, which suggests that he was fairly conservative in his number crunching.\n \n I cartainly apply the same standards to both lott and bellesiles. The difference seems to be that while only 1 line in Lotts entire report seems to be in question, I have thus far not seen a single portion of Bellisiles research that has not been discredited as fraud. If there was a single portion of Bellisiles research that was not in serious question, I think it would be acceptable for anti gunners to quote it. \n \n \nWe gunnies tend to feel weakest when we talk about the present day social costs and benefits of firearms, and I think we are too willing to accept studies that support our position in this area.

Too many of them (like Wiener and Wills) were willing to blindly wield Bellesiles' work as a sword of truth.\n\n \n Personally, I have no trouble with the social cost of firearms ownersip. First, when you break down firearms deaths as a percentage of overall population, they are negligible. Gun control is a solution looking for a problem. Second, I find the antigunners \"solution\" in regards to the social cost to be highly illogical. I find it very unlikely that those who intend to use their firearms in a criminal manner are likely to change their minds regardless of what laws we have passed. If the problem is criminal use of firearms, it is illogical to believe that we can simply pass a new and better law to solve it, since by definition a criminal is somebody who does not obey the law. \n \n Passing more laws to control guns will only affect those who are inclined to obey them. Law abiding citizens do not seem to be the problem here.\n \n \nIn the end, if we apply the same level of scrutiny, then I think we will find that Bellesiles' historical sins are far greater than Lott's contemporary ones.

I almost ordered it, then decided against it, at least temporarily. I can not help but wonder if I really need to read it, since I know Weiner's past work, and I pretty much know what the new book is going to say. Basically, we can expect it to say \"Academic dishonesty which promotes a totalitarian socialist viewpoint is acceptable, but academic dishonesty that does not should be brought to light and the guilty parties crucified in the public square\". I know this becuase that is pretty much what all of Weiner's \"work\" says in the end. God fearing freedom lovers BAD......Godless communists GOOD.",

William Colglazier of the National Academy of Sciences and National Research Council says differently-\n \n \nA Lott of misinformation\n The recent column by John Lott about the National Research Council's project and report on improving scientific information and data on firearms [''Mountain of evidence shows gun control doesn't work,'' commentary, Jan. 8] contained significant errors. The NRC is the operating arm of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. In composing the committee, the NRC ensured that all areas of relevant scientific expertise for the task were represented. In addition, committee members reported a wide diversity of experiences with guns. The draft membership was posted on the Web for public comment, and it was made final only after a careful review of public comments and an internal process to vet any potential conflicts of interest.\n The committee's report underwent an extensive review and evaluation by 11 nationally recognized experts whose names were not known to the committee until the report was published. Because of the rigor of our process, the Research Council has achieved a reputation for objectivity and integrity. \n Lott's column gave the clear impression that the study was about gun control. It was not. The study was about the quality of the data and research on firearms injury and violence. These data and studies are frequently used by both sides in the debate on gun control. It was the committee's task to make judgments about the quality of this scientific knowledge. The committee was not asked and does not offer any conclusions or comments on gun control policy. \n The column states that the panel ignored most of the studies that find a benefit in crime reduction from right-to-carry laws. The report contains an entire chapter and three appendixes that address the rather large literature on these laws. The report cites both studies that do find positive effects and studies that do not find positive effects. On the basis of the very mixed evidence, the panel concluded that there was no basis for a conclusion that the passage of right-to-carry laws either increases or decreases crime. \n Firearms violence is a serious problem in the United States. The committee's call for better data and research reflects that thoroughly documented fact.\n E.

It says that lotts ascertation that the comitee was tasked with making findings related to gun control were incorrect. \n \n \nLott's column gave the clear impression that the study was about gun control. It was not. The study was about the quality of the data and research on firearms injury and violence. These data and studies are frequently used by both sides in the debate on gun control. It was the committee's task to make judgments about the quality of this scientific knowledge. The committee was not asked and does not offer any conclusions or comments on gun control policy. \n \n \n Even if his statement here was factual (which it is not) it still makes clear that my above statement was correct. According to Colglazier, their task was to \"make judgments about the quality of this scientific knowledge\". This is exactly what they did. They examined his methodology used by lott and declared it to be scientifically acceptable. They used his methodology, which they had already accepted as legitimate, and ran their own experiment as a control set, and came up with better results than Lott had. \n \n Now, why the letter cannot possibly be factual:\n \n You will note that he says:\n \n \nIt was the committee's task to make judgments about the quality of this scientific knowledge. The committee was not asked and does not offer any conclusions or comments on gun control policy. \n \n \n The very next statment includes:\n \n \nOn the basis of the very mixed evidence, the panel concluded that there was no basis for a conclusion that the passage of right-to-carry laws either increases or decreases crime. \n \n \n What he is saying is \"we draw no conclusions\", then in the very next section he is explaining the conclusions they drew. \n \n It is interesting to note that of all the studies they looked at regarding the relationship between concealed carry and crime, Lotts is the ONLY one that passed without criticism. \n \n So, if we trust the NAS, despite the fact that even the anti gunners do not argue that the panel was not anti gun, we find that there is \"no basis for a conclusion that the passage of right-to-carry laws either increases or decreases crime.\"\n \n This would seem to shoot rather large holes in the anti gunners argument against right to carry laws and concealed carry in general. If there is \"no basis for a conclusion that the passage of right-to-carry laws either increases or decreases crime\", then there is no reason not to pass right to carry laws. The anti gunners rediculous arguments have now been rendered VOID by their own people. \n \n Before Lotts work, pro gunner tended to quote Kleck, who concluded that there was no net effect to concealed carry laws, since the \"harm\" caused by such laws was equally balanced with the \"good\".\n \n Now we use lotts work, since it is probably the most scrutinized piece of research on the subject ever, andis the only one to never have serious doubts cast on its results. Sure there is some nitpicking out there, and a couple of bentally unbalanced folks (like Tim Lambert) who wish the results were not as they are, or who wish that Lott had been better at chart creation, but at the end of the day, his work and conclusions have never been discredited, or even cast into serious doubt.",

   "And yet no other portion of lotts work has been refuted. His methodology has been scrutinized and found to be legitimate. YET, you are willing to completely disregard his work because of an unrelated comment?\n \n\n I think his research is questionable not only because of that comment but also because of the criticisms of other researchers. \n \n \n\n The data that has been specifically and publicly discredited by a comittee in a public forum has been removed. The problem is that EVERY piece of data thus far scrutinized has been found to be lacking. If they had checked 10 things and found 5 of them to be lacking, that would be one thing. If you check 10 things and find every one of them to be not only lacking, but in most cases completely false, including in many instances complete fabrications, you are looking at a whole new ball game.\n\n But they checked the pieces of data that Bellesiles had received the greatest amount criticism for.

   "I don't know Tim Lambert. I don't know who he is or what his real motivations are. I try to keep to a policy of seeing what the critic says. I don't want to kill the message because I didn't trust the messenger (or, more appropriately, I don't want to attack the messenger because I want to discredit the message I do not like). Is Tim Lambert obsessed with Lott? I don't know. Is he any more obsessed with Lott than, say, Clayton Cramer has been with Bellesiles? I don't know. The question for me is can the critic support his argument? If it's there, then it's there. If it ain't, then it ain't. \n \n I went through a lengthy argument with a blind supporter of Bellesiles who tried at every turn to discredit what was being said about him. He ignored the truth and argued that the critics were part of a vast NRA conspiracy. Hypocrasy and double-think ran rampart in the defense of Bellesiles. The Emory investigative committee is a good example of this. The investigative committee's task was to focus on a very narrow portion of his work. Bellesiles' supporters claimed that this was evidence of some conspiracy to get him, and they were sharply critical of the narrow focus of the investigation. Once the investigation was completed, however, they then sought to claim (and this is from Wiener himself) that the only thing the committee could find wrong with the book was \"a few paragraphs in a 400 page book.\" Well, sure. The committee never looked at the rest of the book. You can't criticize an investigation as being too narrowly focused on a small portion of a book, and then turn around and credibly claim that the report cleared the remainder of the book. \n \n In truth, there is far more wrong with Bellesiles' work beyond his inventing sources that either did not exist or said the opposite of what he claims they said. If the Emory Committee had looked farther into Arming America, then it would have found other problems as well. Other historians have. Bellesiles' Arming America really boils down to this: It reads as if you are reading the report of his observations of a crowded cocktail party he attended, where all he did was look over the heads of all the guests to find his few friends; and when his friends disagreed with him, he chose to later quote them as if they did agree with him. In my opinion, the only reason why he got the Bancroft award in the first place was because his work supported gun control and was thus afforded a pass on critical review. It was only after the verifiable problems with Arming America reached critical mass that the Bancroft prize committee had to act and revoke his award. You don't have to take my word for it. Go to the HNN site and judge it for yourself. http://hnn.us/articles/691.html#latest\n \n It is true that \"there is still a book left.\" Bellesiles has published a \"corrected\" second edition of Arming America after his original publishing house, Knopf, dropped him. His new publisher is a small uber-liberal publishing house called 'Soft Skull Press.\" You can view their site here: http://www.softskull.com/index.php. You will find the new edition of Arming America alongside such classics from Soft Skull like \"Kings and Queens, XXXXXX at the Prom,\" \"Confronting Capitalism (The Battle of Seattle),\" \"What the F-k, The Avant Porn Anthology,\" \"Yes, you are a Revolutionary!\", and \"Our Enemies in Blue.\" I say this: Ignore the trash that surrounds the book, and the motives of the new publisher for producing a second edition. Get a copy of each edition, and read what the historians have said about both.",

When the crime rate dropped slower than this assumption predicted it should, Donohue and Ayres referred to the difference as an \"increase\" in crime.\n \n \"It's only when they use this kind of 'artificial specification' that simplifies this do they get a bad result,\" Lott explained. \"A better way of doing it is by looking at the crime rates year by year, for one year after the law, two years, three years - and when you do that, even their own results get an immediate drop that continues to fall after that.\"\n\n \n \n\"There seems to be almost no benefit from concealed handguns,\" Donohue told CNSNews.com Monday - but he immediately retracted the claim.\n \n \"Actually, I can't say that.

   "\"Out of curiousity, and since you are a lawyer, when you were in law school did they teach the collective rights view? How did they get around the historical questions, or did they even bother?\"\n \n I came out of law school in 1993. Sadly, the Second Amendment was ignored in my constitutional law class. All law professors have the ability to structure their curriculum, but I think the 2nd. Amendment is largely ignored in law schools because there is just not a lot of law out there on it (in the sense of current give and take changes like you see with the 4th. Amendment or, more recently, the 8th. and juvenile capital crimes). No one I know who is a lawyer can remember the Second Amendment getting any serious discussion as part of their con law classes. I remember our focus in con law (as far as the BoR was concerned) was on the 1st, 4th., 5th., 6th., 8th. 9th., and 10th. The 2nd. only became discussed as part of Justice Black's theory that the 14th. totally incorporated the BoR as enforceable against the states. \n \n I did get a lot of history on our civil liberties in law school, and the 2nd. was mentioned there as an individual right we inherited from English tradition (principally, from the English Bill of Rights, which arose from the \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688 against the Catholic restoration monarchy). Here is an archived quote of that document:\n \n \"That the raising or keeping of standing armies in the kingdom in time of peace, unless it be with the consent of parliament, is against law.\"\n \"That the subjects which are protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law.\"  \n \n Here is an archived quote from Blackstone explaining how the RKBA contained in that document was interpreted:\n \n \"The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall present mention, is that of having arms for their defense, suitable to their condition and degree and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the same statute W & M st. 2.c.2. [ie. The Bill of Rights] and it is indeed a public allowance under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression. In these several articles consist the rights, or as they are frequently termed, the liberties of Englishmen. . . .\n And we have seen that these rights. . .consist, primarily, in the free enjoyment of personal security, of personal liberty, and of private property. So long as these remain inviolate, the subject is perfectly free; for every species of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act in opposition to one or other of these rights. To preserve these from violation, it is necessary that the constitution of parliaments be supported in it[s] full vigor. . . .And lastly, to vindicate these rights, when actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in the first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the courts of law; next to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances; and lastly, to the right of having and using arms for self preservation and defense.\" Sir William Blackstone, 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England, p. 136 & 140 (1st. ed. 1765, reprinted 1979). \n \n I know that in 1999 Lawrence Tribe of Harvard (whose American Constitutional Law is probably still the most used con law textbook in Law Schools) finally addressed the 2nd. Amendment as recognizing an individual right. I got this from a USA today article I also have archived quotes from. Tribe is alleged in the article to view the 2nd. RKBA as a right to \"possess and use firearms in the defense of themselves and their homes.\"  He is alleged to say it is \"admittedly of uncertain scope,\"  but to say further that \"the federal government may not disarm individual citizens without some unusually strong justification.\"  From the article Scholar's shift in thinking angers liberals, by Tony Mauro, published in USA TODAY, August 27, 1999. These quotes were e-mailed to me with the cite by somebody else. I don't have access to a post-1999 Tribe textbook, so I can't conclusively claim this is what he still says. I can't even remember who wrote my con law textbook, but I think it's still buried in storage in my garage. I'll see if I can't dig it out and see what it says.\n \n ------------------------\n \n \"How miserable that man is who governs a people when six parts of seaven at least are Poore Endebted Discontented and Armed.\"  Sir William Berkley, Royal Governor of Virginia, who survivied the brief and ill-fated \"Bacon's rebellion\" of 1676.

But that would also probably depend on each state constitution. \n \n \n You might be interested in reading Tim Lambert's rebuttal of that article.\n Look for \"Biased reporting from CNSNews\"\n http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/cgi-bin/blog/2003/05/14\n \n \n What is my background in statistics? Well I learned about it as a university student and then later read a book on it to refresh my memory. I also conducted my own research project and had to use statistics with the data that I had collected.\n If you are going to make claims then support them. Tim Lambert's undergraduate major was math so I don't think his background in statistics is \"completely non-existant\". \n It seems to me that your claims about who is not an expert has been based on questionable evidence. Go ahead and start another thread about that study if you like.\n \n \n You might regret making all those claims. I think you'd have a hard time finding many historians that support your views, but that can be another thread. Read on-\n\n \n Do you rememer who said this in regards in Michael Bellisiles?\n \n \"It does not matter if he cooked the data\" - ?\n \n Or something to that effect?",
