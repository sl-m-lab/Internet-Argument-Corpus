Gay rights proponents are just as free to fight for their own amendment, and it would be more in keeping with constitutional precedent anyway than just looking for any loophole/it's-a-stretch excuse possible to invalidate the vote. (After all, constitutional amendments are, historically, mostly how other rights have been guaranteed in the USC when issues came up that hadn't been allowed previously).

   "Jyoshu, I said MULTIPLE times BEFORE the vote that I thought it was inherently wrong to over-ride the Supreme Court's recognition of CONSTITUTIONAL rights with a simple majority as \"wrong\".\n\n \n And you would be wrong. They weren't voting on anything by the supreme court. They were simply voting on amending the constitution. Look, the whole \"revision\" thing is just a semantics strategy thrown out there to try and find a way around it. You and I both know it's a tactic thing.\n \n \nIf anything, maybe your side should answer questions as to why they chose the wrong methodology for amending the constitution.\n\n \n Sorry, but it only takes a majority vote to amend the constitution of CA. \n \n Also, don't start the \"your side\" junk again. If I lived in CA, I wouldn't have voted for it at all. But don't try something underhanded to get around things just because the vote didn't go your way. The only 'side' I'm taking here is that the process go forward as the RULES allow for--Something you're trying to circumvent by the whole \"revision\" as opposed to \"amendment\" tactic.\n \n \nWhile we have instituted some democratic traditions, that doesn't mean anything is being \"undercut\" when we play by the rules.\n Our founding fathers HAD A REASON for why they made us a \"constitutional republic\" instead of a \"democracy\" first and foremost.\n\n \n What's interesting is that apparently NOTHING would ever qualify for being a 'democracy' with such a standard as the one you're putting forth here. You're putting forth a false delimma here to begin with. Do you not understand that being a constitutional republic doesn't DISQUALIFY the U.S. as being a democracy? (I know you understand this concept, because you harped on it over and over in making a big deal about people not being prejudiced just because they are religious. Interesting that you're using the same sort of thing that you argued as being fallacious in a different thread.) I'm curious ... at what point WOULD a government qualify for a bona fide democracy, in your thinking? Because it's not like the presence of a constitution means it's NOT a democracy. These are not COMPETING concepts. What makes it a democracy is that the government is chosen by the people. From Wikipedia:\n \n \"In contemporary usage, the term democracy refers to a government chosen by the people, whether it is direct or representative.\"emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nIt's like purposely showing up for a school trip without the proper consent form, hoping that the teachers will be swayed to let you go anyways.\n\n \n More like the teacher trying to claim the note isn't valid if it's typed, claiming \"it's not REALLY a note\" to begin with, so it doesn't count. :) Or if it's long and in the format of a letter, trying to get out of accepting it by saying \"that's not a note, that's a letter, and rules say you have to have a \"note.\" Sorry, can't take it.\" That's what's happening here with the whole \"revision\"-not-\"amendment\" strategy you're using. Trying to invalidate it on a technicality, when most everyone had full understanding it was for the purpose of AMENDING.",

It is derived from the Greek &#948;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#945; ([dimokratia] (help\u00b7info)), \"popular government\"[1] which was coined from &#948;&#942;&#956;&#959;&#962; (d&#275;mos), \"people\" and &#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#962; (kratos), \"rule, strength\" in the middle of the 5th-4th century BC to denote the political systems then existing in some Greek city-states, notably Athens following a popular uprising in 508 BC.[2] In this form, there were no defined human rights or legal restraints upon the actions of assembly, making it the first instance of \"illiberal democracy.\"[3]\n \n In political theory, democracy describes a small number of related forms of government and also a political philosophy. Even though there is no universally accepted definition of 'democracy',[4] there are two principles that any definition of democracy includes. The first principle is that all members of the society have equal access to power and the second that all members enjoy universally recognized freedoms and liberties.[5][6][7]The U.S. government violates the \"first principle\" in multiple ways. An electoral vote is much more powerful than my vote. A senator's vote is much more powerful than my individual vote.\n We are a REPUBLIC: \"a government in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and governing according to law\"\n \n \n \nMore like the teacher trying to claim the note isn't valid if it's typed, claiming \"it's not REALLY a note\" to begin with, so it doesn't count.\n\n No.\n The \"revision\" / \"amendment\" requirements existed long before Prop 8 ever existed.\n This is not a meaningless formality.\n \n Look.\n Are you even going to try to understand what the point is or should I just count on you to try to obfuscate this the entire way through?\n \n \n \nOr if it's long and in the format of a letter, trying to get out of accepting it by saying \"that's not a note, that's a letter, and rules say you have to have a \"note.\" Sorry, can't take it.\" That's what's happening here with the whole \"revision\"-not-\"amendment\" strategy you're using.\n\n Your reply tries to trivialize the difference, which I am fairly convinced you do not understand.\n Do you understand the difference between \"revision\" and \"amendment\"?\n Do you acknowledge this LEGAL difference existed long before Prop 8?\n \n It's not an issue of just \"not long enough\".\n I would say it's more accurate that on some field trips (like to the spelling bee), a parent's signature is required.\n But on other field trips (like on a boating expedition) more significant and explicit waivers of responsibility are required to be signed that are not relevant in example #1.\n \n \n \nTrying to invalidate it on a technicality, when most everyone had full understanding it was for the purpose of AMENDING.\n\n Again, you throw that word around \"amending\" like you don't understand the significance of the difference between the PHILOSOPHIES behind \"amending\" and \"revision\".\n It's like you're trying to argue against the \"greenhouse effect\" by arguing that greenhouses are good for plants.\n You are abusing the terminology, possibly on purpose or possibly because you haven't taken the time to truly understand the issue.",

   "That's your opinion, conflicting with my opinion.\n Except on my side, I have more than just \"my opinion\". The federal government has specific requirements for \"amendments\" in place. Requirements which mandate more than just a simple majority.\n Moreover, the California constitution itself includes two separate requirements for changing the state constitution. One of them, in cases of a more significant change, requires MORE than just a simple majority.\n\n \n How does prop 8 \"change\" the constitution? The wording of the CA state constitution hasn't been changed. Nothing is CHANGED. The only difference is that it's been added to--in other words, it has been amended. Majority vote.\n \n I understand your frustration with having lost on this. I'd probably be frustrated as well that it only takes a majority vote if I were on the losing end. But that's the rules regarding amending, and if you feel that's a problem, then due process has to be followed to change those rules. You can't just invalidate it because you PHILOSOPHICALLY think it's too serious of an issue to be called an 'amendment'. Anyone on the losing end of an anemdment fight is going to claim what you're claiming; If people know that calling something a 'revision' rather than an 'amendment' would change whether it gets passed or not, and they're on the losing end, then they'll naturally take up the tactic you're taking up. But you have to prove your point; you say it's 'debatable'; so debate it. The idea it's an amendment is the STANDARD here; you're the one with the burden of changing this to be a REVISION issue. (A tough task, given that the constitution isn't being changed, but added to.) I suspect the opposers of the federal-level 18th amendment probably wanted to find some way to invalidate it or change the situation to where the vote didn't effectively pass. But in the end, they had to follow the process and it took another amendment to 'undo' it. \n \n \nIn what bizarre misrepresentation of the English language is that in any sense even partially true?\n Prop 8 wouldn't have existed if it weren't for the California Supreme Court decision. It was a DIRECT response to the California Supreme Court decision.\n\n \n Happening in a chain of events isn't the same as the concept of voting on the SCOCA's ruling. They were voting on amending the constitution. You're right that it wouldn't be an issue had the SCOCA not ruled the way it did, but if they hadn't ruled the way they did you wouldn't have gay marriage there ANYWAY. \n \n \nNo. I don't think it's a \"tactic\" thing.\n\n \n Then you're woefully naive. Do you seriously think this would have been taken up if gays had NOT lost the prop 8 amendment fight? No way. \n \n \nWhat you don't seem to realize is that this \"revision\" requirement existed long before the Prop 8 ballot vote, and it will exist long after Prop 8 has been decided.\n\n \n I do realize that. But only after losing this is THIS particular vote being called a 'revision' by all these people that ... quite honestly, simply want gay marriage to be a reality--their REAL motivation. No one seemed to care prior to the vote.\n \n \nTo CHANGE the California state constitution, there are TWO SEPARATE methods.\n\n \n Again, how is adding to something, without changing the wording that WAS ALREADY THERE, a 'change'?\n \n \nDo you understand the differences between \"republic\" and \"democracy\"?\n\n \n Do you understand that something can be a republic and STILL be a democracy? That those two aren't competing concepts in this case?\n \n Let's review this.\n [*]No one is saying it's 'NOT a republic.'[*]You ARE saying it's 'not a democracy.'[*]To argue against it being a democracy, your basis is to say over and over that 'it's a republic.'[*]Yet in point of fact, to be republic doesn't mean it's not a democracy.Not competing concepts. You've completely broken down in terms of logical process here.\n \n And frankly, what's the difference in saying a state engages in \"democratic traditions\", from just calling them a 'democracy' to a degree? To say 'democratic traditions' is just an attempt at a watered down way of saying it's a form of democracy (without actually having to say it). How is something with \"democratic tendencies\" NOT a democracy, effectively? What the heck makes a state with \"democratic tendencies\" NOT effectively a 'democracy' anyway? It seems you are making semantic distinctions here that are pretty meaningless, really. \n \n \n[4] there are two principles that any definition of democracy includes. The first principle is that all members of the society have equal access to power....\n\n \n Right ... That's why you have ACCESS to state representative and senators. It DOESN'T mean you're supposed to have the same POWER as a senator, for instance. \n \n \nThe U.S. government violates the \"first principle\" in multiple ways. An electoral vote is much more powerful than my vote. A senator's vote is much more powerful than my individual vote.\n\n \n Do you realize, by the ridiculous standards you're applying in the way you're interpreting those comments on wikipedia, ANY (again, ANY) government which has senators or other forms of representatives can NEVER be called a democracy to any degree??? Because it's ALWAYS going to be able to be said that a representative is going to carry more POWER than those they represent. By your view, a democracy to any degree is perhaps the rarest form of government, and quite possibly has NEVER existed ANYWHERE. I really do think your view is very much out of what would be most any reasonable view on this, by a long shot. \n \n \nWe are a REPUBLIC\n\n \n Yes, we are. No one is saying otherwise.\n \n So CLAFCLOW, or whatever it's called.\n \n No one is saying we aren't a REPUBLIC. YOU ARE saying we aren't a democracy. \n \n The premise that they are competing concepts, by any default sense whatsoever, is ridiculous, quite frankly.\n \n \nAgain, you throw that word around \"amending\" like you don't understand the significance of the difference between the PHILOSOPHIES behind \"amending\" and \"revision\".\n\n \n Ah yes. \"Philosophy\". \n \n And there it is. \n \n The eye of the beholder as a concept makes it's debut again. \n \n How about telling everyone what your 'philosophy' is on those terms--or at least what you THINK is the philosophy of law. (which is, of course, your opinion.)",

   "How does prop 8 \"change\" the constitution? The wording of the CA state constitution hasn't been changed. Nothing is CHANGED. The only difference is that it's been added to--in other words, it has been amended. Majority vote.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n You are quibbling over meaningless semantics.\n You ask \"How does prop 8 \"change\" the constitution?\"\n Under the previous constitution, gay marriage was a right.\n Under the \"amended\" constitution, gay marriage is not a right.\n That is a change.\n \n \n \nI understand your frustration with having lost on this. I'd probably be frustrated as well that it only takes a majority vote if I were on the losing end. But that's the rules regarding amending, and if you feel that's a problem, then due process has to be followed to change those rules.\n\n Actually, I AM TALKING about the rules.\n You don't seem to be listening.\n There are different voting requirements for a constitutional \"revision\" vs a constitutional \"amendment\".\n Please educate yourself before proceeding further, cause otherwise it's like trying to talk quantum mechanics to an average car mechanic...\n \n \n \nYou can't just invalidate it because you PHILOSOPHICALLY think it's too serious of an issue to be called an 'amendment'.\n\n Actually, YOU CAN.\n Did you even bother to look at the other thread I linked you to?\n Your replies indicate the answer is \"no\".\n \n \n \nIf people know that calling something an 'revision' rather than an 'amendment' would change whether it gets passed or not, and they're on the losing end, then they'll take up the tactic you're taking up.\n\n You're not even arguing the issue.\n You're just trying to elaborate on what sides are present.\n \n \n \nBut you have to prove your point...\n\n The argument has already been laid out.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/11930-prop-8-revision-amendment.html\n \n You are refusing to address the ACTUAL ARGUMENTS at hand.\n \n \n \n(A tough task, given that the constitution isn't being changed, but added to.)\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n Can you admit you just made that standard up?\n Please. Either give legal precedent for your argument, or admit the answer to the above question is \"Yes\".\n \n I am talking about the EXISTING LEGAL PRECEDENT, and you are talking about some ridiculous \"standard\" which doesn't exist.\n \n \n \nHappening in a chain of events isn't the same as the concept of voting on the SCOCA's ruling. They were voting on amending the constitution. You're right that it wouldn't be an issue had the SCOCA not ruled the way it did, but if they hadn't ruled the way they did you wouldn't have gay marriage there ANYWAY.\n\n Again, you're quibbling over semantics, and the differentiation is essentially pointless.\n Riddle me this. Suppose I were to hypothetically agree with you here.\n Would it mean ANYTHING AT ALL regarding the overall arguments being made?\n Naw. Didn't think so... emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nThen you're woefully naive. Do you seriously think this have been taken up if gays had NOT lost the prop 8 amendment fight? No way.\n\n CLAFCLO.\n I never said anything about \"thinking this would have been taken up if gays had lost the prop 8 amendment\".\n Furthermore, this line of comment you are making is thoroughly useless.\n Again, it doesn't address the main issue.\n It doesn't make any significant point.\n If you think it does, then please (without moving the goal-posts) explain WHAT the significance of your point is...\n \n \n \nI do realize that. But only after losing this is THIS particular vote being called a 'revision' by all these people that ... quite honestly, simply want gay marriage to be a reality--their REAL motivation.\n\n Their real motivation in \"simply wanting gay marriage\"?\n Imagine that!\n \n \n \nNo one seemed to care prior to the vote.\n\n Already addressed.\n 1) It would be pointless to clog the courts with such procedural challenges on bills that were not going to pass in the first place.\n 2) This IS HOW WE DO BUSINESS. If you can show me any legislation whose constitutionality and procedural methodology was challenged BEFORE the vote, I welcome you to do so.\n 3) Yeah. I was just talking to hear myself talk when I echoed this exact same sentiment before the vote... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nAgain, how is adding to something, without changing the wording that WAS ALREADY THERE, a 'change'?\n\n Please review what the REAL difference between \"revision\" and \"amendment\" means.\n It's pointless for you to just make up junk and pretend you know what you're talking about.\n \n \n \nDo you understand that something can be a republic and STILL be a democracy? That those two aren't competing concepts in this case?\n\n Did I claim they were?\n You're trying to drag this into a discussion on \"government\" that has ABSOLUTELY NO POINT towards the actual topic at hand.\n \n \n \nLet's review this.[*]No one is saying it's 'NOT a republic.'[*]You ARE saying it's 'not a democracy.'[*]To argue against it being a democracy, your basis is to say over and over that 'it's a republic.'[*]Yet in point of fact, to be republic doesn't mean it's not a democracy.\n\n This is just a stupid falsehood.\n Either you were too lazy to recognize my argument, or too deceitful to accurately relay it.\n You brought up wikipedia. You gave ONE SENTENCE out of the whole article to pretend you had a point.\n I used your article to make an argument you now pretend didn't exist.\n  Democracy is a form of government in which power is held by people under a free electoral system. It is derived from the Greek &#948;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#945; ([dimokratia] (help\u00b7info)), \"popular government\"[1] which was coined from &#948;&#942;&#956;&#959;&#962; (d&#275;mos), \"people\" and &#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#962; (kratos), \"rule, strength\" in the middle of the 5th-4th century BC to denote the political systems then existing in some Greek city-states, notably Athens following a popular uprising in 508 BC.[2] In this form, there were no defined human rights or legal restraints upon the actions of assembly, making it the first instance of \"illiberal democracy.\"[3]\n \n In political theory, democracy describes a small number of related forms of government and also a political philosophy. Even though there is no universally accepted definition of 'democracy',[4] there are two principles that any definition of democracy includes. The first principle is that all members of the society have equal access to power and the second that all members enjoy universally recognized freedoms and liberties.[5][6][7]\n \n \nAnd frankly, what's the difference in saying a state engages in \"democratic traditions\", from just calling them a 'democracy' to a degree?\n\n A pointless difference?\n Again, you reply with meaningless commentary irrelevant to the topic...\n \n \n \nRight ... That's why you have ACCESS to state representative and senators. It DOESN'T mean you're supposed to have the same POWER as a senator, for instance.\n\n Meaningless semantics.\n Does my vote have the same power as a senators?\n \n You talk about \"supposed to have the same power as a senator\", and you've completely moved the goal-posts from the football field to the water polo section.\n I gave an explanation (which you earlier pretended didn't exist, as you now reply to it by AVOIDING THE HEART of the issue) on why our system is not a democracy.\n You refuse to address it, so I'm moving on...\n \n \n \nDo you realize, by the ridiculous standards you're applying in the way you're interpreting those comments on wikipedia, ANY (again, ANY) government which has senators or other forms of representatives can NEVER be called a democracy to any degree???\n\n CLAFCLO.\n Quote me where I said \"can never be called a democracy to any degree\".\n \n \n \nYes, we are. No one is saying otherwise.\n So CLAFCLOW, or whatever it's called.\n\n Again, you abuse the term.\n I never intimated you were saying we weren't a Republic.\n I was making a point to make sure it was understood.\n Cause you see, you have this habit of ignoring my REAL arguments and the REAL substance of the issue...\n \n \n \nThe premise that they are competing concepts, by any default sense whatsoever, is ridiculous, quite frankly.\n\n One requires all people have equal voting power.\n The other implements a system where delegates have voting power, vastly superior to the individual citizens.\n They are competing concepts.\n \n \n \nAh yes. \"Philosophy\". \n And there it is. \n The eye of the beholder as a concept makes it's debut again. \n\n Jyoshu, you obviously are willing to argue out of ignorance.\n I invite others who want to see the REAL issues at hand to review them, and not get confused by Jyoshu's obfuscation.\n \n Cause you see, once again Jyoshu is trying hard not to admit that I am not talking about JUST MY OPINION, but rather I am citing LEGAL PRECEDENT and EXISTING LAW.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/11930-prop-8-revision-amendment.html\n \n Jyoshu on the other hand is making up definitions and pretending that his claim of \"changing\" the constitution is somehow the distinguishing factor.\n He obviously doesn't want to address the REAL issue, and is now trying to make \"democracy vs republic\" as a more important factor.\n ESPECIALLY since he has nothing to back up his \"changing the constitution\" claim as the distinguishing feature between \"amendment\" and \"revision\".",

   "But surely, you claim that there is only one god. If Lucifer is a god, then that would make two. Besides which, as you stated, \"If they worship a false god\", so all you have to do now is prove that they are worshipping false gods, or for that matter that there are any gods at all. Good luck!\n\n \n You really need to study up on scriptural terminology and methodology smiley. You'll find that I always refer to God, large G now look back at my reference to Lucifer as the god of this world, small g; he is not a creator god as the maker of all that is, is. He is a fallen angel with powers over the elements and this world, and his mission is to destroy humanity. Here is the doctrine of satan. It will inform you of his character and mission as the most powerful enemy of God in this Age. Here's an excerpt of the link: \n Satan's influence in worldly affairs is also clearly revealed (John 12:31). His various titles reflect his control of the world system: \"the ruler of this world\" (John 12:31), \"the god of this age\" (2 Cor 4:4), and \"the prince of the power of the air\" (Eph 2:2). The Bible declares, \"The whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one\" (1 John 5:19).\n \n Satan exercises his evil power through demons (Matt 12:24; 25:41; Rev 12:7,9). An outburst of demonic activity occurred when Jesus came to earth the first time because of the Savior's attack against Satan's kingdom (Matt 12:28-29; Acts 10:38). Another such outburst is expected just before the second coming of Christ, because this will bring about the downfall of Satan and his angels (Rev 9:3-17; 12:12; 18:2).\n \n Satan also has high intelligence. Through it he deceived Adam and Eve and took over their rule of the world for himself (Gen 1:26; 3:1-7; 2 Cor 11:3). His cleverness enables him to carry out his deceptive work almost at will.\n \n Yet Satan's attributes, impressive as they are, are not limitless. His power is subject to God's restrictions (Job 1:12; Luke 4:6; 2 Thess 2:7-8). The reins of God on his activities are illustrated by Satan's request to God for permission to afflict Job (Job 1:7-12).\n \n Satan is permitted to afflict God's people (Luke 13:16; 1 Thess 2:18; Heb 2:14). But he is never permitted to win an ultimate victory over them (John 14:30-31; 16:33).\n \n A part of Satan's continuing ambition to replace God is his passionate yearning to have others worship him (Matt 4:8-9; Rev 13:4,12). Since God has frustrated this desire and put down Satan's rebellion, he has become God's exact opposite. He is \"the wicked one\" (Matt 13:19,38), while God is \"the Holy One\" (Isa 1:4).\n \n Satan's nature is malicious. His efforts in opposing God, His people, and His truth are tireless (Job 1:7; 2:2; Matt 13:28). He is always opposed to man's best interests (1 Chron 21:1; Zech 3:1-2). Through his role in introducing sin into the human family (Gen 3), Satan has gained the power of death-a power which Christ has broken through His crucifixion and resurrection (Heb 2:14-15)Doctrine of Satan\n \n \nSo now you are quoting the book of 4?\n\n \n 2 Corinthians 4:4 The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.\n \n \n \nProve he exists (or even provide one piece of solid evidence), and I will happily follow your beliefs to the ends of the earth.\n \n Would a simpleton be more likely to believe or disbelieve something that has zero evidence to back it up?\n \n And as I have made no fallacious statements on this thread, your fictional refutation must be of your usual imaginary standard.\n\n \n WOW, are you telling me that you need evidence that true and unrepentant evil exists in this world? I have said before to no avail that humanity is in a spiritual battle against the forces of darkness. For those who don't believe this, they will be the DOAs in the aftermath of this war, having never even put up a fight since they never even believed that the enemy exists. Here is how the bible puts it.\n Eph 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high [places].\n If you expect me to show you a photo of satan, you're out of luck. It takes some personal discernment and insight to recognize the evidence of his handiwork. Something the unregenerate don't usually have which explains why you're blind to the realities which I so clearly see. \n \n It's incredible I know, but although we live on the same planet, we literally live in different worlds. I see this world through spiritual eyes which allows me to see the darkness, lies and evil within it, and that it is all a result of the spiritual battle which is never ending since demons don't sleep or take vacations. But all you see are the actions of men with no explanation that goes deeper than they did what they did for whatever reasons which motivated them to do it. \n \n So I don't know what evidence you expect, because I thought the existence and presence of evil was obvious to everyone.",

   "emoticon_frazzled\n You are quibbling over meaningless semantics.\n\n \n Hey, you're the one here trying to change 'amendment' to 'revision.' Talk about 'semantics'.\n \n \nYou ask \"How does prop 8 \"change\" the constitution?\"\n Under the previous constitution, gay marriage was a right.\n \n Under the \"amended\" constitution, gay marriage is not a right.\n That is a change.\n\n \n So, by that logic, then the 18 amendment was an invalid amendment and it should have been invalidated to begin with to the point where the 21st amendment wasn't needed? After all, there's nothing in the constitution that SPECIFIES 'gay marriage' is a right, just as there was nothing in the federal constitution that specified 'drinking alcohol is a right.' So I don't think you realize how your view on this ISN'T precedent at all, and in fact goes against precedent.\n \n \nThere are different voting requirements for a constitutional \"revision\" vs a constitutional \"amendment\".\n Please educate yourself before proceeding further, cause otherwise it's like trying to talk quantum mechanics to an average car mechanic...\n\n \n CLAFCLOW. Yes, I realise there are different voting requirements for each; please don't argue against something I'm not even arguing. You STILL need to prove how this is really a revision rather than an amendment. \n \n Also, don't think your latest lame tactic of just asserting \"you don't know what you're talking about\" every time you get an argument hasn't gone unnoticed. I could just as feasibly say you need to educate YOURself because your standards on what is a 'revision' versus 'amendment' seem to be pretty ridiculous, frankly, and arbitrary to boot. (Quite convenient that they happen to coincide exactly with what you need them to be for the vote to not be able to pass! :p)\n \n \nDid you even bother to look at the other thread I linked you to?\n\n \n Yes, yes, yes, I've read your thread. You can choose to respond to me here, or not at all. Your choice. \n \n \nemoticon_frazzled\n Can you admit you just made that standard up?\n\n \n Er ... it doesn't need to be 'made up'--anyone, by any reasonable view would take a WORDING change as sufficing for 'change'. Such a standard of change is already there, by anyone's standard. Meanwhile, you argue your 'change' standard by the arbitrary concept of ...... taa daa .... philosophy! An eye-of-the-beholder concept. How convenient for you. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nPlease. Either give legal precedent for your argument, or admit the answer to the above question is \"Yes\".\n\n \n Legal precedent that a wording change constitutes CHANGE? Gee .... if you need LEGAL precedent for THAT, you're even worse off on this I thought! emoticon_wow\n \n \nI am talking about the EXISTING LEGAL PRECEDENT .... \n\n \n Then cite your \"existing legal precedent\" that really proves your 'philosophy.' 'Cause I don't think you can .... :) I think anything you have to offer here chalks up to \"Foundit's opinion.\"\n \n [QUOTE=foundit66;334314]CLAFCLO.\n I never said anything about \"thinking this would have been taken up if gays had lost the prop 8 amendment\".\n \n Sigh. :xbanghead Here we go again .... I didn't say that 'you said anything' such. This rabbit hole you create every single time you see something you don't want to have to deal with is getting tiresome and old, Foundit.\n \n \nFurthermore, this line of comment you are making is thoroughly useless.\n \n Again, it doesn't address the main issue.\n \n It doesn't make any significant point.\n\n \n Then don't bother continuing this line of discussion, Foundit, if you don't want. NO ONE is making you argue against it. You can cease response on it ANYTIME you want.\n \n \n1) It would be pointless to clog the courts with such procedural challenges on bills that were not going to pass in the first place.\n\n \n LOL. So you'll just choose to 'clog the courts up' with quibbling over 'revision' versus 'amendment' instead. I see!\n \n \n2) This IS HOW WE DO BUSINESS. If you can show me any legislation whose constitutionality and procedural methodology was challenged BEFORE the vote, I welcome you to do so.\n\n \n Yes, I didn't say it's not a normal practice. That doesn't speak to how it proves your motivations AREN'T just about proper due process, though. (And just to pre-empt your all-too-predictable reaction, don't pull the \"I didn't SAY that\" junk. I didn't SAY you said that, so don't even bother wasting typing time for that diversion.) \n \n \n ...you to just make up junk ...\n \n ..This is just a stupid falsehood...\n \n ...Either you were too lazy ....\n \n ... or too deceitful ...\n\n \n And there you go. I notice that when having to actually be challenged on your points, you pretty much always go for personal attacks. There really is no need for that; just refute things if they need to be refuted. I took the personal stuff apart from the rest just to show clearly how they were there, and point them out for what they are.\n \n \n ....[indent] Democracy is a form of government in which power is held by people under a free electoral system. It is derived from the Greek &#948;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#945; ........ \n\n \n Er ... do you actually think if you paste something enough times it will suddenly cease to no longer refute what I said and suddenly start to pertain when it doesn't? Again, I never said it wasn't a republic. You're completely IGNORING the distinctions I pointed out. \n \n \n Meaningless semantics.\n Does my vote have the same power as a senators?\n\n \n So, NO government that has representatives can be called a 'democracy'? EVER? How does that not logically follow from your reasoning, here?\n \n \n CLAFCLO.\n Quote me where I said \"can never be called a democracy to any degree\".\n\n \n Well look, that's the logical outcome of your reasoning. Pure and simple. When you essentially use the PRESENCE of representatives like senators to argue that it's not a democracy, that's the logical outcome. Because EVERY case of government I can think of in the history of the WORLD has had some form of representatives. Again, you really should tell what makes the distinction for you.\n \n \n I never intimated you were saying we weren't a Republic.\n I was making a point to make sure it was understood.\n\n \n What? WHAT is understood? That we're a republic?? Geez, how many times do I need to say it? I think I've said it like, 4 or 5 times now.\n \n The real point is that you don't think we're a democracy, which is so outside the mainstream thinking (for the reasons I've given) that it's pretty funny. :)\n \n \n One requires all people have equal voting power.\n\n \n And again, WHAT government EVER meets that criteria? NO government could EVER qualify as a democracy by THAT standard.\n \n \nCause you see, once again Jyoshu is trying hard not to admit that I am not talking about JUST MY OPINION, but rather I am citing LEGAL PRECEDENT and EXISTING LAW.\n\n \n What you 'cite' in the other thread ultimately STILL comes back to your opinion in terms of interpretation. That's what it IS. At least admit that.\n \n \nJyoshu on the other hand is making up definitions and pretending that his claim of \"changing\" the constitution is somehow the distinguishing factor.\n\n \n Actually, YOU used the term 'change' with reference to this issue, and I'm just continuing the very terminology YOU used. We can quite easily go back to YOUR use of that term.\n \n And I quote ... \"Moreover, the California constitution itself includes two separate requirements for changing the state constitution. One of them, in cases of a more significant change, requires MORE than just a simple majority.\"\n \n 'Course, you'll obfuscate and predictably claim that's not really what you meant. I've seen you do that switch too many times.",

I used YOUR link to show that.\n How you can argue against me using YOUR OWN WEB-SITE is amazing...\n \n \n \nWell look, that's the logical outcome of your reasoning.\n\n No. It doesn't.\n And anybody with a lick of sense could realize that admitting \"democratic traditions\" demonstrates SOME level of democratic action.\n THAT is what is the \"logical outcome\" of my ACTUAL STATEMENTS.\n \n \n \nWhen you essentially use the PRESENCE of representatives like senators to argue that it's not a democracy, that's the logical outcome.\n\n You ever seen one of those iPod speaker get-ups that are put together to resemble things like a dog or a penguin?\n A person would say \"that's dog-like\", but calling it an actual \"dog\" would be inaccurate.\n Any other really simple stuff I can explain to you?\n \n The thing that kills me about this discussion is that AGAIN IT IS NOT JUST ME SAYING THIS.\n I quoted the CIA World Factbook, and now I'm just explaining why it calls us a \"constitutional republic\" with \"democratic traditions\" instead of calling us a \"democracy\".\n \n I mean, it's laughable when you really think about it.\n No matter how much Jyoshu does his little routine, the CIA World Factbook IS STILL going to say \"constitutional republic\" and NOT \"democracy\".\n He may not be able to comprehend why, but the world moves on despite the fact that he cannot get it nonetheless... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nThe real point is that you don't think we're a democracy...\n\n And to that, I give the above reply...\n We're not.\n YOUR OWN DEFINITION explains WHY we are not.\n \n But you continue to ignore the experts, disregard YOUR OWN WEB-SITE, and think you know better, 'mkay?\n \n \n \nWhat you 'cite' in the other thread ultimately STILL comes back to your opinion in terms of interpretation. That's what it IS. At least admit that.\n\n BLOWI.\n Answer the above question regarding legal precedent.\n \n \n \nActually, YOU used the term 'change' with reference to this issue, and I'm just continuing the very terminology YOU used. We can quite easily go back to YOUR use of that term.\n\n I used the term \"change\", which you then proceeded to define for yourself in spite of the actual legal precedent and existing legislation... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n It's like me using the word \"greenhouse effect\", and then you running around trying to dispute my arguments on global warming by talking about ACTUAL GREENHOUSES, ignoring the \"effect\" that is the point...\n \n \n \nAnd I quote ... \"Moreover, the California constitution itself includes two separate requirements for changing the state constitution. One of them, in cases of a more significant change, requires MORE than just a simple majority.\"\n\n Yeah.\n And then you turned around and tried to REDEFINE the word \"change\".\n Or do you REALLY want to revisit your argument where you tried to use the word \"change\" against me???\n \n Come on.\n TRY and restate your argument as regarding \"change\" and the constitution.\n I dare you... emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \n'Course, you'll obfuscate and predictably claim that's not really what you meant. I've seen you do that switch too many times.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n What YOU SAID IN YOUR argument is obviously NOT what I meant.\n \n I still STAND BY my quote above.\n I also stand by a realization that you haven't the cogent sense to comprehend it...",

   "You really need to study up on scriptural terminology and methodology smiley. You'll find that I always refer to God, large G now look back at my reference to Lucifer as the god of this world, small g; he is not a creator god as the maker of all that is, is. He is a fallen angel with powers over the elements and this world, and his mission is to destroy humanity. Here is the doctrine of satan. It will inform you of his character and mission as the most powerful enemy of God in this Age. Here's an excerpt of the link: \n Satan's influence in worldly affairs is also clearly revealed (John 12:31). His various titles reflect his control of the world system: \"the ruler of this world\" (John 12:31), \"the god of this age\" (2 Cor 4:4), and \"the prince of the power of the air\" (Eph 2:2). The Bible declares, \"The whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one\" (1 John 5:19).\n \n Satan exercises his evil power through demons (Matt 12:24; 25:41; Rev 12:7,9). An outburst of demonic activity occurred when Jesus came to earth the first time because of the Savior's attack against Satan's kingdom (Matt 12:28-29; Acts 10:38). Another such outburst is expected just before the second coming of Christ, because this will bring about the downfall of Satan and his angels (Rev 9:3-17; 12:12; 18:2).\n \n Satan also has high intelligence. Through it he deceived Adam and Eve and took over their rule of the world for himself (Gen 1:26; 3:1-7; 2 Cor 11:3). His cleverness enables him to carry out his deceptive work almost at will.\n \n Yet Satan's attributes, impressive as they are, are not limitless. His power is subject to God's restrictions (Job 1:12; Luke 4:6; 2 Thess 2:7-8). The reins of God on his activities are illustrated by Satan's request to God for permission to afflict Job (Job 1:7-12).\n \n Satan is permitted to afflict God's people (Luke 13:16; 1 Thess 2:18; Heb 2:14). But he is never permitted to win an ultimate victory over them (John 14:30-31; 16:33).\n \n A part of Satan's continuing ambition to replace God is his passionate yearning to have others worship him (Matt 4:8-9; Rev 13:4,12). Since God has frustrated this desire and put down Satan's rebellion, he has become God's exact opposite. He is \"the wicked one\" (Matt 13:19,38), while God is \"the Holy One\" (Isa 1:4).\n \n Satan's nature is malicious. His efforts in opposing God, His people, and His truth are tireless (Job 1:7; 2:2; Matt 13:28). He is always opposed to man's best interests (1 Chron 21:1; Zech 3:1-2). Through his role in introducing sin into the human family (Gen 3), Satan has gained the power of death-a power which Christ has broken through His crucifixion and resurrection (Heb 2:14-15)Doctrine of Satan\n\n Strange, didn't see anything resembling proof there. I could quote other books that are just as valid as yours which would show that other Gods exist too.\n \n \n2 Corinthians 4:4 The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.\n \n\n Aah, Corinthians. Your apology is accepted.\n \n \nWOW, are you telling me that you need evidence that true and unrepentant evil exists in this world? I have said before to no avail that humanity is in a spiritual battle against the forces of darkness. For those who don't believe this, they will be the DOAs in the aftermath of this war, having never even put up a fight since they never even believed that the enemy exists. Here is how the bible puts it.\n Eph 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high [places].\n\n Your 'observation' that unrepentant evil exists is no more proof of Lucifer than it is proof of The Wicked Witch of the West and her Flying Monkeys. You claim that there are forces of darkness, yet you are arrogant enough to believe that only your forces of darkness exist and everyone else's are make-believe. Perhaps it is you who does not believe in the true force of evil and will thus not see it coming. Perhaps it is you who belongs to the true Lord of Darkness simply because you do not realise he exists. Another tie.\n \n \nIf you expect me to show you a photo of satan, you're out of luck. It takes some personal discernment and insight to recognize the evidence of his handiwork. Something the unregenerate don't usually have which explains why you're blind to the realities which I so clearly see. \n\n So, as I expected, no evidence.\n \n \nIt's incredible I know, but although we live on the same planet, we literally live in different worlds. I see this world through spiritual eyes which allows me to see the darkness, lies and evil within it, and that it is all a result of the spiritual battle which is never ending since demons don't sleep or take vacations. But all you see are the actions of men with no explanation that goes deeper than they did what they did for whatever reasons which motivated them to do it. \n\n I'll give you one thing, you certainly know a lot about lies (you spout enough).\n \n \nSo I don't know what evidence you expect, because I thought the existence and presence of evil was obvious to everyone.\n\n The existance of evil does nothing to evidence your interpretation of said evil.\n \n Strike 3. Your out. End of the ninth and every one was a swing-and-a-miss.\n \n Smiley",

   "I am talking about California legal definitions.\n I have given the reasons WHY those distinct legal definitions exist.\n That is not \"semantics\". The importance and function have been explained.\n\n \n No, Sigma was right in that thread. He clearly quoted the code that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. All the other stuff you put out there was either your interpretation or someone else's from a blog--not actual pertinent legal material from CA law.\n \n Where is this big explanation of yours that apparently you think makes it a case-closed matter? All I see if you giving your opinion--your TAKE on things. No legal evidence. Though Sigma DID give legal evidence, just to the view you're not willing to go with. (Because it's not advantageous enough to gay marriage, no doubt!)\n \n \nCLAFCLO. Nope, nowhere near your own standards given for this silly little term of yours.\n\n \n It's an analogy. The 18th took away what would a right as well, that has no more backing constitutionally than gay marriage. It took an amendment, and then another amendment to overturn it. It wasn't able to be invalidated on a technicality. (Imagine that!)\n \n Please, do what everyone else here other than you is typically willing to do, and actually consider the implications when someone draws a comparison. Don't just be knee-jerk. If you don't agree with the comparison, then tell us why you don't and point out the problems. Stop using these silly terms of yours as crutch to avoid debate. It's rather transparent, actually.\n \n \nI would love for you to explain that misrepresentation of my argument, but I think we both know you are just interested in tossing out lame junk\n\n \n No, I think what we both know is that you've basically decided to stop debating on anything that doesn't follow you very narrow vision of what any discussion should go down, and any deviation whatsoever you throw out a acronym to avoid that. It's fascinating that you have not participated in a SINGLE thread with someone who's seriously disagreeing with you in a long time where you do not spend considerable amounts of it focused on the POSTER rather than refuting the POST. It really shouldn't be the case that multiple people are having to ask you to be civil.\n \n \nElaborate on what you claim my \"view\" supposedly is on this...\n I grow bored of trying to explain this to you and you refusing to listen...\n\n \n Except, you haven't really been trying to explain it.\n \n I know what your view is, and I see no point in pasting from your opinion post in the other thread.\n \n Despite all that, it's fascinating that I've seen no one actually use REVISING as a standard for what constitutes a 'revision.' You use other standards, but not the one that would be the most common understanding of what a revision would entail. Prop 8 opponents are avoiding the obvious--the very FIRST understanding anyone could come to--that to revise something means actually CHANGING it, as in CHANGING what's written in the constitution. \n \n Your entire argument rests on the idea that the courts have guaranteed gay marriage as a fundamental right, so somehow that makes this a 'revision' rather than an 'amendment.' But that's exactly why I used the example of the 18th amendment. Constitutionally, there's no more basis for gay marriage being a right than having the right to drink a beer. They both boil down to a right granted because they aren't expressly forbid. (If you think the courts mean more to it than that, show how they guarantee the right on more basis than that!) People could have easily called the 18th amendment a \"revision\" instead, but they didn't because it would be pretty silly to do that--just changing the terminology when it's really an amendment, pure and simple. By saying something was a fundamental right to begin with, ANY amendment could be described as a \"revision\" by THAT standard. What amendment could ever suffice as really being an 'amendment'? Is there actually any amendment that could be made to a CONSTITUTION that DOESN'T deal with a 'fundamental right'? \n \n Why don't you just admit what most of the rest of the country knows--that the whole \"revision\" rather than \"amendment\" thing is a semantic tactic--a strategy to use semantics to make things go the way you want them to?\n \n And frankly, I think part of the real problem here is that you just don't understand this issue. Read up on it more; it will help you avoid the tendency of grasping at straws so much. \n \n \nJust a few lines ago, you tried to deride the differentiation between \"revision\" and \"amendment\" as \"semantics\".\n It's statements like that which repeatedly demonstrate you are woefully ignorant on this issue.\n\n \n That's all it is. You know, SAYING over and over your standards are legitimate and legal doesn't do anything at all to prove they are. Take that to court and try your strategy sometime, and see how far it gets ya! emoticon_xagree I think the reason you aren't actually backing anything up here with anything legal is because you can't, quite frankly. \n \n \nAgain, you never went to that link I keep supplying you with...\n\n \n Lie. Yes I did; it's just your opinion, a link to someone's blog which gives the same sort of opinion and you giving begging-the-question type claims like 'this being found a fundamental right by the courts' or something like that, with nothing to back that up. The blog references some legal information, but it relies on interpretation of that information to make its point.\n \n \nIn other words, Jyoshu refuses to admit he DID just make it up.\n\n \n That's like saying that it's 'making something up' to call a 'correction' a case of changing something to something else on a term paper. Stop being beligerent here, Foundit. You know good and well a revision can entail actually REVISING something from a wording standpoint. You HAVE to know that. Surely. \n \n \nI give my opinion, which I back up with LEGAL PRECEDENT and EXISTING LEGISLATION.\n\n \n Um, no you didn't.\n \n All you really basically pointed out the CA court said was that it could be considered a revision if it's \"substantial changes.\" Do you have ANY idea how vague that is? You'd get laughed right out of a courtroom if you tried to pass off that one post you made in the other thread and the blog link as enough proof for what you're arguing. It was YOUR personal interpretation.\n \n \nAlready been done in the thread you CLAIM to have read...\n\n \n BLOWI. \n \n Hasn't been done. You seem to think your linked blog article locks everything thing up for good, don't you? Talk about putting all your eggs in one bottomless basket ...\n \n \nAgain, ignoring the point and attempting to move the goal-posts.\n 1) Jyoshu doesn't even try to argue against the fact that arguing the constitutionality of potential legislation BEFORE it is even passed will \"clog up the courts\".\n\n \n Well, you're the one who made such a big deal of harping earlier on \"this is the way the system works\" or something like that. Guess what... this is too. If you don't want the courts \"clogged up\", don't clog them up yourself to begin with.\n \n \nThe one would \"clog up the courts\" with MEANINGLESS cases. \n\n \n Begs the question. The prop 8 'revision' versus 'amendment' is a meaningless case already, depending on how one views it. Everyone always thinks their case isn't meaningless, and any case they are opposed to IS meaningless. \n \n \nIf the legislation doesn't pass, the court wasted DAYS, possibly WEEKS trying to debate the issue.\n\n \n Yeah, tough. (shrug) That's the way the courts work. You were invoking that concept earlier; now you don't want it to work the way it normally does.\n \n \nThe argument I am posing HAS MEANING, which I have ALREADY PRESENTED.\n\n \n BLOWI. You didn't prove anything as to your case being a \"meaningful\" one.\n \n Once again, you descends into semantic distinction-type arguments that aren't the same person-to-person. Add the term \"meaningless\" to the notches on your semantics-diversion belt.\n \n \nEven if I were to hypothetically prove \"our motivations have absolutely nothing to do with 'due process'\", it WOULD NOT MEAN A THING.\n\n \n No, it wouldn't legally. But it would in terms of PR. I think the quibbling over terms like \"revision\" and \"amendment\" will have a PR negative-effect to to a lot of the rest of the country. It really does come off as looking like desperate grasping at straws 'I'll-do-anything-to-get-what-I-want tactic, and I don't think you quite realize that. There's a whole other side to this, you know. It's not just a LEGAL fight you're picking and waging.\n \n \nWhy should I have to prove or quantify any \"motives\" to you at all?\n\n \n You don't. You are free to go right on looking to exploit any loopholes and workarounds you possibly can to avoid the vote, with no explanation at all. Though it would certainly be WISE for your movement to do so. But that's up to you.\n \n \nIt's more accurate to observe that when you \"challenge my points\", but then you REFUSE to address the answers, that's when I NOTE your tactics and then you lay in with the false passive-aggressive claims of \"personal attacks\".\n\n \n BLOWI. It's more accurate to call them what they are: personal attacks. Still no interest in ever self-reflection?\n \n \n....with that stupid \"change\" junk.... \n\n \n <Foundit getting hostile again<\n \n \nRiddle me this Jyoshu. And I'll go slow for you...\n Do you dispute the fact that the link I have repeatedly supplied provides LEGAL PRECEDENT for explaining the differences between \"revision\" and \"amendment\"?\n I'm ear-marking this as a question you need to answer.\n Failing to do so will demonstrate a LOT about what you're really doing here... emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n <Thump, thump, thump ... Foundit beats chest<\n \n Foundit, I never said you didn't TRY to supply 'legal precedent' for what you're saying. It just falls woefully short, because it's all begging the question type stuff that's someone's opinion. You're trying to use an INTERPRETATION to prove your point rather than the LAW itself. And of course the reason you can't point to law SPECIFICALLY saying gay marriage is a fundamental right and have to point to interpretations on how THIS is a case of revision is because interpretation is all you've got, quite frankly.\n \n \nRepresentatives which have a vote MORE POWERFUL than the actual citizens?\n That would not fit the definition of \"democracy\". I used YOUR link to show that.\n\n \n NOTHING would EVER fit your apparent definition of democracy, Foundit. That's what you don't get.\n \n \nThe thing that kills me about this discussion is that AGAIN IT IS NOT JUST ME SAYING THIS.\n I quoted the CIA World Factbook, and now I'm just explaining why it calls us a \"constitutional republic\" with \"democratic traditions\" instead of calling us a \"democracy\".\n\n \n And there's Foundit, engaging in a bit of deceptive dialog.\n \n You see, there are two different use of the terms 'democracy' here. ONE is a general sense; the Wikipedia article pointed this out. It's why almost every nation in the world self-identifies as a democracy. In that sense we ARE a democracy.\n \n The other use is a more 'official' use of the term. \n \n In a general sense, we certainly ARE a democracy. No one is saying the CIA factbook is wrong, because we aren't saying we're a \"democracy\" with a capital D here. People use that term ALL THE TIME an a general indentifier, and you know that. So stop quibbling.\n \n At any rate, if we just go on the phrase \"democratic tendencies\" instead of saying \"democracy\", it DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. THAT phrase is good enough to point out that we VALUE the votes of the people in this country. So the point is that by you admitting \"democratic tendencies\", my original point is STILL made: voting on something like this IS a democratic tendency, and we're a country that allows that.\n \n \nNo matter how much Jyoshu does his little routine...\n \n He may not be able to comprehend why ...\n\n \n <Foundit being hostile, as is often the case. Which is why others have asked him to stop as well.<\n \n \n.... you haven't the cogent sense to comprehend it...\n\n \n Yet again, Foundit being hostile, and even ENDS on a personal attack type-of comment.

You would try to make another huge strawman out of it.\n \n \n \nDespite all that, it's fascinating that I've seen no one actually use REVISING as a standard for what constitutes a 'revision.' You use other standards, but not the one that would be the most common understanding of what a revision would entail.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n I swear.\n I would BE EMBARRASSED to try and put forth some of the arguments you pretend are intelligent.\n The LEGAL definitions and standards are the ones that are to be used.\n I understand why YOU want to \"use other standards\", but that would be stupid. You don't try to discuss algebra by deciding that a \"right triangle\" is one that is pious and just. \n And you don't try to discuss legal distinctions between \"revision\" and \"amendment\" by redefining \"revision\" to whatever suits your fancy.\n \n \n \nProp 8 opponents are avoiding the obvious--the very FIRST understanding anyone could come to--that to revise something means actually CHANGING it, as in CHANGING what's written in the constitution.\n\n And thus Jyoshu runs back to his earlier absurdity.\n He is trying to argue against \"revision vs amendment\" by misrepresenting the legal reality.\n \n And this argument here is AGAIN POINTLESS. It's like trying to argue \"maroon is a dark color\", also demonstrating that navy is a dark color. \n Ergo, SO WHAT?\n That doesn't mean maroon and navy are somehow the same thing.\n It doesn't mean that the definitions and meanings of navy or maroon have been somehow marred by intelligent criticism.\n \n Jyoshu. Here's a riddle for you.\n Under the EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW, there is a significant difference between the two. Both in the measure of CA constitutional change and the required procedural action.\n Under your approach, IS THERE ANY real difference?\n Or are you trying to argue against the legal standards by boring them to death? By giving your own personal definitions which see no difference like a color-blind guy, and then insisting that there is no difference just cause you refuse to see it?\n \n \n \nYour entire argument rests on the idea that the courts have guaranteed gay marriage as a fundamental right, so somehow that makes this a 'revision' rather than an 'amendment.' But that's exactly why I used the example of the 18th amendment.\n\n Which, again, IS POINTLESS.\n 1) Was alcohol consumption EVER recognized as a fundamental right?\n If so, please QUOTE the documentation.\n \n 2) Just because the FEDERAL government, under ITS standards, successfully followed its procedures for amending the constitution DOES NOT mean anything about the validity of the California process for Prop 8.\n \n 3) You know, if I were to run with this as fast and loose as you have been trying to, I would simply point out that Amendment 18 required a supermajority, while Prop 8 did not.\n Ergo, your analogy is junk.\n \n \n \nConstitutionally, there's no more basis for gay marriage being a right than having the right to drink a beer.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Jyoshu, you and I could debate that, but again it's a case where you PRETEND to debate the \"greenhouse effect\" by complaining that greenhouses are good for plants.\n In THAT debate, you refuse to recognize the importance of legitimate state interests and their practice in right recognition and denial.\n There IS a constitutional basis, and a California Supreme Court obviously disagrees with your assessment.\n Again, it is NOT JUST ME, but a California Supreme Court saying that the CALIFORNIA constitution recognizes that there is no justification for discriminating against gay marriage.\n \n \n \nThey both boil down to a right granted because they aren't expressly forbid.\n\n BLOWI.\n In fact, if you would bother to educate yourself you would realize there has ALREADY BEEN COURT RULINGS showing that polygamy, also not \"expressly forbidden\", has been recognized as NOT being a right.\n There ARE legitimate state interests against polygamy.\n I have explained them to you in the past, but you ignore them in favor of pointing out what people \"could say\"...\n \n \n \n(If you think the courts mean more to it than that, show how they guarantee the right on more basis than that!)\n\n Already been done Jyoshu.\n I've given a brief summary above.\n And I know it will be wasted on you.\n \n \n \nPeople could have easily called the 18th amendment a \"revision\" instead, but they didn't because it would be pretty silly to do that--just changing the terminology when it's really an amendment, pure and simple.\n\n THIS is yet another reason that leads me to believe that Jyoshu DID NOT READ the other post in that other thread.\n \"People could have easily called the 18th amendment a \"revision\" ...\"\n \n NO. THEY COULD NOT.\n The \"revision vs amendment\" is a CALIFORNIA LAW requirement. There is no similarity to it in FEDERAL law.\n And furthermore, the California law does it because it \"thinks\" that there are times that amending the constitution requires JUST a majority.\n While the federal constitution ALWAYS requires the super-majority.\n Or, to put it another way you'll refuse to address, EVERY FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL \"amendment\" IS ALREADY A REVISION.\n \n \n \nWhat amendment could ever suffice as really being an 'amendment'?\n\n ROFLMAO!\n If you had more common sense and a willingness to actually THINK about what other people are saying, you would realize that IN PRACTICE, the 18th amendment was implemented under \"revision\" standards in the first place.\n \n \n \nIs there actually any amendment that could be made to a CONSTITUTION that DOESN'T deal with a 'fundamental right'? \n\n Again, show me any legal documentation that demonstrates alcohol consumption is a \"fundamental right\".\n When you can't do that, you'll have answered your own question as YES!\n \n \n \nWhy don't you just admit what most of the rest of the country knows--that the whole \"revision\" rather than \"amendment\" thing is a semantic tactic--a strategy to use semantics to make things go the way you want them to?\n\n It's existing CA law.\n I have patiently explained the REASONS FOR the CA law.\n You refuse to address them.\n You refuse to address the REAL arguments involved, and have now run down the path of this thoroughly obliterated \"18th amendment\" attempt at an analogy.\n \n \n \nThat's all it is. You know, SAYING over and over your standards are legitimate and legal doesn't do anything at all to prove they are.\n\n I am not using my opinion to claim the standards are \"legitimate and legal\".\n The standards exist IN CALIFORNIA LAW.\n I have cited legal precedent, which you have ignored.\n And then you pretend it's JUST me \"saying\" junk... emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nThat's like saying that it's 'making something up' to call a 'correction' a case of changing something to something else on a term paper.\n\n You can do that for most cases.\n But if we are discussing a LEGAL issue here, and the LAW EXPLICITLY DEFINES a meaning for \"correction\", then it's just plain stupid to try to argue against that by making up your own definition for \"correction\".\n If we WERE NOT talking about a LEGAL definition, or a specific issue that has explicit definitions for specific terms, you would have a point.\n But we are talking about a LEGAL definition, and as such you making up your own definition is pointless.\n \n \n \nI give my opinion, which I back up with LEGAL PRECEDENT and EXISTING LEGISLATION.\n\n \nUm, no you didn't.\n\n BLOWI.\n Further proven just a plain dumb BLOWI by Jyoshu's later claim of \"Foundit, I never said you didn't TRY to supply 'legal precedent' for what you're saying.\"\n \n And the really stupid part of all this is that Jyoshu NEVER EXPLAINS WHY the provided legal documentation doesn't support what I am saying.\n He just gives this idiotically stupid argument of *it's your (and another person's) interpretation of legal documents*.\n \n Well, DUH Jyoshu.\n That's what we do here.\n We read stuff, interpret them, and TALK ABOUT our interpretations.\n I could just as easily respond to EVERYTHING you say by whining \"it's your interpretation\", but that would be stupid and pointless.\n \n \n \nAll you really basically pointed out the CA court said was that it could be considered a revision if it's \"substantial changes.\" Do you have ANY idea how vague that is? You'd get laughed right out of a courtroom if you tried to pass off that one post you made in the other thread and the blog link as enough proof for what you're arguing. It was YOUR personal interpretation.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n OMG. At times, Jyoshu's hubris is just funny if you don't try to take him seriously.\n \n So everybody, stop and think about what Jyoshu is doing.\n Is saying that a \"CA COURT SAID\" something, that if I tried using in a California court, I would be supposedly laughed out of the courtroom.\n \n I've got actual tears in my eyes...\n Jyoshu. YOU may think it's stupid, but it's EXISTING LEGAL DOCUMENTATION which the CA courts DO USE in such cases.\n And no. It's not going to get laughed out of a court. If it was, they would have been able to return that verdict a lot faster than the early next year which is the current projection....\n \n \n \nBLOWI. \n Hasn't been done.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n So your PERSONAL OPINION that something hasn't been done is all it supposedly takes, EVEN WHILE YOU REPEATEDLY REFUSE to even try to touch that article.\n EVEN WHILE you repeatedly demonstrate fundamental misunderstandings of what the article CLEARLY explains...\n \n \n \nYou seem to think your linked blog article locks everything thing up for good, don't you? Talk about putting all your eggs in one bottomless basket ...\n\n Jyoshu, you REALLY don't get what's going on here, do you...\n I present that blog cause I think it provides a pretty good explanation. I give it as a means to convince others of the legal problem with the \"Prop 8\" situation.\n \n And then, others who disagree CAN RESPOND BACK AND EXPLAIN WHY it's supposedly not a good explanation.\n But you? YOU run around and whine about \"you seem to think your article locks everything up\"...\n Yet you REPEATEDLY REFUSE to actually address what the article says.\n You REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATE BLOWI in failing to acknowledge what the article actually says.\n \n EVERYBODY (except for maybe you) posts stuff that they think demonstrates the validity of their cause.\n And then other people CAN DISCUSS it.\n Except you HAVE NOT really tried to discuss it at all. Instead, you just ramble around complaining that there are no actual greenhouses involved...\n \n \n \nWell, you're the one who made such a big deal of harping earlier on \"this is the way the system works\" or something like that. Guess what... this is too. If you don't want the courts \"clogged up\", don't clog them up yourself to begin with.\n\n Lame. REALLY Lame.\n There were two alternatives I presented. One had an obviously superior impact on lessening \"clogging\" of the judicial system.\n You present a third, which essentially requests others to ignore their right to challenge existing law and authority. An actual CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT that we have, you want us to ignore in favor of \"not clogging\".\n \n In my two alternatives, there is no real down-side. If we challenge AFTER something succeeds in demonstrating it has the support to become law, we still get to challenge it.\n But in yours, you want people to forgo a constitutional right instead.\n \n Some of the junk you throw out there is just COMPLETELY lame...\n \n \n \nBegs the question. The prop 8 'revision' versus 'amendment' is a meaningless case already, depending on how one views it. Everyone always thinks their case isn't meaningless, and any case they are opposed to IS meaningless. \n\n And this is another Jyoshu MEANINGLESS response.\n In my scenario, you have ballot measures that are debated in court which ARE NEVER made into law because they lack voter support.\n Do you argue that is NOT meaningless?\n Of course you don't. You can't.\n You don't want to admit that it is meaningless, because then that would show agreement. And BOTH of us saying \"it is meaningless to waste court time on ballot measures that lack voter support to actually make it to become law\" would demonstrate I AM RIGHT.\n \n So, you proceed to your obfuscation.\n YOU CLAIM \"prop 8 revision vs amendment\" is a \"meaningless case\". That's your opinion.\n But that is for a COURT TO DECIDE.\n \n In my scenario, the court ALWAYS GETS TO DECIDE the constitutional challenges.\n In your scenario, you give your opinion and the court doesn't have to decide anything. Which is made even more amusing by your repeated demonstration that you STILL DO NOT know what is really going on with \"revision vs amendment\".\n \n \n \nYeah, tough. (shrug) That's the way the courts work. You were invoking that concept earlier; now you don't want it to work the way it normally does.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n OMG. AGAIN. Tears in my eyes.\n Twice in the same post. Truly classic!\n \n Jyoshu? Sweety?\n Have a seat please, cause this news may be tough for you to take.\n NO. That is NOT the way the courts work.\n The courts DO NOT decide the constitutionality of ballot measures BEFORE the voters vote on them.\n That is done AFTERWARDS.\n \n I can give you plenty of examples to prove my point. Hekc. I can start rattling off ANY Supreme Court case (challenging legislation validity) and we can easily see that...\n YUP! The Supreme court was talking about a law that existed AFTER it had been voted on.\n Lawrence v Texas. Loving v Virginia. Jim Crow law constitutional decisions. etc, etc, etc...\n \n Now. To prove YOUR claim that the courts work the way you pretend in your contradiction of me, can you show ANY court case to support your claim?\n (Yeah. Kinda tough for you to take, huh. That's why I wanted you to sit down first...)\n \n \n \nThe argument I am posing HAS MEANING, which I have ALREADY PRESENTED.\n\n \nBLOWI. You didn't prove anything as to your case being a \"meaningful\" one.\n\n There is nothing \"lying\" or \"willful ignorance\" about my statement.\n The argument HAS MEANING. You disagree. That does not equate to \"BLOWI\", especially when you cannot muster a cogent or knowledgeable response to why it doesn't have meaning.\n And I HAVE already presented it. In the other thread. Which you claim to have read. So obviously THAT can't be \"BLOWI\"... emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nNo, it wouldn't legally.\n\n And thus, you just proved your argument meaningless.\n Thank you! Come again.\n \n \n \nBut it would in terms of PR.\n\n And the court legal interpretation and decision is completely unaffected.\n And in the \"PR\" respect, again I REALLY don't think you get it.\n There are people out there who are ALREADY AGAINST gay marriage.\n Like you, NO MATTER WHAT WE DO, they're going to criticize us. So \"PR\" is meaningless to them, cause LIKE YOU they are already trying to fixate on the \"PR\" aspect of how to make gays look bad instead of actually address the issue.\n \n What this really boils down to is YOUR SPECULATION on how our motivation divides up. How much is based on \"constitutional adherence\", and how much is made up of \"pro-gay marriage desire\"...\n Of course, the fact that they OVERLAP doesn't seem to penetrate your awareness...\n \n I typically avoid talking about the \"motivations\" of the anti-gay folks. It's meaningless. It doesn't make the arguments illegitimate.\n And here, the \"motivations\" are also meaningless. It doesn't refute the validity of the \"amendment vs revision\" legal reality.\n \n \n \nI think the quibbling over terms like \"revision\" and \"amendment\" will have a PR negative-effect to to a lot of the rest of the country. It really does come off as looking like desperate grasping at straws 'I'll-do-anything-to-get-what-I-want tactic, and I don't think you quite realize that. There's a whole other side to this, you know. It's not just a LEGAL fight you're picking and waging.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Okay. This is more of an ABSTRACT one, so bear with me folks.\n \n See. Jyoshu is this guy who routinely REFUSES to assume any responsibility in criticizing his fellow Christian brethren. Even when people point out AND DOCUMENT how others perceive Christianity based on the anti-gay Christian actions, he refuses to realize that he should correct his Christian brethren.\n EVEN IN CASES WHERE HE ADMITS that they are wrong, or he disagrees with them.\n He obviously does not care how the Christians are perceived.\n \n But then, this SAME GUY turns around and pretends to show concern regarding how GAYS will be perceived based on this legal interpretation.\n Jyoshu, the guy who endlessly criticizes gays at a break-neck posting speed, is emoticon_cry over the fact that gays could be perceived negatively in a \"PR\" light...\n (Of course, when it comes to criticizing multi-million dollar organizations that focus all their time and money on PAINTING gays negatively with lies and slurs, since they are Christian he can't be bothered with correcting them...)\n \n So the \"ROFLMAO\" is based on the realization that THIS guy, Jyoshu, is concerned with how OUR actions could make gays look bad and seeks to correct us on that.\n But when it's CHRISTIAN lies and slurs that make gays look bad, he refuses to correct them...\n emoticon_ic\n \n \n \nNOTHING would EVER fit your apparent definition of democracy, Foundit. That's what you don't get.\n\n Jyoshu, a wise man once said \"Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner. Liberty is two wolves attempting to have a sheep for dinner and finding a well-informed, well-armed sheep.\"\n There is a REASON WHY countries are not pure democracies.\n THAT WAS PART OF THE POINT of my ORIGINAL observation that we are a \"republic\" and not a \"democracy\".\n \n \n \nBLOWI. It's more accurate to call them what they are: personal attacks.\n\n Nope!\n I would welcome you to explain how I could make the SAME OBSERVATION OF YOUR TACTICS, yet not have it be a \"personal attack\", but we both know you cannot and will not do that.\n Me pointing out your TACTIC is not a \"personal\" attack, unless you IDENTIFY YOURSELF with the tactic in question.\n \n Is that it Jyoshu?\n Do you self-identify with strawman arguments and obfuscation?\n \n \n \nFoundit, I never said you didn't TRY to supply 'legal precedent' for what you're saying. It just falls woefully short, because it's all begging the question type stuff that's someone's opinion.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n OMG, OMG, OMG...\n So, I evidently DID supply \"legal precedent\", but it's just \"someone's opinion\"...\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n Loving v Virginia? That's just \"someone's opinion\".\n Laws establishing legal definition and application of words? That's just \"someone's opinion\".\n \n Okay. NEXT POST of Jyoshu's I'm going to use this tactic against him and see how long it flies.\n Every single argument he gives, I'm going to just say \"that's someone's opinion\" (or some derivative thereof) and see if Jyoshu can figure a way out of the mime trap he has established for himself...\n \n \n \nYou're trying to use an INTERPRETATION to prove your point rather than the LAW itself. And of course the reason you can't point to law SPECIFICALLY saying gay marriage is a fundamental right and have to point to interpretations on how THIS is a case of revision is because interpretation is all you've got, quite frankly.\n\n Hopefully you're still sitting down, cause this one could be a doozy for you as well.\n Court decisions? LIKE THE ONE I QUOTED?\n They are ALL INTERPRETATIONS.\n I know. Scary stuff huh...\n \n When you've got NINE judges in SCOTUS, and they don't all come back every time saying \"we, the borg, think identically and thus all have the same legal interpretation, which we will provide in this document we label as the OPINION of the court\".\n Sometimes, they < gasp < DISAGREE because they have DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS.\n And the conspiracy theory part of all this is our FOUNDING FATHERS KNEW, and that is why they put MULTIPLE judges on the Supreme Courts.\n (I know it sounds like \"Illuminati\" type stuff, but I swear it's true!)\n \n So you see Jyoshu, YES. I DID quote a COURT \"interpretation\" that agreed with me, substantiating my position and showing the validity of my argument.\n < end sarcasm <\n \n \n \nAnd there's Foundit, engaging in a bit of deceptive dialog.\n You see, there are two different use of the terms 'democracy' here. ONE is a general sense; the Wikipedia article pointed this out. It's why almost every nation in the world self-identifies as a democracy. In that sense we ARE a democracy.\n\n \"In that sense\"....\n emoticon_xdonno\n Just because a country \"claims\" they are a democracy doesn't make them so.\n \n A person can make up all sorts of claims. They can come on to message boards and pretend to be one persona, and then create an alternative persona and go on to the same message board. Neither being true or accurate, and such a situation would be obviously recognized as false and the person utilizing such a deception as sneaky and not to be trusted.\n That doesn't make the person's \"claims\" true...\n \n People run around claiming \"USA #1\" all the time, yet we can go through a LONG list of statistics and demonstrate VERY GOOD score-cards like \"infant mortality\" or \"citizen health care\" and find that we are not #1.\n We can go through a list of OTHER statistics, and examine ways we are close to #1 (if not being #1) like country debt.\n \n But in doing that we are doing WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT and examining EXISTING standards to determine categorization. And in this case, the EXISTING standard is the DICTIONARY.\n I even used your own \"wikipedia\" article to prove my point that we are NOT a democracy. And you don't even try to refute that.\n \n \n \nIn a general sense, we certainly ARE a democracy. No one is saying the CIA factbook is wrong, because we aren't saying we're a \"democracy\" with a capital D here.\n\n Jyoshu. TRY to take a step back.\n Do you EVEN REMEMBER WHY this whole discussion got started in the first place?\n Do you EVEN REMEMBER WHAT POINT I was trying to prove?\n \n (I know that allowing you free venue to answer that question is setting up for a strawman argument, but I'll risk it anyways...)",

People react positively to honesty Jyoshu.\n Whether your fragile ego will let you admit it to yourself or not, IT IS YOU who controls your actions, and consequently people's reactions to your actions.\n If you feel comfortable with joining the likes of Archie, Steeeeve, and Ethmi in saying \"we complain about foundit66\", then that's your prerogative.\n All anybody has to do is LOOK at the crowd I am talking about, and the examples I could easily point out, and they can see EXACTLY what I'm talking about.\n \n Same goes for the examples I pointed out above regarding you, but of course YOU IGNORE all that to whine I'm being \"insulting\" while ignoring THE ORIGINAL ACTION (of yours) which prompted the response you are falsely claiming is \"insulting\".\n When you rise up above that junk, you get a better reaction Jyoshu.\n And that's entirely on you...\n \n I still don't believe you really READ the article in the other thread.\n Your responses, ALL OVER THE PLACE, demonstrate that you're throwing out a half-assed attempt to muster some semblance of a reply, but you're refusing to accurately the position in front of you (whether it be to an unwillingness to take the time to understand or a willingness to deceptively misrepresent).\n \n There's plenty of substance you can respond to, but as always you reach a point where you just start incessantly whining about \"insults\" when you don't have any real ground to go on.\n You stopped having any real conversation several posts ago. The last few posts have been nothing but inanely vague claims while refusing to address the CONTENT presented.\n \n And this current \"look at all these emoticon_cry insults\" riff you got going on?\n It's just another obfuscation attempt.\n And the proof in all this is how you REPEATEDLY keep coming back when you THINK you got an angle to score on.\n But you keep practicing the same ol' tactics, refusing to present your position (and others) in FULL honesty, so people keep pointing it out.\n 'Nuff said...",

   "NEWSWEEK Poll: Support for Gay Marriage Grows | Newsweek Politics | Newsweek.com\n \n \nWhen voters in California, Florida and Arizona approved measures banning same-sex marriage last month, opponents lamented that the country appeared to be turning increasingly intolerant toward gay and lesbian rights. But the latest NEWSWEEK Poll finds growing public support for gay marriage and civil unions-and strong backing for the granting of certain rights associated with marriage, to same-sex couples. \n \n Americans continue to find civil unions for gays and lesbians more palatable than full-fledged marriage. Fifty-five percent of respondents favored legally sanctioned unions or partnerships, while only 39 percent supported marriage rights. Both figures are notably higher than in 2004, when 40 percent backed the former and 33 percent approved of the latter. When it comes to according legal rights in specific areas to gays, the public is even more supportive. Seventy-four percent back inheritance rights for gay domestic partners (compared to 60 percent in 2004), 73 percent approve of extending health insurance and other employee benefits to them (compared to 60 percent in 2004), 67 percent favor granting them Social Security benefits (compared to 55 percent in 2004) and 86 percent support hospital visitation rights (a question that wasn't asked four years ago). In other areas, too, respondents appeared increasingly tolerant. Fifty-three percent favor gay adoption rights (8 points more than in 2004), and 66 percent believe gays should be able to serve openly in the military (6 points more than in 2004).\n \n Despite the recently approved state measures, public opinion nationally has shifted against a federal ban on same-sex marriage. In 2004, people were evenly divided on the question, with 47 percent favoring a constitutional amendment prohibiting gay marriage and 45 percent opposing one. In the latest poll, however, 52 percent oppose a ban and only 43 percent favor one. When respondents were asked about state measures, the numbers were closer: 45 percent said they'd vote in favor of an amendment outlawing gay marriage in their states, while 49 percent said they'd oppose such a measure.\n \n A number of factors seem to play a role in swaying people one way or the other. For instance, 62 percent of Americans say religious beliefs play an important role in shaping their views on gay marriage. According to the survey, two-thirds of those who see marriage as primarily a legal matter support gay marriage. On the other hand, two-thirds of those who see it as mostly a religious matter (or equal parts religious and legal) oppose gay marriage. Moreover, the poll found significant differences across generational lines. Essentially, the younger you are, the more likely you are to support same-sex marriage. About half of those aged 18 to 34 back marriage rights, compared to roughly four in 10 among those aged 35 to 64 and only about two in 10 among those 65 and older. The survey also detected a gender gap, with women more likely to support gay marriage than men, 44 percent to 34 percent. Differences by race appear less noteworthy: 40 percent of whites approve of gay marriage, compared to 37 percent of non-whites.\n \n One reason that tolerance for gay marriage and civil unions may be on the rise is that a growing number of Americans say they know someone who's gay. While in 1994, a NEWSWEEK Poll found that only 53 percent of those questioned knew a gay or lesbian person, that figure today is 78 percent. Drilling down a bit more, 38 percent of adults work with someone gay, 33 percent have a gay family member and 66 percent have a gay friend or acquaintance.\n",

   "Our Mutual Joy\n Opponents of gay marriage often cite Scripture. But what the Bible teaches about love argues for the other side.\n \n By Lisa Miller | NEWSWEEK\n Published Dec 6, 2008 \n From the magazine issue dated Dec 15, 2008\n \n Let's try for a minute to take the religious conservatives at their word and define marriage as the Bible does. Shall we look to Abraham, the great patriarch, who slept with his servant when he discovered his beloved wife Sarah was infertile? Or to Jacob, who fathered children with four different women (two sisters and their servants)? Abraham, Jacob, David, Solomon and the kings of Judah and Israel-all these fathers and heroes were polygamists. The New Testament model of marriage is hardly better. Jesus himself was single and preached an indifference to earthly attachments-especially family. The apostle Paul (also single) regarded marriage as an act of last resort for those unable to contain their animal lust. \"It is better to marry than to burn with passion,\" says the apostle, in one of the most lukewarm endorsements of a treasured institution ever uttered. Would any contemporary heterosexual married couple-who likely woke up on their wedding day harboring some optimistic and newfangled ideas about gender equality and romantic love-turn to the Bible as a how-to script?\n \n Of course not, yet the religious opponents of gay marriage would have it be so.\n \n The battle over gay marriage has been waged for more than a decade, but within the last six months-since California legalized gay marriage and then, with a ballot initiative in November, amended its Constitution to prohibit it-the debate has grown into a full-scale war, with religious-rhetoric slinging to match. Not since 1860, when the country's pulpits were full of preachers pronouncing on slavery, pro and con, has one of our basic social (and economic) institutions been so subject to biblical scrutiny. But whereas in the Civil War the traditionalists had their James Henley Thornwell-and the advocates for change, their Henry Ward Beecher-this time the sides are unevenly matched. All the religious rhetoric, it seems, has been on the side of the gay-marriage opponents, who use Scripture as the foundation for their objections.\n \n The argument goes something like this statement, which the Rev. Richard A. Hunter, a United Methodist minister, gave to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in June: \"The Bible and Jesus define marriage as between one man and one woman. The church cannot condone or bless same-sex marriages because this stands in opposition to Scripture and our tradition.\"\n \n To which there are two obvious responses: First, while the Bible and Jesus say many important things about love and family, neither explicitly defines marriage as between one man and one woman. And second, as the examples above illustrate, no sensible modern person wants marriage-theirs or anyone else's -to look in its particulars anything like what the Bible describes. \"Marriage\" in America refers to two separate things, a religious institution and a civil one, though it is most often enacted as a messy conflation of the two. As a civil institution, marriage offers practical benefits to both partners: contractual rights having to do with taxes; insurance; the care and custody of children; visitation rights; and inheritance. As a religious institution, marriage offers something else: a commitment of both partners before God to love, honor and cherish each other-in sickness and in health, for richer and poorer-in accordance with God's will. In a religious marriage, two people promise to take care of each other, profoundly, the way they believe God cares for them. Biblical literalists will disagree, but the Bible is a living document, powerful for more than 2,000 years because its truths speak to us even as we change through history. In that light, Scripture gives us no good reason why gays and lesbians should not be (civilly and religiously) married-and a number of excellent reasons why they should.\n \n In the Old Testament, the concept of family is fundamental, but examples of what social conservatives would call \"the traditional family\" are scarcely to be found. Marriage was critical to the passing along of tradition and history, as well as to maintaining the Jews' precious and fragile monotheism. But as the Barnard University Bible scholar Alan Segal puts it, the arrangement was between \"one man and as many women as he could pay for.\" Social conservatives point to Adam and Eve as evidence for their one man, one woman argument-in particular, this verse from Genesis: \"Therefore shall a man leave his mother and father, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.\" But as Segal says, if you believe that the Bible was written by men and not handed down in its leather bindings by God, then that verse was written by people for whom polygamy was the way of the world. (The fact that homosexual couples cannot procreate has also been raised as a biblical objection, for didn't God say, \"Be fruitful and multiply\"? But the Bible authors could never have imagined the brave new world of international adoption and assisted reproductive technology-and besides, heterosexuals who are infertile or past the age of reproducing get married all the time.)\n \n Ozzie and Harriet are nowhere in the New Testament either. The biblical Jesus was-in spite of recent efforts of novelists to paint him otherwise-emphatically unmarried. He preached a radical kind of family, a caring community of believers, whose bond in God superseded all blood ties. Leave your families and follow me, Jesus says in the gospels. There will be no marriage in heaven, he says in Matthew. Jesus never mentions homosexuality, but he roundly condemns divorce (leaving a loophole in some cases for the husbands of unfaithful women).\n \n The apostle Paul echoed the Christian Lord's lack of interest in matters of the flesh. For him, celibacy was the Christian ideal, but family stability was the best alternative. Marry if you must, he told his audiences, but do not get divorced. \"To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): a wife must not separate from her husband.\" It probably goes without saying that the phrase \"gay marriage\" does not appear in the Bible at all.\n \n If the bible doesn't give abundant examples of traditional marriage, then what are the gay-marriage opponents really exercised about? Well, homosexuality, of course-specifically sex between men. Sex between women has never, even in biblical times, raised as much ire. In its entry on \"Homosexual Practices,\" the Anchor Bible Dictionary notes that nowhere in the Bible do its authors refer to sex between women, \"possibly because it did not result in true physical 'union' (by male entry).\" The Bible does condemn gay male sex in a handful of passages. Twice Leviticus refers to sex between men as \"an abomination\" (King James version), but these are throwaway lines in a peculiar text given over to codes for living in the ancient Jewish world, a text that devotes verse after verse to treatments for leprosy, cleanliness rituals for menstruating women and the correct way to sacrifice a goat-or a lamb or a turtle dove. Most of us no longer heed Leviticus on haircuts or blood sacrifices; our modern understanding of the world has surpassed its prescriptions. Why would we regard its condemnation of homosexuality with more seriousness than we regard its advice, which is far lengthier, on the best price to pay for a slave?\n \n Paul was tough on homosexuality, though recently progressive scholars have argued that his condemnation of men who \"were inflamed with lust for one another\" (which he calls \"a perversion\") is really a critique of the worst kind of wickedness: self-delusion, violence, promiscuity and debauchery. In his book \"The Arrogance of Nations,\" the scholar Neil Elliott argues that Paul is referring in this famous passage to the depravity of the Roman emperors, the craven habits of Nero and Caligula, a reference his audience would have grasped instantly. \"Paul is not talking about what we call homosexuality at all,\" Elliott says. \"He's talking about a certain group of people who have done everything in this list. We're not dealing with anything like gay love or gay marriage. We're talking about really, really violent people who meet their end and are judged by God.\" In any case, one might add, Paul argued more strenuously against divorce-and at least half of the Christians in America disregard that teaching.\n \n Religious objections to gay marriage are rooted not in the Bible at all, then, but in custom and tradition (and, to talk turkey for a minute, a personal discomfort with gay sex that transcends theological argument). Common prayers and rituals reflect our common practice: the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer describes the participants in a marriage as \"the man and the woman.\" But common practice changes-and for the better, as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said, \"The arc of history is long, but it bends toward justice.\" The Bible endorses slavery, a practice that Americans now universally consider shameful and barbaric. It recommends the death penalty for adulterers (and in Leviticus, for men who have sex with men, for that matter). It provides conceptual shelter for anti-Semites. A mature view of scriptural authority requires us, as we have in the past, to move beyond literalism. The Bible was written for a world so unlike our own, it's impossible to apply its rules, at face value, to ours.\n \n Marriage, specifically, has evolved so as to be unrecognizable to the wives of Abraham and Jacob. Monogamy became the norm in the Christian world in the sixth century; husbands' frequent enjoyment of mistresses and prostitutes became taboo by the beginning of the 20th. (In the NEWSWEEK POLL, 55 percent of respondents said that married heterosexuals who have sex with someone other than their spouses are more morally objectionable than a gay couple in a committed sexual relationship.) By the mid-19th century, U.S. courts were siding with wives who were the victims of domestic violence, and by the 1970s most states had gotten rid of their \"head and master\" laws, which gave husbands the right to decide where a family would live and whether a wife would be able to take a job. Today's vision of marriage as a union of equal partners, joined in a relationship both romantic and pragmatic, is, by very recent standards, radical, says Stephanie Coontz, author of \"Marriage, a History.\"\n \n Religious wedding ceremonies have already changed to reflect new conceptions of marriage. Remember when we used to say \"man and wife\" instead of \"husband and wife\"? Remember when we stopped using the word \"obey\"? Even Miss Manners, the voice of tradition and reason, approved in 1997 of that change. \"It seems,\" she wrote, \"that dropping 'obey' was a sensible editing of a service that made assumptions about marriage that the society no longer holds.\"\n \n We cannot look to the Bible as a marriage manual, but we can read it for universal truths as we struggle toward a more just future. The Bible offers inspiration and warning on the subjects of love, marriage, family and community. It speaks eloquently of the crucial role of families in a fair society and the risks we incur to ourselves and our children should we cease trying to bind ourselves together in loving pairs. Gay men like to point to the story of passionate King David and his friend Jonathan, with whom he was \"one spirit\" and whom he \"loved as he loved himself.\" Conservatives say this is a story about a platonic friendship, but it is also a story about two men who stand up for each other in turbulent times, through violent war and the disapproval of a powerful parent. David rends his clothes at Jonathan's death and, in grieving, writes a song:\n \n I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother;\n You were very dear to me.\n Your love for me was wonderful,\n More wonderful than that of women. Here, the Bible praises enduring love between men. What Jonathan and David did or did not do in privacy is perhaps best left to history and our own imaginations.\n \n In addition to its praise of friendship and its condemnation of divorce, the Bible gives many examples of marriages that defy convention yet benefit the greater community. The Torah discouraged the ancient Hebrews from marrying outside the tribe, yet Moses himself is married to a foreigner, Zipporah. Queen Esther is married to a non-Jew and, according to legend, saves the Jewish people. Rabbi Arthur Waskow, of the Shalom Center in Philadelphia, believes that Judaism thrives through diversity and inclusion. \"I don't think Judaism should or ought to want to leave any portion of the human population outside the religious process,\" he says. \"We should not want to leave [homosexuals] outside the sacred tent.\" The marriage of Joseph and Mary is also unorthodox (to say the least), a case of an unconventional arrangement accepted by society for the common good. The boy needed two human parents, after all.\n \n In the Christian story, the message of acceptance for all is codified. Jesus reaches out to everyone, especially those on the margins, and brings the whole Christian community into his embrace. The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author, cites the story of Jesus revealing himself to the woman at the well- no matter that she had five former husbands and a current boyfriend-as evidence of Christ's all-encompassing love. The great Bible scholar Walter Brueggemann, emeritus professor at Columbia Theological Seminary, quotes the apostle Paul when he looks for biblical support of gay marriage: \"There is neither Greek nor Jew, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Jesus Christ.\" The religious argument for gay marriage, he adds, \"is not generally made with reference to particular texts, but with the general conviction that the Bible is bent toward inclusiveness.\"\n \n The practice of inclusion, even in defiance of social convention, the reaching out to outcasts, the emphasis on togetherness and community over and against chaos, depravity, indifference-all these biblical values argue for gay marriage. If one is for racial equality and the common nature of humanity, then the values of stability, monogamy and family necessarily follow. Terry Davis is the pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Hartford, Conn., and has been presiding over \"holy unions\" since 1992. \"I'm against promiscuity-love ought to be expressed in committed relationships, not through casual sex, and I think the church should recognize the validity of committed same-sex relationships,\" he says.\n \n Still, very few Jewish or Christian denominations do officially endorse gay marriage, even in the states where it is legal. The practice varies by region, by church or synagogue, even by cleric. More progressive denominations-the United Church of Christ, for example-have agreed to support gay marriage. Other denominations and dioceses will do \"holy union\" or \"blessing\" ceremonies, but shy away from the word \"marriage\" because it is politically explosive. So the frustrating, semantic question remains: should gay people be married in the same, sacramental sense that straight people are? I would argue that they should. If we are all God's children, made in his likeness and image, then to deny access to any sacrament based on sexuality is exactly the same thing as denying it based on skin color-and no serious (or even semiserious) person would argue that. People get married \"for their mutual joy,\" explains the Rev. Chloe Breyer, executive director of the Interfaith Center in New York, quoting the Episcopal marriage ceremony. That's what religious people do: care for each other in spite of difficulty, she adds. In marriage, couples grow closer to God: \"Being with one another in community is how you love God. That's what marriage is about.\"\n \n More basic than theology, though, is human need. We want, as Abraham did, to grow old surrounded by friends and family and to be buried at last peacefully among them. We want, as Jesus taught, to love one another for our own good-and, not to be too grandiose about it, for the good of the world. We want our children to grow up in stable homes. What happens in the bedroom, really, has nothing to do with any of this. My friend the priest James Martin says his favorite Scripture relating to the question of homosexuality is Psalm 139, a song that praises the beauty and imperfection in all of us and that glorifies God's knowledge of our most secret selves: \"I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\" And then he adds that in his heart he believes that if Jesus were alive today, he would reach out especially to the gays and lesbians among us, for \"Jesus does not want people to be lonely and sad.\" Let the priest's prayer be our own.\nGay Marriage: Our Mutual Joy | Newsweek Culture | Newsweek.com",

   "1.) You know, someone once pointed out that a good goal to aim for in forums like these is to try and never say things to people or act toward them in a way that you wouldn't do in a real life face-to-face discussion with someone. While everyone naturally acts worse every now and then in an anonymous and non-face-to-face venue like this, most people are able to keep it 'on the calm and civil', most of the time. If they didn't and employed the examples we see above regularly, it would be a sure ticket to losing some teeth now and then. People just don't take kindly to people intentionally being insulting to their face, and naturally so. Once again, Foundit demonstrates why his hostility has been pointed out now by multiple posters. \n \n 2.) Regarding the \"tears in my eyes\" comments (which is the lastest antic in a long string of them), my friend, let's get this much out of the way ... please, get a grip. Seriously. If you have tears in your eyes for any reason--over something in a online discussion forum(!), it really says more about you than it does me or anyone else. I don't mean that as a point of offense, but as point of reality. I seriously doubt there's a single other person here or on most any online forum anywhere that would do that in forums such as these, even if all the rolling-on-the-floor-laughing and \"tears\" thing is for real. (And if it was a lie, then of course that STILL doesn't speak well for you, either.) It's time to chill, dude. \n \n Look, if 'winning' debtes rather than trying to learn and grow in what you know is that important to you that you laugh at people, do the online equivalent of shouting and them, belittling them, constantly trying to 'one-up' them, etc. etc., you are welcome to feel you've won something and claim whatever 'victory' you want. Go for it. It's yours. I think it's safe to say that sort of thing just isn't that important to most people here, myself included. The sad thing is that, between all the personal comments, there was some good discussion here and there. But most of us just aren't interested in weeding through the dung of belligerence and personal hostility to get to an occasional quality point of conversation. It's just not worth it. \n \n Cheers.\n\n \n You know, after being away for quite some time; after reading all of foundits post, I was actually looking forward to your response's.
