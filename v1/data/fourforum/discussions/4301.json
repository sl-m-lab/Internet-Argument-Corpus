Baird notes that on Page 362, the budget outlines the president's plan of borrowing a total of $1 trillion from Social Security during the next five years. \n \n In fact, when the president boasts that he plans to cut the deficit in half by 2009, to $233 billion -- not counting the war, the Alternative Minimum Tax or Social Security transition costs -- one key reason is that in 2009, federal borrowing from Social Security will rise to $252 billion. \n",

Maybe we shouldn't be so intent on scrutinizing candidates for their military records and start requiring them to have a basic understanding of economics and accounting. This budget is an insult to anyone with more than a grade school education, yet it still seems to be heralded by the party loyalists. The only thing I can surmise is the demographic make up of today's Republicans must be primarily those too young to have any stake in the economy, or those too old to care anymore. One thing is certain, the legacy of this administration, and it's spending, will haunt us for many years to come.",

Group, or in this case national emotion is somewhat reliable, on a short-medium term basis, because it happens to be constructed to serve a purpose and those controlling it will make every effort to stabilize and perpetuate the condition. Significant opinion changes by those posters here and on other forums who currently and adamantly support our current administration and those policies shaping our fiscal circumstances will precede cumbersome public opinion polls and news reporting by several weeks or even months. \n \n I've already observed two administration party dogs here begin voicing concern about government spending and waste, meaningless at this stage, but a sign of basic discontent with interlaced government direction as they possibly realize their personal circumstances could be exposed to potential economic failings.",
