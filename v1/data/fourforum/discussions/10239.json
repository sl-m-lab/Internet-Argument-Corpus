So adultery is a sin as well, but where is the public christian outrage? Where are the christian groups lobbying against the rights of adulterers? What groups have called for a constitutional amendment forbidding adulterers to marry? Surely 2 commited, loving individuals in a homosexual relationship who remain faithful to each other are less a threat to the sanctity of marriage than the guy boinking his secretary, or the housewife getting the \"special delivery\" from the mail man.

It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. \n \n Simple, easy to understand passages...even a CHILD could grasp.\n What you've done is add additional meaning to them. Twisting them with a 'thought LEADS to ACTION...' comment that isn't reflected in this plain message.\n What you've done is what the pimps do. Change it to suit your agenda.\n You want to be viewed as compassionate with that love the sinner clap-trap while still preaching biblically supported intolerance of the whole event.\n Tell me where there was love for a unrepentant sinner in the bible?\n No, there are calls to seperate yourself from their immorality least it contaminate you. A fly spoils the ointment you know.\n \n And a repentant sinner who's embraced salvation...isn't a SINNER anymore!\n Praise Jesus!\n\n \n sorry, but there is one part of my body I definitely don't want to lose, for it might come handy in a Hell full of lusty women. So brother take me to hell complete. Hell is my salvation",

You are unable to seperate you fundamentalist beliefs (beliefs that you learn and are in no way genetic, but a choice, yet strangely that choice and freedom, to have, and practice that choice is protected as if it were genetic thing such as race.) from yourself so you take any attack on christianity, no matter how small, as an attack upon yourself. Now put this in to context and look at your own words towards gay people. When you say love the sinner but hate the sin is it that hard for you to understand that you personally attack us with statement like that. We can not seperate ourselves from our sexual orientation it is apart of us and we were born this way. The funny thing is that this whole situation is backwards. Religion, a true choice, is treated as if it is innate. Sexual orientation, something that is innate, is treated as if it is a choice. Funny F'upped the world is sometimes.",
