   "With the passing of Pope John Paul ll, perhaps some reflection on religious beliefs is appropriate. Religion is defined as a set of beliefs concerned with explaining the origins and purposes of the universe, usually involving belief in a supernatural creator and offering guidance in ethics and morals. It also consists of any of several institutions with their own beliefs, rituals, and teachings. Throughout history and even still today, most religions claim to be the one true religion and all others are considered either phony imitations or some sort of heretical sacrilege. It is a sad reality that most people do not recognize the benefit of what can be learned from other religions along the way of their spiritual journey. If one studies the major religions of today such as Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism etcetera they will find more similarities than differences. They are guides for how to live and grow spiritually. Some would argue that religion has been one of the biggest causes of humanity's problems but others counter that it is the misinterpretation of religious tenets that causes strife. Still further, many people see religion as a form of control over the masses whereas others see it as a necessary shield against evil influences.\n \n I had the opportunity to read a book recently concerning near death experiences {NDE}. The book was a compilation of individual testimonies by those who left their bodies temporarily and returned to tell about their experience. The author characterized their stories and then pointed out the large similarities and small differences in each of the NDE's. Two personal friends of mine have had an NDE and shared their experience with me. I've also communicated with a deceased friend by way of a psychic medium. All three sources agreed that upon death of the body, we travel through a tunnel toward a bright, warm and loving light. Upon entering the light, we are given a life review. During the life review, we re-experience all the thoughts, words and actions that came from us. Anything negative is re-experienced as though we are the person on the receiving end of our negativity. For example, one of the contributors to the book re-experienced the event where he had severely beaten another man although this time, he felt the blows he had administered. The whole premise for experiencing the light appears to be an opportunity to examine what we have learned along our spiritual journey. In conclusion, it appears that Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, Confucius, and Buddha were all very wise men who made a significant impact on humanity teaching spirituality as it applied to a specific civilization. Perhaps if humanity could somehow integrate all these religious belief systems toward the goal of one spirituality with God, we could finally begin to see the emergence of world peace.",

   "Just to throw a spanner in the works you're basically saying that we should believe the religious experience of these particular people in deciding what the truth is? I'm playing devils advocate here because what you describe sounds not unlike my best guess of what happens when we die, an opportunity to understand the wrong things we have done and repent of them, before receiving forgiveness from God.\n \n I wouldn't say I view other religions as either of the things you describe. I would say that most are honest attempts to meet God and understand how we are to live our lives, and all suceed in that goal to some extent, only some get closer to the truth than others. As an Anglican I believe that none of us have quite made it to the whole truth but that as Christians we are probably closer than most. Whether I'm right or not remains to be seen. I do believe that most people of faith worship God, but have not come as close as Christianity in knowing Him.",

   "In no way am I trying to disrespect your belief in spirituality, but honestly I think you will probably live to see a world wide unitarian effort to find God which will be lead by the Anti-Christ. Jesus said that no one comses to the Father except through Him. So that right there is the basis for why Christians are so, I guess stuck, on the \"I'm right, you're wrong thing\". Honestly if you have read the Left Behind series you'd have a better understanding as to why it fails in the end. However, I wish people would be more open to things of spiritual nature before judging it so fast.\n \n Love In Christ...",
