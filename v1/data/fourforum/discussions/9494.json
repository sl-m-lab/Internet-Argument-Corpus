   "I also believe the airline acted appropriately. I only wish there were flight attendants everywhere that would remove any family unable to control their child(ren). When kids are running up and down the aisle at the grocery store and the mom or dad is just sitting there looking at canned goods trying to pick out a tasty, affordable stringbean and completely ignoring their child's unacceptable behavior, I get irritated. I understand that sometimes ignoring a child's attention-grabbing antics can be an effective parenting method. However, save that for the privacy of your home. When you are in public, there are other people to consider.\n \n On a side note, I know a girl who was in the grocery store with a similar situation. It was a dad and his son, and the little boy was running up and down the aisle. The dad seemed to be oblivious. His behavior was such that if you told him he even had a son, he might regard you with surprise. When my friend came into the same aisle, it only took a few seconds for her to become annoyed at the father's lack of discipline. Then the kid ran into her. After that, she waited for him to make another pass, then she stuck her leg out and tripped the little booger. Haha! Wouldn't we all love to do that?\n \n The moral here is that parents need to learn to control their kids. Bad kids are usually the result of the parents, just as good kids are usually the result of the parents. This is a lesson that parents need to understand. It could also be applied to our public education system, but that is another thread.",

This child was upset, he was crying and most likely would have calmed right down had his mom been able to hold him and comfort him. For a child to get upset in foriegn surroundings like a cramped plane with strange odors and people isn't a federal crime, nor is it to be unexpected. I believe the Airline offered the family what they did as compensation out of a sense of guilt and responsibility because they knew their employees acted irrationally and irresponsibly because that 3 year old didn't act abnormal at all compared to every other 3 year old alive, either today or 50 years ago. What is wrong with us when we have no patience with children who are acting perfectly normal for their age ? emoticon_confused",

   "Sterilization for social reasons was practiced until not long ago in the USA and maybe it still is.\n \n {Many famous Americans supported eugenics, including John Rockefeller, Alexander Graham Bell, G. Stanley Hall, John H. Kellogg, H.G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, Margaret Sanger and Theodore Roosevelt. Every step that the Germans took was preceded by an action taken by the Americans. The Germans took the ideas of American scientists and carried them out, to the horror of the world. The moral difference between the two countries? eugenicists was negligible. The difference was in the numbers. In the United States, several thousand or scores of thousands of people in some way defective were sterilized. In Germany the numbers were higher. The Germans moved to euthanasia and then to genocide. But, the mentality of both groups of scientists in the United States and Germany was identical: an unshakable belief in the idea that white Caucasians of Nordic stock were superior to all other races, that pure Nordic stock should be increased and races of ?other? stock should be decreased or annihilated. American scientists worked hand in hand with German scientists, loving their work and ?egging? them on. They knew fully well what the Germans began to do to the so-called defective species of human beings. }\n \n This is the link to the above excerpt\n \n http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2006/01/eugenics_a_born.html",
