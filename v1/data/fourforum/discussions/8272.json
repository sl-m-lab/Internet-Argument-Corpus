   "Roids or no roids?? You're not one of those people who actually still says that he might not have used them are you?\n\n \n Nope. I suspect most major leaguers were dabbling in them to some degree. The point is, that even without roids, Barry Bonds would have been, in fact IS, a better ball player than Aaron.\n \n \nExactly. A comparison can't be made because Bonds (and a load of other players) have screwed it all up.\n \n It's an insult and an extreme disservice to those players who aren't cheating.\n\n \n I agree on the disservice to those that aren't cheating. It's not right, but it's reality.\n \n However, both of you need to check into Bond's life time stats. He was well on his way to a hall of fame career and surpassing Aaron before the notion of steroids in baseball even existed. If he decides to keep on playing past his prime like Aaron did, how many HRs will Bonds have potentially hit by the time he and Aaron have the same # of at bats?\n \n Furthermore, if you actually believe that steroids alone can account for the massive margin by which Bonds surpassed Aaron, you don't know much about steroids.\n \n Finally, Aaron and Ruth never faced 7' tall pitchers and fielders that were juiced up on roids either.\n \n I'm no Barry Bonds fan, in fact, I can't stand the guy. However, the numbers don't lie, and being a rational, fact based person, I give respect where respect is due.\n \n A-Rod will be the next one to break the record, so Barry's time as #1 will be short lived anyway.
