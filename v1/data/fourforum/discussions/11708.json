   "So because I am new to this forum I just wanted to defend myself and my right to add posts and threads. Unfortunately I am not getting paid by Obama, but surprisingly, that may just be because I do not work for his campaign, nor will I ever. I have simply posted stories that I find interesting and relevant. It so happens that Obama may seem the benefactor of my posts, but that's more a reflection on McCain's actions than anything else. I hope you do not take my future posts too personally, as they are not meant to offend anyone.",
