Here's one then\n &#8220;If the world has a beginning, and if it has been created, enquire who gave it this beginning, and who was the Creator: or rather, in the fear that human reasonings may make you wander from the truth, Moses has anticipated enquiry by engraving in our hearts, as a seal and a safeguard, the awful name of God: 'In the beginning God created' - It is He, beneficent Nature, Goodness without measure, a worthy object of love for all beings endowed with reason, the beauty the most to be desired, the origin of all that exists, the source of life, intellectual light, impenetrable wisdom, it is He who 'in the beginning created heaven and earth.'&#8220; St. Basil the Great, The Hexaemeron quoted at http://www.orthodox.net/gleanings/creation.html\n And of the writer himself:\n \"St. Basil the Great (329-379).

Be aware that I have three 7th grade science classes and the results must be consistant. I don't exclude any possibilities whether I am uncomfortable about them or not - for example, I am quite uncomfortable with QED and super string theory even though I have read extensively about them. But I don't exclude them. And of course, I'm not in the least uncomfortable about the existence of God. While I do know some scientists who reject the concept of God on philosophical grounds, most scientists that I know and have known don't.

I discussed the history of creationism and \"creation science.\" You seem confused. I'm not sure how the invention of flood geology is somehow a philosophy of science. Creationism is religion whose proponents try to give scientific legitimacy by trying to express it in scientific terms.\n \n If you want to learn about the philosophy of science, the I recommend:\n \n Curd, Martin & Cover, J.A. (eds.). Philosophy of Science: The Central Issues. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1998.\n \n But be warned that it is about 1300 pages long. I suspect that given the difficulty you have demonstrated in understanding a couple of my short posts it may be a bit lengthly for you.\n \nAs discussed earlier, you seem to be moving between 'creationism'; a belief in a creation, to 'creation science'; an attempt to found the belief of a creation in science. Which is it? If it's 'creationism' then you're quite wrong to suggest it started in the late 1800s. I can cite several Orthodox creationists from well before then.\n\n Then you are confused. Just because someone believes in the creation doesn't make him a creationist. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Pope both believe in creation but they are not creationists. I think that it is the result of your ignorance of creationism and \"creation science\" that is at the root of the problem. \"Creation science\" is the philosophical and political efforts to force the mythology of creationism on others by law by making it appear scientific.\n \nThis is why you are anti-religious in your post. Not everyone who believes in creation, is a creation scientist. I believe in creation, and I'm not a creation scientist, so when you attack us all through confusion, you are, well... attacking us all. Such is your zeal to do so, based as it is, on a philosophy of science.\n\n No. Attempting to explain the history and philosophy of a religious movement is not anti-religious. There was no attack. It is not my problem if you are uneducated about the topic. I do notice that you attack science because it conflicts with your religion.

I said that (in the theory stage) people try various tests and sometimes they fail This does not mean the theory is wrong. It just means it's still being developed. This is a very different thing from you saying that it was not based on evidence and testing. It is based on evidence, the tests are still being carried out. The implication was, by you lumping this in with a great core of 'creation science' which you called non-science is that you believe that ID theory is not science.\n \nYou mean like Darwin's 'survival of the fittest' tautology? \n\n \n\"Survival of the fittest\" was Herbert Spencer's invention.

You've not established any trust factor yet :)\n [quote=Montalban] It is if you make one argument, switch to another, then back again, and all the while basing this on a philosophy of science. \n \nI didn't discuss any philosophy of science.\n\n Yes, you did. It's called materialism. You argue against ID theory because it seeks to go outside the materialist bounds and look intelligence, even if that points to God.\n \nI discussed the history of creationism and \"creation science.\" You seem confused. I'm not sure how the invention of flood geology is somehow a philosophy of science. Creationism is religion whose proponents try to give scientific legitimacy by trying to express it in scientific terms.\n\n Sure, I'm not a creation scientist; and materialism is a philosophy of science.\n \n If you want to learn about the philosophy of science, the I recommend:\n Curd, Martin & Cover, J.A. (eds.). Philosophy of Science: The Central Issues. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1998.\n\n If you want to learn about logic, then I suggest that when you discuss a philosophy of science (materialism) then you're discussing a philosophy of science.\n \nBut be warned that it is about 1300 pages long. I suspect that given the difficulty you have demonstrated in understanding a couple of my short posts it may be a bit lengthly (sic) for you.\n\n Ah the cheap shot! Funny you sound awfully like Ungerdunn in saying that. He always posted a statement about how I couldn't understand simple language. In every manifestation that he posted under, he did the same thing. he couldn't help himself. Odd that you do the same.\n \nAs discussed earlier, you seem to be moving between 'creationism'; a belief in a creation, to 'creation science'; an attempt to found the belief of a creation in science. Which is it? If it's 'creationism' then you're quite wrong to suggest it started in the late 1800s. I can cite several Orthodox creationists from well before then. \n\n \nThen you are confused. Just because someone believes in the creation doesn't make him a creationist. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Pope both believe in creation but they are not creationists.\n\n It easy for you to be confused because so many people apply one term to mean the other now days. Quite clearly, the great St. Basil believed in creation. He was a creationist in that it falls within the scope of the meaning. In that he said\n St. Basil the Great in his Hexatemeron says &#8220;Therefore, let it be understood as it has been written.&#8221; \n \n and creationism means...\n \n cre\u00b7a\u00b7tion\u00b7ism P Pronunciation Key (kr-sh-nzm)\n n. \n Belief in the literal interpretation of the account of the creation of the universe and of all living things related in the Bible.\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=creationist (note they give the adjective of the noun; someone who believes in creationism is a creationist)\n Unless you are going to suggest that St. Basil believed in evolution or another theory! Clearly then creationism existed well before the astounding date you give. I can given any number of Christians who pre-date this illogical time-frame of yours, such as Martin Luther, who believed in the literal word of the Bible, in fact he introduced the novel teaching of sola fide; or 'bible-alone', for discerning God's creation.\n \"\"He [Moses] calls 'a spade a spade,' i.e., he employs the terms 'day' and 'evening' without Allegory, just as we customarily do&#8230; we assert that Moses spoke in the literal sense, not allegorically or figuratively, i.e., that the world, with all its creatures, was created within six days, as the words read. If we do not comprehend the reason for this, let us remain pupils and leave the job of teacher to the Holy Spirit.\"\n REFERENCE\n Martin Luther in Jaroslav Peliken, editor, \"Luther's Works,\" Lectures on Genesis Chapters 1-5, Vol. 1 (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1958), pp. 3, 6.\"\n http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-c027.html\n Thus, you mean the Pope is not pro 'creation science.' It's an easy enough mistake to make.\n For your statement to be logical, you're going to have to re-work the majority of Christian beliefs; perhaps all those great Christians had come up with evolution or some other theory :)\n \nI think that it is the result of your ignorance of creationism and \"creation science\" that is at the root of the problem. \"Creation science\" is the philosophical and political efforts to force the mythology of creationism on others by law by making it appear scientific.\n\n Indeed. And creationism is something you said only dates back to the 1800s.\n Post #6\n \nWhat creationists don't understand is that creationism is a modern movement. It arose among 7th Day Adventists in the late 1800s and then got picked up by other fundamentalist Christians in the early 1900s.\n\n What you meant to say is, perhaps 'creation science is a modern movement...\"\n \nThis is why you are anti-religious in your post. Not everyone who believes in creation, is a creation scientist. I believe in creation, and I'm not a creation scientist, so when you attack us all through confusion, you are, well... attacking us all. Such is your zeal to do so, based as it is, on a philosophy of science.\n\n \nNo. Attempting to explain the history and philosophy of a religious movement is not anti-religious. There was no attack. It is not my problem if you are uneducated about the topic.\n\n Ah, irony (shown in retrospect). You support a particular philosophy of science, so you condemn other philosophies of science as non-science.\n \nI do notice that you attack science because it conflicts with your religion.\n\n You recognise this?\n \n I also notice that you seem to lack the fortitude to admit an error. How bizarre to claim that you know the unknowable. Not an example of clear thinking.\n\n You have made the errors here...\n a) assuming something about my knowledge of the tautology Darwin used (again you make the same argument Ungerdunn did)\n and\n b) confusing creationism and creation science; which is understandable; but you should at least admit you were mistaken.",

   "However, you have stated you're uncomfortable with science's attempts to search for God... \n\n \nA lie. I made no such statement. In fact, I clearly stated that I was quite comfortable with the concept of God. Please retract and apologize.\n\n You have berated the efforts of a particular group of scientists efforts to search for God. I never said you are uncomfortable about 'God', because you've stated that you're not. However you have continually stated that you don't think a search by scientists for God is science; because of sciences inherent naturalism, and God being super-natural. That's your claim. The only thing you could quibble about is the degree in the word 'uncomfortable'. Certainly you've made it clear that science should keep clear of the topic.\n \nSure, I'm not a creation scientist; and materialism is a philosophy of science.\n\n \nAnd I'm not a materialist. Why do you find it necessary to misrepresent?\n\n It is a mistake.\n It was a response to your own incorrect statement\n post #15\n \nI didn't discuss any philosophy of science.\n\n And I should have said, yes you have; you defend science for its inherent 'methodological naturalism.' You just assume this philosophy of science is science, and then proceed to state why ID theory is not, because it doesn't share the same philosophical tenets. You stated that science can't test for God...\n (also from post #15)\n \nYou see, science is the logical examination and explanation of what is natural - it is methodological naturalism. By definition, the very concept of God is supernatural and therefore outside the domain of scientific investigation.\n\n So, I admit to my mistake. Let's see you admit to yours.\n I note too you've now dropped two ridiculous claims re:\n a) Darwin's use of a tautology\n and\n b) what is a Creationist.\n Yet you make no apology over that.\n \nIf you want to learn about logic, then I suggest that when you discuss a philosophy of science (materialism) then you're discussing a philosophy of science. \n\n \nBut I'm not discussing materialism. You are pretending that it is somehow relevant to the imposition of your religious philosophy upon science.\n\n As stated above, you are discussing a philosophy of science; methodological naturalism\n \" As far as the methods of science are concerned, popular philosophies of science employ methodological naturalism\"\n http://www.ideacenter.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/1160\n \"Naturalism is, ironically, a controversial philosophy\"\n http://www.freeinquiry.com/naturalism.html\n \nWell, I've had enough of your dishonesty and rudeness.\n\n Who is more dishonest? A person who makes a mistake, and admits to it; or a person who never admits to mistakes, who calls other people rude, questions their intelligence, and continually re-enters a debate under other names, after being banned six times for being rude?\n \nYou asked for references and then are too lazy to actually check them. For you a reference needs to be on the web.\n\n That is a misrepresentation. Withdraw it and apologise at once :) I stated I would prefer a web-based one as it's easier to check.\n \nI suspect that you lack the scientific sophistication to sort out the mush from the facts.
