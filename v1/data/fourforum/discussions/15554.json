One political ad that stands out is current 2012 Presidential candidate and Tea Party member Michele Bachmann and her stance of, \"I will not vote to increase the debt ceiling. It goes completely to commonsense and how I grew up in Iowa. So here I am in Congress watching these people borrow more money that we don't have so that my children can be further indebted. \"\n\n \n I really hate that free speech allows lies that can hurt our country. I don't understand how lack of education can be so accepted.",

   "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can't pay its own bills.\n \n Instead of reducing the deficit, as some people claimed, the fiscal policies of this administration and its allies in Congress will add more than $600 million in debt for each of the next five years.\n \n Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that 'the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better.\n \n I am of course quoting Barack Obama - Senator",
