   "Gays Debate Radical Steps to Curb Unsafe Sex\n By ANDREW JACOBS\n \n After all the thousands of AIDS deaths and all the years of \"Safe Sex Is Hot Sex\" prevention messages, it has come down to this: many gay men who know the rules of engagement in the age of AIDS are not using condoms. As news of a potentially virulent strain of H.I.V. settles in, gay activists and AIDS prevention workers say they are dismayed and angry that the 25-year-old battle against the disease might have to begin all over again.\n \n While many are calling for a renewed commitment to prevention efforts and free condoms, some veterans of the war on AIDS are advocating an entirely new approach to the spread of unsafe sex, much of which is fueled by a surge in methamphetamine abuse. They want to track down those who knowingly engage in risky behavior and try to stop them before they can infect others.\n \n It is a radical idea, born of desperation, that has been gaining ground in recent months as a growing number of gay men become infected despite warnings about unsafe sex.\n \n Although gay advocates and health care workers are just beginning to talk about how this might be done, it could involve showing up at places where impromptu sex parties happen and confronting the participants. Or it might mean infiltrating Web sites that promote gay hookups and thwarting liaisons involving crystal meth.\n \n Other ideas include collaborating with health officials in tracking down the partners of those newly infected with H.I.V. At the very least, these advocates say, gay men must start taking responsibility for their own, before a resurgent epidemic draws government officials who could use even more aggressive tactics.\n \n \"Gay men do not have the right to spread a debilitating and often fatal disease,\" said Charles Kaiser, a historian and author of \"The Gay Metropolis.\" \"A person who is H.I.V.-positive has no more right to unprotected intercourse than he has the right to put a bullet through another person's head,\" he said.\n \n While not endorsing specific strategies, even mainstream organizations like the Gay Men's Health Crisis support the idea of trying methods that would have been anathema a few years ago. \"It makes a community stronger when we take care of ourselves,\" said Ana Oliveira, the organization's executive director, \"and if that means that we have to be much more present and intervene with people who are doing this to themselves and others, then so be it.\"\n \n For many others, however, even talk of such steps provokes hand-wringing. \"We don't want public health vigilantes going out and taking matters into their own hands, particularly if it means breaching the confidentially and civil rights of people with H.I.V.,\" said Jon Givner, the director of the H.I.V. Project at the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. \"Frankly, I find it pretty scary.\"\n \n Whether such ideas gain acceptance, the fact that activists are even thinking about curbing gay sexual freedom is a huge shift.\n \n In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, gay men protested attempts to close down bathhouses and strenuously opposed efforts by health officials to trace those infected with the virus. Until now, those advocates, driven by concerns about privacy and the stigma associated with the disease, have successfully fought off efforts to impose a traditional public-health model for tackling the spread of the virus.\n \n \"You have to remember that was the era when Jesse Helms and others were saying that gay people got what they deserved, and that the government shouldn't spend any money to help them,\" said David Evans, an H.I.V. treatment advocate who writes about prevention. \"There was a time when people thought, 'Oh my god, they're going to put us in camps.' \"\n \n Such fears have faded in recent years, thanks in part to laws that protect people with AIDS against discrimination. Although the number of AIDS-related deaths has plummeted since the advent of a more potent class of drugs in the mid-90's, the rate of new infections has remained unchanged at about 40,000 cases a year, frustrating many advocates.\n \n That frustration has been ratcheted up by the growing popularity of crystal meth in New York, which many say has led to an abrupt increase in unsafe behavior and a spate of infections. Although exact figures are difficult to determine, a recent survey of gay men found that 25 percent had tried crystal meth in the last few months.\n \n Those frustrations were given voice in November by Larry Kramer, the playwright and activist who himself has AIDS, in a widely discussed speech at Cooper Union in which he criticized gay men for their behavior. \"You are still murdering each other,\" he said then. \"Please stop with all the generalizations and avoidance excuses gays have used since the beginning to ditch this responsibility for this fact.\"\n \n In an interview, Mr. Kramer said on Sunday that the warning of a possibly aggressive new strain of H.I.V. confirmed his fears and filled him with a sense of hopelessness. \"Even in the days of the worst infections, no amount of prevention seemed to work, and that's probably the scariest thing of all,\" he said.\n \n Even if the warning turns out to be a false alarm, many AIDS experts say it is only a matter of time before a supervirus does emerge.\n \n \"You can't have a core group of people having sex with large numbers of people without amplifying any sexually transmitted disease that enters the system,\" said Gabriel Rotello, author of \"Sexual Ecology: AIDS and the Destiny of Gay Men.\" \"I don't have any doubt that a resurgent H.I.V. epidemic will hit the gay population in the near future,\" he said.\n \n It is this fear of a drug-resistant virus that has driven some who track the spread of AIDS to suggest a more aggressive approach to prevention. Walter Armstrong, the editor in chief of Poz, a monthly magazine about AIDS and H.I.V., said the traditional fear-based approach to prevention was at best only a temporary solution, especially if no supervirus outbreak materializes. A more effective approach, he said, would involve gay organizations using traditional public health measures, such as more widespread screening and a partner-notification effort to track users of crystal meth who have been infected recently.\n \n \"Why would it not be possible to get them together to communicate to each other, and then to their sex partners, that lives are being put at risk by reckless behavior?\" he asked. \"I think there are ways to do interventions ethically, sensitively and compassionately. There's a huge window of opportunity between criminalization and empty prevention messages.\"\n \n Still, others remain wary of such measures. Walt Odets, a clinical psychologist and the author of \"In the Shadow of the Epidemic: Being HIV-Negative in the Age of AIDS,\" said he thought such intervention smacked of a witch hunt.\n \n He and others said it would be more effective to try to identify the underlying causes of drug abuse and self-destructive behavior, including the difficulty of living in a society that rejects committed gay relationships while condemning homosexuals for having sex outside those relationships. Gay men, he said, are using methamphetamines as an anti-depressant.\n \n Many health experts suggest a more vigorous return to conventional H.I.V. prevention. Isaac Weisfuse, the city's deputy commissioner of health, said his agency was planning to place information banners on gay Web sites and devote more money to hard-hitting ads about methamphetamine use.\n \n And, he noted, the free condom has largely disappeared from public places. \"Unfortunately, condom use has fallen off the radar screen,\" he said. \"We need to do something we did well 20 years ago, which is to get condoms in every place people socialize or have sex.\"\n \n Others, like Mr. Rotello, were less optimistic. Until people really believe an unstoppable virus is out there, he said, they will continue to indulge in unsafe sexual practices. \"People are not going to modify their sexual habits in ways that are difficult or unpleasant until they see their friends dying again,\" he said. \"And to me that's just an unbelievably depressing thought.\"\n \n ================================================== =====\n \n Well now they're finally seeing that they may have a problem suddenly even when the numbers were in their face --- well they have a huge task ahead of them if they suddenly want to calm the monster they've been feeding for the past few decades --- like toning down the parades and the sex shops, bath-houses, and other areas where promescuity is perceived as a norm in group oriented sex. \n \n :phone:",

   "It is my opinion that this article was written by someone who has no idea what he is talking about. He offers quotes of gay activists speaking against unsafe sexual practices then uses his own description to make this seem like an epidemic and to make it appear that gay rights organizations are taking extreme measures when this claim is utterly false. I'm glad this author is able to quote many people speaking on AIDS then take those quotes and make it appear as though AIDS is a bigger part of a gay man's life than it is of anyone else's life. A reader of this article might drop their jaw if I stated that I know over fifty gay people, but I know no one who has AIDS.\n \n \nWell now they're finally seeing that they may have a problem suddenly even when the numbers were in their face --- well they have a huge task ahead of them if they suddenly want to calm the monster they've been feeding for the past few decades --- like toning down the parades and the sex shops, bath-houses, and other areas where promescuity is perceived as a norm in group oriented sex.\n\n \n To claim that gay rights organizations are calming a monster they've been feeding is a metaphor that is biased and untruthful. It assumes that homosexuality or gay rights is somehow a monster, and such a claim is unjustified, especially by such an article which seeks to unfairly portray gays as plagued by an epidemic. Such a claim assumes that homosexuality is the problem, when the real problem lies in irresponsible sex. Supporting equality for homosexuals is in no way, shape or form related to supporting irresponsible sex, although many opponents of gay rights might choose to believe them to be the same.\n \n Furthermore, although I have no problem toning down sex shops and bath houses, I'd imagine there are few people who would disagree with me, and certainly no gay rights organization would. But you cannot slide parades in there, I see that you mentioned them, and I will point it out. Gay rights parades have nothing to do with sexual promiscuity; most are political parades in an attempt to gain equal rights. I do admit that some members of the parades sometimes choose to incorporate freedom of sexuality references, but if you had ever participated in one, you would realize that group-oriented sex is nothing close to the norm and that these events are not problematic.",

Yes, they've been \"feeding a monster.\" The article is encouraging that it indicates some in the gay community may finally be taking it seriously instead of blaming it on everything else they can.\n\n \n I did not and will not claim that AIDS cases are less common in homosexuals than in heterosexuals, and because I have not claimed this, I do not feel the facts speak against me. I have claimed that this is not an epdemic, which it is not. I will also claim that the majority of homosexuals are not at risk for AIDS because the majority of homosexuals are not irresponsibly promiscuous. Certainly there are those who are, but by pointing out homosexuality as the cause, we are pointing out the wrong thing, attacking the wrong problem. There is a correlation between homosexuality and AIDS, but there is no causation.\n \n My criticism of the article is that the author is clearly associating AIDS with homosexuality and suggesting that homosexuals are at a greater risk of getting AIDS than are heterosexuals. Such a claim is absolutely false and unjustifiable. Although AIDS is more common in gay people, a sexually responsible homosexual has no more chance of getting AIDS than a sexually responsible heterosexual, and the majority of homosexuals are sexually responsible. Instead of the author issuing his opinion that \"It is a radical idea, born of desperation, that has been gaining ground in recent months as a growing number of gay men become infected despite warnings about unsafe sex\", he should have written that gay rights groups are attacking the problem at its cause.\n \n \nThe whole culture of homosexuality needs reform, and that's why parades are also part of the problem. In an indirect way, by flaunting a sexual pride lifestyle, it does contribute to HIV problems. In fact, the culture of homosexuality has been a disaster.\n\n \n This is precisely the problem that I am trying to point out. It is not the whole culture of homosexuality which needs a reform, it is a subculture of homosexuality that engages in irresponsible sex. Too many assume the actions or beliefs of this subculture hold true across the entire or much of the homosexual culture, but that couldn't be further from the truth.\n \n I do not doubt that some are in a pride parade to celebrate or flaunt their sexuality, but it is my experience that the majority of those in a pride parade are there speaking out in favor of civil rights for gays. It is why I go, it is why my friends go; we are sold T-Shirts which support gay rights.\n \n \nWell, gay pride parades are less about politics than they are about celebration. They're certainly far less political than they used to be.\n\n \n I disagree; this is certainly untrue of the pride parades in Michigan that I have walked in, at least. It has been my experience that these parades are primarily politically-oriented and the secondary function has been to advertise gay organizations and products to large numbers of homosexuals.\n \n \nAs for sex shops, I'm not sure what \"toning them down\" even means. Smaller signs? No neon? But to the larger issue, I'll disagree with you and so will several gay rights organizations and public health offices. Bath houses and other legal venues, working together with volunteer organizations and public health offices to offer comprehensive information about safe-sex and other health services, result in LOWER rates of STDs in the gay community. It may be counter-intuitive at first glance, but it works.\n \n We should focus on what works.\n\n \n Regarding sex shops, well I was thinking that \"toning them down\" means \"doing away with them\". Your point about bath houses is well-taken. I am probably as prejudiced against them as any other, as I have never been to one. I assume the worst, but perhaps that is not true. Your suggestion that they should be promoting responsible sex seems very reasonable compared to what I have said about bath houses.",

   ". . . and suggesting that homosexuals are at a greater risk of getting AIDS than are heterosexuals. Such a claim is absolutely false and unjustifiable.\n\n \n The numbers don't bear that out--as you can see from the stats.\n \n \nAlthough AIDS is more common in gay people, a sexually responsible homosexual has no more chance of getting AIDS than a sexually responsible heterosexual, and the majority of homosexuals are sexually responsible.\n\n \n But apparently, percentage-wise, there are far less homosexuals being safe in their sex. Also one could argue that the sort of sex practices homosexuals often engage in lends itself more to the possibility of infection. It is an invalid comparison to compare safe-sex practicing gays and safe-sex practicing straight people because gays apparently aren't practicing safe sex as much, on a percentage comparison. So percentage-wise, gay people are getting infected much more than straight people. As of now, homosexuals ARE at a greater risk.\n \n \nInstead of the author issuing his opinion that \"It is a radical idea, born of desperation, that has been gaining ground in recent months as a growing number of gay men become infected despite warnings about unsafe sex\", he should have written that gay rights groups are attacking the problem at its cause.\n\n \n He was reporting the facts. I think your indignation at the article IS an examplr of the very problem and part of the ongoing broader reason gays aren't any farther along with this than they are.

No it's not a gay-only disease, but only because it eventually spread to straight people as well. \n \n Keep you nose straight, don't be promiscuous, and have normal relationships, you will be less likely to get HIV. It's that simple. Are you guaranteed not to get it? No. But the chances shift greatly in your favor to stay HIV-free.\n \n Right now, because of what the stats show, AIDS is still mostly a gay disease in the U.S. That may change someday, but for now that's the way it is.",

   "The numbers don't bear that out--as you can see from the stats.\n\n \n The numbers you presented don't bear that out, but if I showed you numbers comparing AIDS rates in homosexuals who practice safe sex compared to homosexuals who practice unsafe sex, then I too would have numbers supporting my case. Numbers do not speak for themselves; they must be interpreted. The numbers in this case suggest a subculture of homosexuals who engage in irresponsible sex.\n \n \nBut apparently, percentage-wise, there are far less homosexuals being safe in their sex. Also one could argue that the sort of sex practices homosexuals often engage in lends itself more to the possibility of infection. It is an invalid comparison to compare safe-sex practicing gays and safe-sex practicing straight people because gays apparently aren't practicing safe sex as much, on a percentage comparison. So percentage-wise, gay people are getting infected much more than straight people. As of now, homosexuals ARE at a greater risk.\n\n \n That is not true; you are making too large a generalization. For example, let us imagine that I can show that blondes commit suicide more than brunettes. Let us further imagine that a subculture of blondes exists which are isolated from from social groups, and that the entirety of the suicide rates exist in those blondes which are isolated from social groups. It then does not make sense to claim that blondes are at a greater risk of suicide because the vast majority of blondes to not experience that risk. It would appear that the real cause is being isolated from social groups; and it follows to reason that anyone who is isolated from a social group is likely to commit sucicide while anyone who is not isolated from a social group is less likely to commit suicide.\n \n The same can be said about homosexuals and AIDS; there exists some homosexuals who are at a greater risk of AIDS, but most homosexuals are certainly not at a greater risk of AIDS because they do not practice unsafe sex. Stating the generalization that \"homosexuals are at a greater risk of AIDS\" is misleading, and it implies that homosexuality causes AIDS, which simply is not true. Though it is certainly true that on a percentage scale, homosexuals report more HIV infections than do heterosexuals; this is not the same as saying that homosexuals are at a greater risk for HIV, only that more homosexuals get HIV. The ability to transmit HIV is greater in a very common form of homosexual sex, but the ability to transmit HIV is zero when sex is used responsibly. This makes it that much more important to move homosexuals out of the subculture which uses sex irresponsibly.\n \n \nHe was reporting the facts. I think your indignation at the article IS an examplr of the very problem and part of the ongoing broader reason gays aren't any farther along with this than they are. Too many of you in the pride movement simply don't want anyone telling you what you know deep down to be the case, and you don't like the idea of having to actually take recommendations from others outside your movement. You don't want it to be a 'gay-only' problem, yet you only want to have a gay-only solution and not accept opinions from the outside. Face it, gay people have a problem and that is the first step toward overcoming it.\n\n \n What I quoted was not a fact; it was most certainly an opinion. The title itself is a very strong opinion; he makes the claim that these efforts are radical, though it seems to me that they are only sensible.\n \n Actually, I feel that it is those opposed to gay rights who tend to be unable to accept the fact that same-sex couples are deserving of equal rights, and because of this, they tend to generalize the actions of a subculture of gays across the entire group. What would be considered \"individuals acting outside of the norm\" in heterosexual society is generalized across the entirety of homosexuals. I feel that those opposed to gay rights will use any excuse, no matter how unrelated, to deny equality.\n \n But I have not denyed any problem; but I have implyed that looking at this as a \"gay problem\" is an unjustified way of looking at the problem because the cause is not homosexuality and most homosexuals do not experience this problem. It makes sense to analyze the problem, discover what the real cause is, and issue a solution. The problem appears to be an excessive amount of irresponsible sex in a subculture of gay men; and if you like, I will state that the problem applies specifically to gay men, but I will not state that it applies to most nor even many gay men. The solution then, does not appear to be discouraging homosexuality; doing so has helped to create the problem we see now. The solution is to discourage irresponsible sex among gay men. One very powerful method of doing this is to legalize same-sex marriage. Doing so allows us to attack this problem and grant equality at the same time (along with many other benefits). But I feel that opponents of same-sex marriage would irrationally use this as an excuse to deny same-sex marriage by generalizing this behavior across people who do not take part in it. They may claim that \"homosexuals are at a greater risk of AIDS\" and \"homosexuals are promiscuous\" or \"gay people have a problem\", but these are unjustifiable generalizations which are unrelated to equality.",

Numbers do not speak for themselves; they must be interpreted. The numbers in this case suggest a subculture of homosexuals who engage in irresponsible sex.\n\n \n So in your determination to see that the image of homosexuality goes untarnished, you've created 2 separate camps: sex practicing people using \"safe\" sex, and sex practicing people who don't. (meanwhile gay people keep dying of AIDS.) That's easy to do on paper. It's not always realistic. And another problem with your view is that it completely leaves out the promotion of the safest technique of all: abstinence. Sex doesn't have to be mandatory.\n \n You want to assume there is a small \"subculture\" which has this problem, but the problem is that the subculture is influenced and affected by the broader homosexual culture. By condoning gay people to be as promiscuous as they want to be (but tacking onto the end of your statement 'oh, but remember to be safe') you feed this problem. By not enough gay people living out marriage (\"give me the rights, though!\") and monogamy, you feed the problem. By making sexual issues a matter of pride, you influence younger gay people and feed the problem. By trying to lay the blame and the feet of everyone and everything else in society except the culture of homosexuality itself, you feed the problem. You want to paint a picture that the problem only lies in this supposed \"subculture,\" but it is obvious that the problem also has to do with the homosexual culture in general. \n \n \n \n \nThat is not true; you are making too large a generalization. For example, let us imagine that I can show that blondes commit suicide more than brunettes. Let us further imagine that a subculture of blondes exists which are isolated from from social groups,\n\n \n There are many problems with your analogy, least of all being that hair color is not behavioral, having sex is.

Although \"You can't tell me not to go have sex with strangers\" is implied by the saying that others can't tell me what to do, the same is implied by the word \"freedom\"; of course we are able to tell others what to do and restrict freedom in cases where harm exists.

I'm too chicken/prudish/uninterested to go into one. In any case, one of realities of life is that people WILL have sex (despite jyoshu's suggestion that OTHER people stop). Only a very repressive society can manage to put an end to \"illicit\" sex.

And another problem with your view is that it completely leaves out the promotion of the safest technique of all: abstinence. Sex doesn't have to be mandatory.\n\n \n Certainly it is not true on paper, but consider the social connections people make and the opinions they hold of others. Ask yourself how many sexually irresponsible people you know; it is my guess that you are friends with people like yourself, people who practice safely. And what of those sexually irresponsible people you do know? Would you have ever had the urge to have sex with that person? If you did, wouldn't you make darn certain that person didn't have an STD? Although there is certainly intermixing of these groups, homosexuals generally feel the same way that you would on these topics; perhaps they are even more concerned about it because of all the safe-sex promotion going on.\n \n I did not claim that gay sex is safer than no sex; I claimed that it is inappropriate to judge homosexuals as a group that has a high risk for AIDS.\n \n \nYou want to assume there is a small \"subculture\" which has this problem, but the problem is that the subculture is influenced and affected by the broader homosexual culture. By condoning gay people to be as promiscuous as they want to be (but tacking onto the end of your statement 'oh, but remember to be safe') you feed this problem.

You want to paint a picture that the problem only lies in this supposed \"subculture,\" but it is obvious that the problem also has to do with the homosexual culture in general.\n\n \n Certainly neither I nor any gay rights organization is suggesting that people should be as promicuous as they want to be. I am arguing precisely the opposite, and so do gay rights organizations, that homosexuals should choose to live in monogamous marriages and that society should allow them to do so. The homosexual cultures is not what you believe it to be, this can be seen even in the members of the forum here, who argue in support of responsible sex. With articles such as the one in this thread being published, it is no wonder you do not understand homosexual culture.\n \n \nThere are many problems with your analogy, least of all being that hair color is not behavioral, having sex is. Also, why do you assume the \"subculture\" regarding people getting AIDS is so \"isolated\" from the rest of the homosexual culture?\n\n \n The fact that hair color is not a behavior is precisely the point; my intention was to relate something that has nothing to do with suicide to suicide using facts in order to show the difference between correlation and causation.\n \n I assume the subculture is isolated based on the reasons I listed above as well as my own experience. The two groups are naturally seperated from having sex with each other through a difference in sexual values. Further, the places where promiscuous homosexuals meet are not visited as frequenty by most sexually responsible homosexuals, and they are not visited with the same attitude.\n \n \nOne can draw the conclusion of risk from the statistics. This is the value of statistics. Since so many more gay people (percentage-wise) do get HIV, it is reasonable to assume they are more at risk. If stats show that people who don't wear seatbelts die more in car accidents, it is reasonable to assume that people who don't wear seatbelts are at greater risk of death. This is pretty basic stuff.\n\n \n One can draw conclusions from any statistics, that is to be certain, but is it easier to draw the wrong conclusions than it is to draw the right ones. In the case of seatbelts, it is correct to interpret not wearing a seatbelt as a cause of car deaths. It is not correct to interpret gay sex as the cause of AIDS.\n \n \nThis is a separate issue from equality and equal rights. We're simply talking about HIV risk and sex in the homosexual community.\n\n \n It is certainly a seperate issue from equality and equal rights, but I fear that a misunderstanding on this issue leads different treatment of the issue of gay rights, and so the two are interrelated. I did not mean to imply that you use this as a reason to deny gay rights, but I did mean to argue against you from using it as a reason, just in case.",

Once this is understood, one must realize that it is impossible to to achieve same-sex marriage without pride because with the degrading view that so many hold of same-sex relationships, it is impossible to motivate a political movement without reinforcing the idea that people should be proud of their sexual orientation, no matter what anyone might say about it.

This leads me to believe that the cause of this increased irresponsibility in sex is the result of a learned behavior resulting from the values of a subculture, not the culture of homosexuals as a whole. If this can be accepted, then the necessary solution is to attack the values of this sexually irresponsible subculture.\n \n Now our society currently has an institution of marriage which protects the rights of married individuals. We encourage the values of marriage and monogamy by granting marriage benefits to opposite-sex couples. But by granting it to opposite-sex couples and not to same-sex couples, we are reinforcing the idea that those values apply only to opposite-sex couples and not to same-sex couples. To some in that subculture, we are teaching the idea that marriage and marital values apply only to opposite-sex couples. And by removing equality, we may be teaching others that the values of a society are not to be trusted. Legalizing same-sex marriage could reassure many homosexuals in this subculture that perhaps society does have a place for them after all, and that place does not involve irresponsible sex.\n \n Now I should admit that I do not have much experience or knowledge about this irresponsible subculture; my statements regarding what they may think are based on a mere few conversations I have had with people I had suspected to be part of this subculture.

   "It is my opinion that this article was written by someone who has no idea what he is talking about. He offers quotes of gay activists speaking against unsafe sexual practices then uses his own description to make this seem like an epidemic and to make it appear that gay rights organizations are taking extreme measures when this claim is utterly false. I'm glad this author is able to quote many people speaking on AIDS then take those quotes and make it appear as though AIDS is a bigger part of a gay man's life than it is of anyone else's life. A reader of this article might drop their jaw if I stated that I know over fifty gay people, but I know no one who has AIDS.\n \n \n \n To claim that gay rights organizations are calming a monster they've been feeding is a metaphor that is biased and untruthful. It assumes that homosexuality or gay rights is somehow a monster, and such a claim is unjustified, especially by such an article which seeks to unfairly portray gays as plagued by an epidemic. Such a claim assumes that homosexuality is the problem, when the real problem lies in irresponsible sex. Supporting equality for homosexuals is in no way, shape or form related to supporting irresponsible sex, although many opponents of gay rights might choose to believe them to be the same.\n \n Furthermore, although I have no problem toning down sex shops and bath houses, I'd imagine there are few people who would disagree with me, and certainly no gay rights organization would. But you cannot slide parades in there, I see that you mentioned them, and I will point it out. Gay rights parades have nothing to do with sexual promiscuity; most are political parades in an attempt to gain equal rights. I do admit that some members of the parades sometimes choose to incorporate freedom of sexuality references, but if you had ever participated in one, you would realize that group-oriented sex is nothing close to the norm and that these events are not problematic.\n\n I'll tell you what's with it.\n \n HIV and Aids scientists and advisers on both sides of the Atlantic urged caution yesterday over suggestions that a new fast-acting strain of the HIV virus resistant to most anti-retroviral drugs had emerged in New York. \n Health officials in New York suggested that a man in his 40s, who reported multiple sex partners and unprotected anal intercourse, often under the influence the amphetamine crystal meth, might be the harbinger of an aggressive form of the disease which can normally take eight to 10 years or more to develop. \n \n Thomas Friedman, the city's health commissioner, said on Friday the strain might be \"difficult or impossible to treat\". \n \n The unnamed man was only diagnosed with HIV in December, after complaining of feeling ill in November. He had reported tested negative in May 2003, but is now said to be displaying full-blown Aids, suggesting the disease took from two to 20 months to progress.\n \n That is a very serious issue,and a completely valid reason,several malicious people who develop aids by this abnormal life style just go around and spread it because of raging hormones,they not for one minute take into account the effect's it has on the rest of the world much less the partner in question.\n \n It is not an issue that only effects one or two people it effects every single individual who catches this disease.",

   "I don't really understand what part of my argument you were responding to. What you posted is just more reason to be encouraging safe sex and monogamy, which is precisely what gay rights organizations do and what same-sex marriage would do. Certainly no person should be allowed to spread such a disease, regardless of sexual orientation, and we must take action against irresponsible promiscuity to prevent this.\n \n I mean, I guess I already said all of that above; what part of that argument are you contesting?",
