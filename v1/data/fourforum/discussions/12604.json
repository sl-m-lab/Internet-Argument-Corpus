   "Once considered the marks of misfits and sailors, tattoos are becoming more publicly accepted and widespread in the college community, Boston University students and faculty said. A 2006 Pew Research Center survey showed that 36 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds have a tattoo; 40 percent of 26- to 40-year-olds reported going under the needle. \n\n \n The Daily Free Press - Tattoos leaving a larger mark on society\n \n Tattoos have become much more popular in the U.S. in recent decades, and from what I'm seeing, particularly among young women. I'm wondering if a major controversy is just around the corner about it.\n \n Not long ago, I noticed a little boy, with a parent in a food store. He had a some kind of mohawk style haircut and pierced ears. He was no more than 5 or 6 years old. Today on the news, there was a story about a young father who had a gang symbol tattooed on his 7 year old son.\n \n With more and more cases of BOTH parents of young children having tattoos, does it not follow that many of them will want to have it done to their small children? Should there be laws against it? Naturally most children aren't going to like it because it hurts. But a lot of things parents insist on for their children aren't popular with the child - braces on teeth, for example. Should the decision about tattoos be the one thing concerning physical health/cosmetics for parents own children be something that parents cannot decide? Where should the line be drawn on just what parents insist on for their children? \n \n Should this be a federal issue or a state issue? Do any of you non-U.S. resident posters have any experience with this?",

   "I think demanding a child to get a tatoo is ridiculous - but I honestly do not know if it can be stopped. \n\n \n I think it should be treated exactly the same as alcohol and tobacco. Off limits for children, yet up to adults to judge for themselves personally. No guarantees it would stop problems with it concerning children, but it could probably keep it under control. \n \n \nI love ink, have one tatoo myself and will be getting another shortly but if my son wants tats - he will have to wait until he is old enough to get them of his own accord.\n\n \n I think most people who have or want them are like you, it's simply a secular thing that they enjoy. But the book of Leviticus 19:28 says this;\n \n \"Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.\"\n \n Different beliefs throughout Christianity completely run the gamut in interpreting this verse, from declaring the writing of a phone number on a hand with a ballpoint pen to be sinful, to the belief that Christians are completely free to get all the tattoos they want. Like most Christians, mine falls somewhere in the middle - mostly indifference, I'd never get one myself, but believe that under the U.S. Constitution any adult that wants one should be able to do it, and I'm not going to judge them for it. \n \n But along with the very small group of Christians who believe it's seriously sinful, it's only natural that we have another very small group - the militant atheist one that uses tattoos as a way of expressing an opposition to Christianity. They both have a right to exist, and as long as things stay as they are now everything's fine IMO. But this is something that has gained popularity practically overnight - a major culture shift. I think there's a very real possibility that it could shift again, in one of two ways that could cause problems. Way number one I've already touched on - parents who believe it's their decision and no one elses if their child has one, be it a 6 year old who doesn't want it, to a 10 year old who does want it. There are enough people already who clamor for things like abortion, birth control pills, or breast enlargements be paid for by health insurance or government. What could keep demands for third payors for tattoos from being far behind? Way number two is probably far more likely - that the popularity of tattoos goes the way of disco music - it dries up overnight. Then suddenly we have millions of people who want them removed, and who expect health insurance or government to pay for all the research and preceedure for doing it, including lots of new stuff that makes it as painless as possible for themselves. \n \n I'm not saying that there's anything that can be done about it now - other than keeping it away from children until they're 18. (or 16, I think the legal age should be 16, but that's another thread)\n \n \nIn California it is a crime to tattoo anyone under 18 years of age.\n\n \n And there's absolutely no chance that could change? \n \n \nNo it does not. You got some funny ideas about people with tattooing. \n\n \n So it's NOT POSSIBLE that it could become an issue in the future? If an airline company bans smoking on airline flights of 2 hours or less, it's NOT POSSIBLE that they could ban smoking on all their airline flights in the future? If taxes are raised on something, it's NOT POSSIBLE that taxes could be further raised on it in the future? \n \n Differing worldviews have different perceptions of the slippery slope. \n \n \nI don't know a single parent with tattooing that would have their minor child tattooed. I know plenty of such parents. \n\n \n Do you belive that I saw a small child in a food store with his ears pierced, or did I just make that up? If it's not happening in your world, it's not happening? \n \n \nHow sad Marc that you think your average fellow citizen can be so easily likened to the father in the story simply for having a tattoo. \n\n \n Almost as sad as seeing millions of average, beautiful young adult women who so readily liken themselves to a small handful of sailors or rebellious biker chicks of only a few decades ago. \n \n \nDid you not read the article you linked in your OP? \n\n \n Yes I did, the last sentence went like this;\n \n \nLawler said the tattoo process itself is painful, making it \"a sort of initiation.\" \n \"It's interesting those who get one will usually get more,\" Lawler said. \"They are addictive. I can't explain it.\" \n\n \n An initiation - what a concept. emoticon_rolleyes A good way for tough guy dad to make a real man out of his boy? They're \"addictive and he can't explain it\" (who can?) After the pain and cost of their getting done, they're nothing but a visual thing. If they're addictive to one person, they could be addictive to others in the family who see them all the time. It's clear that they've become increasingly addictive to our society. Do you think it's not possible for them to suddenly go out of style - and then for the millions who got them to not expect society to help them reverse their mistake? \n \n \nI have done no research on who is getting tattooed but I will guess and say the growth today is amongst liberal, educated and mildly agnostic youth, the same lot who wouldn't slap a child and will raise them on bottled water and organic carrots. They consider tattooing personal expression. This looses all value if you do it to your children. \n\n \n I see it increasing in the blue collar world as well. Agnostic - yes - that could very well be a common bond. (big surprise) But personal expression can be relayed through children, and it can have societal changes. \n \n \nI can only imagining large amounts of people getting their children inked if there is a major shift in cultural values, something that made people associate strongly with others of a defined group or belief. I do not see such a world coming. \n\n \n Do you see the possibility of all tattooing suddenly going out of style, possibly combined with some kind of new economic shift?",

You can always remove jewelry from small diameter piercings and little will show thereafter. Not permanent in the same way as tattooing IMO. Do you object to little girls with pierced ears? Many Latinos pierce their daughter's ears when the girls are about 3 months old. \n \n Did you know that it was Christian sailors that were the first European men to routinely wear an earring? That way if they were lost at sea they could be recognized when their body washed ashore and given a Christian burial. Or so the story goes.",
