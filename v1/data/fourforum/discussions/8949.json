   "During last ten years Islam got the label of terrorists' and militant religion. These are not only regular wars in Near East but activities of some Muslims terrorist's organizations (al Qaeda, Taliban, Hezbollah and other). The community in USA and Europe collided with problem of Islam. All problems arise at the religion ground. That's why for all religious problems solving we need to find something new, some new approaches.\n It's well-known that Buddhism getting along together successfully with other religiously-philosophic systems - Shinto, Confucianism, Taoism and other. With time passing it gave rise to some synthetical dogmas like Tibetan Lamaism. Quite possible that appearance of new synthetical Muslim- Buddhism religion could allow for Muslims to look more civilized and not terrorists and religious obscurants.\n The striking example of it is Indonesia. The fact is that primordial Buddhism was popularized here but then at the territory of modern Indonesia Islam came. And actual unification of the two religions took place; yes, no doubt that Islam is dominating here but some Buddhism dogmas are employed as well. They say locals are peaceful nice people. Isn't due to this religion unification?",
