   "Yeah, I am not sure what the point of this was. It was certainly a good thing that Dick didn't disown his daughter and he showed her unconditional love, but isn't that normal, expected behavior?\n \n Further on he remained his slippery self:\n \n\n When Purdum asks the vice president whether he thinks gay people are born that way, Cheney scrunches up his mouth, fixes him with a look that says \"Nice try,\" then says: \"I'm not going to get into that. Those are deeply personal questions. You can ask.\"\n \n\n \n He will talk about his daughter, that's not personal. He won't comment on the topic in general, that's too personal. \n \n With respect to the \"gay pride movement\" bs, jyoshu and I had a discussion about that. \n \n \n\n An aside: for your edification. I have noticed you often use the term, gay pride movement. Gay \"pride\" is used almost exclusively for the June event of Pride Day and its festivities. It is a small matter, you needn't go find some web site that says different. I am telling you from personal knowledge. It would lend credibility to your further posts.\n \n\n \n \n \n\n What would you prefer me call your movement? I don't think \"gay rights movement\" is an accurate phrase. I think pride is a lot of what is behind the movement, even if I'm the only one using the phrase. I'm not saying that's good or bad, I'm just calling it as I see it. Even still, I do sometimes use \"gay rights movement\" to refer to it as well.\n \n\n \n \n\n Sheesh! Try to be nice to some people!\n I think you should call a movement what it calls itself, not what you think it ought to be called, from your obviously outsider's point of view. The idea of \"pride\" is as opposed to \"shame\", what we have been made to feel about ourselves, not as in \"hubris.\"\n \n\n \n \n\n What DO you call your movement, then? I'm willing to listen.\n \n\n \n \n\n Thanks. \n \n First, I didn't mean to make a big thing out of this. I just thought you would like to know that gay pride usually means the parade stuff. I am not implying there is some orthodox nomenclature here, that's just the way I hear it. Again, pride meaning a recognition of one's dignity, not that gayness is better than anything else.\n \n Second, it depends upon what you mean by a \"movement\". If you are talking about political or legal issues, I guess \"gay rights\" is the most appropriate. \n \n Otherwise, there is no movement, just us gay folk. We are not monolithic. We only share one characteristic, the gender of the person we are attracted to happens to be the same as our own \n\n \n No further response from jyoshu.\n He said he was willing to listen.\n Sounds like he may have heard, but didn't care to listen.",

The thing is, it's not like it's an insulting phrase. \"Gay pride movement\"? What's insulting about that??? Ironically, one of the whole points of pride is to have pride in something. Why would you be ashamed of being referred to as a pride movement? It IS a pride movement! It's also a rights movement.\n\n And here Jyoshu goes again with his \"spin\" in putting forth something which NOBODY HAS ARGUED in the first place.\n Nobody is saying that we are \"ashamed\" by the idea of \"pride\".\n It's just that it is INACCURATE in compared to the bigger picture.\n \n Plus, I've stated before the REASONS for \"pride\" parades and the like...\n I believe you avoided that post as well...\n \n \n \nThe only thing I can tell you is that the way I see the phrase is in a completely neutral way. I am not trying to imply anything by the use of the phrase \"gay pride movement.\" It IS a movement that embodies pride, is it not? That's the bottom line.\n\n Let's cut through the jibber-jabber...\n Do you think what you call the \"gay pride movement\" is a good thing?\n A bad thing?\n Or a neutral thing?\n \n Feel free to expound on your answer to not be limited by those three possible answers, but DO answer the question...\n \n \n \nThe problem with \"gay rights movement\" is that, IMO, it doesn't even mention the pride aspect.\n\n And part of the problem I have with labelling it \"gay pride movement\" is that it doesn't make any mention of the MORE IMPORTANT aspect of \"gay rights\"...\n \n \n \nFor what it looks like to me the pride aspect is the overall issue of your movement, and legal rights are a part of that. That's why you also fight for not just legal changes, but social acceptance as well, is it not?\n\n How do we fight for \"social acceptance\"?\n I see the \"legal changes\" as the primary thrust.\n I wouldn't call the black civil rights movement as \"black pride\" just because there were \"black pride\" and \"black power\" comments.\n \n There was an Olympic moment where the black medal winning athletes raised their hands in a fist above their head as they bowed their heads. (Hopefully I'm describing that moment right...)\n Would you claim that was about \"black pride\"?\n \n \n \nFurthermore, I definitely think there is a movement there. There are organizations, a flag, accepted (by all the people involved) colors, symbols, marches, etc. It's a movement. :)\n\n I don't think you realize the dynamics of prejudice against gay people.\n People who KNOW gay people are less likely to be prejudiced against gays than those who \"don't know\" any gay people.\n And the truth is that those \"don't know\" any gay people PROBABLY DO know a gay person. (We number one in twenty.) They just don't know it.\n \n The fact that being gay isn't as obvious as skin color WORKS AGAINST gay people in terms of other people's support for discrimination.\n \n So part of the point of \"coming out\" and \"pride\" is to help show the world WHO we are. How we live right next door, and we're not as bad as some make us out to be. To help give a face to those being discriminated against...\n \n But I'm sure you, being a non-gay person who only knows an \"ex-gay\" person, know the minds of gay people better than us...\n emoticon_xdonno",

By the definition above, it's a continuum that exists in a range anywhere from gay to straight and bi in-between, and it has to do with feelings and emotion. So why does do some people in the gay rights movement treat the concept of sexual orientation as some sort of matter of pride, or scientifically understood catagorical concept?
