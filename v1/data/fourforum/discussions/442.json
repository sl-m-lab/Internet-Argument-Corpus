   "Education in the United States\n by: Patrick Cowett\n Written: November, 1999\n There is a myth in this country, a widely accepted falsehood. Most Americans are taught from birth that it is important to go to school in order to get a good education. They are taught that a good education is necessary to be successful in this country. Now, that doesn't sound like a bad idea on the surface... But what is \"education\" in America? Why is it so important?\n Way back in history, a revolutionary new idea was thought of! A center of learning should be built in order to teach people a trade. This idea was expanded to give students a more well-rounded education by teaching students in areas other than just their specific area of interest. School was practical and it helped to expand people's horizons. This was a great idea! But what happened to this idea? How has it developed in this country?\n A long time ago, it seemed like all one needed was a high-school diploma to get a decent, respectable job. But there were those few who went to college and earned higher degrees. These people of course had an advantage over those with just high-school diplomas. Over the course of time, other people began to realize that they too could have an advantage by going to college, so more and more people went to college. And now, it's very difficult or often impossible to get a decent job without a college degree (at least this is what people are taught, and so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy). High-school diplomas mean very little in the job market today. Today, there are some who go to graduate school. These people now have an advantage over those who just go to college. It's now almost the norm to go to graduate school. In a couple of decades, that too will be a minimum requirement to get a decent job, and a college degree will have little meaning. Why is this? Is it because there's more knowledge that needs to be learned in order to do what needs to get done at a job? I think many would answer yes. But I submit that the answer is no.\n From talking to many people in the work-force, who have college and/or graduate degrees, most have said they had forgotten most of what they learned in school. Most of the knowledge they needed for the job, they learned on the job, or they taught themselves. I've also heard of many instances of individuals with college, graduate, even PHD degrees, who once they graduated and got to their job, were totally incompitent and knew virtually nothing that they needed to know. Or if they had the knowledge, they didn't have the skill. There are many people who are very compitent and knowledgeable from their life's experiences and being self-taught - who cannot get a decent job, or if they do get a decent job, they're paid an indecent amount, just because they don't have a college degree. So how useful is college? And how useful is graduate school?\n I submit that graduate school, college, and even high-school is largely a waste of time. It has proven that it does not teach knowledge or skills anywhere near adequately to do the job (of course there are exceptions). Yet, an employer still looks at that useless piece of paper called a degree instead of skill or experience. And the foolish employer decides based on what's totally worthless instead of what's really useful.\n People spend 1/4 of their lives to learn a skill (which is not adequately taught to them) in order to work for 1/2 of their lives and retire for the last 1/4 of their lives. There's something very wrong with those numbers! That first fourth of their entire lives is largely wasted!! And many die due to a horrible tragedy before finishing school, so all that school was largely a waste of time for them. What did they get to accomplish with their lives while they were here? A few would say alot, and they'd be right. But many would be greatly disappointed, because they lived for the future, far more than for the present, and that future was taken from them. Another falsehood which is widely accepted is that you have to accomplish a,b,&c first before you can start to live your life. Many people have plans for their future, and their present is completely dedicated to the future. These people are wasting their lives. As the old Latin quote goes, \"Carpe Diem\" - Seize the day!\n It is becoming more and more popular to drop out of school, because students, adults and kids, are tired of wasting their time, when they could be using it much more wisely, doing something worth-while for a change. Yes, there are some benefits to school at present, but when you count the cost - all that time invested with a SMALL return.... it's just not worth it. School teaches people to waste their time and it eats away their hope. That's what beaurocracies and similar \"systems\" do.\n What schools need to start doing is to prepare people for the future and for work. It needs to start teaching people independence, so they can work or start their own business (immigrants are much more likely to succeed in their own business here than people born in America are)- rather than dependence on a corrupt system. School and work need to not be so parasitic that they eat away the life-force of a person to the point where there's hardly anything left to actually live life with. Life is more than food and shelter and other material things. I submit that everything that school is useful for could and should be taught before high-school - if schools would stop nurturing traces of laziness in kids to the point where that laziness becomes overwhelmingly the standard and efficiency goes toward zero, but would actually use the time efficiently.\n More efficiently does not mean increasing to 8-hour days (or more) or increasing home-work. But it does include decreasing the time and eliminating the HOME-work. School-work should be left at school just as job-work should be left at the office. People learn (and remember too!) by doing. A science CLASS and a science LAB should be indistinguishable from one another. History is about ordinary people, and should be taught and experienced as such. It's not about dead or dry facts. Kids shouldn't be taught to think that people in other times were boring. And kids who have special gifts, talents, or skills should have those nurtured, not ignored, or even punished- as is the case often, just as kids with difficulties learning in certain ways should be taught in other ways that are better for them. Conventional school was so incompatible with one kid named Albert Einstein that he failed it. When that boy grew up, he proved himself to be a genius! A few new terms have even been created to describe people who do not fit well in this horrible, parasitic system of education that we have today. One term is called \"learning disabled\", and it is a lie! It and other such terms are propoganda circulated by a corrupt system for non-conformity! School is teaching disabled - now that's more accurate!\n Yesterday, high-school was the minimum. Today college is the minimum. Tomorrow, graduate school will be the minimum, and there will be another level of schooling above graduate school that isn't known today. If this already hyper-inflated educational system keeps inflating like this, people will be going to school for 70 years in order to work for 10 years, and it'll get worse! Of course this is totally ridiculous. And that is why the educational system in this country will crumble before then if this inflation isn't stopped soon. Just look at all the people who are dropping out of school at various levels; look at all the people who are tired of working for unreasonable employers, working unreasonable hours to keep up with the competition (since when did producing have to be a soul-consuming competition?), people who try to start their own businesses because they're not satisfied with \"the system\". The whole thing's already beginning to crumble.",

   "Wow man, you need to get a grip, I think you might have lost a little touch with reality! Look, while our educational system is not perfect, it works. You pose the basic question of why a 3rd grade education is no longer sufficient. Well, 200 years ago, it may have been. Many people did not need the ability to write or read, because many people were farmers. Society was much less comlex in times gone by. Well, we have had something called a technological revolution in this world, maybe you have heard of it. Do you really want someone with a 6th grade reading skill in charge of the emergency procedures at the local nuclear power plant? Or how about a doctor that says \"well, i don't really know much about that disease, I would look it up, but then again, I can't read real well, so I will just give you these 13 different medications. I never took pharmacology as I never got past 4th grade, so I don't really know if they might react against one another. If they don't seem to work together or make you worse, come back, and I will give you more pills.\" How about a pilot...do you want him learning on the job? I am a pilot, so I can speak of this with some bit of authority. Think of it, you have a captain and a first officer in the cockpit. Suppose the first officer is on his first day in your \"on the job training world.\" You just got airborne, and the captain dies. OOPS. SOMEBODY HELP ME, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FLY. passenger: Why not? WELL IT'S MY FIRST DAY AND HE DIED BEFORE HE COULD SHOW ME ANYTHING. As a pilot, I have attended a lot of school. Now honestly, did learning shakespeare in high school help me? No. Did learning physics help me? Yes. Did learning how to communicate with others help me? Yes Did math help me? Yes. Did science class help me understand pressure, pressure gradients, fluid dynamics, newtons laws (the concept of which tells us how an airplane even flies), weather? Yes. Do i need to know these things to fly? Yes, every day. \n \n \nThey are taught that a good education is necessary to be successful in this country.\n \n \n no, it is important to be successful as a human.\n \n \nA long time ago, it seemed like all one needed was a high-school diploma to get a decent, respectable job. But there were those few who went to college and earned higher degrees.\n \n \n True. But as technology has advanced, one must learn more. Doctors in days of old would do nothing if someone had an MI (heart attack). These were trained professionals, yes, but what was their level of education? They would have said, \"well sir, the pain will either stop or you will die, we will see.\" Today, a cardiologist (someone TRAINED to specifically deal with disease and disorders of the heart) will suggest anti-platelet aggregation therapy, arrhythmia suppresion through antiarrhythmics, pressure support /control by use of vasopressors, fluids, and antihypertensive medications, diagnostic testing including 12 lead ECG (which must be interpreted by a TRAINED individual), cardiac enzymes and other blood testing, and probable cardiac catherterization for vascular comprimise assessment. Most likely, if bad enough, you will undergo bypass surgery, which involves and entire team of TRAINED and highly SKILLED doctors, nurses, perfusionists, anesthesiologists, and others removing a section of vein (normally the saphenous vein in the leg) and grafting it in place of the occluded section of coronary artery. Now if you go to the hospital tonight with chest pain, what doctor do you want? Point being, that technology has advanced to the point where doctors now require and enormous amount of education in order to be competent in their field. Ask a doctor some time if they think they would have been able to understand complex pathophysiology without first understanding anatomy and physiology. Each level of education builds on the previous level. You can;t just learn a set of basic skills in elementary school then walk into an operating room and say, \"ok doc, had me the scalpal, show me what to cut, yeah that vesel? Ok, i got it. oops, why is that bleeding...ohh...i didn't know i had to clamp it first...\" \n \n \nFrom talking to many people in the work-force, who have college and/or graduate degrees, most have said they had forgotten most of what they learned in school. Most of the knowledge they needed for the job, they learned on the job, or they taught themselves. \n \n \n What jobs do these people do? It does not say. I went to paramedic school, and worked as a paramedic for several years. I of course was well prepared to work as a paramedic because I went to school to train for it. I have not worked as a medic in about 1 1/2 years, and I have forgotten some things about it. It is true that if you don't use what you are taught you will lose it. So these people (note the lack of specificity or supporting figures by the original author) have forgotten a good bit of what they have learned. Is it possible that it is because they went to school and got a degree in accounting and now work in a factory assembling tonka toys? (please don't take this to be condescending for anyone who works in a factory...)",

One term is called \"learning disabled\", and it is a lie!\n \n \n While this is a little extreme, I think this is the first part of this article to have a tiny bit of merit. Many people do learn differently than others, although I would still say that there are people without the capacity to learn or learn at a normal rate (thus: learning disabled). I think that the term learning disabled is a valid term that applies to some, but in other cases it is applied to lazy people, or those that are just plain dumb.

And the educational system will crumble because of uneducated people...like the author...who offer ridiculous solutions to very real problems. True, our education system is not perfect, but suggesting that our children abandon it to persure life experience is not a valid solution. Education is neccessary in todays society...unless you want to be a \"bum\" (which could be argued that even a \"bum\" needs some sort of education to survive in this world. As for me, if my doctor tells me that instead of attending medical school he watched ER or just read a few books on his own, I will find another doctor. That is the way our society works today. Those with education will move forward, make money, and contribute to society. Those without an education will be left behind. Like I said, less competition for my EDUCATED children.",
