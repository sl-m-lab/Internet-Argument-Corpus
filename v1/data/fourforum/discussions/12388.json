   "Again and again.\n \n Quite a number of unsavoury droppings left behind by the Bushes before they left the White House:\n \n Helicopters:\n \nFebruary 24 2009....\n WASHINGTON (CNN) - President Barack Obama put on hold an order for a fleet of new helicopters that will cost at least $11 billion, his spokesman told CNN Tuesday.\n \n \"The president talked to the secretary of defense, and I think as he said yesterday to Sen. (John) McCain, we don't need any new helicopters at the White House,\" Robert Gibbs said on CNN's \"American Morning.\"\n \n .... The price tag for the proposed new fleet of 28 helicopters has virtually doubled to more than $11 billion over the last six years. Each helicopter in the fleet would reportedly cost around $400 million.\n \n President Bush put in the order for new high-security presidential helicopters in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States....\n\n CNN Political Ticker: All politics, all the time Blog Archive - Gibbs: Obama puts new presidential helicopters on hold - Blogs from CNN.com\n \n In the wake of September 11, 2001? Why did it take so long to deliver the copters? \n \n All I've got to say is, this is mighty interesting timing. Delivery just in time for Obama to get the bill.

If it isn't settled soon, the brewing controversy also has the potential to become the first diplomatic dust-up between President Barack Obama and America's strongest Middle East ally.\n \n At issue is an unpaid $320 bill for dinner with a White House advance team at a restaurant near Olmert's official residence.\n \n For nine months, Restobar co-owner Abigail Elior said, she and her staff have been quietly trying to get the prime minister's office to pay the tab and avoid becoming Israel's highest-profile scofflaws.\n \n .... It all began last May, when an Olmert aide called Restobar to ask whether the restaurant could take a last-minute booking for a meal with a White House advance team that was in town to prepare for then-President George W. Bush's second visit to Israel.\n \n The group dined on entrecote and beer, pasta and sorbet, chocolate mousse and lattes. They finished things off with apple pie.\n \n \"They ate. They drank. They had a nice bill at the end of the evening,\" Elior said....\n\n Bush advance team's unpaid dinner tab an Israeli scandal | McClatchy Washington Bureau\n \n Once again, the Bush people act irresponsibly and stick Obama with the bill.\n \n Next...

   "Laura Bush and the china:\n \nLaura Bush Unveils Her Pricey China Half a million in private funds went to plates\n Before she leaves the White House, the outgoing First Lady has just a few simple tasks: she has to take the incoming First Lady on a little tour, she has to bundle up as many free gifts and silverware and furniture as possible and smuggle them out before anybody finds out what a tacky move that is, and she has to unveil a set of impossibly expensive china she has just purchased and will never be able to use....\n \n The real loser in this equation is Michelle Obama, who will have to use these terribly precious basket-weave plates until she has a chance to slip away to Target and get a perfectly tasteful bunch of plates at $7 a setting.
