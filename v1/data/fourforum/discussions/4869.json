   "I see no pattern in the terms Liberal and Conservative. The terms are being used interchangeable with Republican and Democratic.\n \n If we go down the list of issues that face American politics, each party has points where they stand for individual freedom and each has points where they stand for societal overhaul.\n \n The terms aren't about ideology. As in almost everything, it's really about money. Where to spend it? Everybody agrees we should spend less.\n \n What we really all want is a change in the way government works. We want government to answer to citizens rather than special interest groups. Neither party will ever change that. They're not about to kill their own golden goose.\n \n What we're left with is a system where the government keeps changing hands from one party to the other. While each is in office, they spend lots of money on their own pet projects, while committing us for decades to come. Then comes the other party in to power to do the same thing. And we're left with a financial overlap between the parties where everybody wins -- and loses. Hence, the deficit. As each new administration reviews the budget, they find there is no new money. Previous administrations, on both sides of the aisle have already spent it all. But that doesn't stop the newest one from grabbing their own gusto. The current administration is no exception.\n \n So, we as citizens have done the logical thing. We've decided to ignore the whole situation and work on societal problems. We can't truly commit to solving our problems with energy independence, or unemployment, or the trade deficit, the cost of insurance (all kinds of insurance). We're too busy fighting over abortion.\n \n Anybody else notice that the abortion debate isn't getting put to bed - either way? Do you really think the politicians want it solved? No. It's keeping our attention while they ........\n \n Hey guys. We're all playing right in to the hands of the politicians.",

   "I am aware that many people who call themselves conservative seem feel that one of the parts of being \"conservative\" involves keeping the government out of the lives of individuals, but political science coins the term differently. According to political science, there are sort of four corners of political ideology. These are conservative, libertarian, liberal, and populist.\n \n Conservatives believe in government intervention in the moral and social realms, but not in the economic realm.\n \n Libertarians believe in no government intervention in neither the social and moral realm nor the economic realm.\n \n Liberals believe in no government intervention in social and moral realm, but government intervention in the economic realm.\n \n Populists (aka Authoritarians) believe in government intervention in both the social and moral realm as well as the economic realm.\n \n This fun little quiz can tell you where you stand! http://www.ontheissues.org/quizeng/XPolitics/start.asp (Just click the Don't Save button at the bottom if you want to take the quiz without registering).\n \n I'm not sure how good it is, but I come up as a liberal-libertarian (I'm on the line between liberal and libertarian) which accurately describes me, as I support keeping the government out of social and moral issues, while I am moderate when it comes to government intervention in the economy.\n \n I will not argue that modern Republicans seem to be acting more like populists/authoritarians than usual, sometimes tending toward increasing government intervention in both fiscal issues and social/moral issues.",

   "The problem IMHO, it that the term \"liberal\" has been turned into a derogatory catch all for anyone and anything that disagrees with anyone who is a self proclaimed \"conservative\", ie a Bush administration supporter. (Note the quotation marks, as the actual definitions of liberal and conservative are irrelevent as currently used.)\n \n This has largely been done by the likes of conservative media personalities like Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly in order to form a blanket term with which to attack and label as part of there \"us vs. them, you're either with us or against us\" black and white mentality.\n \n Much like those that must resort to \"colorful\" language in life, many of those same people also rely on a simple term like \"liberal\" when they are attempting to discuss things that they aren't actually capable of discussing or understanding on any kind of an intellectual or mature basis.\n \n \"Liberal\" has become the fu#% of the political vocabulary. It has endless uses and endless meanings, especially when used in combination with other juicy adjectives. :p \n \n Waxy",
