   "This is a broad topic, so i'll begin small.\n \n That Jesus was crucified is attested to multiple (independent) times in the first and early second centuries CE. In his first letter to the Corinthians, written somewhere between 54 and 57 CE, Paul tells us (2.8) that:\n \n \n...none of the princes of this age knew [the wisdom of God]: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\n\n \n The Second Evangelist, in GMark, attests to the same but with considerably more detail (i.e. chapter 15).\n \n The Fourth Evangelist, in GJohn, does the same (i.e. chapter 19).\n \n In his Annals, Tacitus writes (15.44) that:\n \n \nChristus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.\n\n \n In Antiquities 18.3.3 (reconstructed ala Meier 1991), Josephus states:\n \n \nAnd there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, for he was a doer of paradoxical works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure, and many Jews on the one hand and also many of the Greeks on the other he drew to himself. And when, on the accusation of some of the principal men among us, Pilate had condemned him to a cross, those who had first loved him did not cease to do so. And even till now the tribe of Christians, so named from this man, has not gone extinct.\n\n \n Is there anything prima facie implausable about Jesus' death by crucifixion? We know that it was a widely practiced form of execution, in Rome and elsewhere. We also know it was one unlikely to have been invented; crucifixion was a deplorable, ignoble way to meet your end. Josephus (in Wars 7) describes crucifixion as \"a most miserable death,\" Paul (Gal 5.11) calls it an \"offense\" and Seneca, in his 101st epistle, says he \"should deem [Maecenas] most despicable had he wished to live up to the very time of crucifixion.\" Even suicide were preferable to the cross and its \"long drawn-out agony.\"\n \n It was a source of dispersions cast on Christians by critics. The pagan Caecilius in M. Felix's Octavius claims \"the objects of their worship include a man who suffered death as a criminal, as well as the wretched wood of his cross,\" and that these two deserve each other; the wretched man, punished for wicked crime, and the equally wicked Christians who worship him. This sort of depiction was appearently widespread. Even Paul admits (1 Cor 1.23) that the crucifixion of Jesus appears \"a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.\"\n \n We might also add that no one seems to have ever doubted its historicity, at least until modern times.\n \n Now, considering this admittedly short review, the question becomes: if we are to take this crucifixion of Jesus as anything but historical, how and why?\n \n Ychiz?",

   "It is not a particularly unlikely scenario, that a person named Jesus was crucified at some time in Judea. It is not implausible, as crucifiction was a form of execution, although how widespread it was is still subject to debate.\n \n However, two important points arise. \n \n First, all our sources of the era are somewhat unreliable. In an age lacking means of quick communication, the historians themselves rarely wrote of things they witnessed themselves, but rather relied on reports by others, which is essentially hearsay. Read the comparative biographies by Plutarch and you'll see how he notes that differing accounts of the events had to be considered. Acts of people of the same name could get combined (you get accounts of Hyppolitos of Rhodos building a great temple and Hyppolitos of Rhodos hunting a great boar, but lacking accessible census data, how would one know whether this was the same guy, or just a regular stonemason and a regular hunter, neither of which is Hyppolitos of Rhodos who ruled at the time), author bias was considerable, facts got rather embellished in the process and similar. Thus, we cannot be absolutey sure.\n \n Second, more importantly: that someone named Jesus was crucified does not automatically mean that all the things attributed to the man are completely true. Take modern times: while you get reports that \"El Jefe X\", leader of the \"Revolutionary Party of Country Y\" was convicted of treason and executed from all over the place, whether he was a reformer, terrorist, visionary, prophet and similar depends upon who makes the report.\n \n Based upon the available evidence, I believe that Jesus did exist, did try to reform the Jewish religion of the time, did stress the importance of inner conviction over outside ritual. This likely made him unpopular with the Jewish leaders, which managed to get him executed by crucifiction. Essentially, a wise man whose attempt at reform failed at the time, but managed to get significant influence later. No evidence of a divine nature of the man is indicated.\n \n Oh, one other thing: one must be careful not to mix up the historical existence of Jesus issue with bible inerrancy issues. While differing accounts which are consistent in main elements are a good indication for historical existence, as we assume fallible authors remembered things differently and similar, they are not compatible with the idea of an inerrant bible. For that, they cannot be fallible, all accounts must be completely compatible and similar. Here, I think the whole idea fails.",

   " No evidence of a divine nature of the man is indicated.\n\n \n Well, certainly the Scriptures provide numerous passages of the divine nature of Jesus, but that aside I'd like to ask: What would have been evidence of a divine nature in Jesus to those he came in contact with? \n \n \nOh, one other thing: one must be careful not to mix up the historical existence of Jesus issue with bible inerrancy issues. While differing accounts which are consistent in main elements are a good indication for historical existence, as we assume fallible authors remembered things differently and similar, they are not compatible with the idea of an inerrant bible. For that, they cannot be fallible, all accounts must be completely compatible and similar. Here, I think the whole idea fails.\n\n \n That's based on the assumption that all the authors who did speak about his divinity were all in error. There's no evidence that I know of that substantiates that. So, it is premature to state that the \"whole idea fails,\" I think.",

   "No, Easy, it's not as simple. You are both mixing the issues up and failing to recognize the central idea of my post.\n \n First, the Bible as evidence. You must realise that a source cannot refer to itself as a source for itself. This leads to an endless loop, the bible is accurate because it says it is right, and it is right in saying it is right because it is saying it is right.\n \n Think about it this way: if the logical construction were applicable to the bible, you would also have to accept that the Communist Manifesto is also proof that the ultimate form of society is communist \"absence of state\" with communal ownership of the means of production.\n \n Thus, the bible can be considered a source, but its validity is subject to evaluation. Evaluating, we find that the Bible is a bit problematic, as it makes claims that are at odds with the world as observed and is biased as it is a religious text written by the members of the religion. Also, several sources differ between themselves, and the actual content must be extrapolated from these, allowing for interpretation, metaphor and similar.\n \n This process of evaluation thus casts little doubt that a person vaguely filling Jeus' description existed, founded a religious movement and was executed by crucifiction. Contemporary authors do not find this objectionable. However, the evaluation does cast serious doubt on supernatural occurences cited, on the universal applicability and absolute validity of the ethical, moral and legal precepts of the bible and similar.\n \n The same goes for all other sources of the time. Historians were hard pressed for sources at the time, as you had no daily newspapers, foreign correspondents and similar. Thus, the mithical stories of Romulus and Remus as founders of Rome are evaluated and compared with archeological data, metaphorical language and similar. Were you to read Plutarch's paralell biographies, you might be surprised how the historian himself was offered differing accounts and interpretations. For example, he explained how some sources believed Romulus and Remus to have been raised by a she-wolf who lost her cubs, while another source wondered whether the she-wolf was actually referring to a \"woman of ill repute\", which were also referred to as she-wolves. (imagine reading torn piece of paper, saying that Bobby was raised by a bitch (as in, the word meaning a female dog), but you have no other sources to tell whether this just meant a troubled parent-child relationship or an actual baby raised by animals, which does happen and gets some media attention). Looking at it, we may find it possible that someone named Romulus founded the city named Rome, or that he maybe just expanded an existing Etruscan settlement (having found archeological evidence of an older settlement). However, we find his divine heritage questionable, even though it is often mentioned. Or is this unfair liberal left bias against gods?\n \n \n \n Now, we get to the other part. Bible inerrancy is a separate issue. If the bible is the perfect work of a perfect God, as claimed by, well, you, it must be wholly internally consistent. Otherwise, you have to allow interpretation, historical meaning, changing times, progress of knowledge, metaphorical and allegorical to enter the discussion.",

   "God Fearing Ath: In his first letter to the Corinthians, written somewhere between 54 and 57 CE, Paul tells us (2.8) that:\n \n ********************\n ...none of the princes of this age knew [the wisdom of God]: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. \n ********************\n \n\n \n Paul was not a witness of Jesus' (\"alleged\") crucifixion. Paul is simply retelling the stories he had been told.\n \n \n \nGod Fearing Ath: The Second Evangelist, in GMark, attests to the same but with considerably more detail (i.e. chapter 15).\n\n \n \"Mark\" was probably not one of Jesus' actual followers: \"Mark\" probably did not live in Palestine, was educated and could read and write, wrote his gospel in Greek (not in Aramic), and his gospel was not written until some 40 years after Jesus died.\n \n Do you have any valid evidence that \"Mark\" was an actual witness to Jesus' (\"alleged\") crucifixion? Or was he, like Paul, just retelling the stories he had been told? \n \n \nGod Fearing Ath: The Fourth Evangelist, in GJohn, does the same (i.e. chapter 19).\n\n \n The Gospel of \"John\" is considered to have been written between 90 and 95 AD. That's 60 to 65 years after Jesus died. The author was not alive (or was at best still a very young child) back when the \"alleged\" crucifixion occurred: he too did not witness the event firsthand and is just retelling what he been told.\n \n \nGod Fearing Ath: In his Annals, Tacitus writes (15.44) that:\n \n *********************\n Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular. \n *********************\n \n\n \n Again, not an eyewitness. In fact, \"The Annals\" was not written until somewhere around 115 AD, some 85 years after Jesus' (\"alleged\") crucifixion. This is just another person retelling the stories he had heard.\n \n \nGod Feaing Ath: In Antiquities 18.3.3 (reconstructed ala Meier 1991), Josephus states:\n \n *********************\n And there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, for he was a doer of paradoxical works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure, and many Jews on the one hand and also many of the Greeks on the other he drew to himself. And when, on the accusation of some of the principal men among us, Pilate had condemned him to a cross, those who had first loved him did not cease to do so. And even till now the tribe of Christians, so named from this man, has not gone extinct. \n *********************\n \n\n \n Again, not an eyewitness. Again, a person simply retelling stories he had heard.\n \n And we should remember that there are 2 passages about Jesus in Flavius Josephus' works, and that the one that really stands out in regards to saying who Jesus \"really was\" is considered to be either a completely fabricated, later passage added by Christians, or a doctored form of Josephus' original, with the forging being done by Christians to change the original mere mention of Jesus into a claimed historical account of Jesus being the supernatural Christ. So unfortunately, since Christians were the ones who maintained Josephus' works over the years (because Jews considered him a 'traitor' to the Romans), and we have a very good case of them having fiddled around with Josephus' works, these statements about Jesus are highly suspect.\n \n Also, Josephus mentions many other people named Jesus, and devotes about the same number of words to them as to Jesus \"Christ\". Hardly what one would expect if Josephus really believed \"our\" Jesus to be the true Son of God who was sent to Earth to die for the sins of the world.\n \n \n \nGod Fearing Ath: Is there anything prima facie implausable about Jesus' death by crucifixion?\n\n \n There is nothing implausible about someone living in first century Palestine, who is considered to be a criminal of one sort or another, being crucified. But...\n \n 1) This does not show that a man named Jesus of Nazareth was actually crucified.\n \n 2) This does not show that a man named Jesus of Nazareth actually existed. For example, that a man named Bill O'Mally of Bethseda would have been crucified in first century Palestine if he had been convicted of trying to overthrow Roman rule, does not show that a man named Bill O'Mally of Bethseda actually lived in first century Palestine.\n \n 3) This does not show that Jesus was supernatural, or any of the other claims about Him (such as His having died for the sins of the world).\n \n \nGod Fearing Ath: We might also add that no one seems to have ever doubted its historicity, at least until modern times.\n\n \n We might also add that no one seems to have ever doubted the historicity of Adam and Eve, at least until modern times.\n \n Generally speaking, everything in the Bible - talking burning bushes, 6-day creation of the universe, a Noachian deluge, etc. - was taken as absolute historical fact - and unable to be questioned - until the rise of science and the Enlightenment.\n \n \nGod Fearing Ath: Now, considering this admittedly short review, the question becomes: if we are to take this crucifixion of Jesus as anything but historical, how and why?\n\n \n 1) You have not shown that Jesus of Nazareth Himself actually existed. Before you can expect the rational and objective person to accept a historical fact that He was crucified, you first have to present convincing evidence that He existed.\n \n 2) Even if we ignore the problem of your failing to establish that Jesus existed, even if we, for the sake of argument take that as a given ... you have not shown that Jesus was actually crucified. All you have shown is that a few people say that it happened. The historical fact here is that they say it happened, not that it did happen. \n \n In addition, the testimony is not highly reliable because these claimants wrote at least 40 years after the event, and were simply retelling stories they themselves had been told.\n \n 3) Even if you end up succeeding in demonstrating the first two points, you still will not have shown that Jesus died for the sins of the world. That is a theological view and cannot be demonstrated historically.",

He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. 4 On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. \n \n 1 John 4:14 - And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. \n \n 2 Peter 1:16 - We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\n \n Luke 1:1 - Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3 Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. \n \n Matthew 28:5 - The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. 7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.\" 8 So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 Suddenly Jesus met them. \"Greetings,\" he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.\n\n \n \n Except, of course, none of those were written by eye witnesses. I am quite sure that no one saw an angel.\n \n The writer of 1 John was not an eye witness. He was relating a story that was told (or made it up himself). Luke specifically says he is writting down\n what other people have said, so he was not an eye witness, but was relating a story.\n \n And Matthew??? This is the guy who had zombies running around Jerusalum, and had to double the amount of everything. Hardly an eye witness.\n \n So you have given quotes of books written at least 35 or more years after the events that claim there were eyewitnessses. The writers themselves were not eyewitnessess. And, from the style of writing, it appears to me they were relating a story. \n \n So, when you look at it, your claims for eye witnesses is suprious.",

   "EasyRider, for your quotes from Luke, I don't need to add anymore than what Trebor already did ...\n \n \nTrebor: Luke specifically says he is writting down what other people have said, so he was not an eye witness, but was relating a story.\n\n \n And for your quotes from Acts, all I need do is add that the author of Luke was also the author of Acts.\n \n And we all know that Paul does not even claim to be a firsthand eyewitness of Jesus' (\"alleged\") crucifixion. \n \n \n So down go all of your Luke, Acts, and Paul-written quotes ... <flush<\n \n \n \nEasyRider: John 20:26 - A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" 27 Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\" \n 28 Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\" \n\n \n 1) Are you claiming that Thomas was an eyewitness to Jesus' crucifixion? Can you show us proof texts?\n \n 2) This story of doubting Thomas is wonderful. Thomas is one of the Jesus' personal disciples, who walked around with Jesus for some years, witnessing first hand (we are told) the many miracles of Jesus, and then told by Jesus Himself that He must die and then be resurrected three days later. After all of this, Thomas does not believe! He has to stick his finger into Jesus' wounds before he'll believe. Yeah, now THAT makes perfect sense!\n \n Tell you what, EasyRider, you go find Jesus and tell him to come down here to earth again, and tell Him to let me stick my finger into His holes (ooooh, sounds kinky!), and then I'll believe.\n \n \nEasyRider: John 20:16 - Jesus said to her, \"Mary.\" She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, \"Rabboni!\" (which means Teacher). 17 Jesus said, \"Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' \" 18 Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: \"I have seen the Lord!\" And she told them that he had said these things to her. \n\n \n 1) A general note that makes any quotes from John about the crucifixion problematic. \"John\" (whoever the author really was, who wrote his gospel some 60 to 65 years after the fact) has Jesus being crucified on the SAME day that the Passover Feast was PREPARED, yet the canonical gospels have Jesus being crucified on the day AFTER that Passover Feast was EATEN. Both can't be right EZ. \n \n 2) This passage does not mention anything about the crucifixion, and even with the presupposition that Jesus must have been crucified in order to be resurrected, it still doesn't produce any firsthand eyewitnesses: it merely CLAIMS there were firsthand eyewitnesses, someone other the person doing the writing, and with the claim being made some 60+ years after the fact, probably by someone who is just retelling stories he had been told.\n \n \n \nEasyRider: 2 Peter 1:16 - We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\n\n \n Where does this refer to Jesus' (\"alleged\") crucifixion?\n \n And critical scholars generally agree that :\n \n 1) 2 Peter was one of the last books of the New Testament written, making it, if nothing else, a less reliable source than the earlier works.\n \n 2) 2 Peter was not written by Simon Peter, despite it's claim to having been: it's a forgery.\n \n \n \nEasyRider: Matthew 28:5 - The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. 7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.\" 8 So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 Suddenly Jesus met them. \"Greetings,\" he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.\n\n \n This passage also does not mention Jesus' crucifixion. Man, never mind hitting a bullseye, you couldn't even hit the side of a barn!\n \n And this passage too is interesting, in that it contradicts another gospel. In this one, the women are told:\n \n \n\"[Jesus] is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.\" \n\n \n Yet in Luke, the disciples remain in Jerusalem, and that is where they see Jesus.",

   "Paul was not a witness of Jesus' (\"alleged\") crucifixion. Paul is simply retelling the stories he had been told.\n\n \n I did not say Paul was a witness to Jesus' crucifixion, DamEtel.\n \n \n\"Mark\" was probably not one of Jesus' actual followers: \"Mark\" probably did not live in Palestine, was educated and could read and write, wrote his gospel in Greek (not in Aramic), and his gospel was not written until some 40 years after Jesus died.\n\n \n I did not say GMark was written by one of Jesus' immediate followers, DamEtel, nor did I claim it was written in Aramaic or in Palestine.\n \n \nDo you have any valid evidence that \"Mark\" was an actual witness to Jesus' (\"alleged\") crucifixion? Or was he, like Paul, just retelling the stories he had been told?\n\n \n I did not claim, nor have I ever claimed, that GMark was written by an eyewitness of Jesus' crucifixion.\n \n \nThe Gospel of \"John\" is considered to have been written between 90 and 95 AD. That's 60 to 65 years after Jesus died. The author was not alive (or was at best still a very young child) back when the \"alleged\" crucifixion occurred: he too did not witness the event firsthand and is just retelling what he been told.\n\n \n I did not claim GJohn was written by an eyewitness, DamEtal.\n \n \nAgain, not an eyewitness. In fact, \"The Annals\" was not written until somewhere around 115 AD, some 85 years after Jesus' (\"alleged\") crucifixion. This is just another person retelling the stories he had heard.\n\n \n I did not claim Tacitus was an eyewitness to Jesus' crucifixion, DamEtal.\n \n \nAgain, not an eyewitness. Again, a person simply retelling stories he had heard.\n\n \n I did not claim Josephus was an eyewitness to Jesus' crucifixion, DamEtal.\n \n \nAnd we should remember that there are 2 passages about Jesus in Flavius Josephus' works, and that the one that really stands out in regards to saying who Jesus \"really was\" is considered to be either a completely fabricated, later passage added by Christians, or a doctored form of Josephus' original, with the forging being done by Christians to change the original mere mention of Jesus into a claimed historical account of Jesus being the supernatural Christ.\n\n \n The question thus far is the historicity of Jesus being crucified. I have consequently limited my quotations from Josephus to An 18.3.3, where the crucifixion is mentioned.\n \n There is no doubt that said passage contains interpolations, which is why I quoted the reconstructed Testimonium of Meier (1991). As it stands, there is nothing in it that could not have been said by a Jew like Josephus.\n \n \nSo unfortunately, since Christians were the ones who maintained Josephus' works over the years (because Jews considered him a 'traitor' to the Romans), and we have a very good case of them having fiddled around with Josephus' works, these statements about Jesus are highly suspect.\n\n \n Why do you think the portion of the Testimonium I quoted was interpolated by a Christian pen?\n \n While we're on the subject, why do you think the other, shorter passage at An 20.9.1 contains any interpolations?\n \n \nAlso, Josephus mentions many other people named Jesus, and devotes about the same number of words to them as to Jesus \"Christ\". Hardly what one would expect if Josephus really believed \"our\" Jesus to be the true Son of God who was sent to Earth to die for the sins of the world.\n\n \n No one said Josephus thought Jesus was \"the true Son of God who was sent to earth to die for the sins of the world,\" DamEtal.\n \n \n1) This does not show that a man named Jesus of Nazareth was actually crucified.\n\n \n I presented a host of evidence that Jesus was actually crucified.\n \n \n2) This does not show that a man named Jesus of Nazareth actually existed. For example, that a man named Bill O'Mally of Bethseda would have been crucified in first century Palestine if he had been convicted of trying to overthrow Roman rule, does not show that a man named Bill O'Mally of Bethseda actually lived in first century Palestine.\n\n \n I presented a host of evidence that Jesus was crucified in first century Palestine.\n \n \n3) This does not show that Jesus was supernatural, or any of the other claims about Him (such as His having died for the sins of the world).\n\n \n I did not make either of these claims.\n \n Lets recap, shall we?\n \n I presented several indepedent first and early second century documents attesting to the fact that a man named Jesus was crucified, specifically under Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. You responded to this by pointing out that none of them were eyewitnesses, an issue that I have never contested and did not raise. Why you think this is so important, im not entirely sure. Surely secondary sources are not necessarily wrong? And if they are incorrect in this case, if Jesus' crucifixion was not a historical event, how do you account for this evidence? Was it fabricated whole-cloth? If so, why do you think so? By who? When? What is the evidence for it?\n \n It is insufficent to simply say \"thats made up.\"",

   "Earl Doherty makes several good points about the Testimonium Flavianum, specifically when he considers the mindset, or the obvious bias which Josephus labored under in his work. He rails unmercifully at the comings and goings of strange \"holy men\" who were undermining the stability of Jerusalem during the period in question. Indeed, he faults these quacks for the fall of the city. It is not clear why he would suspend his open hostility and make an exception for Jesus.\n\n \n But Jesus isnt the only prophet Josephus' describes in more neutral terms. Aside from more traditional folks like Elisha, Josephus is relatively kind to, for example, JBap (An 18.5.2).\n \n \nOne of the main reasons the passage should be considered spurious--again with a Doherty observation--is how the flow of the narrative is interrupted. Even with my untrained eye, I encounter an obvious clunk in the story, especially when reading the preceding and subsequent paragraphs, which restore the flow when the questionable paragraph is omitted. Suspicious.\n\n \n Josephus was prone to digressions, and, as Meier (1991, p.86) observes, \"the account of Jesus (who is crucified by Pilate),\" is anchored \"by a story about Pilate in which many Jews are killed (Ant. 18.3.2, 60-62),\" preceeding it and \"by a story in which the tricksters are punished by crucifixion,\" afterwards.\n \n A real problem though is that 18.3.4 begins with \"about the same time also another sad calamity put the Jews into disorder,\" which fits much better with the events in 18.3.2 than 18.3.3.",

Could he have done the same with Polycarp, since, as he said to Florinus (HE 5.20.5), he was but a child at the time he supposedly heard it?\n\n \n Direct Historical Evidence for the Apostle John's Authorship\n \n If, as is demanded by the character of the historical question, we first consult the historical testimony of the past, we discover the universally admitted fact that, from the eighteenth century back to at least the third, the Apostle John was accepted without question as the author of the Fourth Gospel. In the examination of evidence therefore, we may begin with the third century, and thence proceed back to the time of the Apostles.\n \n The ancient manuscripts and translations of the Gospel constitute the first group of evidence. In the titles, tables of contents, signatures, which are usually added to the text of the separate Gospels, John is in every case and without the faintest indication of doubt named as the author of this Gospel. The earliest of the extant manuscripts, it is true, do not date back beyond the middle of the fourth century, but the perfect unanimity of all the codices proves to every critic that the prototypes of these manuscripts, at a much earlier date, must have contained the same indications of authorship. Similar is the testimony of the Gospel translations, of which the Syrian, Coptic, and Old Latin extend back in their earliest forms to the second century.\n \n The evidence given by the early ecclesiastical authors, whose reference to questions of authorship is but incidental, agrees with that of the above mentioned sources. St. Dionysius of Alexandria (264-5), it is true, sought for a different author for the Apocalypse, owing to the special difficulties which were being then urged by the Millennarianists in Egypt; but he always took for granted as an undoubted fact that the Apostle John was the author of the Fourth Gospel. Equally clear is the testimony of Origen (d. 254). He knew from the tradition of the Church that John was the last of the Evangelists to compose his Gospel (Eusebius, \"Hist. eccl.\", VI, xxv, 6), and at least a great portion of his commentary on the Gospel of St. John, in which he everywhere makes clear his conviction of the Apostolic origin of the work has come down to us. Origen's teacher, Clement of Alexandria (d. before 215-6), relates as \" the tradition of the old presbyters\", that the Apostle John, the last of the Evangelists, \"filled with the Holy Ghost, had written a spiritual Gospel\" (Eusebius, op. cit., VI, xiv, 7). \n \n Of still greater importance is the testimony of St. Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons (d. about 202), linked immediately with the Apostolic Age as he is, through his teacher Polycarp, the disciple of the Apostle John. The native country of Irenaeus (Asia Minor) and the scene of his subsequent ministry (Gaul) render him a witness of the Faith in both the Eastern and the Western Church. He cites in his writings at least one hundred verses from the Fourth Gospel, often with the remark, \"as John, the disciple of the Lord, says\". In speaking of the composition of the Four Gospels, he says of the last: \" Later John, the disciple of the Lord who rested on His breast, also wrote a Gospel, while he was residing at Ephesus in Asia\" (Adv. Haer., III, i, n. 2). As here, so also in the other texts it is clear that by \"John, the disciple of the Lord,\" he means none other than the Apostle John.\n \n We find that the same conviction concerning the authorship of the Fourth Gospel is expressed at greater length in the Roman Church, about 170, by the writer of the Muratorian Fragment (lines 9-34). Bishop Theophilus of Antioch in Syria (before 181) also cites the beginning of the Fourth Gospel as the words of John (Ad Autolycum, II, xxii). Finally, according to the testimony of a Vatican manuscript (Codex Regin Sueci seu Alexandrinus, 14), Bishop Papias of Hierapolis in Phrygia, an immediate disciple of the Apostle John, included in his great exegetical work an account of the composition of the Gospel by St. John during which he had been employed as scribe by the Apostle.\n \n It is scarcely necessary to repeat that, in the passages referred to, Papias and the other ancient writers have in mind but one John, namely the Apostle and Evangelist, and not some other Presbyter John, to be distinguished from the Apostle.

Don't be bitter for losing to me.\n \n \nGod Fearing Ath: I have provided plenty of evidence, all of which you glibly dismiss out of hand as \"stories\" without a single shred of argumentation as to why you think that and what you're proposing in its stead.\n\n \n Don't be ridiculous.\n \n 1) You presented NO evidence WHATSOEVER that Jesus was actually crucified. What you presented was evidence that many people CLAIMED that he was, with those claims being written SEVERAL DECADES AFTER the \"alleged\" event, and being SECOND HAND - AT BEST - testimonies.\n \n 2) I did give arguments as to why your offered evidences should not be uncritically accepted as valid: see (1) above, which recaps some of those I've made. I also pointed out the problem of Christian contamination of Josephus. \n \n \n \nGod Fearing Ath: The question is what explanation best accounts for the data I have provided, DamEtal.

But now I will claim one over the other.\n \n To paraphrase someone (Robert Price?) from the Jesus Seminary (IIRC), a historian can't write a book about the history of Caesar's time in Rome without including Caesar Augustus (the same with Vespasian): he is too intimately tied to so many different public events, that occurred in so many different places, and witnessed and documented by so many different sources: in short, Caesar Augustus' interactions with other historically known figures are too many and too well documented, and he is too pivotal to so many documented historical events, that it is quite unreasonable to claim that he did not exist.\n \n The same simply is not true for Jesus. Jesus' alleged interactions with known historical figures is limited to only two or so events that might be historically significant, such as King Herod's \"slaughter of the innocents\" as an attempt to have Jesus killed as a child (which does not have good historical documentation) and Jesus' trial before Pontius Pilate (which also does not have good historical documentation). \n \n You are once again comparing apples to oranges.\n \n \n \nGod Fearing Ath: I would again ask you to answer my query in the OP, but I see you're incapable.\n\n \n Nice spin job.\n \n I've made my point: you've failed to show that it is a historical fact that Jesus was actually crucified.",

The sixth hour (John 19:14-15) - \"Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour.

Matthew, Mark, and Luke, for the most part, used the Hebrew system of measuring a day: from sundown to sunup. The Roman system was from midnight to midnight. \"John wrote his gospel in Ephesus, the capital of the Roman province of Asia, and therefore in regard to the civil day he would be likely to employ the Roman reckoning.

Save yourself and us!\"\n \n But the other criminal rebuked him. \"Don't you fear God,\" he said, \"since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.\"\n \n Then he said, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\"\n \n Jesus answered him, \"I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.\"\n (Luke 23:32-43)\n \n\n \n Now, can you show me where in there \"Luke\" says that both criminals mocked Jesus early on? \n \n You can't.
