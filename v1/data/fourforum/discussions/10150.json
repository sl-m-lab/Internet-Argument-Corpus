   "How much longer are people going to let these groups refer to their discrimination as \"pro-family\" when they are clearly doing nothing but destroying families. There needs to be a way to put a stop to these people. \n \n http://www.towleroad.com/2007/07/oregons-gay-rig.html\n \n \n\"Pro-family\" groups are declaring that a petition drive to collect signatures in order to suspend two gay rights measures from taking effect as scheduled on January 1st, 2008 is enjoying \"awesome\" success.\n \n Last April, the Oregon legislature passed not only a sweeping domestic partners bill that would give same-sex couples in the state all the rights enjoyed by heterosexual couples (aside from the \"marriage\" name), but it also passed an important employment, housing, and public accomodations non-discrimination bill.\n \n Almost immediately, a group called Defense of Family and Marriage Again, spearheaded by former senator Marilyn Shannon, began a drive to overturn the bills. Said a spokesperson for the group: \"We've got 15,000 petitions out there and we're printing more. I'm willing to predict that Oregonians will vote on this in 2008.\"\n \n Should the group collect 55,179 signatures by Sept. 26, the gay rights measures will be halted from going into effect and placed for a vote on the November 2008 ballot.\n \n OregonLive reports: \"The executive director of the state's largest gay rights group, Basic Rights Oregon, said it appears that opponents will be able to round up enough signatures to keep the two laws on hold until next year's general election. 'It's unfortunate that a small group of people don't agree with basic fairness,' John Hummel said Thursday. However, Hummel predicted that gay rights supporters ultimately would prevail if the issues are placed before Oregon voters next year, since polls have shown a growing number of Oregonians back the two laws.\"\n",

There is no evidence that homosexuality, per se, does any harm to either the homosexual individual nor to others in society. There is evidence, however, that anti-gay sentiments, behavior and laws do harm gays and their families. Harm comes to children of gay parents who do not have the same societal protections as their straight counterparts. This is a key piece of information to understand. \n \n You are the legal eagle, but I believe it was the courts' opinions in Hawaii and Massachusetts that no conceivable harm could come to society from gay marriage and demonstrable harm comes to gays due to the lack of gay marriage. I may be wrong, but I think that was part of the reasoning behind those courts' decisions (and maybe other courts as well.)\n \n Therefore, I cannot conceive of any rational reason to oppose gay marriage. Let us say for the sake of argument, that you don't \"like\" the idea because it upsets tradition. Fine, but then you have no reason to oppose a domestic partnership other than a bigotry against gays. \n \n Again, if you can think of an alternative explanation, I am listening.",

   "These people are going beyond just \"not agreeing\", to actively seeking to limit the rights / benefits of gay people.\n\n \n This is precisely what I am suggesting is not necessarily bigotry.\n \n \nI tried searching but haven't come up with anything yet.\n I had a link to the California example, but am unable to find it for now.\n\n \n Ok.\n \n \nA lot of those conversations just plain baffle me.\n MARRIAGE is a right. Period.\n Whether or not a specific example of marriage should be recognized is a separate subject.\n\n \n Both of these, of course, are your opinion. That obviously is not bad, but there are others who would disagree with both of these statements.\n \n \nBut as to your last statement, I disagree.\n If I were to disagree that blacks should not have the right to vote, that would be obvious bigotry.\n\n \n First, I assume that you mean if you were to agree with the above. And, assuming that is what you meant, I disagree. I think it would depend on the surrounding context as to why someone would propose such a policy.\n \n \nI think too many people get wrapped up in assigning bigotry connotatively required NEGATIVE impacts and unsupported basis that the word \"bigotry\" becomes overwhelmed by an assumed implication that \"bigotry\" has to include something that is negative.\n\n \n That is, of course, the purpose of its use in this thread. The connotation is pejorative. In this context it is typically used as a means to dismiss a viewpoint out of hand. I doubt that the OP used that term as a compliment in the title of this thread. Would you disagree with that?\n \n And, as the thread has progressed, we have seen that this is apparently the view of several people. For example:\n \n I asked:\n The fact that they oppose the measure somehow means that they are bigoted?\n You replied:\n Yes. They want to hamper the rights of homosexuals, and make them subordinate to the rights of heterosexuals.\n I'm sure you don't mean the word bigot to be a compliment.\n \n Consider another reply:\n If you can suggest a motivation for this other than bigotry, I would be interested.\n Furthermore, bigotry as it is used in this thread is not only intentionally used in a pejorative sense, it is also suggested that laws based on bigotry are wrong and should not be allowed to be enacted. This is further evidence of the pejorative sense of using the word \"bigotry\" in this thread. Therefore, I do not see how the use of the term bigotry in this context can possibly be viewed as a neutral descriptive term. It is intentionally used to be pejorative. It seems to me the sense is to try and associate opposition to certain homosexual policies with racism or sexism.\n \n An interesting thing to note is that no matter what reason an opponent of gay marriage gives for his opposition, he is nevertheless labeled a bigot. Usually this is done in one of a couple of ways:\n \n 1) Either his reason(s) are described as unpersuasive, and therefore his real reason must be bigotry. OR\n \n 2) The reason he gives is based in bigotry.\n \n I think this is evidenced by comments such as, \"I don't see any reason to oppose X except bigotry.\"\n \n \ni.e. Historically when most people disapproved of interracial marriage, that was not \"bigotry\" because a majority had that opinion.\n \n But as time went by and a majority shifted to approving of interracial marriage, somehow the previously \"non-bigotted\" position suddenly became \"bigotted\".\n\n \n Bigotry describes a particular attitude. If the reason that people disapproved of interracial marriage was solely because of hatred toward a particular race, then this would be bigotry regardless of the social acceptance of interracial marriage.\n \n *Note: I have corrected this bit after I realized I didn't say everything that I wanted to.\n \n \nEssentially, an initiative created by Christians to hamper what Jews could do, and to make Judaism to have inferior rights / privileges as compared to Christianity.\n Or, Jews hampering Christians...\n \n Or whites hampering what blacks could do, so that blacks did not have as many rights / privileges as whites did.\n\n \n Strictly speaking, in our society a majority is entitled to do what it pleases so long as it does not infringe on a constitutionally protected right. In many states, as well as at the federal level, a constitutional right to, say, gay marriage has not been established. That is what separates laws aimed at religion or race from, say, laws aimed at restricting marriage to opposite gender relationships. But I'm not sure this is directly relevant to the topic of bigotry.\n \n \nQuite frankly, I think too many people have a subjective definition of \"bigotry\" whereby a racist opposing black equal rights is \"bigotted\" because they support black equal rights, but somebody opposing gay equality is not \"bigotted\" because they oppose gay equality.\n\n \n The example you gave of the bigotry of opposing interracial marriage suggests that your definition of bigotry is also subjective. I do not think that majority support of a position equivocates to non-bigotry. My main point is that bigotry has a meaning, and it has been used irresponsibly to the effect that it now practically has no meaning at all.",

   "Can you elaborate?\n Under what circumstances would a person's support for blacks to not have a right to vote not be considered as \"bigotry\"?\n (Hopefully I got the use of 'negatives' right in that sentence... ;) )\n\n \n I'll answer this question if--and only if--no one accuses me of being a racist or a bigot. My example is purely hypothetical and should not be construed as something I believe is (or ever will be) true. With that said...\n \n If one could imagine a scenario in which it could be proved beyond any doubt that people of a particular race consistently vote to overthrow the system of government in the United States, then seeking to remove the right to vote of that particular race may be done in a way that is not based in hatred toward that race. I.e., the reason supporting the policy could ultimately be rooted in something other than hatred.\n \n \nNo more than opposing a \"pro-family\" group is 'perjorative'.\n But regardless, I really don't care what connotations you personally assign to the word. Your preconceptions on the word are not my problem.\n I have given my definition, which as I explained is really free from a \"perjorative\" pretense.\n\n \n I simply do not think this is a normal construction of the term \"bigotry.\" I'll accept that when you use it that you mean it neutrally, but normally it is used negatively.\n \n \nI consider my own view to discriminate against pedophiles as \"bigotry\" to. But it is supportable bigotry.\n\n \n Again, I don't think this is a natural use of that term. Do you have hatred toward pedophiles?\n \n I would be interested to see how many people use this word in the sense you are using it.\n \n \nOn another level, what word SHOULD be used that is a synonym for \"bigotry\" but is not perjorative?\n\n \n I think this depends on what idea you would be trying to communicate. I'm not sure I know, for example, what idea you are trying to communicate when you say that you consider your own view toward pedophiles to be bigotry.\n \n \nI meant the word as a neutral application. Being neither a \"compliment\" or a \"criticism\".\n I feel that \"want to hamper the rights of homosexuals, and make them subordinate to the rights of heterosexuals\" is a negative position, but that doesn't make the term \"bigot\" a negative term in my assessment.\n\n \n I'll accept this, but I must confess that this is confusing to me. It is confusing because I think you are using the word in a special sense. I do not perceive that the OP was doing that. And, incidentally, I wonder if most people participating here would hold to this meaning of the word as well.\n \n \nI think my other statements which you are not quoting here have made it clear that is NOT the case.\n Do you disagree?\n\n \n I have no reason to question your integrity, so I'll take your word for it. But, again, I don't think this is natural. Perhaps we should search together for a better word of description.\n \n \nQuite frankly, I don't care if the reasoning is \"hatred\" or \"disapproval\" or whatever other subjective grey area term you want to use.\n I mean, the line between \"hatred\" and \"disapproval\" can be blurred just as easily as what you are complaining about with the word \"bigot\".\n\n \n This is why I said earlier that it probably is very hard to determine if someone truly is a bigot. I don't think it is as easy as seeing whether they seek to have their beliefs enacted in law.\n \n \nIf a person objected to inter-racial marriage because he didn't want the races to mix, and he wanted the races to be kept pure, would that be not bigotry to you?\n\n \n If I detected that the view was grounded in hatred, then that would be bigotry. I have qualified this a bit for the simple reason that there once were people who believed that the races should not mix, but they changed their mind. This would lead me to believe that their view might not have been rooted in hatred but rather in some other viewpoint.\n \n \nOn the contrary, it is DIRECTLY relevant.\n You are apparently introducing a new standard by which something is no longer declared as \"bigotry\", unless you abandoned the context of my analogy in your response.\n \n I was asking about those situations and how they would fit in with classifications of \"bigotry\".\n If you are saying that they are not \"bigotry\", then it would appear that constitutionality would be providing a new standard for what is considered as \"bigotry\".\n\n \n I was not trying to introduce a new standard. I think I would need a more specific hypothetical before I could give an answer. I would agree that both examples would amount to discrimination, but I do not use the words \"discrimination\" and \"bigotry\" interchangeably.\n \n \nHow does my example of \"opposing interracial marriage\" demonstrate a subjective definition of bigotry?\n There is no explanation for this allegation.\n\n \n First, please don't try to construe my points as allegations. I am trying to work civilly and in good faith toward a constructive discussion. Sometimes my points may not be as clear in my writing as they are in my head. But I am rarely out to get somebody.\n \n Now, let me try to clarify a little. The phrase in question is the following, written by you:\n i.e. Historically when most people disapproved of interracial marriage, that was not \"bigotry\" because a majority had that opinion.\n But as time went by and a majority shifted to approving of interracial marriage, somehow the previously \"non-bigotted\" position suddenly became \"bigotted\".\n As I understand this phrase, you are suggesting that when a majority has a particular opinion, then it is not bigotry. I think that gives the term a fluid meaning in which some belief is not bigotry in 1940, but the same belief is bigotry in 2007. If that is true, then this gives the word subjective meaning.\n \n And, for good measure, a response to something you said earlier to jyoshu:\n \n \nQuite frankly, I have tried to avoid using it, even though I find it highly accurate in a LOT of cases, because people like Phyllis and Jyoshu devolve the conversation into meaningless strawman arguments about how some people are supposedly labelling others as bigots JUST for disagreeing.\n\n \n I simply say that you are apparently using the term in a different way than either I or jyoshu would understand it. That was not clear to me from the beginning. I'll concede that YOU may not be labeling others as bigots for simply disagreeing, but I still stand by my statements as that term is normally used and understood. As an example of our vastly divergent usages of the word I offer the following example:\n \n I gather under your understanding of the word \"bigotry\" that it would be thought of as a good thing to base some laws in bigotry. Thus, you presumably would support laws that both criminalize pedophilia and render punishment to pedophiles.\n \n I, on the other hand, under my understanding of the word \"bigotry\" would think it improper to ever base a law on bigotry, though I too would support laws criminalizing the behavior above.\n \n All that to say that neither I (nor probably jyoshu) are trying to set up strawman arguments, nor are we trying to sidetrack the conversation.",

You may not be persuaded by that, but it certainly is not bigotry. This is simply one common example, and it also has withstood judicial scrutiny.\n \n \nPost #27: However, I have a hard time understanding the point of view of someone who would oppose legislation such as this. If it is your (subjective) opinion that homosexuality is wrong, that is fine. You may have that opinion and choose for yourself to avoid homosexuality in your life. If, however, it is your opinion that homosexuality is wrong for other people, you need to have a rational basis for it. Saying that your religion forbids it cannot extend to others outside your beliefs, and should have no basis in law anyway.\n\n \n I disagree with this. Why cannot one try to see their values enacted in law? Where does this rational basis standard come from, and why do you propose that everyone must abide by what you determine to be legitimate?\n \n \nAll that is known about homosexuality explains that it is merely a part of the continuum of normal sexuality. There is no evidence that homosexuality, per se, does any harm to either the homosexual individual nor to others in society. There is evidence, however, that anti-gay sentiments, behavior and laws do harm gays and their families. Harm comes to children of gay parents who do not have the same societal protections as their straight counterparts. This is a key piece of information to understand.\n\n \n I think that this simply is a consequence of all laws. SOME people might be harmed, but society has determined that MOST people will not be. Thus, if one believes that the best place for children to be reared is in a home with parents of the opposite sex, then they rationally can restrict the marriage institution to such a composition. In other words, society has the desire to establish a norm that it thinks is best.\n \n \nYou are the legal eagle, but I believe it was the courts' opinions in Hawaii and Massachusetts that no conceivable harm could come to society from gay marriage and demonstrable harm comes to gays due to the lack of gay marriage. I may be wrong, but I think that was part of the reasoning behind those courts' decisions (and maybe other courts as well.)\n\n \n I have read most of the various state decisions, but it has been a while. My memory is rusty, but I don't recall this type of statement. On its face it sounds to me more like what a legislature would take into consideration rather than a court.\n \n \nTherefore, I cannot conceive of any rational reason to oppose gay marriage. Let us say for the sake of argument, that you don't \"like\" the idea because it upsets tradition. Fine, but then you have no reason to oppose a domestic partnership other than a bigotry against gays.\n \n Again, if you can think of an alternative explanation, I am listening.\n \n\n \n I think the same justification I cited above regarding gay marriage would also apply here. This is a shot in the dark because I do not know the specifics of the Oregon legislation being opposed. Maybe I'll see if I can look that up.\n \n As for your post #29, if any of those individuals are participating in the initiative drive, then some (I'm not sure if all) could certainly be considered hypocrites or liars.

Therefore, it is not necessary for a compelling state interest to be present.\n \n My legislature comment, I think, speaks for itself. The phrase you mentioned seems on its face to be something that a legislature could consider, but not something that a judiciary should.\n \n \nMaybe not. I think it is however reasonable to assume, considering the level of anti-gay bigotry that does already exist, that many who would be hypocrites or liars in this regard would do so on the basis of bigotry.\n\n \n Yet your assumption, which is necessary for your conclusion to even be reasonable (let alone true) is not and has not been substantiated.

   "The second example I gave has happened before, and is therefore not merely hypothetical. Also, given the current debate surrounding immigration, a quite similar phenomenon could be observed.\n This is wholly unreasonable. You think that most of the \"defense of marriage\" folks are bigots? On what grounds? That is the crux of this entire conversation. What grounds do you have? I have already shown you one reason that many people cite as a reason to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples. I have shown that such reason is not bigotry. It is utterly ridiculous for you to conclude that most of the \"defense of marriage\" folks are bigots.\n Generally speaking, I am concerned about the tone of this discussion--the discussion between pro and anti gay marriage supporters. You can't just call somebody a bigot simply because they happen to disagree with your position on this issue. You can't even call them a bigot because they want to have their position enacted in the law. That is what I am particularly interested in here.\n This is what I said. I knew you wouldn't be persuaded by it, but the point is that it is a reason apart from bigotry, which is something you said you simply could not conceive to be possible. \n All I am saying is that what is rational and reasonable is different for various people. The example I gave you is a rational basis justifying the limitation of marriage.\n Then it is your job to convince society that you are right and they are wrong.\n Well, we certainly can get into the legal issues, but no court has ever evaluated gay marriage restrictions under strict scrutiny analysis. Therefore, it is not necessary for a compelling state interest to be present.\n My legislature comment, I think, speaks for itself. The phrase you mentioned seems on its face to be something that a legislature could consider, but not something that a judiciary should.\n Yet your assumption, which is necessary for your conclusion to even be reasonable (let alone true) is not and has not been substantiated. Are you suggesting there exists an overwhelming level of anti-gay bigotry? That is obviously debatable, and my posts throughout this thread are critical of that assumption.\n Again, some of them may be hypocrites and liars, but that does not show them to be bigots. Inappropriate use of the term \"bigot\" reduces its meaning significantly when it is correctly and legitimately used, and that is, in my opinion, irresponsible.\n I don't know what you say I am being defensive about. All I have said is that a certain word is thrown around inappropriately and irresponsibly in this particular thread (incidentally, I think I have proved my claim). Then you tried to get around this by saying something like \"I simply can't conceive a reason to oppose these types of measures apart from bigotry.\" I gave a very common reason that many people assert as justification for such opposition (a reason that has even withstood judicial scrutiny), and I showed that said reason is not bigotry. I don't know whether you can even say that I, as a matter of personal opinion, oppose gay marriage. I certainly have never said as much, and I likely won't ever do so.\n\n \n You are blowing smoke here. You are concerned about the \"tone\". Well I am concerned about people's lives. If the characterization of many of the anti-gay types as bigots is innaccurate, the worst that occurs is name calling. Sticks and stones. Anti-gay laws harm people. \n I am not \"persuaded\" by your argument? I don't know what argument you mean. I am well aware that many people think gay marriage would be harmful, if that's what you mean. What you do not seem to be persuaded by is the opinion of those that have analyzed the phenomenon and they conclude that there is real harm that comes from the lack of the legal protections of marriage. Can you not see what benefit there may be to a child to have her parents married? Do you gainsay the tons of evidence that demonstrate that the welfare of children is no different in gay or straight households? Can you elaborate what specific harm could result from gay marriage? \n \n Many ignorant people do not know this and have been repeatedly lied to by organizations like the defense of marriage types. (\"defense of marriage\" my XXX.) The average isolated normal folk who know nothing about gays cannot be faulted for ignorance of facts to which they have never been exposed. But the leaders of these groups who perpetuate the lies are very much at fault. They have no excuse. \n \n You simply are reframing the more important aspects of this serious social issue to a trivial concern of name calling. I do know first hand many of the people who have worked for these organizations and I can tell you they are bigots. \n \n Lastly, how dare you claim there is the level of anti-gay sentiment is debatable until you have experienced it first hand. Typical straight white talk.",

This gets us nowhere and can't possibly be accurate.\" \n 3. It is not my \"thing to call every single person here and elsewhere a bigot.\" That's an exaggeration.\n 4. My contention is that many of the folks in that organization are acting out of bigotry. Those that have been informed about the facts of the matter choose to ignore them. Worse, they knowingly spread lies. To repeat what I said in post 79, they may or may not really be bigots. One can never know what is truly in someone's heart. They just happen to be behaving very much like they are bigots.\n \n You may continue your hissy fit at any time.",

And, as far as the \"ilk\" is concerned, it's one of yours that came up with that. AA started it, i just keep putting it back in his twisted little face. So, that one you can own proudly.\n \n You and Phillis are quite bright, I'm positive that you are fine and decent people. But, just read AA's last post. Is not bigot an appropriate word? If you think it is not, then you really need to look deep inside and take another look. He just compared my marriage to having sex with an animal. If I said that about you and your wife, what would your reaction be? I mean, truly... dig deep inside and think about it if the tables were turned. I don't want to call anyone a bigot, except maybe ArseAngel. He's just plain evil. But honestly, what do you expect when we're attacked. You're not attacked on a daily basis... you need to step outside yourself and think. Is this truly what your chosen belief of your chosen god wants?\n \n Here are some simple facts here. 1. There ARE gays in this world. 2. Gays ARE marrying in the world. 3. Gays ARE raising children in this world. 4. Gays just want to live their lives and not be called reprobate, damned to hell sinners who are less than human. I don't want and do not wear my gayness on my sleeve.

   "I don't smoke.\n \n \n \n I don't recall making an argument. I gave you a reason that opponents of gay marriage have cited solely for the purpose of showing you that it is indeed possible to oppose gay marriage on grounds other than bigotry.\n \n \n \n This really beats it all. With this statement you have either proved my overall argument, or else you have erected a strawman.\n \n What I said was debatable was your suggestion that there exists an overwhelming level of anti-gay bigotry. You go after me for supposedly suggesting that there is not a great degree of anti-gay sentiment.\n \n Now your change of my statement somehow must be rectified. Perhaps you think that all anti-gay sentiment amounts to bigotry. If this were true, then changing my statement is reasonable. But it also proves my original point regarding the tendency of people to call someone a bigot simply because they do not adhere to a particular viewpoint. This is what I have argued needs to stop.\n \n If, on the other hand, you do not equivocate the words bigotry and sentiment, then the only other possible explanation is that you have erected a strawman and attack me for a statement that I never made.\n \n ********\n \n I have tried to carry out this discussion respectfully, reasonably, and charitably. I have a view and I have tried to express it clearly and respectfully. I really wish people would stop using the particular term in question, and until that happens, I really do not see any possibility for progress in pro-gay/anti-gay policy discussions. It has been suggested that my view doesn't really matter; that I am simply quibbling over something stupid; that my concerns are merely \"trivial\"; that I am simply \"blowing smoke.\" Well, I disagree with that, and I think I have sufficiently articulated why I disagree. I think the discussion has run its course, and thus I am prepared to bow out here and let the record speak for itself. But I'll probably be back the next time a thread is started that seeks to unjustifiably label a group of people as bigots.\n\n \n What anti-gay sentiment is not bigotry? \n How is one \"reasonably, respectfully and charitably\" anti-gay?\n (\"All I did was express anti-black sentiments and it was misconstrued as racism! Don't that beat all?\")\n \n Until you address my factual arguments that refuted your ostensibly unbigoted reasons for opposing gay marriage, rather than quibbling over word use, I cannot consider you reasonable. You have been far from charitable and I feel no respect from you when you ignore my questions to you. \n Look, counselor, with each post you really do sound more and more like a bigot. You don't want to think of yourself as one, clearly. Maybe that is why this upsets you so terribly. \n \n By the way, are you thinking of volunteering for the \"defense of marriage\" campaign?",

   "The FACT is foundit, that the gay issue has nothing at all to do with gender legally speaking.\n\n The fact that you not only say that, but actually believe it, is a testament to your inane insistence on ignorance.\n Your side insists on defining marriage as \"one man and one woman\", so as to exclude \"one man and another man\", or \"one woman and another woman\".\n \n What's the difference?\n GENDER.\n \n But please. Continue to try and deny the obvious.\n It's entertaining! emoticon_smile \n \n \n \nThis is why the only proper term for what you are seeking is special rights under the Law.\n\n 1) If you can show me any legal dictionary which defines \"special rights\", I would be most gratified. And surprised.\n \"Special rights\" is a phrase that the right dreamed up. It's not a \"proper term\" \"under the law\" at all.\n \n 2) I am routinely amazed at how people like you can pretend gays are asking for a \"special right\", when all we are really doing is asking for equality.\n Straights are currently the ones who have a \"special right\" with marriage.\n Marriage caters EXCLUSIVELY to the straight persuasion, and excludes the gay persuasion.\n \n \n \nBecause marriage is available to both genders whether they be straight or gay.\n\n That's like outlawing using the cross in religious ceremonies, and mandating the star of david be present in the religious establishments, and pretending that christianity has \"freedom of religion\".\n \n The same argument you pose was first used against interracial marriage, claiming that both blacks and whites could get married.\n \n Equality doesn't talk about people's CAPABILITY to do something.\n It talks about an EQUAL capability.\n \n \n \nThe fact that incest has nothing to do with gender just proves that gender isn't the issue, but the definition of marriage is. And if 2 members of the same gender can marry ...\n\n I can't help but notice how easily and quickly you contradict yourself, yet you're clueless in doing it.\n You claim that gender isn't the issue, but then you turn around and talk about how 2 members of the same gender cannot marry.\n :xbanghead \n \n Just out of curiousity, does ANYBODY on this message board find you a rational and credible source?",

You do have a pathalogical fantasy about what we gays do behind our bedroom doors. And, your inate hatred is obvious.

Isn't it at all possible that they are speaking a hard truth in love in order to save your life, and only someone who truly loves you would share so difficult a truth ?\n\n \n You certainly love using the \"T\" word. But, I don't think you really know what that means. You have blatently lied, name-called, harrassed people on these forums. If that's your \"Truth\", Archie, then keep that and your pseudo christian morality to yourself.\n \n \nOf course you wouldn't see it that way, but someday you will surely look back on my words and condemn YOURSELF for hating me for the truth I shared with you.\n\n \n I don't hate you, I don't know you. You are so arrogant. You, my dear, are simply not that important. But, no I don't hate you. I just hate your chosen beliefs of your chosen god. I just hate the way you twist truths around to hide your insecurity of your sexuality. Face it, your religious diatribes are a pathological attempt to cover up a deeper problem with your sick mind. No, I don't think your gay. Don't go there. But you definitely have some major issues with your sexuality. I just wonder what happened to you to make you filled with such hate towards gays. \n \n \nYou keep implying that because you label me negatively, then it is so JSD. You fail to understand that being labeled a bigot by a pervert is a compliment because the only thing I am bigoted against is the perversions you call your chosen lifestyle. \n\n \n Gee Archie, I can say to you... You keep implying that because you label me a reprobate, condemned, pervert, beastility inclined, unhappy heathen, makes it so. You fail to understand that being labeled all these things by a religious nutcase is actually a compliment. Because the real truth is that your deity complex (\"ArchAngel\"... give me a break) is just plan fun to kick around. So, keep up the christian love, baby, you're just doing a smashing job swaying people to your hate-mongering views.\n \n \n \nAs usual you and your cohorts want it both ways and you hate me for not allowing it.

I like \"ilk\" better. And, you really have a superiority complex if you think that anyone here spends their time and energy hating YOU. Truth is, no one cares. We laugh at you.\n \n You just love the \"reprobate\" word. New name for you. ReprobateIlkAngel. Perfect.\n \n \nBut if I dare to respond to your hate and immoral and bigoted propaganda with a truth that completely exposes how unnatural and immoral the values you represent are, then you accuse me of being a bad example of a Christian.

You really have problems man. If one were to read through the majority of your posts, one would just see a pathetic fundamentalist zealot.\n \n Christ was not the son of God. The Bible is not true. But that's MY view. You can believe what you want, but man... There's been too much bloodshed in the name of religion in ths world. You can keep it. And keep it out of my life\n \n \nAnd you keep saying that straights also have anal sex as if that justifies that gays do it too. Are you so shallow that you can justify your sin because others do it too ? Of course you are. Forgive my stupid question.\n\n \n shallow AA? My friends would consider me anything but. IF you think anal sex is a sin, then don't do it. But YOU are the one that brings it up over and over. It's YOUR obsession, certainly not mine. You shallowly dwindle my love I have for my husband to an anus. But don't be hypocrite, AA, go after the <40% of the straights that do it too! Seems to me a little shallow, doesn't it?\n \n For all your pursuits in your religion and all the knowledge you have garnered, I have to admit, you are one nasty human being. I don't hate you. I'm not sure I really hate anyone in this world; however, I certainly know I wouldn't like you if I met you.\n \n You can make all these crazy nasty rants all you want AA, but gays ARE married in this world. gays ARE raising children.

   "Oh. Well now. That's different. \n \n I truly assumed when you gave me the reason one would oppose gay marriage that you accepted that as a reasonable position yourself. I inferred your position on this matter incorrectly. My apologies.\n\n \n I appreciate your apology.\n \n \nI have already conceded (repeatedly) that someone more ignorant than you might be willing to swallow such an unfounded and wholely refutable point of view, and that would not be bigotry, but merely ignorance. I know someone as intelligent and erudite as you would not be duped by such silliness.\n\n \n While it is very difficult to detect tone from a post on an online forum, this seems to me to possibly be patronizing. I do think that the reason I stated beforehand is reasonable, and I also think it can be reasonably held by intelligent individuals. Incidentally, that is not only my opinion; it is also the opinion of several courts. Please do not try to extract a viewpoint from my posts (or from my silence) as to the ignorance of certain people.\n \n \nIt is my foolishness to not consider that you might refuse to admit your position on gay marriage in a thread on gay marriage in a gay rights forum. Again, my apologies for making this crazy presumption. You do realize, of course, that your unwillingness to state your position of this topic really does speak volumes.\n\n \n As you know, I typically restrain myself to discussing the particular legal issues surrounding a given policy proposal on these forums. Thus, I generally do not elaborate or focus on my personal views in order to be able to evaluate legal arguments apart from personal bias. I think this is an important thing for those whose interest lies in legal questions.\n \n I have, I confess, diverted from my typical posting in this particular thread. That is merely because I happen to object to an underhanded and unjustifiable labeling of one group as bigots. I think this issue is one where reasonable people can disagree. And this, perhaps, explains my interest in the legal process. I happen to think that the best way to solve these issues is through the democratic process. Hence, I do not really think my personal opinion matters in the grand scheme of things. I do, however, think it is important that everyone's opinion counts equally.\n \n Also, I do not know what volumes my silence speaks. Perhaps you could enlighten me on this.\n \n \nWould you concede that someone who intransigently sticks to some position, even after they have been presented firm evidence that convincingly counters that position, might do so out of bigotry?\n\n \n I think that anyone can be a bigot, even if they base their opinions on firmly established scientific data. This goes to the heart of my contention: I think it is very difficult (though not impossible) to determine that someone is acting out of bigotry. I do no think it is as easy as looking at a group of people and determining that most of them are likely to be bigots simply because they advocate a policy through the democratic process.",

These facts, whether considered separately or together, only reveal that I am neither a member of the select number of attorneys seeking to overturn democratic processes by judicial fiat, nor a member of the vast group of individuals using a particular term irresponsibly.
