   "Coulter discusses liberal use of gay people as a means to an end in her latest editorial . . .\n \n http://www.anncoulter.com/\n \n \"So now liberals are lashing out at the gays. Two weeks ago, The New York Times turned over half of its op-ed page to outing gays with some connection to Republicans. There is no principled or intellectual basis for these outings. Conservatives don't want gays to die; we just don't want to transform the Pentagon into the Office of Gay Studies. \n By contrast, liberals say: \"We love gay people! Gay people are awesome! Being gay is awesome! Gay marriage is awesome! Gay cartoon characters are awesome! And if you don't agree with us, we'll punish you by telling everyone that you're gay!\" \n In addition to an attack on a Web site reporter for supposedly operating a gay escort service and thereby cutting into the business of the Village Voice, another Times op-ed article the same day gratuitously outed the children of prominent conservatives. \n These are not public figures. No one knows who they are apart from their famous parents. I didn't even know most of these conservatives had children until the Times outed them.\"",

   "Put simply, the New York Times does not represent the beliefs and values of liberals. It is a single, specific media source consisting of a very small number of people. This specific source, although supporting liberal candidates, is a very poor indication of liberal opinion and actions as a whole. Certainly I would not be justified in pointing at a group of small people who murders minorities and claiming that the conservatives are murderers, even though that small group likely supports conservative candidates. \n \n Ann Coulter tends to look for the most absurd individual liberal act by a liberal she can find, them make her point by generalizing those actions across all liberals. It sounds accurate because she's quoting facts and actions of liberals, but realistically it is a false generalization of individual actions across a whole group. In truth, she would have been just as accurate claiming that \"newspapers are using gay people\" or \"New York is using gay people\", even though no other newspapers are not doing this, and no one else in New York is not doing this. Lots of people in the media are guilty of this same thing; I think just about every person who claims \"liberals are doing this\" or \"conservatives are doing that\" is guilty of this, but they remain popular because people want to believe the worst about their opponents, and it's a difficult act to see through.\n \n That being said, the Times was probably outing Republicans as both an attempt to defame them but also an attempt to show Republicans that some people they held in high esteem are gay, and perhaps help them realize that gay people are not all that different, are not deserving of different rights.\n \n The Times was wrong for invading the privacy of Republicans when doing so may get them removed from office because of their sexual orientation, but I doubt they view being gay as an insult, a defamation, or an attack. It is likely that they are both trying to promote acceptance homosexuality as well as using it as a weapon. That doesn't make using it as a weapon okay, but it doesn't mean they view gays only as a tool, either.",

   "You have to be kiding about the New York Times--it has long been considered by many in this country as the height of liberalism in media.\n\n \n Is that so? I wonder who these many people are; I certainly do not consider the Times the height of liberalism. Then perhaps I should consider Rush Limbaugh the height of conservatism. Although both might subscribe to conservative or liberal values, they are specific voices, not the voice of the whole.\n \n \nI agree Coulter definitely has enemies--she's among the most outspoken conservative columninsts. However, I don't think it's a stretch at all to say that many highly political liberals would jump at the chance to out high profile republicans, and that is what Coulter was addressing.\n\n \n Oh, well that would probably be the case, simply because any politician who isn't willing to do what it takes to win an election isn't going to get elected. To flip the situation around, do you think a Republican would hesitate to point out that a Democrat opposes environmental protections? Certainly not. Even though it is typically Republican to oppose environmental protections, a politician will attack his opponent where he can. This does not mean that Republicans don't actually care about environmental protections, just as it does not mean that Democrats don't actually care about gay rights, but both will attack his opponent in any way possible in order to win. \n \n \nIt's no myth that much of the media is liberal--I've read polls conducted among journalists and they heavily favored liberal ideas. I think part of the reason is that there is perception out there that somehow free speech is only championed by the left; of course it's championed by both.\n\n \n Well, the myth comes in because some conservatives have in the past supported banning flag burning, banning speaking out against the president, and using taxpayer money to promote Christianity. Certainly not all conservatives support these things.\n \n I think that the media tends to be liberal because of two reasons: \n \n First they tend to be well-educated, and education tends to both dispel prejudices and promote science. Prejudice may not be a foundation of conservatism, but speaking to conservatives leads me to believe that some people are conservative because of prejudices held regarding sexual orienation, religion, and wealth. Promoting science may not seem to counteract conservatism except that the further you get into science, the less things there are which cannot be explained. When there are few unexplainable events, people who tend to be uncertain about religion tend to end up holding it in lower importance, and their values are less likely to be based on religion.\n \n Perhaps most important factor in the type of education those in the media recieve is that it is a more artistic and creative education. A degree in English encourages people to be creative, to think outside the boundaries, and not to just plagarize the ideas of those who came before them. Because of this, they don't hold traditional views very dearly. This varies from, say, a degree in economics, which is more likely to make someone conservative.\n \n Second, their position forces them to meet a lot of people. Statistics show the more interaction you've had with a gay person, the more likely you are to support gay rights. You can better feel the pain of another when you meet that person and see that he or she isn't as different from yourself. The same likely applies to poor and homeless people, to people who want to have an abortion, and to people of different religions.\n \n It appears to me that the more conservative people in the media tend to be those with a higher income who don't engage in the type of reporting that forces them to meet a diverse set of people face-to-face.\n \n It should not be surprising if my description makes it sound as though liberalism is a more valid point of view. I am a liberal after all, and my views on this subject do support that decision. What is your take on these views?",

I think a more accurate term is \"elitism\", which furthers the idea that (in this case) liberalism is the more educated approach and conservatism is the more ignorant. That sounds attractive to a liberal, of course. To a conservative, it smacks of the very sort of values this country was founded to get away from: aristocratic elitism. \n \n One could just as easily argue that while liberals may in general be more educated, conservatives tend to be more about the common people and the issues they face.

Statistics show the more interaction you've had with a gay person, the more likely you are to support gay rights. \n\n \n Most journalists in fact probably don't meet that many people--the ones who do field work do.

But I do think that an education destroys some myths and prejudices which some conservatives use to justify their position. There are myths and prejudices held by liberals which are not dispeled by education.\n \n \nOne could just as easily argue that while liberals may in general be more educated, conservatives tend to be more about the common people and the issues they face. Perhaps that is indeed why conservatives are the ones in power in this country right now.\n\n \n This is a very well-structured paragraph and point! In fact, I do think that conservatives stand for the common people and the issues they face, and I do think that this is the reason that conservatives are in power. Actually, the liberal tendency to stand for the uncommon man is precisely why I am a liberal; I feel that the uncommon man is too often treated unfairly. This is what I mean about education. Education tends to dispel myths that the common man holds about the uncommon man.\n \n \nI also think you put too much emphasis on the role religion plays in this, but that's just my opinion.\n\n \n You may be right indeed.\n \n \nMost journalists in fact probably don't meet that many people--the ones who do field work do. News anchors for instance, have staff that do most of their investigative and interview work, unless it's a BIG televised interview on special shows like Nightline or 20/20.\n\n \n But most journalists begin by working in the field, do they not? Well, I don't know about news anchors, though. But are news anchors truly more often liberal than conservative? It is those that must research and write the stories whose bias tends to be seen.\n \n \nI would say that meeting people would bring more sympathy no matter what the case--even if they spend time meeting with the conservatives who don't agree with the morality of homosexuality, and see in fact that they aren't in fact so much like the gay lobby portrays them after all.

(I'm not a Fallwell fan, but I bet he's not exactly the money-hungry tycoon your side sometimes tries to portray him as.) So I'd say your statements go both ways.\n\n \n It probably does go both ways except that one who has met both gay people and gay rights opponent is more likely to side with the gay person because meeting a gay person greatly reduces the idea that gay people are bad, promiscuous people who are dangerous to society and children. Meeting a gay person can change one's opinion of gay people, but meeting an opponent of gay rights will not likely do that. The same can apply to many issues; watching forests get torn down or water get polluted is likely to increase support of environmental protections, but it isn't obvious that a company needs less restrictions in order to operate when you visit that company. Meeting a person on welfare can better your opinion of someone on welfare, but meeting a person who opposes welfare is not likely to lessen your opinion of someone on welfare. Meeting someone whose life be difficult without an abortion may increase your support of abortion, but meeting someone who is pro-life will likely not decrease your support of abortion.\n \n What I mean is that meeting the people who are affected by an issue is a lot different than meeting someone who simply holds a particular view on an issue that does not affect them. When you learn who the uncommon man is, you sympathize with his pain and you realize that the common man is no better than the uncommon man. The Democratic party has been referred to as the \"Great Other\" party for good reason, perhaps; it is the party which works for the rights of anyone who is the other man, the one who isn't so common.\n \n As for Jerry Falwell, I don't call him a bigot. He is wrong and harmful in many things he says and does, but no one is right all the time. I would imagine he has good intentions despite those he hurts.\n \n \nYet journalists don't sympathize as much that direction, so one has to assume they still act on preconceived ideologies rather than having their opinions changed through meeting people. Or maybe they just only interview one side.\n\n \n Well, why do you think it is that even though there are many conservatives in this nation, more people in the media tend to be liberal? Again, I think it has to do both with their education and the type of work they do.\n \n \nLike who? Bill O'Reilly probably meets LOTS of people. So does Sean Hannity. And I'm also not sure from where you could base your view that conservative media tend to be those with a igher income. Perhaps you could elaborate on this.\n\n \n Well, Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity meet lots of people, but they don't meet a diverse set of people; they don't meet the people who are affected by the issues they support or reject. When they do, it's maybe just some caller who they associate only with the position that caller takes on an issue; it isn't a face-to-face conversation with that person with the intent to learn who that person is. And by the time they began meeting large numbers of people, Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly had already been associated with a conservative viewpoint, so people with different views would be immediately hostile.\n \n As for those with a higher income, well Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity have very high incomes. Rush Limbaugh has a very high income. The average newspaper reporter? Not very high. I shouldn't say there are no liberal media members with a high income, just that I don't hear of many conservative media members without a high income. Though after considering this further, it may be true that there are simply not enough conservatives in the media to notice the low-income ones. Perhaps, for example, the New York Times has a number of conservatives in it proportional to the number of conservatives in the media as a whole, but since that proportion is very low, the New York Times is seen as liberal. Hmm, well after considering that, my statement on income does not seem logically justifiable, so ignore that one.",

But even though I respect that, we can't do it; we can't have some right, some benefit that is denied to one person only because of another person's religious belief. That's just not fair; it's just not free.\n \n \nI agree with this in many cases. I have spent quite a bit of time overseas and have seen quite a bit of suffering and poverty. After seeing that, it certainly made me more sympathetic (and I also realized that there are other places that need liberal-lobbying for human rights a lot more than most ANYONE in America). But gay is a lot about behavior, not just nature. I think many gay people indeed have come to try and make their lives seem normal. Comparing someone who experience a plight he or she cannot help with someone who behaves a certain way intentionally is not a valid comparison. IMO.\n\n \n Maybe it isn't the same, but I think getting to know a gay person makes you start to wonder just why you're taking away this person's rights. You start to realize that a gay person can be a very good person who is as sure to raise his or her kids well as you are and who only wants the best for others. You think that maybe love is something that is unique to each person, something that you or I shouldn't be interfering with. You realize you could tell another person to change his or her behavior, to stop being with the one he or she loves, but you just don't understand the why you thought that was such a good idea in the first place.\n \n \nBut this is just speculation on your part.\n\n \n Yep, all of the reasons I say people are liberal or people are conservative are just speculation on my part, just my own interpretation of my own experiences and the people I've known.",

   "Put simply, the New York Times does not represent the beliefs and values of liberals. It is a single, specific media source consisting of a very small number of people.

It sounds accurate because she's quoting facts and actions of liberals, but realistically it is a false generalization of individual actions across a whole group. In truth, she would have been just as accurate claiming that \"newspapers are using gay people\" or \"New York is using gay people\", even though no other newspapers are not doing this, and no one else in New York is not doing this. Lots of people in the media are guilty of this same thing; I think just about every person who claims \"liberals are doing this\" or \"conservatives are doing that\" is guilty of this, but they remain popular because people want to believe the worst about their opponents, and it's a difficult act to see through.\n\n \n IMO, Ann Coulter uses hyperbole to demonstrate her point...as do many other political pundits.

It is likely that they are both trying to promote acceptance homosexuality as well as using it as a weapon. That doesn't make using it as a weapon okay, but it doesn't mean they view gays only as a tool, either.\n\n \n Liberals view everybody as a potential tool to be manipulated as they see fit.

It does mean, though, that the Times understands that a Republican will be far less likely to be elected if other people know that he is gay. Though some liberals may just spout tolerance for gays in order to get votes, the majority does support tolerance for gays when they claim to, and there is no reason to believe otherwise.

Tell me how Mary Cheney was used and discarded. Tell me how Alan Keyes' daughter was used and discarded. Certainly it should not surprise you to know that Mary Cheney and Alan Keyes' daughter are both strong supporters of gay rights and spoke out of their own free will.

Would it surprise you that Dick Cheney's stance on gay rights makes me view him in a far more positive light than just about any other Republican?

   "The New York Times may be influential, but that does not indicate that if the New York Times viewed gays only as a tool (and I doubt that it does) that any other liberals would do the same. The New York Times may influence others, but it does not influence all, and its hidden motives for supporting a particular issue could never be legitimately passed as the hidden motives held by any other liberal.\n\n \n The NY Times is just one of many liberal mouthpieces, but it is a powerful one, none-the-less. Let's talk about the Clintons, or John Kerry. These are three Democratic Icons and all have given lip service to gays and acted in the opposite when push came to shove post-elections.\n \n\n Ann Coulter generalizes individual faults of specific liberals across the entire party. She finds one bad side of one person and uses that to claim that an entire political ideology is faulty. Call that hyperbole if you wish, but it is hyperbole taken so far that it is a manipulation of the truth into logical nonsense.\n\n I don't know if I'd call it logical nonsense, but it is admittedly exagerated.\n \n\n I don't claim Al Franken to be any better, of course. I've never listened to him, though there is a reason I have not, and I'm sure he's just as bad.\n\n on't worry, you aren't missing anything. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n Wrong; although the Times was most certainly using the fact that someone is gay as a weapon against that person, this does not mean that the Times feels being gay is wrong. It does mean, though, that the Times understands that a Republican will be far less likely to be elected if other people know that he is gay.\n\n So, in essence, you're agreeing that the NY Times will use someone's sexual orientation against him for political purposes. I rest my case. :) \n \n\n Though some liberals may just spout tolerance for gays in order to get votes, the majority does support tolerance for gays when they claim to, and there is no reason to believe otherwise. Even if there were, I'd rather be a pawn to get someone who supports the right issues into office than be oppressed by a tyranical government.\n\n My state, Michigan is notoriously liberal. We have voted, perrenially, for such liberal scumbags as Carl Levin and John Bonior, but yet as liberal as Michigan is, the gay marriage initiative went down in flames. What happened to MI's liberals? The same thing occurred in liberal Oregon. Did those states suddenly turn Republican? Hardly. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n I'm calling you out on this one. Your take on liberals is absolutely unfounded. Liberals do not view everyone as a tool, there is no indication that they do, almost no one is so immoral as to think that, I know countless liberals well enough to show that this is not true, and I myself am a liberal who does not hold that view.\n\n I'll give you four examples of groups that have been useed as perrennial liberal pawns: illegal aliens, Seniors, kids and blacks.\n Illegal aliens:\n \n\n A report issued by the Justice Dept. in 2000 detailed a program run under the auspices of then Vice President Gore's \"Reinventing Government\" project to streamline government services. In a successful effort to clear a backlog of 1.2 million applicants, the INS engaged in this crash program called \"Citizenship USA\" to naturalize the immigrants between October 1995 and September 1996, not coincidentally, just in time for the presidential election. Douglas Farbrother, an official on Gore's team, is quoted in the report saying he \"believed that the (citizenship) program had a deadline that was directly connected to the upcoming election.\" The Clinton administration bypassed the customary FBI background check for these new citizens demonstrating that creating new Democrat voters was a much higher priority than national security. It is estimated that tens of thousands of applications were approved without FBI review. The Justice Dept. report documented 1,000 cases in Miami; 1,300 cases in Chicago; and an astonishing 2,500 cases in Los Angeles.\n \n The politicization of the INS continued in the 2000 election. As documented by journalist Joseph Farah ,on Nov. 6, 2000, (one day before the national election) the California Democratic Party sent thousands (upwards of 4 million by some estimates) of mailers out to immigrants who had citizenship requests before the INS. These non-citizens were informed, in both English and Spanish, that they were registered to vote as a Democrat and given a special identification card to \"help...voting go more smoothly.\" Follow up investigations by the press pointed to the possible use of INS records to commit this massive voter fraud. How many of the recipients took advantage of the generous offer made by the Democrats is unknown, but based on the estimates it is quite possible that Gore's much touted popular vote win (by just under a million votes) could all be attributed to this scam alone. Flaws in the system continue to be used and expanded upon to give the Left an unfair advantage in elections and to undermine the legitimacy of our most fundamental American right.\n http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=10187 \n\n \n Seniors:\n \n\n SENIORS HAIL PASSAGE OF BUSH TAX CUT\n Statement by 60 Plus Association President Jim Martin\n Washington, D.C. - \"Tax cuts benefit all of society but particularly senior citizens who live on fixed incomes,\" in the view of a national advocacy group for the elderly.\n That assessment of House passage Thursday of part of President George W. Bush's tax cut proposal was made by Jim Martin, head of the 60 Plus Association, a nonpartisan organization with 500,000 members.\n Martin emphasized that \"seniors feel safe and secure with the pledge by President Bush to protect the Social Security surplus.\n \"These surpluses are not endangered by the Bush tax cut,\" Martin stressed, \"despite what Democrats imply. It's shameful, actually it's disgraceful, for Democrats to scare seniors with talk that tax cuts jeopardize Social Security.\n \"After all, until the last Congress, Democrats spent every penny of Social Security surpluses 'like drunken sailors', as the saying goes, treating these surpluses as their own personal piggy bank to finance non-senior programs,\" Martin said.\n \"It's now the height of hypocrisy for Democrats to falsely accuse the President of jeopardizing Social Security with his tax cuts. \n http://www.60plus.org/news.asp?docID=216 \n\n \n Kids:\n \n\n Prop 200-A Common Sense Way to Protect Our Way of Life\n \n \n Paul Rollins\n SEAR Club Columnist\n Jul. 15, 2004 12:00AM\n \n \n \"A lot of kids will be going hungry if Protect Arizona Now passes. If you want to starve a kid while everyone else in his class is wolfing down his lunch, that's between you and your conscience.\" --Jeff Smith, Tucson Citizen\n \n \n \n Let the fun begin.\n \n The best barometer of sound policy is the reaction it creates with liberals. You know when they pull the \"starve the children\" card, that the policy must be good. So, why the hand wringing on the part of Mr. Smith? Because Proposition 200, a.k.a. Protect Arizona Now, appears to have met the appropriate legal requirements and in all likelihood will be on the ballot come November.\n \n The \"starving kids\" rhetoric is nothing new. Liberals tried in vain to skewer President Ronald Reagan with the same charge when his budget proposals included cuts in the federal school lunch program. This is typical liberal shtick that plays on the emotions of the uninformed. Liberals don't understand the facts, or choose to ignore them, because facts are stubborn things that are impossible to ignore. The result for the big hearted liberal is that facts create conscience-something that goes with liberalism like oil in water. It is hard to destroy marriage and abort babies with a clear conscience.\n http://www.searclub.com/?page=news-article&id=709 \n\n \n Blacks:\n \n\n It's extremely difficult for political strategists to make assumptions about white listening habits. So they typically don't make any. But the story is different with respect to blacks, who are one of the easiest voting groups to target. In places like Dallas, New York, LA, Memphis, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Atlanta and a dozen other metropolitan markets, it's not uncommon for radio stations that serve black residents to reach two-thirds of them in a given week. One-quarter of black voters watch Black Entertainment Television daily; more than 60% tune in at least weekly.\n \n Democratic operatives saturate this minority media with a campaign of negativity and misinformation that would make Michael Moore blush. Republicans are cross-burners who want to put a semiautomatic in little Jamal's hands and take money way from little LaWanda's public school. For fun on weekends, Republicans drag black men to their death behind pickup trucks with Confederate flags attached to the rear bumper. Republicans want to racially profile blacks, incarcerate them in high numbers and disenfranchise as many as possible. And so on.\n http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110005417 \n\n \n But, I'm not telling you anything new. You already knew about liberal demogoguery. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n Tell me how Mary Cheney was used and discarded. Tell me how Alan Keyes' daughter was used and discarded. \n\n Don't you find it amazing that right after the election, nobody heard another peep in the major media about Mary Cheney? Why? Because she was no longer of use to liberals. When was the last time you heard about Anita Hill? She dropped from the liberal radar right after Clarence Thomas was confirmed.\n \n\n Certainly it should not surprise you to know that Mary Cheney and Alan Keyes' daughter are both strong supporters of gay rights and spoke out of their own free will.\n\n Neither of them could get media coverage in a post-election environment, either. \n \n\n I view these women as heroes, people willing to speak out for what is right despite all the factors acting against them. Would it surprise you that Dick Cheney's stance on gay rights makes me view him in a far more positive light than just about any other Republican? I just don't see what makes you think \"liberals\" are using anyone as a tool, unless perhaps it is the words of conservative media members.\n\n \n See the above examples.",

   "Wow, you really are naive. I can't believe there are still some on the left who think either party in general really cares about the needs of gay people. \n\n \n You can keep saying that all you want, but you know it's a lie. Since the 70s, only one party has passed gay rights ordinances at local and state levels. Only one party has led gay issues on the national level. Until recently, GOP members (even the god-damned gay ones) wouldn't sign on to pro-gay legislation in the Congress.\n \n As I've said more than once, prove me wrong. Show us ANY pro-gay legislation championed by the GOP. ANY. (Massachussetts excepted, as I've also pointed out) \n \n \nYou don't seem to have any concept of what tokenism is at all.\n\n \n Tokenism? Hmmm.... let's see... A token, in a political sense, is an individual promoted to a certain position in order to make a symbolic point. Clarence Thomas' appointment was tokenism. If Bush puts a gay pawn on the SCOTUS, then he or she will be an example of gay tokenism.\n \n In the meantime, I don't think either party has engaged in gay tokenism to any significant degree -- we're not a big enough demographic, and I think any benefit to making a token appointment would still be cancelled out by the negative backlash. I can't think of a major appointment by a President of either party. There have been rumors about several Cabinet members and a couple SCOTUS Justices, but none were appointed as gay people. The few members of Congress who are gay were elected long before they came out (there may be a recent exception). There are CongressCritters of both parties. The Dem ones are out and proud. The GOP ones are out and quiet. Some Dem ones were dragged out of the closet, ALL the GOP ones were as well.

   "Your stance here has been to accept CUs as they are and to be dismissive of every other gay-rights issue on a daily basis.\n\n \n Every other issue, like what? Equal opportunity in the workplace? Gay adoption? I'm not opposing you on any of that. I support them. If you are going to claim that I am \"dismissive of every other gay-rights issue\" then show us the money and prove it. Otherwise you're either lying or you're spouting things off without making sure they're indeed true before you say them.\n \n \nThe CUs in Vermont are not federally recognized. Under the GOP, they never will be (well, maybe in a few decades, but I'll be dead and gone).\n\n \n Yep, but you don't seem to be nearly as upset with or eager to rebut Kerry on that. But hey, he IS a member of your party. (And a high profile one at that.)\n \n \nThe difference between Kerry and those on the right who, oh so reasonably, say we should accept civil unions is that he doesn't lie and pretend that CUs as they exist are acceptable.\n \n \n Sure he does, otherwise he wouldn't believe that CUs are the way to go, and would be for gay marriage. Take your head out of the sand: he's not pro-gay marriage. He only supports civil unions. I understand his position, and I agree with him. Yet you don't seem to care at all that he has that position, and you'll spend post after post opposing conservatives here who have the same position. \n \n \nPlus he, unlike you, would have been in a position to actually see to it that CUs could be federally recognized. \n\n \n Bull. I have the very same position--you're making assumptions, reckless ones at that. Why don't you just admit that you have a knee-jerl bias against conservatives and Republicans, and that is the reason you don't oppose members of your own political party when they have the very same issues Republicans do?\n \n \nFurthermore, his argument against actually marriage isn't that we're not qualified for it but that this society isn't ready for it.\n\n \n LOL. My god, you are naive. Are you sure you're not interested in the purchase of some swampland?",

   "I see providing a decent education as a responsibility of government, not an act of charity.\n\n That's one of the biggest problems that I have with liberals, in general. You all think that Uncle Sam really is a relative of yours and not a dispassionate institution whose function isn't social engineering. emoticon_mad \n \n\n Considering that the GOP Congress hasn't managed to find much to cut except funds that help the poor and the elderly, yeah, there'll be quite a fight. You can count on it.\n\n The fact is that 2/3 of the Federal Budget goes towards predominantly Liberal hard-wired programs such as SS, Medicare, Medicaid and the remaining 1/3 of discretionary funding includes all of the military spending and all other programs. The only place that Congress can cut funding is in this 1/3 area.\n \n\n On the other point, I'm starting to be a bit worried about you. First the sketchy recollection of Clinton and DADT and now this apparent memory loss of the entire Clinton presidency and much of the preceeding 20 years. Ever since your-grand-kids-can-pay-for-it Reagan, the Democrats have been urging and fighting for fiscal responsibility in Congress. In response, the GOP has abandoned one of its reasonable long-term pillars. Which party is acting like adults? Hint: not the GOP.\n\n \n Ha! Ha! Ha! Now THAT'S funny. Have you ever read the Constitution? If so, tell me what branch of government is the ONLY one that can spend Federal money. I'll help you, it's the HR and all during Reagan (in fact for 40 years up to the post 1994 election) DEMOCRATS controlled the HR.\n Tip O'Neill told Reagan that his budget was DOA and the only way he could get increased defense funding was to agree to DEMOCRATIC increases in social spending. But don't take my word for it, do the research.\n The Democrats have NEVER been concerned with a balanced budget. It was the first Republican Congress in 40 years that FORCED Clinton into signing a balanced budget. And all the while, the Democrats in Congress cried about those bad Republicans \"starving Seniors and children\".\n Who defeated the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment proposal in 1996? DEMOCRATS\n While I will agree that the current breed of Republicrat isn't as fiscally-responsible as their predecessors, Democrats have NEVER been fiscally responsible. Starting with FDR, they have a legacy of debt creation. emoticon_mad",

   "LOL. My god, you are naive. Are you sure you're not interested in the purchase of some swampland?\n\n \n Actually, I have to agree with Bob on this one. I find it highly probably that Kerry actually does support same-sex marriage but that he was compromising to give himself a shot at winning the election. Aspiring politicians are taught by campaign experts that all great politicians compromise in order to get elected. They tend to use Lincoln as an example, who was devoutly opposed to slavery yet stated that he would only stop the expansion of slavery into new states, not remove the south's current slaves. (Of course, Lincoln probably would have done just that if the civil war had not begun). They say that Lincoln did this because someone far worse would have been elected if he did not take that stance. I would not be surprised if Kerry supports same-sex marriage in his heart but only partially supports it because it is too unpopular.",

   "blah, blah, blah, kerry sucked, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, dems suck, blah, blah, blah\n\n \n Look, anyone who looks at this issue realizes that the GOP is trying to stop gay marriage AND civil unions across this country. On the other hand, the push for same-sex marriage and/or civil unions is being pushed by Democrats (not all of the, but most of them). The only exception to this is that the GOP, when it doesn't have the choice of doing nothing for gay people, pushed CUs (as they did in Vermont and as they are sort of doing in Massachussetts in a half-assed sort of way -- they'd prefer NO legal relationships).\n \n As for the specifics of Kerry vs. Bush, no, I wasn't thrilled with Kerry's position, but it light-years beyond Bush's and you and everyone else knows it. Plus, as I've said more than once, I'm much more concerned with actual rights than \"acceptance\" by people who don't particularly care for people like me. \n \n As for you, if you're such a strong believer in fully-equal, federally-recognized civil unions and support all other gay-rights issues, why do you support the GOP on gay rights? You don't agree with more than half a dozen of them, and the ones you do agree with are out of office and served in liberal states.",

He never, ever admits that he's asking gay people to give up so much to protect the feelings of religious people, never honestly addresses the competing interests, never proposes a compromise of any sort. If he really believed all the cr@p about protecting civilization, you'd think he could have someone write up a speech for him indicating the \"logic\" behind his strategy.
