   "On the non GT model, the bench seat was standard. On the GT, bench seats were pretty rare, but they were the same seat used in the standard model (in fact, you can drop the bench seat from a non GT into the GT without drilling any holes...the mounts for the bench seat line up with the outboard holes for the bucket seats). \n \n The bench seats are ewasy to come by, and run between $25 and $50 depending on condition. The buckets are hard to come by and run between $200 and $500 each, depending on condition (I restored an old mustang last year, so the prices are a year out of date). For a daily driver, you will get more using late model buckets and either having them recovered or findign some that match. It took for 80 years to figure out how to make a decent seat.",
