   "Be careful of potential scam!\n \n \n This scam is going around and I wanted to give you a 'heads up' in case you may be regular Home Depot customers. Over the last month I became a victim of a clever scam while out shopping. Simply going out to get stuff for the house has turned out to be quite traumatic. Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't happen to you. Here's how the scam works: Two seriously good-looking 20-21 year-old girls come over to your car as you are packing your shopping bags into the trunk. They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. It is impossible not to look. When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say 'No' and instead ask you for a ride to another Home Depot or Lowe's. You agree and they get in the back seat. On the way, they start having sex with each other. Then one of them climbs over into the front seat and performs oral sex on you, while the other one steals your wallet. I had my wallet stolen December 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, 17th, 20th, & 24th. Also January 2nd, 3rd, twice on the 7th, 10th & 14th, three times just yesterday and very likely again this upcoming weekend. \n So be careful.",
