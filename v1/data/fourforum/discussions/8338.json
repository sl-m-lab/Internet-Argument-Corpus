   "Historially, the Orthodox Jews have been a lot more reactionary when it comes to change. However, they have ordained their first female Rabbi.\n \n The conservatives and the Reform have been doing that for a while. Now, the orthodx have their first offically ordained woman as a rabbii. (well, almost)\n \n \n From http://jwablog.jwa.org/node/23\n \n \n\n Today I received several celebratory emails from friends, announcing the news that Haviva Ner-David, an Orthodox woman living in Jerusalem, had finally achieved her dream of being ordained a rabbi. Her quest began more than ten years ago, when she applied to the rabbinical program at the modern Orthodox Yeshiva University - an application that the administration assumed was a joke and ignored. She went on to pursue rabbinic studies privately with Rabbi Aryeh Strikovsky, an Orthodox rabbi, while also earning a PhD in Talmud - and raising five small children. Obviously a determined, smart, and courageous woman.\n \n",
