   "In several of my other post I have stated that I do not seek legislation concerning abortion. It is rather my goal to convince people to consider the possibilities of their actions so as not to put themselves in the position of needing to decide on life and death issues. I will join you in an appropriate thread to continue this so as to accomodate Dr. No.\n\n \n And so, your goal is not to reduce abortions? Your goal is to educate people on sexual activity and pregnancy?",

   "In a sentence, if people would consider the effects of their actions, they would not place themselves in the position to make life and death decisions on the innocent.\n\n \n No argument from me here. I also believe more comprehensive consideration of pregnant women's needs (and not just their pregnancy needs), even stronger sex ed (kids should be meeting people dieing from AIDS and poor mothers from the ghetto), teaching better self-esteem to girls (men are awesome - but as long as we continue to make them the main focus of a woman's life - it will lead to sex - I mean heaven forbid a girl be single and happy). I believe these types of things will do much more to reduce abortion than criminalization will. In the end a woman has to have full rights to her body - you can't make right choices when not given a choice, and sometimes abortion, sadly, may be the right choice (rape, the severely ill, severely medicated, severely addicted, et.)\n \n When I was pregnant I considered abortion because I was being denied medical care. Criminalization would not have changed that reality. What made it possible for my to continue my pregnancy was finding a way to get my needs met. But too often lifers ignore the reality and validity of a woman's needs and simply call these things \"convenience matters\" and the woman \"selfish\".\n \n Criminalization won't help reduce abortion, it will simply make things unsafe for women. I am already horrified by the number of doctors and pharmacists who are trying to hi-jack a woman's ability to make safe decisions around her health and reproduction (i.e., dispensing birth control, etc.)",

Ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? Sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. Sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. Then, if EVERYTHING fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. I doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. It will only cause suffering and fear for women.\n \n I thought we were out of the dark ages already.",

If you think that will stop it (I'm not sure if you are but that's what it sounds like in this post) then you are delusional. Ever heard of the Prohibition (18th amendment)? I think that that case clearly shows the furility of legislating against something like this. Outlawing abortion will not reduce the amount of women who become pregnant and have abortions, it will just make having abortions more dangerous for them when they have to go to back-alley clinics and such to get the procedure done.",
