The making sure we don't ***k up is what costs the real money. It's pretty sad as it is, as there are a known 23 innocent people who have been executed, and likely far more. If you want to cut costs, you cut the process that ensures we don't execute the wrong person, but then again, I'm pretty sure everyone can figure out what that will do to the innocents to guilty execution ratios.",

I completely agree with your assessment of Dukakis, and the problem is not entirely with the courts.\n \n I once closely followed the case of a fellow convicted for attempted murder in Washington state and I was shocked to learn that, once he was turned over to the state corrections system, the corrections system had total discretion over whether to keep him for the full term. The court sentence was a recommended maximum, for display purposes and public consumption only.\n \n Crime control depends on a chain of police work (where scumbags are sometimes left on the street because they are also informers), courts (where attorneys and judges sometimes game the system with technicalities that do not serve the purpose of justice), and the corrections system (where officials are sometimes too far removed from the crime to make sound judgments).

   "Well I don't know if your a Christian or not but when it comes to murdering babiesin the womb for no reason you will find you were wrong when you meet your maker.......\n \n I know I am right............\nAh, yes. Back to the threats. I don't personally murder babies, and have never heard of a baby being put into the womb. I suport the killing of foetuses in certain circumstances, and is not clear from the Bible that foetuses are persons:\n \n ''When people who are fighting injure a pregnant woman so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no further harm follows, the one responsible shall be fined what the woman's husband demands, paying as much as the judges determine.' \n \n suggests that the loss of a foetus was seen as worthy of a fine: children were after all valuable. But not worthy of death, the punishment for murder in the OT. Far more similar to the fine payed by a man who rapes a virgin and then refuses to marry her, damaging her bride-value to her father.\n \n You on the other hand openly advocate state murder which you accept is in direct contravention of Christ's laws. As a mortal sin requires:\n \n 1. subject must be 'grave matter';\n 2. it must be committed with full knowledge\n 3. it must be committed with deliberate and complete consent.\n \n I think that this is a clear example. I don't condemn others to hell, but you may wish to reconsider your beliefs.",

   "ABOUT THIS INNOCENCE PROJECT \n \n \n \n The Innocence Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law was created by Barry C. Scheck and Peter J. Neufeld in 1992. It was set up as and remains a non-profit legal clinic. This Project only handles cases where postconviction DNA testing of evidence can yield conclusive proof of innocence. As a clinic, students handle the case work while supervised by a team of attorneys and clinic staff.\n \n Most of our clients are poor, forgotten, and have used up all of their legal avenues for relief. The hope they all have is that biological evidence from their cases still exists and can be subjected to DNA testing. All Innocence Project clients go through an extensive screening process to determine whether or not DNA testing of evidence could prove their claims of innocence. Thousands currently await our evaluation of their cases.\n \n DNA testing has been a major factor in changing the criminal justice system. It has provided scientific proof that our system convicts and sentences innocent people -- and that wrongful convictions are not isolated or rare events. Most importantly, DNA testing has opened a window into wrongful convictions so that we may study the causes and propose remedies that may minimize the chances that more innocent people are convicted.\n \n As forerunners in the field of wrongful convictions, the Innocence Project has grown to become much more than the \"court of last resort\" for inmates who have exhausted their appeals and their means. We are now helping to organize The Innocence Network, a group of law schools, journalism schools, and public defender offices across the country that assists inmates trying to prove their innocence whether or not the cases involve biological evidence which can be subjected to DNA testing. We consult with legislators and law enforcement officials on the state, local, and federal level, conduct research and training, produce scholarship, and propose a wide range of remedies to prevent wrongful convictions while continuing our work to free innocent inmates through the use of postconviction DNA testing.\n \n We hope that this site will raise awareness and concern about the failings of our criminal justice system. It is a facet of our society that eventually touches all of its citizens. The prospect of innocents languishing in jail or, worse, being put to death for crimes that they did not commit should be intolerable to every American, regardless of race, politics, sex, origin, or creed.\n \n Innocence Project\n 100 Fifth Avenue, 3rd Floor\n New York, NY 10011\n \n info@innocenceproject.org\n \n \n I would also suggest the book \" The Death of Innocents \" by Sister Helen Prejean.",

   "Kirk Bloodsworth was convicted in March of 1985 for the brutal killing and sexual assault of a nine year old girl. The victim was found dead in July of 1984. She had been strangled, raped, and beaten with a rock. Bloodsworth was arrested based on an anonymous call telling police that he was seen with the victim that day and an identification made by a witness from a police sketch that was based on the recollections of five eyewitnesses. At trial, all five witnesses testified that they had seen Bloodsworth with the victim. Also presented at trial was testimony that Bloodsworth had said that he had done something terrible that day that would affect his relationship with his wife. Additionally, he mentioned a bloody rock during the investigation. A shoe impression found near the victim matched his size.\n \n This evidence was challenged in Bloodsworth's appeals, which asserted that the bloody rock was mentioned because the police showed him a rock during the interrogation. The incident he mentioned regarding his wife amounted to his failure to buy the food she had requested. Moreover, the police failed to inform the defense that there may have been another suspect. Bloodsworth's conviction was overturned by the appellate court and he was retried. This time, he was convicted and sentenced to two life terms, to run consecutively. \n \n In 1992, the prosecution agreed to DNA testing to be performed by Forensic Science Associates. The victim's shorts and underwear, a stick found at the scene, and an autopsy slide were compared against the blood standards of the victim and Bloodsworth. Using PCR based DNA testing, FSA determined that the amount of spermatozoa on the slide was insufficient for testing. Testing on the panties excluded Bloodsworth. Replicate testing performed by the FBI yielded the same results.\n \n Bloodsworth was released from prison in June 1993 and pardoned in December 1993. He had spent over eight years in prison, two of those years facing execution.\n \n Bloodsworth also became the first person to be exonerated from death row through postconviction DNA testing. The recent introduction of the Innocence Protection Act of 2003 establishes the Kirk Bloodsworth Postconviction DNA Testing Program, which will provide funding for testing under the act.
