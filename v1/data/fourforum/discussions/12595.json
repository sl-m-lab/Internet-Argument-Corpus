   "More Propaganda from the anti-gay side in an attempt to get \"ex-gays\" included in the Hate Crime Bill in Congress. They seem to be pretty desperate. \n \n \nWASHINGTON, April 20 /Christian Newswire/ -- Greg Quinlan submits the following and is available for comment:\n \n What happens when ex-gays come out of the closet? When I staffed the exhibit booth for the Ex-Gay Educators Caucus, Wayne Besen, the former spokesperson for the gay Human Rights Campaign, approached our booth to insult us for having the audacity to live as heterosexuals. He took photos for his ex-gay bashing website which targets the ex-gay community for ridicule and harassment. Mr. Besen and gay rights organizations do not believe ex-gays are entitled to the same rights and respect that gays currently enjoy. They picket ex-gay conferences and protest vigorously against ex-gay equal access. \n \n In his continuing zeal to discredit the ex-gay community, Besen likes to bully ex-gays by insisting that we still look \"gay.\" When he was Director of Communications for the Human Rights Campaign, Besen delighted in telling me to \"butch up\" so \"normal people\" wouldn't think I'm still \"gay.\" See his emails at pfox.org/Human-Rights-Campaign-Hate-Against-Ex-Gays.pdf \n \n At the booth, Besen stuck his finger in my face and called me a \"fu*king ###*ot,\" \"fu*king co*ksucker,\" \"nellie fairy,\" etc. \"You're still having gay sex,\" he yelled at me. We had to call security to remove him because we were scared for our safety. \n \n Hate against ex-gays like me is all too common. What will happen when Congress passes a Hate Crimes Prevention Act for gays? H.R. 1913 has now been introduced by Representatives John Conyers and Mark Kirk (R-IL). \n \n With their hate officially protected by law, homosexuals will determine heterosexuality by censoring ex-gay speech or behavior they disagree with as \"hateful,\" \"dangerous,\" or \"leading to physical violence.\" We know because this is what they already label us. \n \n Think twice, America. Do you want to give gay activists the right to hate under the guise of a \"civil rights\" protection? Besen has now aligned himself with Lambda Legal, the nation's largest attorneys group \"working for the civil rights of gay men.\" \n \n Please oppose the Hate Crimes Bill. Unpopular minorities like former homosexuals deserve the right to be free and out. The hate spewed against heterosexuals after they voted against genderless marriage last fall shows that the gay lobby can scare us into silence. Let's not be silent. \n \n Visit pfox.org/about_us.html on the ex-gay community.\n \n Contact your Representative at 202-225-3121 or writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml to oppose H.R. 1913.\n \n \n Gays Hating Heterosexuals",

   "Wayne Besen's Response\n \n \nMonday, April 20, 2009 \n \n \n It's Quite Sad, Really \n \n \n It is fair to say that I have officially driven the so-called \"ex-gay\" industry to distraction. The proof is in the pudding.\n \n The group, Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays (PFOX), is now trying to discredit me by making false accusations about an alleged incident in Orlando. A couple of years ago, I organized a protest in this city against the \"Ex-Gay Educators Caucus,\" which hosted a booth inside a convention hall at the National Education Association's annual meeting.\n \n Following our protest, I wandered in to the hall and approached the ex-gay booth. I did not think twice about doing so, since I had been to dozens of ex-gay meetings, booths and conferences over the years without incident.\n \n Once at the booth, I asked one question: How many ex-gay educators were in the so-called \"ex-gay caucus?\" I asked, because all I saw were professional anti-gay activists posing as legitimate educators.\n \n Before I got an answer, I was verbally and physically accosted by anti-gay activist Greg Quinlan. I told him in no uncertain terms to back off. I do not apologize for this - as it is my right to basic self-defense. I'd do it again without hesitation.\n \n In a bizarre twist, after deliberately trying to provoke a confrontation, Mr. Quinlan called the \"mall cops\" to play victim - even though he was the aggressor. It was the most bizarre thing I had seen in my 20 years of activism. The incident was as pathetic, as it was perplexing.\n \n Of course, the outcome of the non-incident was that I peacefully walked away with the mall cops and immediately went to a meeting with the GLBT educators caucus. I gave a short speech. There was no police report - not even questioning - of the alleged \"incident.\" No time in the cell block at the big house. Indeed, no one in the hall really noticed that anything had happened - because it really hadn't.\n \n Yet, PFOX is now sending out a surreal press release that exaggerates the truth and is pure fiction. Why? Because PFOX is on a pathological campaign to create fake \"hate crimes\" out of thin air against ex-gays. The group's goal is to get \"ex-gays\" included in the hate crime bill in Congress. With no real hate crimes against so-called ex-gays - PFOX had decided to invent them. Thus, if you approach a booth, they call the cops and make false charges allegations.\n \n Indeed, they did this last year at a state fair in Virginia. They blew an incident out of proportion and claimed to be victims. Interestingly, once again, there was no police report. The police did confirm that something happened - and that PFOX complained - but, again, there were no arrests and no charges filed. \n \n A few weeks later at the Falls Church fair, Mr. Quinlan tried to create another fake hate crime. Unfortunately, he threatened to call the police on Nick Benton, publisher of the Falls Church News Press. Thus, his agenda was exposed in the meia and his credibility shattered.\n \n A disturbing pattern has emerged from PFOX.\n \n 1) They buy a booth at a local fair.\n 2) They provoke a confrontation\n 3) They call the cops, even as they have no evidence, thus there are no arrests, nor police reports.\n 4) They send out propaganda to the media blowing these non-events - that they provoked - out of proportion. Or they embellish or simply make things up.\n \n In light of this creepy trend, I would strongly advise all GLBT people and their allies to stay away from PFOX booths. They are looking to create trouble because it is an organization that relies on fakery and trickery to disguise the emptiness of its mean-spirited agenda.\n \n I'm not mad, really. At this point, I just feel sorry for these folks. They can't accept their gayness and refuse to love their gay children. Instead, they have created a poisonous house of cards designed to harm their own families. PFOX and their allies are losing this battle and they have become desperate and outlandish. I just hope those involved in this organization seek the help they need - before they self-destruct in anger and bitterness.\n\n \n Wayne Besen - Author, Activist, Columnist, Public Speaker",

   "Like most things, the truth about what happened is probably somewhere in between. It seems neither person likes the other very much. Both causes have their place, though there is far greater need to protect gays than ex-gays. But then there are far less ex-gay advocates than the other way around anyway. It is kind of ironic Besen does something so hateful as accuse ex-gays of refusing to love their gay children in the very post he takes umbrage with someone not wanting to be labeled as hateful.",

If a kid makes a decision that he wants to live in a way that's ex-gay, why would you not want the parent to support their teenager, just as you would want them to support their teenager if he wanted to live as an out gay person? I don't see why it's so bad for a group to support people being the way they want to be in this case--and when so much of the gay pride movement has been geared toward rhetoric like telling people to \"stay out peoples' bedrooms\", it seems pretty double-standardish to turn right around and oppose people for supporting those who make a decision DIFFERENT from what you may think is right. It's funny how 'letting people live their lives' goes right out the window when the descision goes the other way ....",

No.\n \n The truth is that PFOX is involved in the anti-gay lobby.\n Part of their purpose (as described by Besen above) is to take offense at gays, to help paint gays as the aggressors as the group itself stands for helping to eliminate gays on a voluntary case-by-case basis.\n \n Look at the PFOX advice on one of the simplest cases:\n \n What should a parent do if they learn their child may have homosexual inclinations?\n Parents can encourage their child not to define herself/himself primarily in terms of their sexual inclination or to participate in &#8220;gay subcultures,&#8221; which often tend to promote immoral lifestyles. Rather they should encourage their child to form friendships with the wider community. Young people in particular need special encouragement and guidance to seek out a confessor and spiritual director who will support their quest to live a chaste life. &#8220;Every effort should be made to ensure that adolescents have access to age-appropriate professional counseling services that respect Church teaching in matters of human sexuality (Ministry to Persons with a Homosexual Inclination: Guidelines for Pastoral Care, USCCB, 2006, p. 22-23).&#8221; \n\n http://pfox.org/Catholic_Parents_and_Kids_Talking_about_Homosexuality.html\n \n Not one iota of a hint about accepting the child, IF THE CHILD WISHES to remain gay.\n Instead, the dialogue starts IMMEDIATELY into how the parent can pressure the child to change.\n \n THAT is the part these people (and your follow-on dialogue) refuses to acknowledge.\n THIS is the reality of the situation.",

It's supporting them who make the decision to do so.

   "Jyoshu trying to pretend that my assessment of PFOX's position is based on only one thing (as he ignores OTHER comments helping to prove my point) is getting old.\n \n So I've decided to throw out even more proof of PFOX's tendency to over-reach from just \"supporting ex-gays\" to actively working against gays and/or actively seeking recruitment of ex-gays.\n \n I have already posted one Q&A from PFOX's web-site which shows that when a parent has a gay child, they tell the parent to take the steps to try and make the kid an \"ex-gay\".\n NO commentary in their \"answer\" which covers \"what if my kid doesn't want to be ex-gay\"... emoticon_mad\n \n So here is some more junk for Jyoshu to ignore...\n \n \n \nThe American Family Association has teamed up with PFOX to launch a boycott of all Pepsi products. They are upset over Pepsi's support for Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), which the AFA claims promotes \"intolerance of the ex-gay community.\"\n\n Box Turtle Bulletin PFOX\n \n I really want Jyoshu to take a hard look at this one, cause it flies in the face of a LOT of the \"logic\" he is trying to throw out there...\n What Jyoshu INACCURATELY accuses me of doing? That is EXACTLY what PFOX has done here... :xbanghead\n \n \n \nIn 2002, PFOX planned a rally before a Fairfax School Board meeting to protest a proposed amendment to add homosexuality (\"sexual orientation\") as a category to Fairfax County, Virginia Public Schools' nondiscrimination code.\n\n http://www.teachthefacts.org/2005/01/what-is-pfox-doing-in-my-childs.html\n \n I'm sorry, but does that have ANYTHING to do with just \"supporting ex-gays\"???\n \n \n \n\"Why are we allowing people to tell them, 'Try it -- you might like it?' Over 70 percent of young kids 13- to 24-years-old, men having sex with men, are now HIV-positive,\" Griggs notes.\n\n Dispatches from the Culture Wars: PFOX Lies About Teens with HIV\n \n Lying about gays and scare tactics obviously designed to try and coerce parents into making their kids ex-gay. That goes a LONG way past just supporting people who \"choose\" to be ex-gay.\n \n \n I could go on, but what's the point.\n I don't think Jyoshu will address THE BIG PICTURE here, and he'll continue to try to nitpick at the details in order to pretend PFOX is just about supporting people who \"choose\" to be ex-gay, instead of making themselves an established tool of the anti-gay movement.",
