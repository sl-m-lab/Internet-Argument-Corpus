   "This is a rant - be prepared. \n \n I've been looking for a forum to post this, and this is gonna be it. I have been fuming since the State of the Union address, and you all should be, too. It has nothing at all to do with <insert doom voice< Weapons of MASSSSSS Destruction<no more Doom voice<, oh no. It's about all of this XXXXXXXX Christian Family Planning Act.\n \n There are so many penalties for choosing to not get married in this country.\n \n There's the biological penalty of living a shorter life - though I don't know how, considering that you're spouse is likely to nag you to death.\n \n There's the social penalty of not having the right to certain insurance benefits - any insurance plan will charge you more for being at risk of developing psychological problems if you don't have children to drive you insane.\n \n There's always been the financial penalty of paying higher taxes, even when those taxes are going largely to pay for things like public schools and juvenile detention centers that your lack of children will never use.\n \n and now, with Bush's newly planned tax incentives for getting married and having children, we are just one step closer to the <i<Logan's Way</i< ideology that will someday lead to required marriages and birthrates.\n \n Maybe that's a bit far fetched - but I thought at one time that government intervention to encourage people to have children they cannot afford was far fetched, as well. \n \n So, now what? Am I to play this game and get married and have children that I have neither the desire nor the ability to support? Am I to pair off with some random person, settle for someone else when I'm not even ready to settle for myself? I think not!\n \n At my age, I should be dating casually - having casual friendships and casual sex; not working towards tieing myself to that one special someone who will eventually drag me down to a watery grave!\n \n I don't like an administration that so vehementally declares that they're fighting for freedom in the world, all the while at home asking its own citizens to play games with their own personal freedoms. So, who's with me? Who's ready to take a stand for your right to be single, to develop a stable life and a healthy sense of self before commiting to a life of manogamy and child rearing?",

Am I to play this game and get married and have children that I have neither the desire nor the ability to support?

So, who's with me? Who's ready to take a stand for your right to be single, to develop a stable life and a healthy sense of self before commiting to a life of manogamy and child rearing?\n\n \n Well, first of all, lets face it, children cost money. In light of that, I'm afraid that you have a repressive world view. Why do you want to deny the right of people who happen to have children to a decent standard of living? Why do you want them in bondage to their jobs just to get by, preventing them from spending time with their family? Why don't you support the right of women to freely choose to become mothers regardless of economic situation? \n \n Its an undeniable fact - people who have had parents at some point are far more likely to become parents. In short, its genetic. Progressive countries realize this, and accordingly they adjust for it. On what basis do you claim that people should be penalized for having children? The average child costs 100,000 dollars or more from birth to adulthood. The fact is, these people are hit hard with or without economic assistance. Not only that - around 50% of children are unplanned. The parents have not even made the choice to have a child, and you want them to suffer for that! And you complain about being penalized for your choice to remain single.\n \n Well, that was my rant. You can see that some of it is in jest - but please don't ignore it. Remember that there are two sides to every story. I can definately understand that sometimes it seems like your rights are being infringed upon, but look at it in a different way and maybe there's rights on both sides. Don't forget that you have recieved these benefits during your own childhood.\n \n The family is the most important part of society. (do you agree?) This is the one social group in history that cares deeply enough about growing, individual children to help them realize that they are worthwhile and valuable. As well, the most important people who determine the future of a nation are the mothers and fathers. What is more important to a society than the raising of healthy children?",

Why do you want them in bondage to their jobs just to get by, preventing them from spending time with their family? Why don't you support the right of women to freely choose to become mothers regardless of economic situation?  \n Yes, children do cost money. I'm not completely base; I totally understand that. However, it is not my responsibility to support those children. Take, for example, my step mother. I love her dearly, so this isn't a family fued thing - but she paid in areound 2-3K in taxes this year, and got almost 7k in return. How? I have no ****ing idea. My brother and his wife paid in less than that, and generally get back up to or exceeding 6k. They have two children and make little more than minimum wage. I don't think that someone with children should have a \"decent standard of living\" when it infringes upon my standard of living. Whether or not you expected to get a rise out of me with that Why don't you support the right of women to freely choose to become mothers regardless of economic situation? comment, you can't - because I don't support them. Not at all. I don't think anyone should have children that they cannot support without social aid, which is exactly what I see all these damn \"child tax credits\" as.\n \n Its an undeniable fact - people who have had parents at some point are far more likely to become parents. In short, its genetic. Progressive countries realize this, and accordingly they adjust for it. On what basis do you claim that people should be penalized for having children? The average child costs 100,000 dollars or more from birth to adulthood. The fact is, these people are hit hard with or without economic assistance. Not only that - around 50% of children are unplanned. The parents have not even made the choice to have a child, and you want them to suffer for that! And you complain about being penalized for your choice to remain single.\n \n Yes, my choice to remain single. Planned or unplanned, every pregnancy that is carried to term is a choice. That person chose not to use appropriate birth control measures, and then that person chose to proceed to have a child that would be difficult to support. End of story. I don't care how much it costs to raise someone else's child, because it is neither my business nor responsibility. Again, you seem to veiw this as something that I'm being vindictive about; I don't want these people to suffer, per sei - I just want them to be responsible for their responsibilities and leave me out of it.\n \n I can definately understand that sometimes it seems like your rights are being infringed upon, but look at it in a different way and maybe there's rights on both sides. Don't forget that you have recieved these benefits during your own childhood.\n \n Number one: any benefits I received as a child were paid for in my parent's taxes - that were reduced because we were low-income and I am one of three children. They got all of those tax credits, and I didn't support them then. My father still receives certain benefits becasue my sister in underage, but they are largely in the form of a Social Security check she gets - she is being paid from my mother's earned ss account until her 18th birthday, as she is dead. \n Number two: My oposition to this is that I am paying for a larger percentage of things like public schools, youth detention facilities, and youth services than my brother, who has two children, is. In my own childhood, I did not receive any of these services, so I have no debt to repay to these institutions. \n \n \n The family is the most important part of society. (do you agree?) This is the one social group in history that cares deeply enough about growing, individual children to help them realize that they are worthwhile and valuable. As well, the most important people who determine the future of a nation are the mothers and fathers. What is more important to a society than the raising of healthy children?\n \n I do agree with your first statement, but with an adendum - The financially stable family is the most important part of society. The family that is self-supporting, that has thought out and planned for their own security and future, is the most important societal entity. What is more important than raising healthy children? I don't know; maybe inspiring, through example, a strong sense of self-sufficience and independence? maybe encouraging our children to accept, alone, the consequences of their actions? \n \n I don't hate families - I just don't support social injustice.",

   "Josephine, \n \n I agree that getting married should not give tax benefits, this is unfair, but everyone else's kids will in twenty-some years be the society of that time, so it is in everyone's best interest that children are fully supported by society.\n \n I do think that considering global resource distribution the population increasing (in the US for example) is beyond taxing to the world's resources. Not to mention that most people are told and feel that having kids is simply a \"normal\" progression of their life (go to school, get married, have kids, retire, die- in that order). Because young and mid-aged adults live such seperate lives from children (and elders, for that matter) people mistake wanting to be around kids with wanting to be a parent with wanting to conceive their own child, when none of these are a necessary given.\n \n For example, there are hundreds of thousands of unwanted children in the US who are not adopted because they are not babies.\n \n Anyway, that's also a seperate issue from your right to live a happy \"single\" life. Unfortunately, our society is based on a \"coupling\" system, so it is much harder, emotionally and logistically (financially!) to be \"single\". Many people are just so sold on the married-with-children package that they can't even imagine a happy life that isn't like that- but that's their inadequacy, not yours.",

   "emoticon_xhoho I agree with you to the point. But, I have some issues that I'm kind of unsure about. For now, we single folks are taking care of these children in directly by paying taxes. But in the future some of these kids will grown up to be the one who may indirectly taking care of us. For example, some will grow up to be the farmers and produce foods for us.

   "I think that that one is to ensure that everyone gets an education. It would be pretty hard for many families to pay for that.\n\n \n \n Exactly, because investing in our children is the only way to ensure we have a future. \n \n Also, somebody was ranting up a few postings abot their stepmother paying in $3000 in taxes and getting back $7000. This is called the earned income tax credit. It is what we have instead of a higher minimum wage, thus ensureing that it is nearly impossible for your stepmother to improve her life on her own because the closer you get to makeing a decent wage, the less of an EITC you get, and the harder you work, the more you make. So, in the name of compassion towards the poor, we penalize the lower middle/upper lower class for working hard while at the same time removing any incentive for the poor to try to improve their lives by their own efforts. Socialism at its finest.\n \n Bottom line.....you have to have kids to continue your society. Middle class folks are having trouble making enough money to live a middle class lifestyle and raise their kids, so we give them a break. Single folks do kind of get screwed on the deal, but I would imagine the whining will stop just about the time they start collecting social security, which is being paid for by the kids whose futures we are investing in.\n \n \n \nBecause young and mid-aged adults live such seperate lives from children (and elders, for that matter) people mistake wanting to be around kids with wanting to be a parent with wanting to conceive their own child, when none of these are a necessary given.\n\n \n \n Obviosly single with no kids. Raising children is VERY rewarding. It is a big pain in the butt sometimes, but I wouldn't trade it for the world. The urge to propogate is a driving force throughout the animal kindom and cannot be expalined away so easily. I detest other peoples children, I have absolutly no desire to be around them. I have always detested other peoples children. I did want to have my own, and enjoy having my own, even though I still loathe other peoples little brats.\n \n We have children becuase it gaurantees that we outlive our bodies. I look at my daughter, and she looks like me, only with my wifes eyes, which oddly enough makes a very pretty little girl, since I believe I woudd be a god aweful ugly woman. I know that when I die, the values and morals that I teach her will live on, and she will pass them on to her children. Kind of makes you feel immortal.\n \n You don't have kids, when you die, that's it. Unless you perform some spectacularly increedible feats while you are alive, nothing lives on.

   "Okay - since I've been away from this one - here goes.\n \n Number one - I hardly see how this is comperable to having a college education. I have a college education, I worked for it, I supported myself in going to college, so I have a better paying job. This was a life-long committment; I had to start maintianing the grades to get there. My family was dirt poor, but I didn't recieve any governmental assisstance to attend; I recieved a meritious scholarship, something that I earned, and payed for the rest trhough working.\n \n Having a child is a life-long committment, as well. I never said it wasn't - but if it's going to be compared to the benefits of going to college, then they need to be leveled on the same playing field. So, if you want to fund your own child, then feel more than free to reap those oh-so-fulfilling benefits that you mentioned. I am not directly benefited by someone I do not know's decesion to have a child that they may or may not be able to afford, so stop asking me to pay the larger portion of the taxes to support them.\n \n I'm not saying that I don't hink I should be paying taxes to support schools; I just don't htink that I should be paying more towards the schools than someone who has 12 children attending them. You made that choice - you deal with it.\n \n If you're making a low enough wage to qualify for the EITC, perhaps you shouldn't have children. \n \n Josie",
