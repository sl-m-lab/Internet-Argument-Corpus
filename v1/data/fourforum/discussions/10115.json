   "Thanks daewoo.\n Does yours work well for you? What's the speed like?\n Is the card a one time payment, or are there monthly charges?\n\n \n I have used the cingular and the sprint. Both were not all that I expected them to be given the hype they get. while both are capable of higher speeds (in theory) my speed usually was around 60k, so slightly faster than dial up.\n \n It is better than nothing, but certainly not going to blow you away with the speed. They are good for email but not a lot else. I think I pay around $80 per month for cingulars unlimited data plan (whoever you go with, you want the unlimited plan...trust me). \n \n I also have a WiFi plan that has something like 17,000 hot spots nationwide...pretty much most McDonalds, starbucks, flying J's, etc... Most airports also have free wifi now, and most hotels have free high speed internet. Also, if you are in a tight spot and need high speed, you can pretty much drive into any residential area and find an open network pretty quickly. \n \n My parents live in Shawnee (past the harley dealer on shawnee mission parkway) and from their front porch I can hit 6 open networks. 4 of them are partially secure...you cannot just browse their home network...but on all of them you can access the internet. A lot of businesses do the same thing...either by accident or on purpose.",
