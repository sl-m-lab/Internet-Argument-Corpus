But really, it's not like she's the first 17 year old in the history of the world to get pregnant, and it's not like Clinton was the first guy on earth to cheat on his wife either.

   "I cant speculate on politicians outside of America, but for us, we need to look to the past to have a better tomorrow. Now I know that America is a lot different today than it was 200 years ago, its even a lot different than it was fifty years ago, and a lot of folks say what worked then will not work today, but I believe the principles will still work today. People today have somehow lost themselves, many people have the attitude that they only care about today, and as long as things are ok right now, then why worry about tomorrow. We have misplaced our morals, as we have misplaced our self respect and dignities. We started believing things are right, when in reality they are wrong. Weather you believe in God or not, you must still admit that before God was basically removed from schools and many homes, kids were a lot more behaved and respectful, and back then you could spank your child as a disciplinary action, and I dont mean beat your kids, there is a difference. I was spanked as a kid when I screwed up, but I was never beaten and I didnt develope a complex from it as some would have us to believe. All I am saying is that everyone, not just our politicians, needs to get back to doing what is right, instead of what is easy and socially acceptable, and our leaders need to do just that, lead, lead by example. I am what some refer to as a unconformist, I conform only to the law, but nothing else unless I believe it to be true and moral.",
