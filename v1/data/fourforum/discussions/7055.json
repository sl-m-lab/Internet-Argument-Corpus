   "The deadly H5N1 strain of the Wild Bird Flu virus is now in Turkey and this is due to Ukraine. People thinking this virus of Turkish origin are under strong illusion. Migrant birds heading for their habitual wintering in Turkey via Crimea brought it. With birds it's clear while with people it is not. I am still bursting with indignation. Why did Ukrainian authorities hide the fact of epidemic spreading in their territories, in the Crimea? They did it for months!! And so far nobody's made them account for this crime! Amid the present background with 70 or so H5N1 infected people dead in Asia it is a crime. The latest news is that this Bird Flu is rapidly spreading in Georgia in the Caucasus. What if Georgia officials will stick to the dangerous Ukrainian style on the matter? I mean keeping silence and inaction. \n All in all, I believe that relevant international bodies should denounce the Ukrainian practice as an evil and criminal one, so that nobody would dare to follow this bad example. As for Georgia sending there a team of independent experts is a must imo.",
