   "PARADOXES OF VELVET REVOLUTION IN GEORGIA \n \n Azerbaijan and Georgia are connected not only with common borders. They are attached to each other with deep historical contacts, soviet fate, similar collisions of transition period, ethnic conflicts and so on. Besides, both states are connected with \"oil ties\" and jointly increase strategic cooperation with the West. Recently their partnership was confirmed by friendly relationships of the presidents H.Aliyev and E. Shevardnadze. All above mentioned aspects of the partnership of Georgia and Azerbaijan create the background on which the picture of their close cooperation can be observed: notable events in one of the countries find reflection in the other country. \n Quite occasionally, in Azerbaijan H.Aliyev left the distance of the presidential elections and as a result of elections his son has become the president. In a month the parliamentary elections in Georgia caused \"velvet revolution\" with resignation of Shevardnadze. Almost at the same time Azerbaijan and Georgia lost friendly presidential tandem H.Aliyev-E. Shevardnadze and the countries entered the new line of development. \n Election of young presidents (Ilham Aliyev is 43 and Michael Saakshvili is 36 years old) brings every country to the \"zero cycle\" virtually charged with new expectations. This circumstance, no doubt, will affect not only the collisions of the political situation inside the country , but also the character of their relations. In the analytical reviews of TURAN we described in details the main moments of the election and post-election situation in Azerbaijan, possible scenarios of behavior of I.Aliyev in the role of the president and the expectations dominating in society. \n And today the other important question for us is to follow the dynamics of the political situation in Georgia and forecast of its perspectives. \n In November of 2003 Georgia struck us with \"velvet revolution\" , and it seemed that the \"Georgian volcano\" should calm and not make surprises. All were sure that M.Saakshvili would win the elections scheduled for January 4, 2004. However, he won with fantastic result - 97%, what is usual and is possible only in the soviet society. This \"small figure case\" shocked many people and gave ground for possible interpretation of motivations and consequences of \"velvet revolution\". \n Such result make us (enemies of Georgia and the opponents of M.Saakshvili) doubt fairness of elections and explain everything by usual procedure of falsification. As the \"velvet revolution\" was provoked just by that factor the opponents doubted that within a year the whole Georgian society has become democratic by 97%. Of course, the skeptics did not take into account the revolution euphoria which gave them ground to ignore the version of falsification. Nevertheless, most assess such situation as domination of \"total experience\" over democratic tendencies. \n For Azerbaijan truthfulness of any version of the processes taking place in Georgia is not mere interest. The character of relations of the two countries, and finally, the vector of possible innovations in Azerbaijan depend directly on the motivation of the \"velvet revolution\" of the choice of the Georgian society and the behavior of M.Saakshvili. From this point of view, any distancing of Georgia towards negative past is not good for Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is not interested in doubting positive results of the \"velvet revolution\". Nobody doubted the results of elections: M.Saakshvili was doomed to victory. But the Georgian society also was the hostage of the revolution euphoria which had to have total forms of expression. So , we cannot doubt fairness of elections in Georgia (and the phenomenon of democracy can be ignored , taking into account extraordinary revolution). Very important is the fact that according to the West, the motives and the collisions of the \"velvet revolution\" and of the elections in Georgia completely meet the norms of democracy. \n M.Saakshvili has received not only full trust of the West but also weighty vote of confidence of its people. It allows him to carry out real reforms as a result of which even the enemies of Georgia will not have any reason to reproach him. No doubt, that the democratic break in Georgia will be understood in Azerbaijan. Georgia and Azerbaijan are tied together with strong strategic ties and therefor they can progress only under coincidence of vectors of development: M.Saakshvili and H.Aliyev by joint efforts should bring partnership of their countries to new state which will create pre-conditions for forcing of reforms.",
