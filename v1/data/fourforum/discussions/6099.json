The first Matrix movie was good, but they went down hill from there, and again, being in a good movie doesn't make you a good actor anymore than being in a bad movie makes you a bad one. Keanu Reeves has the range of a pineapple. He's either playing a dumb-but-loveable idiot (Bill and Ted) or he's taking himself too seriously (everthing else). I like Bill & Ted and The Matrix as much as the next person (in fact, more so with the Bill & Teds), but I know a mediocre actor when I see one.\n \n You covered all movie genres? With the exception of Mike Myers, you pretty much only covered action flicks. I don't know why you are equating drama with chick flicks. First of all, most dramas aren't chick flicks. Secondly, not all chick flicks are dramas.",
