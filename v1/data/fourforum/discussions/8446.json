   "Should religions be defined and judged by their original intention or by their actual practice?\n \n So often in history and today, various groups claim that their extremist views are consistent with a particular religion when they are really utter distortions - militant extremist Islam and certain far right Christian groups come to mind. Part of the problem lies in the vagueness of many original religious texts which allow for diverse interpretations. However, my guess is that the main problem lies with people forming their views first based on tribal or group traditions or emotional reactions to current history, and then trying to fit their particular religion into their views - often only paying attention to those parts of the religious texts that suit their purposes.\n \n So, what are your views on this issue? Are religions defined by their original intent (to the degree that it can be determined) or by the actual practice? Also, is it the responsibility of the main-stream believers to try to reign in those that take extremist views in the name of their religion?",

If Christ existed, we have no way at all of knowing today whether he intended to found a church, or if he did what its precepts and practices would have been. All we have are purported quotes written down by people who hadn't met him long after he was dead.\n\n Given various writings about him soon after his death and the few independent historical sources mentioning him, I have little doubt that he existed. However, you are right that the main sources were written a considerable time after his death - when stories could have distorted or exaggerated with time. For example, the Gospel of John (the last, ~95AD) shows him as a more divine figure than does the Gospel of Mark (the earliest, ~60AD). Plus, there were a wide array of beliefs early on about Jesus - from beliefs that he was purely human (as we are) to beliefs that he was purely divine (where his human form was not real). However, even given the established orthodoxy that arose around the 4th century, and the subsequent fixing of the New Testament texts, my main point is that certain groups seem to pick and choose sections of the text to support their beliefs, while ignoring others. Islam also comes to mind where extremist militant Islamic groups pick only those sections of the Koran that support their extremist agenda, while the moderate muslims (whose beliefs might well match more closely to the majority of the Koran) stay relatively silent out of fear. What do you call Islam - that of the extremists or that of the moderates or both? Similarly, what do you call Christianity - that of, say, the Episcopalians, or that of the white supremasists or both?\n \nAs to the broader question, those of us who take a sociobiological view of religion will always regard its contemporary practice as definitive. Religions change with the socio-economic base of the society professing them, and they change in an adaptive way. What would have got you burned at the stake 500 years ago is orthodoxy now; they're very pragmatic beasts, religions.\n\n Religions do stray from their origins but if they stray far away from their founding texts, then at some point can't you say that they are no longer representing that religion? That is especially true when you speak of extremists groups that are distant from the norm - such as extremist militant Islam or white supremasist Christian groups.",

Taking the long view, Christianity is just an off-shoot of Judaism; and Judaism itself seems to have evolved from a mish-mash of Early Near Eastern religions, with the Yahweh/El figure emerging as a composite of Baal-like predecessors. This being the case, 'straying from their origins' is hardly an issue: their 'origins' lay in a departure from pre-existing socio-economic conditions; when those conditions change again, further change is hardly unexpected.",

Similarly, Buddhism started off as an offshoot of Hinduism. At some point, beliefs change enough from their origins that one can call those new beliefs a new religion. I admit that there is often no clear dividing line and such separations are often mired in politics as well. For example, a number of early Christian church leaders wanted to keep Christianity within the realm of Judaism - including St. Peter, if I am not mistaken. \n \n My main point is that religions are not and cannot be completely flexible. Also, a lot of these extremist offshoots are not rejecting the main text to show flexibility in the religion they claim to follow. They mainly still claim to honor those main text but they seem to only pay attention to them selectively while simply ignoring those parts that don't suit their purposes. So, their claim of following the original texts is simply false.",

I'd also quibble over what you call 'the main text', since it isn't usually a single clear-cut document: the judaeochristian bible is a case in point.",
