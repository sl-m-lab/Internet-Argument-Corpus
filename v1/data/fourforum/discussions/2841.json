   "FYI: POC = Person Of Color\n \n My answer to this question is \"no\".\n A POC can be prejudiced against a non-POC, but cannot be \"racist\".\n Racism = Power + Prejudice.\n A POC may HATE white people, but does not, generally speaking, have the power to systematically enforce that prejudice, to use it to marginalize and oppress white people. A POC does not have institutional racism behind him.\n \n This is why I strongly support Affirmative Action. Without it, a white employer (and most employers ARE white, like it or not... most people in any position of power or authority are white) will, nine times out of ten, hire a white applicant over a black one, even when all else is equal. Studies have shown that an applicant with a foreign or \"black-sounding\" name will be less likely to get called back for a job interview than an applicant with a more \"white-sounding\" name. So, Affirmative Action is necessary. It creates a mandatory minimum standard for the hiring of POCs. \n \n White people in America need to recognize their privilege. It is not comfortable to do so, but it is the first step in becoming an anti-racist and a better person. We need to identify the institutionalized racism all around us. So often, we are blind to injustice, when it is in our favor. Talk to a POC... ask him or her about it. Ask a POC about instances where he or she felt discriminated against because of the color of his/ her skin. \n \n We must recognize racism for what it truly is, before we can deconstruct it.\n \n Just my 2 cents, ~ Ivy",

Racism describes an attitude. Discrimination is racism in action. I think it's overly simplistic to suggest that whites have all the power and POCs don't. There are certainly situations where the reverse is true. \n \n As to affirmative action, a term that can mean different things to different people, I have to say it depends. I would support outreach but not qoutas. I would support removing discriminatory impediments that unfairly exclude POCs but I don't support preferential treatment.

I'm touched by the love and concern they have for their fellow POC, that they want to see ALL of them \"make it\", but that hardly justifies the snot-flowing cries of racism",
