   "Well a lot of people are assuming Bush will be re-elected in 2004. He has a lot going for him including that the people of America relate well to him in that he is just a common Joe and he was with us through the terrorist attacks of 9/11. However, the economy is sagging, joblessness is very high, and government spending is out of control which is very strange for a conservative president. The question I pose is how many people here are planning on voting Bush in 2004 and what are your reasons for making the decisions you made? Or if you haven't decided yet, discuss what your still waiting to see before you make your decision.",

A lot of people were putting their money on the idea that recovery would occur in 2000 and 2001 and they were wrong. The direction of the economy is hard to predict, but it is starting to look better. It will still take time and there will be bumps in the road. Hopefully it will recover within 8 months but I don't think we can just assume that it will. A single terrorist attack can completely ruin this and many other international issues can do the same.\n \n Edit: The economy probably is the top issue that Bush has going against him right now. He has to find a way to turn this around or he is going to be in serious trouble. Also he will have to find WMDs in Iraq or at least explain what went wrong here and he has to hope they find Saddam or even Bin Laden for a boost in ratings and image.",

I've been a big supporter of his since 9/11 even though I voted Gore in the last election which back then I was politically ignorant anyways, or at least that is how I'd like to explain my voting for Gore. Bush has a laundry list of things that I don't like about him including his border policy, his rampant government spending to buy votes, his shyness towards a camera in his VERY few public statements he has made so for, his projection of being poorly educated (although he is well educated), the laws getting through that allow government to invade our privacy, and his warmongering tendancies.\n \n Bush isn't the greatest president the US has ever seen although he has had probably the toughest term in office since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

   "Interesting Factoid on Dean: He's one of the more moderate democrats in the race. You wouldn't know it due to the media coverage, but its true. Dean got labeled as an uber-liberal based on his opposition to the Iraq war. But as Governor of Vermont, he was a noted Budget Hawk and got an \"A\" rating from (that favorite democratic organization) the NRA. On the issues the American's view him on, he is on the left. But as a whole, he is pretty centrist.\n \n AMD: I hardly think Bush has done an admirable job on either the terrorism issue OR the economy. An EXCELLENT article to read on the former issue (more Homeland Security than terrorism but still) is \"The 9/10 President\" Published by the New Republic in March of 2003. If you can't find that, I made a big post on Bush's failures regarding HS in the politics section, look there. Basically, Bush's legacy RE: terrorism is not finding Bin Laden, taking away resources from the search for Bin Laden to settle an old score with a regime which posed no threat to the US (even if it had WMD's, it had no way of delivering them to the US) and probably poses MORE of threat to US security now that it is deposed than it did while in office (Because if Hussein HAD WMD's , then he probably gave them away to prevent them from being found. A likely recipiant? Al-Qaeda), and drained foreign support from an endeavor that could have been used to rid the world of the scourge of terror altogether. Today, we have no idea where Bin Laden is, have made no inroads in securing Afghanistan, and incidentally have been dramatically unfunding Homeland Security (Bush and congressional republicans have repeatedly shot down democratic efforts to increase spending on that front).\n Regarding the economy, Bush has been nothing short of abysmal. I am not one of those people who blames Bush 100% for the current ills. The economy moves in cycles, and we were due for a drop. But Bush has exacerbated the current problems. The Tax Cut of 2001 took a surplus that we could have used to steel ourself against the coming downturn and squandered it (Before you scream \"9/11\" or \"Enron\", keep in mind that the CBO was projecting a deficit before either event occured, thanks to the tax cut). Bush has passed 3 tax cuts since he entered office, the 2001 cut which started the mess, a 2002 \"economic stimulus\" cut which stimulated the economy so much that nobody remembers it, and the infamous 2003 dividend cut, which is a textbook example of how to NOT cut taxes to stimulate the economy. We have a record deficit, and while the economy is recovering with respect to the classic indicators, unemployment is still hovering around 6%. Since the Bush tax cuts have been aimed at freeing up more capital for employers, not aimed at workers and consumer spending, the companies have been spending the money to ramp up productivity, so they can expand w/out hiring new workers. The recovery is NOT resulting in more jobs for American's, in fact, unemployment is still quite close to record highs for the past decade.\n \n Bush, unfortuantely, is a slave to one dogma: Tax cuts for the wealthy. He has produced dubious figures to support them. He has neglected Homeland Security and other desperately needed programs to pay for them. And he has tanked the economy in a desperate attempt to remain faithful to them. It is time for some fresh ideas. Its time for a new president.",

A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, and the economy hasn't had that in quite some time. We are at the time when employment should be kicking back up, but it isn't.\n \n The reason the rich get the most back in taxes is because they pay the most in taxes. The reason they pay the most in taxes is because they (by far) make the most money. They pay 37% of taxes, but also make around 30% of the total income. The inequities balance out. It certainly is POSSIBLE to cut the tax burden on the middle class, it would just be a vastly smaller tax cut as a whole (b/c, as was said before, they pay little in taxes). But IF it is impossible to do that, as you suggest, then to me that offers more of a condemnation of Bush's policies than a defense. Since influxes of cash have a higher multiplier effect when given to the poor as to the rich (Law of Diminishing Returns), if Bush's policies are THAT ineffective at targeting the lower classes in society, then it is clear that we should have targeted the cuts elsewhere (or done some other program that WOULD have stimulated the lower tiers, might I reccommend the EITC?).",

It took me till I was 20 before I even began to realize that the Democrats never really did accomplish anything except give away our country to the Mexicans and fight to steal as much as they could from the rich so the lazy could live in luxury and attempt to discouraged individualism.\n \n Well I hope that the Republicans do gain seats in the next election and I also hope Bush is re-elected in that case. However I do fear one of two things will come out of that. Either he will do a Clinton and really let himself go in his last 4 years since he doesn't have a hope of getting re-elected again anyways or he will come out swinging and do what he knows needs to be done regardless of whether it is popular amongst the left-wingers since he still wouldn't need to worry about getting re-elected again. I think Bush has been holding back on some of his better and more productive ideas because they could blow up in his face come election time. With four years of free reign and no need to worry about re-election, I think Bush and crew will come out and surprise everyone and really make a difference with our nation. At least that is what I am hoping for and I think this is a much safer bet than assuming one of the Democrats lined up to run for election will do something great.",

These are not the people that get the most done here, I can garentee that. They do work long hours but they do very little in that time compared to some of the more skilled Americans. So needless to say right off the bat I knew your statements were incorrect. Most Mexicans are inefficient because they are less educated and/or skilled than born Americans, they know far less English which doesn't help them a bit, and they seem to come from a far less demanding society.\n \n So the middle ground in our debate is that Mexicans CAN work harder than Americans although they are OFTEN less educated and skilled. Americans have a different way of working. We have been educated to get things done efficiently and our capitalist system in place helps a great deal as well. But one thing I'll still debate with you is that if all Mexicans were to work twice as hard as any American, they would overcome their third world status simply because they could export products like crazy and at low prices since they would have such an excess amount of whatever they wished to make.",

They have to accept less money to work so they can both get a job and hope that the employer won't turn them in. Then they have to work hard to keep their job and perhaps work 80 hour weeks to get money.\n \n I haven't seen any statistic to back this up but it is my guess that they work hard in the US in short bursts before either getting sent back to Mexico or going back on their own.\n \n However, you do see Americans who are working their way up the ladder work very long hours and take on very complex work for more hours per day than they even get paid for. Given a certain reason to work hard, both Mexicans and Americans will do so. Americans do it to get power and improve their life while Mexicans do it to get what is a lot of money to them and please their employer enough so they don't turn them in.\n \n Still I don't think either one can carry on like this for years and years.",

For instance, lets say an illegal takes a job in California. The money he is paid is now taken away from a legal American meaning they are losing money that they could be using to support/feed/clothe their family. Then that money is also likely to get sent back home to Mexico to help feed his family instead of in our market. So now other local businesses are also beginning to feel the affects of this illegal working here because less money is being spent by Americans who would generally be shopping there and is instead going to Mexico. Then of course tax dollars will drop affecting our government. Also the distinct possibility of him being caught and sent through our legal system and more money being spent by our government to get him out only so he can cross back over again and we go through the whole cycle again. In the end this leaves the government with less money, the American people with less money and jobs, and businesses with less revenues. Multiply this by all the Mexicans who want to sneak over the border.\n \n Now does it make any sense at all that we allow illegals to do this? I know it may make you FEEL good and of our Democrats are all about emotions guiding their decisions so it is no wonder why you would like this sort of system even if it would bankrupt America if done to a great enough level. It is a system that simply doesn't work.\n \n Now if you want to on an individual level or even a government level send aid to Mexico then that is fine. Help them rebuild or help feed a child or family. That is great! But allowing illegals in is like taking money, jobs, and business away from the communities and how is that ethical?

   "You also have to realize that the money going towards the illegal is coming from somewheres and it is going somewhere as well. For instance, lets say an illegal takes a job in California. The money he is paid is now taken away from a legal American meaning they are losing money that they could be using to support/feed/clothe their family. Then that money is also likely to get sent back home to Mexico to help feed his family instead of in our market. \n \n Now does it make any sense at all that we allow illegals to do this? I know it may make you FEEL good and of our Democrats are all about emotions guiding their decisions so it is no wonder why you would like this sort of system even if it would bankrupt America if done to a great enough level. It is a system that simply doesn't work.\n \n\n \n First off, (and fgs I hope for the last time), immigration does not cost the US money, it funds an entire and important sector of the US economy.\n \n The people who enter the US \"illegally\" aren't taking away jobs from anyone, they take jobs that US-born americans would refuse. Who would staff the sweatshops in LA, who would clean up after the rich, who would wash dishes or clean toilets if it weren't for the \"illegal\" underclass?\n \n Guaranteed, if the US gov't actually stopped \"illegal\" immigration tomorrow, the US economy would grind to a halt. \n \n You talk about \"democrats\" letting emotions guide decisions, but I don't see you coming up with any facts or logic to back up your arguments.",

   "No I care for them on an equal level. The welfare of an American is just as important to me as the welfare of a Mexican, or any race/nationality.\n \n But some people (i'm by no means saying that you are like this) care about Americans more than anyone else, as if we are some superior culture or something. We're all equal. It shouldnt matter what nationality you are.\n \n Some people say \"God Bless America\", I say \"God Bless Everyone... not just America\"\n\n \n As people, Americans are not superior.

The same goes for our government which should be worried more about Americans than any other country in the world. It is their job to serve Americans.\n \n So when it comes to the topic of illegals, we are talking law and government in my view and in this case I will push for the good of Americans over the good of the illegals. I don't want to see the US degrade to the level of Mexico someday so it is in both our interests to try and prevent that from happening and allowing a flow of illegals over isn't going to help our cause.",

I broadly spoke of education as far as it pertains to life in America as I'm sure your aware. We speak English, they speak Mexican (Spanish) for example. The \"hot\" country idea I don't hold as fact but it is pretty common to see the colder countries being more successful as long as the cold isn't too extreme. I don't really understand why you would wonder about this.\n \n So saying Americans are better educated is insane when comparing us to Mexicans? Our educational system may not be the best on the planet but I doubt you will find many Mexicans working in Silicon Valley either. Countries from all over the world have educational systems better than ours and similar to ours and can have people travel here and fit in perfectly. I'm not saying we're above everyone or that no Mexican can be considered educated.\n \n That Nazi link is weak though. Linking anyone to Nazism is linking them to WWII and the holocaust. Linking someone to being related to a Nazi doesn't mean anything. I bet somewhere in my bloodline I'm related to a Nazi and I maybe even am better off today financially because of it. But I doubt that would make someone think 'Nazi' when they think of me. BTW, when you actually form an opinion on our president that makes some sense, please go ahead and share it with us.\n \n Uggh, I also never said immigration is costing us money. I've been focusing on the illegals.\n \n Your broadly claiming that no illegal is taking a job away from any American? I seriously doubt that especially in our current economic situation. Also consider that they are able to recieve welfare and unemployment in some cases and that takes money from individual Americans and essentially goes into the hands of a person who is breaking our laws. To answer your questions, teenagers or someone just looking to get by for a while, butlers I believe come from all different walks of life, and janitors are also from all different walks of life. In Michigan there are white people doing janitorial work so if it is true that only illegals are doing this in LA as you have stated then you have proven my point.\n \n Your garentee may strangely hold some water. We have let ourselves get too deep in allowing illegals in for too long and some places depend on them now. This process couldn't be completed overnight obviously. However our economy would benefit from there being less illegals. Less legal proceedings, less crime, less legal citizens without jobs and therefore less welfare, less unemployment, more tax dollars, and more money staying in the US instead of going to Mexico.\n \n Do you deny that Democrats base decisions on emotions? I don't deny that Republicans are capable of doing this same and often do, but not to the extent that I've seen Democrats do the same. The debate of illegals is no different. A non-emotional arguement would not look at why we should feel bad for the illegals and their families and would focus more on economic and governmental issues. If you don't focus on feeling bad for the illegals, how can you even debate that they have no right to be here? It is against the law, they hurt our economy, they cause crime, and the costs only mount when they are sent into our legal system.",

   "All those test score comparisons do is test how well people do at tests.\n \n To say that because someone did not go through the US education system makes then less skilled at jobs is what I consider the insane statement.

I don't really understand why you would wonder about this.\n\n \n I can't believe you are reducing world history and international economics to a question of temperature. \"Colder\" countries are not \"more successful\" unless you define success as \"like America\". There are so many factors that have shaped the present system of international dominance by \"first-world\" nations. Whether or not it's cold outside is really not one of them.\n \n \nIf your an illegal immigrant from a corruput society with an inefficient government then you bring those ideas and notions with you and they stay with you. Illegal immigration is turning our country into an image of thier country. Look around you of all the countries, the USA is not perfect, but is has got it's government and society together compared with the rest of the world.\n\n \n The US is no less corrupt than anywhere else, neither has it got itself \"together\" more than other nation-states. It just has bigger guns. No universal medical care, a deplorable educational system, corrupt gov't and self-serving international politics define the US more than any kind of superiority.\n \n Look, I didn't grow up in a \"Third World\" country, so I'm hardly an expert. But I did do a specialisation degree in \"Third World\" History and Economics at college, and I can guarantee you the situations in the countries you are speaking of are far more complex than \"inefficient governments and corrupt societies\". People have their reasons for fleeing their countries of origin, and believe me, they would not choose the US over their homes if they had much of a chance of survival at home. Besides which, the US gov't doesn't really have a leg to stand on in terms of international law when it comes to trying to legislate who can come here and who can't. Despite what CNN might say. \n \n \nLinking someone to being related to a Nazi doesn't mean anything. I bet somewhere in my bloodline I'm related to a Nazi and I maybe even am better off today financially because of it.\n\n You obviously misunderstood. He is not related to a Nazi (unless you are saying his grandfather was ideologically as well as financially driven to do business with them). His fortune is based largely on several liasons to Nazis, Bin Laden Sr., and other nefarious dealings. If you follow the link on my original post you will find more information. \n \n Furthermore, I think it should matter to you if you have benefitted from the Nazis. I don't think many Jewish people would disagree. That's dirty money of the worst kind, and using it is complicity, pure and simple. People who profit from other people's murder, torture, starvation, forced labour, etc., are complicit. \n \n Besides which, it was illegal, under the \"Trading with the Enemy\" Act.\n \n \nBTW, when you actually form an opinion on our president that makes some sense, please go ahead and share it with us.\n\n \n Well, geez, where to begin?\n \n He avoided fighting in the Vietnam war by joining the National Guard.\n \nThe Washington Post reports that Bush joined the National Guard 12 days before his student deferment would have expired, and that in spite of his low score on the pilot's aptitude test (25, the lowest score allowed), and in spite of the waiting list that some kids spent years on, Bush was sworn in as an airman the day he applied. Indeed, so giddy was Bush's commander, Col. Walter B. \"Buck\" Staudt, that he later staged a special ceremony so he could have his picture taken giving Bush the oath, instead of the captain who actually had sworn Bush in. Bush spent two years learning to fly airplanes in his home state of Texas. \n \n As the 2000 Presidential campaign moved along, angry veterans in Alabama claimed that George W Bush never performed any military service in that state, as stated on his campaign website. They offered a reward of $1000 (which rose to $3,500) to anyone who could prove that he had. No one came forth with any proof. \n Eight days before the election, the Boston Globe reported discrepancies between the Bush campaign's statements regarding his military service and what records and documents showed. In 1972, the Globe reported, Bush moved from Houston to Mobile, Alabama to work on a Senate campaign. It was at this time, the Globe found, that he was suspended from flight duty for not taking his annual flight physical. Furthermore, the Globe could find no evidence that he ever performed any drills while in Alabama, or any more drills after returning to Houston. \n\n \n Then there is his death tally, wherein he authorizes executions on numerous tenuous cases, including an eighty-year old grandma who killed her chronically abusive husband, and a kid (juvenile at the time of his conviction) who was convicted based on a single eye-witness who claimes to have identified him from 30 ft away through her car window in the dark while driving by.\n \n Of course, he did pardon and save from the death penalty one man, a serial killer who tortured, cannibalized and inflicted all possible atrocities on his victims (of which he has confessed to some 600). Henry Lee Lucas is a great case for a devil's advocate defense of the death penalty, which he never actually faced. \n \n This is the man who is the Commander-In-Chief of your military arsenal. And these are only a few examples of his insane behaviour. Not to say that Gore is much better, I'm just talking about the current President. Who says he's \"fighting a war on terror\".

And politicians know nothing or very very little about the whole education process, and they are the ones who make the rules... go figure. But some politicians do have better stances on education than others.\n \n Like I said, Bush has refused to give the federal funds that he promised to the states. Many states are virtually bankrupt and have no room in the budget to fund education adequately. \n \n I like John Kerry's stance on education, while he does support NCLB (which i dont agree with) he also wants to actually give the states what was promised to them. While the Bush administration sought to cut funding for school reform and issued restrictive guidelines, Kerry has promised to give the states more flexibility to meet the goals and standards set by the government. And most importantly, Kerry is opposed to school vouchers.\n \n I like Howard Dean's position too. He's pretty much opposed to Bush's education \"reform\" and believes it should be up to the states to test and determine which schools are \"failures\". The Bush administration also tends to put much of the blame on the teachers and ignores the other factors. Howard Dean has said that the most important predictor of how a child performs in school is the parents. Bush and his under-qualified secretary of education place the blame solely on teachers, which is unfair. They expect a school located in a bad neighborhood to perform at the same level as a school in a suburban rich white neighborhood. Well it aint gonna happen, and guess what, its not the teachers fault. Its the environment and home that the children have grown up in. Parents are responsible for that, not teachers.\n \n Those are the two Democrat canidates that I really having been paying alot of attention to, so I'm not as aware of Lieberman's and Gephardt's position on education.

In my opinion, the main problem is discipline and what's going on at home.\n\n \n This is such an oft-repeated phrase that it's meaningless.\n \n How can the problem with schools be \"discipline\"? Do you mean a lack of discipline, or a problem with the kind of discipline used? (I'm assuming that you aren't meaning that discipline itself is a problem...) All the \"discipline\" in the world make a library or chemistry set appear.\n \n What's going on at home? Oh, you mean the fact that kids are going to school having not eaten because of cuts to social programs? Yeah, that sure as hell is bad for schools...\n \n But neither the parents, the kids, the teachers or administrators are responsible for the overcrowded classrooms and lack of textbooks and supplies. That's not even mentioning what's written in the textbooks, or the stinky curriculum itself...\n \n Sounds like just a distraction tactic. \n \n To quote Chris Rock \"If your school's got old-XXX books, and brand-new metal detectors, let me hear you say 'That ain't right!'\" (from Head of State- Rock is a genius...)",

   "Since this thread has fallen into being Bush's policy on Education here is an article posted on CNN today.\n \n Bush touts his education plan\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/09/06/bush.radio.ap/index.html\n \n \n\n WASHINGTON (AP) -- With millions of children back in class, President Bush is trying to showcase his administration's achievements in education, shifting gears after emphasizing the economy. \n \n The rotating messages are part of a larger bid to keep the public focused on his domestic agenda, even as news from postwar Iraq eclipses most everything else. \n \n In his weekly radio address Saturday, Bush talked about a sweeping education bill that he signed into law 20 months ago. \n \n \"This month, as students across the nation are starting a new school year, parents, teachers and principals are starting to notice a difference in America's schools,\" he said. \n \n \"The No Child Left Behind Act that I signed into law last year is raising standards for student achievement, giving parents more information and more choices, requiring more accountability from schools, and funding education at record levels.\" \n \n All 50 states and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico submitted compliance plans that were approved by the Department of Education, the president said. \n \n \"While we're demanding excellence from schools, we're also giving them extra resources to succeed,\" he said. Forty states have received nearly $1.3 billion for reading in kindergarten through third grade, he said. \n \n Bush said his proposed budget for next year boosts education funding to $53.1 billion, an increase of nearly $11 billion since he took office. \n \n Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, who formed an unlikely alliance with Bush to assure passage of the law, said $53.1 billion would be an insignificant $26 million increase over last year. \n \n A Senate Republican education bill under consideration would cut funding drastically for the new programs, Kennedy said. \n \n Kennedy has become one of Bush's fiercest critics on education. \n \n \"The hypocrisy is breathtaking, and the country shouldn't be fooled by it,\" Kennedy said. \"For the millions of children the president's budget on school reform leaves behind, he is actually practicing 'the soft bigotry of low expectations' that he always condemns.\" \n \n Bush, under Democratic fire for his handling of the economy, told employees of a freight-distribution company in Indianapolis on Friday that lagging employment figures in an otherwise improving picture was temporary. \n \n \"We've got a short-term problem,\" he said, but the long-term prognosis for more jobs was good under his tax cut and other economic stimulus proposals. \n \n He blamed some of the job losses on the increased productivity of American workers, and said jobs were often among the last things to rebound in an economic downturn.\n \n",

   "I think Bush's speech last night will work to his benefit as long as he is able to follow through with it. The additional cost of $87 billion is quite substantial but it is no more than what I expected. He also mentioned that he would try to get some of these funds from other nations. I'm not sure that many of them will be willing to provide help but it would be nice to see it happen.\n \n I wish he would have set a date to be out of Iraq and I wish he would have committed more troops to Iraq to help the efforts along. I was glad to see that he didn't speak to highly of the UN or France or Germany in his speech and I'm glad to see that he is still committed to the fight in Iraq and isn't planning on just pulling out like some people want to see happen. It is going to take time and it is going to be difficult especially while dealing with terrorist threats in Iraq. I was also glad to see Afghanistan mentioned. It seemed like that is becoming a forgotten war already and that country is still a mess. I believe Bush also mentioned that al Queda has returned to that country.\n \n I hope to see a free and democratic Iraq as soon as possible and it would be a nice boost to both American opinion and Iraqi opinion if there was a set date for us to leave Iraq. Of course it would also be a huge boost for Bush if he was to succeed in Iraq before the next election so lets hope he plans on getting an Iraqi government in place soon! I have renewed faith in Bush but I'll be watching closely to see what happens next in Iraq.",

But if you're looking for sexism, try your backyard first.\n\n \n You're still comparing two totally different situations. When a person in the US is raped or killed, an investigation begins. Sure, sometimes the investigation doesn't yield enough evidence for a conviction, but there is a justice system that will prosecute when there is. In the countries I mentioned, it was perfectly acceptable for that to take place.\n \n \nThere's enough horrible daily atrocities around to occupy your woman-loving self for a long time.\n\n \n Woman-loving self? How do you know I'm not gay?\n \n \nSuffering from amnesia? I said that Bush's family are at least as messed up as Hussein's, and you asked me to give examples.... \n\n \n So you put that on the same level as rape and murder?\n \n \nJeez, I dunno.... I just thought you might be disturbed by a president who gained his wealth through dealing with Nazis, cronies who dig up graves together, and theft of all kinds. Apparently you think this makes a good presidential candidate. God bless America.\n\n \n That would be his family, not him.",

How do you know I'm not gay?\n\n \n I meant in terms of your apparent concern for our \"welfare\".\n \n \nSo you put that on the same level as rape and murder?\n\n \n Bush's family and friends have been accused of rape and murder, actually. As I said as well, Bush kills people indiscriminately using his power to execute.\n \n \nThat would be his family, not him.\n\n \n No, him as well. But anyway, even if it were just his family, you think it's ok to use money that was raised by theft, extortion, liasons with torturers and genocidal lunatics, murder, etc., for one's own benefit, no matter how far away from the events you are (which in Bush's case is debatable)? \n \n I would call that at the very least an ethical dilemma. If my family's wealth (if they had any) came about like that, in other words, blood money, I would just get a job at the Dairy Queen or something. I don't think I'm particularly moral as a person, I think that's just regular.\n \n I sure as hell wouldn't float through life on my family's wealth and power, going as far as to run for the Presidency on that basis. I just don't believe it makes you a good person. I guess if you're American, it's ok, as long as you're not from Iraq?",

   "When a person in the US is raped or killed, an investigation begins.\n\n \n It is patently false that Iraq does not investigate rape and murder. It is also false to say that either the US or Iraqi police investigates all crimes without corruption and prejudice.\n \n \nWho sentenced the person who was put to death? What courts did it go through? Bush did not put anyone to death.\n\n \n \n Part of a governor's job is to review capital cases. The Governor must sign the death warrant for the person to be killed. The idea is that he is supposed to review the case to decide whether the death penalty is really called for (some charges having the death penalty automatically attached), and if the case needs to be reviewed in general. And there were a very high number of deaths during his mandate.\n \n \"George W. Bush's capital punishment record doesn't pass the sniff test, according to a Chicago Tribune investigation. Part 1 of the two-article series reports that of the 131 people executed on Bush's watch, an alarming number went to their deaths on shaky evidence and with inadequate counsel. \n \n Here are the numbers: In 43 cases, the defense attorney had been publicly sanctioned for misconduct before or after his or her work on the capital case; in 40 cases, the defense attorney presented a single witness or no witness at all during the penalty phase of trial; in 29 cases, a psychiatrist provided testimony that the American Psychiatric Association considers unethical or unreliable; in 23 cases, prosecutors relied on the testimony of jailhouse snitches; and in 23 cases, the state used scientifically sketchy visual hair analysis. \n \n \n Even after serious misconduct or mistakes are discovered, Texas courts often let convictions stand, the Chicago Tribune reports in Part 2 of the series. In one such case, the court declined to grant Cesar Fierro a new trial even though he had confessed to a murder only after police in Mexico took his parents hostage and threatened to torture them. He remains on death row.\"",

I actually think that the legal system is too flawed for capital punishment to be used effectively. I disagreed with your stating that Bush put people to death.

The governor does not actually have power to grant clemency, but s/he does have the power to grant a month-long stay of execution. In other states, the governor can simply not assign an execution date if they disagree with the sentence, but this is not possible in Texas, because the dates are court-assigned.\n \n Be that as it may, if killing people is indeed murder, and ordering someone's death is murder, that makes Bush a murderer.
