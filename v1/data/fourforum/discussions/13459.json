   "Liberal Fundamentalism \n \n Someone once said to beware of zealots. Yet Jesus Christ was a zealot for the ways of God, and Mother Theresa was certainly a zealot for helping the sick and needy. Being a zealot, then, is not automatically a prescription for hated. Likewise, religious fundamentalism. One can certainly believe in the fundamental teachings of Jesus Christ and Biblical values, practice them, and not be a threat to society or one's neighbors. On the other hand, there's a new and particularly pernicious brand of fundamentalism making the rounds in America today - liberal fundamentalism. \n \n Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines that seeks to elevate the ways and \"wisdom\" of man above the wisdom and desires of God. Its principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are revisited through suspect liberal \"scholarship\" or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of today's liberal elitists. \n \n The genesis of today's liberal fundamentalists was the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and \"free-love,\" illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and they enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt. \n \n Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice are often foreign concepts to them. \"Right and wrong,\" and \"good and evil\" were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than if it \"feels good, let's do it.\" The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their \"progressive\" mindset was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values. They said not to trust anyone \"over 30,\" and now they're over 30 and say, \"Trust us, and what we teach!\" Thank you, FOXNews.com - University of Colorado Board Votes to Fire Embattled Professor Ward Churchill - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News Ward Churchill. \n \n One of the most revered mantras of liberal fundamentalism is \"equality.\" The net effect of this experiment, in many instances, was to elevate women via the degradation of men, promote racial equality by instituting race-based preferences and reverse discrimination, engender class warfare against people of means via their socialistic redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other people's money, rather than relying on one's own personal initiative and work ethic), and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, pornography, and other ungodly issues) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal \"tolerance.\" However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a contradictory, partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. \n \n Rather than truly embrace \"freedom,\" liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses that are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership (Hello, Pelosi, Obama, & Reid). They seek to outlaw SUV's, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools and the workplace, embrace a de-facto litmus test against pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, try to squelch legitimate religious speech via \"hate-speech\" laws (note Canada), and generally engage in a wide range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values. \n \n Ii is certainly arguable, then, that \"progressive\" liberal fundamentalism substantially undermines the basic effectiveness of the government and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence. - Author Unknown",

   "Both good counterpoints.....I'm gonna vote on this one.\n \n \n \nIf a conservative doesn't like guns...\n If a liberal doesn't like guns...\n\n \n Easy wins. It's called Brady Campaign, VPC, Bloomberg etc. BANNING GUNS. Jo might say \"It's called NRA\" etc. Nope. The NRA is about PROTECTING rights, not forcing all to have a gun. Defence wins. Easy does it. \n \n \nIf a conservative is a vegetarian.....\n If a liberal is a vegetarian....\n\n \n This is a draw. We see both campaigns for eating less meat for numerous reasons, and \"Beef. It's what's for dinner!\" ads. Both sides are actively \"forcing\" their perspective. Both are right...or wrong. It's a personal choice. All of us have heard someone whine about the need for us to alter our lifestyles \"for your health\" or \"to save the poor cows\" or \"to save the environment\". Yet, we all know the propensity for meat lovers to try and sneak some hamburger past a vegetarian and say, \"HA! You just ate meat! You're not dead yet?\"\n \n \nIf a conservative sees a foreign threat of war to the USA... \n A liberal wonders how to surrender gracefully.......\n\n \n Jo wins this one, even though his/her limp wristed response to Easy appears to confirm exactly what Easy says. Liberals are not \"anti-defense\". They are merely \"anti-preemptive\". Conservatives see a threat....well?......destroy the threat. Liberals see a threat..well?......maybe it's just a mere threat. Both sides have merits. It's good to prevent threats from becoming reality. It's also good to make sure that a threat actually exists before resorting to \"scorched earth\". Both have their drawbacks. Waiting to comfirm a threat might end up in complete obliteration if it is, indeed, more than a mere threat. Preemptive strikes will not endear us to the rest of the world, and make us seem like heavy handed brutes. If the choice is being a living brute, or a well liked corpse, I know what I will choose every time. But the point/counterpoint was about defense. Liberals are not anti-defense. Jo wins.\n \n \nIf a conservative is homosexual...... \n If a liberal is homosexual......\n\n \n Jo wins again. Homosexuality and how one deals with it is a personal choice. Why shouldn't gays be accepted? I thought Christianity was all about acceptance, right? Yes, both sides \"force\" their world view. But, once again, we get to \"BANS\". Why should gay rights be \"banned\"? Gays are merely seeking freedom. Christians are tring to repress this by imposing their world view. Wanna be a good Christian? Be one. Forcing someone else into your version of morality doesn't seem very Christlike. Treat others how you would like to be treated. \n \n \nIf a black man or Hispanic are conservative..... \n Their liberal counterparts......\n\n \n Easy wins this one. Don't see too many minority conservatives in line asking for handouts. Don't see too many minority liberal CEO's advocating self-sufficient hard work.\n \n \nIf a conservative is down-and-out, he thinks about..... \n A liberal wonders...... \n\n \n Easy again. Welfare lines for liberals, job searches for conservatives. Not to say liberals don't work. But the idea of a support mechanism is entirely liberal based. Why should those who apply themselves and work hard have to provide a support mechanism (welfare) for those who choose not to? Where's the incentive to work, when I can just stay home and get the same benefits provided for me by someone who does? Both me, and liberal friends of mine have been out of work before. I GO LOOK FOR A JOB. They report to me how many more weeks of unemployment they have before they do the same. AAAAGH! \n \n \nIf a conservative doesn't like a talk show host..... \n Liberals demand..........\n\n \n Easyrider gets this one hands down. There's no question. Google \"Fairness Doctrine\". Google \"Nancy Pelosi rhetoric\". When someone mentions \"talk show ho.....\" You can't get the words out of your mouth before liberals rant about that stinking Rush/Hannity/Beck......blah...blah....taken off the air.....blah, blah.......some way to shut them up.......blah, blah.....hate speech......all while spouting off about the first amendment.\n \n \nIf a conservative is a non-believer.......\n A liberal non-believer......\n\n \n Close call, but I'm going with Easy. There are many Christians who try to \"force\" their beliefs on all. (See above vote on homosexuality) Yet, the \"BAN\" attitude belongs to the liberal non-believers. Don't see too many conservative non-believers stealing nativity scenes off courthouse steps. Don't see too many conservative non-believers suing the city over Christmas trees. \n \n \nIf a conservative decides he needs health care.......\n A liberal demands......\n\n \n Easy again. Very similar to the welfare vote. Conservative wants money = gets job. Conservative wants health care = pays for coverage. Liberal wants money = takes it from conservative/taxpayer/welfare. Liberal wants healthcare = takes it from conservative/taxpayer/single payer\n \n \nIf a conservative slips and falls in a store...... \n If a liberal slips and falls......\n\n \n Jo wins this one. Slipping in a store has nothing to do with affiliation, and everything to do with other value judgements. If the conservative slips on a spill a store employee negligently refused to clean up and breaks his wrist, does he shrug it off , take it like a man, and not sue? After all, he's a conservative. (Although he probably could. He does have healthcare because he pays for it. Come to think of it, the liberal could also shrug it off. The conservative pays for that, too.) Suing, or not suing has nothing to do with political leaning, and everything to do with personal values.",

   "I think the spectrum between Conservatives/Liberals is very wide & there are many shared beliefs or common values in the middle ground.\n\n \n I agree. I personally believe we're all on the same side, and the majority of us are striving for the same goals. It's the means to acheive those goals we differ on, and subsequently argue about.\n \n For instance: Can you name anyone who is against reducing crime? Have you ever run across anyone, liberal or conservative, who has said anything like, \"I sure wish violent crime would go up.\"\n \n No. Yet, I personally believe using an inanimate object (a tool) such as a gun, to protect myself will reduce crime. If everyone carried one, who would you choose to rob/rape/assault? Why do the police carry them? Protection? Why is a gun good for their protection, yet bad for mine?\n \n There are those out there who believe that if you remove the tool, you remove the crime. If nobody had a gun, nobody would be shot, right? I agree. (This fails to address stabbings, bludgeonings, and poisonings, but hey, nobody gets shot.) \n \n There it is. Same goal, different methodology. (even though some methods make more sense than others)\n \n Unfortunately, we've been operating under a two party system. You are either on one side, or the other. It doesn't matter how far left or right, your only choice is A or B. This is the problem with the two party system.\n \n We need to realize that we share many goals in common. We have to figure out a way to vote for a third alternative, or else we'll find that the two party groove we've been riding in is too hard to get out of. We need to find a third party, or we'll find that the groove is really a funnel, and we're all headed the same direction.",

   "Why do the police carry them? Protection? Why is a gun good for their protection, yet bad for mine?\n \n\n \n Well, over here the police don't carry guns, because they're not likely to face people with guns. If they do, then there is an armed response squad to deal with that.\n \n As for the point about their not being many conservative minorities queuing for handouts, there aren't that many conservative minorities to begin with. The only ones who are are those whose economic self-interest (i.e. they're rich and don't want to pay their share of taxes) takes precedence over the racist undertones in a lot of conservative rhetoric. You do see plenty of white conservatives lining up for handouts e.g. medicare. How many of the protestors against \"socialised medicine\" have been seniors in receipt of medicare benefits?\n \n I think what the US needs is what the UK needs - at a minimum an Alternative Vote electoral system and ideally a mixed PR and AV system. Polarisation is a lot harder when the opposition are a mix of parties, both to your left and your right. It's hard to paint your beliefs in terms of absolute freedom if you're a Republican with Libertarians breathing down your neck (or flag waving jingoism with a Fascist party off to the right), and likewise it's hard to claim to be in favour of equality and social justice if you're a Democrat with the Greens and the Communists using your words and really meaning it. FPP systems allow big parties to send mixed messages and take supporters for granted without having to worry about them fleeing to another party. The German SPD can't do that.

When I walk around in Manhattan, I don't often wonder if the people I meet on the streets are armed. Of course, it does involve a certain amount of \"street smart skills\".

As long as the arguments, debates, discussions & what have you, are framed as some sort of quixotic battle between good & evil, we, as a people, will not be prepared for any kind of meaningful progress toward goals or prepared for a progressive form of government or leadership. I think you have misjudged many American people. \n \n \nI heartily accept the motto,-\"That government is best which governs least;\" and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which I also believe,-\"That government is best which governs not at all;\" and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but most governments are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient. \n from Henry David Thoreau's Civil Disobedience\n\n \n \nPoliticians sometimes refer to a status quo. Often there is a policy of deliberate ambiguity, referring to the status quo rather than formalizing the status. Clark Kerr is reported to have said, \"The status quo is the only solution that cannot be vetoed,\" meaning that the status quo cannot simply be decided against; action must be taken if it is to change.\n Status quo - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n \n I think the excessive amount of partisanship, denial & self-justification is an obstacle which hinders progress.\n \n \nYou people hide a human rights bill by burying it in a military funding bill which is imperative to support our troops very survival, and are so hypocritical as to claim some perceived victory of conscience when it passes. Only criminals would link bills like that which cover completely different areas of legislation, but the Left will do it at every turn.\n\n \n I answer this with 2 (rhetorical) questions. \n Why is there always enough money for militarism & not enough money for education, healthcare reform, the arts & sciences (I could go on here but won't)? \n Why did it take so long to get enough support to pass a hate-crimes bill?",

   "I still think the separation of religion & state was a really good idea. Fear mongering? Not so hot.\n \n I read this book a few months ago called The Paranoia Switch: How Terror rewires our brains & reshapes our behavior - & How we can reclaim our courage. While I didn't agree with all of the author's hypotheses or conclusions, I thought it was a pretty interesting read. She describes & makes a case for the results of using a politics based on fear & how it has markedly changed the political climate. As a result of reading this book, I tend to apply the description she uses of the characteristics of the typical fear broker type politician when performing an analysis. These are the short descriptions she uses in the book:\n \n \n1. Fear brokers speak to us of fear, dangerous people, & frightening situations.\n 2. Fear brokers are not limited; they use alarming \"unfacts.\"\n 3. Fear brokers tend to accuse those who disagree with them of being unpatriotic &/or naive.\n 4. Fear brokers look good.\n 5. Fear brokers behave like archetypal parents.\n 6. Fear brokers shame us over sex.\n 7. In a seeming contradiction, fear brokers praise us for being moral & heroic.\n 8. Fear brokers project personal infallibility.\n 9. Fear brokers are secretive, & are certain that other people, too, are keeping dangerous secrets.\n 10.Fear brokers use language that pulls for primitive affect.\n\n \n I think there's a tendency for Republican politicians, talk show hosts, etc. to use this strategy more often. They seem to have adapted the \"Southern Strategy\" (ever since the ploy to attract voters based on the fear of Civil Rights for people of all skin colors has outlived its usefulness to their party). \"Rebranding\" the party seems to have included modifying the (mostly fear based) Southern Strategy to attract fundamentalists Xians. It seems to have worked. I dunno what comes next? \n \n I like this quote about early America: \n \n \nFor all (...of Americans'...) differences, they shared that one brave idea (...of the United States as a new world to start again...), and that idea became the point around which they gathered. After two hundred years this is still the glue that keeps the nation together. It's a fragile construct. And the constant American need forreaffirmation of America's greatness - their exceptionalism - affirms its fragility.\n Wapedia - Wiki: American exceptionalism \n\n \n It IS a fragile construct.\n \n I like also our original de facto motto, E pluribus unum, Latin for \"Out of many one\".\n \n \nNever codified by law, E pluribus unum was considered a de facto motto of the United States until 1956 when the United States Congress passed an act (H.J. Resolution 396), adopting In God We Trust as the official motto.\n E pluribus unum - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n",

Fr'instance - \n \n \nAlford et al. argue that \"genes influence people's outlooks and personalities, and it is these broad features that then predispose individuals toward suites of specific attitudes\" (164). The authors theorize that two \"political phenotypes\" (or personality types) underlie conservatism and liberalism: absolutist and contextualist (164-165). The \"absolutist\" type is characterized by a suspicion of out-groups, a yearning for in-group unity and strong leadership, a desire for clear and unbending rules, and a fondness for retribution; the \"contextualist\" is characterized by tolerance toward out-groups, a context-dependent (as opposed to rule-based) approach to proper behavior, support for equality, and greater empathy. 2\n \n 2 The authors do not mention that the absolutist type is nearly identical to the \"authoritarian personality\" (see, e.g. Adorno et al. 1950; Altemeyer 1996; Feldman 2003; Stenner 2005).\n http://sitemaker.umich.edu/suhay/files/critique_of_twin_studies_--_suhay__kalmoe__mcdermott_101007.pdf\n\n \n I sometimes wonder how these findings can be used to bridge the divide between the 2 broad groups.

   "Once again, painting everything with a very broad brush.\n \n Although it doesn't say it, these \"2 broad but distinct political phenotypes\" will most likely be pointlessly broken down into \"Republican or Democrat\". \n The instinct to categorize, resulting in classification into opposing groups is so ingained in our psyche, even our scientific studies end up doing it.\n \n Can anyone reading the results of the study mata references honestly say they didn't characterize one group with Republicans and the other with Democrats? \n \n We have predisposed conditions in which to categorize our findings.\n \n \n \n So most will instantly say \"Hah! typical conservatives!\".....yet, I'm a strong proponent of carrying guns. Wouldn't this be an \"out group\"? How come these evil out-group castigating conservatives embrace me, while the liberals attempt to alienate and cast me out further? I thought their mantra was acceptance? \"Fondness for retribution\"? You mean like punishing Fox news and only allowing select \"in-group\" media to interview the pay czar?\n \n \n \n Most people reading this would instantly say, \"Hmmmmm. Sounds very liberal.\" (It does, doesn't it?) Yet, why are these \"context-dependent\" rule opposers so fond of cooking up as many gun control laws as they can possibly create? Tolerance of out groups? Sooooo, libearls love the NRA, huh? Support for equality and greater empathy...........\n \n ....but aren't we a nation of laws? Or, does this \"empathy\" mean applying the law, not in accordance with established (set and determined) precedent, but with empathy?\n \n So, since everyone hates the rich and loves the poor, rich people deserve harsher taxes/rules/punishment, whereas the poor should receive lighter scrutiny?\n \n Maybe, according to this empathetic postulate, crimes committed by....oh, let's say.....persons making more than $250,000 a year should receive harsher penalties? (sound familiar?) \n \n ....but....but...doesn't this conflict with this wonderful \"tolerance of out-groups\"?\n \n \n \n Mutually exclusive terms. You either coldly and callously treat everyone equally, without regard to circumastances, or you \"empathize\" and treat one party with regard to special circumstances as opposed with the other.\n \n Which is it? Empathy cannot coexist with equality. Trying to force them to do so only ends with hypocrisy. (Probably why they were both included in the description most would identify with \"liberal\")\n\n \n WoW that is one big mouthful to digest!\n \n My motivation in looking at studies like these is, as I said, because \n \n \nI sometimes wonder how these findings can be used to bridge the divide between the 2 broad groups. Focusing on issues may be important but the underlying beliefs that \"feed\" the opinions about the issues may be a good place to start. Any thoughts on this?\n\n \n The results of most of these studies is a scaled score of sorts. There are extreme types at either end & I suspect they have more in common than the persons falling somewhere in the middle! I also feel by attempting to understand underlying beliefs it may be possible to get closer to bridging the divide.\n \n \nIn the progress of personality, first comes a declaration of independence, then a recognition of interdependence. \n -Henry Van XXXX \n\n \n To paraphrase the above quote, I feel progress of a people, as a nation, may come through first declaring independence but then (& maybe this \"then\" is NOW) through a recognition of interdependence.\n \n You seem to be interested in these studies? This document has one of the earlier studies & includes the survey questions.\n \n \nRight-wing authoritarianism (RWA) is a personality and ideological variable studied in political, social, and personality psychology. It is defined by three attitudinal and behavioral clusters which correlate together:[1][2]\n \n 1.Authoritarian submission - a high degree of submissiveness to the authorities who are perceived to be established and legitimate in the society in which one lives.\n 2.Authoritarian aggression - a general aggressiveness directed against deviants, outgroups, and other people that are perceived to be targets according to established authorities.\n 3.Conventionalism - a high degree of adherence to the traditions and social norms that are perceived to be endorsed by society and its established authorities, and a belief that others in one's society should also be required to adhere to these norms[3].\n Right-wing authoritarianism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n\n \n The following link has the survey questions (starting on page 11 or so): \n \n http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/chapter1.pdf\n \n Have fun!",

Many still think that Obama is Muslim.\n \n If you are an atheist you never ever would get elected President. \n \n Even to accept the theory of evolution as correct is a no no.\n \n The US is a weird country full of weirdos such as these in this forum.
