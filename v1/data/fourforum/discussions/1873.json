   "As usual, the Brady campaign is lying. The senate voted by a narrow margin to attach the riders to the manufaturers liability bill. Then the senate voted and the bill as a whole was defeated 90-8. \n \n Even if it HAD passed the senate (which we knew it wouldn't) it was expected to be killed in the house. \n \n Here is an article on it:\n \n http://www.news-miner.com/Stories/0,1413,113~7244~1993580,00.html\n \n The decisive moment seemed to be during the later arguments on the bill. While they were debating whether or not to ammend the bill to include the assault weapons ban, Feinstein (d-california) claimed that the assault weapons ban legislation \"has reduced the proportion of banned assault weapons traced to crime by two-thirds.\"\n \n \n During final arguments before the completed bill was voted on, Craig (R-Idaho) and Young (R-Alaska) got up there and completely shredded her numbers. IT was made very clear by the end that she was a liar. \n \n God, I love Cspan!\n \n Of course, the Brady campaign has labeled this a \"victory\". They can have all the victories like that (where nothing at all happens) that they can handle. \n \n Teh house is still expected to pass the gun makers protection bill WITHOUT the riders. Senate leadership suggests that it can be fully expected to pass in the senate \"the democrats simply don't have enough votes to stop it\".",

   "\"This bill merely continues the badly flawed 1994 ban, which is a ban in name only,\" states Kristen Rand, VPC legislative director. http://www.vpc.org/press/0403awpass.htm\n \n Hmm. The Violence Policy Center thinks the AWB is bad. Brady says it is good. Which is right?\n \n They say that gun manufacturers easily circumvented the law by manufacturing weapons that did not have banned cosmetic features. But the ban is definitely effective according to BradyCampaign. http://www.bradycampaign.org/press/release.php?release=546 Which is it?\n \n Guns are designed only to kill and maim, but of the millions upon millions of rounds of ammuntion are sold every year in the US, only a fraction are used to hurt others. Did all of the other bullets malfunction? Which is it?",
