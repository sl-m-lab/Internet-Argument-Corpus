Jefferson indicted in bribery probe \n \n \n By LARA JAKES JORDAN and MATTHEW BARAKAT, Associated Press Writer \n 56 minutes ago\n \n \n \n WASHINGTON - Louisiana congressman William Jefferson (news, bio, voting record) received more than $500,000 in bribes and sought millions more in nearly a dozen separate schemes to enrich himself by using his office to broker business deals in Africa, according to a federal indictment Monday. \n \n The charges came almost two years after investigators raided Jefferson's home in Washington and found $90,000 in cash stuffed in his freezer.\n \n The indictment lists 16 counts, including racketeering, soliciting bribes, wire fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice and conspiracy. He faces a possible maximum sentence of 235 years.\n \n He is the first U.S. official to face charges under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits corporate bribery overseas.\n \n Jefferson, through his lawyer, claimed innocence. He will be arraigned Friday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria.\n \n The schemes were complicated and Jefferson set up front companies to hide the money and disperse it to family members, prosecutors said.\n \n \"But the essence of the charges are really very simple: Mr. Jefferson corruptly traded on his good office and on the Congress,\" said Chuck Rosenberg, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria.[/quote]\n \n =snip=",
