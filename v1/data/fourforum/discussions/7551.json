   "I fully expect some to diregard this because it is from a Venezuelan paper, and what would those fools in Venezuela know about what is going on in Venezuela\n \n \nVHeadline.com News Editor Patrick J. O'Donoghue writes: Speaking at a mass rally in Caracas before a multitude of supporters from all over Venezuela to mark the February 4, 1992 (4F) coup anniversary and 7 years in office, Venezuelan President Chavez Frias has made ample reference to the current microphone war between his country and the USA. \n \n Venezuelan Embassy in Washington official, Jenny Figueredo Frias, expelled in reprisal for the Venezuelan government's expulsion of US Naval Military Attache John Correa, will receive a hero's welcome when she arrives here. \n \n The President says Figueredo is instrumental in helping Citgo bring cheap heating oil to poor communities in the USA. \n \n During the speech, Chavez Frias repeated his threat to close Venezuelans oil refineries in the USA ... \"it won't cost me anything to sell oil to other countries that have been asking for more oil ... real allies like China, India, European and Latin American countries.\" \n \n The US Embassy must stop spying, Chavez Frias warns, and if he catches US officials with their fingers in the pie, then they will go to prison before sending them back to the USA. \n \n \"Venezuela does not want to go to such extremes and wants to be left alone ... the imperialist government must accept the reality that Venezuela has been liberated and will never be a colony of the US again.\"\n \n Revealing aspects of alleged Embassy spying activities, Chavez Frias has told supporters that government surveillance forced the officers to change the place where they used to eat arepas ... \"there's one Lt. Colonel that we have staked out and he changed his arepa diner. \"\"\n \n We nearly got Correa and the latter justified his exit, alleging illness ... they sent him home because we nearly grabbed him.\" \n\n \n To put this into a little broader context, this is from USA today, Jan 11:\n \n http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2006-01-11-citgo-cover-usat_x.htm\n \n \nAs Hurricanes Katrina and Rita demonstrated, any disruption to the nation's refining industry instantly increases gas prices. What if Ch\u00e1vez, who periodically threatens to curtail oil shipments to the USA, closed Citgo's refineries?\n \n \"He'd only have to do that for 90 days, and he'd destroy our economy,\" worries Matthew Simmons, a prominent energy investment banker. \"He actually has our livelihood in his hands.\"\n",

He hasn't missed any shipments yet.\n \n Oil coming from Venezuela is what they call heavy crude oil, which has a high sulfur content. The oil refineries in the US are designed to process this heavy crude , which can't be done just anywhere on a large scale.\n \n http://ca.us.biz.yahoo.com/ap/060206/venezuela_oil.html?.v=2",

China has no environmental controls, so the high sulphur content of the oil is not as big an issue. China already intends to increase their imports of sour crude this year by 23%, and their new refinery in Quingdao is due to begin operation early next year and will process ONLY sour crude (high sulpuhur heavy).\n \n Citgo could drop production fairly significantly and their losses would largely be offset by the increased margin on refined products. I read an analysis the other day that estiemated that if Citgo cut production by 50%, it is likely that their profits would only diminish at maximum by only 12%. Venezuela could absorb a 12% decrease in profits from Citgo pretty easily.",
