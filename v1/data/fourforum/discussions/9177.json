   "November 11, 2006\n Beliefs\n A Topic in the Air but One That Political Candidates Declined to Touch: Torture of Prisoners \n By PETER STEINFELS\n The October issue of Theology Today, a scholarly journal published by the Princeton Theological Seminary, featured a series of articles on torture. \"It is a matter of shame,\" writes one of the contributors, Jeremy Waldron, a professor of law at New York University, that \"we have no choice but to conduct a national debate about torture.\" \n \n That debate, Professor Waldron continues, is not about stopping torture by \"corrupt and tyrannical regimes\" but about whether the American people and the American nation want \"to remain part of the international human rights consensus that torture is utterly beyond the pale.\" \n \n There were few if any signs of such a debate in the midterm election campaigns. That cannot simply be because of the government's insistence that the United States abhors torture and does not practice it. The government insists on many things - about the war in Iraq and economic prosperity, for example - that its political opponents do not hesitate to challenge and challenge vociferously. \n \n Torture is different. It is such a stain on personal and national character that nothing but appalling photographs could have forced the subject to the fore. When it comes to pressing the question of official complicity, no stack of equivocating documents can have similar force. In a season of shameless attack ads, torture is still too shameful to be debated. \n \n As for religious reaction, Fleming Rutledge, the Episcopal priest and noted preacher, said in this issue of Theology Today, \"In my lifetime, I do not remember any major public question being so studiously ignored as this one.\" \n \n The journal articles stem from an effort to change that. They are based on presentations at the founding conference, in Princeton last January, of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture. Prominent religious leaders, Protestant (both mainline and evangelical), Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Jewish and Muslim, issued a statement, \"Torture Is a Moral Issue,\" that was a sweet seven sentences in length: \n \n \"Torture violates the basic dignity of the human person that all religions, in their highest ideals, hold dear. It degrades everyone involved - policy makers, perpetrators and victims. It contradicts our nation's most cherished values. Any policies that permit torture and inhumane treatment are shocking and morally intolerable. \n \n \"Nothing less is at stake in the torture abuse crisis than the soul of our nation. What does it signify if torture is condemned in word but allowed in deed? \n \n \"Let America abolish torture now - without exceptions.\" \n \n It is hard to say how much the Theology Today articles add to that succinct statement. In one, William T. Cavanaugh, who teaches theology at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, draws on his previous study of torture by the Pinochet government in Chile. His most provocative observations may be that, however counterintuitive, \"those who torture tend to think of their work in extremely high moral terms.\"\n \n Citing examples from Chile, Professor Cavanaugh notes that \"torturers sometimes imagine their acts as a kind of self-sacrifice on their part: 'What terrible things I must do in order to defend my beloved people!' \"\n \n What goes for the individual torturer can go for the nation as a whole. \"The moral purpose is made more righteous,\" Professor Cavanaugh writes, \"by the extremity of the act of torture itself.\" By definition, \"the threat against the nation must be extremely severe if such an extreme procedure as torture is used.\" \n \n The argument is strangely circular, but it ends in the conviction, he says, that \"only the most morally righteous nation could be trusted with the capacity to use torture for a good purpose.\" \n \n In another article, a leading evangelical ethicist, David P. Gushee, a professor of moral philosophy at Union University in Jackson, Tenn., worries that the United States is \"succumbing to the temptation to waive moral rules that we have every reason to know are applicable to us.\"\n \n \"We know that torture is wrong,\" Dr. Gushee writes, \"but just not now, not in our exceptional case, not in this global war on terror. Yet we are queasy enough, that we do not want to call torture, torture.\" \n \n Instead, he continues, \"we deny that we are torturing, or we deny that our prisoners are really prisoners, or when pushed to the wall, we remind one another of how evil the enemy is and how much worse other countries or ideologies are.\" \n \n \"We give every evidence,\" he concludes, \"of the kind of self-deception so characteristic of the descent into sin.\" \n \n Dr. Gushee has not limited his concern to scholarly pages. Last February he wrote an article for the popular evangelical monthly Christianity Today titled \"5 Reasons Torture Is Always Wrong.\" \n \n All these writers must step carefully around the fact that the president and other American authorities have repeatedly denied that the government tolerates torture - even while they reserve its right to use what are delicately referred to in official parlance as \"enhanced\" or \"alternative\" interrogation techniques.\n \n Obviously, these theologians have something less than complete confidence in such official protestations, and one can understand why. \n \n In a White House compromise with a small group of adamant Republicans, last month's Military Commissions Act, for example, left standing the United States' commitment to Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions protecting prisoners from violence, cruelty, torture and humiliating and degrading treatment. \n \n But while the legislation spelled out certain \"grave breaches\" of Common Article 3 that would constitute war crimes, it also underlined the president's power to interpret the nation's obligations, to define what is grave or not and to screen his definitions from court challenges, and maybe even from public knowledge.\n \n Already, the Central Intelligence Agency has warned that detained Qaeda suspects must not be allowed to disclose their treatment to courts - or perhaps even to their own lawyers - lest other terrorists \"adapt their training to counter the tactics that C.I.A. can employ in interrogations.\" \n \n Is there any way around this lack of transparency? Here is one idea, admittedly inspired not by sober theological analysis but by political ads.\n \n Let all interrogations be videotaped (interrogating off camera would itself be a \"grave breach\"). Three years after any interrogation, the video would be made public. One could assume that by that time terrorists would have learned whatever techniques had then been in use.\n \n The important feature, of course, would be the kind of endorsement now required of campaign advertising - a closing shot of the president on screen. \"This interrogation was paid for by the American people,\" the president would have to say, \"and I approve of its methods.\"",

   "I would like to make some observations about Roman Catholic Latin America:\n \n http://hrw.org/backgrounder/wrd/wrd0106/\n \n \nLatin America is home to some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world. While only three countries-Chile, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic-provide no exceptions or extenuating circumstances for the criminal sanctions on abortion, in most countries and jurisdictions, exceptions are provided only when necessary to save the pregnant woman's life and in certain other narrowly defined circumstances. Even where abortion is not punished by law, women often have severely limited access because of lack of proper regulation and political will.\n \n Advancing access to safe and legal abortion can save women's lives and facilitate women's equality. Women's decisions about abortion are not just about their bodies in the abstract, but rather about their human rights relating to personhood, dignity, and privacy more broadly. Continuing barriers to such decisions in Latin America interfere with women's enjoyment of their rights, and fuel clandestine and unsafe practices, a major cause of maternal mortality in much of the region. . . .\n\n http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/1212-02.htm\n \n \nFOR many Latin American victims of torture, the infamous pictures of abuse at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison brought back not only chilling recollections of their own experiences, but also confirmed what they have long maintained: that their torturers were following interrogation guidelines set by the US Army School of the Americas (SOA). \n \n \"I had flashbacks when I saw the guy with the hood [at Abu Ghraib],\" says Carlos Mauricio, a Salvadorean who was tortured in 1983. Founder of Stop Impunity, a group that seeks to prosecute human rights violators, dismisses as a \"whitewash\" the Bush administration's view that Abu Ghraib abuse was the work of a few US army misfits. \n \n \"What happened at Abu Ghraib was torture by the book; they were implementing US policy,\" Mauricio, 51, told the Sunday Herald. \n \n \"The US military deny they teach torture and say it happens in Latin America because soldiers have always been brutal. But what happened at Abu Ghraib belies this.\" . . .\n",

You're always talking about how he goes the extra mile, carries the other's load, etc. In other words, Jesus doesn't go in for half measures.

He wouldn't worry about where exactly the line defining torture lies, because behavior he would approve of would be so far from that line as to make it irrelevant.\n\n \n It depends on what the subject of the behavior considers torture. The adulteress was told by Christ to \"go and sin no more.\" She could claim that was torturous to have to go against her natural inclination to want sexual fulfillment. We aren't just talking about degree necessarily. We're talking about what constitutes torture and what doesn't. The point is that, depending on the torture used, what is torture for one person may not be for another. For example, making a person who loves rap listen to it several hours a day just might not be torture; making someone who doesn't like it listen to it very well might be. And Judeau is right: the soldiers we send sometimes have to deal with worse than some of the things some call torture. I'm not trying to make an ideological statement about torture here. I'm simply saying that, for a topic such as this, a clear understanding of what we're talking about is pretty important. Something I'd think you (of all people) would be the first to agree with, given your emphasis on getting my view of what morality is, in our last discussion.",

   "January 12, 2005 article on information gained by torture, Washington Post:\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2302-2005Jan11.html\n \n \nThe Torture Myth\n By Anne Applebaum\n Wednesday, January 12, 2005; Page A21 \n Just for a moment, let's pretend that there is no moral, legal or constitutional problem with torture. Let's also imagine a clear-cut case: a terrorist who knows where bombs are about to explode in Iraq. To stop him, it seems that a wide range of Americans would be prepared to endorse \"cruel and unusual\" methods. In advance of confirmation hearings for Attorney General-designate Alberto Gonzales last week, the Wall Street Journal argued that such scenarios must be debated, since \"what's at stake in this controversy is nothing less than the ability of U.S. forces to interrogate enemies who want to murder innocent civilians.\" Alan Dershowitz, the liberal legal scholar, has argued in the past that interrogators in such a case should get a \"torture warrant\" from a judge. Both of these arguments rest on an assumption: that torture -- defined as physical pressure during interrogation -- can be used to extract useful information. \n \n But does torture work? . . . listen to Army Col. Stuart Herrington, a military intelligence specialist who conducted interrogations in Vietnam, Panama and Iraq during Desert Storm, and who was sent by the Pentagon in 2003 -- long before Abu Ghraib -- to assess interrogations in Iraq. Aside from its immorality and its illegality, says Herrington, torture is simply \"not a good way to get information.\" In his experience, nine out of 10 people can be persuaded to talk with no \"stress methods\" at all, let alone cruel and unusual ones. Asked whether that would be true of religiously motivated fanatics, he says that the \"batting average\" might be lower: \"perhaps six out of ten.\" And if you beat up the remaining four? \"They'll just tell you anything to get you to stop.\" \n \n Worse, you'll have the other side effects of torture. It \"endangers our soldiers on the battlefield by encouraging reciprocity.\" It does \"damage to our country's image\" and undermines our credibility in Iraq. That, in the long run, outweighs any theoretical benefit. Herrington's confidential Pentagon report, which he won't discuss but which was leaked to The Post a month ago, goes farther. In that document, he warned that members of an elite military and CIA task force were abusing detainees in Iraq, that their activities could be \"making gratuitous enemies\" and that prisoner abuse \"is counterproductive to the Coalition's efforts to win the cooperation of the Iraqi citizenry.\" Far from rescuing Americans, in other words, the use of \"special methods\" might help explain why the war is going so badly. . . .\n",
