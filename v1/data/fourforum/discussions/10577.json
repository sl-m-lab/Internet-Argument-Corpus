   "I have heard that, in China, with its one-child policy and resulting high number of sex-selective abortions, there is now a crisis of too many young men with no women to marry. \"Over the next two decades, as many as 40 million young Chinese men won't be able to marry, settle down and start families. There won't be enough wives to go around.\" (from http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002/06/19/china-usat.htm ). So, sex-selective abortion has artificially created a social crisis.\n \n As for whether it is a woman's rights issue, if it was the pregnant woman's choice to abort that female embryo, then I do not see it as a woman's rights issue. However, the one-child policy in China, though they will not force a woman into having an abortion, do introduce extremely strong socio-economic incentives for her to do so. Apparently, a second child is strongly discriminated against by the system - in schooling, etc. I have mixed feelings about this since such strong social pressures do effectively take away a woman's (and a couple's) reproductive rights. However, as I recall, if China had not instituted such a one-child policy, there would now be about 300 million more Chinese and the resulting population pressures would have introduced quite negative socioeconomic consequences. It is a matter of balancing the lesser of two evils.",

Oct. 23-24, 2007. N=900 registered voters nationwide. MoE \u00b1 3.\n \n \"Please tell me if you think abortion should be legal or illegal in each of the following situations . . . .\" ...\n \n \"If the pregnancy puts the mother's mental health at risk\"\n 10/23-24/07 58% Legal, 28% Illegal, 16% Unsure\n 2/28 - 3/1/06 62% Legal, 30% Illegal, 8% Usure\n And this is for MENTAL health, which always gives lower numbers than for physical health (they didn't isolate a question about physical health risk). For a question about risk of death under the same poll (10/23-24/07) - 73% Legal, 15% Illegal, 12% Unsure.\n \n ---\n \n Here is another, slightly older, poll which does specifically isolate the physical health question as well as the mental health question, where the mental health question gives very similar results to the Fox News poll. This is from the same web site:\n CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll. Jan. 10-12, 2003. N=1,002 adults nationwide. MoE \u00b1 3. \n \n \"Now I am going to read some specific situations under which an abortion might be considered. For each one, please say whether you think abortion should be legal in that situation, or illegal. How about [see below]?\"\n \n \"When the woman's life is endangered\"\n 85% Legal, 11% Illegal, 2% Depends, 2% Unsure\n \n \"When the woman's physical health is endangered\"\n 77% Legal, 17% Illegal, 4% Depends, 2% Unsure\n ...\n \"When the woman's mental health is endangered\" \n 63% Legal, 32% Illegal, 3% Depends, 2% Unsure---\n So, polls (even from anti-choice news agencies) support that the majority of people would keep abortion legal in the case of risk to a woman's health. From there, the main unanswered question is \"How high a risk\"...\n \nIn any event, I would say the very main question comes down whether or not a person exists over any other question.\n\n Yes and no. Most people seem to have a fairly vague definition in their minds of what EXACTLY a person is but it seems that most people whose arguements I have heard equate the beginning of this vague notion of personhood with the start of rights. This brings up the whole quagmire, which we have been over many times, of what a person actually is - which is deeply tied in with the question of rights and why we have rights to begin with. Anyway, there are no simple answers to this question - which is why we all end up often going in circles with the arguements supporting each of our views.\n \n However, it seems that most would agree (and the polls support this) that, even once the fetus is considered to have a right to life that restricts abortion rights, there are some extenuating circumstances that do weigh the mother's right to life or health over that of the fetus. That is why it is not a simple answer that it is only personhood that matters. Personhood (with all its pitfalls of vagueness) is the start. After that, it is a balance of rights - as most laws are ultimately a balance of competing rights of people.",

I can understand the sorrow that many on the pro-life side might feel toward the embryos who are aborted since I think that they truly do believe that there is a suffering innocent being there, but I cannot agree with their opinion or have the same reaction since I see their view as being based on erroneous assumptions about what that zygote really IS at that point. It has NO feelings, emotions, thoughts, sense of pain, etc.\n\n \n I don't dispute any of the facts you set forth here, I'm just saying I understand why different people might place different interpretations of these facts. What it basically boils down to in my case, is that I have no problem with abortion in the first trimester, but my resistance to the procedure then increases. I would regard the killing of a newborn infant as murder, and I don't really see much difference between that and a just-about-to-be-born foetus. However, I do see a whale of a difference between that about-to-be-born foetus and a zygote.\n \n So, somewhere in that developmental pathway, there is a profound change, and I can see that it is not simple to draw a line as to when it occurs. So I would err on the side of caution.\n \n I also think there is something to be said for simple respect for life, and that it should not be terminated arbitrarily for someone's convenience or pleasure. I don't know of anyone who is \"pro-abortion\", as if it were a desirable procedure that every woman should experience. I think there is pretty much unanimity that abortion is not a good thing, and should be avoided if at all possible.\n \n I've often used the comparison of a zygote to a \"piece of human tissue\", but my mind is by no means settled on this matter. A zygote is a different piece of human tissue, because of its potential. As a result, I think it deserves some respect. Not that it should be respected against the interests of the pregnant woman -- and I keep using that circumlocution instead of \"mother\" advisedly, because it is the woman who decides whether she's going to be a mother -- but I do not believe the interests of a foetus should be arbitrarily dismissed, either.\n \n So for me, abortion should be the last resort, and not routinely used as a fail-safe for faulty contraception. It is the termination of a human life, and I feel that those of us, which includes me, who believe that the right to choose should be left to pregnant women ought to recognise that it is the termination of a life. It's not that such a termination should be utterly prohibited, but it shouldn't be done for trivial reasons, either.\n \n I very much believe in respecting life. So do the vast majority of people who support the right to an abortion. So let's respect it, and admit that abortion is not the equivalent of cutting one's toenails.",

   "From http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm , from a Fox News poll (which I think you would not consider biased in the favor of abortion):\n FOX News/Opinion Dynamics Poll. Oct. 23-24, 2007. N=900 registered voters nationwide. MoE \u00b1 3.\n \n \"Please tell me if you think abortion should be legal or illegal in each of the following situations . . . .\" ...\n \n \"If the pregnancy puts the mother's mental health at risk\"\n 10/23-24/07 58% Legal, 28% Illegal, 16% Unsure\n 2/28 - 3/1/06 62% Legal, 30% Illegal, 8% Usure\n And this is for MENTAL health, which always gives lower numbers than for physical health (they didn't isolate a question about physical health risk). For a question about risk of death under the same poll (10/23-24/07) - 73% Legal, 15% Illegal, 12% Unsure.\n \n ---\n \n Here is another, slightly older, poll which does specifically isolate the physical health question as well as the mental health question, where the mental health question gives very similar results to the Fox News poll. This is from the same web site:\n CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll. Jan. 10-12, 2003. N=1,002 adults nationwide. MoE \u00b1 3. \n \n \"Now I am going to read some specific situations under which an abortion might be considered. For each one, please say whether you think abortion should be legal in that situation, or illegal. How about [see below]?\"\n \n \"When the woman's life is endangered\"\n 85% Legal, 11% Illegal, 2% Depends, 2% Unsure\n \n \"When the woman's physical health is endangered\"\n 77% Legal, 17% Illegal, 4% Depends, 2% Unsure\n ...\n \"When the woman's mental health is endangered\" \n 63% Legal, 32% Illegal, 3% Depends, 2% Unsure---\n So, polls (even from anti-choice news agencies) support that the majority of people would keep abortion legal in the case of risk to a woman's health. From there, the main unanswered question is \"How high a risk\"...\nI've looked at that and I agree I was wrong but if you look at how the question is asked then the answer changes. If you see questions with \"rape, incest, womans life\" and \"womans life only\" that will equal 50% only in those. So it is inconsistent at best. \n \n\n Yes and no. Most people seem to have a fairly vague definition in their minds of what EXACTLY a person is but it seems that most people whose arguements I have heard equate the beginning of this vague notion of personhood with the start of rights. \nI think there are questions that go along after the fact but the very basic one is the person question. If it were thought by all that the fetus is not a person then we really wouldn't have any other question. \n \n \nThis brings up the whole quagmire, which we have been over many times, of what a person actually is - which is deeply tied in with the question of rights and why we have rights to begin with. Anyway, there are no simple answers to this question - which is why we all end up often going in circles with the arguements supporting each of our views.\nSo true :) But you love it haha\n \n \nHowever, it seems that most would agree (and the polls support this) that, even once the fetus is considered to have a right to life that restricts abortion rights, there are some extenuating circumstances that do weigh the mother's right to life or health over that of the fetus. That is why it is not a simple answer that it is only personhood that matters. Personhood (with all its pitfalls of vagueness) is the start. After that, it is a balance of rights - as most laws are ultimately a balance of competing rights of people.\nThese depend on the question asked in my opinion and furthermore, would you not say it is a little inconsistent in the thought process? It seems like when you get down to it the only logical way to say \"yeah, its a person but not important enough to go over some rights\" is to value people differently yet almost no one support other instances of valuing people differently.",

   "I'm very traditional here: one becomes a person at birth. Unborn foetuses aren't persons, in my philosophical view, because they are totally and intimately dependent on the woman for survival, to the extent they could be regarded either as an extension of the woman's body, or alternatively, as a parasite. Once that umbilical is cut, and they are breathing on their own, they become physically independent persons. However, that doesn't mean foetuses have no rights at all. I'd argue they accumulate rights during development, in direct proportion to their degree of sentience, and I'm willing to give a lot of benefit of doubt in the later stages of pregnancy.\nThat's fine but once again not the point I was making. I am not, at this point, arguing whether the unborn is or isn't a person but arguing that this is the main and probably only question needed to be answered.",

If you see questions with \"rape, incest, womans life\" and \"womans life only\" that will equal 50% only in those. So it is inconsistent at best. \n\n I agree that, as is so often the case, the answers to a poll depend largely on how it is phrased. Even in the examples I gave, if one phrases it as a woman's life being \"endangered\" that gives a higher percentage support for abortion rights than a woman's life being \"at risk\", since \"endangered\" seems to suggest a higher risk. The same could be said for stating a risk to a woman's health.\n \n That brings up the whole question, that I also once started a thread on in this forum, about what constitutes a sufficient threat to a woman's health. For example, I think most would agree with a major risk of paralysis being a mitigating factor, whereas most would also agree that having stretch marks or a prolongued cold after the pregnancy would not be a mitigating factor. The trouble lies with all the shades of gray in between. I don't think that this topic has been discussed enough - probably because, as with myself, most people haven't thought enough about specific criteria that would determine when abortions for health reasons would be allowed. Either way, it could be worth further discussion.\n \nI think there are questions that go along after the fact but the very basic one is the person question. If it were thought by all that the fetus is not a person then we really wouldn't have any other question. \n\n Yes, as I said, that is the starting point of discussion of abortion rights - the start of personhood in the fetus. However, once personhood (however that is defined) is achieved, there is still the balance between the rights of the two individuals in question - the mother and the sufficiently developed fetus/person. So, personhood might be the start of the arguement but it is not the end all of the arguement. It seems that most rules of human conduct involve some balance of rights - anything from custody or divorce disputes, to property disputes, to violence that, in some cases, might be justified, etc. \n \nSo true :) But you love it haha\n\n Yes, I admit that I enjoy many of these arguements , even if they do end up repeating themselves and not resolving anything :) . Nonetheless, I think they are useful in demonstrating some of the thought processes that go behind our various points of view - something that is enlightning for all sides, even if we don't agree.\n \nThese depend on the question asked in my opinion and furthermore, would you not say it is a little inconsistent in the thought process? It seems like when you get down to it the only logical way to say \"yeah, its a person but not important enough to go over some rights\" is to value people differently yet almost no one support other instances of valuing people differently.\n\n Many situations in life are not clear cut. If the right to life is absolute, then we would not kill enemy soldiers in wars, we would not kill in self-defense, etc. The same goes for other laws. In generally, people are not purely altruistic martyrs. Rules of human conduct try to balance the competing self-interests of the full range of individuals, as well as factoring in the interests of the community at large.",

The zygote is not just random human tissue since the chance is very high that, if left alone, it will grow into an individual like you or me. That is significant from a moral sense but it doesn't step up to the level of morality that one can legislate, in my view. People cheat and lie to each other all the time. That is something I also think is immoral but, apart from business relationships and marriage vows, it is not something that is legislated. There are those that think that people should have sex only if they want to procriate. They might think others are immoral who view sexual relations as independent of the desire to procriate. \n \n Though I would hope that women who have unwanted pregnancies take a general respect for the potential of early human life into account, I do not believe that it is something that steps up to the level of being legislatable.

Preaching mainly abstinence, as is the case for most of the pro-life side, is all well and good if it is listened to but the abstinence case has not been effective for the great majority of teenagers - mainly because there IS an alternative that gets around the negatives of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease while letting them keep the pleasure of sex: namely responsible sex.

Ultimately, the public decides and, to aid in that process, I would love to see more public debates on abortion - moderated in a way that would limit emotion outbursts on either side and keep the debate calm and make the two sides actually respond to each other. That is a tall order. Among other things, it often comes down to competing world views between religion and science. \n \n It seems that most people in the US try to find some balance between the two world views but the arguements on abortion typically either consider one world view or the other. Even in this forum, I would love to hear more voices from people who hold more moderate religious beliefs that try to balance with scientific understanding.
