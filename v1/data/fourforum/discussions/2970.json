This hole national debt BS is only brought up by Liberals whenever it suits them. Ithink you all said the same exact thing under Reagan and the economy chugged along just fine. I've heard that experts around the world, those without an agenda that is, have attributed much to Reaganomics, but for those to admit that on the Left is tantamount to an admission that your entire belief system is and has been wrong, so I don't really expect you to be able to face the truth now. Furthermore, the amount being spent in Iraq is a drop in the bucket when you look at the entire budget-get real\n \n \nWell, I don't have figures (and I somehow think yours are made up :p ) but there was a lot of talk about the split when Nader ran. IMO, more of the \"left\" have principles... the \"right\" only have their fanatic devotion to the party. That's \"blind loyalty\" not principles.\n\n \n LMAO It's actually common sense really. Nader got HOW many percent of the vote in 2000, maybe 2-4 percent. I think it's REAL safe to say that he did not steal any of the Republicans who MIGHT have wanted to vote for Gore. Perot got how many percent, maybe 18-20 I believe. Perot, if I recall correctly, was coming across as a \"Conservative\", so how many DEMOCRATIC votes could he have taken (from those that WOULD have voted for BUSH)? I think a safe guess would be none, THEREFORE, seems to me that 20% of Republicans voted their conscince VS. mayb 4% of Democrats voting theirs in 2000. SO who is REALLY blindly fanatical?\n \n \n \nIrrational? Hardly. I disagree majorly with his policy, find it inconcievable that people can still back him, find him irresponsible, and yes, he is a liar in my eyes. Lying by implication and omission is still lying to me. Clinton may have \"technically\" told the truth, but obviously he was lying by implication. Both intentionally misled the American people.\n\n \n I'm talking psychotically irrational, you betcha. You all are so desperate to pin something, ANYTHING on Bush, you actually still think this Iraq thing was a lie on his part. If you had a child who several people said had done something that deserved punishment, and you took action based on those witnesses, you were relying on the information provided in order to decide what punishment to administer, If it turned out later that they were incorrect, would you consder yourself a liar for having punished the child? I realize not the greatest analogy, but the since the simple circumstances surrounding Bush are too difficult for you to understand, I had to try to simplify it for you.\n \n \nI suppose. Can you point out a \"rabid\" liberal? Moore is certainly far left, but I find it hard to label him \"rabid\". He's really not irrational, and isn't even as offensive as you and other \"right-wingers\" I've seen on this board are. Whether or not he lied is really immaterial in these terms.\n[/QUOTE]\n \n See, this proves without a doubt your fanaticism for your party. Take Moore, an absolutely disgusting excuse for a human being, as far left as you can possibly be, and yet you find ways to defend him and then try to portray me and other like-thinkers as being fanatical. We happen to support Bush, but not fanatically. Remember, Clinton's polls went up after he did NOTHING but get caught lying (a fact, remember?). Just based on people THINKING Bush lied, his polls have dropped. THAT does NOT reflect fanatical support",

I don't think this will become a major issue for another 3 or 4 years, though, when the middle class actually wakes up and realises that they have become the lower class.\n \n \n \n \nI'm talking psychotically irrational, you betcha.

I realize not the greatest analogy, but the since the simple circumstances surrounding Bush are too difficult for you to understand, I had to try to simplify it for you.\n\n \n Personally, i don't think Buish lied about the situation in Iraq as far as WMD's went. I think he honestly believed they were there, despite the evidence to the contrary. It seems to me that we shoul;d still be seriously questioning his qualifications to lead the country, though. If he had waited another few weeks before begining mobilisation of our military, we would have had the final report of the UN inspection team. We also would not have allowed hundreds fo weapons that the UN inspectors had control over to disapear.\n \n To me, this is somewhat simimlar to the whole Clinton sex scandle. I don't really care if he got a hummer from his intern, I do care that he apparently did not have the common sense to deal with the situation without getting himself impeached. The lack of judgement was astounding.\n \n The same is true with Bush and the whole Iraq situation. We had inspectors on the gound doing their job and reporting that th Iraqis were cooperating. They asked for 2 more weeks to finish up their inspections. I think it shows an incredible lack of judgement on the part of the Bush administration to squander hundreds of billions of dollars of American taxpayer money, tie up our military (which frankly has better things to do) and polarise world opinion against us, without giving those guys the little bit of time they were asking for. \n \n \nSee, this proves without a doubt your fanaticism for your party.

THAT does NOT reflect fanatical support\n\n \n I don't think the left fanatically supports their party, I think it is a fanatical hatred of the right that drives them. Too many views that are traditionaly leftist views simply make no sense from a logical standpoint for it to simply be a question of fanatical support of their own party. If you think about it, a lot of the \"leftists\" seem to hold the views they do not becuase they are well thought out and sensible, but merely because they are contrary to the views of the right.",

From my link:\n \"In addition to the 3.5 percent raise in basic pay, both committees also approved raising BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing) to the point where it will pay 100 percent of the average housing costs. This concludes DOD's five-year plan to completely eliminate out-of-pocket housing expenses by FY 2005 (average out-of-pocket housing expenses in FY 2004 is 3.5 percent).\n \n This is the first time in five years that Congress will not \"target\" the pay raise by giving some ranks a higher raise percentage than other ranks. In FY 2004, the average pay raise was 4.1 percent, but some members received as little as 3.7 percent, while others received as much as 6.25 percent. In 2005, all members will receive a base pay raise of 3.5 percent.\n \n This is the sixth consecutive year that Congress will approve a pay raise larger than the level of private sector pay raises. Once implemented, this raise is expected to decrease the \"pay gap\" from 5.5 percent to 5.1 percent. \"\n \n What part of that is can't you comprehend? They have attempted to reduce out-of-pocket housing costs to ZERO, CIPHER, NADDA, ZILCH, OUGHT, NAUGHT, ZIP. \n \n\n That is a problem you didn't mention. While CONGRESS, NOT BUSH, has increased spending for military healthcare, their increases are lower then average, while a estimated 120,000 new veterns are using these funds. In a sense, they have actually CUT the amount of money avaliable to each vetern and their family. So in reality, each vetern and their family have less money avaliable to them then before. I'd like to see you wiggle your way out of THAT. \n\n Again with the Democratic bookkeeping tactic. Just because the RATE OF INCREASE is lower doesn't make it a CUT. If you think that you're getting a 10% raise but your boss actually gives you a 5% raise, did you get a salary cut? NO, you still got an increase.\n \n\n Yes it does. Without a fresh batch of new students interested in science, we WILL be left behind. We will be forced to import scientists, pay money to educate them, and watch them return to their home countries. Science starts at the very early level. Many students are truned off to science due to the lack of enthusasim from poorely paid and poorely funded teachers. Science is the foundation upon which this country spreads it's influence, without it we will fall behind. You cannot simply BUY scientists, you must get them on the track from their early days in elementary.\n\n \n Obviously you haven't been paying attention. We import scientists TODAY because too many young kids prefer to take the easy way out and major in Liberal Arts instead of science. Before we can produce more US scientists, we have to get more US students to enter scientific undergrad programs, on that we agree, but Federal funding doesn't have anything to do with that. And we don't have to worry about too many of the foreign scientists returning home. The pay for scientists in the US is much higher than it is in their homelands and jobs are easier to obtain, especially if they don't have to compete with entry-level American scientists coming out of school.",

In it, they calculated the net effects of all of the environmental regulations as an increase in the average life expectancy as well as look at other factors that have a negative impact on life expectancy using cost/benefit anayysis techniques and found that all of the environmental regulations imposed to date may have increased the average life expectancy by a few days, IIRC.

I visit many Indian, Middle Eastern and Asian engineers working at the Big Three's engineering facilities all of the time. One of the reasons that Dearborne has the highest concentration of Middle Easterners outside of the Middle East is because many of them work in the auto industry as engineers and in other professional capacities. You can't find an American doctor without looking real hard because most of them in the area are Asian or Indian. Don't believe me? Do a search on physicians in the SE Michigan area. It reads like a New Dehli phonebook.\n The first chemist that I trained under right out of school was Indian.

How much cheaper is a comparable car in the Ukraine vs one in the US? For that matter, what's the cost of a comparable car in China? The cost of living difference argument falls flat on its face when you're buying international goods like cars, Nikes, Levis. \n In the Ukraine, 29% live below the poverty line and 3% live in extreme poverty.\n http://www.bsec-business.org/country_inf.asp?category=11\n \n\n As a consequence of the shortcomings of economic reform and a deep economic crisis generated by the fall of the eastern markets and the low capacity of adaptation to a competitive economic environment, the years following the start of economic and political transition wittnessed a sharp decrease in the living standards, both in Ukraine and Romania. In fact, given the huge proportions of this phenomenon, it is adequate to speak not just about the expansion of social marginality, but also about an en mass pauperisation, which affects the life standards of the majority of population.\n \n The fall of production and of markets had a negative effect on the real income of the population. In Transcarpathian Ukraine the average income is even below the country's average (monthly 161.3 hrivnya - about 40 USD). The income pro capita is 49.0 hrivnya (13 USD), while the official amount of the subsistence wage is 91 hrivnya. They bring the food either from Hungary or from Slovakia in the private shops and markets (1 kg. pork is about 2-3 USD, 1 liter milk 20 cents, 1 liter oil 1 USD). \n http://www.policy.hu/szilagyi/respaper1.htm\n \n\n \n Next time you want to argue, bring some facts.",
