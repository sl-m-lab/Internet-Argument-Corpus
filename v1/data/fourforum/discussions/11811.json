   "Dear friends:\n \n THIS IS EXTREMELY SERIOUS.\n \n Minutes ago I spoke with friend Dr. Norman G. Marvin, M.D. and he is so concerned at what he has learned about Barack Obama's family in Kenya that he is calling a special prayer meeting in his home to pray against the witchcraft curses attempted by them against John McCain and Sarah Palin.\n \n Dr. Marvin sent me the below e-mail from Flo Ellers. Flo is credentialed with the International Fellowship of Ministries which is based in Washington State. She is also a member of EndTime Handmaidens and Servants of Jasper, Arkansas.\n \n IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO SPIRITUAL WARFARE, PLEASE PRAY TODAY AND CONTINUALLY THAT ALL SUCH CURSES BE BROKEN AND SATAN'S PLAN FOR AMERICA BE DEFEATED, IN JESUS' NAME. PRAY AND COVER MCCAIN AND PALIN WITH THE BLOOD OF CHRIST. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO SPIRITUAL WARFARE, IT IS TIME YOU LEARN!!!\n \n Jim\n ______________________________________\n \n From Flo Ellers. Excerpt. (Emphasis supplied in bold and underlines.)\n \n Two days ago, I listened to a 9-6-08 message by Bree Keyton, a young woman evangelist who had just traveled to Kenya and visited Obama's home village and what she found out about his relations with his tribal people was chilling. And his \"cousin\" Odinga was dreadful. She said the witches, warlocks and those involved in satanism and the occult get up daily at 3 a.m. to release curses against McCain and Palin so B. Hussein Obama is elected.\n \n Bree Keyton told the tribal \"Christians\" you are NOT Christian if you practice \"tribalism\" where they do voodoo to conjure up a goddess spirit or a \"genie\" and then come to church on Sunday to worship Jesus! What she discovered there is apparent in most churches around the world; namely, mixture in the church. Some renounced their devilish practices of blood covenant by killing sheep, goats, humans to be inducted into the tribe or to get a wife or to get revenge.\n \n She said the current president of Kenya is a Christian. However, Obama's cousin Odinga ran aganist him and said he rigged the election and stirred up the masses to rape woman and boys, kill and burn and torture Christians, etc. until Obama contacted Condeleeza Rice and she granted Obama the right to contact Odinga and other ruling elders and he \"convinced\" them to stop terrorizing the Christians. Bree Keyton said the current Christian President was forced by our government (!) to \"create\" an office for Odinga (to make \"peace\") so he was made the Prime Minister (!) to make peace between the Christians and Odinga's Muslim religion!\n \n Bree Keyton went and visited Obama's tribal people and she found out Obama is 75% Arab and his family are Muslims. Odinga is strill trying to become the President of Kenya. If he does, he will make a law forbidding all public preaching and institute Sharia Law. Bree K. said Odinga has made a pact with satan.\n \n Bree K. also said when Obama visited his tribe in '06 and as late as Jan. '08 he went to every elder's home which has a \"shrine\" inside to worship the genie and asked for their blessing. She was told Obama and Odinga were both \"destined\" before they were born to be president/leader of their nation. They say \"he is the chosen one\". She said Obama's grandmother sacrificed a black and a white chicken to the \"goddess of the river\" so both whites and blacks will vote for Obama. All Islam loves and worships Obama. The world is mesmerized by him. Oprah's 200 million followers are out to elect Obama. Also, Dick Morris of Fox News was sent to Kenya to help Odinga run his campaign! I find that unbelievable.\n \n The occultists are \"weaving lazy 8's around McCain's mind to make him look confused and like an idiot\". Bree K. said we need to break these curses off of him that are being sent from Kenya.\n \n I read a portion of \"Obama Nation\" book and looked at several websites and found most of this information to be true, all except the curses part, of course....\n \n End of excerpt.http://www.injesus.com/index.php?module=message&task=view&MID=CB007FA2&GroupID=2A004N9G&label=&paging=all\n emoticon_frazzled\n emoticon_xdonno\n I swear.\n I am routinely amazed at the depths that some of the \"McCain supporters\" will go to.",

   "The following is a \"column\" from World Net Daily.\n Anybody who doesn't need convincing that World Nut Daily caters to extreme absurdity, often stepping over into the \"firmly lying\" category might be advised to skip it, out of an interest in taste...\n If, however, you have an interest in one of the more recent examples of WND's tastelessness and total separation from objectivity, proceed onwards ...\n \n \n This week, I decided to do something different &#8211; my column is in video form. It's a newscast from a future we must make sure we never see. In it, you'll get a glimpse into our nation should Barack Obama be elected president &#8211; complete with the kinds of people he'll appoint and policies he'll enact based on Sen. Obama's real promises, positions, record and advisers. It would be comical if it weren't so scary. It is an eye-opening look at what the future could hold if we don't do everything we can to prevent it.\n \n I encourage you to watch it (rather than read it) and forward it to everyone you know in an effort to sound the alarm before it's too late &#8230; or the news we watch next January will look something like this:\n \n Video at Web-site...\n \n It's January 22, 2009, for 911 News, I'm Janet Porter. Two days after the inauguration of Barack Obama as president, the Middle Eastern reaction is the same. (VIDEO: TERRORISTS DANCING IN THE STREETS.) Obama campaign supporters from al-Qaida to Hamas to Hezbollah, to Islamic Jihad and the Muslim Brotherhood, continue to dance in the streets.\n \n The \"Death to America Coalition\" released a statement: \"We have not celebrated like this since 9/11!\"\n \n President Obama thanked campaign contributor William Ayers by appointing him as director of Homeland Security. Ayers, who bombed the Pentagon, and after 9/11 said he wished he could have done more, in a statement released today, said, \"Now I can.\"\n \n President Obama's close friend, mentor and pastor of 20 years, Jeremiah Wright, accepted the appointment to oversee the president's Faith Based Initiative program with the condition he would quit calling for God to damn America in public.\n \n Obama made good on his long-held campaign promise dating back to 1996, when he told the \"Independent voters of Illinois\" he would outlaw all handguns. Reiterating his words on the campaign trail, Obama told gun owners to \"quit being bitter and clinging to the Second Amendment of the Constitution.\"\n \n President Obama followed through on his campaign promise to sign the \"Freedom of Choice Act\" as his first act in office. (VIDEO FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD SPEECH MAKING PROMISE.) This effectively wipes out every pro-life law from parental notice to every ban on partial-birth abortion in all 50 states.\n [*]* NICKIE NAEVE, 14 year old: \"Now that Obama's president, I can get an abortion and mom or dad will never ever know!\"[*] * SANDY SLAUGHTER from KTAI (Kill Them All International): \"You just worked 36 years for nothing! When Obama won we won! Ha!\"The only thing left of the abortion agenda not yet accomplished is the forced abortion policy of China.\n \n It's been said the ACORN doesn't fall far from the tree, and with a message of gratitude for all their hard work in the elections, President Obama increased federal funding in his budget for the group best know for voting fraud. Senators were warned by ACORN if they voted against their increase in taxpayer funds, they would suffer an enormous backlash from deceased voters in their districts.\n \n Obama said he misspoke when he referred to his health care plan as \"socialized medicine,\" saying, \"The term 'socialism' has been given a bad rap\" and returning to the discussion of \"government takeover of health care\" and the fines for those who won't submit.\n \n First lady Michelle Obama spent the day reading from her favorite books to elementary school children.\n MICHELLE OBAMA READING TO CHILDREN: \"Mr. Ayres knew America was a bad country so he and his lovely wife formed a club called 'The Weather Underground.' (To children) Can you say 'Weather Underground'?\"\n \n CHILDREN REPEAT: \"Weather Underground.\"\n \n MICHELLE: \"They took action and stood up for what they believed (turning children's book page) in the Pentagon &#8230;\"\n \n CHILDREN: \"Ka-Boom!\"\n \n JOHNNIE RAISES HIS HAND: \"Mrs. Obama? Did Mr. Ayres ever say he was sorry for blowing up the Pentagon?\"\n \n MICHELLE: \"No, but nobody really cares about that. Let's move to our next book, \"Heather and Her Two Mommies aren't Proud of their Imperialist Country.'\"\n President Obama appointed his economic adviser and the former CEO of Fannie Mae, Franklin Raines, as secretary of the treasury this week. Raines took office and promised to do for the American economy what he did for the housing industry. Referring to his campaign contribution to Obama's campaign, Raines was reported to have said, \"That was the best $126,000 we ever spent.\"\n \n As Senator John McCain predicted, the Russian aggression has moved to the Ukraine. Russian tanks rolled in and soldiers began to burn homes, schools and hospitals this morning. President Obama's immediate reaction was, once again, \"We're not sure who's at fault, but this administration stands firm on the principle that we should all get along.\"\n \n After he had time to talk to his 300 foreign affairs advisers, President Obama's official statement was: \"Present!\"\n \n As was predicted, successful small businesses and job-providing corporations are closing their doors and moving overseas to escape the enormous tax hikes the Obama administration has imposed in an effort to use them to redistribute or \"spread\" the wealth. Another victim of this administration's class warfare is Joe the Plumber, who was made famous during the final presidential debate, who is moving from his beloved Holland, Ohio, to Holland. He said they're socialists too, but at least they're honest about it.\n \n President Obama responded, \"That's OK, I'll get him with the global tax I tried to pass in the Senate.\"\n \n The Osama bin Laden video released yesterday has been shown to be authentic.\n OSAMA speaks in Arabic.\n \n TRANSLATOR: I am looking forward to meeting with President Barack Obama without preconditions to negotiate our demands of \"submit or die.\" We have much in common: the same supporters, the same allies and we both have friends who blew up the Pentagon.\n ....\n \n And now the Obama administration is reaching the arm of censorship beyond radio into the television airwaves, starting with new &#8230; SCREEN TO SNOW.\n \n Voice over: Help save Western Civilization. Vote McCain/Palin.\n A newscast from a future we must never see\n \n 1) I think this pretty much epitomizes why I think WND is a pile of garbage...\n \n 2) I'm curious as to how many people will think of this as \"vetting\"... :rolls\n How many people will think of this as a \"job well done\".... emoticon_frazzled",

Bashing opposing cantidates is what most people do with this forum, and I don't care if you do it or not. But just for the hell of it, suppose there's a teenage girl with as much self control as Bill Clinton. Would it be reasonable for me to walk up to her brother, tell him that his sister's a whore, and say that it's not an attack because it's factually accurate? I don't think so... True or not it's still an attack. I've attacked Osama, you've attacked McCain, what else do people do here?\n \n \nblah, blah, blah...\n Your menial complaints are just as unpleasant, if not with the additional flaw of having no real point...\n\n \n You say this as if it's the only thing I addressed that point with...\n \n \nSee, the funny thing about this is that WE AGREE on this.\n But somehow, me pointing this out makes ME the bad guy... emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n For that matter, why does this make me the \"bad guy\" as you say?\n \n \n \nConsidered, and rejected.\n I will discuss others in appropriate threads...\n\n \n So you're just going to keep attacking McCain by focusing on the extermists of the extreme? Contrary to your beliefs, it's easier to balance on solid ground.\n \n \nBut the thing I think you want to sweep under the table is that there IS a concentrated \"grassroots\" effort to put out the most grotesque lies about Obama, and SOME people are still falling for this junk.\n\n \n Lies? What have I ever said about Osama that is a lie?\n \n \nOr at least having it raise questions to the extent that it pushes their vote towards McCain.\n\n \n What? You're now saying that I shouldn't stand for the cantidate that I want in office? I knew the left was against free-speech!\n \n \nRecently, I heard that the \"Obama is a muslim\" lie is impacting as much as 10% of the voter base to question the situation, even though most people should recognize that he's clearly not.\n\n \n If you know it all, then what religion is he?\n \n \nYou want to start a new thread on that subject, then do so.\n This thread ain't about that.\n Nor do people who say \"Palin's a racist\" excuse the people I am quoting.\n\n \n I was making a comparison, but you're trying to make it sound like I was changing the subject. Read again.\n \n \nBut just out of curiousity, when you repeat the above, does that mean you are attacking Obama?\n Or does that mean you are attacking Obama supporters?\n \n Or maybe...\n Just maybe you recognize that your earlier claim is pure malarky and you don't see your comment as \"attacking\" anybody... emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n This from a guy who said that his claims weren't an attack because they were accurate? \n \n \nemoticon_wow emoticon_frazzled\n I am routinely bored by people who try to make arguments through strawman argument.\n \n 1) John WOULD BE \"a McCain supporter who robbed a store\".\n That would be true and factual.\n \n 2) I have been routinely saying that SOME McCain supporters are radicals.\n That is also factual and true.\n\n \n Yes, but this is not the same as \"McCain supporters are bank robbers.
