   "I'm going to post a full article from the Wall Street Journal because I presume that not everyone has access to its resources (Also, the Journal article is at odds with my own position):\n \n 'Freakonomics' Abortion Research Is Faulted by a Pair of Economists\n By JON E. HILSENRATH \n Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n November 28, 2005; Page A2\n Prepare to be second-guessed.\n \n That would have been useful advice for Steven Levitt, the University of Chicago economist and author of the smash-hit book \"Freakonomics,\" which uses statistics to explore the hidden truths of everything from corruption in sumo wrestling to the dangers of owning a swimming pool.\n \n The book's neon-orange cover title advises readers to \"prepare to be dazzled,\" and its sales have lived up to the hype. A million copies of the book are in print. The book, which was written with New York Times writer Stephen Dubner, has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 31 weeks and is atop The Wall Street Journal's list of bestsellers in the business category.\n \n But now economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston are taking aim at the statistics behind one of Mr. Levitt's most controversial chapters. Mr. Levitt asserts there is a link between the legalization of abortion in the early 1970s and the drop in crime rates in the 1990s. Christopher Foote, a senior economist at the Boston Fed, and Christopher Goetz, a research assistant, say the research behind that conclusion is faulty.\n \n Long before he became a best-selling author, Mr. Levitt, 38 years old, had established a reputation among economists as a careful researcher who produced first-rate statistical studies on surprising subjects. In 2003, the American Economic Association named him the nation's best economist under 40, one of the most prestigious distinctions in the field. His abortion research was published in 2001 in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, an academic journal. (He was the subject of a page-one Wall Street Journal story in the same year.)\n \n The \"Freakonomics\" chapter on abortion grew out of statistical studies Mr. Levitt and a co-author, Yale Law School Prof. John Donohue, conducted on the subject. The theory: Unwanted children are more likely to become troubled adolescents, prone to crime and drug use, than are wanted children. When abortion was legalized in the 1970s, a whole generation of unwanted births were averted, leading to a drop in crime nearly two decades later when this phantom generation would have come of age.\n \n The Boston Fed's Mr. Foote says he spotted a missing formula in the programming of Mr. Levitt's original research. He argues the programming oversight made it difficult to pick up other factors that might have influenced crime rates during the 1980s and 1990s, like the crack wave that waxed and waned during that period. He also argues that in producing the research, Mr. Levitt should have counted arrests on a per-capita basis. Instead, he counted overall arrests. After he adjusted for both factors, Mr. Foote says, the abortion effect disappeared.\n \n \"There are no statistical grounds for believing that the hypothetical youths who were aborted as fetuses would have been more likely to commit crimes had they reached maturity than the actual youths who developed from fetuses and carried to term,\" the authors assert in the report. Their work doesn't represent an official view of the Fed.\n \n Mr. Foote, 40, taught in Harvard's economics department between 1996 and 2002; served stints as an economist on the Council of Economic Advisers in 1994, 1995, 2002 and 2003; and served as an economic adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad, Iraq, in 2003 and 2004.\n \n Mr. Levitt counters that Mr. Foote is looking only at a narrow subset of his overall work on abortion and crime, so his results are of limited value, and not grounds for dismissing the whole theory. He acknowledges the programming error, but says taken by itself, that error doesn't put much of a dent in his work. (Mr. Foote's result depends on changing that formula and on the adjustment for per-capita arrests.) Moreover, Mr. Levitt says the abortion theory has held up when examined in other countries, like Canada and Australia, and when applied to other subjects, like drug use.\n \n \"Does this change my mind on the issue? Absolutely not,\" Mr. Levitt says.\n \n This isn't the first time Mr. Levitt's abortion research has come under attack. Other academics have tried to poke holes in it, and critics across the political spectrum found the research offensive. Conservatives were appalled that it found such positive consequences from a practice many of them found immoral. Liberals felt it smacked of eugenics.\n \n Mr. Levitt has asserted all along that he is just a dispassionate researcher doing what any economist does, exploring for unseen causes and consequences in human activity. Still, he hasn't shied away from the reputation he has acquired as a \"rogue\" economist, as he is described on the \"Freakonomics\" jacket.\n \n Mr. Levitt's book has become the subject of endless water-cooler talk in the profession. Many economists are thrilled with the attention he is bringing the field and the way he uses provocative subjects -- like sumo wrestlers -- to show how people respond to incentives. Some complain the book, with its offbeat title and easy narrative tone, in some way trivializes economic research.\n \n Still, as economic debates go, this one is relatively civil. Mr. Foote praises Mr. Levitt for making all of his data and his programming easily accessible and hastens to add that \"in many ways it is a very careful paper.\" Mr. Levitt responds, \"I think this is exactly the way science should work,\" with controversial theories being poked and prodded for their robustness.\n \n Edward Glaeser, a Harvard professor who helped referee Mr. Levitt's original abortion submission to the Quarterly Journal of Economics, said the Foote critique isn't damning, though it does suggest the impact of abortion on crime has not been as strong as Mr. Levitt has argued. \"These guys have put the [data] through the wringer,\" Mr. Glaeser says of Mr. Foote and his research assistant. \"There is no question that the results get smaller and weaker, but there still seems to be something there.\"",

   "I have heard of the study, but remain somewhat skeptical. Certainly it makes some sense, but other studies I've seen suggest the number of abortions remained fairly constant between it being illegal and then becoming legal. This obviously wouldn't jive with this sort of study. I'll have to explore further.\n \n Thanks for the links :)",
