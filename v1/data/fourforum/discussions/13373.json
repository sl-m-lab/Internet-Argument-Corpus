   "DALLAS - A Texas judge cleared the way for two Dallas men to get a divorce, ruling Thursday that Texas' ban on same-sex marriage violates the constitutional guarantee to equal protection under the law.\n \n Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said he'd appeal the ruling, which he labeled an attempt to strike down the ban approved by voters in 2005.\n \n \"The laws and constitution of the State of Texas define marriage as an institution involving one man and one woman,\" Abbott said in a written statement. \"Today's ruling purports to strike down that constitutional definition - despite the fact that it was recently adopted by 75 percent of Texas voters.\"\n \n Abbott has argued that because the state doesn't recognize gay marriage, its courts can't dissolve one through divorce.\n \n District Judge Tena Callahan's ruled Thursday, however, that the court \"has jurisdiction to hear a suit for divorce filed by persons legally married in another jurisdiction.\"\n \n Jennifer Pizer, marriage project director for the New York-based gay rights group Lambda Legal, said it is too early to predict the ultimate implications of the lawsuit, in which neither man is identified.\n \n But Cathy Adams, president of the conservative Texas Eagle Forum, characterized the decision as a judicial overreach.\n \n \"Judicial activism is what they're after, and it sounds as if they found someone in Dallas to participate in their endeavor,\" she said. \"The people of Texas have spoken very strongly in opposition to same-sex marriage.\"\n \n Peter Schulte, an attorney for the man who filed for divorce, told The Dallas Morning News that he and his client are \"ecstatic\" over the court's ruling. Schulte said the decision was a surprise, and that he hoped to have the judge sign a divorce order in a few weeks.\n \n Gov. Rick Perry said state lawmakers and voters have repeatedly affirmed marriage as being between a man and a woman.\n \n \"I believe the ruling is flawed and should be appealed,\" Perry said.\n \n Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said she also supports Abbott's decision to appeal. Hutchison, who is challenging Perry in the GOP gubernatorial primary, said she has \"consistently voted to preserve the sanctity of marriage and as governor I will continue to defend traditional marriage.\"\n \n A phone message left by The Associated Press at court offices for Callahan was not immediately returned late Thursday. Callahan's ruling was first reported in The Dallas Morning News.\n \n Pizer predicted an eventual end to bans on gay marriage in Texas and across the country.\n \n \"Most people do recognize that, eventually, American law will treat gays and lesbians the same as every other American,\" she said. \"What we don't know is how may chapters that story will be.\"\n\n \n Texas Judge Clears Way for Gay Divorce - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News - FOXNews.com\n \n Interesting piece. It's seems clear to me that this ruling is a prime example of judicial activism. This judge is suppose to uphold the constitution of Texas which clearly states that these two men do not have a recognized marriage. \n \n \nSec. 32. MARRIAGE. (a) Marriage in this state shall consist only of the union of one man and one woman.\n \n (b) This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage. \n\n \n The judges statement that it violates the equal protection clause doesn't hold water either. \n \n \nSec. 3a. EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW. Equality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of sex, race, color, creed, or national origin. This amendment is self-operative.\n\n \n Nowhere in the Texas equal protection clause does it mention sexual preference or marital status.\n \n Its my opinion that regardless of where one stands on this issue this is a clear case of judicial activism and this judge should be reprimanded or removed for ruling in direct contridiction to the Texas constitution.",

   "There is no marriage under Texas law.\n There is nothing \"like\" marriage under Texas law.\n \n But proclaiming that it isn't a \"union\" is ridiculous.\n The Texas law does not forbid any sort of \"union\" between two people who aren't a man and a woman, married.\n \n\n \n Being as you now conceed they have no \"marriage or marriage like union\" in the state of Texas you should be able to see why they can't grant a divorce and why this ruliung will be shot down on appeal. A divorce is the legal termination of a marriage, no marriage = nothing to divorce.\n \n I don't know how to make that anymore plain for you.\n \n \nHave you ever tried to divide jointly owned property without a divorce?\n\n \n Several times.\n \n \nA divorce provides a person to be able to say to a court \"Make this person split this property with me\"\n\n \n Don't need a divorce for that.\n \n \nIf a brother and sister own a house together, and the brother refuses to sell, there is nothing the sister can do to make him sell.\n The brother can say \"I will buy your share for $1\", and there is NOTHING the court can do to make the brother up his bid.\n\n \n This is not true. In most states the sister would be required to offer the brother first right of refusal. If the brother was unwilling to pay fair value a court can grant approval to sell to a third party. A court can also order the entire property sold and the proceeds split accordingly. These types of proceeding happen all the time and trust me they are no more difficult then a messy divorce.\n \n \nLike I said. I have a friend who went through this junk. She owned property with her previous partner who was VERY uncooperative in the split.\n Since they weren't married, the courts had no grounds for getting involved in most of it.\n Were there any laws broken? Nope!\n So the courts had no grounds to force anything... \n\n \n Your friend did have avenues in the court. Any lawyer practicing real estate/ property law would be able to help her.\n \n \nStrawman argument.\n Matthew obviously referenced the federal constitution, as am I.\n For the federal constitution, it SPECIFICALLY LISTS NOTHING in the equal protection clause.\n Not even race.\n\n \n Since this was a district court family judge I assumed she was refering to the Texas constitution, but even if she wasn't she still has no grounds. The U.S. constitution, at least as its always been interpreted, does not require one state to recognize licenses issued in another state. Examples abound: CCW, business license, etc. Furthermore, Texas's DOMA isn't unconstitutional under the U.S. constitution for the same reason the federal DOMA isn't. It treats every person in Texas equally.\n \n \nDude.\n You want to deny divorce from gay people.\n My proof of my statement is IN THIS THREAD.\n So don't pull this lame \"you don't know me\" junk.\n Your actions speak louder than your obfuscation.\n\n \n Again your assuming things about me that you have no knowledge about. I haven't said that I want to deny anybody anything. What I have said is that this was an activist ruling and I've quoted Texas law and constitution to back that opinion. As I've told you before I don't think gov't should be involved in marriage at all. So again I would advise you against the baseless assumptions and snide remarks, there not helping your argument.\n \n \nI know another gay couple where the guy (Bob) was working for his partners veterinary business for over a decade.\n If it were a heterosexual marriage, it would have been recognized as a joint business.\n But for Bob, nothing was ACTUALLY in his name.\n \n They broke up.\n Guess what Bob's legal standing was to get compensation?\n Guess what Bob's \"retirement benefits\" were?\n\n \n No offense but Bob is an id10t. Why would anyone be co-owner/ partner in a business without some sort of written legal acknowledgement of it. No marriage, no business contract, no ownership papers, what the heck was Bob thinking.\n \n \nOn another level, here's something simple for you.\n Which would you rather have...\n 1) Straight divorce as is. With all its \"complications\" of alimony and child support and etc, etc.\n 2) Instead of straight divorce, you get what GAYS have for divorce.\n Absolutely nothing in most states.\n You and the bitter ex-wife have to argue about who gets the dog. You get to argue about how much she MIGHT get per month in alimony. You get to argue about where the kids might go.\n \n Let me know your choice...\n\n \n Are you still beating your dog? You choices of answers don't accurately represent reality. The reality is that any co-owners of property, married or not, have avenues within the civil court system to settle these matters. To say property can't be divided by the court because the two people aren't married is simply untrue.",

   "The US constitution says\n \n \n \n It does not say we recommend or only if you want too or we suggest. IT says SHALL BE GIVEN. I don't know how much clearer you can get. The second part does not give congress the power to let the states out of their obligation to give full faith and credit. \n\n \n If as you say the 14th requires one state to recognize a marriage license from another then explain the following:\n Why is my concealed carry license from Alaska not required to be recognized in California?\n Why is a business license in Oregon not valid in Montana?\n Why can't a licensed electrician in NewYork work under that license in Virginia?\n \n The fact is that the 14th, as currently interpreted by the courts, does not require states to recognize licenses issued in other states.\n \n \nYes it could under California law sexual orientation is a protected class yet a majority of voters stripped fundamental rights from a protected class. This means that if the majority of voters in the State of Michigan wanted to remove the religious freedoms of say Catholics they could. By amending the Michigan state constitution to outlaw the practice of Catholicism. By your standards a judge would be an activist if he ruled against the anti catholic amendment on the grounds of equal protection. Also read the Michigan state constitution. In the end you can not have it both ways you can not say that the people can vote against gays but religion is off limits. When fundamental rights go on the ballot everyone loses. \n\n \n In order for this to be true California's constitution would have to list sexual orientation as a protected class, not just California law. As California's DOMA is a constitutional ammendment it supercedes law. I was unable to find any mention of sexual orientation in California's equal protections clause.\n \n \nOnce again you would then support a judge upholding that constitution if the constitution was amended to remove religious freedom from Catholics.\n\n \n I would support any judge making rulings based on the constitution as written. If I didn't like what was written in the constitution there are avenues for changing it but activist judges shouldn't be one of those avenues.\n \n This judge clearly made a ruling that is in direct contridiction to the Texas constitution and is unsupported by the federal constitution.",

The states must recognize all licenses if they recognize any licenses from the other states. This argument is pointless with you. You seem to believe that there should be unjust laws.

A divorce is the legal termination of a marriage, no marriage = nothing to divorce.\n\n You're refusing to see the forest for the trees.\n \n \"Equal protection\" covers MORE than just the NAME of marriage.\n It covers the benefits and rights INCLUDED IN marriage.\n \n You insist on seeing \"divorce\" as applicable ONLY TO marriage.\n \n There is another \"marriage-like\" issue called \"common law marriages\".\n They never got married either. But they STILL GET DIVORCED in states that recognize \"common law marriages\".\n They still HAVE TO FILE for divorce if that state recognizes them as \"common law married\", even though they NEVER got married in the first place.\n \n The lack of equal protection here extends to the actual issue of the divorce.\n Furthermore, it would be conceivable if Texas were to declare \"we're going to call this a \"non-divorce divorce\", that could possibly be legally satisfactory.\n \n But you insisting it can't be a divorce if there was no marriage is missing the bigger picture.\n \n \n \nI don't know how to make that anymore plain for you.\n\n Ditto.\n Except in my case, I UNDERSTAND what you're saying... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nSeveral times.\n Don't need a divorce for that.\n\n :xbanghead\n Man. If only the stubbornness you display could be harnessed for a purpose of good...\n You do not NEED a divorce for that.\n But the point is that if a participant is obstinate and refusing, then the divorce makes it infinitely easier.\n \n If you're dealing with a person who is REFUSING to sell the property, then what legal recourse do you REALLY have?\n For \"divorce\", you get a judge to push the issue. HE makes a decision and enforces the resolution.\n \n \n \nThis is not true. In most states the sister would be required to offer the brother first right of refusal. If the brother was unwilling to pay fair value a court can grant approval to sell to a third party. A court can also order the entire property sold and the proceeds split accordingly. These types of proceeding happen all the time and trust me they are no more difficult then a messy divorce.\n\n No. I won't \"trust you\".\n Cause I've got friends who HAVE GONE THROUGH this stuff, and I know it took them YEARS to resolve a situation that would have been much more cheaply and quickly resolved with a divorce.\n \n \n \nYour friend did have avenues in the court. Any lawyer practicing real estate/ property law would be able to help her.\n\n And she DID go to a lawyer for help.\n The point is how much more EXPENSIVE and DRAWN OUT that process became.\n MUCH more painful.\n \n \n \nSince this was a district court family judge I assumed she was refering to the Texas constitution, but even if she wasn't she still has no grounds.

I haven't said that I want to deny anybody anything.\n\n Stop with the b.s.\n Answer a simple question.\n Do you think gays should be granted divorce in Texas?\n Yes or No.\n \n \n \nWhat I have said is that this was an activist ruling and I've quoted Texas law and constitution to back that opinion.

You pigs to fly and beggars to ride on horses.\n I get that...\n \n Now, getting back to reality...\n As far as what you want with regards to ACHIEVABLE ends...\n Which is it?\n \n \n \nNo offense but Bob is an id10t. Why would anyone be co-owner/ partner in a business without some sort of written legal acknowledgement of it. No marriage, no business contract, no ownership papers, what the heck was Bob thinking.\n\n To some degree, I would agree.\n To another degree, you do realize that \"common law marriages\" exist in this country, right?\n You DO realize that this sort of situation (sans gay) is EXACTLY what they were enacted to address.\n \n Furthermore, I can't help but think about your \"desires\" for \"I don't think gov't should be involved in marriage at all\".\n You would exacerbate such situations on one hand ...\n ... and on the other hand make a much higher profit for lawyers who would be needed to draw up endless amounts of documents before people could \"marry\" cause you just did away with governmental marriage.\n emoticon_rolleyes\n Another reason why I think people who talk about \"get government out of marriage\" have no clue what they are talking about.
