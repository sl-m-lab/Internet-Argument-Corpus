Mike Penner dies at 52; Los Angeles Times sportswriter -- latimes.com Although any suicide is a sad event, it is very telling that mike considered his decision to transition from male to female to be a life changing and life correcting choice which would undo a wrong committed against him by nature/God whom he obviously thought got it wrong by making him a male originally.\n \n Interestingly though, only one year later he took back his male name and identity followed up with this tragedy of completely abandoning life. How sad and poignant is the message that no matter how hard we try, we cannot improve on how we were originally created. And now, as we consider his journey, he now knows all too well what he had in life as a male. I sincerely mourn his loss and wish that rather than kill himself, he had groped out into the darkness of this world and sought a truth greater than what his own mind could conceive of. Because had He done that, God promises that He would have found him.",
