   "I hate the \"Phelps\" issue, but I think it possibly helps me understand the \"anti-flag burning\" crowd more regarding the reaction that it brings up for them.\n I typically try to stick to my principles, but on this issue I find myself wondering if I could sacrifice free speech in exchange for civility.\n \n He holds his \"protest\" in a \"public\" place (cemetary), but does that mean people have the right to disrupt it wantonly?\n \n If John and Jane Smith were having a picnic in the park, would my \"freedoms\" allow me to set up camp one foot away from them?

It doesn't mean you get to set up camp within the funeral party to \"make your point\".\n If the precept of a space limit is accepted, I guess the next step is how far away you can limit the involvement. And judging from the court rulings, it looks like that has been an issue in a few of the \"Phelps'\" cases.",

   "An excellent essay, worth reading by all. http://uspolitics.einnews.com/article.php?nid=360524\n \n Excerpt (emphasis mine): \nWithout going too deep into their own propaganda--which is jaw-dropper for anyone who has a taste for the absurd--it is safe to say that the church has nothing to do with religion at all. But to see how the Bible could be distorted to fit the delusions of America's Christian Nazis, it is necessary to look back at how war and religion have coexisted comfortably since about 5 minutes after historical Jesus was crucified.\n \n Without defamating legitimate Christianity, there are problems with the doctrine that allow an immoral minority to justify despicable acts in the name of God. The most significant problem is the practice of using the Bible as an ultimate authority reference without employing any cerebral faculties whatsoever. In it one can find holy justification for almost every human action as well as universal redemption for anyone who converts, confesses or convinces others that this is the genuine word of God. It is the equivalent of no-fault insurance, a license to lead in the vacuum of righteousness, and an all-powerful motivator toward social disintegration in the name of God. And there is nothing more gratifying than the end of the story- the book of Revelations- which is the final pay-off for all of those dogmatic believers who just can't wait to tell the rest of the world \"I told you so\".\n \n But is it really the word of God? The legitimacy of the Bible is immediately suspect once one questions why the writings of the Apostle Thomas were left out of the final version. These have recently been uncovered and thoroughly studies by the historian Elaine Page who explains why Thomas was unacceptable to the Church fathers. The reason is earthly power. By the 4th century CE the authority of the Roman Empire had virtually evaporated, leaving the Western world without much secular leadership. Enter Augustine of Hippo; this Church father is credited with establishing much of the worldly Church authority in his famous writings, and in doing so he provided the justification of the Catholic Church to not only intervene in political affairs, but to actively legitimize rulers by allowing them to claim the virtue of God in their office. Among other things Augustine expanded the concept of the \"just war\", which was the biblical equivalent of using state power in the name of pursuing God's will.\n \n The Crusades of the 11th century is a vivid example of how the \"just war\" theory was applied. Pope Urban VIII was able to rally Europe's leaders to contribute to an offensive war against Islam, which had captured the Holy Lands of Israel. Although the actions ultimately failed and caused more harm than good in the Middle East, the Catholic Church set an important precedent in calling for military actions to fulfill political ends. The next great Church father--Thomas Aquinas--further solidified the notion of \"just war\" by setting certain scholastic criteria which had to be met before a conflict could be resolved with the conflicting passages in the Bible that called for pacifism. No matter what the outcome, since the Bible remained a Latin exclusive for the clergy and was reserved for the Church to do all the interpreting for the rulers that needed God on their side. And so the doctrine was further edified.\n \n And Martin Luther was no help in mediating the Bible's militaristic interpretation; the 16th and 17th centuries were the bloodiest for Europe's Christians, who fought in a series of wars that were apparently blessed for both sides to spread the conflicts. While historians claim that the 30-Year's War in the 17th century was the last conflict in which religion was the key motivator, this theory is quickly being chipped away at. The French Revolution, the Crimean War of 1853 and even World War I were born of religious discontent, but finally by 1918 many church leaders of the numerous Christian denominations were saying that enough is enough, and began to promote the pacifism that Jesus preached--at least according to those dusty passages in a selectively-read Bible.\n \n At least until the advent of Bolshevism in 1917, which was also a conflict in which religion played a major role. Most religions saw the spread of Communism, liberalism and even tolerance as a threat to their survival, and so Enlightenment teachings were jettisoned in favor of a more reactionary interpretation of the Bible. Specifically, the Catholic Church had been on the losing side of the debates since 1871, and Hitler died a Catholic while Pope Pius XII excommunicated everyone and anyone who ever embraced Communism. Only after Vatican II in the 1960's did Catholicism embrace a more enlightened tolerance, although condoms and homosexuality remain anathema to Rome's doctrine.\n \n Which takes us back to Kansas. The Westboro Baptist Church is simply following 2,000 years of Christian tradition in its message of violent opposition to human realities which it considers to be in violation of the Bible. As we have seen with other Christian leaders of the intolerant churches, many of those preachers, senators and politicians are actually closet homosexuals who can't deal with their orientation. Let this article be a call to Reverend Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church to do the right thing: come out of the closet and leave America's fallen soldiers alone. \n",

I have a problem with Phelps disrupting funerals no matter who those funerals happen to be memorializing. There was word that Phelps and company were going to protest the funerals of the Virginia Tech slaughter victims, none of whom died as a result of joining the military. I had a problem with that. In short, I do not only have a problem with Phelps when he protests the funeral \"of some idiot who joined up to get slaugthered in Bushes little vendetta war\" (by which I assume you mean a US soldier); I have a problem with Phelps when he protests anyone's funeral.\n \n And it's not the protesting that I have a problem with. What I have a problem with is Phelps' disruption of a funeral. I would oppose any law trying to shut him up, but I do favor any law that would, say, constrain him to only being within x number of feet of a funeral procession of any person.\n \n \nNow to the civil case I agree he should have lost that one. He has the freedom of speech to protest the funerals but needs to live up to the responsiblity of his actions. With freedom comes responsiblity.\n\n It is precisely the civil penalties which Phelps is going to claim are unconstitutional.",

   "So, if he's kept 100 yards from a funeral, isn't that \"trying to shut him up\"? \n\n \n Well, in this particular case, I'd say it's not shutting him so much as preventing him from causing a public nuisance to others in pursuit of their legitimate business. I think this is a borderline case, and moving him a few hundred yards away from a funeral -- and this applies only to military funerals if I recall -- is not really much of an infringement of his freedom of speech. Mourners have rights in public, too, and a funeral is often a mixed private and public event -- where you come down probably depends on whether you are thinking more of the mourners or the protesters.\n \n \nPersonally, I do think he should be shut up and he's pretty sick and evil, and his message serves no one except his overblown sense of self-importance; however, where does freedom of speech play in this? I really don't understand how far the constitutional law reaches into this situation.\n\n \n Constitutionally, speech hasn't been considered an absolute freedom -- no-one has the right to stand up anywhere and say anything they please at any time they fancy. Courts have allowed reasonable restrictions that try to balance freedom of public expression with freedom from public nuisance. I'll agree it's not an easy line to police in such a way that everyone is satisfied. For example, the so-called \"free speech zones\" at Bush's campaign appearances in 2004 seemed to me to go way over the line, and much further than anything done against Phelps.\n \n I tend to sit in a camp that doesn't support absolute free speech right on a knee jerk basis, but is very suspicious of any attempts to limit it. I think it's right to be suspicious of any anti-demonstration laws, and they do deserve extensive scrutiny. If a court were to strike down this law, I wouldn't mount the barricades in its defence, but at the same time, I don't regard it as particularly inhibiting to free speech. Phelps and his klan can still say everything they want to -- a couple of hundred yards away. Their presence will still be reported and registered, they just won't be able to confront a mourning family directly with their malevolence.",
