   "Alan, I truly would like to know more about Hobbes and those who stood in opposition to what Hobbes believed, inasmuch as his philosophies seem to underlie currient beliefs in Western culture (British and US culture, at any rate).\n \n I am perfectly capable of saying something asinine about Hobbes from my state of ignorance but everyone seems to be bored by Hobbes and won't respond.\n \n For example, noted rightwing pundit George Will has referred to Hobbes:\n \nThomas Hobbes was born in 1588, the year Protestant England defeated the armada of Catholic Spain. He lived 91 years, through the sectarian strife of England's Civil War and the regicide of Charles I. Hobbes wanted tranquillity. His project was to establish the philosophic foundations of government that could guarantee safety.\n \n He said that without government -- in what Hobbes called the ''state of nature'' -- even sociability itself was problematic because life was ''solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.'' To escape such horrors, people would make a rational, if stark, social contract. They would consent to surrender their natural rights in order to empower a severely strong government that would at least release them from fear of violent death.\nHmm, Will actually uses the term \"social contract,\" which is another topic I should like to see delineated.\n \n I keep having the gut feeling that the concept of \"social contract\" is damned as a liberal conceit.",

But maybe it does.\n \n What about the bloody Arminians? Bramhall? Wallis? Lord! Lord! Are we paying for our unresolved disputes in the historical past? Have we forgotten the essence of what we are arguing about?",

   "You have instigated a number of points of departure for a discussion of Hobbes. \n \n Have you tried reading his Leviathan in which he attempts to give a systematic account of human nature, political obligation, and law? It is not an easy read and I never got through the whole thing, but I didn't have to because it was subsidiary \"background reading\" to my main studies: it has literary merit.\n \n Hobbes believed in natural law as a system of principles which all rational beings will recognise. He thought that natural law could not be enforced or obeyed in a \"state of nature\" - which is a state of war of every man against every man. Since natural law has authority but no power, security can only be acquired by means of a sort of social contract. \n \n Perhaps this is enough to begin with: I await your next missile.",
