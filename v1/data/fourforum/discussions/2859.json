   "Here is a list of known logical fallacies.\n \n Be sure to use it to point out which one the anti- user is using everytime they resort to it.\n \n http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html\n \n Here are some ones I have observed the anti-s use time and time again.\n \n Appeal To Anonymous Authority: \n an Appeal To Authority is made, but the authority is not named. For example, \"Experts agree that ..\", \"scientists say ..\" or even \"they say ..\". This makes the information impossible to verify, and brings up the very real possibility that the arguer himself doesn't know who the experts are. In that case, he may just be spreading a rumor. \n \n The situation is even worse if the arguer admits it's a rumor. \n \n \n Bad Analogy: \n claiming that two situations are highly similar, when they aren't. For example, \"The solar system reminds me of an atom, with planets orbiting the sun like electrons orbiting the nucleus. We know that electrons can jump from orbit to orbit; so we must look to ancient records for sightings of planets jumping from orbit to orbit also.\" \n \n Or, \"Minds, like rivers, can be broad. The broader the river, the shallower it is. Therefore, the broader the mind, the shallower it is.\" \n \n Or, \"We have pure food and drug laws; why can't we have laws to keep movie-makers from giving us filth?\" \n \n \n Extended Analogy: \n the claim that two things, both analogous to a third thing, are therefore analogous to each other. For example, this debate: \n \"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\" \n \"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported Martin Luther King.\" \n \"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for Black liberation? How dare you!\" \n A person who advocates a particular position (say, about gun control) may be told that Hitler believed the same thing. The clear implication is that the position is somehow tainted. But Hitler also believed that window drapes should go all the way to the floor. Does that mean people with such drapes are monsters? \n \n False Cause: \n assuming that because two things happened, the first one caused the second one. (Sequence is not causation.) For example, \"Before women got the vote, there were no nuclear weapons.\" Or, \"Every time my brother Bill accompanies me to Fenway Park, the Red Sox are sure to lose.\" \n Essentially, these are arguments that the sun goes down because we've turned on the street lights. \n \n Appeal To Widespread Belief (Bandwagon Argument, Peer Pressure, Appeal to Common Practice): \n the claim, as evidence for an idea, that many people believe it, or used to believe it, or do it. \n If the discussion is about social conventions, such as \"good manners\", then this is a reasonable line of argument. \n \n However, in the 1800's there was a widespread belief that bloodletting cured sickness. All of these people were not just wrong, but horribly wrong, because in fact it made people sicker. Clearly, the popularity of an idea is no guarantee that it's right. \n \n Similarly, a common justification for bribery is that \"Everybody does it\". And in the past, this was a justification for slavery. \n \n Slippery Slope Fallacy (Camel's Nose) \n there is an old saying about how if you allow a camel to poke his nose into the tent, soon the whole camel will follow. \n \n The fallacy here is the assumption that something is wrong because it is right next to something that is wrong. Or, it is wrong because it could slide towards something that is wrong. \n \n For example, \"Allowing abortion in the first week of pregnancy would lead to allowing it in the ninth month.\" Or, \"If we legalize marijuana, then more people will try heroin.\" Or, \"If I make an exception for you then I'll have to make an exception for everyone.\" \n \n \n Argument By Selective Reading: \n making it seem as if the weakest of an opponent's arguments was the best he had. Suppose the opponent gave a strong argument X and also a weaker argument Y. Simply rebut Y and then say the opponent has made a weak case. \n \n This is a relative of Argument By Selective Observation, in that the arguer overlooks arguments that he does not like. It is also related to Straw Man (Fallacy Of Extension), in that the opponent's argument is not being fairly represented. \n \n Argument By Generalization: \n drawing a broad conclusion from a small number of perhaps unrepresentative cases. (The cases may be unrepresentative because of Selective Observation.) For example, \"They say 1 out of every 5 people is Chinese. How is this possible? I know hundreds of people, and none of them is Chinese.\" So, by generalization, there aren't any Chinese anywhere. This is connected to the Fallacy Of The General Rule. \n \n Similarly, \"Because we allow terminally ill patients to use heroin, we should allow everyone to use heroin.\" \n \n It is also possible to under-generalize. For example, \n \n \"A man who had killed both of his grandmothers declared himself rehabilitated, on the grounds that he could not conceivably repeat his offense in the absence of any further grandmothers.\" \n -- \"Ports Of Call\" by Jack Vance \n \n Straw Man (Fallacy Of Extension): \n attacking an exaggerated or caricatured version of your opponent's position. \n For example, the claim that \"evolution means a dog giving birth to a cat.\" \n \n Another example: \"Senator Jones says that we should not fund the attack submarine program. I disagree entirely. I can't understand why he wants to leave us defenseless like that.\" \n \n On the Internet, it is common to exaggerate the opponent's position so that a comparison can be made between the opponent and Hitler. \n \n Remember: NEVER be afraid to call a fallacy user of their use of lies.",

Essentially, it's a put up or shutup tactic. Needling would attack a person with jabs that were irrevelant to the subject at hand (aka, you're a weak XXXXX who can't do ****, and you're mother's a sex provider). I don't do that, so technically, your claim is misguided.

We all know what Rush has said, it is published time and time again, and much of what he says is a pack of lies. While one has not listened to it, does not mean they lack the ability to disprove Rush's printed claims. A actual form of argument by laziness is the creationist argument aganist evolution, hence the \"if we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?\" question. Very few creationists actually understand evolution, yet many think they do. \n \n Ah, but some do read the stuff he does. Aka, that volcanoes release more gases into the atmosphere. That is a outright lie, and i'll prove it. \n \n The eruption of Mt. Pinatubo spewed out 1000 times more ozone depleting chemicals in one eruption than all the fluorocarbonsmanufactured by man...EVER.

Similarly, oceans produce large volumes of sea salt, which contains chlorine, on a daily basis. If these compounds accumulated in large quantities in the stratosphere, they might produce ozone depletion.

However, that is unlikely, so I have little other options to support. Equal rights are a worthy cause of increasing government slighty. Besides, the gay population, even if they do represent 10% of the population, won't make a significent impact on government.

YOUR authority is the final word, and others authority is automatically fallacy?\n\n \n Rush's claim is not only unscientific, but relies on known lies, which have been proven in the link I gave you, but you were too lazy to read. You have just commited the fallacy of argument by laziness. Republicans, not conservatives, are notorious for disregarding science as well as making pure lies up about science. If you cannot disprove the EPA, shut up. You are attempting another fallacy, fallacy of poisoing the well, attempting to discredit the source but not the article. It is quite clear you have the inability to actually prove anything you say, nor disprove anything I say. \n \n \nOn another thread, you \"yawned\". Said you weren't being challenged. You've accused me of \"causing trouble\", so at least give me credit for not making you yawn.\n\n \n Show me, perhaps, but you aren't much of a challenge either. \n \n \nYOU posted a link to the EPA. Am I changing the subject if I ask what makes a corrupt bureaucracy infinitely more authoritative than a group of conservative scientests????\n\n \n You said this: \n\"argument by laziness\". Most people who call Limbaugh a liar never listen to him, and they'll usually admit it.\n\n \n I backed up the argument that he is a liar, and therefore disproved your claim of the fallacy. I was simply taking up the challenge you inadvertely gave. If you think that is true, back it up, but unlikely considering how you have contiunally failed to do so in the past. Here is a list of fallacies you have used. \n \n Argument By Laziness (Argument By Uninformed Opinion): \n Argument By Pigheadedness (Doggedness): \n Changing The Subject (Digression, Red Herring, Misdirection, False Emphasis): \n Extended Analogy: \n Argument By Selective Reading: \n Non Sequitur: \n Poisoning The Wells: \n \n Just to name a few. \n \n Btw, by ignoring much of my post you have conceded that you cannot argue it and therefore forfeit many of the points.",

   "How did you know if I didn't read your EPA link, do you have supernatural powers? The $7 billion, 18,000 employee EPA machine is quite capable of putting up charts and graphs and assertions to justify it's existance, beyond what an average person can disprove. What you should realize about Limbaugh is that he is well known enough, and hated enough, to have an impressive staff working for him to dig deeply into these things, as well as other sources working against him. Every word he says is carefully monitored by the left, and he can't keep his place in the private sector if he lies much. He has other well known talk show hosts competing with him. The EPA has no competition.\n\n \n The silly sheeple who are his fanbase will believe anything he tells them to believe. That's how he gets to keep his place in the private sector.\n \n \nIf I can't disprove the EPA, shut up?? My my, it can get a little brutal in the gay rights forum, can't it? That goes along with the domestic violence aspect of it I guess. emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n Gays and lesbians are not more likely to be domestically violent. That has already been shown to be a lie in this forum. There is no connection between being a gay or lesbian person, and being a domestically violent person. \n \n \nIt IS getting a little uncomfortable here. With the \"shut up\" order, a debatable post in a non-debate forum, imaginary friends, supernatural powers, short memories, and of course, the ignoring of MY posts, I think I'll vacate. If you miss me Duo, stop in at the environmental forum, I'll be keeping an eye on it for at least a couple of weeks.\n\n \n Your posts were off-topic for this thread. It's not about Limbaugh and the left versus the right, liberals versus conservatives, regarding any topic one can think of.",

   "Yes, I see you posted about this in the open forum, too bad that forum's rule is \"chit chat without debates\". Oh well.\n\n \n Then open a new debate in the correct forum. A argument about non-gay fallacies and their users does not belong in a gay forum. Exactly why should a anti-socialism debate rage on in a humor forum? It doesn't make sense, so kindly take your argument somewhere more pertinant. \n \n \nHmmm - short memory - you're anti-capitalist post was from 7-28, less than two weeks ago. The \"will Bush do anything for the environment\" thread. You seemed to blame capitalism for special interest influence, not big government.\n\n \n Once again, you misinterpret or outright fabricate to suit your argument. Let's examine what you poorly claim, here is a link, so that we can properly examine what you choose not to quote.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=60552#post60552\n \n There is a single piece that would lend a slight chip towards your argument. \n \n \nIMO special interests (money) will always overcome most objections from our primarily apathetic and sadly undereducated public. \n \n Welcome to the world of Capitalism\n\n \n Explain to me how that is blantanly anti-capitalistic. If you can, but considering how you have consistancy failed to meet every challenge given to you, I don't expect you to. \n \n \nHow did you know if I didn't read your EPA link, do you have supernatural powers?\n\n \n Because nothing to said lends any crediblity that you did read it. All you did was bash the EPA without doing anything to disprove the article, nor that Rush is a proven liar. You have just commited the fallacy of poising the wells. \n \n \nWhat you should realize about Limbaugh is that he is well known enough, and hated enough, to have an impressive staff working for him to dig deeply into these things, as well as other sources working against him.\n\n \n Once again you consistancy fail to prove anything you say nor disprove anything I say. \n \n \nThe EPA has no competition\n\n \n Just as you prove your complete and utter failure to disprove them. \n \n Either get back on subject, or get out.",

Liberals seldom use it.\n\n \n ACK, I must not be liberal anymore then. Crud.\n Sorry, I just had to say that... \n I try to use logic as often as possible, it's just that sometimes there are arguments where logic goes right out the window.

   "Either get back on subject, or get out.\n\n \n \n Ok, so I am assuming the subject is about the typical arguments against gay rights, specifically marriage. Am I right? \n \n If so, I would hope that the arguments can be kept to a NON-religious ilk. As religion tends to be the first and foremost reason used against granting equal access to rights and liberties when speaking of gay men and lesbians. This just drives me nuts. Religion tends to come into the argument when people simply are personally against some form of personal liberties of which they already have, yet wish to respress for the rest of the population or a specific group. \n The religious arguments were utilized when women were attempting to gain the right to vote, they were used when interracial marriage came into question as well as de-segragation. If we look further back, not in the history of this country per se...but religious arguments were used in regard to the earth being deamed as round, the earth not being the center of the universe and so on. \n So, if it's not too much to ask. Can we please leave the religious arguments out of this thread?\n \n I know, I'm coming into this really late in the game and that there hasn't really been a lot of discussion about the arguement utilized on the \"anti\" side. \n What I have read seems to be private discussion about whether someone's original post was valid or not. \n ACK! \n Get over it. It's valid simply because it's there.",

   "Ok, so I am assuming the subject is about the typical arguments against gay rights, specifically marriage. Am I right?\n\n \n Pretty much. The point of this thread was to highlight the man fallacies the antis are using as well as keep it around blaring in their faces, in a attempt to stop them from using fallacies. As you can see, neither Mana'ia nor Jaaaman have the guts to post here. \n \n The religious argument is essentially a form of majority oppression. \n Every anti-argument boils down to lies, fallacies and majority oppression. None of the anti-s here have been able to refute me on this claim, nor has anyone else on a myraid of other forums.",
