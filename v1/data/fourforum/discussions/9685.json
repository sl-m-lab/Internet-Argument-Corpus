   "http://www.tomdispatch.com/index.mhtml?pid=177784_\n \n Girl on Fire\n Confessions of a Former Journalistic Neophyte\n By Meghann Farnsworth\n I was the adult, a 25-year old journalism student on my first reporting trip abroad. She was the child, 16 going on 40. I had the translator, the driver waiting outside, a hotel room in the safest part of the city, a ticket out of the country in three days. She had her mother, fidgeting nervously in the waiting room, a multitude of STD tests, a house she rarely left in a violent neighborhood, and one of the most dangerous gangs in Guatemala City threatening her life if she talked.\n \n A journalist's job is to ask questions. Journalism school emphasizes the need to get \"color,\" \"scenes,\" \"details.\" Final articles are to be written in an authoritative, confident voice. And yet, what rules of engagement apply when a reporter -- OK, in my case a young reporter -- is faced with a source as vulnerable and traumatized as this girl?\n \n Increasing violence against women in Guatemala City, that was what I had come down to investigate. Although I knew my subject, had read the literature, the government briefings and the daily local news reports, there was no way I could have prepared myself for the reality. Covering violence means being physically exposed to its final product: its victims, dead or alive.\n \n Two weeks, visiting the morgue, the cemetery, prosecutors, police, human rights lawyers, forensic scientists, a women's shelter, families of victims. A litany of horrors running through my head. Nearly 600 Guatemalan women murdered in 2006, according to the national police. Almost two a day. Only seven men put behind bars for murdering women last year. Witnesses to crimes threatened into silence, sometimes killed. Domestic abuse, still legal. Bodies buried alone, unnamed, without family, without prayers.\n \n Until you see a man, woman, child slipped into the ground without a headstone or an identity you have no idea how alone a body can be in this world. But here it was and here she was: all the violence, all the statistics and one kid. One kid, in perfect honesty, that I was almost afraid of -- her story so powerful that it threatened to overwhelm sheltered American me.\n \n I began interviewing her confidently enough in that small room in a women's center in the heart of Guatemala City, but soon I noticed my voice had become unrecognizably soft, motherly. I was all too aware I had abandoned my confident journalistic-authority voice for fear that she might shatter. Each of my questions -- Who did this to you? What prison did they take you to? How long did they keep you there? What did they do to you? Did you go to the police? -- pushed deeper into her still fresh pain. And yet -- and this was the most unnerving thing of all -- each of her replies came in that steady, flat voice of hers, as if she were the reporter and her subject were as dull as the weather:\n \n They took off my clothes. Held me down. And then they raped me. Ten of them. Then ten more. Then ten more.\n \n Do journalists comfort their subjects? I didn't remember that from my J-school courses. Do journalists get this nervous? I didn't remember my professors mentioning that either. Had I gone too far?\n \n I kept thinking each question was inappropriate, too personal. I told her she could walk away anytime. Say something off the record. Refuse to answer a question. I said these things early on, almost as a prayer. Maybe I was trying to get her to stop. For my own sanity, did I really want to know the answers to these questions? Maybe I also wanted to protect her from the media, from me. Did she know what she was doing? In the end, do sources ever really know what they are doing? And what was I anyway -- all these things were spinning in my head -- just a parachute journalist, jumping into the ashes of Guatemalan violence to bring out this jewel of a story -- the perfect example of one society's indifference to women?\n \n Whether warning her was the correct thing to do journalistically, it felt like the only thing to do humanly. She was risking her life speaking with me and I could offer her no protection other than her anonymity.\n \n In the end, she answered every question. Willingly. And she seemed to grow bolder with each statement.\n \n I want you to print this. Tell my story. Print it in Spanish so they will know I told.\n \n She was, of course, just one girl, one story amid hundreds, thousands. And certainly, impunity for rape and violence is not unique to Guatemala. It occurs in every country around the world. But she was the one sitting in front of me. And her story was no clich\u00e9: Kidnapped by armed men, she -- a petite 16-year old -- was taken to a notorious gang prison and raped for hours by dozens of inmates. \n \n (More)",

   "The methodical way she recited the details was terrifying: a description of the outfit she was wearing, her favorite; the pillow they put over her face to muffle her screams; the paper they tore out of her school book to smoke weed; her sore, scratched, bruised body; the two buses she took and the miles she walked to get home; the one guard she saw, only one, only on her way out.\n \n Her crime for this punishment? Growing up in a gang neighborhood. Being friendly with an inmate at the prison. Trusting him when she should not have. Being a lonely teenager who believed, na\u00efvely, that he would be satisfied just talking to her when she should have known he would want more. And when she did not want to give it, he had her kidnapped. He, and everyone else, would have her whether she wanted it or not.\n \n A story like this will inevitably be scrutinized. Called unbelievable. I needed things I felt certain she would not give me. I asked for the name of the man who had her kidnapped. She gave it to me. I asked if I could use her name in print. She gave me permission.\n \n Lawyers at the women's center are working on her case; her therapist gave me details of her weekly treatment; and she was given a physical examination at a hospital shortly after the attack. The prosecutor's office is supposed to be investigating, though not with any sense of urgency -- her primary rapist has been released from prison.\n \n Journalists, by definition, are people of privilege. We dip into the lives of our subjects and always leave them in the end. We ask perfect strangers to trust us with their most intimate, personal, embarrassing secrets. In return, they get their story told. To be in this line of work you must believe, almost religiously, that this is a fair trade.\n \n I can still see the two of us. Me: baggy jeans, clunky clogs, long-sleeved shirt. Her: loose, provocatively low-cut white top, tight jeans, and opened-toed black stilettos. It didn't make sense, but it didn't have to. It was a reversal of roles, her outfit a proverbial middle finger to the men who, she says, raped her. Mine, an attempt to avoid unwanted sexual attention.\n \n While I was impressed that she had the courage to speak to me, that same strength was evidence that this most recent trauma was just one of many she had suffered over the course of her short life. What was, to me, a litany of horrors was her daily reality.\n \n I do not regret my nervousness, my warnings, my shock, the tears I cried back in the safety of my hotel room. To this day, she remains more to me than just words on the page. She was my loss of innocence. My real education.\n \n Here are a few instant truths about journalism from a former neophyte: First, there are some sources you cannot treat with objectivity. Their vulnerability, their story, their plight, sets them apart from other sources. Second (surprise!), journalists are human. When someone tells about being raped, abused, or otherwise brutalized, their very real trauma and fear can be inadvertently transferred to you. It's like second-hand smoke: You don't have to smoke the cigarette to get the cancer. Lastly, as journalists, we will all one day be forced to leave someone behind. We have to move on to the next story. But in her case, it hurt.\n \n I left her behind three days later. Since I spoke with her, she has moved to a secret location. The threats have increased since her rapist's release. Personnel at the women's center who help her receive death threats. Fearing for her life, she has dropped the charges against the man who kidnapped and raped her. I have no idea what I did for her, but this is what she taught me: There is journalism school and then there is journalism. May we all strive for the latter.\n \n Meghann Farnsworth is a graduate student at UC Berkeley's School of Journalism.

It is true that in the Catholic Church women are second class citizens, however to accuse it of promoting or condoning rape is sheer nonsense. What are the motives behind these false accusations?\n\n Well, simone was the one making that accusation, so she can best answer. I don't think the Church does condone the violence. \n \n I personally have mixed views about the Catholic Church. I disagree with much of their approach on social issues - contraception, abortion, women's rights, gays, etc. I also thought that they handled the crisis of child molestation by priests very badly - protecting their own, keeping things secret to avoid embarrassing the Church, and trying to solve the problem by their own methods which were obviously not working. However, I think that most priests are honest and genuine and do care about people. Their philosophy may not be in line with the progressive trends of the last century but that does not make them malicious - just out of touch with most of Western society. They lack the influence in the West that they once had and most of their growth is in third world countries nowadays (which perpetuates their conservative stance). It will be interesting to see where the Church is in thirty years. My guess would be that they would have lost even more ground in the West and are largely a third world religion.\n \n I think that simone and others who have such reactions to the Church are extrapolating their anger at the Church's conservative stance on social issues and the problems associated with the priest's molestation scandal to say that the Church has lost all moral credibility and is even condoning things such as that rape scandal. I can understand the anger but think that that anger has eclipsed objective and logical analysis of what the Church is really about.",

I think attitudes towards things are a two way street, into and out of the church.\n\n This is an interesting point that you brought up and leads to the general question - how much are religions influenced by the societies in which they reside? It could be worth a thread in itself, but perhaps we could start some discussion here to see how much interest there is in the subject.\n \n The Catholic church seemed much different in its very earliest days as a persecuted sect than when it gained power after Constantine. I am sure that the power politics of the Church had a large influence on its dogma. I am sure that politics even played a role in choosing which of the original strands of Christianity became the official version after the Council of Nicea. Nowadays, in the West, the Church is faced with the fact that most people in the West do not accept the official Church doctrine. The Church in the US is much less conservative than the official Vatican stance and than the Church in more conservative countries, and is apparently criticized for it. The Catholicism that I grew up with in Massachusetts never addressed the social issues of abortion, contraception and gays. Even where women's roles were concerned, when the quote from the New Testament appeared of women having to obey their husbands, it was presented with a bit of humor since almost everyone in the audience was smirking and some even laughed a bit. \n \n Anyway, my main point is that the Church, as well as other religions, is affected by its surroundings and seems to absorb some of the social attitudes of the people practicing it - even if those social attitudes were not specifically inspired by religion but were part of the original culture. \n \n Other religions also show this influence. For example, Islam in Arab countries is different than that in North Africa and different still than the version in South Asia. I wonder about other religions such as Budhism, Judaism, etc.",

Secularism, the rapid urbanization of towns, drug trafficking and corruption, the culture of death and increasing violence, family instability and suffering of children, the poor, indigenous peoples, and finally the inculturation of the Gospel, are among the challenges the document pointed out. \n Latin America's bishops received the CAL's message and agreed with its conclusions. \"We must strongly counteract the influence and increasing expansion of the sects not only in my country but in the whole region\" said Bishop Luis Bambaren, secretary-general of the Peruvian bishops' conference. \n \n Likewise, Bishop Bismark Carballo of Nicaragua said, \"it is urgent to work with the families as Pope John Paul II (bio - news) urged us during his recent visit.\" \n \n Archbishop Norberto Rivera, Archbishop of Mexico City, also agreed with the Pontifical Commission for Latin America's document. \"It is necessary to work very hard to combat increasing violence in the region and also increasing corruption which only generates more violence.

Where homosexuality is still socially stigmatised, as in much of Africa, the local Anglican Church continues to anathematise gays.\n\n \n It goes both ways. It is absolutely irrational to think that society does not change and is un-effected by the lead of religion in major changes as well. It is probably less so that way today, but certainly throughout history religion had enormous effects on society. There are many examples of this, from Constantine's conversion to the great awakening revivals in colonial America. Your example the Protestant reformation is a perfect example of influences going both directions--the reformation (as part of religion) both fueled the enlightenment and was fueled by it.\n \n \nTo a non-religious person, one of religion's most striking characteristics - given its claim to be the repository of eternal truths - is its readiness to throw in the towel and change its mind when social circumstances render its previous position untenable. The year's 1600? You'd better believe the earth is the centre of the universe or we'll burn you alive. The year's 1700?

The only people I've ever heard complain about this sort of thing are athiests who use it as something to argue against religion. But in response, it is very important to distinguish between historically consistent fundamentals and \"fundamentals\" that aren't historically consistent throughout the history of Christianity. You have to remember, while geocentricity was surely believed in the early church (as in, before the year 1000), it is only later that we have evidence of it being considered fundamental dogma. Nowhere in the voluminous body of early church writings do we find anyone indicating any beliefs concerning stars and planets was to be fundamental dogma (other than the belief they were created, which is STILL a consistent belief today)--the heresies the early Christians were instead concerned with abstract matters about God and things like the trinity. In fact, in further support of this, Origen embraced science of his day and he was never chastised by the church at the time. Once again, we are back to the reality that spiritual issues and scientific issues are not the same. The church's taking a position of authoritativeness over scientists was something they gradually did over time (due to runaway political power), and abandoned, in time. The real rub with Galileo was that of not adhering to the authority of the church at the time. So the bottom line is that geocentricity as fundamental dogma is not consistent all along. Galileo just had the misfortune of being in a time where the church had too much political power and was in a phase where it considered geocentricity fundamental for some weird reason. As far as the REAL fundamentals of Christianity, you could not show me if you tried, where society has changed Christianity from, say, believing in the resurrection, or the incarnation. THAT would be religion truly being changed by society, because Christianity rises and falls on those issues. They are consistently fundamental throughout it's history.",

Many people would make good slaves.

Heck, try it in rednecksville at a conservative baptist church.\n \n Or, is this another situation athiest like to use to point out how religions conform to cultural acceptance?\n \n Of course, if you point out that churches were part of such liberation movements, I could also point out many points of fundamental doctrine in those churches where they defy scripture in part or whole and engaged in heresy. \n \n Anyone who's studied comparative religions and church histories will know that religious mores change to conform to society's desires.\n Scripture warned about this desire to have your ears tickled, but a simply lie reinforced over and over and finally given the stamp of approval by authority figures in the movement usually gets the changes passed.\n \n Look at the many calls for the Roman Catholic church to conform to desires and allow priests to marry and women to pastor. \n Look at the health-wealth prosperity cults that are growing and dominating the airwaves by leaps and bounds...founded in America, land of luxury and want. No longer is one to be meek and serve their lord piously and not crave material items, no, it's now doctrine that Jesus was filthy rich and he wants you to be too. NOW! Financial success is a sign of Gods blessings and if you aren't there yet, act like you are. Command those blessings into your life. You're in covenant with God, he HAS to do what you believe he said!\n \n And the sad thing is, even these current movements have changed over the past couple of decades...just as US culture has changed. \n \n Look at Catholicism again, and top pulpit pimps. Not many are willing to admit their beliefs boldly, that Christianity is the ONLY way to heaven. The Popes mild and accepting now giving forgiveness even when none is asked for. These attitudes didn't come from the top and trickle down. Rather the other way, sucked up from the roots.\n \n Why?\n Why such soft leadership?\n To keep the tithing flowing. Regardless of the fact that NT Christians aren't required to tithe but to give with a generous heart as they are lead and able to do...just follow the money. \n And you can only do that when the congregation is happy and actually in your building. if you aren't hearing what you want to hear in a particular church, you can often shop around. Many do.\n \n Seriously jyoshu, would you sit in a church building service after service if they, using the bible as they saw fit, taught something that didn't conform with your more liberal attitudes? Would you even consider contibuting your hard earned money to their cause to spread the message?",

If that's not evidence that these were events that were departures from the religion, I don't know what is. Even in your paradigm that religion is just a mental construct, these actions are still a departure from the religion.

   "Is it loving toward one's neighbor to enslave them? Because last time I checked, that was Christ's command for us--love each other. I see no reason to think that statement does not cover the issue of slavery. \n\n YES. It is Love to enslave another. More specifically, it's also love to be a slave of another.\n I don't know where you get these silly notions. Particularly since the book you read has many examples of this.\n For example, whites so loved their benighted and differnetly shaded brothers that they enslaved them so that they could ensure that their immortal souls would be ingrained with the ever present love of God. This was a task that took generations but, the proof is in the pudding. Most African Americans are devoutly 'christian' in the US. Pretty good and effective evangelicalism wouldn't you say? Wow, slavery having such a good end result. * ;) *\n How about the Love of the Jews God had when he turned them over to their enemies to be slaves for a time to teach them all a good lesson?\n The fact is, slavery was discussed in scripture, how one was to treat a slave and how a slave was to treat their human master. At every point, it was NEVER spoken out against directly or indirectly. There wasn't even a case of a sly pharasie trying to pull a fast one on the Christ. So, what you're doing is once again reinterpreting scripture which is expressly forbiden (according to scripture). Interjecting (eisegesis) your personal beliefs and experiences and forcing scripture to conform rather than the other way around.\n \n \nLook, you're always going to be able to find some issue out there the Bible doesn't condemn specifically by singling it out.\n\n Actually, this isn't like you think. For example, the triune nature of God is explained in scripture without stating 'Trinity'. Rules about NOT buggering one of the same sex are also defined yet not stated as 'don't participate in a homosexual act.' \n \n \nIf not, the Bible would be the longest work ever written. I can think of numerous things that are not right, and we know they are not right because of what Jesus taught, yet he didn't specify them in that many words. He never specifically said, for instance, that we shouldn't embezzle money. But we assume that's covered under the idea that stealing is wrong, just as we would assume slavery is covered under the idea of loving one's neighbor (other people). \n\n What the tax collectors were doing was a form of embezzlement (skimming off the taxes collected). Furthermore, we know embezzlement to be theft as it's taking something that doesn't belong to you. The Thou shall not covet's and steals pretty much cover this. Even Jesus told the tax collectors to stop it. Specifically.\n Stealing IS covered. Slavery IS too...with explicit commentary on how to treat them. You're stretching 'Love' to mean more than it really does.\n \"Love them as I would love You\", \"Love thy neighbor as you love thyself...as you love the Lord...As I have taught you.\"\n You can love someone and still enslave them. IF you only were capable of the Christ type love spoke of...rather than this man-made versions you and many so seem to be enamoured with.\n But, then again, I doubt you'd consider yourself a 'bondservant of Christ'.\n Are you a slave to righteousness? Does the yoke of your master rest comfortably upon your shoulders?\n \n \nA lot of times people read Paul's comments on slavery, and erroneously think he is condoning it. This is not true--he was simply addressing the issue of how slaves--Christian slaves--were to act under their masters. Re-read it sometime; you'll see what I'm talking about. No where does Paul say people may en-slave others. Context is everything.\n\n Yet, not a single urging to 'be free'. Does he extoll Christian masters to free their servants? Or for Christian slaves to flee their masters?\n \n \nI didn't say otherwise. I said it goes both ways. That is an agreement with your statement (and John Hanks') as well as adding on to it that it also goes the other direction too. For every example you can come up with of the church being influenced by society, I assure you I can come up with one about society being influenced by the church.\n\n \n Even if I were to agree with you on that, and for all we know there is truth in it, you still admit that the Church, religions, Christians, change their attitudes over generations, over time. This isn't really a single human growing into maturity in Christ as scripture speaks about but cultural and societial changes that they church (dragging it's feet or leading) eventually conforms to. Basically, the Church evolves over time and in that, eternal unchanging truth...isn't. What was true then isn't now. Regardless of what scripture calls for. And if all truth hasn't yet eroded, it stands to reason by observation that it's a matter of time.\n \n \n @JPSartre12,\n In my comments on marriage of the priesthood and women becoming priests, those are more recent calls. More often than not, those doing the calling rebel AWAY from the Church and form their own sects. Now, more are staying IN the Church and seeking to corrupt/change from within.\n Already Catholicism ALLOWS non priests to conduct services. Women are assisting more and more in Catholicism. All due to a lack of recruitment of new, young priests. Churches close constantly. Onder widowed men are becoming priest, even if they have children. An Anglican convert was recently allowed to be a priest...even though he was married *gasp* because he was married when he ministered an anglican church.\n \n The external forces are applying MASSIVE pressure to Catholicism to get it to change. The ignorant masses even accept counterfeit Charismatic gifts as legitimate and some engage in babbling thinking it's fro the Holy Spirit...all because of the persuasive nature of evangelical/pentecostal movements in the past few decades. \n Several months ago in the NE (Boston area) a group of gay rights protestors wore rainbow sashes (even had them on their children) and went to communion to protest from WITHIN the Church. Granted, the Papacy rejected the offerings of communion and offered a blessing instead but the point is, they operate from within to seek change.\n \n How about the Church sex abuse scandals. I'm constantly covering news on protestants who abuse children in their congregations yet, this is hardly dealt with on such a massive scale as with Catholics. How about teacher abuse? That happens far more often than by Catholic Priests yet, no massive movements against these groups or cries for restitution. And there IS coveverups by them. So, the cases are identical. \n \n In the end, the Church will change. Many will break off to form new sects and eventually, the Church will be different from it's current incarnation to the point of unrecognizability. Much like it is now from say 60 years ago when Vatican II changed the way Mass was held.\n \n Furthermore, not many are excommunicated anymore. There might still exist an implied excommunication like for divorce but it's seldom expressed let alone mentioned.\n \n \n As johnhanks was commenting on 'true christianity'.\n Nearly EVEY Christian of todays age will be considered a heretic who got it all wrong by their grandchildren's generation of new 'true believers'.",

   "YES. It is Love to enslave another.\n\n \n I'm not sure if this is supposed to be some vague statement about God and those who serve him or not, but frankly, I think you'd do well to just discuss this sort of thing straight-up, and forget the veiled statements. I for one am not interested in lofty, preachy statements; I'm interested in discussing the merits of the issue. Whatever you mean by that statement, it's not clear. And I doubt it's clear to too many people.\n \n \nI don't know where you get these silly notions. Particularly since the book you read has many examples of this.\n For example, whites so loved their benighted and differnetly shaded brothers that they enslaved them so that they could ensure that their immortal souls would be ingrained with the ever present love of God. \n\n \n This is (comparably) modern European and american history; not in the \"book.\" This doesn't address whether or not it was Christian to do so; it only reminds us of historical events, of which we all already know.\n \n \nHow about the Love of the Jews God had when he turned them over to their enemies to be slaves for a time to teach them all a good lesson?\n\n \n So you think this means Jesus condoned humans enslaving each other as a rule? Because that's the heart of Christianity--Christ. It's fascinating to me that every time someone wants to show God in a negative light, they completely ignore the words and actions of Christ and go straight to events of the Old Testament, as if nothing Christ ever said has any bearing on Christianity whatsoever. But the biggest hole in your example is that all it speaks to is what God would do Himself, NOT what he wants people to do. Just because God allows something bad to befall someone, doesn't mean people have a license by him to go and do likewise. God can give and take away all He wants -- He IS God, after all. We are not God, and can't do that. \n \n \nSo, what you're doing is once again reinterpreting scripture which is expressly forbiden (according to scripture). Interjecting (eisegesis) your personal beliefs and experiences and forcing scripture to conform rather than the other way around.\n\n \n I don't think loving one's neighbor is forcing scripture to anything. It's not like Jesus was vague when He said do unto others as you would have them do unto you. There's no way to interpret that any other way than what it says. Therefore, slavery is bad to do to others.\n \n \nWhat the tax collectors were doing was a form of embezzlement (skimming off the taxes collected). Furthermore, we know embezzlement to be theft as it's taking something that doesn't belong to you. The Thou shall not covet's and steals pretty much cover this. Even Jesus told the tax collectors to stop it. Specifically.\n Stealing IS covered. Slavery IS too...with explicit commentary on how to treat them. You're stretching 'Love' to mean more than it really does.\n \"Love them as I would love You\"\n\n \n Yes, that's why I said embezzlement is covered under the 'stealing' thing, and it is. Slavery falls under the way people are to treat one another, and that's where Christ talks about people showing love to one another. You're making this way too complicated than it actually is.\n \n \nYou can love someone and still enslave them. IF you only were capable of the Christ type love spoke of...rather than this man-made versions you and many so seem to be enamoured with.\n\n \n This is getting a bit ridiculous on your part. No one is capable of the sort of love Christ demonstrates, so it's a moot point. Slavery is bad. Accept that, because it's true. You're speaking out of both sides of your mouth at this point.\n \n \nBut, then again, I doubt you'd consider yourself a 'bondservant of Christ'. Are you a slave to righteousness? Does the yoke of your master rest comfortably upon your shoulders?\n\n \n An even more outlandish point on your part. Now you are conflating a spiritual principle with physical slavery, in a case where the two have no business being conflated. Someone WILLINGLY serving Christ has no bearing on the issue of whether it is right or wrong to force physical slavery on other people. \n \n \nYet, not a single urging to 'be free'. Does he extoll Christian masters to free their servants? Or for Christian slaves to flee their masters?\n\n \n This is probably the best point you've made here, and I'll grant you this one. He does not tell the masters to free their slaves, that I know of. But that still does not equate to slavery being condoned in the NT (as in \"slavery is ok!\") We do not base what we know of God on what the Bible does NOT say. Again, the Bible you seem to demand would have to comprise many, many volumes--the longest work ever written.\n \n \nEven if I were to agree with you on that, and for all we know there is truth in it, you still admit that the Church, religions, Christians, change their attitudes over generations, over time. \n\n \n Of course! No one is saying otherwise.\n \n \n Basically, the Church evolves over time and in that, eternal unchanging truth...isn't. What was true then isn't now. Regardless of what scripture calls for. And if all truth hasn't yet eroded, it stands to reason by observation that it's a matter of time.\n\n \n Well I can't go that far with you. The problem with that statement is that it doesn't take into account the fact that it depends on the issue. The central tenets of Christianity--the ones that really matter and that have been consistent all along--have simply not changed. That's a fact. There's no way around that for you. Christians today believe Christ rose from the dead just as they did in the first century, as we see in Paul's letters. Christians today believe that Jesus was God in the flesh, just as they believed from the get-go--in the NT testament writings. So as you can see, things that were true then are STILL true now, in the views of Christians. The beliefs professed in, say, the Apostle's Creed have been the same from the beginning. They were held to then, and they are held to now. There is a reason that belief in, for example, geocentricity is not in the creeds--the reason is that it was not meant to be critical issue, so it doesn't matter than the church doesn't hold to geocentricity anymore. So again, it depends on the issue.",

   "Oh come now. Do you really not think there are many, many examples of the church (or religion, if you prefer a more general term) having a profound impact on society?\n\n Yes. I really think that. And I think if I ask you you get into double figures with examples of ways in which changes in religious thinking altered the whole tenor of society's behaviour, you will be struggling. Go for it.\n \nWell, ANY religious person (and some not-religious) is going to view religion has having an objective existence outside of peoples' minds. So basically the reason you believe I cannot supply such examples is that any such example (in your thinking) is really not religion to begin with, because religion doesn't really exist--it's just something people made up. It's not really and truly religion ... I'm pretty sure there's a fallacy in there somewhere on your part; prob. no-true-scottsman.\n\n This would be a valid objection if I had pre-defined conditions for the demonstration. I have nowhere suggested that 'any such example ... is really not religion to begin with', nor have I laid down any other conditions.\n \nRe. #2, the obvious evidence is that the religion teaches something other and opposite of what happened with the crusades and burning people at the stake. If that's not evidence that these were events that were departures from the religion, I don't know what is.\n\n Then, with respect, you don't know what is. You say 'the religion' teaches something other; this assumes as its premise the very conclusion you are trying to demonstrate - that 'the religion' has an existence outside the heads of its current practitioners. It is a classic case of begging the question.

Which to me make much more sense. (It has nothing to do with anything supernatural--it has to do with the fact that a given ideology ceases to become that when the ideology is no longer followed.) If a group of Christians takes on enough changes that there is basically nothing left to identify them as Christian, and maybe even change to the beliefs of another religion due to outside influences, there's no point in calling them \"Christian\". If the followers of Confucius stop adhering to any sayings of Confucius and follow other views instead, there's no point in calling them followers of Confucius. It seems to me that most any ideology works this way ... why would you call someone a Stalinist if they go against views of Stalin? Why would you call someone a Jeffersonian Democrat if their political views run opposite of what Jefferson espoused?",

   "So now it has to be ten or more, eh?\n\n Well, you did say\n \nFor every example you can come up with of the church being influenced by society, I assure you I can come up with one about society being influenced by the church\n\n and I'm pretty sure i'd have no difficulty getting onto double figures with the former. However, I agree that trading examples for the next umpteen posts would be pointless.\n \nThe problem here is that you apparently view religious systems as based on what the followers hold to at the present\n\n Apparently? I said I did - except that I referred to religions, not 'religious systems' (whatever they are).\n \n...even if it no longer resembles the religion that the founders intended, while I view religious systems as being based on what the founders of the religions laid down\n\n Again, our perspectives diverge here. I see religion as an evolving phenomenon, rather than something founded from scratch at a given point in time. Yes, some time between 0 and 50 CE Christianity emerged as a distinct cult, and yes, the cult had founders; but it still emerged from judaism, rather than being something created out of nothing. Lots of messianic offshoots of Judaism flourished at that time: by historical accident, Christianity has persisted.\n \n This is a difficult point to get across, but what I'm trying to say is that you see the founding of Christianity as the 'year 0' of a wholly new phenomenon, with the beliefs held by the people who then called themselves Christians brand new, pristine and inviolable. From my perspective those beliefs were those people's modifications and re-interpretations of what had gone before: first century christianity was the beliefs and practices of first century christians. Fourth century christianity was the beliefs and practices of fourth century christians, and differed in a variety of ways; and so on.\n \nIf a group of Christians takes on enough changes that there is basically nothing left to identify them as Christian, and maybe even change to the beliefs of another religion due to outside influences, there's no point in calling them \"Christian\".\n\n Agreed, and one could argue that this is precisely what has happened with Mormonism. But if a group of people identify themselves as Christians on the grounds that they believe in the divinity and authority of Jesus, then as long as that core persists in name the ancillary beliefs that go with it are freely interchangeable.\n \n You were keen in your post to discount the importance of anything supernatural in this debate; I on the other hand think it's a key issue. If the beliefs and practices of first century christians were indeed divinely mandated, then of course later deviations are just that - departures from pristine and inviolable principles. Without the supernatural mandate, they were just the practices most expedient and appealing to those people at that time, and as open to later modification and re-interpretation as any others.",

The authority of Jesus said nothing of conquering other lands, and subjecting their peoples. I seen nothing wrong with, instead of just taking someone at their word that they're followers of a religion's founder, actually seeing if they are. It's not hard to verify when we have the teachings of the founders (or at least those subscribed to them).\n \n Your point about religions evolving is interesting, and I could agree with that on some non-essential issues, at least to the point of the ebb and flow of any ideology over time. But now that I think about it, I'd say religion is even more shielded against evolution than most ideologies, in part because it is often based on ancient but concrete texts, and because there are often \"orthodox\" tenets that are considered critical to have in place to maintain it being called that particular religion (as in the case of Christianity).

   "But why would you want to live a lie like that?\n\n \n Lie?\n \n Alternate truth! ;)\n \n Actually it could be an effective retirement plan. Spend a few years reciting platitudes, retire and be taken care off modestly. Or do you really think they kick old priests out in the streets?\n \n Personally, if I were to really live something totally off the wall, I'd go Pentecostalist.\n I hear their hundred dollar handshakes are divine.\n \n 1) Don't need seminary classes worth a darn, just hook up with another pimp and do some kickbacks for him. Then call yourself an apostle and him a Bishop. He'll reinforce that you're an apostle since you're doing the same to him. \n \n 2) Claim special annointings to do magical things that you need no proof of ever happening.\n \n 3) Use your pathetic powers, erm...I mean prophetic powers, to reinterpret the bible anyway you want it to mean. Never worry about being questioned by the masses because successive generarions of brain washed congregants will defend you. Threaten all who disobey that unless they are properly under your special anointing, that bad things will happen to them. Carefully recite 'Touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm' over and over. Always claim that criticism of your heretical ways is just proof that you're being persecuted by the anti-Christ.\n \n 4) Rape whomever you want...I mean, cast out the demons of lust using your very unique and holy spirit approved methods or replacing carnality with Christ-like love.\n \n 5) Learn how to sing and step. A good profit maker knows how to glide and is glib. When at a loss for words, gibber jabber in tongues. Shebottaty, shebottaboty, shebottahiundy! Just remember to mention Jesus once in a while. Usually a formula of 1 Jesus to 100 \"I's\" to 20-30 Holy Spirits and an occasional Gawd works. The really good ones can go an entire sermon without once mentioning Jesus or God. Remember, you're a Spirit church. \n \n 6) Ignore any scripture that doesn't conform to your agenda. Jesus rode about on the back of an XXX when he entered Jerusalem, that's the Cadillac of those times (ignore that it was borrowed). That justifies your Beemer and Hummer. Jesus said 'come to my house' That means he had a mansion large enough to hold hundreds just like you do. Jesus unseemed garment (his nappy) was a special robe made of unparallelled skill. That justifies your tailored Italian suits. Remember to inform the congregants that they too are promissed financial rewards. It's seed and harvest. That if they followed your lead, they could reap their harvest like you have. 100 fold returns are promised in the bible. Ignore that all of your funds come from taking their finacial seed for yourself and you don't practice what you preach. We're not preaching to well centered and emotionally stable people, that's not the market. We want the ones who believe everything and tend to own more self help books than anything else.\n \n 7) Hire PR people and strategist to assist you in your presentation. Learn some elements of neuro-linguistics. Don't waste your resources on things that won't work. Let professionals help you. It really IS cost effective.\n \n 8) Remember, you're doing Gods work. No blessing you have is too small. Your cup should runneth over. Modesty is for chumps.\n \n Jesus he loves you and he knows you're right.\n You've been talking to him all your life.\n \n 9) Never forget your Damascus road experience. The more outlandish the better. Typically, the ones most oft heard are You were a rock and roller, a drug user, a womanizer and a con man, until one day, when on a bad trip from tainted drugs, you were struck down by Jesus who personally delivers a special message for you. He also regularly checks up on you to give his stamp of approval and new, more out rageous, plans.\n Now, you're a rocker for Jesus, the only drug you need is supplied by the Holy Spirit, you're wife is the ONLY woman for you (even if it's a 3rd marriage)!\n \n 10) Ensure your family is well entrenched in your Church leadership. Don't let anyone run any aspect of your church without micro managing them. When you can be guaranteed to 100% loyalty, plant seed churches under your anointing with hand picked pastors who know how to do a decent kickback and set you up for visits where you can get love offerings 3-4 times a year.\n \n 11) To honor and bless ALWAYS means 1st and foremost financial gifts. If the congregation wants to honor their man of Gawd, they best fork up the dough. Make them feel bad if they don't.\n \n 12) Sell anything not nailed down for more than it's worth...it's been blessed by you. Write crappy books that are mostly plagerized and sell them all the world over.\n \n 13) No matter what, always try to be fresh and new...that's what the market wants. If the only band wagon isn't working, jump on the next. Always dismiss, theology, doctrine and religion. Be down right ignorant about it and claim that anyone who wants to waste their time with that stuff are dry bones and nay saying Gawds divine plans.\n \n \n Because, in the end,\n \n \"We are building a religion\n We are building it bigger\n We are widening the corridors\n And adding more lanes\n \n We are building a religion\n A limited edition\n We are now accepting callers\n for these pendant key chains\n \n To resist it is useless\n It is useless to resist it\n ...\"\n \n And, if all goes well, in a few years, you too can have your own mega church with a revolving door for the oranges.\n \n Squeeze them baby...squeeze them!\n \n \n And for my detractors,\n \"Hassen Sie so den Lord, dem Sie gekommen sind, mich zu verfolgen?\"\n \n Use your magical powers of interpretation of tongues to figure that one out.

   "Other texts that earlier and different sects had used and regarded as equally enlightening were discarded or proscribed: the religion was being adapted to fit the intellectual conditions of the age.\n\n \n As well as the conditions of the founders of the religion. That's the important point here. They did it because they wanted to keep the religion pure to it's original teachings. (we know this, because we HAVE those teachings.) That's why, when it's all said and done here, this example is one of relgion staying true to it's origins rather than evolving into something else.\n \n \nJyoshu, I'd hate to think I was causing you distress. Chill, man.\n\n \n It's really not that bad. :) \n \n \nNow that is interesting, because I would have said exactly the same about you. In my case I'm thinking of pre-Christian history, and am looking at Christianity not as a 'year 0' departure launched ab initio but as an 'evolutionary' offshoot of Judaism. In that context, its founding texts are re-interpretations of pre-existing concepts rather than things created pristine and new.\n\n \n But even if that's the case, it's not called \"Judaism\" anymore, now is it? It's called something different. But your logic seems to be advocating we call something that's not Christian as \"Christian\" even if it goes against the religion's founders. I could go along with your idea that Crusades-style Christianity might be an evolution into something different if you were willing to simply not conflate it with the real thing, and acknowledge the key differences. What you are doing is more like saying Christianity and Judaism are really the same thing, while your example indicates that you know they are different.\n \n \nWas it really? Individual dissenters aside, has there ever been a time when the unified voice of a nation's Christians has wholly condemned that nation's involvement in warfare? Or has it more often been the case that the Church has been wheeled out to bless our brave troops' noble mission to destroy the evil foe?\n\n \n Well, the fact that the Vatican has condemned war many times in modern history, including the conflict in Iraq, and released statements hoping to see war averted, I'd say that fact alone shows you are wrong.\n \n \nI assure you, I am trying to take into account the whole of history. I mentioned the Crusades only as an example; I could equally well have mentioned the Church's blessing of the Conquistadores.\n\n \n But that example (from the 1400s and 1500s) is still from pretty much the same era. There is a period of history from around the 11th to the 16th century (about 500 years) where the church was really into holy war, so IMO this mostly a phase in it's history, and it is now more along the lines of the way it was very early on. It can be argued that some of it, particularly early on, was defensive in nature. (The crusades were in large part a response to force-based spread of Islam that had been happening for several hundred years up to that point. As others have pointed out in these forums, it is very possible that if the Crusades did not happen, Europe would be under Islamic regimes and theocracies today much like many countries of the ME.)",

Sign Up Now!\n Charitable Giving Increases Dramatically\n Giving USA, the yearbook of philanthropy, estimates Americans gave total contributions of $260.28 billion for 2005, a growth of 6.1 percent (2.7 percent adjusted for inflation). \n Unprecedented Giving to Domestic and Foreign Disasters\n The year 2005 saw extraordinary philanthropic response to three major natural disasters. About half of the $15 billion increase in total giving from the revised estimate of $245.22 billion in 2004 is attributable to disaster relief giving. The other half reflects donors' commitments to other causes that matter to them. \n \n Major natural disasters in the U.S. and abroad between December 2004 and October 2005 generated at least $7.37 billion in contributions (2.8 percent of total estimated giving) in 2005. \n \n Of the disaster giving, individuals contributed an estimated $5.83 billion, or 79 percent of the estimated total in disaster relief contributions for 2005. \n \n Corporations gave an estimated $1.38 billion, or 19 percent of the estimated total of disaster relief gifts. The balance of disaster relief giving, an estimated $160 million ($0.16 billion) based on records from the Foundation Center, was paid by foundations in 2005, for 2 percent of the estimated amount for disaster relief. \n \n \"Disaster relief certainly played a role in 2005,\" said Richard T. Jolly, chair of the Giving USA Foundation. \"Relief contributions are estimated to be roughly 3 percent of the total. An additional $253 billion in gifts supported more than 1.4 million charities including religious congregations, schools, clinics, arts groups, food banks, and more.\" \n \n Individuals Account for Bulk of Giving\n Giving USA reports giving from four sources of contributions-individual (living) donors; bequests by deceased individuals; foundations; and corporations. \n \n Individual giving is always the largest single source of donations. It rose by 6.4 percent. (2.9 percent adjusted for inflation) to an estimated $199.07 billion. It accounts for 76.5 percent of all estimated giving in 2005. \n http://nonprofit.about.com/od/trendsissuesstatistics/a/givingusa2005.htm\n \n\n \n \n\n Who Gives and Who Doesn't?\n By JOHN STOSSEL and KRISTINA KENDALL\n \n Nov. 28, 2006 - There are a million ways to give to charity. Toy drives, food drives, school supply drives...telethons, walkathons, and dance-athons. \n \n But just who is doing the giving? Three quarters of American families donate to charity, giving $1,800 each, on average. Of course, if three quarters give, that means that one quarter don't give at all. So what distinguishes those who give from those who don't? It turns out there are many myths about that.\n ....\n The Church Connection \n Finally, the single biggest predictor of whether someone will be charitable is their religious participation.\n \n Religious people are more likely to give to charity, and when they give, they give more money: four times as much. And Arthur Brooks told me that giving goes beyond their own religious organization:\n \n \"Actually, the truth is that they're giving to more than their churches,\" he says. \"The religious Americans are more likely to give to every kind of cause and charity, including explicitly non-religious charities.\"\n And almost all of the people who gave to our bell ringers in San Francisco and Sioux Falls said they were religious or spiritual. \n \n\n \n \n\n After the Asian Tsunami two years ago, the U.S. government pledged $900 million to tsunami relief. American individuals donated $2 billion -- three times what government gave -- in food, clothing, and cash. Private charities could barely keep up with the donations. \n ...\n Americans' preference for voluntary contributions over forced giving through government is one way in which Americans differ from other people. (Don't think it's forced? See what happens if you don't pay your taxes.)\n \n Syracuse University professor Arthur Brooks's new book, \"Who Really Cares\", points out that Americans give more than the citizens of any other country. Individually, Americans give seven times more money than people in Germany and 14 times more than Italians give. We also volunteer more.\n http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2682730&page=1 \n\n \n \n\n People who are religious give more across the board to all causes than their non-religious counterparts\n \n There is a huge \"charity gap\" that follows religion: On average, religious people are far more generous than secularists with their time and money. This is not just because of giving to churches-religious people are more generous than secularists towards explicitly non-religious charities as well. They are also more generous in informal ways, such as giving money to family members, and behaving honestly.\n http://www.arthurbrooks.net/statistics.html\n \n",

   "Individual giving is always the largest single source of donations. It rose by 6.4 percent. (2.9 percent adjusted for inflation) to an estimated $199.07 billion. It accounts for 76.5 percent of all estimated giving in 2005. \n http://nonprofit.about.com/od/trends...ingusa2005.htm\n\n There would be two questions I would have about this amount of US charity (which would amount to $199 billion / 300 million ~ $670 per person - more per family).\n 1) How is this distributed (percentage wise) by wealth? For example, Bill gates has earned billions and is now giving billions away. I believe he is giving more money away each year than he brings in. Add up enough of these philanthropic billionaires and high millionaires and you might have the great majority of the giving. Though the AVERAGE contribution might be $670, what is the MEDIAN contribution?

You'll also not that in in some circumstances, charitable giving is artifically inflated due to somewhat selfish reasons. Say post Katrina or 911. I'm sure a spike ensured in US giving (to each other) rather than when a disaster occurs over seas (where we have to give to someone outside our sphere).\n \n But, in conclusion, I lay claim to any organization that has 1+ athiest in it, isn't 100% Religious driven or collects tax funds as a secular (irreligious, non-religious, atjhiestic (since they aren't actually worshiping anything)) organization.",

   "You put a lot of importance on names. Whatever it's called, it's an offshoot of Judaism, not something created ex nihilo - in much the same way Mormonism is an offshoot of Christianity, no matter what you call it.\n\n \n I never said that religion doesn't evolve sometimes into other religions. I'm not saying they don't evolve, I'm saying that it's not that simple--you have to take the issues into consideration. Christianity right now still holds the tenets it did (I'm talking about the fundamentals) very early on. We know this because of what we read in early writings. Yes, Christianity has evolved some, in terms of style mostly. For example, a worship service in the 1st and 2nd century would seem probably seem quite foreign to modern Christian worshippers. But the beliefs were largely the same. When the fundamentals change, it becomes a new religion (e.g. Mormonism).\n \n \nI call the whole branching tree Judaeochristianity, and see it as an excellent illustration of the way religions adapt to fit changes in society. There was no Mary-veneration in the early church, but when Christianity spread to agricultural societies accustomed to worshipping mother-goddesses it evolved seamlessly into Marian Catholicism. (By your previous logic, since Mary-veneration was not countenanced by the church's founders, you will presumably deny that Marian Catholics are Christians.)\n\n \n No, I'd see it as an extraneous belief, and if their core beliefs about Christ are still there, I'd still view them as Christians.\n \n To be honest, I think we've both pretty much hit the \"brick wall\" stage in this discussion, so I'm going to bow out of this one.",

   "Perhaps you could try something new and back that up with some actual cited data from a source. Because frankly, I see a lot of rhetoric and opinion against Christians in your posts, but nothing to back up your assertions. In fact I don't think I've seen you cite anything yet; just a big 'ol axe to grind. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n From the post you quote,\n \n \n\n But seriously, I do question why the defensive nature of your posts. Is it because my statements are true? Check out MinistryWatch for a believers stance on which ministries are on the up and up and which ones are most likely on the take. \n\n \n Sorry I didn't put the .org or link it.\n \n Lets check out a 100 mil ministry, Joyce Meyer's Ministry. \n She was one covered on 20/20 a few weeks back.\n My favorite site, www.PulpitPimps.org has a recent article on the show, with a Youtube.com link to the show covered.\n She was mentioned at a United Pentecostal (http://www.greaterfaithchurch.org/) service I attended 3 weeks ago where it was mentioned by a visiting Evangelist that her cancer was back and she needed praying for. She's Word of Faith of the Prosperity persuasion, she doesn't recite the healings for all and if you t'ain't 100% healthy then God'sa cursin' you! That her fellow WofF's seem to push. But, it's a disjointed movement and like you J., you can make it up as you go along. Here's her site. http://www.joycemeyer.org/ Of note, I entered the word 'charity' in the search engine on her site...no results. *shrug*\n \n Now, what does MinistryWatch.org (aka WallWatchers) have to say about her,\n \nMotivational, Plain-speaking Teacher Doing Charitable Work\n Joyce Meyer Ministries (JMM), most recently known as Enjoying Every Day Life and formally known as Life in the Word, is primarily a motivational teaching organization featuring Joyce Meyer. JMM, however, also engages in a variety of charitable and humanitarian efforts. JMM is legally structured as a church, but cannot be considered a traditional congregational church as its congregation is reached only via the media. Meyer motivates and teaches on primarily emotional healing and related subjects through daily media outreach such as television and radio programs, along with tapes, videos, books and conferences. \n \n Meyer is a prolific writer with more than 70 books to her credit, and has lectured widely on numerous subjects from the broad issues of Christian living, personal development, how to prosper, healing, eating habits and the Bible. A self-described victim of sexual and emotional abuse, Meyer appeals to the hurting of all age groups in society and the church at large with a message of healing and restoration and a promise of hope for realization of \"personal destiny\" within the will of God. \n \n Meyer's theology has evolved over time, starting with a clear biblical basis with Charismatic leanings, moving on to embrace elements of the Word of Faith movement and, more recently, has begun to water down direct connections to biblical truth in an attempt to appeal to a more widespread audience (as indicated by the ministry's name change). Additionally, the ministry has also evolved over time into a variety of far-flung charitable efforts that seem to lack a strategic focus and, at times, have appeared opportunistic. For example, JMM has begun its own U.S. relief and development efforts in response to hurricane Katrina and Rita rather than choosing to steer their donors to the more established organizations that have the scale and infrastructure to respond quickly and effectively to such disasters. Meyer's has stated that money raised for the victims of these storm is mostly being routed to other organizations, so the question naturally arises as to why JMM would choose to raise money through JMM versus just encouraging donors to give directly to the relief ministries that JMM planned to give the money to anyway? In addition, one of the organizations JMM is supporting in this effort, PRC Compassion, is itself a new entity, which may not be as effective as other Christian ministries that are more established and experienced in the field of disaster relief. \n \n Charitable Efforts At Home\n JMM's St. Louis Dream Center offers food, clothing, and a place of worship to the homeless, prostitutes and disenfranchised of St. Louis. Trained staff and volunteers minister the Gospel to street people and in the nursing homes of the St. Louis area. JMM in late 2002 discontinued its Rage Against Destruction youth ministry. JMM also donates large amounts of its donor's funds to other ministries. In a recent disclosure, the ministry also indicated that it donated $27 million, roughly one-fourth of its total revenues, to a wide variety of other ministries. These donations indicate a giving spirit at JMM but also raise questions about whether it is appropriate for money donated to JMM to be used to support other ministries. As an operating ministry, versus a charitable foundation, it is odd that JMM would pursue such extensive giving to other ministries as part of its normal operations. Furthermore, many of the ministries JMM supports could easily be supported by JMM donors directly, if they chose to do so, thereby avoiding having their gifts incur the overhead expenses of two ministries rather than just one. \n \n Etc.\n\n \n And a CHRISTIAN watch dog group ranks her a C for transparancy. An improvement from previous reports. \n \n www.give.org has this to say,\n \nhttp://charityreports.give.org/Public/Report.aspx?CharityID=3113\n JMM distributes religious teachings worldwide on audio and video, and books authored by Joyce Meyer in 63 languages. JMM's ministry website is a source of information for those who want to learn more about the ministry or access JMM's monthly magazine. JMM's conferences minister to over 250,000 people in U.S. cities annually. Also, JMM has a telecast called Enjoying Everyday Life that is seen worldwide.\n \n For the year ended December 31, 2005, JMM's program expenses were: \n \n Missions and outreach 33,093,139 \n Television ministry 28,135,217 \n Meetings and conferences 10,673,429 \n Print media 9,941,624 \n Radio ministry 2,313,324 \n \n Total Program Expenses: $84,156,733 \n\n Note, of that 33 million out of 110 brought in, it's listed for ministries and outreach. Meaning she lumps sowing into other ministries with programs. \n \n Now, what some don't seem to easily grasp is the pass the buck around mentality that these pimps have. It's a 'I give you 30 million to make you look good and you kick it back to me.' Furthermore, most of the ministries are in her name, the name of a family member, or the name of a cohort she set up or of one who set her up. \n \n How about christianaggression.org comments on her,\n \nhttp://christianaggression.org/item_display.php?type=NEWS&id=1163176850\n Their annual report for last year says that for every dollar received in donations - and it was somewhere in the region of \u00a340 million - 83 per cent went on \"outreach and programmes directed at reaching people with the Gospel of Jesus Christ\".\n \n In 2005 they opened 22 orphanages in India, and operate more than 40 children's homes throughout Asia. They earmarked money for \"outreach\" projects for the Asian Tsunami and the Hurricane Katrina disasters.\n \n She was even able, in her 2005 report, to nail down exactly how many \"documented salvations\" they had been responsible for last year - 34,028\n\n Wow, now she's counting expenses of raising the money as well as keeping her show running, her under paid employees paid and her lavish life style (fully supported by her ministry) as part of her outreach program.\n While some good was done in the humanitarian efforts, if you note in the MinisteryWatch article, her donations for Hurricane relief were passed on to other charities...who no doubtedly claimed it as part of their funds raised.\n \n If you care to follow how this works, Sarte, you end up getting a pretty bloated figure on how much money is reportedly raised and how much is actually raised.\n I raise 100 dollars, report that and then pass it on to a charity who reports that as funds raised, unless the send it directly to those who it's raised for, we repeat the process. Except at each stage, some is syphoned off as part of the expenses needed to raise funds. After a while, the money gets hard to trace and you can end up with reports of millions and billions raised...yet oddly, not much ends up in the hands of those it's raised for.\n I briefly worked for fund raisers. We kept ~80% for fundraising expenses before passing on the rest to a charitable organization. emoticon_xangel \n \n I believe Christianity Today had an article http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2004/januaryweb-only/1-19-13.0.html dealing with how Meyer is shuffling her funds around.\n \n On a somewhat related note, when she recently sold her 3 adjoining homes (hers and her kids) she did so at a hefty profit.\n \n Jyousha, it's NOT anti-Christian, although there is some trickle down, it's anti-evangelist and the multitudes who misrepresent the faith you claim to follow, which by scripture is everyone.\n \n In conclusion, it's not Meyer's pimping her followers for cash that will damn her, it's her false doctrine.\n She's a JDS, Jesus Died Spiritually believer.\n The salvation and sacrifice on the cross doesn't cut it, Jesus had to go to hell and suffer at the hands of Satan for your salvation. This, of course is non scriptual or a gross distortion at best of the Word.\n \n Now, when we debate scripture, please cite chapter and verse for me. If you know much of anything of your bible, you'll note that many comments I make from time to time are verse from the bible. Only occasionally when I do do I cite book, chapter and verse.",

In another sermon, he defined what honoring your man of gawd is about. \"It's financial...it can be other things too, but when they talk about honoring in the bible, it was about gifts.\"\n \n So, if his mission trip isn't personally profitable, he won't revisit. Not cost effective.\n \n So, are these types of people 'Christian'? They claim to be. They have many, MANY followers who say they are.

Our government's programs are representative of its population's desires.\n \n \n But, in conclusion, I lay claim to any organization that has 1+ athiest in it, isn't 100% Religious driven or collects tax funds as a secular (irreligious, non-religious, atjhiestic (since they aren't actually worshiping anything)) organization.\n\n Show me where I said that any charitable organization was 100% Christian. Your strawman arguments keep catching fire. Perhaps it's from the fires of damnation? emoticon_rolleyes",

   "From the post you quote,\n \n \n \n Sorry I didn't put the .org or link it.\n \n Lets check out a 100 mil ministry, Joyce Meyer's Ministry. \n She was one covered on 20/20 a few weeks back.\n My favorite site, www.PulpitPimps.org has a recent article on the show, with a Youtube.com link to the show covered.\n She was mentioned at a United Pentecostal (http://www.greaterfaithchurch.org/) service I attended 3 weeks ago where it was mentioned by a visiting Evangelist that her cancer was back and she needed praying for. She's Word of Faith of the Prosperity persuasion, she doesn't recite the healings for all and if you t'ain't 100% healthy then God'sa cursin' you! That her fellow WofF's seem to push. But, it's a disjointed movement and like you J., you can make it up as you go along. Here's her site. http://www.joycemeyer.org/ Of note, I entered the word 'charity' in the search engine on her site...no results. *shrug*\n \n Now, what does MinistryWatch.org (aka WallWatchers) have to say about her,\n \n \n And a CHRISTIAN watch dog group ranks her a C for transparancy. An improvement from previous reports. \n \n www.give.org has this to say,\n \n Note, of that 33 million out of 110 brought in, it's listed for ministries and outreach. Meaning she lumps sowing into other ministries with programs. \n \n Now, what some don't seem to easily grasp is the pass the buck around mentality that these pimps have. It's a 'I give you 30 million to make you look good and you kick it back to me.' Furthermore, most of the ministries are in her name, the name of a family member, or the name of a cohort she set up or of one who set her up. \n \n How about christianaggression.org comments on her,\n \n Wow, now she's counting expenses of raising the money as well as keeping her show running, her under paid employees paid and her lavish life style (fully supported by her ministry) as part of her outreach program.\n While some good was done in the humanitarian efforts, if you note in the MinisteryWatch article, her donations for Hurricane relief were passed on to other charities...who no doubtedly claimed it as part of their funds raised.\n \n If you care to follow how this works, Sarte, you end up getting a pretty bloated figure on how much money is reportedly raised and how much is actually raised.\n I raise 100 dollars, report that and then pass it on to a charity who reports that as funds raised, unless the send it directly to those who it's raised for, we repeat the process. Except at each stage, some is syphoned off as part of the expenses needed to raise funds. After a while, the money gets hard to trace and you can end up with reports of millions and billions raised...yet oddly, not much ends up in the hands of those it's raised for.\n I briefly worked for fund raisers. We kept ~80% for fundraising expenses before passing on the rest to a charitable organization. emoticon_xangel \n \n I believe Christianity Today had an article http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2004/januaryweb-only/1-19-13.0.html dealing with how Meyer is shuffling her funds around.\n \n On a somewhat related note, when she recently sold her 3 adjoining homes (hers and her kids) she did so at a hefty profit.\n \n Jyousha, it's NOT anti-Christian, although there is some trickle down, it's anti-evangelist and the multitudes who misrepresent the faith you claim to follow, which by scripture is everyone.\n \n In conclusion, it's not Meyer's pimping her followers for cash that will damn her, it's her false doctrine.\n She's a JDS, Jesus Died Spiritually believer.\n The salvation and sacrifice on the cross doesn't cut it, Jesus had to go to hell and suffer at the hands of Satan for your salvation. This, of course is non scriptual or a gross distortion at best of the Word.\n\n \n Ok, that's one person and one church. (Wait, actually that's really not even a church!) What else ya got? Because your assertion was that \"the mega churches leading the current wave of evangelism\" give far less than 10% to the poor. You have a long ways to go! emoticon_xangel",

   "Run and funded by Christians for the most part.\n\n Says who? What constitues a 'christian'? \n I'm one. I live in a christian country. I know far more about scriptures than most here as well as personally familiar with nearly ever sect and denomination of them. \n Furthermore, I've given depositions under oath in regards to religious issues. The opposing lawyer wanted to see if I knew about 'christianity' or simply a particular sect. Try that without Google or a handy bible.\n \n Furthermore, it's not funded through Christian charity. The government TAKES taxes from all. It doesn't care what creed the original owner followed.\n Here's an article from a guy with the Faith Based initiative thing who says it failed. (http://www.beliefnet.com/story/160/story_16092_1.html) In a news article I covered, he stated that evangelist were made fun of at the White House, not by Bush but by his advisors. He also has a book out IIRC.\n As to Bush himself, he's tied in with the Word of Faith pimps (Ted Haggard is/was a WofF pimp...ironic that he was a hypocrite and looked mean on the Jesus Camp documentary). \n \n I'd say from casual observations of these forums, that only EZ knows scripture well...how many here have said he's not christian enough? Something about him not being 'loving'.\n \n \n \nAnd is there a litmus test for atheists? A secret oath? Handshake? emoticon_rolleyes \n\n Nope, but there seems to be one for your average christian. Ignorance. Particularly of their own scriptures. \n \n \nThanks for making the argument in favor of faith-based initiatives. emoticon_xgood \n\n Nope, just making one for THAT particular faith organization. For every one who's on the up and up, there are some who are on the take.\n Whether it be the one I briefly worked for that was on the take (a ghastly organization if I say so) or one who's funds go where needed.\n Athiest merely seem to seek out what works or what suits their agendas and donate to that. \n \n \nAs my father used to say, words make damn thin gravy. Where's the proof that more than a small sampling of high-profile atheists give money to charity?\n\n The only poor who give when they can't are the ignorant ones following the ceaseless calls to do so for god. More often than not, they can't afford to do so and suffer because of it. \n \n \nIf <75% of the donors were atheists, I'd say that you'd be justified in saying that it was predominantly an atheist organization. \n\n To be honest, you can't assign random numbers. I could say all that's needed in 50.01% \n \n \nIf you can find one, do so.\n\n Did already. It's the PositiveAtheism one. Has the very question being discussed here responded to by many others. There are links to actual Atheist Charity sites there. \n \n \nI've read it. It's a good read. I suggest that you do the same. emoticon_xgood\n And for the typical donator, who is predominantly in the lower middle income level, you're foolish if you think it's a strategy to get tax deductions. What XXXXX would give $1 to charity to get a $0.30 decrease in his tax burden, if he even has one?emoticon_confused \n\n Actually, I'd say from just looking at your postings in general here, you don't. Not saying you have opinions on the bible, your own or those piped in during a sermon you heard. But, 1 Corinthians 4:4-5\n \"My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.\"\n I'm sure you'll want to spin that. But judging anothers heart is not scripturally what you're allowed to do. It is a private, hidden thing. You did so by labeling atheist stingy. You forget the weasly way to put things. SEEMS is a good weasly way out. 'Atheist seem stingy'. Observation rather than statement of fact.\n As to the donation issue. It's me pulling a you. I say something that sounds rediculous. Me= \"You're erronously claiming linking cause and effect.\n I have just as much ability to judge a persons heart as you seem to be doing and state that US charitable donations exist because it's a freaking tax deduction rather than due to the goodness of their hearts or because God told them so.\" Cause -< Effect = There a tax write offs for charitable giving which results in more giving. It's called mocking if done rudely. Maybe I should add emoticon_rolleyes as an insulting gesture and more easily get a point across. \n \n \nThose are some ofd the lamest excuses that I've ever heard. Where's \"the sun was in my eyes so I couldn't find my wallet?\"\n\n And yours are equally lame. No more than Simone posting Planned Parenthood links to support pro abortions stances. Imagine that. Someone using a biased site to support their position. Thus, why I post pro-Christian ones when needed for proof...against Christians.\n ANY biased source is going to be dismissed. Just like you did. Thus, I posted links to Christian Watchdog groups who will freely tell you which group that they've investigated is worth your funds and will properly steward them and which is a scam artist (Hey, this line of thought seems to be what got us in this debate in the 1st place. Me stating that I can be a religious scam artist and get away with it and you side stepping that fact and bringing up atheism as a red herring. \n Imagine if the mega churches (that I've mentioned) and the likes of the most popular 'charity' fund raisers, 700 Club, TBN, CBN and the like actually diverted the vast bulk of the funds they collected to the charitable humanitarian causes...so that \"one may know them by the fruits of their faith\" (oops going all religious there, sorry) and not skim the lions share off the top...80 percent, why I think we'd have a billion more dollars annually there.\n \n \nWould I be getting that treatment at St, John's, St. Mary's, St. Vincent's or St. Mark's Catholic Hospital? emoticon_confused \n\n Does it matter? The doc's are more athiestic than not. No different than the local Jewish hospital. I wonder which rich guy donated the funds for additional wing. Think he got a good tax write off?\n \n \nNo, I said\"No need to go through all of that. There are plenty of non-religious based cons out there. I'll bet you that there are even atheist cons like yourself out there. \" Now how you interpretted that as saying that atheists are better cons is beyond me. emoticon_confused emoticon_confused \n\n No need to say 'better'. But, I think this goes past you. It's implicit. Legal is better than illegal. No? Something I can blend in easily (I really do glide on the stage in my suit and know my bible well and can rehash nearly any sermon I've heard) and something that's already widely accepted (giving lots of money to the church man revivalist/ evangelist) is better than something that's vilified and persecuted. \n I really don't know why you'd object to someone like myself conning Christians ALSO out of their money just like allegedly true believers do. To date, there is NO proof that these pulpit pimps are Christians other than self labeled claims. It's not like me skimming a few million is hurting compared to the hundreds others across the US are already doing. I see it as akin to the give a penny, take a penny dish at the corner store. I'm taking a nickle, the pimps want the whole thing. Heck, I even know the fundamentals of Christian faith as well as sound doctrine. \n \n \nAgain, you attempt to put words in my mouth. I didn't claim that any organization that has Christians in it is a Christian organization. What I said was that the organization was funded and staffed predominantly by Christians. If you want to dig deeper, however, I'd argue that our government funds social programs to the level that it does because of the Christian values of charityheld by the majority of American voters. Our government's programs are representative of its population's desires.\n\n Nope, our govt's programs are based on political necessity and to gain influence in a region. Thus you see little done in places like Darfur but in other locations, food and money is dumped. \n You are claiming that charity comes from Christian values which isn't true. Hindus have charity as do Muslims. Even godless Buddhists can give for spiritual reasons...and do.\n I'd also say that America is nominally Christian. Just because your roots are christian and you apply that lable to yourself doesn't really make you one. We've seen this line of reasoning before. To date, I haven't seen you label yourself a Christian although it's imlied that you are one by the stances you take. Just as you erronoiusly lable me an atheist even though I've never put that title to myself. \n \n \nShow me where I said that any charitable organization was 100% Christian. Your strawman arguments keep catching fire. Perhaps it's from the fires of damnation? emoticon_rolleyes\n\n I don't have too. You make the implied statement (even above) that you're beliefs are that giving to charity is Christianity motivated. \n All I was doing was claiming that any organization with those requirements was atheistic. You can't disprove that because it's belief based on extrapolation. Much like many of your comments. Extrapolations based on personal beliefs and observations tainted with bias. \n You can claim a reason for personal charity.\n \n Heck, here's one confessed Christian con man. He even made a documentary about his exploits. Outing many of his fellow con men in the process.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjoe_Gortner\n There were some nice video clips of him on Youtube.com \n And that was over 35 years ago. Plenty of psychological break throughs were made inbetween then and now on manipulating the sucker out of his money. \n \n As the sayings goes, 'A fool and his money are soon parted' and 'A sucker is born every minute.'",

I never said anything about a 'building'. We've been over this in other threads that a Church is 'the people' not a structure. But, you'd have to be a bible reading christian to know this. Something many Christians aren't.\n \n For stuctures, Ted Haggard had THE biggest congregation in a building in CO. with New Life Church. He certainly lived high on the hog. Meth and male whores. If you don't think a super sized building housing thousands in an affluent part of the nation that ALSO has tourist (the group in the documentary Jesus Camp were making a pilgrimage there like others) appeal can rake in the dough...we're really wasting out time. Because from where I'm at, you seem to only be able to nay say what's already been covered in the mass media because I can't post a link that you would find acceptable.\n I posted Joyce because of the reasons stated. She's not even a top dog. Just someone well known in the circle, you can see her books in Wal Mart.\n \n \n One person doing what I've pointed out. \n T.D. Jakes has Potter House http://www.thepottershouse.org/\n http://www.ministrywatch.org/mw2.1/F_SumRpt.asp?EIN=311506712\n Oh, wait he won't release financial information...just like I've mentioned in a previous post. F rating by MinisteryWatch. I wonder hard if you'd consider that pimp worth more than the 100 mil Joyce pulls in or less. Or try to say 'well he does TV too' to get past his abundant wealth. Which he has NO problems defending due to his spin on scripture.\n He's Oneness. He's damned to hell for heresy and refusal to adhear to correct doctrine. \n \n How about Creflow Dollar with his New Birth in GA. http://www.creflodollarministries.org/\n http://www.ministrywatch.org/mw2.1/F_SumRpt.asp?EIN=000005020\n Opps, won't post his finances...because he doesn't have too.\n \n Kenneth Hagin who started the whole mess, an F too. http://www.ministrywatch.org/mw2.1/F_SumRpt.asp?EIN=751226882\n Not much to say, no transpancy. \n Find a Rhema WofF church. http://www.rhema.org/church/directory.cfm\n \n I do find it ironic that it's these 'christians' I'm attacking that so many want to defend. They're gnostics at best. The Apostle Paul warns about them, the bible has more warnings against these type of people wgho come amongst the flock to devour them. They are the promising rain clouds spoken of in the book of Jude. The Super Apostles Paul talks about as he gives his 'my weakness makes me strong' message.\n Genesis wrote a song about them, it was one I quoted...somewhere (what post are we on in this hijacked thread???) 'Jesus He Knows Me'\n And, even though many state they read their bibles, they are totally willing to take an attack on 'those who preach a diffrent gospel of the Christ' as Paul spoke of as an attack on actual Christians.\n It's for that level of idiocy that I feel bad for you people. You're deisre to protect those who seek to make filthy lucre off of you. Those ravenous beasts Jesus spoke of. But, then again J., you'd have to actually read the simple messages and hear rather than reinterpret scripture through the glasses of 'Jesus loves all' or what ever it is you use.\n \n These people are cultist who lead their groups not based on sound doctrine but on the power of personal magnitism.\n If you think you've been taken by a scammer in saints clothing, maybe Rick Ross http://www.rickross.com/ can help deprogram you. \n \n I'd simply go to www.PulpitPimps.org. Melvin does it better than I could with links and discussion. I also hate the cut paste form of debate. We're here to discuss ideals in an informal manner. \n \n Here's the Time Magainze article from last year on this theology http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1533448,00.html \n \n \n PS. I do owe you a response on the slavey post several pages back. I was typing one (lengthy) and it was lost. Was too busy at the time to retype it.\n \n But, I'ma gonna want bible verses to support your stances from time to time.

There are some fine atheist mathematicians, but even they would be hard pressed to find the sense in that equation. Pray tell what tax deduction I get for my donated time?\n\n The who judge not thing there is talking about HYPOCRITICALLT judging.\n Matthew 7:1-5 \"Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 2For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. \"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.\" \n The bible actually has many, MANY passages where you ARE to judge. Particularly Christians judging each other.\n If you know how to calculate your time, you can get compensation for that. Pro Bono for some professions.\n \n \nSo, who's stingy and who gives the most? You'll find that other Countries give more relatively speaking than Americans. You'll also not that in in some circumstances, charitable giving is artifically inflated due to somewhat selfish reasons. Say post Katrina or 911. I'm sure a spike ensured in US giving (to each other) rather than when a disaster occurs over seas (where we have to give to someone outside our sphere).\n \n I suggest you travel to the coast of France and stand amongst the thousands of mute marble testaments to how much this nation has given.\n\n Ummm... what's the point.\n I'm not talking about total over all but total per individual.\n It's called statistics. Like Satre, I can make selective ones say what I want.\n Non US citizens in some countries give more per person that Americans do. \n If a Canadian gives, on average .91 cents per person to the American's .87 cents (USD) who's giving more? Who's stingy? I'm sure you'd like to get the larger sum but who's showing the most generosity in their giving.\n This is the case in scripture of the widow lady giving her last 2 pennys vs a wealthy man tithing 10% of all he has. It's clear that for Christ, the poor lady giving all is more generous that the wealthy man. This is pretty mush the message Satre is trying to press. But, he probably doesn't know that in those times, the widow lady was cared for by the community and wouldn't NEED those 2 pennys. Something Jesus fails to mention.\n \n I wonder how much Christian funding goes to help the poor victims of Iranian earthquakes?",
