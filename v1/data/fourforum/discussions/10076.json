   "The story goes in all the evolutionists books that mammals evolved from reptiles. But for this to happen, lots of physiological changes would have had to take place. I would like to focus on one: the breast. I would like to know how or why reptiles would have formed them in the first place, because at some point a breast would have to form (and be selected) from a non-breasted reptile.\n \n First of all I would like to say that any reptile -- let's say lizard -- that happened to develop a random breast would still be a lizard -- a breasted lizard, but still a lizard. In fact, no matter how many mammal body parts you stack on top of a lizard, it will always be a lizard.\n \n Second, no mutation has ever formed a new body part, such as a new breast on a lizard. Anyone who cares to dispute this is welcome to provide a link.\n \n Third, even if in fairytale land a mutation did form a breast, who's to say that actual milk would flow from it? Would there also be lobes to produce the milk? How about the milk ducts to transport the milk to the nipple? Would both these accidentally form at the same time? How?\n \n Fourth, how about a nipple? Without that there is no feeding. So which formed first, the breast, the lobes, the milk ducts, or the nipple? You can't have a functional breast without each of these...and if the breasts aren't functional then the little cold-blooded lizards who don't drink milk to begin with would never get the opportunity to do so.\n \n Fifth, aren't there some signals that need to be sent from the brain before milk starts flowing? Ah -- well yes there are:\n \n http://www.asklenore.info/breastfeeding/induced_lactation/biology.html\n \n a signal is sent to the brain from the breast to release oxytocin which initiates the milk ejection or let down reflex (MER) and causes the milk to flow. \n \n Thus, how would a brain communicate with a feature it was not wired to communicate with? Did evolution somehow create the wiring for the breast at the same time as the milk ducts, the nipple and the breast itself?\n \n Also, how would the animal, since it is cold-blooded, keep the milk warm? You don't want your babies drinking cold milk do you?\n \n And who's to say that the male lizard wouldn't develop breasts? It's a 50/50 chance, you know. \n \n And how would a lizard crawl around effectively with multiple breasts hanging off him/her? Wouldn't they get drug across the ground? How could he climb a tree? His/her legs wouldn't reach the trunk if the breasts were full of milk!\n \n And don't lizards have multiple offspring? Like dozens? So what if the mother lizard only has like 5 breasts ---- simple math will tell you that most will go hungry.\n \n Finally, lizards don't generally hang around and tend to their offspring after they're born -- er, hatched. So what would make a lizard go against all previous instincts just because it happened to evolve a breast?",

Histology and pathology of a gland that may mimic mammary glands.\n \n van der Putte SC.\n \n Department of Pathology, Utrecht University Hospital, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands.\n \n A new variant of cutaneous glands is described that occurs in the anogenital region, with its highest concentration in the interlabial sulcus of the vulva. The glands are characterized by a wide coiled tube from which originate acini, diverticula, and short branches; a lining of a compact simple columnar epithelium with prominent cytoplasmic snouts protruding into the lumen; and a broad mantle of loose fibromyxoid to dense collagenous connective tissue. Occasionally, true lobuli are formed resembling those of mammary glands. A close relationship to eccrine glands was evidenced by intermediate variants and the occasional observation of typical eccrine segments in otherwise characteristic anogenital glands. The glands revealed periodic changes of epithelium and stroma. Their strict localization around the derivatives of the embryonic cloacal entrance suggests a possible role in sexual functions. Their characteristic histology links and explains a series of disorders of the anogenital region in women (including functional vulvar mammary glands after pregnancy, fibrocystic disease, fibroadenoma, hidradenoma papilliferum, and some cases of adenocarcinoma, including Paget's disease) and in men [including fibroadenoma or apocrine cystadenoma, and cases of Paget's disease].\n",

I do not think that that anyone seeing the vast differences in the 'bones' of the fossil record can deny that they change from one to the other, and putting that change together with geological change and its 'time' constraints, deny that they 'changed over time'. At least not rationally; the irrational alternative being that the earth, its 'bones', and everything else, arose instantaneously, as is, all at once. That what it is is exactly what it has always been, and that 'change over time' is an illusion.\n \n Once the rational position, that is, that the 'bones' found in the fossil record 'changed over time' is accepted, then the issue becomes the question of 'how' and in what manner they changed, and in what correlation with time did they change?\n \n The time correlation is the big issue, with darwinists opting for a universal uniformitarian gradualism [teeny-weeny changes]at the phenotypic level, but instantaneous spontaneous magical 'poofs' [powerful,meaningful changes] at the genetic level, and opposed to that, with creationists opting for one single instance, or a series of anomalous individual instances, of instantaneous spontaneous miraculous 'poofs', at all levels. \n \n From this the darwinists maintain that life is one thing that is seen to change its forms over time, while creationists insist that that there is no single continuity, but simply forms that pop into existence, at least for a certain space of time, unique, disconnected and independent of all and any other forms.\n \n They are both wrong, of course, but the creationists are even more wrong, i.e., irrational, than the darwinists, on this point. And if gman is adopting the creationist view that the fossil record is not evidence of change in one unity, Life, over time, and holds to the creationist view that all 'lives' are particular, distinct, separate, unique and disconnected anomalous entities, then I can once more cheerfully disagree with him.

   "I could say nature does this or that without meaning to imply that nature is a conscious entity. Poetic maybe but hardly intentional deception. \n\n \n **\n Certain things do happen naturally, and not artificially or anthropomorphically, so in those cases it is perfectly OK to speak of natural events as things that 'nature' does; since in that case the word, 'nature', acts simply as a collective noun for all things natural, taken together.\n \n But that is not at all the case with the duplicitous misuse of the word, 'selection', by darwinists. \"Selection\" is not a property of anything that lacks an aware mind, sense perceptions, a values system, a sense of identity, an ability to analyse options, and to voluntarily choose among those options the one that best suits its own purposes. That means that 'selection' is a psychical trait limited to live organisms, and is not shared among the non-living, purely physical parts of 'nature', as a whole. Including such natural non-psychical, physical phenomena as climate, weather, plate tectonics, planetary motion, erosion, chemical reactions, and so on and so forth.\n No sieve ever 'selected', 'chose', what it would withold or what it would not.\n \n \n\n Individuals cannot \"evolve\" physical traits that are passed on to their descendants genetically. I know you believe otherwise.\n\n \n **\n What makes you think this? What evidence do you have to back yourself up on this bold declaration? Since it is factual that novel, original traits do 'evolve', organismically, later to be passed on to that organism's descendents, if these individual organisms are not responsible for it, then who or what is? God? Mother Nature? The Great Flying Spaghetti Monster? Random, spontaneously generated reconfigurations of acid molecules? \"Natural Selection\"? Aliens from Outer Space?\n \n \n \n \n Exactly. Poetic in a manner of speaking. Nothing more. No conspiracy.\n\n \n **\n So long as it was merely a poetic metaphor, no problem. But right from the jump Darwin and pals passed it off as an actual, empirical, natural force that drove organismic change over time. And passing off a metaphor as a scientific mechanism was, and still is, an egregious violation of scientific ethics. It is a lie, and a deliberate, cunning lie, pure and simple.\n \n \n\n What purposes are served? Nevermind my morals. \n\n \n **\n The purposes, as all the world knows, was to make it look like evolution, and by extension, Life itself, could 'just happen, that's all'; without any need for the 'god' or 'divine something' that 19th century atheists, 20th century atheists, and you guys, today, are desperately trying to banish from social reality. That's what, and whose, \"purposes are served\".\n \n As for your morals, if you and your friends were to mind them as you ought, nobody else would have to.\n \n \n \n\n Yes, I know. I didn't mean to suggest that language was a conscious entity either. You have trouble in this area, don't you?\n\n \n **\n Since it is you, not me, that screwed up the distinction, it is obviously you who has the trouble in this area, and me, who had to point it out to you, who has no trouble with it at all. I see that, havimng run out of anything admirable to offer, you now sink to slimy and false insinuation. How darwinian of you!\n \n \n\n Mislead to what conclusion? That nature has a mind? I don't follow.\n\n \n **\n To mislead the public into believing that you were not putting forth an explanation for life that was, and still is, mindless, pointless, meaningless, mechanical, and absurd. But cunningly cloaked behind anthropomophic and teleological language that IS ENTIRELY INNAPROPRIATE, AND THUS ENTIRELY DISHONEST, within the context of your purely materialist/mechanical ateleological conception of biology and its evolution.\n \n And if you still cannot \"follow\" that, then you are lying to yourself and no-one can help you.",

That is simply a fact.

No semantic correlation that would excuse the contrived equivocation.\n Not to mention that the biological 'definition' is so nebulous as to be meaningless in any scientific context.\n \n Let's try the root word, 'to select', shall we?\n \n \"se\u00b7lect (s&#301;-l&#277;kt') \n \n v., -lect\u00b7ed, -lect\u00b7ing, -lects.\n \n v.tr.\n To take as a choice from among several; pick out.\n \n v.intr.\n To make a choice or selection.\"\n \n Just try to subtract awareness, analysis, and volition from that, why don't you? Just try and turn 'to select', into a blind, come-by-chance, mindless accidental, unintentional operation, why don't you?\n \n \n\n Actually, we are not doing that, and your concern about the wording and meaning of \"natural selection\" will not change that.\n\n \n **\n Nothing can change darwinism, because there is nothing of substance in it that would be susceptible to change. You cannot change the meaning of the meaningless.\n \n \n \n\n We consider natural selection to be a completely mindless process which works because of differing rates of reproduction and has no supernatural connotations whatsoever.\n\n \n **\n Now you are doing a stupid thing--you are trying to turn an effect [\"differing rates of reproduction\", into their own cause, or, equally stupid, you are claiming that because this effect is observable, its cause must be the notional fabrication, \"NS\", that you choose to apply to it out of pure speculation and imagination. The old, \"We do not know what causes this, but we are going to call that unknown something, \"Natural Selection\", and then we can just act as if we actually know something!\" Duh!!\n \n \n\n 1/ WW argues that \"natural selection\" implies consciousness.\n\n \n A lie. WW argues that \"natural selection\" [FALSELY] implies consciousness.\"\n A consciousness falsely implied by the dishonestly employed word, 'selection'.\n \n \n\n 2) WW denounces us for implying that natural selection is a conscious process.\n\n \n **\n Exactly. You know that your notion has no place in it for conscious intended behaviour of any kind, and yet, in order to make your soulless mechanics palatable to the public, you use anthropomorphic and teleological language that will cloak its true nature from their understanding, implying, in contravention of your true beliefs, that your mechanism does behave as the real selection process does, and so you make it palatable to the public.

In fact, the use of the word, \"natural\" implies that this form of selection is done by \"nature,\" or, in other words, that it is done randomly.\n \n Also consider that the people who completely misunderstand evolution tend to argue that the ToE claims that evolution happens randomly.",

   "TQ is right in his harsh assessment of me, I am not studied.\nAnd therefore, your opinions on the subject are worthless. Unless you at least have the integrity to learn the basics of what you claim to oppose, how can you claim to oppose them?\n \nBut, I have opinions and am I'm not bashful.\nNo matter how much your opinions make you look foolish.\n \nBut not stupid either.\nNot as yet established.\n \nIf any of these issues had been unequivically [sic] proven absolute without needing the support of consensus I would concede the issue.\nThen you know nothing about science since none of it is proven unequivocally. To claim otherwise demonstrates gross ignorance of what science is and how it works.\n \nThe reason I challenge consensus is because believers in God are ridiculed for belief in something they too can not prove and labeled unkindly by people who in kind can not disprove their belief.\nNot quite. Believers in some magic god are ridiculed when they try to present their religion as science, or, as in your case, try to lower science to the status of belief in mythology without evidence. Of course, such believers always argue that \"evolution is only a theory\", just as you do. Rarely do you ever argue that gravity is only a theory, or that germs cause diseases is only a theory, nor to you protest nuclear power plants because their operation is based completely on theory. Perhaps you wouldn't make yourself look so foolish if you actually learned what is meant by the word \"theory\" in science. Would you like me to explain it to you?\n \nHowever unbelievable a presentation is, possibilities exist.\nRight. You display a common argument of creationism, one that caused believers to be ridicules so strongly. Your argument boils down to \"it cudda been.\" There confidence that we place in possibilities varies with the evidence in support of that possibility. \"A magical sky being did it,\" merits no confidence. Though we might technically say that it is possible, it is so fantastically improbable that it is illogical not to reject such possibility out of hand.\n \nI wish I could explain the origin of mammals. I'd be a popular fellow, eh?\nBut you know so little that it isn't even possible that you could explain the origin of mammals. That's the way it is with crusaders against science like you. You prefer to cling to medieval mythology rather than accept science.",

   "Let's just get to the main points here:\n \n The word \"selection\" is completely irrelevant to the process described by \"natural selection.\" \n\n \n **\n Then why is it there?!?\n \n \n\n \"Natural selection\" is simply a name for a well-defined, well understood (by scientists, at least), and well-supported process.\n\n \n **\n Ah, that which started out as the explanatory mechanism, the driving force behind darwinian evolution, has been downgraded to a simple 'process', just like evolution itself is a 'process'. Funnily enough, darwinists seem to define these two 'processes' in the same way, as if they were the same 'process', with two different names! Hmmm. \n \n Well, nevermind, the whole point of our debates is to establish the mechanism that drives the evolutionary process, so at this point it seems logical to ask, so what mechanism drives the \"Natural Selection\" 'process'?\n A 'process' being-- [from answers.com]\n \n \"proc\u00b7ess1 (pr&#335;s'&#277;s', pr&#333;'s&#277;s') \n n., pl. proc\u00b7ess\u00b7es (pr&#335;s'&#277;s'&#301;z, pr&#333;'s&#277;s'-, pr&#335;s'&#301;-s&#275;z', pr&#333;'s&#301;-).\n A series of actions, changes, or functions bringing about a result: the process of digestion; the process of obtaining a driver's license.\n A series of operations performed in the making or treatment of a product: a manufacturing process; leather dyed during the tanning process.[bold mine]\n Progress; passage: the process of time; events now in process.\n Law. The entire course of a judicial proceeding.\n Law. \n A summons or writ ordering a defendant to appear in court.\n The total quantity of summonses or writs issued in a particular proceeding.\n Biology. An outgrowth of tissue; a projecting part: a bony process.\n Any of various photomechanical or photoengraving methods.\n Computer Science. \n A running software program or other computing operation.\n A part of a running software program or other computing operation that does a single task.\n See conk3.\"\n \n IMO, the bolded meanings are the most applicable here. Basically they say that a process is an historical series of cause/effect change events. Or, IOW, stuff that happens. Which is basically meaningless unless and until particularized in a given case, with specific origins, causes, effects, and final outcomes. Which brings us to an interesting aspect of the word--though it does not entail teleology, it implies it. With teleology the mechanism driving a process is 'motive'--the motivation to create or achieve a product/goal.\n \n But what about an ateleological process? What mechanism drives mindless, purposeless, mechanical processes? Darwinists insist that all biological processes are simply chemical processes, and even 'evolution' is simply the chemical process of being reconfiguered within a 'genome'. That is, genomes are what evolve--organismic evolution is merely an 'epiphenomenon' of genomic evolution.\n \n So what is their 'mechanism' for this mechanical process? They do not have a real one. Instead they appeal to the magic of \"spontaneous generation\" and \"emergence\". All they can claim, in the end, is that all of the effects of this process are 'random',-- because some of them are. Crazy, but they do say this.\n \n So what is the driving mechanism behind darwinism's newly re-categorized ateleological 'process', \"Natural Selection\"? More 'spontaneous, random, emergent, ethereal, quasi-mystical' forces of some unspecified kind? Such as what, I wonder?\n \n \n\n Scientists have no inclination or need to try to convince the general public that natural selection has a conscious entity behind it.\n\n \n **\n Scientists don't that's true. But I'm not talking about scientists. I'm talking about the evangelical atheists who make up the ranks of darwinists. They need to hide from the public that their worldview, the view that concocted 'natural selection', is a mindless, souless, absurd, pointless world of zombies and automatons, all passive slaves to their own chemistry.\n \n \n\n In fact, the use of the word, \"natural\" implies that this form of selection is done by \"nature,\" or, in other words, that it is done randomly.\n\n \n **\n I do not think that, 'natural', naturally implies any such thing. I look up 'natural', and nowhere do I find the slightest indication that 'nature' implies, 'random'. You're making that up.\n But it is a fact that that darwinists always use the word 'natural' where the honest word for their true intended meaning is, 'mechanical'. They do this for the same duplicitous reasons we've been speaking of, and they do it with a lot of words.\n \n \n\n Also consider that the people who completely misunderstand evolution tend to argue that the ToE claims that evolution happens randomly.\n\n \n **\n On the contrary. What I am pointing out here is that darwinists claim that their \"TOE\" does _not_ happen 'randomly', is _not_ 'chance-based', when in fact that is exactly what it truly is. One more lie to fool the public withal.\n \n The fact is that there are only three ways that any event or series of events can come to pass--\n a/by pure chance, stochastically, accidentally, purposelessly and ateleologically.\n b/mechanically, regularly, deterministically, inevitably, automatically and with no immediate, proximate or extended intrinsic purpose or end, but entirely ateleologically and meaninglessly.\n c/teleologically, intentionally, purposefully, meaningfully.\n \n You guys dismiss \"c/\" out of hand. You insist that your evolution is not \"a/\", but you have absolutely no empirical evidence of any kind to support your claim that your 'RMNS' evolution is a matter of \"b/\". On the contrary, any good empirical look at the natural world quickly shows that RMNS is \"a/\", right down to its toes. \"RM\" is 'chance' personified, and \"NS\" has no element of \"b/\" in it, except what darwinists project upon it, psychologically.",

Funnily enough, darwinists seem to define these two 'processes' in the same way, as if they were the same 'process', with two different names! Hmmm.\nNo, they don't. You'd think that if you were going to argue about evolutionary theory you would want to learn the basics so that you don't make yourself look foolish.\n \nWell, nevermind, the whole point of our debates is to establish the mechanism that drives the evolutionary process, so at this point it seems logical to ask, so what mechanism drives the \"Natural Selection\" 'process'?\nA perfect example. Only a person who is ignorant of evolutionary theory would ask to establish the mechanism that drives the evolutionary process. Natural selection is only one of the mechanisms of evolution.\n \n But since you want to learn, and since all of this seems so new to you, I'll explain what drives natural selection for you.\n \n Darwin's Explanatory Model of Natural Selection\n \n Fact 1. Every population has such high fertility that its size would increase exponentially if it were not constrained.\n \n Fact 2. The size of populations, except for temporary annual fluctuations, remains stable over time.\n \n Fact 3. The resources available to every species are limited.\n Inference 1. There is intense competition among the members of a species.\n Fact 4. No two individuals of a population are exactly the same.\n Inference 2. Individuals of a population differ from each other in the probability of survival (i.e., natural selection).\n Fact 5. Many of the differences among the individuals of a population are, at least in part, heritable.\n Inference 3. Natural selection, continued over many generations, results in evolution.\n Notice that there isn't a hint of some intelligence behind any of it. Natural selection is the probability of survival. It has also been called differential reproductive success. Perhaps that will help you to clear up the confusion that causes you to equate evolution, a process that is the result of many mechanisms, from natural selection (one of those mechanisms).\n \n Hope that helps.",

Science asks you to have faith that the observed data can mean something, that the universe is in some way understandable. That faith has been shown to be well placed time and time again, unlike your religious faith, which has never been shown to be based on reality. So sure, science requires you to accept certain axioms \"on faith\", but to pretend that in any way equates to a religion or weakens science somehow is simple foolishness.\n \n If you want to refute my stance, I suggest you try using more than one sentence at a go, you might find it easier to present a full fledged idea that way.",

   "**The word 'selection' does entail at least primitive consciousness, i.e., awareness. That is simply a fact. In view of that fact, by using that term, Charles Darwin and every darwinist who has ever used 'natural selection' as the signification for a real phenomenon has implicitly endowed the term with a perceiving and comprehending awareness, value judgement/evaluation, and directed choice.\n \n To say that 'selection', like 'competition', can be unaware and involuntary is to talk pure semantic rubbish.\n \n See below, from answers.com\n \n \"se\u00b7lec\u00b7tion (s&#301;-l&#277;k'sh&#601;n) \n n.\n \n The act or an instance of selecting or the fact of having been selected.\n One that is selected.\n A carefully chosen or representative collection of people or things.

Now note the total dissimilarity between the above and the \"biological\" [meaning, \"darwinist\"] definition that follows--\n \n \"Biology. A natural or artificial process that favors or induces survival and perpetuation of one kind of organism over others that die or fail to produce offspring.\"\n \n See? No semantic correlation that would excuse the contrived equivocation.\n Not to mention that the biological 'definition' is so nebulous as to be meaningless in any scientific context.\n \n Let's try the root word, 'to select', shall we?\n \n \"se\u00b7lect (s&#301;-l&#277;kt') \n \n v., -lect\u00b7ed, -lect\u00b7ing, -lects.\n \n v.tr.\n To take as a choice from among several; pick out.\n \n v.intr.\n To make a choice or selection.\"\n \n Just try to subtract awareness, analysis, and volition from that, why don't you? Just try and turn 'to select', into a blind, come-by-chance, mindless accidental, unintentional operation, why don't you?\n \n\n \n Another piece of WW nonsense, which I intended to respond to but forgot.\n \n Let's repeat that first bit again for emphasis, because it is wrong: \n\"The word 'selection' does entail at least primitive consciousness, i.e., awareness. That is simply a fact. In view of that fact, by using that term, Charles Darwin and every darwinist who has ever used 'natural selection' as the signification for a real phenomenon has implicitly endowed the term with a perceiving and comprehending awareness, value judgement/evaluation, and directed choice.\"\n\n \n Let's see what Darwin actually said on this matter, because he was, in fact, quite explicit that he intended otherwise: \n(from the 5th edition of the Origin of Species) Others have objected that the term selection implies conscious choice in the animals which become modified; and it has even been urged that, as plants have no volition, natural selection is not applicable to them! In the literal sense of the word, no doubt, natural selection is a false term; but who ever objected to chemists speaking of the elective affinities of the various elements?-and yet an acid cannot strictly be said to elect the base with which it in preference combines. It has been said that I speak of natural selection as an active power or Deity; but who objects to an author speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets? Every one knows what is meant and is implied by such metaphorical expressions; and they are almost necessary for brevity. So again it is difficult to avoid personifying the word Nature; but I mean by Nature, only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained by us. With a little familiarity such superficial objections will be forgotten.\n\n \n Darwin explains elsewhere that he chose \"natural selection\" as a comparison to artificial selection, by breeding plus culling. He saw that 'nature\" (events in the normal courses of the lives of the members of a species) were directly but unconciously culling the species and conferring on them very different degrees of reproductive success.\n \n (However, Darwin was in fact wrong on the last point, in failing to anticipate WW.)\n \n \n (Incidentally, Mike, you were complaining about lost posts: FWIW, I noticed yesterday that on my system editing in the regular edit & save facility takes a while to post a change and caused one edit to be lost, whereas using the \"go advanced\" edit always seems to get the edit posted very quickly.)",

   "Indeed the concept of selection and selectivity are deeply embedded in science and technology. We speak of selective filters, selective reactions, selective mechanical processes, selective this and selective that. And its all process related. Suppose we have things with a composition vector Xi and those things are subjected to a process such that Xi give rise to Xj. If Xit is the total count of Xi and Xjt is the total count for Xj then selection is present if the input vector Xi/Xit is not equal to the output vector Xj/Xjt. In other words selectivity only requires that the composition vector changes during the process.\n \n This is of course what Darwin meant by the term and it does not in any way require that the process involved be intelligent, intentional, externally directed, or anything but existant.\n \n One can joust in the verbal mode forever on this sort of thing, but a simple and clear mathematical definition leaves no room to debate what we mean by selection. Its clumsy here without notational conveniences and one is forced to use words instead, but surely even WW can grasp the actual meaning as intended by biologists and chemists etc. Common usage and technical usage often are a loggerheads, but technical usage is usually tightly defined by those who use the term. Selection is such a term. WW is simply wrong here.\n \n And one must needs consider Darwins admonitions. The term is in fact \"natural selection\" which implies selection caused by natural processes or variables and indeed the contrarst to \"artificial selection\" done by humans which IS volitional, intentional, and directed to a goal is striking. \"Natural selection\" has none of those properties you realize. The processes underlying natural selection are not set in place by minds (divine or human) but rather by the operation of nature via (ultimately) physics and chemistry.\n \n Now just for the fun of it lets apply the dictionary to the term \"natural selection\" and what turns up?\n \n natural selection\n One entry found for natural selection.\n Main Entry: natural selection\n Function: noun\n : a natural process that results in the survival and reproductive success of individuals or groups best adjusted to their environment and that leads to the perpetuation of genetic qualities best suited to that particular environment",
