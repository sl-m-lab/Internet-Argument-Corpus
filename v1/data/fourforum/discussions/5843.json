Why should I feel any sympathy towards her now? She made her bed and is now lying in it. Period.\n\n \n You should feel sympathy because she was not happy when she was with her \"normal\" family. She saught to do what made her happy, what makes her happier now than she was. Yet she isn't as happy as she could be; she isn't treated the same, and she doesn't recieve the same benefits. It's true that she could have recieved those benefits if she chose to stay with her first family, but she decided to live with the person she loved. The reason she is facing shortcomings today is not just because she changed relationships, the reason is because of you and people like you. It's because you and people like you are unwilling to grant benefits to other people unless they live the way you demand.\n \n But people aren't always going to live the way you demand. Sometimes they might try to, only to realize that they can't do it. But they aren't wrong because they can't do it; you're wrong because you want them to. Feel sympathy for Justine because it is now the majority that prevents her from being happy, not her own actions.\n \n \nI'm getting weary of these contrieved comparisons. Gays aren't slaves; gays aren't being burned at the stake. In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to argue that gays are disadvantaged at all, given the fact that they are amongst the most affluent of minorities.\n\n \n And also among the most hated, the most untolerated, the most disapproved of, and among the few who face restrictions on our laws designed to prevent them from recieving the same benefits that anyone else has.\n \n You should be tired of the comparisons because I've repeated them enough. You're right that gays don't face disadvantages so great as being burned at the stake, but my point was never that they do face disadvantages so great. My point is that we should not put the welfare of anyone up to the vote of the people. The vote of the people might very well be evil; it doesn't dictate morality. Yet I see you again complaining about \"activist judges\" and presenting the vote of the people as a solution.\n \n My point is first that you should be estatic that activist judges exist when they protect morality, and you should be angry at them when they defy it. My point is that you should think the same thing about the vote of the people.\n \n \nMorally wrong? My God AND Church believe that homosexuality is morally wrong. IMO, not supporting gay marriage is morally right.\n\n \n Which indicates that you believe the opinion of your God and your church should be used to determine the rights and benefits granted to people who neither believe nor practice your religion? I should argue here that Jesus spoke of leading by example, not by force, of teaching instead of punishing. But I would rather you agree with the principle that using your religion as the sole basis for placing a legal restriction on benefits for a minority group is nothing more than putting your own beliefs above everyone else's. It is elevating yourself above others, and it is simply morally wrong.\n \n \nHow come preserving and furthering morality becomes a governmental function to you while other gay activists want to divorce morality and religious beliefs from government? You can't have it both ways. You either have a government that uses moral beliefs in its deliberations or they don't. You can't turn it on and off as you see fit in order to further your own personal agenda.\n\n \n I don't want to divorce religion from government; I just don't want a government that elevates some religions above all others. And I certainly don't want to divorce morality from government; a government must be based completely on morality, in my opinion. If a government isn't moral, it is nothing. But morality to me doesn't mean choosing the majority religion's list of \"bad things\" and using the law to restrict them. Morality to me means preserving and extending the life, liberty, and happiness of everyone. It means treating every citizen as I would treat myself, or at least doing my best to accomplish that goal.",

It's true that she could have recieved those benefits if she chose to stay with her first family, but she decided to live with the person she loved. The reason she is facing shortcomings today is not just because she changed relationships, the reason is because of you and people like you. It's because you and people like you are unwilling to grant benefits to other people unless they live the way you demand.\n\n that's entirely false. The reason that she is facing shortcomings now is precisely because she changed relationships. You stated above that she isn't treated the same and doesn't receive the same benefits now. THAT WAS HER CHOICE. She chose to forego a normal family relationship in favor of an abnormal one, lost her benefits and wants me to feel sorry for the poor choice that she made for both herself and child? No, I save my pity for someone who is in a pickle NOT of their own making. In boxing terms, she knowingly walked into a right hand and was KO'd. She had a choice between normalcy for her and her child, but instead, chose an abnormal relationship with its concommittant baggage because she wanted \"happiness\" for herself. Not an altruistic move, IMO. Even if my relationship with my wife soured, I would struggle to maintain a family unit for the sake of my kids. Maybe its the old-fashioned Italian in me, but I place my kids above all else. That's what a responsible parent does. \n \n\n But people aren't always going to live the way you demand. Sometimes they might try to, only to realize that they can't do it. But they aren't wrong because they can't do it; you're wrong because you want them to. Feel sympathy for Justine because it is now the majority that prevents her from being happy, not her own actions.\n\n Sometimes one must sacrifice their personal happiness for their children. I wonder what hardships her child has had to endure because his/her mom acted in her self-interests. Again, I don't begin to know the full circumstances of JC's marriage, but unless her husband was abusive, IMO, she owed it to her child to do what was best for them, NOT her.\n I'm not demanding that she adopt MY lifestyle. I don't possess that amount of power over anyone. No Svengali here, sorry. :) \n \n\n And also among the most hated, the most untolerated, the most disapproved of, and among the few who face restrictions on our laws designed to prevent them from recieving the same benefits that anyone else has.\n\n If you don't meet the criteria, then the restrictions that they face are no different than any of us that don't fall into a \"favored minority\" category. I'm not crying because I can't take advantage of AA or have to pay income taxes while Native Americans don't. What's the difference? What makes gays sooo special that they should be affored additional benefits without meeting the established criteria for those benefits?\n \n\n You should be tired of the comparisons because I've repeated them enough. You're right that gays don't face disadvantages so great as being burned at the stake, but my point was never that they do face disadvantages so great. My point is that we should not put the welfare of anyone up to the vote of the people. The vote of the people might very well be evil; it doesn't dictate morality. Yet I see you again complaining about \"activist judges\" and presenting the vote of the people as a solution.\n\n Your comparisomns are apples to oranges. Slaves experienced \"real\" discrimination and no freedom. Nobody is chaining gays up and making them work for free. As a group, they're more affluent than the average hetero, so they must not be too disadvantaged.\n \n\n My point is first that you should be estatic that activist judges exist when they protect morality, and you should be angry at them when they defy it. My point is that you should think the same thing about the vote of the people.\n\n I don't want ANY activist judges, whether they rule for or against me. I'm a strict Constitutionalist. The Constitution means what it says. Period. If we don't like what it says or believe that it has become dated, then we should exercise our right to redress government lawfully. The Constitution has provisions in it for changing laws. It's called \"amending the Constitution.\" \n \n\n Which indicates that you believe the opinion of your God and your church should be used to determine the rights and benefits granted to people who neither believe nor practice your religion? I should argue here that Jesus spoke of leading by example, not by force, of teaching instead of punishing. But I would rather you agree with the principle that using your religion as the sole basis for placing a legal restriction on benefits for a minority group is nothing more than putting your own beliefs above everyone else's. It is elevating yourself above others, and it is simply morally wrong.\n\n What's morally wrong is allowing laws to be made that are in opposition to your morality. I don't feel the need to apologize for my beliefs, nor do I feel that I have to compromise my morality to appease a minority group that, IMO, practices immorality. Now, everybody wants to use the Bible for their own purposes and I will admit to quoting scripture that supports the fact that God looks unfavorably on homosexuality. But, I also realize that government should be secular. I don't want our country to be governed by Christian fundamentalist or agnostics and atheists. I want laws based on common sense and common decency, agreed upon by the electorate whenever there is the need to tread new ground not already covered in the Constitution.\n \n\n I don't want to divorce religion from government; I just don't want a government that elevates some religions above all others. And I certainly don't want to divorce morality from government; a government must be based completely on morality, in my opinion. If a government isn't moral, it is nothing. But morality to me doesn't mean choosing the majority religion's list of \"bad things\" and using the law to restrict them. Morality to me means preserving and extending the life, liberty, and happiness of everyone. It means treating every citizen as I would treat myself, or at least doing my best to accomplish that goal.\n\n \n You want a morality-based government that doesn't exercise its morality. The majority of Americans, 80%, identify themselves as Christians. The majority of Christian religions believe that gay marriage is not acceptable, but yet you want the electorate to act morally. Don't you see the dichotomy in your position? You want the government to be \"selectively\" moral. That's not possible, nor desirable, IMO.\n \n Now, I'm sure that my statements above seem rather harsh and cold-hearted and perhaps they are. But, to me, parents sometimes have to sacrifice their own happiness for the good of their kids and I only see JC's actions as looking out for #1. That's not acting as a responsible parent, IMO.

I can't legally make a contract to purchase a kilo of heroine can I? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n Please reread that First Amendment Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n It says CONGRESS dosn't say anything about the states. The states under the 10th then can regulate or outlaw religious practice.\n I thought you conservatives were all for the strict intreprtation of the constitution. \n\n I'm dueling with an unarmed man. Jeez. Do yourself a favor. Go read some articles on the Constitution and its meaning. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n So you are saying that the courts should over rule the will of the people then?\n Once again where in the constitution does it say the federal government has the power to outlaw drugs. I thought you conservatives were all for the strict intreprtation of the constitution.\n\n \n You haven't been paying attention. I wrote that I believe that the Federal gov't doesn't have the authority to regulate what I ingest.

   "Every time Democrats win an election here in Michigan, they're imposing on me. :xcensored\n\n \n That is probably true; though the fact that they are elected does not impose on you, the laws that they pass very well may.\n \n \nThen you're also against affirmative action and all other forms of favoritism? Even Senior Citizen discounts, right?\n\n \n I am opposed to affirmative action, and senior citizen discounts isn't the best example, as that tends to be an individual business choice, not a government law. But there are some cases where I approve of preferrential treatment: social security, for example, or special handicapped benefits.\n \n But aren't those preferrential treatments harmful as well? The answer is: yes. By giving special benefits to the elderly or to handicapped people, we are creating a harm. However, that sort of preferrential treatment does not deny equality. Social security is designed to supplement the elderly with an income during a period of their life when they are less able to bring in an income. Handicapped benefits are designed to ease the burden of travelling felt by handicapped people.\n \n Handicapped benefits are a great example, I think. We don't just throw money at handicapped people, we give them special parking spots and pass laws to assure they have access to buildings. We try to make their lives as easy as the next man's, not easier. Handicapped people and the elderly have special needs, and we give them benefits to address those needs. Perhaps the most important thing I can say is that if some other group of people is found to have the same special disadvantages and needs of handicapped people, we should give that other group the same special benefits. Such is the case of same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples.\n \n We do not give opposite-sex couples benefits because they have some special need for those benefits, we give them benefits because the majority wants to give themselves benefits. We give them benefits not because they are disadvantaged but because the majority wants to control people's lives, wants to teach people that homosexuality is wrong, when they have no place putting that teaching into law. If either group deserved benefits over the other, it would be the group facing a more difficult time in our society, same-sex couples (though neither group does deserve benefits over the other). Giving opposite-sex couples benefits is equivalent to giving benefits to white people; white people don't need benefits. They already live better than anyone.\n \n \nYep and one of the minorities hurt by the majority daily are wealthy people. Because of class envy, the wealthy are preyed upon by Congress on behalf of the majority that aren't wealthy. Do you think that is wrong, as well?\n\n \n I see your point, so let me first address the question as you intended it. In the case of the wealthy, they are the most advantaged in society. Everyone below them faces additional need. In order to accomodate that need, it is acceptable to give benefits to those with lower incomes. It can be acceptable to give people who face a greater disadvantage, those who are less wealthy, benefits not held by those who are more wealthy. But in direct answer to your question: yes. It is wrong to benefit any person over another. The question is whether it is more wrong to allow the disadvantage faced by lower-income individuals to remain. In my opinion, it is more wrong to do that, and the lesser of two wrongs becomes the moral thing to do. But if I did not make it clear above, let me do it now: it is wrong to benefit one person over another.\n \n Now, I should also mention that the wealthy are a special case. The wealthy are made wealthy because of the laws already in existence in our nation. Our current set of laws, the laws that form capitalism, are laws that benefit people with ingenuity, people willing to take risks, sometimes people willing to step on others, people who are hard workers, and people who are well-educated. It also benefits people who already have money over people who don't. If our government had instituted some other system, it could instead be the smartest people, those who contribute most to society, those who are the most kind and caring, and those who are the most generous that are elevated to the top. There is not really a good reason that those people shouldn't be elevated, if we're going to elevate someone.\n \n But we choose capitalism because that provides us with the best economy, the most income, the strongest nation. We choose it knowing that we're going to elevate those who will become wealthy over everyone else. But just because capitalism is going to elevate some people over many people in terms of wealth, that doesn't mean that those people should be elevated over everyone else. And if it is possible to maintain the benefits of capitalism without elevating those people over everyone else, it is our responsibility to create a government that doesn't elevate those people. If removing that inequality destroys capitalism's benefits, then perhaps minimizing that equality is the best we can do.\n \n The wealthy are a special case, as I said.\n \n \nMorality is one of the areas that isn't protected in the Constitution. Because of that, purely democratic processes can occur almost unfettered. If ALL of our government functioned similarly, I'd be scared as well.\n\n \n I'm not certain what you mean here. I would argue that an individual's moral opinion is protected by the Constitution. I wouldn't necessarily say that homosexuality is protected by the Constitution; that's up for debate. But those things aren't important in the discussion of gay rights; whether the Constitution protects homosexuality or same-sex marriage does not indicate whether homosexuality or same-sex marriage is actually morally right or wrong.\n \n My point in the paragraph you're responding to was not that people don't currently have the right to vote on morality in a purely democratic process. Surely the Constitution allows states to decide how to determine such issues, and most states have allowed for a purely democratic process. But I do not believe that determining those things through a purely democratic process, a direct vote of the people, is ever a good idea. Morality and civil rights are the worst things you can leave up to the whim of the majority because the majority will too often deny the rights of the minority. The majority does not often understand freedom. In morality and civil rights, as in anything, the power of the majority should be checked by the government, just as the power of the government should be checked by the majority.",

Social security is designed to supplement the elderly with an income during a period of their life when they are less able to bring in an income.\n\n \n SS is one of the best analogies to same-sex marriage benefits, I think. What happens when a 25 year-old who hasn't been able to find a job and therefore has LESS income than a senior (who has had the opportunity to save money during his or her life, and STILL draws SS) says \"that's not fair to me that a senior who has been able to save money all his years gets federal benefits and I don't.\" Do we cave in and extend benefits to him to?

That's the kind of thing that send gay rights people into a hot frenzy if a non-gay rights person said it. In other posts you've argued that you really only want equal treatment, not just benefits another way. It's marriage or nothing. With handicapped people, the ONLY way to help them is to give them special allowances like ramps, wider doorways, closer parking, etc. Gay people are indeed asking for special rights here in that they are asking for the special right of getting benefits outside of the way society sees marriage. But if gay eopel simply want benefits, many can already be gotten in other ways, and it can be done in ways outside of broadening marriage to include other groups. If gay people were wanting the analogous equivilent of closer parking or wider doorways, they wouldn't need to have the \"M\" word for that.",

Instead of providing even a single reason that we should disallow same-sex marriage or why my logic was wrong, you provided reasoning suggesting that we should end social security because it provides preferrential treatment. Yet in the case of social security, we give benefits to the elderly because they are unable to work. If a 25-year-old is unable to work, I would not be opposed to granting that individual benefits in order to accomodate his disadvantage. If an individual lives in an area without jobs, that individual is still able to move someone else to find work, and a better solution is to use our money to create new jobs, not to fund a perfectly capable worker for doing nothing. So my conclusion is that this 25-year-old is not as disadvantaged as an elderly individual, nor is the best solution to this problem to provide benefits. Remember: providing preferrential treatment is wrong; we should avoid it wherever possible.\n \n Now translating this situation to same-sex and opposite-sex couples, we are currently providing benefits to the most advantaged people, not the least. This simply makes no sense in relation to social security, which is clearly designed to provide benefits for people with some sort of disadvantage. There is no reason that opposite-sex couples are deserving of special benefits not granted to same-sex couples, and that is what you must address if you are to make a valid argument.\n \n \nSo you compare homosexuality to a handicap? That's the kind of thing that send gay rights people into a hot frenzy if a non-gay rights person said it. In other posts you've argued that you really only want equal treatment, not just benefits another way. It's marriage or nothing.\n\n \n Come on now, that's not what I said at all. The point of my posts was that handicapped people are disadvantaged while opposite-sex couples are not disadvantaged. The claim that this was somehow a comparison of homosexuality to a handicap is absurd. I did nothing of the sort. I did suggest that homosexuals face a harder time in society, but my conclusion was clearly \"neither group does deserve benefits over the other\", which is very different from my conclusion about handicapped people. In both previous threads and this thread, I argued that I only want equal treatment, not benefits another way.\n \n Also, it's not marriage or nothing, it's simply \"the same rights\" with no \"or\" to be seen.\n \n \nWith handicapped people, the ONLY way to help them is to give them special allowances like ramps, wider doorways, closer parking, etc. Gay people are indeed asking for special rights here in that they are asking for the special right of getting benefits outside of the way society sees marriage. But if gay eopel simply want benefits, many can already be gotten in other ways, and it can be done in ways outside of broadening marriage to include other groups. If gay people were wanting the analogous equivilent of closer parking or wider doorways, they wouldn't need to have the \"M\" word for that.\n\n \n If gay people are asking for special benefits outside of the way society sees marriage, then we can only determine that society believes straight people should get special benefits. If gay people asking for same-sex marriage is gay people asking for special benefits, then the only logical conclusion is that straight people already have special benefits.\n \n Anyhow, you misinterpreted what I was saying. Gay people are not asking for closer parking or wider doorways. Straight people already get the closest parking and the straight person doorways. Gay people are asking for nothing more than the right to use those close parking spots and those doorways. They simply want the same benefits that heterosexuals get. You thought that I was comparing homosexuals to handicapped people, but I was actually comparing heterosexuals to handicapped people. Both straight people and handicapped people get benefits. Which group actually deserves those special benefits, and which one just wants to have more?",

Why should you be given couple's benefits any more than, say, the 25 year-old jobless man who can't get one, and has no money be given social security?\n\n \n You're right; some jobless adult could complain that he deserves monetary benefits just as much as a person on social security. And he may have a point. But my point is that if this jobless guy is actually right, if he is actually disadvantaged as much as someone recieving special treatment, then he should not be denied that special treatment. That is why we have welfare and unemployment compensation. An unemployed person actually is disadvantaged. Some would argue that there are better ways to handle that disadvantage, perhaps.\n \n To answer the question about why a 25-year-old jobless man shouldn't get couples benefits, it's because couple's benefits are designed to address the specific needs of a couple. They deal with property rights between two people, adding people as a dependant on your tax forms, hospital visitation rights, extra coverage of a spouse. These aren't things that an unemployed person needs; they're things that a family needs.\n \n And a same-sex couple has just as much needs for those family benefits as an opposite-sex couple. That is what matters. When you say, \"anyone could come along and claim social security is unfair too\", it sounds like you mean that if someone comes along with a valid claim about how our system is unfair, then we should do nothing to stop it. It sounds like you're just agreeing that we'll always be unfair and that's okay. It really is not okay. We need to try to be fair to everyone, we need to try to treat everyone equally.\n \n \nNo, rather marriage is an opposite-sex institution. It really has nothing to do with the people involved, but rather the institution. If you want couple's benefits, you should find another means to an end rather than taking on an institution that society sees differently than you.\n\n \n I will not stand for any discriminatory institution. If society thought \"marriage\" was a same-race institution, I would work to either change that institution or remove that institution from our laws. What would you do? Create \"civil unions\" for interracial couples? That is horrible; interracial couples should have access to the exact same rights as same-race couples.\n \n I do not care what society thinks marriage is; I'm going to work to give same-sex couples the same rights under the law just as I would work to give interracial couples the same rights under the law. Society can think \"marriage\" is between whomever they please, but as soon as they start restricting access to legal institutions or benefits without just cause, they are wrong.\n \n \nAgreed that's what they are asking for (although not an accurate way to analogize it), and that's one reason the handicapp issue is not really a good analogy, IMO.\n\n \n I'm not certain why you think this isn't an accurate way to analogize the situation. Is it not true that opposite-sex couples get special benefits? Don't they get the close parking spots and the special doors? Aren't same-sex couples just asking to be allowed to use the same parking spots and the same doors?\n \n According to you, the definition of a \"close parking spot\" is \"a parking spot that is close to a store where a heterosexual parks his car\". All I'm asking is that you change the definition to be \"a parking spot that is close to a store where people can park regardless of sexual orientation\". I'm asking that you remove a restriction that prevents same-sex couples from getting the same benefits you have. Why do you deserve a close parking spot any more than a homosexual?",

   "That is probably true; though the fact that they are elected does not impose on you, the laws that they pass very well may.\n\n In my house, Democrat almost always has an adjective modifier \"damn\". :) \n \n\n I am opposed to affirmative action, and senior citizen discounts isn't the best example, as that tends to be an individual business choice, not a government law. But there are some cases where I approve of preferrential treatment: social security, for example, or special handicapped benefits.\n\n OK, how about a senior prescription plans that'll cost us $1Trillion over the next 20 years?\n \n\n But aren't those preferrential treatments harmful as well? The answer is: yes. By giving special benefits to the elderly or to handicapped people, we are creating a harm. However, that sort of preferrential treatment does not deny equality. \n\n But it does. For instance, to pay for those programs, those with higher incomes are forced to pay an UNEQUAL amount of the bill. \n \n\n Social security is designed to supplement the elderly with an income during a period of their life when they are less able to bring in an income. Handicapped benefits are designed to ease the burden of travelling felt by handicapped people.\n\n SS created a mindset which rewarded people for NOT planning for their own retirement and instead, allowed them to live beyond their means up until retirement and then off of others after retirement.\n \n\n Handicapped benefits are a great example, I think. We don't just throw money at handicapped people, we give them special parking spots and pass laws to assure they have access to buildings. We try to make their lives as easy as the next man's, not easier. Handicapped people and the elderly have special needs, and we give them benefits to address those needs. Perhaps the most important thing I can say is that if some other group of people is found to have the same special disadvantages and needs of handicapped people, we should give that other group the same special benefits. Such is the case of same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples\n We do not give opposite-sex couples benefits because they have some special need for those benefits, we give them benefits because the majority wants to give themselves benefits. We give them benefits not because they are disadvantaged but because the majority wants to control people's lives, wants to teach people that homosexuality is wrong, when they have no place putting that teaching into law. \n\n Huh? You don't really believe that marriage benefits were granted just to punish homosexuals do you? emoticon_confused \n If you look at the history of the laws, you'll see that they were enacted in order to promote marriage and nuclear families. Now, you can argue, and rightfully so IMO, that the Federal gov't has no business being involved in social engineering, but the desired goal was to promote marriage NOT to punish gays. I'd venture a guess that gays weren't even considered in the equation.\n \n\n If either group deserved benefits over the other, it would be the group facing a more difficult time in our society, same-sex couples (though neither group does deserve benefits over the other). \n\n Convicted felons also face a more difficult time in our society, should we reward them as well? Your logic is flawed. If I face difficulty because of MY OWN ACTIONS, why should anyone else care?\n \n\n Giving opposite-sex couples benefits is equivalent to giving benefits to white people; white people don't need benefits. They already live better than anyone\n\n Wow! emoticon_wow Now that's a gross racially-based generalization and not true to boot. There are far more poor whites in the US than poor blacks. Check out the census site some time if you don't believe me. \n \n\n I see your point, so let me first address the question as you intended it. In the case of the wealthy, they are the most advantaged in society. Everyone below them faces additional need. In order to accomodate that need, it is acceptable to give benefits to those with lower incomes. It can be acceptable to give people who face a greater disadvantage, those who are less wealthy, benefits not held by those who are more wealthy. But in direct answer to your question: yes. It is wrong to benefit any person over another. The question is whether it is more wrong to allow the disadvantage faced by lower-income individuals to remain. In my opinion, it is more wrong to do that, and the lesser of two wrongs becomes the moral thing to do. But if I did not make it clear above, let me do it now: it is wrong to benefit one person over another.\n \n Now, I should also mention that the wealthy are a special case. The wealthy are made wealthy because of the laws already in existence in our nation. Our current set of laws, the laws that form capitalism, are laws that benefit people with ingenuity, people willing to take risks, sometimes people willing to step on others, people who are hard workers, and people who are well-educated. It also benefits people who already have money over people who don't. If our government had instituted some other system, it could instead be the smartest people, those who contribute most to society, those who are the most kind and caring, and those who are the most generous that are elevated to the top. There is not really a good reason that those people shouldn't be elevated, if we're going to elevate someone.\n \n But we choose capitalism because that provides us with the best economy, the most income, the strongest nation. We choose it knowing that we're going to elevate those who will become wealthy over everyone else. But just because capitalism is going to elevate some people over many people in terms of wealth, that doesn't mean that those people should be elevated over everyone else. And if it is possible to maintain the benefits of capitalism without elevating those people over everyone else, it is our responsibility to create a government that doesn't elevate those people. If removing that inequality destroys capitalism's benefits, then perhaps minimizing that equality is the best we can do.\n\n So, your position is that it's OK to treat wealthy people inequally because not doing so cause a greater hardship to the poorer in society? Well, given the fact that gays have a higher income level than the average Joe, by your logic, it's OK to treat them inequitably. Thanks for the support. :) \n \n\n The wealthy are a special case, as I said.\n\n Including wealthy gays, right? \n \n\n I'm not certain what you mean here. I would argue that an individual's moral opinion is protected by the Constitution. I wouldn't necessarily say that homosexuality is protected by the Constitution; that's up for debate. But those things aren't important in the discussion of gay rights; whether the Constitution protects homosexuality or same-sex marriage does not indicate whether homosexuality or same-sex marriage is actually morally right or wrong.\n \n\n \n That's true. The Constitution isn't a \"moral authority\" so to speak. \n \n\n My point in the paragraph you're responding to was not that people don't currently have the right to vote on morality in a purely democratic process. Surely the Constitution allows states to decide how to determine such issues, and most states have allowed for a purely democratic process. But I do not believe that determining those things through a purely democratic process, a direct vote of the people, is ever a good idea. Morality and civil rights are the worst things you can leave up to the whim of the majority because the majority will too often deny the rights of the minority. The majority does not often understand freedom. In morality and civil rights, as in anything, the power of the majority should be checked by the government, just as the power of the government should be checked by the majority.\n\n \n Your logic is faulty. Morality is the domain of the majority. It is a society's obligation to set standards of public behavior that are acceptable to the majority. And civil rights are certainly issues that get settled by the majority. Constitutional Amendments, for example, require majority support in a majority of states. And the power of the government is granted BECAUSE of the majority that voted them into office. Laws that are created, but have no widespread public support, are repressive and should be changed ASAP.",

The numbers of poor whites are irrelevant; those white people are not poor because of their skin color.

You tried to tie together race and wealth above, now you try to tie together sexual orientation and wealth here. But there are poor people of all races and all sexual orientations. It is acceptable to take more money from wealthy people because of our government, and if gay people are more often wealthy, then we would be taking more money from gay people. But by denying same-sex marriage, we are denying benefits to both poor and wealthy gay people. It does not make any sense whatsoever to deny benefits to the poor people simply because people they've never met are bringing up the \"average wealth\" for some arbitrary group that they happen to belong to.\n \n \nIncluding wealthy gays, right?\n\n \n Right.\n \n \nYour logic is faulty.

Every country is bound by tradition and culture held by its inhabitants, and liberalism may not end up on top in a nation where the majority is content to allow the minority to suffer. There has been greed long before America, and it will last long after. America has simply instituted Capitalism and representative democracy, systems which use greed to the advantage of everyone, which make the greedy work, in order to satisfy that greed. The real problems in America come from those who have been trained to believe that democracy is the answer to everything, that somehow if the majority agrees with something, that makes it right. That belief is already beginning to lead to the destruction of representative demcracy and the institution of pure democracy. Perhaps another problem is our tendency to blame people unlike ourselves. We call people at the top corrupt and part of a \"moral rot\" when they are generally trying to be good people. I would much prefer if we understood that most people have good intentions, and treated them as such.",

   "JPSartre, I think you should realize that the liberal side of things does not always want to see increased control of people's lives by the government. I certainly do not; I want to see just the opposite. But I'm more concerned with decreasing the government's control on social issues than on economic ones. By definition, liberals want the government to have less control over the social issues people face, and they want more government services. By definition, conservatives want less government services but more control over the social aspects of people's lives.\n \n Denying same-sex marriage is a perfect example of the government imposing itself on people's lives. The government is providing special benefits for some people but not for others. It is promoting one lifestyle over another. It is distributing tax dollars unevenly. It is benefiting one lifestyle choice over another, and that is precisely what social control is.\n \n If you subscribe to Jeffersonian political views; then you should understand that same-sex marriage does not harm you in any fashion. It does not impose on you. But denying it imposes on those people who wish to engage in it. I do believe that if Jefferson were born in this generation, he would be strongly in support of same-sex marriage. I do admire Jefferson myself, though I tend to be more in agreement with Hamilton and Madison on the Federal vs. Local government issues.",

The courts have overstepped their authority and the public responded by initiating ballot issues specifically addressing gay marriage.

   "JPSartre, I think you should realize that the liberal side of things does not always want to see increased control of people's lives by the government. I certainly do not; I want to see just the opposite. But I'm more concerned with decreasing the government's control on social issues than on economic ones. By definition, liberals want the government to have less control over the social issues people face, and they want more government services. By definition, conservatives want less government services but more control over the social aspects of people's lives.\n\n I don't agree with either of your assessments. If liberals didn't want increased control over people's lives, why are they pushing for gun control, hate crime legislation, reduced free speech on college campuses, anti-tobacco legislation and lawsuits, governmental monopoly on education, healthcare, social security, etc.? All of those are designed to INCREASE government's control of our lives and all are liberal initiatives.\n And when it comes to conservatives, I think that you paint with too broad a brush. Not all conservatives want increased control of people's lives. I'm against all forms of censorship, except those that protect minors. I'm against anti-drug laws. I'm against \"blue laws\". I'm against laws that regulate behavior between consenting adults, which includes prostitution, pornography and homosexuality. We're not monolithic in our beliefs. I don't want to be controlled by the Right OR Left.\n \n\n Denying same-sex marriage is a perfect example of the government imposing itself on people's lives. The government is providing special benefits for some people but not for others. It is promoting one lifestyle over another. It is distributing tax dollars unevenly. It is benefiting one lifestyle choice over another, and that is precisely what social control is..\n\n I agree with the problem statement, but not the solution. The solution isn't to redefine marriage, it's to grant equality. I can't turn a dog into a cat, but I can treat them both fairly.\n \n\n If you subscribe to Jeffersonian political views; then you should understand that same-sex marriage does not harm you in any fashion. It does not impose on you. But denying it imposes on those people who wish to engage in it. I do believe that if Jefferson were born in this generation, he would be strongly in support of same-sex marriage. I do admire Jefferson myself, though I tend to be more in agreement with Hamilton and Madison on the Federal vs. Local government issues.\n\n If Jefferson were alive and in power in this era, there wouldn't be the vast social net that exists and NOBODY would be sucking off the governmental teat. And you'd be wrong about Jefferson's view on same-sex marriage. Jefferson once authored a bill that advocated emasculation as the penalty for homosexuality in his home state of Virginia, so I doubt that he'd be a strong supporter of your movement. :) emoticon_wow",

Check it out. \n \n\n BIOMETRIC DEBIT CARD REPLACES FOOD STAMPS\n By Jon Christian Ryter\n June 30, 2004\n NewsWithViews.com\n Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman announced the \"end of an era\" this week with the full-blown introduction of new electronic benefits transfer debit cards that will replace, forever, the old-fashioned 20th century paper food stamp coupons. Veneman called the coupons an embarrassing stigma on those forced to rely on them. \"This month,\" Veneman said as the new biometric debit card program was officially launched nationwide, \"the food stamp program arrived in the 21st century. States are destroying the paper coupons, and we don't anticipate that we'll ever have them printed again.\"\n \n As Veneman noted, food stamp recipients like the debit cards (which resemble the traditional credit or debit swipe cards that are being used, increasingly, in America's supermarkets). The swipe cards avoid the embarrassment felt by food stamp users who call attention to themselves by tearing coupons out of the food stamp books in the supermarket checkout lines in front of the other customers. There is a poverty stigma attached to the use of food stamps that the new program hopes to eliminate.\n \n Grocers like the program's technology better because the food stamp customers are processed through the checkout at the same rate of speed as any other credit or debit card user and because the stores are reimbursed faster since the electronic transactions are credited their bank accounts within 48 hours. State administrators like the new program because, they claim, the debit cards will help reduce the theft of coupon books and, more than anything else, they will stop the fraudulent use of food stamps. In the past food stamps have been sold on the black market and used as a second form of US currency to buy illegal drugs and other forms of contraband that is bought and sold on the black market. \n http://www.newswithviews.com/Ryter/jon46.htm \n\n \n Is that anecdotal?\n \n\n The tensions weren't from one side.\n\n We never had a riot in my previous \"almost all white school\" so you tell me? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n So those blacks should all be grateful to you? That's one of the oldest arguments in the book, to say some of your best friends belong to a minority, so therefore you can't be bigoted! \n\n You missed the part about living on the minority campus for 4 years. And tell me, how many blacks have you had over for dinner? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n There will be more court challenges if legislatures don't act.\n\n Agreed. That's why I believe a Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage is almost inevitable.\n \n\n Hey, don't forget to blame liberals for global warming, Britney Spears' last album, reality TV, tornadoes, flooding, and anything else you don't like.\n\n Don't quit your day job.

   "It known as an analogy. The illegality of polygamy is irrelevant. You just don't know how to deal with the parallels.\n\n \n Well, I love analogies myself, and I've talked in the past about the differences between homosexuality and polygamy that I believe differentiate the two and make one worth legalizing and one harmful to legalize.\n \n But one thing I do want to point out about this analogy is that it is never used to show why same-sex marriage shouldn't be allowed. It seems like all the analogy says is, \"Polygamous marriage should be legalized too\" or \"You should be working for polygamy too.\" I mean, even if that is true, that still doesn't say anything about same-sex marriage.\n \n The problem is that the analogy doesn't actually list any problems with polygamy. When I compare same-sex marriage to interracial marriage, I say \"denying interracial marriage treats people who love someone of a different race unfairly; in the same fashion, denying same-sex marriage treats people who love someone of the same sex unfairly.\" In the case of the polygamy analogy, all that is ever said is \"if you support same-sex marriage, you should support polygamy too.\" In my analogy, I pointed out a common harm between denying same-sex and interracial marriage. In the polygamy analogy, no harm of polygamy or same-sex marriage is ever listed.\n \n Because no harm of polygamy is ever listed, it is impossible to say whether that harm does or doesn't apply to same-sex marriage.

   "Given the fact that Jefferson not only championed the separation of church and state, but had particular contempt for Paul, the author of those much misinterpreted, out of context New Testament passages used by fundies to justify discrimination towards gays, whom he derided as \"the first corruptor\" of the teachings of Christ, it's ludicrous to suggest he would have supported the arguments of anti-gay posters on this board. \n\n Out of context New Testament passages? That's a good one. Mind if I use it when I run out of comedic material? :) \n Jefferson wrote: \"Of all the systems of morality, ancient or modern, which have come under my observation, none appears to me so pure as that of Jesus.\" (Letter to W. Canby, September 18, 1813.) \n \"Peace, prosperity, liberty and morals have an intimate connection.\" --Thomas Jefferson to George Logan, 1813. ME 13:384 \n \n\n Jefferson held science and rationality above all--certainly above the presumed motives of a supernatural deity--and would undeniably have been guided by the findings of researchers showing homosexuality to be a harmless, naturally-occurring sexual variant, which of course scientists in his time were worlds away from discovering. (No unkerpaulie, he.) \n \n\n Oh really? Here's what Jefferson wrote about morality and its relationship to science\n \n\n \"He who made us would have been a pitiful bungler, if he had made the rules of our moral conduct a matter of science. For one man of science, there are thousands who are not. What would have become of them? Man was destined for society. His morality, therefore, was to be formed to this object. He was endowed with a sense of right and wrong merely relative to this. This sense is as much a part of his nature, as the sense of hearing, seeing, feeling; it is the true foundation of morality... The moral sense, or conscience, is as much a part of man as his leg or arm. It is given to all human beings in a stronger or weaker degree, as force of members is given them in a greater or less degree. It may be strengthened by exercise, as may any particular limb of the body. This sense is submitted indeed in some degree to the guidance of reason; but it is a small stock which is required for this: even a less one than what we call Common sense. State a moral case to a ploughman and a professor. The former will decide it as well, and often better than the latter, because he has not been led astray by artificial rules.\" --Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr, 1787. ME 6:257, Papers 12:15 \n \n\n So, once again, the assertion that Jefferson would be pro-gay because he was \"a man of science\" is ludicrous. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n His recommendation of castration for homosexuals in is time was actually a step forward for gays of his day, as the previous sentence was death.\n\n Oh why hell, that's almost an endorsement, right? emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes",

Here's what Jefferson wrote about morality and its relationship to science\n\n \n Modern liberals sometimes try to take partial writings of founders like Jefferson, and remake them into their own image. Just because science changes doesn't mean that these men would change in terms of their moral and ethical thinking. There is no reason to think that Jefferson would have suddenly taken on a situational and relativistic morality in OUR time, especially since genetic disposition toward something doesn't determine whether it is right or wrong.\n \n But it won't surprise me if those who try to put Jefferson in their back pocket (like a square peg in a round hole) here will soon be posting snippet and snippet of quotes from Jefferson, as if we should ignore the bulk and general context of his writings as a whole. \n \n I only wish modern liberals WERE like Jefferson.",

   "Then why do a number of you argue against it, and seem to want to distance \n your movement from the issue of polygamy?\n\n \n It is not us who want to distance ourselves from it; it is you same-sex marriage oppoents who wish to present it as the same thing as same-sex marriage. You present an analogy trying to relate them, and I say, \"No, here's how we're different.\" That's not me going out of my way to distance the two; that's me refuting your analogy.\n \n \nAt the very least, the polygamy parallel reveals inconsistency in the gay rights argument.

Yet there are quite a few of you it seems who feel marriage shouldn't be a fully equal institution it seems.\n\n \n See, the problem is that harm is a factor, and polygamous marriage is a removal of equality. I have no problem allowing people to engage in polygamous relationships, and I have no problem with them extending benefits to a single other person, and I have no problem calling that a \"marriage\" or anything else. But the harm comes into play because it's impractical to grant a single person the power to bestow benefits to infinite other people. Our government cannot and should not fund that many benefits. Furthermore, it really isn't equality to allow one person to extend benefits to several people while another extends them only to one. That person extending them to only one person must pay additional tax money to fund those benefits. The argument I have just listed has nothing to do with my argument in support of same-sex marriage; that harm is nonexistant in the case of same-sex marriage.\n \n Read again the paragraph above. No one ever, ever responds to the harms I've listed there. They simply pretend they don't exist.\n \n \nAlso there is the issue of precedent. Polygamy is, by any reasonable observation, another relationship arrangement just like same-gender couples. Whether or not people come forward wanting polygamy recognition is beside the point--if we are now going to be about the business of broadening the definition of marriage as your movement seeks, then there needs to be a thoughtful discussion on the limits or non-limits of the extent of marriage freedom.\n\n \n We absolutely should have a thoughtful discussion on the limits and non-limits of the extend of marriage freedom. But I'm the only one who is engaging in that discussion. I'm the one stating in specific terms the exact harms of polygamous marriage. I am aware that you also oppose polygamous marriage. So why am I the only one listing the harms? Tell me what harm comes from polygamous marriage. Once we determine that, then we can determine whether that same harm applies to same-sex marriage. If they do, then your comparison may have some accuracy. If they don't; it is very possible to oppose polygamous marriage but support same-sex marriage.\n \n I've listed harms of polygamous marriage that don't apply to same-sex marriage. My line of reasoning is not broken.\n \n \nThe goal here is not to legalize polygamy--it is to show that gay marriage is not an non-influencial island in and of itself when it comes to setting precendents in our society, and to show the inconsistencies in arguments for equality.\n\n \n I am aware that the goal is not to legalize polygamy. But you cannot attack same-sex marriage using polygamy as an example unless you show a common harm between them.\n \n To simplify my argument, I am saying \"Polygamous marriage is harmful, and here's why. Same-sex marriage is not harmful.\" You are saying \"Neither polygamous marriage nor same-sex marriage is harmful.\" That statement doesn't attack same-sex marriage at all. You have to say, \"Polygamous marriage is harmful, and same-sex marriage is harmful in the same way\". \n \n Furthermore, when you say that polygamous marriage isn't harmful, you ignore the specific harms that I have listed every time. As far as I can tell, the inconsistancies in my position are caused primarily by ignoring large portions of what I've said.",

How is that harmful? The govt. already grants benefits to groups of 2 in a marriage. Are you thinking only in terms of religious patriarchal-type polygamy?\n\n \n No no, I mean... Let me explain: under our current version of marriage, one individual can extend his health care benefits to his spouse and the children of his spouses. If we grant the benefits of marriage in a polygamous fashion, that individual could extend his health care benefits to countless spouses and all of their children. Further, an individual can count his spouses and children as dependants for calculating taxes. Again, this would enable him to include countless people as dependants. Further, an individual can natrualize his or her spouse, if that spouse is an immigrant.

   "A predictable response. It still doesn't prove that it EVER will. Perhaps you would like to share how long you believe it will be before your scare tactics become reality, as long as we are fantasizing? \n\n There are many of us that wouldn't have envisioned anyone wanting to marry a member of the same sex, either. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n Some similarities, some differences. For example both Canada and the U.S. use the common law definition of marriage. It was the courts in provinces that changed defintions of marriage. The federal government chose to accept the rulings. Of course, Canada and the U.S. don't have the same Constitution. None of this shows us how same-sex marriage will lead to polygamous marriages in the U.S.\n\n I didn't say it would lead to them, only that it would open the door for others to redefine marriage. They just happen to be one such group.\n \n\n Some may, just like some heterosexual men may want to marry more than one woman to suit his mood. This is not what being a bi-sexual or heterosexual is generally about, however. \n\n Legal menage a trois?\n \n\n Indeed, they have. All those groups have been considered on their own merits, not on the basis of fear tactics. \n\n There are many that don't want to open that box. I'm amongst that group.\n \n\n We can and do make distinctions. We may change one, but that doesn't mean we must change all others as a result. Again you argue for polygamy, not for the \"two person\" definition.\n\n And again, you want selective redefinition to suit ONLY your goals.\n \n\n Perahps, perhaps not. My lack of consideration, if it is that, concerning polygamists, is not the issue. \n \n\n You want a self-serving redefinition of marriage but aren't willing to consider other possibilities. \n \n\n No, each considered re-definiton, is, and should be, considered on its own merits.\n\n \n Why have to go through it more than once?

Either there are some restrictions or there aren't.\n\n \n First of all, I don't think I said that I supported the government granting marriage benefits for everyone. I asked you how you could possibly come to the conclusion that we should leave marriage only for heterosexuals, when you stated in the previous sentence that the government should grant benefits to everyone or no one.\n \n Second, it is my belief that the government already grants marriage benefits to polygamous couples; they can choose a single person to grant those benefits to, just like any other couple.\n \n You know where I stand on the issue; now I ask you why you stand where you do. You stated this:\n \n \nThe solution is that marriage should not be broadened in the first place. It opens a pandora's box that only gets bigger. Instead the govt. should either remove marriage benefits altogether or find a way to extend them to every possible relationship arrangement that comes along. Or even better, marriage should continue being an institution between a man and a woman as it truly is.\n\n \n I asked this:\n \n \nBut it is really a pandora's box?

How can you possibly come to that conclusion?\n \n I also asked: how is it that you can support opposite-sex marriage, but not polygamous marriage? If you believe that I cannot support two-person marriage without also supporting polygamous marriage, why is it that you can support opposite-sex marriage without supporting polygamous marriage?

Reilly at the county courthouse in Doylestown on Monday. Reilly told the men that it would be illegal for her to sign the license, but later stated that they were entitled to judicial review of their application. \n\n \n\n Same-sex marriages already are illegal under Mississippi law.\n http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040714/NEWS01/407140356/1002\n \n\n \n\n Couple Denied Marriage License\n As expected they were turned away because gay marriage is illegal in Ohio.\n \n Couples across the country flooded marriage bureaus to tie the knot on Valentine's day but many were turned away. Tom and John Meinecke showed up at the Lucas County courthouse early this morning to file for a marriage license. As expected they were turned away because gay marriage is illegal in Ohio. The couple has tried three in years in a row and say they'll continue their fight.\n \n Dr. Tom Meinecke a gay rights activist says \"we have to start treating people equally. There should be no line drawn, no separation. We're all people and we have to live together.\"\n \n Back in November Ohio voters overwhelming approved a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.

There's not a single right you don't have that single straight people in relationships don't have as well. It's not THAT big a deal if the commitment is the basis of the relationship and not the benefits.\n\n \n Are you married? If so, I ask that you get a legal divorce and stay religiously married. The only man who can say that legal marriage benefits do not matter is one who could take them for himself but decides not to. The truth is that marriage benefits do help married couples. And same-sex couples are treated worse than opposite-sex couples because they are not given these benefits. They are not given benefits that would help them out without harming anyone else. So how do you want me to describe the problem caused by denying benefits to same-sex couples that would help them if not by using the term \"harm\"? I think \"harm\" accurately describes the situation.\n \n It's true that I have the same rights as a straight person. But it's also true that my right to marriage includes the clause \"but you only get this if you stop being homosexual.\" It is a battle of civil rights, not in the sense that people are directly denied a right; it is a battle of civil rights in that people are denied a right unless they conform. Gay people are denied a right unless they stop being gay, unless they live the way the government demands. This restriction on marriage is designed specifically to prevent gay people from getting married, and it is for all intents and purposes a denial of a right to gay people. In the same way, saying Christians aren't allowed to marry would be denying a right to Christians, even though technically \"everyone has the right to marry so long as they stop being Christian\".\n \n Now it may not be a big deal to you that some people aren't treated fairly, but it's a big deal to me. It does not matter to me that a lot of gay people live better than some striaght people; a lot of gay people are not living better.

I would have no problem whatsoever with you getting the benefits you need through some other means, even a new govt. initiative of some sort. But I do have a problem with you trying to use an opposite-sex institution to do it.\n\n \n Marriage is a legal institution. It is precisely what the government decides it to be. You might have some religious version of marriage, and I have something different, but we're not talking about that version at all. We're talking about a legal institution, and the only definition of a legal instition is precisely what the government decides it to be.\n \n Now I don't disagree that the legal institution called \"marriage\" is an opposite-sex institution today. But I'm saying \"we should change that, and here are the reasons why\". You just responded with \"we should keep marriage an opposite-sex institution because it's an opposite-sex institution\". Surely you must realize that such an argument does not make sense.\n \n \nNot really--the law isn't so much designed for the purpose of excluding gay people as it is to simply support the institution as it is--opposite-sex. The law doesn't point out any one group to exclude, but rather is written in such a way that supports marriage as a one-husband and one-wife institution, and any other arrangements in gender or number or anything else is outside that definition. (That of course includes gay relationships.)\n\n \n By creating marriage as a union between one man and one woman, we have created restrictions on marriage. Whether you view those restrictions as intended to support one-man and one-woman relationships is irrelevant to the fact that the restriction by design keeps out homosexuals. And this is precisely the problem. Our law strengthens heterosexual unions while failing to strengthen homosexual unions. Our law treats heterosexuals better than homosexuals. Our law is designed to be exclusive, to elevate one group over the rest. But there is no reason to elevate opposite-sex couples over same-sex couples, and that is precisely the problem.\n \n \nBut Christians aren't trying to change society's view (or go against it) of marriage. That's the difference. They aren't trying to redefine anything. And they are marrying in a way that fits what marriage is.\n\n \n But there is no problem with redefining a legal institution if failing to redesign that institution is evil. I am trying to change society's view because society's view is causing people to be treated unfairly. Society's view is hurting people. Christians don't deserve extra benefits simply because there are more Christians. Everyone deserves benefits.\n \n \nYou are denied the same benefits as any group out there that's not partaking in marriage in the way that marriage is--one man with one woman. I have no problem with you getting whatever benefits you need, but not via marriage.\n\n \n You're right; I am denied the same benefits as any group out there that's not partaking in marriage in the way that marriage is. And I have no problem with you getting the benefits you need, but only so long as homosexuals get them too. But what I do not understand is why you do not support same-sex couples having marriage. All I see is the same statement over and over: we should not change marriage because marriage is currently unchanged. That is nothing more than circular logic.

Inheritance and survivor benefits can be obtained if civil unions are enacted. You don't need \"marriage\" for that, just the consent of the governed. Something that you won't get if you insist on calling it marriage. :)\n\n \n No one's insisting on calling it anything, so long as it's called the same thing for everyone. Isn't it true that if same-sex couples don't need marriage, then neither do opposite-sex couples? It remains absurd to claim that you deserve a special title.\n \n If it is harms of a special title you are looking for, then let me explain. Having a special title of marriage is actually creating a seperate legal institution. There is no reason to believe that two seperate legal institutions should remain the same. Any future politician could easily create a bill that applies to marriage but not civil unions, and any governor could line-item-veto benefits to civil unions from a bill. Because of our culture today, it would be very surprising to see these things remain equal.\n \n Beyond that, granting a special title to opposite-sex couples teaches people something. There is a certain understanding of what \"marriage\" is, and so long as our law grants it to opposite-sex couples but not same-sex couples, it is teaching everyone that same-sex couples are not as good as opposite-sex couples.\n \n We have never before created two institutions to do exactly the same thing. Imagine, for example, if men held the right to vote while women held \"civil ballot-casting\". Even if the two were the same thing, really, our government would be teaching people that the vote of a woman is not of the same worth as a vote of a man. In the case of a true minority, this will become even worse. Even if the names are changed from \"marriage\" and \"civil unions\" to something else, so long as the people are seperated in rights, our government will be teaching a disapproval of the minority group.\n \n So keeping these things in mind, consider why opposite-sex couples deserve a special title. Why do they deserve a special legal institution under the law? Isn't the only reason to seperate those you approve of from those you disapprove of? I ask that you do not respond with a message of how same-sex marriage would never be approved by the people; that does not imply anything about the morality of giving opposite-sex couples an exclusive legal institution.",

Or if it is, tell me how I've missed it. Are you trying to say that \"marriage\" simpy doesn't apply to same-sex couples? If not, would you be willing to change the name of the legal-side of the institution so we could all use the same institution?

Hitler was one of those people. He denied Jews and gypsies, and many others the right to life, simply because of his beliefs. He was well-intentioned, but harming others because of his beliefs didn't make him right, it made him a monster. Others have used their beliefs to give less to minority races, to women, to Communists, to atheists, to Native Americans, or to people of a neighboring nation. In each time, they are not justified in giving less to those people or treating them worse in any way.\n \n So why are you right today? Is it because instead of denying life, you're denying only a title, only a single legal institution? Well that does make you better than the rest, but it doesn't make you right.\n \n Any who would say you are as bad as Hitler is wrong. But any who would suggest that you committed a similar wrong, abliet in very different extremes, would have a rational justification for that claim.\n \n Granting less than the same rights with the same names is wrong. But even with the claim that you will support civil unions, it feels more like a desire to make yourselves feel good than a desire to help people who need it. I could be wrong on this, but I never see anyone who supports only civil unions speaking out in favor of civil unions. I never see them standing up for gay rights. I've never seen them argue with gay rights opponents. Did Voice of Reason support civil unions? I don't think he did; yet he became your ally instead of your enemy. Instead, those people are voting in favor of laws that ban both marriage and civil unions.\n \n Does anyone really support civil unions? Or is it really just that those who claim to support them simply want to keep marriage for themselves, and nothing else matters? Shouldn't it be more important that same-sex couples have the legal rights that will help them? Why does it even matter if those legal rights have the same name as yours?",

   "[QUOTE=JakeCJB]\n\n \n That's avoiding the question, by a non-sequitor. You may not qualify for affirmative action, and there are reasons for that which may be good or bad. Whatever the case with affirmative action, it doesn't make the reasons same-sex couples don't qualify as spouses, good reasons.\n\n If you believe that AA was instituted for the betterment of minorities to improve society as a whole, then is it really unreasonable that the government would promote heterosexual family values as a means of bettering society as a whole? \n \n\n If it's so easy, with family members who don't approve never challenging, why do straight couples need these protections through marriage? These things must be important and require special extra protection.\n\n I can't honestly think of one person who that has said \"Man, I'm glad that I have special marriage rights\" to protect me against predatory family members. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n I must have missed where Bush was supporting a national institution of civil unions in the U.S. Maybe you could point out to me where he said this...or not. And don't tell me it's because gay people want marriage. There is and never has been anything stopping the straight majority from allowing the gay minority less than what it wants. That's what you are offering at any rate. You are saying accept less than what you want, or else we will give you less anyway. So what exactly is stopping the straight majority allowing gay people national civil unions? Could it be the same prejudice that doesn't allow legal same-sex marriage?\n\n Why do you insist on talking about Bush? It isn't my responsibility, nor inclination to defend his actions. I can only speak for my own. I agree with the man when I think he's right and curse at him when I think he's wrong, just like everybody else. \n To me, Bush is a social moderate and a fiscal liberal. Neither are positions that I, personally, find very appealing in a President. emoticon_mad \n But, the pragmatist in me thinks \"It COULD be worse. Kerry could be Predident\". :xcensored",

   "It isn't that I don't think Jyoshu would vote in favor of civil unions. It's that I don't think any civil union supporter in general really cares about the rights of gay couples. What matters is that they have their special marriage title, and gay people could have no rights for all they care. They never fight for civil unions, they never oppose people who don't support civil unions. Their support of civil unions is simply an attempt to make them feel good about giving themselves marriage, like they aren't really hurting anyone. But supporting people's rights requires more than that. If you think gay people deserve those rights, then help fight for them. Isn't that the most important thing? Isn't the welfare of gay couples more important than a word definition?\n\n \n As a Christian, I'm not about to go out and actively support homosexuality.

Or don't you think those posts harm gays just as much as being openly against civil unions?\n\n \n Well, I think Jyoshu doesn't contradict himself for the sake of lying; I think he just sometimes repeats certain popular conservative statements that aren't true (of course, there are popular liberal statements that aren't true either). Like the activist judges thing, for example, or gays aren't committed thing, etc. Sometimes people just haven't made the connection that their reasoning doesn't make sense. Debating is one of the toughest methods of revealing that to people; it is in a person's nature to defend himself from arguments that would show error in his judgement. So it isn't a surprise that contradictions may be repeated.\n \n In response to your second question, I do think that it is less harmful to make harmful posts, but to follow them with the statement \"but I support civil unions\" than it is to make them without that statement. This is because anyone hearing Jyoshu's words who agrees with them might still be willing to grant gay people more rights than they have today.

Somehow, all that's said is \"activist judges\", and even though that term doesn't mean what gay rights opponents generally use it to mean, they all somehow understand it.\n\n \n See above.

   "You'll have to ask somebody other than Jyoshu or me. :)\n\n \n Rule one of LGBT Rights Handbook: Don't talk about LGBT Rights Handbook.\n \n \nPrecisely. They want activism except when it's their oxen being gored.\n\n \n That sounds about right. I don't think we're arguing for or against activism; I think we're arguing in favor of good decisions and against bad ones. Simply because a judge made an activist decision doesn't make that judge a bad one, and simply because he made a strict constitutionalist decision doesn't make him a bad one. But either could make him a bad one if the decision itself was harmful.\n \n \nI would suggest that you pay close attention to Roberts confirmation hearing then. A judge isn't supposed to rule on his personal feelings or sense of altruism, he's governed by THE CONSTITUTION. Activism occurs when judges forget their duty is to uphold THE CONSTITUTION when deciding cases.\n\n \n Well, I will pay attention to the confirmation hearing of Roberts, but I don't expect to learn anything I don't already know. The hearing will be geared toward public opinion, not toward good political science.\n \n Also, activism is not when a judge rules based on his own personal feelings or sense of altruism. That definition was fabricated by people looking for a term to describe the judges they disagreed with. Activism involves ruling based on the opinions of the author and the spirit of the Constitution, not one's own personal feelings.\n \n It takes an activist judge to look at the words \"equal protection under the law\" and determine that this does not apply to marriage because the author never intended it to mean marriage. It takes a strict constitutionalist judge to interpret those words exactly as they are written. Activism is not a bad thing.\n \n \nOur Constitution was very specific in the powers that it gave to the judiciary, superlegislator wasn't included.\n\n \n Our Constitution was very specific in the powers that it gave to the legislature, and instituting marriage benefits or recognizing marriage in any fashion wasn't included. That doesn't mean it's a bad thing, and it doesn't mean the founders would be surprised. Our government is designed to feed off the greed for power held by all three branches of the government. Our founders knew that every branch would extend its powers beyond what it was granted, and it is designed to accomodate that, to protect people's freedoms nonetheless.\n \n Our Constitution does not give courts the power to act on altruism to protect people's rights, just as it does not give the legislature the power to create special rights or deny rights to anyone outside of the specific list described in the Constitution itself. Yet when the legislature and president act outside their power, the courts will follow. If you're going to judge each branch of government based on its adherence to the list of powers it was granted in the Constitution, then you'd better judge all three branches to be superlegislatures.\n \n Now, this doesn't mean that I approve of courts or Congress acting outside the authority granted them by the Constitution. But that isn't what happened in the case of same-sex marriage.\n \n \nSee above. I don't want altruism in the SCOTUS. I want a Constitutional scholar.\n\n \n Then you want someone who supports same-sex marriage and abortion, as near as I can tell. A scholar knows that the Constitution lists the governments powers, and the government gets no powers beyond those listed. A scholar knows what equal protection under the law means. Only an activist can look at the Constitution and find legal authority for the government to place a restriction on legal benefits based on sexual orientation, and only an activist can look at the Constitution and find legal authority to deny people the right to have an abortion. Whether those things are morally wrong or right, the government's authority to do those things simply is not there.",

But because it was worded so vaguely, there are no checks on it's protections trying to be applied to other irrelevant matters that come along. It seems that when it comes to gay rights, your movement had to scour the constitution and happened to find a historically irrelevant amendment that gay behavior could uncomfortably fit with, due to the vague wording. I think I've said this here before, but if the 14th amendment, with it's vague wording and completely irrelevant-to-gay-rights purpose is the best gay people can come up with for a legal basis, you're movement is on shaky ground indeed. The point is that it's certainly debatable whether the 14th is a compelling amendment to even apply to this situation. You've said it yourself: there were no marriage benefits when the 14th was written. Calling them 'protections' granted by an amendment written to give freed blacks the benefits of citizenship is tenuous, at best. Besides, they are no more \"protections\" than, say, social security or affirmative action--and if the law starts granting marriage benefits to everyone that comes along with any relationship arrangement based on the 14th, then we're going to have to apologize to 25-year old who can't get a job and needs the money that social security won't give him because he's too young.\n \n \nThen you want someone who supports same-sex marriage and abortion, as near as I can tell. \n \n \n With all due respect, Jaxian, you have begun speaking out of both sides of your mouth on this.

We're talking about equal protection, which just means removing a restriction on a benefit designed to prevent some people from using it. That isn't wildly activist, it is based on exactly what the Constitution says.\n \n \nBut again, part of the problem is that there are loopholes here, and gay activism is taking advantage of that.

I can assure you that even if there were no loophole, I would still be arguing in support of same-sex marriage. I should also say that the only immoral behavior I believe we are debating is the behavior in which one individual votes to restrict the rights of another without just cause. \n \n \nLet me also add this: there are a lot of people out there that feel the 14th amendment is too subjective in the way it was worded.

They are no more protections than, say, social security or affirmative action.\n\n \n You're right, if you take an activist viewpoint, if you try to interpret why the amendment was written.\n \n Well, let me explain a little: the amendment was left vague people the author held a strong sense of equality and a strong sense of fair treatment. He wanted to preserve equality and fair treatment no matter the situation. It may very well be the case that he was hoping a situation like same-sex marriage would arise and that his amendment could be used to preserve equality. If the author had intended it to be specific, he would have made it specific. But he wanted to preserve equality for everyone, not just equality based on race.\n \n A strict constitutionalist might say, \"Okay, then we must apply this to marriage.\" An activist might say, \"Wait a minute, he could never have known that we'd be applying this to homosexual relationships. The states should decide this.\"\n \n \nWith all due respect, Jaxian, you have begun speaking out of both sides of your mouth on this. You keep trying to turn this issue back on us, but you've ended up contradicting yourself in the process. You've argued that it's the morally right thing to do to give gays marriage, and then here you seem to claim that the NON-altrusitic stance is to give gays marriage.\n\n \n Well, remember that both strict constitutionalists and activists can be non-altruistic. That is the primary misunderstanding about activists.\n \n Anyhow, I certainly agree that it is morally the right thing to allow same-sex marriage. I also agree that a non-altruistic decision by a strict constitutionalist will lead you to support same-sex marriage. The 14th Amendment, in this case, is protecting something that is moral, so you don't have to insert your own morality as a judge.\n \n \nJP's (and my) point here is that we don't like the idea of a judge bringing altruistic intentions into legal interpretation. A judge should never look at a case like gay marriage and judge it based on his idea that \"it's the right thing to do.\" Likewise, he shouldn't look at a case like prayer in schools or the 10 commandments in a courthouse and judge it based on his idea of \"it's the right thing to do.\" It goes both ways.

Again, it's not a matter of whether there's judicial activism, but rather it's an issue of degree.\n\n \n Remember that as I just wrote, judicial activism isn't the same thing as bringing altruistic intentions into legal interpretations. Though it can be. Regarding the 10 commandments case and the prayer in school case, the Constitution, I think, simply isn't specific enough to explain what it means. So the debate over which side is activist and which side is strict constitutionalist gets a bit tricky. It may be that both sides are activist.\n \n Overall, I think it's a bad idea to be too strict-constituationalist, and it's a bad idea to be too activist. Like you, I don't think people should interpret the 14th Amendment to mean that it protects everything. I think the fact that the author never could have predicted same-sex marriage should be factored in. Even though strict constitutionalists would use the amendment to approve of same-sex marriage, I'm not a strict constitutionalist. I believe that the author did intend his amendment to be used in a fashion very similar to the one we're seeing in the case of same-sex marriage. Two activists can come up with two different interpretations of the spirit of the Constitution.",

One can pretty much assume that most historical figures at that time (and really all the way up to the sexual revolution) would have viewed homosexual behavior as very immoral. There were limited exceptions here and there, but to assume just anyone would have viewed same-sex marriage as a mockery of the institution is to take history out of context and judge it through modern trends. There's no way they would have ever intended the 14th for something like same-sex marriage--you're a smart man, Jaxian, and I think you know that. It was not left vague to allow for any behavior that comes along; it was left vague because they didn't want to limit the benefits of citizenship to ONE ethnic group--freed black slaves.

   "You have to be kidding, here. One can pretty much assume that most historical figures at that time (and really all the way up to the sexual revolution) would have viewed homosexual behavior as very immoral. There were limited exceptions here and there, but to assume just anyone would have viewed same-sex marriage as a mockery of the institution is to take history out of context and judge it through modern trends. There's no way they would have ever intended the 14th for something like same-sex marriage--you're a smart man, Jaxian, and I think you know that. It was not left vague to allow for any behavior that comes along; it was left vague because they didn't want to limit the benefits of citizenship to ONE ethnic group--freed black slaves. But there is no doubt they never envisioned any group coming along and trying to claim the amendment over a behavioral issue.\n\n \n And so you claim to know the intentions of an individual you have never met and whose name you likely do not know without looking it up? As a matter of fact, I believe that their intentions were to prevent a legal institution like marriage from being created in the first place.\n \n I do not mean to claim that the author of the 14th Amendment nor any who voted to approve it would have stated their intentions to be to legalize same-sex marriage. But to believe that those men did not understand the limitations of their own cultural upbringing would be an ignorant one. Those who voted to approve it would have hoped that the amendment could superceed the limitations of their culture and their own understanding, that its words are true enough so that if their own culture disagrees with them, then it is more likely that their culture is wrong than those words. They may not have approved of homosexuality or thought of it when writing the amendment, but the amendment was likely written to protect people in the future that their society did not protect at the time, and it was certainly designed to protect people that they were not thinking of at the time. \n \n \nIs it? The 14th was written to give freed slaves the benefits of citizenship. That's historical fact.\n\n \n That is an irrational statement. It is not historical fact. Were it written for slaves alone it would have stated slaves specifically. By not making a specific statement, it is almost certain that this amendment was not intended to be applied only to freed slaves.\n \n \nI don't anyone ever said marriage had to be based on 'logic.' It's based on cultural and societal beliefs and standards. It just so happens you don't like the standard.\n\n \n I do not aree with this statement. Cultural and societal beliefs should not determine who is protected by the law, who gets benefits, or who gets rights. If this were true, then you should have no problem with a country like France stripping all legal rights from religious people. No, every person deserves freedom, equality and happiness under the law. When the law denies any of those without a good logical reason, then the law is morally evil, to some degree.\n \n If cultural and societal beliefs and standards should determine who gets benefits under the law, then I assure you that the majority will always get the most benefits, and the minority will always get the least. It will be mob rule. It is human nature to believe that you are doing what is right and others are doing what is wrong, and that sort of thinking will lead to unfair treatment for minorities every time.

Wealth is an inequality created by the government's enforcement of capitalism.

For it is not all of the people in France agreeing upon a government, it is the majority agreeing upon a government.

Morality should decide this. But since morality cannot be agreed upon, we must come up with a system of government that is most likely to create a moral government. The best way to do this is to make certain that every group has a say, because each group will look out for itself before it harms others.

Let me make it more clear: Morality, a government that protects freedom and happiness for everyone, should be the law, but that is impossible. So we must put in a system which is most likely to come close to and achieve that goal. Cultural and societal beliefs should not be the only thing that determines our law. But those beliefs, or the will of the majority as I call it, should play a part in determining our law, because that is the only real way to prevent individual rulers from acting outside the best interest of the people. Yet the rule of the majority can also act outside the best interest of the minority or even the people as a whole, so both must check each other.\n \n \nOne could argue that it would mob rule no matter what the majority felt. Again, the point is that we allow the majority to determine things all the time, and it works fine.\n\n \n But it is only mob rule if the majority is imposing upon the minority. In truth, the individuals who produce the goods simply produce the item that sells the best.\n \n We do allow the majority to determine things often, and it's often for the best. But it is not always for the best. That is why slavery and women's rights keep coming up. In those cases, the majority was wrong. The majority has been wrong many times, but in those specific cases, the majority was really, really wrong. The same could be true of witch-burners, nazis, etc.\n \n Our federal government is not designed so that the majority can do whatever it wants, and there is a very good reason for this. If the majority can do whatever it wants, we will end up in a society where some minority is oppressed and treated poorly, even if the majority does agree on some things. The majority in America is educated on the principles of the Constitution and past prejudices, and that makes them more often moral and just than many socities in the past.

What is evil in one country may in fact not be in another. Let me give you an example: in a 3rd world country I visited last year and the year before, it is common for Americans (always wealthier) who live there to have house servants. Sometimes, Americans new to the culture feel very bad about this out of a sense of desire for equality, feeling as though they shouldn't employ locals there to do their work for them. (Too much like slavery, or indentured servantude.) But in fact it looks very greedy for Americans to NOT have house servants there, because the local people there view it as helping people out by giving them employment. An American who comes in but doesn't offer his or her home as a chance to give a poor person an opportunity to make some money (and feel as though they've earned it rather than charity) is thought of as greedy.\n \n One could say that 'the whole system there is messed up though' if the people there are that poor. To some extent that's true, although my experience is that the people there are quite content. It's Americans who tend to never be satisfied with their sitauation and always tend to feel unfairly treated. It seems much of the rest of the world realizes that not having as much as someone else (whether it be wealth or even marriage benefits) doesn't mean it's reflection of one's value as a person. What you think is right for France (for instance) may not be what THEY feel is right for them.\n \n \nI think you are using the term \"people\" in the popular sense, when what you really should be using is the \"majority\". For it is not all of the people in France agreeing upon a government, it is the majority agreeing upon a government.\n\n \n I think you are mistaking 'majority rule' for popularity and voting. When a govt. is elected, someone has to lose the election. That's always going to be the minority voters. There's no way around that, unless you want to go back to monarchy.\n \n \nThey should not. Morality should decide this.\n\n \n I agree--that's why I don't think gay marriage should be put into law.

(Sorry, I didn't make myself clear on that one.)\n\n \n Oh, well you're right about that. But England was wrong. Although England was able to treat those people who came to America unfairly, it was morally wrong for England to do that.\n \n \nIt's interesting to me that you seem to refer to things in terms of evil and good--as if there were some universal definition. What is evil in one country may in fact not be in another. Let me give you an example: in a 3rd world country I visited last year and the year before, it is common for Americans (always wealthier) who live there to have house servants. Sometimes, Americans new to the culture feel very bad about this out of a sense of desire for equality, feeling as though they shouldn't employ locals there to do their work for them. (Too much like slavery, or indentured servantude.) But in fact it looks very greedy for Americans to NOT have house servants there, because the local people there view it as helping people out by giving them employment. An American who comes in but doesn't offer his or her home as a chance to give a poor person an opportunity to make some money (and feel as though they've earned it rather than charity) is thought of as greedy.\n\n \n Well, I like to think that a moral action is that which is in the best interest of the people and an immoral one is that which is harmful to the people. In the example provided above, both the American and the local people wanted to do the moral thing, but it is actually more moral for the American to hire servants, for that is actually in the best interest of everyone.\n \n \nOne could say that 'the whole system there is messed up though' if the people there are that poor. To some extent that's true, although my experience is that the people there are quite content. It's Americans who tend to never be satisfied with their sitauation and always tend to feel unfairly treated. It seems much of the rest of the world realizes that not having as much as someone else (whether it be wealth or even marriage benefits) doesn't mean it's reflection of one's value as a person. What you think is right for France (for instance) may not be what THEY feel is right for them.\n\n \n Well, I do not disapprove of people who are poor incomparison to us being content with their lives. But that is very different from the law of that nation treating one person better than it treats his neighbor. You seem to be comparing same-sex couples to the poor nation. You understand that they have less, but if the poor nation can be content with less, why can't same-sex couples?\n \n The difference is that same-sex couples are living under a government which treats them worse than it treats opposite-sex couples. Americans want more because their neighbor has more, but that third world country doesn't believe that America has more. And maybe it doesn't.\n \n But what is certainly true is that opposite-sex couples have more. And it is immoral to tell those who you are below you that they should be happy with what they've got, that they shouldn't ask for everything you have because they just don't qualify for the same special treatment you have.\n \n \nI think you are mistaking 'majority rule' for popularity and voting. When a govt. is elected, someone has to lose the election. That's always going to be the minority voters. There's no way around that, unless you want to go back to monarchy.\n\n \n Popularity and voting are majority rule. But in our nation, the majority doesn't usually get to make the law. The majority elect people to make the law for them. Since people will vote for the person who protects themselves before they vote for the person who harms others, elected officials tend to be people who help as many people as possible. But when we put a single issue, not an elected official, up to a majority vote, the minority will end up oppressed.\n \n \nI agree--that's why I don't think gay marriage should be put into law. Or do you just want YOUR vision or morality to be made law?\n\n \n I certainly do want my vision of morality put into law, and that is why I am trying to convince you that my vision of morality is correct, my vision should be your vision, and your old vision is actually immoral, you just didn't realize it.\n \n My point here is that the issue the majority believes to be moral is not necessarily the one that is actually moral. There is one decision that helps people, and there is one that harms them, and the majority sometimes supports the decision to harm people.\n \n \nUnless there is a monarchy or communist rule, majority rule cannot be avoided. It's the way voting works. You just need to convince more people of your views and move the majority in your direction rather than trying to change our system of government.\n\n \n You're mistaken. I am the one supporting our system of government. You are the one who complained about activist judges. Remember? I am explaining why judges exist and why we do not rely on nothing but the majority.\n \n People are treated unfairly every day that same-sex marriage is illegal and each day that passes without same-sex marriage, more people will die never having been equal. But I understand that our system of government is the best approach to preserve equality in the long run. I will just have to do all that I can to support same-sex marriage and hope that my actions will help.\n \n \nIt was for a time, but the reason it changed is that enough people changed their mind about it. It was no longer a majority-rule issue. By the time slavery was overturned, the majority was no longer in favor of it.\n\n \n The reasons these things change are sometimes due to majority opinion, sometimes due to legislative action, and sometimes due to judicial action. Each one is sometimes right, each one sometimes wrong. The point is not that the majority is never right or doesn't eventually change its mind to make it right, the point is that the majority is sometimes wrong, and they are sometimes so wrong that they hurt countless people in unimaginably horrible ways.\n \n \nSure it is. It's why we vote. You just need to convince enough of the public.\n\n \n No, our Federal government is designed so that the majority puts a check on the power of our leaders, the people who actually make the laws.",

   "They arne't the same issue. Taxes are forced on people; wealth is not.\n\n \n So because people willingly accept wealth but don't willingly accept taxes, they aren't both part of the same subject? No, I disagree; both capitalism and taxes are methods used by the government to control who gets wealth and how they get it.\n \n \nBut the point is, the citizens there who didn't like the policy had the good sense to leave. If the U.S. started up too much policy that I vehemently disagreed with I might leave here too. Many nations may not have your idea of a moral govt., but no one is making you live there.\n\n \n If you are not telling gay people to go somewhere else, then I don't see your point. Are you trying to say that the harm created by denying same-sex marriage is justifiable because people can avoid the harm by leaving? That will never be sufficient justification.\n \n What I can say is that I am not going to leave because I am trying to work within the nation's legal bounds to achieve equality for people other than myself; I'm not trying to benefit myself. Leaving won't help anyone. If you do not believe those are my reasons, that is okay, but I am going to continue to work for legal equality.\n \n \nAgain, that's all too subjective and open to opinion as to what constitutes harm and best interest. And it doesn't deal well with issues such as peoples' feelings. I'd hate to think my view of morality was merely rooted in the issue of what constitutes harm.\n\n \n People's feelings? I cannot accept that denying legal equality is acceptable if legal equality hurts the feelings of someone unrelated. If that were the case, we might as well elevate the majority in every aspect, for surely the majority will never have their feelings hurt if they are treated superior to the minority in every respect.\n \n Furthermore, if people's feelings really are important, then hurting those feelings does constitute a \"harm\". I do not understand what you mean when you say that your view of morality is rooted in more than harms and benefits. What else could it be rooted in?\n \n \nNot in a meaningful and significant enough way to change the law.\n\n \n Every way in which same-sex couples are treated worse is a significant enough way to change the law. Opposite-sex couples deserve nothing more than same-sex couples. They don't deserve special benefits, they don't deserve a title, they don't deserve children, they don't deserve property rights, and they don't even deserve chocolate chip cookies any more than same-sex couples. And our law should give them nothing more or nothing less than it gives same-sex couples.\n \n \nMY neighbor has a sports car--yet I don't demand I have one too. Even if he got it from govt. subsidy. We should give you the same benefits through a different means than marriage, as marriage is for opposite-sex couples.\n\n \n Well, I don't see how the analogy fits. If your neighbor has more than you, then he got it because we operate under capitalism, and although capitalism destroys equality, it creates more benefit for everyone than it does harm. If your neighbor got the sports car from a government subsidy, then presumably everyone is better off with the subsidy than without it, or the subsidy shouldn't have happened.\n \n But what does that have to do with giving everyone the same benefits through a different means? That sports car reference in no way justifies granting people the same benefits through different means. Both same-sex and opposite-sex couples deserve access to the same means; what is your justification for saying that they do not?\n \n \nSame thing, just not direct. People elect lawmakers who WILL make the laws they want. That's our system. So for all practical purposes, the majority DOES make the law. If you don't like that, then you are going against the American system. (which is your right, but you won't get very far.)\n\n \n People elect lawmakers who agree with them on the most important issues, and the most important issues tend to be those that benefit themselves, not those that harm others. Few people believe in everything a lawmaker believes in. The majority sometimes doesn't agree with a legislature's decision, and it sometimes doesn't agree with a judge's decision. The majority doesn't make the law, elected officials do that, but you can't become an elected official without appealing to the most important issues. The majority do not rule; the power of the majority is checked.\n \n Perhaps Madison explains it better than I do here:\n http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/federal/fed10.htm\n \n \nI already told you, I came to agree with you that some judicial activism takes place. I realize that judges exist as a check, but you seem to have the idea that judges cannot be wrong and that they are infallible. (especially when they rule the way you want them to) The judiciary has a lot more power in this country than it has in the past, and IMO it's too much like a monarchy when individual men are given so much power. At least with a majority, there has to be agreement in that majority. With individuals who overstep their boundaries as a check, they themselves should have a check placed on them. Judges should not be allowed to be dictators.\n\n \n Yet judges are not allowed to be dictators. Judges cannot create law, they can only render a law or restriction on a law void, until enough support can be built that it is written into the Constitution. I do not believe judges cannot be wrong, for they are often wrong, and it is as possible for them to rule against same-sex marriage as for them to rule in favor of it. But that doesn't mean that a decision against the will of the majority is wrong, either. Either the majority or the judge may be wrong.\n \n \nBut this isn't an issue of checking the majority, it's an issue of you needing to convince the majority to add some things. Remember, it's you are seeking to get something others, by law don't have (the ability to legally marry outside of society's definition of marriage)\n\n \n I am not seeking to get something others don't have. The ability to legally marry outside of society's definition of marriage is not a tangible legal benefit, it merely describes that the majority currently does not approve of same-sex marriage. While this is true, the majority's disapproval of same-sex marriage does not indicate that additional legal benefits should be granted in any way to same-sex couples. I ask only for equal treatment.\n \n It is true that the majority will probably need to be convinced for this equal treatment to actually happen, but I don't see your point. I already know that, and certainly haven't been arguing against it. Though I do say that the majority today is wrong, and they are harming people without just cause.",

Communism has nothing to do with the rights of the people or the rule of the majority, and isn't that what we're talking about? It sounds to me that you do not understand how the American government works and why it is set up as it is.

The problem is, it's not just legal equality we're talking about, and THAT's the reason you don't have it.\n\n \n Then this is the spot where we disagree. I state that creating a right or benefit with a special restriction on it that denies it to a certain group of people is the very definition of equality in every way. Tell me, why do you disagree? I do not understand how you can disagree.\n \n \nIn an immeasurable way.\n\n \n What do you mean here? That feelings are more important than other harms?\n \n \nGoing over and above 'not harming' others. And doing what I can to keep immorality from becoming a normal-as-apple-pie thing. Personally, I WANT my children growing up in a more moral society, not one where violence, pornography, homosexual living, drugs, promiscuity and hate has too big a hold on society.\n\n \n Well with the exception of homosexuality, I want the same thing, and I think you've unfairly thrown it in with a bunch of harmful things. And I can understand not wanting your child to grow up in a society where homosexuality has a larger acceptance in society, but if you can't really list any harm from that, do you really have any justification for telling me or Joe or anyone else here that we can't have the same legal recognition of the commitment of the person we love?\n \n \nThe majority DOES make law, by electing officials (by vote) that will make and/or enforce the law it wants.

Did you read that Federalist Papers article I linked to? I apologize if it was confusing, but it is one of the most important articles in the Federalist Papers.\n \n \nYou're right! they aren't allowed to do that, which is why I oppose it when judges do this. That issue is what started this whole discussion. If judges indeed did what you say they should (and are right in saying), then we wouldn't be having this discussion.\n \n I also think you terribly underestimate the power judges have, or rather have come to have.\n\n \n I do not underestimate the powers of a the judges; they effectively have the power to do anything they want.

   "This is one thing I can assure you that I will never, ever agree with. You suggest that I should see people being treated unfairly then do nothing about it? You suggest that if I don't want to see people treated unfairly, I should go somewhere where they aren't? You suggest that I should not make it my life's goal to help people but to make my own self comfortable? I can't even fathom why you would suggest such a thing to me, but there is not a word of it I will ever agree with.\n\n \n Well, you claim that it's all about fairness to you, but I really think that it's really only about same-sex marriage. There are many unfair things in society and I honestly think that if fairness in general in society was your driving motivation, then you'd be on a lot of different forums than this one, on many different topics. Don't get me wrong, I'm not criticizing you here, I just find it hard to believe the gay rights movement is being honest when they use 'fairness' and 'equality' as mantras, given the far broader implications of those terms.\n \n Again, no one is going to make you stop taking up your political cause. But I wonder why the early colonials who left England didn't simply 'stick it out' and try to reform their govt. into the image they thought was the right one? I think they had the good sense to know that people can't always have the govt. the way they want and so they did the logical thing and moved on. To me, that's a more noble thing to do that to to have tried to change the govt into their own image when in fact their image may not have been the best one after all. I think that applies here. What you claim to be fair treatment (or lack thereof) is your opinion, but that doesn't mean it's right.\n \n \nWhy is that? Communism has nothing to do with the rights of the people or the rule of the majority, and isn't that what we're talking about? It sounds to me that you do not understand how the American government works and why it is set up as it is. I have been explaining why I support the American government above all other governments currently existing. How does that lead you to draw the conclusion that I would prefer a different government?\n\n \n Because you seem to be against ANY form of inequality. That's basically the way communism works. A society completely free from any form of inequality whatsoever is a communistic one.\n \n \nThen this is the spot where we disagree. I state that creating a right or benefit with a special restriction on it that denies it to a certain group of people is the very definition of equality in every way. Tell me, why do you disagree? I do not understand how you can disagree.\n\n \n When I said 'it's not just legal equality we're talking about' (which is what you were answering here), I simply meant that for this particular issue there is also a cultural/societal/moral factor involved. Look, you know as well as I do that homosexual living is to a large extent taboo in this country, and always has been. Whether you aprove or disapprove of that reality, that's the way it is. Many people see your movement as trying to ligitimize that taboo behavior into law by giving it marriage status. There are many issues out there that are equality issues, but this particular one is also a big moral issue. I realize that you don't believe homosexual living is immoral, and that's your right to believe that. But most people, I dare say, do believe it. And so they aren't going to view this as really a rights issue, but an attempt-to-gain-legitimacy-for-a-behavior issue.\n \n \nWhat do you mean here? That feelings are more important than other harms?\n\n \n No, that feelings can't really be measured and quantified and therefore can't really be a deterimining factor for what constitutes harm.\n \n \nWell with the exception of homosexuality, I want the same thing, and I think you've unfairly thrown it in with a bunch of harmful things.\n\n \n Perhaps. I see it differently, and I believe many people in society do as well.\n \n \nAnd I can understand not wanting your child to grow up in a society where homosexuality has a larger acceptance in society, but if you can't really list any harm from that, do you really have any justification for telling me or Joe or anyone else here that we can't have the same legal recognition of the commitment of the person we love?\n\n \n Let me ask you something. If I or anyone responded by saying \"I believe you should have the benefits you want just like opposite sex couples, but I still believe your actions as a person living a homosexual life is immoral\", would you accept that? Can you truly separate the moral question from the legal one?",

Don't get me wrong, I'm not criticizing you here, I just find it hard to believe the gay rights movement is being honest when they use 'fairness' and 'equality' as mantras, given the far broader implications of those terms.\n\n \n There are a lot of issues in politics. There is a lot of controversy. I am very interested in politics, and I like to think that I know a lot about a lot of issues.\n \n But I do focus on gay rights, and there are reasons for that.\n \n First, gay rights are the only controversial issue in politics today that I can find where I believe there is not a single logical reason that my opponents could present which actually makes any sense at all. In every single other political issue, there is at least some reason to do things my opponent's way, some logical argument. Because I don't believe there are any logical arguments against gay rights, the following things are true: I enjoy debating it more (I feel good when I believe I've posted a strong, logical argument). I feel it is more necessary to debate it (If there are no negative aspects of gay rights, then we should get this issue off the table and show the government that it needs a real reason to deny rights). \n \n On a similar note, I am deeply into political theory, and this issue rests on the foundation of my political beliefs. By explaining this issue, I can also explain what I believe to be the foundations of American government, I can explain the reasons that no argument against same-sex marriage makes sense. This issue is what I believe to be the perfect example of an issue where we can choose good government or bad government. Understanding this issue will hopefully help my opponents understand the reasons we have government in the first place.\n \n Also, because I have seen excessive hatred of homosexuals, while I have seen less hatred of virtually every other group, I feel that they need more help than anyone else in getting their rights legalized.\n \n These things combine to make me a very strong supporter of gay rights.\n \n \nAgain, no one is going to make you stop taking up your political cause. But I wonder why the early colonials who left England didn't simply 'stick it out' and try to reform their govt. into the image they thought was the right one? I think they had the good sense to know that people can't always have the govt. the way they want and so they did the logical thing and moved on. To me, that's a more noble thing to do that to to have tried to change the govt into their own image when in fact their image may not have been the best one after all. I think that applies here. What you claim to be fair treatment (or lack thereof) is your opinion, but that doesn't mean it's right.\n\n \n But because there is no doubt in my mind that my opinion is the only fair method, I consider it noble to work for that fair treatment. It sounds to me that if you lived back in the times of slavery, you would suggest that an opponent of slavery simply stop fighting to help the slaves and move to a country where slavery is illegal. It is not noble to leave people in injustice, not in a nation where injustice can be rooted out.\n \n Those Colonials may have given up on England, and realistically, England did not have a government system where change was likely to happen. Perhaps they did not wish to fight for others, and I would not force them to. Or perhaps they saw in America the potential for a stronger nation, where they could enforce religious freedom and set an example for the world. As was stated by the founders, they had the opportunity to remake the world, to found it on democracy instead of monarchy. And they did that. If I saw an opportunity to help people in a greater fashion than I am doing now, I would take that opportunity.\n \n \nBecause you seem to be against ANY form of inequality. That's basically the way communism works. A society completely free from any form of inequality whatsoever is a communistic one.\n\n \n I support the happiness of the people, and generally that means preserving equality and freedom, but not always. Communism may be free from inequality, at least on the economic side of things, but it does not provide incentive for people to be productive, and it therefore does not produce much, and therefore the citizens do not have much. Such a nation is not only unable to provide its citizens with a high standard of living, but it is also unable to protect itself.\n \n Capitalism destroys equality, and that isn't a good thing. But it makes life better for everyone; it's worth losing equality. It would be better to have Communism if a Communistic government that produces as much as Capitalism could be created. But I haven't seen any successes at that yet. As is a popular phrase, Communism works in theory. But in practice, that is another story.\n \n \nWhen I said 'it's not just legal equality we're talking about' (which is what you were answering here), I simply meant that for this particular issue there is also a cultural/societal/moral factor involved. Look, you know as well as I do that homosexual living is to a large extent taboo in this country, and always has been. Whether you aprove or disapprove of that reality, that's the way it is. Many people see your movement as trying to ligitimize that taboo behavior into law by giving it marriage status. There are many issues out there that are equality issues, but this particular one is also a big moral issue.

And so they aren't going to view this as really a rights issue, but an attempt-to-gain-legitimacy-for-a-behavior issue.\n\n \n Well, I won't argue with you that most in the gay rights movement believe same-sex marriage shouldn't be taboo at all. I won't deny that I believe that. And I won't deny that I'd love for everyone to believe that. However, we are not working to make that happen, we are working for equal rights under the law. It may be true that if same-sex marriage is legalized, less people will see it as taboo. But we will not force that upon them; all we will do is make the laws equal and let people decide for themselves.\n \n You see this as an attempt to legitimize same-sex marriage, but it is more important to me that we have equal legal rights for homosexuals. I do understand your concern for legitimizing same-sex marriage, and I believe that as much as our goal is to legitimize same-sex marriage, yours is to keep it illegitimate. But all we are doing is trying to put everyone on an equal level. Your side is trying to keep homosexuality illegitimate by denying people rights, but making homosexuals legally less than heterosexuals. That isn't fair; don't do that. Let's make everyone legally equal, then we can each preach our own religious viewpoints. That's fair, and that's the right thing to do.\n \n \nNo, that feelings can't really be measured and quantified and therefore can't really be a deterimining factor for what constitutes harm.\n\n \n Well, I don't think that matters, though I do think that an individual's feelings are not worth causing more physical harm to someone else. In the case where failing to harm someone hurts another's feelings, the cause of those hurt feelings is usually intolerance of the individuals being harmed or the desire to be elevated above others, not the fact that the individual wasn't harmed.\n \n \nPerhaps. I see it differently, and I believe many people in society do as well.\n\n \n Yet until you can explain the how there is even one harm in homosexuality, let alone a harm as large as those you would associate it with, I have no reason to think that your beliefs are anything but wrong. I will continue to do what I can to explain why mine are right.\n \n \nLet me ask you something. If I or anyone responded by saying \"I believe you should have the benefits you want just like opposite sex couples, but I still believe your actions as a person living a homosexual life is immoral\", would you accept that? Can you truly separate the moral question from the legal one?\n\n \n I believe that you should have the same benefits and rights as a gay rights supporter, even though I believe your actions as a person opposing gay rights are extremely immoral. I believe that KKK members should have the same benefits and rights as I do, even though I believe their actions, as a person who speaks out against minority races, are extremely immoral.\n \n Although our law does punish immorality, it should not choose one man's morality over another's. Our law should punish people only when they violate someone else's rights, only when they make life more difficult for someone else.\n \n If you said, \"I believe same-sex couples should have access to the exact same legal rights and benefits as opposite-sex couples, but I still believe their actions as a people living a homosexual life are immoral\", I would accept every word of that, and I would hold you in high esteem as someone who truly understands what it means to live in a free and equal nation, someone who understands that freedom and equality mean more than just freedom and equality for popular groups, that even annoying people have rights.",

To some extent I agree. But the reason that doesn't matter so much is that this issue is about homosexuality, which involves more than just arguments based on logic.

I think one of the biggest problems here is that gay marriage opponents often ONLY want to talk about it in terms of morality, and gay rights proponents often ONLY want to talk about it in logical argumentative ways. Perhaps both sides should give a bit.\n \n \nAlso, because I have seen excessive hatred of homosexuals, while I have seen less hatred of virtually every other group, I feel that they need more help than anyone else in getting their rights legalized.\n\n \n Hmm . . . well, I don't find it hard to see groups that have suffered a lot more than gay people in this country, so to me that reason is tenuous.\n \n \nIt sounds to me that if you lived back in the times of slavery, you would suggest that an opponent of slavery simply stop fighting to help the slaves and move to a country where slavery is illegal.\n\n \n To me, I feel I would be more likely to oppose slavery or support opponents of slavery because of my opposition to gay marriage, which seeks to impose an outside way of thinking on our govt and society.

If all thing were the same between homosexual people and heterosexual people, I might agree, but they're not.

Perhaps both sides should give a bit.\n\n \n Well, I do want to talk about morality, but I don't want to see one individual's idea of morality put into law above another's. I believe that your version of morality is actually evil. And I will go on and on about why your version of morality is evil, if you desire. But my solution isn't to give you less and me more, it isn't to give me marriage and you civil unions. It is to give everyone the same thing.\n \n \nHmm . . . well, I don't find it hard to see groups that have suffered a lot more than gay people in this country, so to me that reason is tenuous.\n\n \n It isn't about suffering; people are generally kind-hearted, and they appeal to prevent suffering where they can. It's about being genuinely disliked, for when that happens, people don't care about your suffering. It isn't about suffering the most, it's about people who aren't willing to stop your suffering because they don't think you deserve it.\n \n \nTo me, I feel I would be more likely to oppose slavery or support opponents of slavery because of my opposition to gay marriage, which seeks to impose an outside way of thinking on our govt and society. As far as I'm concerned, opposition to slavery and opposition to gay marriage is part of the same ideological continuum.\n\n \n I'm not certain what you mean. Opposition to slavery was based on the idea that the government should impose itself upon a society which accepted slavery because the slaves did not deserve to be treated unfairly. If you are against imposing an outside way of thinking on our government and society, then I would expect you to have supported slavery. Or you would have supported it until enough people spoke out against it, at least. And the whole time, you'd be telling those people who spoke out against it that they'd be happier living somewhere else.\n \n \nWell I believe homosexual living DOES have too much capacity for harm, as borne out by CDC stats.

(yes, sterile straight couples have the same problem, but theirs is the result of a physical limitation or handicap: sterility.) It's just way too far out in left field and has too much a capacity for harm.\n\n \n The harms you listed were an increased risk of STD's and an increased chance of suicide. Yet I would argue that both of those are caused by a lack of society's acceptance of homosexuality and a lack of equal rights. Same-sex marriage supports a form of homosexuality that superceeds those harms. Increased suicide is caused by a lack of acceptance for homosexuals. Legalizing same-sex marriage would first drop the current suicide rates in homosexuals because those homosexuals would not see society as quite as hateful of them. If any person not acting on his or her homosexual desires chose to do so because of same-sex marriage, that person would not be doing so under the understanding that they will be treated equally by our laws, and they would not be any more likely to commit suicide than they once were. We see a seemingly larger subculture of homosexuals who engage in unsafe sex only because with our societal disapproval of homosexuality, only those willing to be the most sexually deviant are the ones who engage in homosexuality, and those who do tend to view the standards of society as unreasonable.\n \n My point is that homosexuality is not dangerous; it is a disapproval of homosexuality that is dangerous. I'm not blaming those who created this aura of disapproval for the individual actions of those who commit suicide or engage in irresponsible sex. But it is irrational to look at the problems of a disapproval of homosexuality and to use that as justification for denying rights to homosexuals. If anything, the irresponsible subculture of homosexuals and higher suicide rates are reasons to get rid of this societal disapproval of homosexuality. I'm not going to force that upon anyone, but you need to understand that homosexuality is not harmful.\n \n I can tell you beyond a doubt that my sex is no more likely to give me an STD than yours. I can tell you beyond a doubt that I will not commit suicide. So tell me why me getting married to another man is harmful to anyone.\n \n \nSorry, but I'll never consider it immoral to oppose what's already immoral.\n\n \n Huh? Mmm, I think I see what you're saying. It isn't immoral to oppose an immoral act. I have no problem with that reasoning. Go ahead and oppose homosexuality all you want. But because homosexuality is immoral based on your opinion, and because me getting married to another man isn't harming anyone, don't oppose homosexuality by using the law to harm homosexuals. That's opposition by punishment, not opposition by teaching or leading by example.\n \n \nBut I understand your point. In many ways I believe I already hold to this idea that you should have the rights you need, regardless of my moral beliefs. That's why I support it. I just don't support you using marriage as the means to that end.\n\n \n Then let it be something else, just let it be the same for everyone. Or just understand that the legal institution of \"marriage\" doesn't have anything to do with religious \"marriage\". The legal institution that we currently call \"marriage\" is just a set of legal rights and benefits granted to some people. Call my marriage whatever you want, just let me use the same legal institution you use. Let all same-sex couples use the same legal institution you use.",

The South didn't appreciate the government interference of the north, tellling the South it needed to end slavery.\n \n \nWell I believe homosexual living DOES have too much capacity for harm, as borne out by CDC stats.\n\n \n That is because you are ignorant. The CDC stats don't say being gay is harmful.\n \n \nAnd it's my understanding that suicide rates are higher among those who are homosexual.\n\n \n It's also decreased in recent years, as social acceptance has increased. The lack of social acceptance is a factor in suicide. Homosexuality itself is not a factor...\n \n Of the 10 studies, 6 explored risks for suicide by comparing attemptors and nonattemptors. They found that suicide attempts were neither universal nor attributable to homosexuality per se, but they were significantly associated with gender nonconformity,3 early awareness of homosexuality,3, 8, 11, 14 stress,12 violence,14 lack of support,8, 11, 14 school drop-out,12 family problems,8 acquaintances' suicide attempts,12 homelessness,12 and substance abuse3 or other psychiatric symptoms.6, 11, 14 \n \n http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/282/13/1291\n \n \nSo harm is indeed one reason I believe homosexual living is immoral. I realize you only view the problem as a subset of homosexuality (or \"subculture\" as you've called it), but I don't see it that way.\n\n \n That's because you are making ridiculous generalizations.\n \n \nIf all thing were the same between homosexual people and heterosexual people, I might agree, but they're not. The means of intercourse is different in that gay people CAN'T have real intercourse (only other things that some straight people might do along WITH sex), and the ONLY sexual acts they can engage in are ones that are more open to STD infection.\n\n \n Your knowledge of sexuality can fit into a thimble. Gay people have a wide variety of sex acts to engage in. Some are considered low risk, others high risk, just like with heterosexuals. Vaginal or anal intercourse without a condom is high risk. Oral sex is considered low risk, even lower with a condom or dental dam. Mutual masturbation is low risk. What in the world are \"other things that go along with sex\"?\n \n \nAlso, their very coupling arrangement (same-sex) makes procreation impossible without 3rd party intervention. (yes, sterile straight couples have the same problem, but theirs is the result of a physical limitation or handicap: sterility.)\n\n \n It's also impossible if you've had your tubes tied a vacetomy, are taking the pill or using a condom, or are having one of the many types of sex which don't involve vaginal penetration with a penis. The fact that it doesn't lead to reproduction doesn't make it harmful. In fact, creating another mouth to feed, or an \"accident\", just because, would be harmful. \n \n \nIt's just way too far out in left field\n\n \n You are far out in left field, homosexuality is not. If being gay is so far out in left field, you have nothing to worry about. Society would never move towards accepting it. Gay rights and acceptance would not have advanced as far as it has, if it were way out in the left field of society.\n \n \nand has too much a capacity for harm.\n\n \n There is no harm.\n \n \nBut I understand your point. In many ways I believe I already hold to this idea that you should have the rights you need, regardless of my moral beliefs. That's why I support it. I just don't support you using marriage as the means to that end.\n\n \n However, you will let your personal moral beliefs prohibit marriage.

It is to give everyone the same thing.\n\n \n If you were truly arguing that we all should have the 'same thing', you'd be arguing for the right to marry opposite sex people, as that would be the same right I have. But you're not--you're arguing for a whole new way of doing marriage.\n \n \nIt isn't about suffering . . . . it's about people who aren't willing to stop your suffering because they don't think you deserve it.\n\n \n I should have phrased it 'it's not hard to see groups that have had to deal with worse hate than you.' It's hard for society to stop something that's not systematic. I assure you that if you were being systematically beaten and killed or enslaved and made to suffer, many of us, myself included, would not hesitate to step up and fight to make sure that ended. But if by suffering you mean occassional funny looks, a name called, or whispering about you, then no--that's not quantifiable suffering. \n \n \nI'm not certain what you mean. Opposition to slavery was based on the idea that the government should impose itself upon a society which accepted slavery because the slaves did not deserve to be treated unfairly.\n\n \n But the issue of homosexual marriage is one of a group imposing on an institution by trying to change that institution and making it include a whole different way to marry. And since marriage is unique in that it is defined by society's cultural norms and values, you ad your movement are indeed in a sense imposing on the values and morals of many people.\n \n \nThe harms you listed were an increased risk of STD's and an increased chance of suicide. Yet I would argue that both of those are caused by a lack of society's acceptance of homosexuality and a lack of equal rights. \n\n \n IMO, this is a cop out. It's like as if a kid getting a poison ivy rash blamed his parents for the rash just because they said he shouldn't play in the middle of poison ivy.\n \n \nMy point is that homosexuality is not dangerous; it is a disapproval of homosexuality that is dangerous.\n\n \n Yes, I know that you believe this. \n \n \nI can tell you beyond a doubt that my sex is no more likely to give me an STD than yours. I can tell you beyond a doubt that I will not commit suicide.\n\n \n One could say that they will never have a catastrophe storing explosives if they do it safely. That still doesn't make it a good idea.\n \n \nand because me getting married to another man isn't harming anyone, don't oppose homosexuality by using the law to harm homosexuals.\n\n \n But we're not the ones trying to use the law.

   "Another point on this \"judges-don't-create-law\" misconception . . . \n \n We also need to remember that the SCOTUS often doesn't just rule on laws as they are, but on the actions of the state, institutions, and people as they affect others. For instance, if the court rules that prayer in school is illegal, they aren't judging a law at all but rather the actions of a school. By interpreting those actions as wrong based on the constitution, they are in effect creating law that says one can't pray in school. The constitution, after all, doesn't specify that prayer in schools is illegal. It never addresses prayer in school, specifically. The court therefore is adding restrictions that previously had not been there and were not specifically stated in the constitution. It's true they base that decision on constitutional reading of seperation of church and state, but there's no way to get around the fact that a legal restriction is now there that was not there before, once the ruling is made. They are therefore, creating law.",

I'm not doing that.\n \n \nIf you were truly arguing that we all should have the 'same thing', you'd be arguing for the right to marry opposite sex people, as that would be the same right I have. But you're not--you're arguing for a whole new way of doing marriage.\n\n \n I am truly arguing for everyone to have the same thing, and that includes the same right to marriage. It is nothing less than an intentional deception to say that gay people have the same right to marry as straight people. Marriage has a restriction which exists for no other purpose than to prevent gay people from marrying unless they become straight. I'm arguing for that restriction to be removed, and for all intents and purposes, straight people have more rights than gay people until that happens. Let us not ignore that truth by repeating technicalities, by saying what amounts to \"everyone has the right, but not everyone can use it.\"\n \n \nI should have phrased it 'it's not hard to see groups that have had to deal with worse hate than you.' It's hard for society to stop something that's not systematic.

But if by suffering you mean occassional funny looks, a name called, or whispering about you, then no--that's not quantifiable suffering.\n\n \n Of course it is not hard to see groups that have had to deal with worse hate than homosexuals. However, it is very hard to see any groups in America today who have to deal with worse hate than homosexuals. Do you want me to go back in time using my time machine to a time when people in America were being systematically beaten, killed, or enslaved? I assure you that I have no way of doing that.\n \n \nBut the issue of homosexual marriage is one of a group imposing on an institution by trying to change that institution and making it include a whole different way to marry. And since marriage is unique in that it is defined by society's cultural norms and values, you ad your movement are indeed in a sense imposing on the values and morals of many people.\n\n \n A group imposing on an institution? Good! The people should impose on an institution. The purpose of a legal institution is to serve the people, not the other way around. I will glady change marriage to make it bow to the needs of the people.\n \n And since slavery is unique in that it is defined by society's cultural norms and values, you and your movement are indeed in a sense imposing on the values and morals of many people.\n \n I may be assuring that the values and morals of many people do not remain in our law, but I am not actually taking away any of their rights or benefits for holding those values and morals. I'm not imposing on them, I'm just changing our laws so that our laws treat everyone equally.\n \n \nIMO, this is a cop out. It's like as if a kid getting a poison ivy rash blamed his parents for the rash just because they said he shouldn't play in the middle of poison ivy.\n\n \n Of course it is. The blame for those STD's and suicides rest solely on the individuals who engaged in the irresponsible sex and who committed suicide. But if the parents stopped their child from playing in the poison ivy, he still wouldn't have done it.\n \n I'm not blaming society for those things, but the fact is that those numbers would not be different from heterosexuals if society approved of homosexuality. It is neither homosexuality nor the nature of homosexuality which results in more homosexual individuals getting STD's or commiting suicide, and that means that your fears of promoting homosexuality are unfounded. Promoting homosexuality will in no way increase those numbers at all, and that is my point.\n \n \nOne could say that they will never have a catastrophe storing explosives if they do it safely. That still doesn't make it a good idea.\n\n \n It wouldn't be a good idea because it would still be possible for the explosives to blow up, no matter how safe you are. But if I have monogamous sex with another man who does not have any STD's, there is no chance of me getting an STD. If I do not kill myself, I will not have committed suicide. I can assure you that I will neither have unsafe sex nor kill myself, and being bisexual has nothing to do with that.\n \n I'm not storing explosives, I'm storing plastic, toy, pretend explosives that don't really blow up. They may look like explosives to you, but they cannot actually explode.\n \n \nBut we're not the ones trying to use the law. It's you all who are trying to use the law to change things by broadening marriage to include a new way to marry.\n\n \n Even though you want to keep our laws the same, we're both using the law. We both want the law to be one thing and not the other; whether we're changing it or not is irrelevant. And there is nothing wrong with using the law, if you're using it in the right way. But you are not using it the right way. You're using the law to force your ideals upon others, to punish them for living in a fashion that you don't approve of, to elevate your preferred lifestyle over someone else's. By denying homosexuals the same rights you have, you are harming them. You are using the law to the detriment of a minority group, with no benefit to anyone else, and that is why you are wrong.",

That is something I could never agree with, because marriage is an opposite-sex institution.\n \n \nI may be assuring that the values and morals of many people do not remain in our law, but I am not actually taking away any of their rights or benefits for holding those values and morals.\n\n \n That is beside the point. You may have your rights and benefits to gay marriage as far as I'm concerned. But not to marriage itself, which is a straight institution. Society at large has to be free to define it's own institutions and you seem to be trying to go agaist that freedom of society to do that by imposing your redefinition of marriage.\n \n \nI'm not blaming society for those things, but the fact is that those numbers would not be different from heterosexuals if society approved of homosexuality. \n\n \n I'm not sure what you mean here.

   "This is not an issue of who has more or less. It is an issue of an institution and morality.\n\n \n It is not an issue of an institution, the fact that this is an institution has nothing to do with this. You're right that it is an issue of morality, and that is precisely why who has more or less matters. It is immoral for the majority to give themselves more without just cause.\n \n \nBut you DO have that right! There's nothing deceptive about the truth--you really can legally go marry an opposite-sex partner anytime you want, so I'm not being deceptive at all in saying that. Now that tells us that what you are really seeking is not equality, but a changing of the definition of the institution of marriage to include a whle different sort of relationship. And that goes against society's moral beliefs. Again, if you were ONLY arguing for couples' benefits, I would agree 100% that you should have that. But you are going a step farther and trying to make what is an opposite-sex institution into something it is not.\n\n \n I really can go marry an opposite-sex partner, just like I really could go change my religion or my skin color or my hair color. But the mere fact that I must change in order to get a right is precisely what makes this right unfair and unequal. I should not have to change to get a right, I should not have to stop being homosexual to get the same rights that you have, and that is precisely what you are suggesting. You are stating, \"Homosexuals have the same rights as me, they just have to stop being homosexual.\" What if you were stating, \"Buddhists have the same rights as me, they just have to stop being Buddhist.\" Or maybe it's \"Blondes have the same rights as me, they just have to stop being blonde.\" Any right with that sort of provision is by its nature unfair and unequal. Forcing someone to change his body, his life, his beliefs, or his love in order to get the same rights as you is exactly what constitutes unfair treatment. It is prefferential treatment for people like you, and in this case, you do not deserve it.\n \n As you said, marriage is an opposite-sex institution according to our laws. It is not for everyone. I am trying to change a legal institution into something different than it is today, and in doing so, I am completely correct. There is no acceptable reason to preserve any institution if that institution is treating some people unfairly for no reason.\n \n \nIt's not a restriction per se, although it may seem like it to you; it's just the way marriage is by being uniquely heterosexual (by society's definition of marriage). You might as well be saying that it's a 'restriction' that you can't grow palm trees in Alaska. Yeah, it's a 'restriction' in a sense, but that's because of the nature of the climate. Just like marriage has that \"restriction\" because it's an opposite-sex institution. Society SHOULD define marriage, not a minority in that society. If we start letting small groups or individuals define the institutions that society at large agrees upon, then that's a receipe for oligarchy.\n\n \n My inability to grow palm trees in Alaska isn't really a restriction, since I am not disallowed from growing palm trees in Alaska, they just won't grow if I try it. If you consider that a restriction, it is a restriction which cannot be changed, and as such, it is not important to discuss whether or not we should change it. However, it is very possible to change a legal institution; that institution is made by the men who make the law, and it can be changed by those men.\n \n Defining marriage as an opposite-sex institution makes it exclusive, and whether you want to call that a restriction or not, people are prevented from using marriage, and that is all we need to know for this discussion.\n \n I'm not necessarily saying that we should let small groups or individuals decide our institutions, I'm saying that we should have a balanced legal system just like we have now. I'm saying that the people should elect officials to make these decisions, just as we do now. We should do that because we're most likely to get the most moral decisions that way.\n \n But we won't always get moral decisions, and we'll get more moral decisions if the people evaluate the issues and understand which choice is moral. I'm saying that in this case, legalizing same-sex marriage is moral, and you should agree with it.\n \n \nOk, fair enough. I'm not interested in a \"who-has-suffered-more\" sort of debate and I'm sure you aren't either. I realize gay people have needlessly suffered hate over time and in the present.\n\n \n All righty.\n \n \nBut yours is a case where a small minority is trying to redefine an institution for the majority. I agree institutions are to serve the people, and I would have no problem with you having an institution of gay marriage. But you aren't arguing for an institution of gay marriage, but rather for marriage itself to include gay relationships. That is something I could never agree with, because marriage is an opposite-sex institution.\n\n \n It started as a small minority, but it is no longer a small minority, it is a slight minority. We are trying to redefine an institution for the majority, though hopefully we will soon be the majority. We are doing this because doing so is a moral action, and not doing so is immoral.\n \n Marriage is an institution created by the majority to serve the majority. If you will not change it to serve everyone, then you must remove it from our laws or you are immoral. Opposite-sex couples do not deserve any special law or any special legal institution denied to same-sex couples. Tell me why you deserve more, why you deserve a special legal institution, and tell me why every benefit exclusive to opposite-sex couples should not be either removed or expanded to include same-sex couples.\n \n Why do you deserve a special legal institution that I do not? Why do you deserve a special legal institution that I do not? Why do you deserve a special legal institution that I do not? I ask three times for emphasis. I frankly do not care whether marriage is between men and women or dogs and logs, it is evil to give opposite-sex couples their own special legal institution by any name. If marriage is between a man and a woman, how can you possibly believe that it has any place in our laws besides under a category titled \"No law can be made acknowledging this:\"?\n \n \nThat is beside the point. You may have your rights and benefits to gay marriage as far as I'm concerned. But not to marriage itself, which is a straight institution. Society at large has to be free to define it's own institutions and you seem to be trying to go agaist that freedom of society to do that by imposing your redefinition of marriage.\n\n \n The only reason society deserves the right to define its own institutions is because society is more likely to make a moral choice than someone outside of society. It is not because society is always right. When society is wrong, it should ideally be denied the power to make that wrong decision.\n \n And you really need to understand the following point before you make any more claims that I'm trying to force something on society: My argument is that society should legalize same-sex marriage. My argument is that society is currently wrong, and I am trying to reveal that to as many people as possible so that society will change to be more fair. And judging by poll numbers, I am succeeding. Every time you suggest that I'm forcing something on society, you ignore the fact that the only thing I am doing is trying to convince society that it is wrong.\n \n \nI'm not sure what you mean here. Regardless, I think of homosexual practice as a way of living--a dangerous one. You can point to studies that indicate homosexuality is genetic or a matter of nature, but that still doesn't change the fact that people ultimately choose to live that way. We aren't robots or strangers to free will. Regarding your arguement that it's only a 'subset' that lives a dangerous life, I think anyone engaging in a potentially dangerous behavior could sort of make the argument \"but it's ok because I'm engaging in this potentially dangerous behavior in a safe way. That's pretty hollow reasoning if you ask me. You could take anyone engaging in any unsafe behavior out there and they could make that arguement.\n\n \n I was saying that without society's disapproval of homosexuality, the suicide rates between homosexuals and heterosexuals would be exactly the same, and the STD rates would be as well. A hiker might not tell a group of people he doesn't like to watch out for the poison ivy, and one of them might step in it for that reason. I don't blame the hiker, it is the fault of the guy who stepped in it, but the hiker could have prevented it.\n \n But I am not engaging in an unsafe behavior. There is zero chance of getting an STD if I do not have sex with someone that has an STD. There is zero chance of me committing suicide if I don't kill myself. Being bisexual or homosexual has nothing to do with whether or not I do those things. Even though homosexuals are more often doing those things, being homosexual isn't the problem, and it isn't any less safe than being heterosexual.\n \n I'll tell you what, if think homosexuality puts people at risk of STD's or suicide, then I think opposing homosexuality puts people at risk of murdering homosexuals. You engaging in this unsafe behavior in a safe way is pretty hollow reasoning if you ask me. So you say it's just a small subset or subculture of people who disapprove of homosexuality that are murdering homosexuals? Sorry, I still think your actions are dangerous. This is the same reasoning you're throwing at me, and it just doesn't make sense.\n \n You consider all homosexuals at risk because of the actions of a few, yet when people start murdering homosexuals, those are isolated incidents not representative of the group? You know better than that; homosexuality doesn't put you in danger, and opposing homosexuality doesn't put you in danger. The dangerous people are both subgroups or subcultures that are not representative of the whole.\n \n \nIf I were truly trying to impose on you, I would not have stated consistently here that you should have the benefits you need as couples. Instead, you're trying to use the law to redefine an institution already defined by society, and therefore imposing on the morality of many people. As far as I'm concerned, you are more than entitled to the benefits couples need--that's not even at issue here even though you keep invoking it.

(And yes, I DO believe homosexual living is immoral, but from the legal and rights standpoint, again you are entitled to couples' benefits as I have stated several times)\n\n \n Opposite-sex couples are already imposing. The fact that you are trying to leave marriage as it is means that you are enforcing that imposition, and the fact that I am trying to change it means that I am attacking that imposition. You do wish to impose less than others because you do say that homosexuals should have the benefits of marriage. But by refusing the name, you are still imposing, you are still giving yourself more, and you are still immoral.\n \n I understand that marriage doesn't apply to homosexuals right now. So perhaps a key point is this: Heterosexuals do not deserve more than homosexuals. Because of this, we should not have any institution in our law which applies to heterosexuals but does not apply to homosexuals, and so long as we do, homosexuals are being treated unfairly.\n \n I do not care who is changing or redefining what we currently have in place. I care about treating people fairly.",

   "Societal \"standards and beliefs\" still have to be constitutional. My Question still applies: if the sexes are equal under the law, why does marriage involved two different ones? We already know that procreation, the ability to procreate, and/or the ability to mimic procreative sex is not a prerequisite for any marriage anywhere in this country. That said marriages restricted by gender participants are inherently unconstitutional.\n\n I don't get the jump in logic, I think you need to explain your position better.\n \n Noone can be denied equal protection under the law based on their sex. Because the law does not on its face discriminate (such as by saying \"Women don't get the benefits of marriage\"), it is constitutional.\n \n Where does the inequality come from?",

   "Funny. I always thought that the 13th Amendment freed the slaves.\n\n \n You are correct that the 13th granted slaves freedom. However the need for the 14th came up because of the issue that those freed slaves needed to be given the benefits of citizenship. \n \n \nMy Question still applies: if the sexes are equal under the law, why does marriage involved two different ones?\n\n \n You're question is a bit vague, but I think you are asking why there would be separate marriage for both gay people straight people. Remember, as far as the govt. is concerned the only thing this is really about is couples' benefits. They are equal as you say in the sense that all people have the same rights to couples' benefits. But society at large still determines what institutions apply as well as defining those institutions. In the case of marriage, society has defined it as being an opposite sex institution. I don't think it should be redefined, but I'd be in favor of you getting the benefits you have the rights to via a non-heterosexual institution.\n \n \nI really can go marry an opposite-sex partner, just like I really could go change my religion or my skin color or my hair color. But the mere fact that I must change in order to get a right is precisely what makes this right unfair and unequal. I should not have to change to get a right, I should not have to stop being homosexual to get the same rights that you have, and that is precisely what you are suggesting.\n\n \n You are correct--you should not have to change and/or stop being gay to get a right. And so you are indeed entitled to couples' benefits. But you are not fighting for equal protection (which would give you these benefits), but for the institution of marriage as it is to include gays. That is an imposition on the morality and standards of society, and an unnecessary one IMO, as I think you should be granted those benefits regardless via a non-heterosexal institution.\n \n \nMy inability to grow palm trees in Alaska isn't really a restriction, since I am not disallowed from growing palm trees in Alaska, they just won't grow if I try it. If you consider that a restriction, it is a restriction which cannot be changed, and as such, it is not important to discuss whether or not we should change it. However, it is very possible to change a legal institution\n\n \n The thing is, if you change marriage to include non-heterosexual couples, it's not really marriage anymore, by society's standards. You'd be calling something a marriage when it's really not. The \"legal institution\" is based on how society defines marriage, as they define it to be heterosexual. Again, the issue is not whether or not you should or shouldn't have rights to couples' benefits--we're well past that issue and we both agree that you should. The issue is whether or not it's right to impose upon the morality of society to change it's definition of an institution redefining it into something else. You keep invoking the idea that it's unfair but we're not talking about fairness because I'm in favor of you getting the same benefits married people get. That IS fair treatment. It IS equal protection. You are really only arguing over the means, not the end result. And it is wrong for you to impose your preferred means onto society's morals.\n \n \nI'm not necessarily saying that we should let small groups or individuals decide our institutions,\n\n \n But that's exactly what you're tring to do.\n \n \nIt started as a small minority, but it is no longer a small minority, it is a slight minority. We are trying to redefine an institution for the majority\n\n \n Why would you want to impose and change a cultural institution that doesn't even apply to you? Why would you want to be so vindictive? You might as well be trying to take away the cultural identity of native Americans or black people. Or (if you'd prefer a majority example), trying to insist that women not have any women-only conferences instead of simply having men's conferences. \n \n \nMarriage is an institution created by the majority to serve the majority. If you will not change it to serve everyone, then you must remove it from our laws or you are immoral\n\n \n No. You see, from a legal standpoint, all that is really at stake here are couples' benefits. That all. If you get those benefits without redefining marriage (as is the moral way of doing it because it doesn't impose your morality on others), then you will have equal protection. But from a cultural and societal standpoint, a time-honored cultural identity is at stake. And THAT is why you are so opposed on this by so many people; if you were only arguing for gay marriage, it would be fine (by me anyway). But you aren't--you are insisting on changing a social institution to fit what you want it to be as the only vehicle for equal protection. And that's wrong.\n \n \nWhy do you deserve a special legal institution that I do not? Why do you deserve a special legal institution that I do not? Why do you deserve a special legal institution that I do not?\n\n \n I don't deserve couples' benefits (which IS the legal institution) any more than you. But you don't get to change society-at-large's social institutions (marriage) to get them, either.\n \n \nYou consider all homosexuals at risk because of the actions of a few, yet when people start murdering homosexuals, those are isolated incidents not representative of the group? You know better than that; homosexuality doesn't put you in danger, and opposing homosexuality doesn't put you in danger. The dangerous people are both subgroups or subcultures that are not representative of the whole.\n\n \n Opposition to something harmful can't be wrong just because it might incite people to go too far. You might as well be arguing that Britain shouldn't take steps toward stopping another terror attack because it might incite harm against potential terrorists. (I don't think gay people are terrorists, so please don't take the analogy that way.) Sorry, but I'm not convinced that homosexual living does not have too much potential for harm just because you know how to engage in a harmful way of living safely. It's still a bad idea to run into a burning building regardless of the fire suit you may have learned to wear.\n \n \nOpposite-sex couples are already imposing. The fact that you are trying to leave marriage as it is means that you are enforcing that imposition\n\n \n How can I be imposing on you when I am FOR you getting couples' benefits? I have said this over and over. THAT'S the legal issue at stake here. Society shouldn't have to have it's cultural institutions imposed upon for you to get that.",

That is an imposition on the morality and standards of society, and an unnecessary one IMO, as I think you should be granted those benefits regardless via a non-heterosexal institution.\n\n \n It is not an imposition on the morality and standards of society because the morality and standards of society are left unchanged by legalizing same-sex marriage. Those who follow those morals and standards are left unpunished, unharmed, and unchanged legally in any way whatsoever. There is no imposition on the morals and standards of society.\n \n And more importantly, I am suggesting that the morals and standards of society should change because they are wrong; if they did that, then your same logic could be used to say that society is being imposed on by denying same-sex marriage.\n \n However, marriage is a right. As soon as you put it into law, it becomes a right. You cannot say that I am entitled to a right then follow it up by saying that I am not entitled to it. You are saying that I am entitled to almost every right, but that you want to keep the name for yourself, you want to seperate same-sex and opposite-sex couples under the law. And that is not right.\n \n \nThe thing is, if you change marriage to include non-heterosexual couples, it's not really marriage anymore, by society's standards. You'd be calling something a marriage when it's really not. The \"legal institution\" is based on how society defines marriage, as they define it to be heterosexual.

It IS equal protection. You are really only arguing over the means, not the end result. And it is wrong for you to impose your preferred means onto society's morals.\n\n \n It is neither fair treatment nor equal protection to give yourself a special title denied to same-sex couples, to give yourself a special legal institution denied to same-sex couples. Seperate is not equal, not when seperate could be changed to the same.\n \n I personally could not care less whether the definition of any word needs to be changed to do this. It is not infringing on any person's happiness, wellbeing, freedom, or equality to change the definition of a word. In fact, it is evil not to change the definition of a word if the current defintion creates inequality.\n \n However, legalizing same-sex marriage has nothing to do with changing the definition of anything except a legal institution. As I've said before, the legal institution of \"welfare\" has nothing to do with the definition of the word. The definition of a word will always mean nothing more and nothing less than the listener interprets it to mean.\n \n \nBut that's exactly what you're tring to do.\n\n \n We're also trying to become the majority. It doesn't matter whether we're the majority or minority.\n \n \nWhy would you want to impose and change a cultural institution that doesn't even apply to you? Why would you want to be so vindictive? You might as well be trying to take away the cultural identity of native Americans or black people. Or (if you'd prefer a majority example), trying to insist that women not have any women-only conferences instead of simply having men's conferences. \n\n \n In the paragraph you quoted, I mistakenly typed \"are\" instead of \"aren't\". My point was that it doesn't matter whether we are the minority or the majority, we are trying to redefine this legal institution because doing so is a moral act. It helps people. It makes people equal. We are trying to change the legal institution, and if that means we must change the cultural institution first, then we will do so. It is not vindictive to change the minds of the people through persuasion, nor is it vindictive to change our laws so that they treat everyone the same.\n \n I'm not quite certain of your examples... I can say, however, that if the cultural identity of Native Americans was harmful, I would try to convince them that they are wrong. I can also say that if women were trying to create a special legal institution called \"women-only conferences\", I would say, \"that is unfair and unequal, the legal institution can only morally exist as 'conferences'\". As I have said in the past, if \"marriage\" means opposite-sex, then we must change the name of the institution for everyone.\n \n \nNo. You see, from a legal standpoint, all that is really at stake here are couples' benefits. That all. If you get those benefits without redefining marriage (as is the moral way of doing it because it doesn't impose your morality on others), then you will have equal protection. But from a cultural and societal standpoint, a time-honored cultural identity is at stake. And THAT is why you are so opposed on this by so many people; if you were only arguing for gay marriage, it would be fine (by me anyway). But you aren't--you are insisting on changing a social institution to fit what you want it to be as the only vehicle for equal protection. And that's wrong.\n\n \n This is not true at all. First, from a legal standpoint, we are creating two seperate legal institutions, which means that our law recognizes same-sex couples as having different rights than opposite-sex couples. In the case of civil unions, same-sex couples would actually have less rights than opposite-sex couples. That is the legal truth of what you are trying to create.\n \n If society wanted to preserve a time-honored cultural institution which is exclusive, then it must be willing to do one of three things: First, it could not put that institution into law. Second, it could create that institution under law using a different name so that it applies to everyone. Or third, it could expand the legal defintion of that institution to apply fairly to everyone while maintaining its cultural interpretation of the institution. However, if a society puts an exclusive institution into law, and it is unwilling to extend that institution to others who need it, then that society is committing moral evil; it is putting its own beliefs, it's own lifestyles into law, and it is elevating some people over others.\n \n \nI don't deserve couples' benefits (which IS the legal institution) any more than you. But you don't get to change society-at-large's social institutions (marriage) to get them, either.\n\n \n The title of marriage is a benefit. So long as the law recognizes your union as a marriage but mine as somethihng else, you have a legal benefit that I do not have. You do not deserve a special title. You do not deserve more. And you must change the law so that it does not give you any more than it gives anyone else.\n \n Society may have legal institutions, but you're not talking about all of society, you're talking about the majority. You're saying that I don't get to change the majority's legal institutions to apply to the minority. Well I will state this right now: the majority should never have any legal institutions. Every legal institution must be designed for everyone. I am changing the majority's legal institution to apply to more peolpe, and I take pride in doing so because doing so is morally the right thing to do. \n \n \nOpposition to something harmful can't be wrong just because it might incite people to go too far. You might as well be arguing that Britain shouldn't take steps toward stopping another terror attack because it might incite harm against potential terrorists. (I don't think gay people are terrorists, so please don't take the analogy that way.) Sorry, but I'm not convinced that homosexual living does not have too much potential for harm just because you know how to engage in a harmful way of living safely. It's still a bad idea to run into a burning building regardless of the fire suit you may have learned to wear.\n\n \n Yet I can say exactly the same thing about you. You've learned to criticize homosexuals without killing them. Sorry, but I'm not convinced that opposition to homosexuality does not have too much potential for harm, just because you know how to engage in a harmful way of living safely. It's still a bad idea to run into a burning build regardless of the fire suit you're wearing.\n \n I agree that your opposition homosexuality can't be wrong just because it might incite people to go too far. But in the same fashion, my support of homosexuality can't be wrong just because it might incite people to go too far. Someone else who opposes gay rights might kill gay people. Someone else who is bisexual might run off and have promiscuous sex or commit suicide. But that doesn't mean that it's wrong to oppose gay rights just as it doesn't mean that it's wrong to be gay.\n \n You focus on harmful actions of individual gay people, and you generalize that harm across all gay people. Yet when someone focuses on harmful actions of gay rights opponents and tries to generalize that harm across all gay rights opponents, you'll write all day about how wrong they are. Both are almost exactly the same situations. The only difference is that my support of same-sex marriage will discourage STD's and suicide while your opposition to homosexuality will not discourage violence against gay people.\n \n You're not the only one who is wrong here. Those who point out violence against gays and blame that on you are wrong. Both sides do the same thing. Learn to see above that; learn to evaluate the situation objectively. Generalizing the harmful actions of individuals across entire groups of people will never be logically sound.\n \n \nHow can I be imposing on you when I am FOR you getting couples' benefits? I have said this over and over. THAT'S the legal issue at stake here. Society shouldn't have to have it's cultural institutions imposed upon for you to get that.\n\n \n You are for granting more couples benefits than we have now, but you are not for granting all couples benefits. You keep a single benefit for yourself, the title. Majorities in the past have committed the worst of atrocities against minorities, they have taken the lives of minorities, they have taken everything. You are the opposite of that extreme. You seek to take the least significant right possible from minorities. But you still seek to have more than them. Even though you are on the opposite side of the spectrum, you are still wrong; even the least of rights, even a special title, is required for equality.\n \n As I said above, the majority may have cultural institutions, but legal institutions are for everyone. I seek to change the majority's legal institution into society's legal institution, and that is not imposition, it is morality.",

Some of our civil rights are granted to us by the Constitution, some of our civil rights are granted to us by bills.

Unless there is a good reason to deny equality, we should not do it.\n \n Now, the way you used the word \"right\" is the wrong way. You use it to mean \"inalienable right\".

Which is no doubt why your movement wants to change the standard, not just get equal protection (couples' benefits).\n \n \n then your same logic could be used to say that society is being imposed on by denying same-sex marriage.\n\n \n That's exactly right--it IS being imposed on by your movement because you are effectively expecting society to change it's beliefs. That's not your right.\n \n \nHowever, marriage is a right. As soon as you put it into law, it becomes a right.\n \n \n Benefits are indeed a right, I agree with you. But that's really all this is about<b></b>: benefits. Remember, there is really no such thing as \"marriage\" in a legal sense--it's really just the govt. granting benefits to opposite sex couples who enter into a union. They are called 'marriage benefits' because couples get them for being married, which the govt. recognizes.\n \n \nYou are saying that I am entitled to almost every right, but that you want to keep the name for yourself, you want to seperate same-sex and opposite-sex couples under the law. \n\n \n That is correct; it should remain separate, because they are not the same thing. You are same-sex couples, we are opposite-sex couples. However, their benefits (equal protection as guranteed by the constitution) should not be separate as that would be \"seperate-but-equal\"--you should get the same benefits we do. \n \n \nIt is neither fair treatment nor equal protection to give yourself a special title denied to same-sex couples, to give yourself a special legal institution denied to same-sex couples. \n\n \n Why would you want an opposite-sex institution title? You aren't in opposite-sex relationships. Why wouldn't you want an accurate one?\n \n \nSeperate is not equal, not when seperate could be changed to the same.\n\n \n Agreed, that's why you need the same benefits. We should drink from the same water fountain.\n \n \nHowever, legalizing same-sex marriage has nothing to do with changing the definition of anything except a legal institution. \n\n \n This is where you are terribly wrong, and I wish so much you could see that. Govt. benefits for couples are based on a society cultural standard (opposite-sex is marriage). Now, it's wrong to only give such benefits for one group, which is why benefits should be extended to gay people too. But your movement is seeking to gain those benefits ONLY by changing society's definition of marriage since that's what govt. benefits are based on. That's the criteria.\n \n \nIn the paragraph you quoted, I mistakenly typed \"are\" instead of \"aren't\". \n\n \n Ok, I understand--I have typos sometimes too. I still don't agree that needlessly changing society's standards by a minority over a majority is the moral thing to do. It's really a draconian thing to do.\n \n \nIn the case of civil unions, same-sex couples would actually have less rights than opposite-sex couples. That is the legal truth of what you are trying to create.\n\n \n That's not the sort of civil rights I'd be for at all. \n \n \nIf society wanted to preserve a time-honored cultural institution which is exclusive, then it must be willing to do one of three things:\n\n \n But society isn't making it exclusive. It's exclusive because of what it is. It's exclusive because there's a difference between the couple's union that is opposite-sex, and the couple's union that is same-sex. (the difference being the gender make-up of the couple, of course) There is another option from the ones you listed: that option is to also give same-sex couples benefits based on their OWN criteria instead of someone else's (that 'someone else' being opposite-sex couples). That wouldn't be 'separate-but-equal since both types of relationships are getting the same benefits (or drinking from the same fountains, so to speak).\n \n \nThe title of marriage is a benefit. So long as the law recognizes your union as a marriage but mine as somethihng else, you have a legal benefit that I do not have.\n\n \n That's because the govt. only recognizes that one title as criteria for giving the benfits. That should be changed.\n \n \nYou do not deserve a special title. You do not deserve more. \n \n \n Then you do not deserve the title of 'gay' or 'homeowner' or whatever. It wouldn't change the fact that you ARE gay, or ARE a homeowner (though you may really not be, but you get my point). It's just a title. We should grant benefits for your title as well, and give you equality. \n \n \nAnd you must change the law so that it does not give you any more than it gives anyone else.\n\n \n Absolutely! We should have the same benefits.\n \n \nYou're saying that I don't get to change the majority's legal institutions to apply to the minority. \n\n \n No, I'm saying you don't get to change the majority's cultural institutions to apply to the minority. If you were only trying to change the legal one, you'd simply be for getting benfits.\n \n \nYet I can say exactly the same thing about you. You've learned to criticize homosexuals without killing them. Sorry, but I'm not convinced that opposition to homosexuality does not have too much potential for harm, just because you know how to engage in a harmful way of living safely. It's still a bad idea to run into a burning build regardless of the fire suit you're wearing.\n\n \n Fair enough, we all have our opinions. That's what makes this a forum. :) I respect yours very much.\n \n \nYou focus on harmful actions of individual gay people, and you generalize that harm across all gay people. Yet when someone focuses on harmful actions of gay rights opponents and tries to generalize that harm across all gay rights opponents, you'll write all day about how wrong they are. Both are almost exactly the same situations.\n\n \n I assure you my intentions aren't to generalize but to simply say what I believe is the case. There's no motive here to generalize anythinng--I'm simply stating my views. I know you'll never agree with that, and that's your prerogative. I will definitely state however that some gay rights opponents go too far and direct their opposition toward people instead of actions.\n \n \nYou are for granting more couples benefits than we have now, but you are not for granting all couples benefits. You keep a single benefit for yourself, the title. \n\n \n If the criteria to GET benefits is in itself a benefit, then I guess you could look at it that way. But I think you should have a beneficial criteria as well that would give you couples' benefits too.",

   "All right, apparently there is some huge misconception about what a right is.

   "No they are not. Legal marriage is based on that societal standard. Which is no doubt why your movement wants to change the standard, not just get equal protection (couples' benefits).\n\n \n Legal marriage is based on that societal standard, but it is not the same thing, and it should not have been. The motives of my movement are irrelevant to the morality of my movement.\n \n \nThat's exactly right--it IS being imposed on by your movement because you are effectively expecting society to change it's beliefs. That's not your right.\n\n \n I am trying to change the beliefs of society, and I am expecting them to change. But I'm not doing it by using the law to deny rights, I'm doing it by using my freedom of speech to change minds, to teach people. I am not doing what you are doing; I am not imposing.\n \n \nBenefits are indeed a right, I agree with you. But that's really all this is about<b></b>: benefits. Remember, there is really no such thing as \"marriage\" in a legal sense--it's really just the govt. granting benefits to opposite sex couples who enter into a union. They are called 'marriage benefits' because couples get them for being married, which the govt. recognizes.\n\n \n There is such a thing as \"marriage\" in a legal sense. It is a legal institution which you must join in order to get those benefits. If there were no such thing as \"marriage\" in a legal sense, then there would be no such thing as \"civil unions\" in a legal sense, and you would agree with me. Yet you are arguing that we put civil unions into law, that we create something legally different. That is the problem.\n \n \nThat is correct; it should remain separate, because they are not the same thing. You are same-sex couples, we are opposite-sex couples. However, their benefits (equal protection as guranteed by the constitution) should not be separate as that would be \"seperate-but-equal\"--you should get the same benefits we do.\n\n \n Legal rights do not make distinctions based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or any other differences two sets of people may hold. Yet you make an exception in this case. Why? It is not \"because they are not the same thing\", for we give countless people who are not the same as one another the same rights. It is because you want them legally recognized as \"not the same thing.\" You want it printed right in law that opposite-sex couples aren't legally the same as same-sex couples. And when that happens, equality is as surely destroyed as if you gave blacks civil unions or interracial couples civil unions. There is no equality in denying people the same rights that you have, and there never will be.\n \n \nWhy would you want an opposite-sex institution title? You aren't in opposite-sex relationships. Why wouldn't you want an accurate one?\n\n \n Because a title is only what people interpet it to mean. I've never interpreted marriage to have anything to do with opposite-sex couples. It's always been a union between two people who love each other. You're the one who says it it's only opposite-sex, and since I wouldn't dare want you to change your definition to include me, I suggested that we just use a term that you aren't so attached to. But I truly couldn't care less what \"marriage\" means, and I couldn't care less whether its meaning is consistant with its legal usage. All I really care about is giving everyone the same rights under the law.\n \n \nAgreed, that's why you need the same benefits. We should drink from the same water fountain.\n\n \n Then why don't you write that into the law? Why do you insist on creating a second water fountain and claiming it is the same thing? You're saying there an \"opposite-sex\" water fountain and an \"everyone\" water fountain. You're saying we need to seperate the legal rights. You're supporting two seperate legal institutions. You are not supporting the same thing.\n \n \nThis is where you are terribly wrong, and I wish so much you could see that. Govt. benefits for couples are based on a society cultural standard (opposite-sex is marriage). Now, it's wrong to only give such benefits for one group, which is why benefits should be extended to gay people too. But your movement is seeking to gain those benefits ONLY by changing society's definition of marriage since that's what govt. benefits are based on. That's the criteria.\n\n \n Government benefits are based on a society's cultural standard, that is true. But it doesn't mean that they should be, and it doesn't mean that changing those benefits will change society's standards. If it does mean that, then it will have been society that changed, through its own free will and reasoning. Changing the law is forces no cultural change. It is true that I am creating cultural change by trying to convince people that they are wrong, but such things happen all the time, and they are not immoral. Sometimes culture actually is wrong. Although the law shouldn't have the power to mandate whether a culture is right or wrong, it should allow individuals within the culture to discuss, debate, and change their minds on cultural issues.\n \n \nOk, I understand--I have typos sometimes too. I still don't agree that needlessly changing society's standards by a minority over a majority is the moral thing to do. It's really a draconian thing to do.\n\n \n Well, as I said, it's just me convincing people. The only reason I'm trying to convince people to change their standards is because that is the only way to get legal equality. If legal equality were granted, I would have no need to tell people how wrong their beliefs are.\n \n \nThat's not the sort of civil rights I'd be for at all.\n\n \n But it is what you are saying you are for.\n \n \nBut society isn't making it exclusive. It's exclusive because of what it is. It's exclusive because there's a difference between the couple's union that is opposite-sex, and the couple's union that is same-sex. (the difference being the gender make-up of the couple, of course) There is another option from the ones you listed: that option is to also give same-sex couples benefits based on their OWN criteria instead of someone else's (that 'someone else' being opposite-sex couples). That wouldn't be 'separate-but-equal since both types of relationships are getting the same benefits (or drinking from the same fountains, so to speak).\n\n \n That sort of thinking will lead to problems if the same institution is used for both groups. When that happens, people will start thinking \"we should give each institution benefits based on its own criteria, its own need.\" Then using some sort of twisted logic, they will decide that only opposite-sex couples need some benefit, they'll only give that benefit to opposite-sex couples, and the inequality will have begun anew.\n \n Further, as stated before, no one else has seperate rights because the people getting those rights are of different composition anywhere else in our law ever. The only purpose of such a thing could be to teach people that the two groups are of different value, and the minority group will suffer from that teaching every time.\n \n \nThat's because the govt. only recognizes that one title as criteria for giving the benfits. That should be changed.\n\n \n You're right! The criteria should be changed! We should extend that criteria to same-sex couples. What we should not do is create an entirely new institution with new criteria that everyone can get into or that only same-sex couples can get into. Both groups deserve access to the same benefits and the same institution.\n \n \nThen you do not deserve the title of 'gay' or 'homeowner' or whatever. It wouldn't change the fact that you ARE gay, or ARE a homeowner (though you may really not be, but you get my point). It's just a title. We should grant benefits for your title as well, and give you equality. \n\n \n I certainly don't deserve any legal title called \"gay\" or \"homeowner\", that's for certain, and there certainly shouldn't be any legal institution called \"gay people\" which gives benefits to gay people. If there were, I would say, \"let's let everyone get gay people benefits, and if the name is a problem, let's change the name.\" The last thing in the world I would say is, \"let's keep gay people benefits, but also make straight people benefits\". It makes no sense to give gay people and straight people different legal institutions except as an attempt to segregate the two, and that is precisely what you are trying to do.\n \n \nAbsolutely! We should have the same benefits.\n\n \n Yes.\n \n \nNo, I'm saying you don't get to change the majority's cultural institutions to apply to the minority. If you were only trying to change the legal one, you'd simply be for getting benfits.\n\n \n But the benefits are not all there is. There is also a legal name for those benfits, and that name is \"marriage\". If you create a different name, then you create different benefits, and different benefits will never be equal, no matter how similar they are.\n \n \nFair enough, we all have our opinions. That's what makes this a forum. :) I respect yours very much.\n\n \n Yet you clearly know that I don't believe, that, I specifically said that I could used your exact same argument against you, and showed you how. Instead of explaining how my usage of your own argument against you is not valid, you pretended that I was not issuing a logical attack against your argument at all. But that does not change the fact that you are wrong to say homosexuality is harmful in the same way that we are wrong to say opposing homosexuality is harmful.\n \n \nI assure you my intentions aren't to generalize but to simply say what I believe is the case. There's no motive here to generalize anythinng--I'm simply stating my views. I know you'll never agree with that, and that's your prerogative. I will definitely state however that some gay rights opponents go too far and direct their opposition toward people instead of actions.\n\n \n I understand that you are stating your views, that does nothing to indicate whether your views are right or wrong. By judging gay people using those views, then writing off the same problem present in opponents of same-sex marriae, you are engaging in \"hypocrisy\". You are evaulating gay people one way, and failing to use the same standard to evaluate yourself. You state that I am living harmful life because people similar to me in some arbitrary way are living harmful lives. Yet when others accuse you of the same thing, you deny it. Gay people who do the same are also hypocritical. In fact, I'll bet every person is hypocritical sometimes. But this isn't something that can be written off as a difference in views, it is a problem in the logic here.\n \n \nIf the criteria to GET benefits is in itself a benefit, then I guess you could look at it that way. But I think you should have a beneficial criteria as well that would give you couples' benefits too.\n\n \n I think the criteria should be \"opposite-sex and same-sex couples get these benefits:\". You are suggesting that the criteria should be \"opposite-sex couples get these benefits:\" and \"same-sex couples get these benefits:\". Then you call them equal by saying the lists underneath would be exactly the same.\n \n But with my way, we can't possibly ever make those lists different because they're referring to the same list; there is only one list. Making two lists, two institutions, is exactly what creating civil unions does. It's not fair; it's not just; it's merely a method of segregating gay people and straight people in our laws.",

Yet you make an exception in this case. Why?\n\n \n Well, this case is different IMO. We're not talking about, say, a school not admitting a black person. It's not the person that is the criteria, but the institution. The issue here is really marriage, not gay people. If the govt. recognizes another form of unions in the same way it does marriage, then I have no problem with that, as I've made myself clear.\n \n \nIt is not \"because they are not the same thing\", for we give countless people who are not the same as one another the same rights. It is because you want them legally recognized as \"not the same thing.\" You want it printed right in law that opposite-sex couples aren't legally the same as same-sex couples.\n\n \n No, I don't believe their unions are a marriage, because they aren't an opposite-sex union. It's not a value judgement on the couple or indivicuals. No one is making a judgement call about gay people in terms of worth here. It's simply a matter of such a union not constituting a marriage, since it's not opposite-sex. If there are any reflections on the worth of people in that, it's only the ones you are bringing into this.\n \n \nAnd when that happens, equality is as surely destroyed as if you gave blacks civil unions or interracial couples civil unions. \n\n \n But the issue of blacks doesn't deal with the make up of marriage in terms of what fundamentally IS a marriage. I'd agree it's discrimination against skin color in your example, but in the gay marriage case it's really about the make-up of a union. Why should we call something that's not a marriage a marriage?\n \n \nI've never interpreted marriage to have anything to do with opposite-sex couples. It's always been a union between two people who love each other.\n\n \n But you do not speak for society, and society has spoken.

I will say again that you are entitled to your opinion and yes I know you could try and use the same argument toward me as well. I don't think it's valid that direction, and you don't think it's valid your direction. That's fine, and we'll have to respectfully leave it at that. \n \n \nInstead of explaining how my usage of your own argument against you is not valid, you pretended that I was not issuing a logical attack against your argument at all.\n\n \n I'm not trying to pretend anything. I assure you I have been nothing but straightforward with you in every word I've posted.\n \n \nI understand that you are stating your views, that does nothing to indicate whether your views are right or wrong. By judging gay people using those views, then writing off the same problem present in opponents of same-sex marriae, you are engaging in \"hypocrisy\". \n\n \n With all due respect, bringing the arguments of opponents of gay marriage into play and examining them is a red herring to this discussion. I'd be glad to debate that with you in another thread. It's only natural for both of us in debate to believe 'I am right and the other person is wrong'--we wouldn't be here if it weren't for that. I believe the comments I made (which you call generalizations) are correct however.

   "Rights and the law are not the only thing in society that can be imposed upon. You are imposing on society's common beliefs, or trying to anyway. Some of us take that morality even more seriously than we do national rights.\n\n \n Listen, I'm not imposing. If I convince someone that their old ways were wrong, they've changed of their own free will. You're suggesting that I'm somehow wrong by using logic to change people's minds? It may be important to you that other people keep on agreeing with you, but really it's their choice.\n \n \nNot really (this is a common misconception in gay marriage debate)--the govt. recognizes a marriage and there are things that have to be in place for that marriage to be recognizable by the govt. (a clergyperson or public official, signatures, often a witness, etc. Varies per state). Saying \"marriage\" itself is a govt. institution is sort of like saying \"old age\" is a govt. insitution to get social security. It doesn't really work that way. The govt. recognizes certain criteria among people and gives benefits for that criteria. Social marriage as recognized by the govt (if it meets the criteria) is one such example.\n\n \n Okay, first of all, if the government is recognizing religious marriages, then there is no doubt that the first amendment of the Constitution is being violated. It is being violated a second time by refusing to acknowledge my religion's marriage while it acknowledge's yours.\n \n The government is not recognizing a religious institution of marriage. It is entering people into the government's institution of marriage at the same time that people religiously enter into marriage, and that is fact. There is a legal institution called \"marriage\", and people are entered into it when they fill out the necessary paperwork in whatever possibly-absurd fashion the state deems appropriate.\n \n There should be no debate about this. It is fact.\n \n \nWell, civil unions as they are now are a state-level construct only. So really there is no federal legal civil union OR marriage, only federal recogntion of marriage. And I think there should be recognition of your unions too, just not by changing society's view of marriage.\n\n \n That's great! I don't think we should change society's view of marriage either. But I have no other choice. In a democracy, I have to change people's minds if I want our laws to be changed. If people would be willing to make our laws equal without changing their views on marriage, I'd have no problem with that. If legislatures or judges did it, I'd have no problem with that. But that isn't happening, so I'm working to change people's minds. If the culture must be changed for legal equality, then so be it.\n \n \nWell, this case is different IMO. We're not talking about, say, a school not admitting a black person. It's not the person that is the criteria, but the institution. The issue here is really marriage, not gay people. If the govt. recognizes another form of unions in the same way it does marriage, then I have no problem with that, as I've made myself clear.\n\n \n Well why doesn't marriage distinguish between interracial couples and same-race couples? They're of different composition, right? Why doesn't it distinguish between couples of the same age and different ages? Why doesn't it distinguish between people of different ethnicities and of the same ethnicities? Why doesn't it distinguish between people of different religions and of the same religions? The only thing you want it to distinguish between is people of the same sex and of the opposite sex. Why do you want to make this distinction, but no others, if not to legally segregate homosexuals and heterosexuals.\n \n \nNo, I don't believe their unions are a marriage, because they aren't an opposite-sex union. It's not a value judgement on the couple or indivicuals. No one is making a judgement call about gay people in terms of worth here. It's simply a matter of such a union not constituting a marriage, since it's not opposite-sex. If there are any reflections on the worth of people in that, it's only the ones you are bringing into this.\n\n \n I don't care whether you believe their unions are a marriage. That should have no bearing on whether or not they are allowed into the same legal institution or not. The real question is why should there be different legal institutions? Why should there be a same-sex institution and an opposite-sex institution? Why can't we just have one institution for everyone; call it whatever you want?\n \n And if you are truly not bringing in any implications about the worth of the individuals, why do you not change your definition of marriage? Why do you think it is so important to keep marriage as it is, if not because you believe that opposite-sex couples need to be recognized above and beyond same-sex coupes? By segregating same-sex and opposite-sex couples, you bring in reflections on worth, and I seek to end that.\n \n \nBut the issue of blacks doesn't deal with the make up of marriage in terms of what fundamentally IS a marriage. I'd agree it's discrimination against skin color in your example, but in the gay marriage case it's really about the make-up of a union. Why should we call something that's not a marriage a marriage?\n\n \n So it really doesn't matter that same-sex couples are different from opposite-sex couples. So don't suggest that. What matters is that your definition of marriage is exclusive. Personally, I think same-sex marriage is possible, and even if it weren't, I don't care if we call something that's not a marriage a marriage. I also don't care if we have to redefine marriage; why shouldn't we? Isn't the only reason that you want to segregate same-sex and opposite-sex couples, homosexuals and heterosexuals?\n \n And again, even if there were some reason not to change the definition of marriage, and even if there is some reason not to call something that isn't a marriage a marriage, then I still do not see why the best solution isn't simply to change the name of the legal institution for everyone. As far as I can comprehend, the only reason we wouldn't do that is to segregate homosexual and heterosexuals. How am I wrong?\n \n \nBut you do not speak for society, and society has spoken. It says marriage is something more specific than that.\n\n \n The majority has said that, but they are not necessarily right. You condemn me first for trying to change the majority's mind, then you call their decision all-powerful. So basically, once the majority decides something, you think that people who believe differently have no place trying to change their minds? I disagree, and I will use the example of the majority deciding on slavery long ago. I would have worked to change their minds, and I would have worked to free the slaves even if the majority did not agree. The point is just that it doesn't matter what the majority says.\n \n \nNo, the benefits ARE the legal institution. The criteria is what would be different. I don't any other way to explain this than the way I have.\n\n \n Okay, first, the legal institution is called \"marriage\", and there is no doubt about that.\n \n But let's assume for a second that the benefits are the institution. How could you say that same-sex marriage is currently illegal? In fact, I'm perfectly capable of marrying a member of the same sex religously. \"Society\" has protected that for me. The only thing I'm disallowed is the legal benefits/recognition. So all I'd have to do is go the benefits; same-sex marriage is already legal. So precisely what are you arguing for? If the benefits are the only part of the law, then your argument that we shouldn't legalize same-sex marriage doesn't make any sense at all because the law doesn't include marriage. What precisely is a \"civil union\" according to you, if not a different legal institution with the same benefits?\n \n \nYes, but a minority should not decide that.\n\n \n What is morally right should be done, no matter who decides it. If I must change the culture of the majority to do what is morally right, then I will.\n \n \nSlippery slope fallacy.\n\n \n Well, you're right about this in a sense, but it is not exactly correct for a sort of complicated reason:\n \n Let's say we're talking about same-sex marriage leading to polygamous marriage. Making polygamous marriage legal means removing a restriction on the people from marrying more than one person. I say same-sex marriage won't lead to polygamous marriage and doesn't affect whether same-sex marriage is moral or not. That is all I must say; if we legalize same-sex marriage, the restriction on polygamous marriage will still be in place.\n \n Now, we are talking about same-sex marriage versus civil unions. It is true that creating two seperate institutions is placing a restriction on the people from marrying someone of the same-sex. However, creating two seperate institutions is also removing a restriction on our lawmakers. Unlike in the polygamous marriage example, creating civil unions necessitates that the restriction is removed. I am arguing the equivalent of \"If we allow polygamous marriage, people will engage in it.\" I am not arguing \"If we allow same-sex marriage, we'll suddenly want to allow polygamous marriage.\"\n \n Or perhaps a different way of thinking of it: legalizing same-sex marriage doesn't let anyone marry more than one person; the issues are unrelated. Our laws continue to restrict that. Creating civil unions does allow people to treat civil unions and marriages differently. Our laws will not continue to restrict that.\n \n I suppose, though, that we could pass some sort of law stating that civil unions and marriages must recieve the same benefits in every fashion, and that no law may be passed specific to one or the other, but not both. If that happened, the argument I listed there would be completely void (though it is only a secondary argument). Yet that has not ever been included in any civil union in the past.\n \n \nI'm not sure what you mean here. I will say again that you are entitled to your opinion and yes I know you could try and use the same argument toward me as well. I don't think it's valid that direction, and you don't think it's valid your direction. That's fine, and we'll have to respectfully leave it at that. \n\n \n The same argument cannot be valid in one direction but invalid in another. I don't think it's valid in either direction, and I've done my best to make that clear.\n \n \nI'm not trying to pretend anything. I assure you I have been nothing but straightforward with you in every word I've posted.\n\n \n All right, then you misinterpreted what I wrote. I gave an example of how your own argument could be used against you, and you took it to mean that I actually believed your own argument could be used against you. Realistically, it can't be used against either of us. Here is what I wrote:\n \n \"Yet I can say exactly the same thing about you. You've learned to criticize homosexuals without killing them. Sorry, but I'm not convinced that opposition to homosexuality does not have too much potential for harm, just because you know how to engage in a harmful way of living safely. It's still a bad idea to run into a burning build regardless of the fire suit you're wearing.\n \n I agree that your opposition homosexuality can't be wrong just because it might incite people to go too far. But in the same fashion, my support of homosexuality can't be wrong just because it might incite people to go too far. Someone else who opposes gay rights might kill gay people. Someone else who is bisexual might run off and have promiscuous sex or commit suicide. But that doesn't mean that it's wrong to oppose gay rights just as it doesn't mean that it's wrong to be gay.\"\n \n \nWith all due respect, bringing the arguments of opponents of gay marriage into play and examining them is a red herring to this discussion. I'd be glad to debate that with you in another thread. It's only natural for both of us in debate to believe 'I am right and the other person is wrong'--we wouldn't be here if it weren't for that. I believe the comments I made (which you call generalizations) are correct however. Comparisons to anti0gay groups and their arguments is an unrelated matter to the context of this particular discussion we are having.\n\n \n But those comparisons are analogys that help me show why you are wrong in our current discussion. Of course I agree that comparisons to violent anti-gay people aren't representative of you. But I don't understand how you can say that, then proceed to say that comparisons with promiscuous gays are representative of me.\n \n \nI don't see any more reason to assume I am being harmful than for you to assume you are being harmful.\n\n \n You're right! You shouldn't believe you're being harmful because of violent anti-gay people, and I shouldn't believe I'm being harmful because of promiscuous gay people. Neither of us is being harmful for those reasons (though you're still being harmful by failing to support equal legal rights!)\n \n \nThere is only one list under my way too, we just don't use the same criteria for those benefits.\n\n \n But there isn't only one list under your way. There are marriages, and there are civil unions under your way, and they are seperate. They are not the same thing, as stated by you. Let them be the same thing. Destroy this segregation. Allow same-sex couples the same legal rights you give yourself. Why keep a legal institution for only opposite-sex couples?",

   "Okay, first of all, if the government is recognizing religious marriages, then there is no doubt that the first amendment of the Constitution is being violated.\n\n \n If that were true, then clergy would not have the status of being able to legally sign wedding certificates. (interestingly, so DO think and argue this is a breach of church and state.) The govt. recognizes religious entites all the time--every time they give a church tax-free status, for instance. Maybe that's against church and state, but that's a whole separate debate.\n \n \nThere is a legal institution called \"marriage\", and people are entered into it when they fill out the necessary paperwork in whatever possibly-absurd fashion the state deems appropriate.\n \n There should be no debate about this. It is fact.\n\n \n Ok, show me where the law says that there is an legal institution of marriage. Other govt. institutions are clearly laid out in our law and govt. documents--where is this govt. institution to be read about govt. policy? I'd love to read it. For all practical purposes, there is no entity on the part of the govt. called marriage--it's just the govt. recognizing marriage--period. And it doesn't have to be religious, BTW; most states will recognize the commitment made as long as there is witness signature and the signature of a public official. The states determine the criteria by which the unions in each will be recognized as marriage, and then the federal govt. grants benefits based on who the states recognize as being married. THEM'S the facts.\n \n \nThat's great! I don't think we should change society's view of marriage either. But I have no other choice. In a democracy, I have to change people's minds if I want our laws to be changed. \n \n \n I'm glad you are seeing this. You are correct that you need to convince society (the majority) that what you want to do is the right way.\n \n \nWell why doesn't marriage distinguish between interracial couples and same-race couples? They're of different composition, right? Why doesn't it distinguish between couples of the same age and different ages? Why doesn't it distinguish between people of different ethnicities and of the same ethnicities? Why doesn't it distinguish between people of different religions and of the same religions? The only thing you want it to distinguish between is people of the same sex and of the opposite sex. \n \n \n These are all traits that reflect on the people--in all of them the fundamental fact that marriage is opposite-sex is still there. But in the case of same-sex marriage, the very definition of marriage is challenged, and therefore it's a changing of the institution of marriage itself. Also, gender match is a facet of marriage that run far, far deeper and more fundamental in society's thinking than any of the issues you listed. I think society SHOULD be able to decide it's institutions even taking it's beliefs into account.\n \n \nI don't care whether you believe their unions are a marriage. That should have no bearing on whether or not they are allowed into the same legal institution or not.\n\n \n Yet it does have a bearing, whether you like it or not, because I'm a part of the majority. But you're right in that it should have no bearing on getting couple's benefits!\n \n \nAnd if you are truly not bringing in any implications about the worth of the individuals, why do you not change your definition of marriage?\n\n \n Because it's sacred, IMO. Too sacred to be broadened so much. I would not insist that you change an institution that's sacred to gay people to include others--so why would you insist we change an institution that's sacred to us?\n \n \nWhy do you think it is so important to keep marriage as it is, if not because you believe that opposite-sex couples need to be recognized above and beyond same-sex coupes? \n\n \n You are the one making this into a hierarchy of 'worth' when it comes to couples. As far as I'm concerned this is simply a reflection on our differences, which ARE there whether you want to admit it or not. I don't view your union the same as mine. But that doesn't mean I view it as inferior. I'm not judging you, I'm simply wanting what belongs to straight people to continue to be there's. It's senseless to change a scared institution when it doesn't have to happen that way.\n \n \nSo it really doesn't matter that same-sex couples are different from opposite-sex couples. So don't suggest that. \n\n \n It still matters, even though there's no issue of worth here.\n \n The majority has said that, but they are not necessarily right. You condemn me first for trying to change the majority's mind, then you call their decision all-powerful. So basically, once the majority decides something, you think that people who believe differently have no place trying to change their minds? I disagree, and I will use the example of the majority deciding on slavery long ago. I would have worked to change their minds, and I would have worked to free the slaves even if the majority did not agree. The point is just that it doesn't matter what the majority says.\n \n \nBut let's assume for a second that the benefits are the institution. How could you say that same-sex marriage is currently illegal?\n\n \n I'm not saying that.\n \n \nIn fact, I'm perfectly capable of marrying a member of the same sex religously.\n\n \n Yep, you are correct. You will not be arrested for that.\n \n \nThe only thing I'm disallowed is the legal benefits/recognition. So all I'd have to do is go the benefits; same-sex marriage is already legal.\n\n \n Correct. But it's not marriage. You can call it marriage if you want, but it's not opposite-sex so it's not marriage. Call it something equally as sacred as far as I'm concerned, but the institution of marriage applies to opposite-sex people in my view.\n \n \nWhat precisely is a \"civil union\" according to you, if not a different legal institution with the same benefits?\n\n \n Well I don't know that it should be called \"civil unions\" anyway as that would be something that straight couples can have to which wouldn't be fair. But in my view there is no real institution of marriage by the govt. (can you point me to where it's laid out specifically in law?)--this is really a case of the govt. simply giving benefits for both types of unions: marriages and whatever you want to call gay unions. \n \n \nWhat is morally right should be done, no matter who decides it.\n\n \n That's easy to say, but you're not the moral authority for our society. For better or for worse, it's the majority.\n \n \nOr perhaps a different way of thinking of it: legalizing same-sex marriage doesn't let anyone marry more than one person; the issues are unrelated. Our laws continue to restrict that. Creating civil unions does allow people to treat civil unions and marriages differently. Our laws will not continue to restrict that.\n\n \n Well, civil unions in the sense of something both gaypeople AND straight could have is not what I'm talking about.\n \n \nOf course I agree that comparisons to violent anti-gay people aren't representative of you. But I don't understand how you can say that, then proceed to say that comparisons with promiscuous gays are representative of me.\n\n \n I didn't say that. I never said that because there are promiscuous gays that you will probably be promiscuous. What I said is that homosexual living has more capacity for harm. That's not a generalization about gay people, it's a statement about homosexual living. There is a difference between saying a way of doing things has more capacity for problems than saying homosexuals are more likely to have problems. Again, I think you are talking too many of my comments as value judgements on people when I'm not really talking about people.",

It's not necessarily an opinion poll. \n \n \nThese are all traits that reflect on the people--in all of them the fundamental fact that marriage is opposite-sex is still there.\n\n \n Because we were not changing the definition of sex, we were changing other definitons.\n \n \nBut in the case of same-sex marriage, the very definition of marriage is challenged, and therefore it's a changing of the institution of marriage itself.\n\n \n The definition of sex, that's all. We could just as well say those other changes of definitions were changing the institution as people saw it, just not in the way of sex, however in other ways.\n \n \nAlso, gender match is a facet of marriage that run far, far deeper and more fundamental in society's thinking than any of the issues you listed.\n\n \n That's your opinion that it's deeper. When inter-racial marriages were being challenged, that same race defintion was considered fundamental. Popular opinon was against it. Judges talked about how God had put the races on different continents, because God did not want them to mix. That was a real battle in society, in the courts. The same race definition must have been considered fundamental at that time.\n \n \nBecause it's sacred, IMO. Too sacred to be broadened so much.\n\n \n Too sacred to broaden it to gays, you mean. That's all we are talking about here. Why can't gay people be included in, share in, contribute to, and equally appreciate what you hold sacred? \n \n \nI would not insist that you change an institution that's sacred to gay people to include others--so why would you insist we change an institution that's sacred to us?\n\n \n Gay people welcome straight people with open arms.\n \n \nYou are the one making this into a hierarchy of 'worth' when it comes to couples.

It's senseless to change a scared institution when it doesn't have to happen that way.\n\n \n What is the difference between a straight union and a gay one? Marriage will continue to belong to straight people, but also to gay people. Expanding who can share in marriage, doesn't prevent people from belonging to that institution.\n \n \nThat's easy to say, but you're not the moral authority for our society. For better or for worse, it's the majority.\n\n \n There's also the court.\n \n \nI didn't say that. I never said that because there are promiscuous gays that you will probably be promiscuous. What I said is that homosexual living has more capacity for harm. That's not a generalization about gay people, it's a statement about homosexual living.\n\n \n What in the hell is \"homosexual living\" exactly? Is there one kind or many different kinds of \"homosexual living\"? Jaxian may not be involved with \"homosexual living\", even though he is gay? Are the gay couples you want to give benefits to involved in so-called harmful \"homosexual living\"? If so, is that why you reason they should have benefits but not marriage? How would giving benefits but not marriage result in less harm? Who else besides gay people would be involved in gay living, by the way?\n \n \nThere is a difference between saying a way of doing things has more capacity for problems than saying homosexuals are more likely to have problems. Again, I think you are talking too many of my comments as value judgements on people when I'm not really talking about people.\n\n \n I guess you won't mind me saying that in general, \"straight living\" sucks, and you won't take that as a generalization about straight people who would be the ones involved in straight living? What if I generalized negative things about \"Christian living\", you wouldn't take that as an insult as a Christian? Who else would be involved with \"Christian living\", besides Christians?",

The government should not be making up some new name for same-sex unions, it should just be recognizing them. Creating some new legal name for same-sex unions would make no sense if there is no currnet legal name for opposite-sex unions. If what you say were actually true, the idea that we should create \"civil unions\" for gay people would make absolutely no sense, and my argument would be virtually infalliable.\n \n \nI'm glad you are seeing this. You are correct that you need to convince society (the majority) that what you want to do is the right way.\n\n \n Weren't you condemning me for trying to do this earlier?\n \n \nThese are all traits that reflect on the people--in all of them the fundamental fact that marriage is opposite-sex is still there.

I think society SHOULD be able to decide it's institutions even taking it's beliefs into account.\n\n \n Society should not be able to decide that it's legal institutions do not apply to certain minority groups without just cause. It should not create any institutions which provide special benefits for non-blacks, non-Muslims, non-Females, nor non-gays. Or at least it can be said that if society does decide such a thing, society has made a morally evil decision.\n \n Yet my question wasn't why \"marriage\" made a distinction between gay people and straight people. It was, \"why should we have a law that distinguishes between gay people and straight people?\" Why should marriage be put into law if it distinguishes between gay people and straight people, except to segregate the two?\n \n \nYet it does have a bearing, whether you like it or not, because I'm a part of the majority. But you're right in that it should have no bearing on getting couple's benefits!\n\n \n But it should have a bearing on whether or not our law is allowed to segregate the rights of gays and straights for no reason other than to segregate the two? I'm glad you agree that the majority shouldn't deny benefits to the minority, but they do. They also shouldn't create seperate names for the rights of minorities. But they want to.\n \n \nBecause it's sacred, IMO. Too sacred to be broadened so much. I would not insist that you change an institution that's sacred to gay people to include others--so why would you insist we change an institution that's sacred to us?\n\n \n If I tried to put a sacred gay person institution into the law, you should be opposing it. You should cry out. Gay people do not deserve a sacred right under the law any more than straight people do. If marriage is sacred to you, then don't put it into the law. Because once you do that, you've got to apply it to everyone, and that is the bottom line.\n \n \nYou are the one making this into a hierarchy of 'worth' when it comes to couples. As far as I'm concerned this is simply a reflection on our differences, which ARE there whether you want to admit it or not. I don't view your union the same as mine.

It's senseless to change a scared institution when it doesn't have to happen that way.\n\n \n I am the one saying that this creates a hierarchy of worth, and I'm saying it because it is true. I'm further saying it because it does. You stated yourself that marriage is sacred. You do not have a sacred institution for gays. So what you are saying is that you want a sacred, straight institution to be placed in our law. By putting what is considered by everyone to be a sacred intitution into our law, then denying it to gay people, we are elevating those who are not denied it above gay people.\n \n \nCorrect. But it's not marriage. You can call it marriage if you want, but it's not opposite-sex so it's not marriage. Call it something equally as sacred as far as I'm concerned, but the institution of marriage applies to opposite-sex people in my view.\n \n Well I don't know that it should be called \"civil unions\" anyway as that would be something that straight couples can have to which wouldn't be fair.

I could walk up to the same people, file the same paperwork, not specify my or my partner's gender, and leave with the same papers and the same certificate you have. That is precisely what I want. But that's not what civil unions are; that's not what gay rights opponents are arguing for. They want seperate legal papers, seperate documents, seperate certificates, and gender-dependant legal rights. The institution that grants those benefits under law is called \"marriage\". They want to create a seperate one called \"civil unions\". I don't care what the definitions of those words are; I just want the law to make both same-sex and opposite-sex unions recieve exactly the same treatment.\n \n \nThat's easy to say, but you're not the moral authority for our society. For better or for worse, it's the majority.\n\n \n That's true. Only by convincing the majority that their previous morality was wrong, and that happens by convincing individual people, such as you, that your morality was wrong.\n \n \nWell, civil unions in the sense of something both gaypeople AND straight could have is not what I'm talking about.\n\n \n Well it is what I'm talking about. But I'm also talking about getting rid of any special straight legal rights.\n \n \nI didn't say that. I never said that because there are promiscuous gays that you will probably be promiscuous. What I said is that homosexual living has more capacity for harm. That's not a generalization about gay people, it's a statement about homosexual living. There is a difference between saying a way of doing things has more capacity for problems than saying homosexuals are more likely to have problems. Again, I think you are talking too many of my comments as value judgements on people when I'm not really talking about people.\n\n \n You said that I'm living a dangerous lifestyle in a safe fashion. But what makes my lifestyle dangerous? As far as I can tell, the only reason you consider it dangerous is because some other gay people, people who are not me, do dangerous things. I'm not doing anything dangerous. But I can say that other gay rights opponents, people who are not you, do dangerous things. But you're not doing anything dangerous.\n \n So how does my life have more capacity for harm than yours? Neither one of us is doing anything dangerous. Homosexuality does not have any more capacity for harm than opposing homosexuality.\n \n Furthermore, I must present a question to everyone based on this quote:\n \nJaxian may not be involved with \"homosexual living\", even though he is gay\n\n \n Does being bisexual qualify as being both gay and straight? Or is it neither? Or is it one but not the other? I never figured this out...",

Same difference.

I have no idea what your lifestyles consist of.\n \n \nSo how does my life have more capacity for harm than yours?\n\n \n I assume it's because there is either a.) less tendency among people living a homosexual life to use proper safe-sex protection, or b.) because the particular sexual practices more likely to be used carry more possibility of STD infection regardless of protection. But I really don't want to get into some graphic comparison debate here about this. You aren't likely going to be able to convince me that this isn't a problem among the gay community when the stats clearly reveal otherwise, by giving the equivilent argument of \"oh that's only the people who don't wear firesuits who get burned when running through fire--a subset.\"\n \n \nDoes being bisexual qualify as being both gay and straight?

The government will grant marriage benefits to people who are not socially married, because social marriage is a religious thing. The government grants these benefits by creating a legal contract which puts two individuals into a legal agreement. That legal agreement is called \"marriage\", probably to reflect the fact that people with social marriages are generally the ones who use these benefits.\n \n What gay rights opponents are talking about doing is making a different legal agreement for gay people, called \"civil unions\". What I am talking about doing is making the same legal agreement for everyone to use. We can call my legal agreement whatever you want. It could be \"civil unions\", it could be \"marriage\", it could be \"the partner benefits agreement\", or it could be whatever is appropriate (or whatever is inappropriate; I don't care). But it should be the same agreement, leading to the same benefits for everyone.\n \n If we create \"civil unions\", we will be creating a different legal agreement, and nothing more. We will not be changing or \"protecting\" any aspect of social marriage; all we will be doing is creating a new legal agreement for gay people, and denying them access to the straight person's legal agreement. That is morally wrong; everyone should have access to the same legal agreement, and let society call people's unions whatever it wants.\n \n \nBut society itself decides what that 'just cause' is. Same difference. What you view as jst cause is not what others do.\n\n \n Society's opinion of what is just gets put into law, but that does not necessarily make it just. It is only society's opinion of what is just that wins.\n \n \nTo reflect the reality of the institution. Marriage IS a straight thing.\n\n \n Then it shouldn't be in our laws. We don't put \"blonde hair\" into law, then create a seperate set of benefits for \"brunette hair\", and a seperate set of benefits for \"red hair\". Everyone gets the same benefits. We don't need to \"reflect the reality of the situation\", we just give everyone the same benefits. That's the only way to be truly fair.\n \n \nAs long as the likewise straight institution is also recognized, why would I care? We're both getting the benefits we need. Again, I'm for both gay unions AND marriages to be recognized.\n\n \n You are for both to be recognized, but you're for them to be recognized differently under the law. The law should treat them the same, the exact same. It should not have certain legal agreements for straight people, and different legal agreements for gay people. They should all be the same thing. You should care because if we do not do this, we are not actually being fair, we are denying a legal title to gay people.\n \n \nHow so, if both types of unions are recognized equally?\n\n \n They are not recognized equally if one has a legal title that the other does not.\n \n \nI said homosexual living has more capacity for harm. I didn't say you were living a dangerous lifestyle. I have no idea what your lifestyles consist of.\n\n \n Well, I have spoken of my lifestyle, so you should have some idea, assuming I am telling the truth. Your words implied that if my lifestyle involves homosexuality, which it does, it is a dangerous one.\n \n \nI assume it's because there is either a.) less tendency among people living a homosexual life to use proper safe-sex protection, or b.) because the particular sexual practices more likely to be used carry more possibility of STD infection regardless of protection. But I really don't want to get into some graphic comparison debate here about this. You aren't likely going to be able to convince me that this isn't a problem among the gay community when the stats clearly reveal otherwise, by giving the equivilent argument of \"oh that's only the people who don't wear firesuits who get burned when running through fire--a subset.\"\n\n \n By that isn't my argument. My argument is, \"I'm not running through the fire. Just because some homosexuals are running through fire, doesn't mean we all are.\" Having sex with someone that doesn't have STD's brings with it no chance of me getting any STD's. There is no fire.\n \n I don't deny that more homosexuals aren't using proper protection. But I do deny that there is some \"tendency\" of gay people to not use protection. A tendency toward unsafe sex in gay people implies that we are somehow predisposed to having unsafe sex. But we aren't! Most of us are predisposed to having completely safe sex because we're really concerned about STD's.\n \n In the same fashion, I don't say that people opposed to homosexuality have a tendency to kill gay people. While it's true that there are some people opposed to homosexuality that kill people, this doesn't mean that you're \"running through fire in a firesuit\". So why are homosexuals?\n \n \nI tend to think it's a bad idea to try and catagorize people into labeled boxes in the first place, but that's just me.\n\n \n Isn't this ironic coming from someone who is so concerned with labelling marriages and non-marriages?",

The bottom line is I'm not arguing for you to have anything different than me--you'll get the same benefits.\n\n \n Any set of legal benefits offered by the governement is a government institution. This includes welfare, social security, and legal marriage. The bottom line is that you are arguing for something different. You are arguing for a different name for this institution. You cannot deny that.\n \n \nThen you are really trying to use an unrelated term (which happens to be a sacred one to many) to prevent you from having a stigma, which is an ulterior motive. To me that makes me all the more determined to oppose you.\n\n \n No, I have offered countless times to name it something different, and you should know that very well. The problem here is that you are determined to put a straight institution into law.\n \n The problem here is that you refuse to budge unless an institution exclusive to straight people is put into law, and you have provided no justification for that except \"they are different\", which amounts to a pile of nothing, for we do not use the law to recognize differences in people. There is no justification for putting this difference into law. There is no justification for segregating rights. There is no justification for choosing a single difference and point it out. There is no justification for putting your straights-only institution into law. There is no justification for using two different names. You have provided none.\n \n \nSo what? What difference does that make, esp. if opposite sex couples have to do that as well?\n\n \n The difference is that opposite-sex couples are part of the majority, and they aren't discriminated against. They don't have to fear being disapproved of by society, they don't have to fear violence, they don't have to fear hatred, and they don't have to fear \"marriage\" ever being seen as a negative thing.\n \n If that does not explain it, ask yourself what the difference would be if, before voting, a Muslim person had to check a little box indicating that he isn't here to \"vote\", he is here to make a \"ballot cast\". Imagine further the pride felt by non-Muslims, when they check that \"vote\" box. Can you not see how this situation is harmful, how it promotes segregation in our society, how it promotes hatred in our society? Can you not see why everyone should have the same thing?\n \n \nBut you are using examples of people, when we are really talking about an institution. The union is what's different here, IMO. I think one of the reasons this is such a controversial issue is that religious people put great stock in the institution of marriage; it's not about the people. And same-sex marriage isn't a marriage IMO.\n\n \n If you want to know the truth, I put a whole lot of stock into marriage myself, and it is my religious belief that marriage can be between two members of the same sex. Could you care less about my religious beliefs? I am offering up a solution that will protect your religious definition of marriage and mine. I do not care that the union is different. Our law does not recognize people's differences.\n \n And perhaps part of the problem is the large stock you put in marriage, that society puts into marriage. The problem is that they put this extremely large stock into opposite-sex marriage, and they do not put that same stock into same-sex marriage. If same-sex couples are given something different than marriage, society will not put the same stock into same-sex marriage that it puts into opposite-sex marriage. Now, I don't have a problem with society doing that. But I have a huge problem with our law being used as a tool to promote that belief.\n \n The real problem, I think, is that you put a huge stock into marriage, you do not hold the same opinion of same-sex marriage, and you want to write that disapproval into law.\n \n \nI wouldn't be afraid to admit I'm gay at all, but I'd still believe it was a wrong way to live. Nevertheless I'm not gay. And I don't see any reason why it would be a stigma at all to do what I am talking about.\n\n \n To understand why it would be a stigma, read what I wrote above. But I do think you would be afraid to admit that you are gay. Even as outspoken as I am, I am afraid to admit that I am bisexual to people. Perhaps you are braver than I.\n \n \nI don't think that's an applicable analogy. By your logic we should never question a behavior at all if there is anyone involved in it who are ending up harming themselves in the process. \n\n \n No, by my logic, we should only call a behavior harmful if it causes harm. Homosexuality does not cause STD's. Opposing homosexuality does not directly cause homosexuals to die. The real causes of these things are unsafe sex and muder. Oppose those things. If a homosexual isn't going to engage in unsafe sex, don't call his lifestyle harmful. And if an opponent of homosexuality isn't going to commit murder, then I won't say he's at a \"higher risk of murder\".\n \n \nLabeling the institution of marriage a certain is much more a matter of societal belief in what is sacred than having to do with gender.\n\n \n The majority is entitled to its beliefs, but if they try to put exclusive beliefs into law, they are morally evil.

There are also higher rates of HIV among non-whites, and low-income people.

Preventing sexual diseases, whether you were gay or straight, was not taken as seriously, as these were relatively easily cured. You went to the doctor and got a shot for it. Gay males having sex of course did not worry about pregnancy. Before HIV, condom use was never a part of gay culture, like it was with straight culture as a contraceptive. When gay men started using condoms on masse, HIV rates in the gay community dropped dramatically. The rates are no where near what they once were in the 1980s.",

Yours deserves nothing more, and if it currently has more, you should understand this and work to make it have only as much as any other religion.\n \n There is no legal right or institution that must be denied to certain people based on their sexual orientation.\n \n \nMuslims can already vote. This is a case more like someone who doesn't have voting rights NOW trying to broaden what voting is to make sure they're included. It would be more like teenagers above 13 (but below 18) demanded they be given the right to vote as well. (even though that's not really the same either, because they would still be voting the same way, whereas your relationships as gay people are not done the same way, they are same-sex).\n\n \n What does whether they can vote now have to do with it? If it is wrong to allow Muslims to vote, then it is wrong whether they can do it now or not. If it is right to allow them to vote, then it is right whether they can do it now or not.\n \n Furthermore, I can only fathom that those who oppose young teenagers voting might well start saying that \"voting is for people 18 and up, that's the definition of voting\". And they would have just as little support as you have for your case. They could as easily say, \"voting is for people 65 and up, that's the definition of voting\", and make precisely as much logical sense as the argument against same-sex marriage. I could say, \"marriage is between people of the same-sex, that's the definition of marriage\", and I would have an equal amount of logical support as you have. Definitions of a word are subjective to the person who hears them, and they can certainly be changed, so if there is a good reason to change them, then there had better be an even better reason to leave them the same. I have not heard that reason anywhere.\n \n \nFine, then why are you trying to force society to take your religious marriage beliefs over what's already there? You might as well be trying to tell Jewish people that they should call ALL hats any person wants to wear 'kippots', instead of just the traditional Jewish hats.\n\n \n No! I have no problem with Christians calling opposite-sex unions \"marriage\" and same-sex unions \"garbage\" if that's what they want to do. I'm trying only to make our laws the same. I'm trying only to give both groups the same name for their legal rights. The law does not determine the name of hats, and it does not determine the name of unions between two people, but it does determine the name of the benefits it grants and the legal agreements people engage in. Those are the names I want to change.\n \n \nHow can you say it protects my religious definition of marriage when it in fact changes it?\n\n \n Because your religion is not founded on our laws, and changing our laws to protect everyone equally will not change your religion in any fashion. You will still be able to engage in your relationships as you please, and I will be able to do the same. We'll both have the same legal rights under the law.\n \n Changing the law does not change your religion, unless you have a very different religion than I suspect. Indeed, my method would protect both of our religions; we'd both have access to the same rights and institutions under the law.\n \n \nIf that were true, then a person of any age could get social security.\n\n \n Not at all. Although our law creates certain benefits for elderly people alone, it does not create the same set of benefits for young people under a different name. If it did that, then it would be creating two different institutions which do the same thing for no reason other than recognizing the difference between \"young\" and \"old\", drawing a cutoffline, telling people they either belong to one group or the other. There is no reason for that.\n \n \nThat's because in the view of most of society, there's no such thing as same-sex marriage. It's an oxymoron. Marriage is a opposite-sex matter.\n\n \n Yet our law must be impartial. It must not bend to the majority's will when the majority's will is to treat the minority worse. I do consider \"marriage\" to be between same-sex or opposite-sex couples. But if \"marriage\" is an inappropriate term, then let's use a different one. It is simple enough.\n \n \nWhy would you want to have an opposite-sex 'institution' or criteria when you aren't opposite-sex? It seems to me that from a cultural standpoint it would be like a black person wanting to be called white in order to get civil rights.\n\n \n Same-sex couples don't want an opposite-sex institution! They think the law should not be creating opposite-sex institutions in the first place. They want our legal institutions to apply to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples.\n \n \nOf course I don't approve--I've made that clear many times here, and still do unapologetically. But you still deserve the benefits you need as couples since those benefits are already given to others (it would be inequality otherwise). But you don't deserve to change the definition of marriage which goes beyond gay people.\n\n \n Our legal rights should never go beyond gay people, and if marriage \"goes beyond gay people\", then marriage should not be in our laws. I can think of no logical reason otherwise, and I still do not understand why you would suggest that such an institution should be in our laws.\n \n \nThat's because it's not really segregation--you'd both be drinking from the same waterfountain . . . er, benefits. It's really defending marriage from redefinition.\n\n \n Then let us use a different word.",
