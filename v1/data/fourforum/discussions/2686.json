If you mean to shrink all the atoms that make up the baseball, well, that's impossible physically since an atoms size is dependent on certain laws of physics\n \n if you mean you want to shed away matter (atoms) in order to shrink it, then there'd be a point where you couldn't call it a baseball anymore since you would be left with less that it takes to make a baseball, you might be able to have a \"nano\"baseball, made of a few molecules, but it wouldn't be the same as a macroscopic baseball at all\n \n and possession of matter is not necessary to exist, since light has no mass, therefore no matter, but it exists, space (vacuum) has no matter and no energy (depending on whom you ask) but it exists",

   "There's another way something could \"shrink\". Most of matter is consists of the empty space between atoms. If you squeezed your baseball so that the atoms got closer and closer, eventually you'ld end up with a tiny little black hole. That's a very weird type of matter that's so dense that it has a really large gravitational field, for its size. Its gravity is so strong that not even light can escape, and the laws of physics do really weird things.",

   "actually r refers to the distance between the 2 bodies. \n \n\n That's what I said, isn't it?\n (edit)\n I think I blinked and missed something the first time I read you post. Yes, r is the distance between the objects, or more exactly the distance between their centers of mass. However, the objects can't share space, so the smallest r can be is set by the size (radius if we're talking spheres) of the object. So shrinking the radius of a sphere allows you to shrink the r in the gravity equation.\n \n \nthe gravitational force between the 2 bodies increase as the distance between them gets closer. this still does not relate to density\n\n \n It's true that denisty isn't explicitly in the equation. However, as you shrink something, (making it denser) you decrease it's radius, which means you decrease r, and thus increase F.\n \n Think of it this way. The distance between my center of mass and the earth's is about 4000 miles. So r =4000 miles, and F is some value. Now squeeze the Earth so it's half its former radius. The only thing in the gravity equation that's changed is r, which is now 2000. That means that something standing on the surface now feels 4 times as much gravity, even though the earth's mass hasn't changed. Cut the radius in half again and we're up to 16 times the original force. Squeeze the earth enough and gravitational force will increase to the point where you get the black hole effect. The reason that denisty is an issue is that it's not just how much mass you have, it's how small a volume you've squeezed it into. Even a small amount of mass, if squeezed enough, could trap light.",
