None are innocent. However, God says that vengence belongs to him. Christians persecuting is wrong. Period. God never calls a christian to persecute. The apostles of Jesus all died living this out. The apostle Paul used to persecute the followers of Jesus until he met Jesus (after the crucifixion and ressurection).\n \n God did explain his purpose in the bible. Priests and monks etc are only supposed to assist us in understanding. You should not abandon your faculties of reason. God wants you to reason it out for yourself. Read the bible, seek guidance from someone you know who lives a life of mercy and care and love and who you know, knows what's in the bible. But the truth you receive will be, at its base, between you and God. I may know some things about the bible and about God and could potentially assist in some things, but I don't know you nor you me. You have no reason to trust me, and rightly so. \n \n The constructions of fairness you propose are indeed ludicrous. I do not do that. I am a christian precisely because of the process I described. People I knew who lived well, guided me. I don't trust priests, generally. I trust people who's lives are transparent and obviously lived well.\n \n Anyway, it sounds like I am preaching and that is not my intent.

   "But such suffering is due to human falibility, is God not able above that?\n\n Yes God is able. but is man willing to turn to God for the help He is ready to give? its like this, the way I see it there are natural laws in place. you reap the same kind you sow; to every action theres an equal opposite reaction; what goes up must come down, things like that. if you throw a ball in the air, and it comes back down, it is not because God is unjust and vengeful, but because the consequences of natural laws are simply being carried out. in theory, God has the power to stop the ball from falling and make and exception to his own rule (the ball remains suspended in air), but you dont see many people crying out to God to make their thrown ball stay up\n \n what does this have to do with suffering? basically, on a more impactful scale, almost any suffering can be linked to an 'evil' deed done in the past. the deed may have nothing to do with the person suffering, so it seems unfair, but as far as nature is concerned, fairness is not a factor, just actions and consequences\n \n (now I said *almost*. some disasters are just that: disasters that didnt really have a human trigger, but cause human suffering just as well. what can I say...)\n \n lastly, the term \"suffering\" is totally subjective to the person in the situation. there are some people well off and even rich that are more depressed and suicidal than people in poverty or under calamity. some people are actually happier with themselves after going through \"suffering\" than they were before. to us looking on from outside, it may seem like a Godless state of hell on earth, but to the person in the situation, their faith in God (the very God you charge for their suffering) may be 10 times stronger...",

   "E,F, Phunting\n I'm sorry this is a long post but please take the time to read it fully it makes my point well!\n \nWhere do you get this date from?\n\n Two lines of evidence for this dating;\n 1) world events.\n Matthew 24:1-44\n 24 Departing now, Jesus was on his way from the temple, but his disciples approached to show him the buildings of the temple. 2 In response he said to them: \"Do YOU not behold all these things? Truly I say to YOU, By no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down.\" 3 While he was sitting upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying:\n \n This is when the disciples ask him a three part question;\n \n \"Tell us, (1) When will these things be, (2) and what will be the sign of your presence (3) and of the conclusion of the system of things?\"\n \n Question number 2 is interesting according to his answer.\n \n 4 And in answer Jesus said to them: \"Look out that nobody misleads YOU; 5 for many will come on the basis of my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will mislead many.\n \n There are more Christian religions today than ever before!!! \n \n 6 YOU are going to hear of wars and reports of wars; see that YOU are not terrified. For these things must take place, but the end is not yet.\n \n We live in the most war-torn generation ever to exist on earth at any time!!!\n \n 7 \"For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,\n \n Global warfare! In 1914 with the outbreak of the 1st world war came the fulfillment of this prophecy!!!\n \n and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another. 8 All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress.\n \n So the end did not immediately follow the 1st world war, True?\n \n 12 and because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will cool off. \n \n Does this match our time?\n \n 14 And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.\n \n I wonder, who does this today??????? Hum!!!!\n \n Truly I say to you this generation will by no means pass away until all things occur.\n \n So whoever see the 1st world war will also see the great tribulation and Armageddon. \n \n At the time of Christ' resurrection he \"sat down at the right hand of God, from then on awaiting until his enemies should be placed as a stool for his feet.\" (Heb 10:12, 13; Lu 20:41-43) This prophecy was recorded at Psalm 110, stating Jehovah's command to his Son: \"Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.\" (Ps 110:2) These enemies of Jehovah are shown to be composed of \"nations,\" \"national groups,\" \"kings of the earth,\" and \"high officials.\" (Ps 2:1-9) At Revelation 19:11-21 the one called \"Faithful and True,\" \"The Word of God,\" and \"King of kings and Lord of lords\" is described as leading the armies of heaven against his enemies. So with this in mind it seems that Jesus' return or \"the sign of {his] presence\" was to be when the earth was in a terrible state. Like 1914.\n \n 2) Bible chronology.\n \nI see nothing in that, or the rest of it to indicate 1914.\n\n Neither do I! Just trying to get your attention. \n \n The chronological evidence from the Bible for the year 1914 is from a prophecy recorded in the book of Daniel. The prophecy I had in mind was Daniel 4. ish.\n \n In the Scriptures, trees at times represent those who are prominent and lofty \n This is clearly expressed in Eze 31:2-14 which you must read. Agreed???\n \n I found a Watchtower magazine from 1990, 10/15, pages 18-20 tell me what you think. (be polite)\n *** w90 10/15 18-20 Be Thankful-Jehovah's Messianic Kingdom Rules ***\n Gentile Times-How Long?\n 13 The typical kingdom of God (Israel) was overthrown by Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar in 607 B.C.E. By the seventh Jewish month, about the middle of October, the land lay desolate. (2 Kings 25:8, 9, 22, 25, 26) In proof that this happened by divine permission, Jehovah God gave Nebuchadnezzar a dream. It involved a tree that was chopped down and allowed to grow again after a period of \"seven times.\" The dream had an initial fulfillment when Nebuchadnezzar was restored to his throne after a temporary state of madness.-Daniel 4:10-17, 28-36.\n 14 However, the theme of Nebuchadnezzar's dream showed that its main fulfillment involved God's typical kingdom, which that Gentile king had been permitted to 'chop down.' The dream concluded with this statement of purpose: \"That people living may know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that to the one whom he wants to, he gives it and he sets up over it even the lowliest one of mankind.\"-Daniel 4:17.\n 15 Only one person came to be qualified in all respects to be called \"the lowliest one of mankind.\" The only-begotten Son of God proved himself to be such by willingly leaving his heavenly glory to be born as a human, as Jesus, who suffered the most humiliating and cruel death at Satan's hand. (Philippians 2:3, 5-11) After his resurrection back to heavenly glory, Jesus had to wait until the period of seven times of Gentile rule ended before being enthroned as the Messianic King over mankind.-Hebrews 10:12, 13.\n 16 But how did Jehovah's Witnesses come to understand the length of the seven times? The Bible reveals that \"a time and times and half a time,\" or three and a half times, equals 1,260 days. (Revelation 12:6, 14) Therefore, double that number, or seven times, would amount to 2,520 days. On the basis of the prophetic guide of \"a day for a year,\" the seven times would equal 2,520 years. (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6) By this calculation, the Gentile Times, which started in October 607 B.C.E., ended 2,520 years later in October 1914.\n 17 In October 1914, Jehovah God set his beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, on the throne in the heavenly Kingdom. At last, the Revelation vision of the Christian apostle John started to become a reality, and the announcement could be made: \"The kingdom of the world did become the kingdom of our Lord [Jehovah] and of his Christ, and he [Jehovah] will rule as king forever and ever.\" (Revelation 1:10; 4:1; 11:15) What glorious news this is and what reason for the greatest happiness on the part of all joint heirs and subjects of that Kingdom!-Revelation 11:17.\n 18 True, for most of mankind, there has not been much happiness on earth since 1914. But the woeful conditions on earth are proof that Satan's rule is about to end. How do we know this? The book of Revelation indicated that the establishment of God's Kingdom would result in a war in heaven. Satan and his demons were to be cast out of heaven and limited to the vicinity of our earth. After seeing this victory in a prophetic vision, John heard a loud voice say: \"Be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them! Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.\"-Revelation 12:1-12.\n 19 Worsening world conditions since 1914 are proof that John's vision has become a reality and that the end of all humans who refuse to submit to God's sovereignty is drawing perilously near. (Luke 21:10, 11, 25-32) How thrilling it is to be alive at this wonderful time when Jehovah God, the Almighty, will settle the great issue of his sovereignty over the earth! Then, earth will be transformed into a beautiful paradise, and righteous human survivors will be uplifted to perfection. Even the dead will be raised and given the opportunity to qualify for everlasting life.-Revelation 20:1-3, 12, 13; 21:3-5.\n A Modern Need for Adjustment\n 20 For 38 years prior to 1914, the Bible Students, as Jehovah's Witnesses were then called, pointed to that date as the year when the Gentile Times would end., like first-century servants of God, they also had some wrong expectations. For example, they expected that the full number of anointed Christians would be raised to heaven by October 1914. They also thought that the war that started in 1914 would lead directly on to the end of Satan's world.\n 21 In time, though, anointed Christians realized that there was much work for them to do on earth. Because of their persistence in public witnessing during World War I, they experienced vicious persecution from the political authorities, urged on by Christendom's clergy. (Psalm 2:1-6) The activity of true Christians was dealt a severe blow on June 21, 1918, when leading officials of the Watch Tower Society in the United States were sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment under false charges.\n 22 World War I came to a sudden end in November 1918. Then, on March 25, 1919, the officials of the Watch Tower Society were released from prison. They were later fully exonerated. An unexpected period of peace opened up for those faithful anointed Christians, similar to the opportunities that presented themselves to Christ's early disciples after they were empowered by holy spirit in 33 C.E.-Acts 2:17-21, 41.\n 23 Ever since 1919, faithful anointed Christians as a group have zealously obeyed the command involved in Jesus' words at Matthew 24:14: \"This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.\" As a result, nearly four million of Christ's \"other sheep\" have devoted their lives to serving Jehovah in unity with the anointed remnant. (John 10:16) Christendom, under the influence of its clergy, continues to reject the Kingdom message. Its preference for human political schemes and its persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses parallel the shocking treatment of Christ by the first-century inhabitants of Judea. Just as Jehovah executed his judgment upon Jerusalem, so he will do to antitypical unfaithful Jerusalem, namely, Christendom. And as the generation that heard Christ's judgment message lived to experience the destruction he foretold, so the present generation since 1914 \"will by no means pass away\" before the foretold \"great tribulation\" comes.-Matthew 24:21, 22, 34.\n 24 What must we do to survive the great tribulation and live on into God's new world? Regardless of wrong expectations any of us may have had, we must guard against falling asleep as to our Christian duties. (Habakkuk 2:3; 1 Thessalonians 5:1-6) Those able to recall events from 1914 are becoming ever fewer. Thus, we need to be alert; there is no time to lose. (Matthew 24:42) All who want to survive the end of Satan's wicked world must act now in a way that shows agreement with the inspired words: \"We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, . . . because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king.\"-Revelation 11:17.\n \n CALCULATING THE \"SEVEN TIMES\" in Daniels prophecy\n \"Seven times\" = 7 X 360 = 2,520 years\n A Biblical \"time,\" or year = 12 X 30 days = 360. (Rev. 11:2, 3; 12:6, 14)\n In the fulfillment of the \"seven times\" each day equals one year. (Ezek. 4:6; Num. 14:34)\n Early October, 607 B.C.E., to December 31, 607 B.C.E.= 1/4 year\n January 1, 606 B.C.E., to December 31, 1 B.C.E. = 606 years\n January 1, 1 C.E., to December 31, 1913 = 1,913 years\n January 1, 1914, to early October, 1914 = 3/4 year\n Total: 2,520 years\n After all that we now come back to revelation 12:7, that was the consequence of the handing of kingdom power to Jesus in heaven, Satan didn't like that very much so he fought against it. The year was 1914 when he was cast to the earth. \n Any views???\n \n \n \n \nNow we are back to our old ways of disagreeing. The JW's have been making predictions and the like for a long time, all of them wrong. \n\n As they will readily admit all the time. Do you think they are wrong on this occasion? \n \nCome now. Satan has been on earth for a very long time.\n\n Yes! but he always had access to heaven aswell until 1914.",

Are you E\u00b7li'jah?\" And he said: \"I am not.\" \"Are you The Prophet?\" And he answered: \"No!\" 22 Therefore they said to him: \"Who are you? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" 23 He said: \"I am a voice of someone crying out in the wilderness, 'MAKE the way of Jehovah straight,' just as Isaiah the prophet said.\" 24 Now those sent forth were from the Pharisees. 25 So they questioned him and said to him: \"Why, then, do you baptize if you yourself are not the Christ or E\u00b7li'jah or The Prophet?\" 26 John answered them, saying: \"I baptize in water. In the midst of YOU one is standing whom YOU do not know, 27 the one coming behind me, but the lace of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.\" 28 These things took place in Beth'a\u00b7ny across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.\n 29 The next day he beheld Jesus coming toward him, and he said: \"See, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world! 30 This is the one about whom I said, Behind me there comes a man who has advanced in front of me, because he existed before me. 31 Even I did not know him, but the reason why I came baptizing in water was that he might be made manifest to Israel.\" 32 John also bore witness, saying: \"I viewed the spirit coming down as a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him. 33 Even I did not know him, but the very One who sent me to baptize in water said to me, 'Whoever it is upon whom you see the spirit coming down and remaining, this is the one that baptizes in holy spirit.' 34 And I have seen [it], and I have borne witness that this one is the Son of God.\"\n 35 Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples, 36 and as he looked at Jesus walking he said: \"See, the Lamb of God!\" 37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 38 Then Jesus turned and, getting a view of them following, he said to them: \"What are YOU looking for?\" They said to him: \"Rabbi, (which means, when translated, Teacher,) where are you staying?\" 39 He said to them: \"Come, and YOU will see.\" Accordingly they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day; it was about the tenth hour. 40 Andrew the brother of Simon Peter was one of the two that heard what John said and followed [Jesus]. 41 First this one found his own brother, Simon, and said to him: \"We have found the Mes\u00b7si'ah\" (which means, when translated, Christ). 42 He led him to Jesus. When Jesus looked upon him he said: \"You are Simon the son of John; you will be called Ce'phas\" (which is translated Peter).\n 43 The next day he desired to depart for Gal'i\u00b7lee. So Jesus found Philip and said to him: \"Be my follower.\" 44 Now Philip was from Beth\u00b7sa'i\u00b7da, from the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip found Na\u00b7than'a\u00b7el and said to him: \"We have found the one of whom Moses, in the Law, and the Prophets wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Naz'a\u00b7reth.\" 46 But Na\u00b7than'a\u00b7el said to him: \"Can anything good come out of Naz'a\u00b7reth?\" Philip said to him: \"Come and see.\" 47 Jesus saw Na\u00b7than'a\u00b7el coming toward him and said about him: \"See, an Israelite for a certainty, in whom there is no deceit.\" 48 Na\u00b7than'a\u00b7el said to him: \"How does it come that you know me?\" Jesus in answer said to him: \"Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.\" 49 Na\u00b7than'a\u00b7el answered him: \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel.\" 50 Jesus in answer said to him: \"Because I told you I saw you underneath the fig tree do you believe? You will see things greater than these.\" 51 He further said to him: \"Most truly I say to YOU men, YOU will see heaven opened up and the angels of God ascending and descending to the Son of man.\"",
