   " A Texas legislator is waging a war of biblical proportions against the science and education communities in the Lone Star State as he fights for a bill that would allow a private school that teaches creationism to grant a Master of Science degree in the subject.\n \n State Rep. Leo Berman (R-Tyler) proposed House Bill 2800 when he learned that The Institute for Creation Research (ICR), a private institution that specializes in the education and research of biblical creationism, was not able to receive a certificate of authority from Texas' Higher Education Coordinating Board to grant Master of Science degrees.\n \n Berman's bill would allow private, non-profit educational institutions to be exempt from the board's authority.\n \n \"If you don't take any federal funds, if you don't take any state funds, you can do a lot more than some business that does take state funding or federal funding,\" Berman says. \"Why should you be regulated if you don't take any state or federal funding?\"\n \n HB 2800 does not specifically name ICR; it would allow any institution that meets its criteria to be exempt from the board's authority. But Berman says ICR was the inspiration for the bill because he feels creationism is as scientific as evolution and should be granted equal weight in the educational community.\n \n \"I don't believe I came from a salamander that crawled out of a swamp millions of years ago,\" Berman told FOXNews.com. \"I do believe in creationism. I do believe there are gaps in evolution.\n \n \"But when you ask someone who believes in evolution, if you ask one of the elitists who believes in evolution about the gaps, they'll tell you that the debate is over, that there is no debate, evolution is the thing, it's the only way to go.\"\n \n But critics say that Berman's bill will be disastrous if it passes.\n \n \"This would open the door to other fly-by-night organizations that come in and want to award degrees in our state, because the bill is highly generalized,\" said Steven Schafersman, president of Texas Citizens for Science.\n \n \"Right now, we don't have this problem in Texas. Texas is not a center for degree mills, because our laws allow only the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to approve the granting of graduate degrees.\"\n \n \"It would certainly open the door to all kinds of chicanery,\" says Eugenie Scott, Executive Director of the National Center for Science Education. \"I mean, all you have to do, it looks to me from the bill, is start a non-profit organization, don't take any federal or state money, and then offer degrees in any fool subject you want.\"\n \n Schafersman fears that amending state law to accommodate institutions such as ICR would devalue Texas graduate degrees.\n \n \"The degrees would substandard, worthless, but they would be certified by Texas,\" he said.\n \n All colleges and universities granting degrees in Texas currently must be issued a certificate of authority by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB). The certificate allows that institution to grant a higher education degree that is recognized by the state - a degree a graduate would need to apply for a teaching position in a Texas public school.\n \n ICR was denied a certificate of authority in 2007.\n \n HB 2800 would pave the way for institutions like ICR to grant science degrees equal to those of other Texas universities. And that possibility has critics fuming.FOXNews.com - Bill Would Allow Texas School to Grant Master's Degree in Science for Creationism - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News\n \n emoticon_frazzled\n What's next? Witch doctors getting the right to declare they have a \"medical\" degree?\n These people CANNOT legitimize themselves in the SCIENTIFIC world, so they try to backdoor the issue in the POLITICAL world.",

   "Sounds right to me. What's the problem? emoticon_xangel\nNot a problem at all. That would legitimize the university that I founded, By Bayou U. (By Bayou U. is by the bayou. However, since it is in Houston, you might think that Buffalo Bayou is the bayou that By Bayour U is by. You would be wrong. White Oak bayou is the bayou that By Bayou U is by.) That would mean that anyone who was granted a degree from BBU could get a teaching certificate in Texas. As it is now, at least 3 BBU doctoral graduates that I know of are engaged in teaching at the university level, another is a research scientist with NASAs JPL, and several are teaching at the high school level. BBU granted degrees in such fields as Creation Science Education, Creation Science Theory (specializing in Cranial-Rectal Inversology), Modern Paleontology, Symphonic Flatulence, etc.\n \n I mean! If you think that offering Master's degrees so that creationists can continue to dumb down our children would bother a Texan, you are mistaken. Just think! We Texans twice elected George W. Bush Governor, and then overwhelmingly voted for him in two Presidential elections.\n \n The best part is that to earn the degree all that is necessary is to be able to listen to the teacher repeat \"Goddidit\" again, and again for an hour for each class. After a year of doing this for 3 or 4 hours each day, you get a degree.\n \n And teaching it is even better! No class preparation, no lecture notes, no research, no need to keep current in the field, no intelligence required. All you have to do is to point out that Goddidit. When there are questions, the answer is always, Goddidit. Exams are easy to correct because every answer is Goddidit.\n \n In Texas, creation science can pass for science.",

   "So you don't have a problem with turning real graduate degrees into degrees on par with diploma mills?\nI certainly don't. That's the whole purpose of By Bayou U. It is a diploma mill that stands with the best of the creationist mills. That is the purpose of this bill. It grants the status of legitimacy to diploma mills just because they are religiously motivated. It also would allow me to grant degrees (as I have been doing for several years - complete with diplomas) and be recognized in Texas, even though I have no religious motivation whatsoever. How nifty. I can make some real money if this bill passes. I'll just have to charge less and require less actual work than the other diploma mills, and I'll be in fat city.\n \n I wonder why it is that John Morris, the son of the founder of ICR, Henry Morris, does not have a degree from ICR. He actually earned a Bachelor's degree, a Master's degree, and a PhD (geological engineering) from real universities while his father pretended to to grant degrees in flood geology from ICR.\n \n Oh well. I'll grant a degree in flood geology to anyone who can say \"goddidit\" three times really fast. I know! My requirements are a bit more strict than the ICR, but I do have some standards.",
