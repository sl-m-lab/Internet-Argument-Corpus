   "Uzbekistan Interior Minister Zakirjon Almatov is currently on an extended visit to Germany where he is receiving medical treatment at a clinic in Hanover. Actually, Zakirjon Almatov is known as \"The Butcher of Andijan\", a man who showed little humanity as he told protesters there would be no negotiations and ordered government troops start firing into the crowd. Since Almatov is now in Europe, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International Deutschland addressed German chief public prosecutor Kay Nehm with a demand to take in charge the Uzbek oppressor. \n \n All the same, HRW and AI should seize the occasion of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's tour of Europe and make her face legislation all the way as she is currently the only White House representative now in Europe and she is certainly the one responsible for CIA secret jails in Europe where alleged terrorists are kept being abused and tortured. Besides, when Rice was in Germany on visit, Germany's oppositional parties were demanding an investigation into claims that more 400 CIA flights used German airspace - the suspicion is that some may have been used to transport terrorist suspects to secret prisons for interrogation. \n \n I think it is a sound moment to make Condoleezza Rice stand trial and let people know at last where CIA secret jails are located. Don't waste you time, Amnesty International!\n \n http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41088000/jpg/_41088234_rice_ap203bo.jpg",

But this bot calls for Condi to \"stand trial\"? For what, we have yet to put forth any evidence actually showing that this is true anyway?",
