   "Bishop Eddie Long Scandal [VIDEO] Gay Sex Lawsuit- See Everything in Actual Lawsuit - Associated Content - associatedcontent.com\n \n On one hand, it could very well be the pastor actually leans gay.\n On the other hand, there are a lot of people out to get anyone who takes a public stand against normalizing homosexual relationships, and it may be another case of public character assassination. Maybe it's a combination.\n \n The thing is, neither possibility bodes well for the gay pride movement. If he IS gay, then that only means he's all the MORE qualified to speak to the gay experience and therefore it adds weight to his statements that homosexuality is wrong. \n \n If he didn't do the things he's being accused of, then that means he's being victimized by people spreading lies.\n \n I think there's enough hatred toward religion out there that anytime something like this happens, many anti-theists automatically assume guilt period, even without all the facts. People need to reserve judgment until there are facts on the table.",

If people who struggle with homosexuality are more homophobic, why should we not also assume they are doing so because they feel they are closer to the issue and therefore know it better?\n\n \n I think your logic is faulty, as you are missing the operative word here, \"struggling\".\n \n You say \"If people who struggle with homosexuality are more homophobic ...\", we are referring to homosexuals who struggle with homosexuality. (Though it could be extended to anyone.)\n \n If they are more homophobic, a reasonable question to ascertain why that is, would be, \"how do they compare to a control group?\" Like homosexuals who do not struggle with homosexuality. I think you would have to agree that it would seem homosexuals who are comfortable with their sexuality are, on the whole, less homophobic than those strugglers you refer to.\n \n It would seem it is the the struggling, not the homosexuality, that is correlated with homophobia.\n \n Your idea that a \"closeness\" to the issue is a cause of homophobia makes no sense and does not stand up to facts. It seems intuitive and has been established that a familiarity with homosexuals and homosexuality is strongly correlated with less discomfort with homosexuality.\n \n Therefore, Accipter's contention that \"Homophobia can be a result of repressed homosexuality\" makes much more sense than your idea.",
