   "I said if people want to continue the discussion, I'd respond in the religion forum instead as it was getting off-topic in the Creation/Evolution forum. Since a couple of people DID respond, I take it they want to continue. Here's the link to the original discussion: http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=11082&page=4\n \n \nNow you're getting it.\n\n \n I think that's a pretty over-simplified answer. Of course I'm getting it--like I said, I understand your argument; it's not anything new, with all due respect. But I think what I said is more reason you're wrong than that you're right.\n \n \nIndeed, that is just what that idea means. So you have basically two choices here - either they made up a god that doesn't let them eat bacon and wipes them out if they don't believe in him for too long, or their IS a god (the god of all Christians) that IS like that.\n\n \n That doesn't address though if they intended to make it up with those seemingly negative qualities. There's a difference in saying they 'made up' such a god, and intended it to be undetectable. My point is about motivations and intent. I don't think they SET OUT to make it undetectable at all. Of course, I believe the Judeo-Christian God isn't really made up to begin with; but I don't mind arguing from the standpoint of devil's advocate, because in my experience skeptics aren't open to arguing about it any other way.\n \n \nAs to your question on why not make up a more friendly god, isn't it obvious? Making up the cranky, despotic God of the Bible gives the intercessors between said God and the people a HUGE amount of power over the people (who fear said God and will follow most anything that is told them that the God commands as they KNOW that if they don't believe in him too long they will get wiped out).\n\n \n Ah yes, the conspiracy-theory-view of how monotheistic religion started. That speculation isn't 'dismissable' with Hebrew religion, but the speculation is not so easy with the beginnings of Christianity--it's a religion harder to believe people would start up at the risk of they and their families being put at risk under Roman persecution. It was dangerous to start up religions at that time, and to start one up to just control people and have power over them when the Roman empire really had the power, particularly with the dangers involved, seems much less likely.",

You said,\n \n \n Your idea means that they also would have made up a god that supposedly wipes them out if they don't believe in him for too long, or punishes them for things like eating bacon.

Obviously every single aspect of a religion won't be about control. A religion that is all \"stick\" will lose all its followers. Some of it has to be \"carrot\", some commone sense, some basic morality, and a dash of folk lore doesn't hurt. Circumcision, for example, serves several of these purposes.

   "In order to believe as these nay sayers do, they must believe that everyone who has ever accepted Jesus and has believed in a personal God must have been susceptible to brainwashing, coercion, manipulation, fear based control and brain washing. \n\n Freudian slip much? emoticon_xbye \n \n \nIn other words, ignorant followers who are so weak intellectually that they can be turned into mind numbed minions with no real assurance of anything at all in the life to come.\n\n That describes many of the nutso radical christians I have met.\n \n \n\n I'm here to tell you that my relationship with God came from within me; not from any person who told me what I must believe in order to be saved after I die someday. I was born again on August 16, 1975 at age 22. My salvation experience was real and personal and you have no idea how hard it was to tell my parents that I was now saved but knew so little about the bible that i couldn't define or explain what had actually happened to me apart from the fact that I knew the Holy Spirit of God indwelled me and that i was a new creature in Christ. \n Dude, I think we've all heard your story. First it started with you almost getting mugged (while interestingly walking around a bad neighborhood at like 2 AM - hmmmmm wonder what you wer doin' around there at that time......) and your muggers saw some bogeyman. Then years later you \"came\" into \"the faith\", you realised it was one of your Majjikk Angels that scared them mean muggers away from you.\n \n We've also heard your stories about how you think you were some sort of wild, lady-pleasing sex machine, and how good looking you are (ego much).\n \n Do you really think we care all that much?\n \n \n\n I was literally what the bible called a spiritual babe in Christ with no head knowledge at all of how to even be a Christian, and yet I knew I was a new creature. So you guys can intellectualize about how we believers have been coerced through fear or just manipulated through power brokers but the only person I gave my life and allegiance to that day was my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, not any Pastor or Church.\n\n \n As they say, to promise them heaven, ya gotta threaten em with hell. And that's how any other mob, etc. gets their work done, and that's how Christianity works, because let's face it - most followers will kinda wonder what is so wonderful about heaven and why they have to believe in some Zombie dude to get there if they haven't been put in fear of hell.",

Host: Who exactly was Mohammed? Was he a prophet? (5:00)\n Answer\n References\n Dr. Labib: Mohammed was not a true prophet. And I say that because, you see, the true prophet must receive a direct call from God, especially if he will be the founder of a religion. Mohammed is the founder of Islam. Moses received a direct call from God. Mohammed didn't receive a direct call from God. The story is very interesting. He was in the cave of Hira, outside of Mecca, and there, a spirit appeared to Mohammed. And then, the spirit squeezed Mohammed very tightly, that he thought that he was going to die. And the spirit said to Mohammed, \"Read.\" Mohammed was illiterate, he could not read. And he said, \"I cannot read.\" Then the spirit squeezed him more tightly that he thought he was going to die. And the spirit said to him, \"Read!\" \"I cannot read,\" Mohammed answered. Then the spirit squeezed him more tightly. He was afraid that he was going to die. And he said, \"Read!\" He said, \"What shall I read?\" The words should be recited because he could not read. How could you command someone who doesn't know how to read, read? You say to him, \"Recite!\" And then he said, \"What shall I read?\" And he said, \"Read, in the name of thy Lord, who created man from the clot,\" etc, etc. So the Quran is not the invention of Mohammed. The Quran was given to him by that spirit who appeared to him at the cave of Hira. The Muslims say, that the spirit was Gabriel the angel. They say the angel Gabriel is the spirit who appeared to Mohammed at the cave of Hira , and he squeezed him tightly.\n \n But listen, when you go the Bible, Gabriel appeared to many people. Gabriel appeared to Daniel, and Daniel was scared. And he said, \"Do not be afraid, Daniel.\" Then he appeared Zecharia, the father of John the Baptist. And he was afraid, and Gabriel said, \"Do not be afraid, do not be afraid.\" Then he appeared to Mary. And Mary was troubled, and Gabriel said, \"Do not be afraid.\" But that spirit who met Mohammed and squeezed him, left him very troubled. He was scared to death. And when he went back to his wife Khadigah, he said, \"I am scared, I am scared! I am trembling?\" She said, \"What?\" He said, \"I don't know, I don't know. I am afraid that I am possessed.\" Then she took him to a bishop in Mecca, by the name of Waraka Bin Nawfal, who was her cousin, and she told him about what happened. And this Waraka, the bishop of the Amunit cult in Mecca said to her, \"Oh, be quiet. Be quiet. Mohammed will be the prophet of the Arabs.\"\n Although Moslems tell us Gabriel appeared to him, the Angel himself never referred to himself as Gabriel. It is believed that the Angel that appeared to mohammed was a fallen angel who brought to him a false religion in order to place the masses who would follow it into bondage to rules, customs and regulations. That's why islam has such violent responses to those who break the rules. \n \n And tell me what assurances one has in islam that they are saved TODAY! You can't; because it offers no assurance or specific way to be saved at all. Islam is loyal to mohammed more so than to allah, its perceived god who was originally the moon god allah.The best a moslem has is the hope that allah will accept them after death. But the process is totally subjective and no route to salvation is assured at all in this cult that holds people in bondage to rules and traditions with no freedom of independence from religious bondage at all.\n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu81Z8fBHuIABr4ZXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTBybnZlZnRlBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMQRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAw--/SIG=120dcdmbi/EXP=1207059161/**http%3a//www.biblebelievers.org.au/moongod.htm\n \n cult |k&#601;lt|\n noun\n a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object : \n  \n",

Jesus wasn't just a man or just a prophet; He, by His own claims is God incarnate (in the flesh). Also, Jesus requires that we DO NOTHING AT ALL IN ORDER TO BE SAVED, because HE did all the work on the Cross by dying for our sins. Salvation is a free gift of God that pays the price for our sins rather than requiring, as islam does that we serve a belief system under threat of torture and death for disobeying its prophet. \n \n Mohammed threatened to bow to allah or die.

So you can have no objection in principle to atheists believing the same of all religions, hmm?\n\n \n Study how mohammed grew islam Peeling; because you're showing you don't know the history at all. Islam never grew by people willingly accepting and receiving its gospel of salvation because it offers no freedom or liberty at all. Mohammed grew islam by first invading small tribes and villages with his small band of warriors. He killed the leaders and alpha males immediately and then offered the women, children and surviving men the opportunity to accept and serve allah or to also die. \n \n As the religion grew through invasion, so did larger towns and Cities fall under the sword of Mohammed's army. So it wasn't brainwashing at all that led to islams growth; it was violence and coercion under threat of death with constant and persistent brutality that held people into the generational bondage to this violent cult. And what saddens me to the core is that allegedly intelligent people like you can't recognize that reality in spite of a well documented history and a first hand view of the oppression it currently imposes on its World wide community as well as the threats and intimidation it is imposing on any Country that rejects its oppressive beliefs through modern day TERRORISM.",

Different words, same sentiment.\n Quote:\n\n \n Ahh, there in lies the true difference in the two beliefs systems, and distinguishes one as a personal relationship with the living God while exposing the other as a true cult which is based upon, and built on violence.\n \n Just ask yourself if the church you went to as a young child has chased you down with threats of physical violence for not attending anymore? And are you afraid of any christian church arresting you, trying you as an infidel and executing you if you choose to become a moslem? I think not. But any moslem living in most islamic Countries today would surely fear being put to death for choosing to become a believer in and follower of Christ.\n \n So you see Peeling; where as islam will hold all moslems into physical and religious bondage in THIS LIFE, Jesus offers eternal life, but only according to the exercise of ones absolute free will. No coercion will ever be applied in order to force anyone to receive Jesus as Savior. It is made clear though that as free agents we will be held responsible for our lifes choices. But that is the ultimate show of respect by God.\n \n He is telling us that He loves us so much that He personally took on life; lived as a perfect example for us and then sacrificed Himself as only He was worthy and able to as He died for our sins, once for all people, and for all time. That is perfect love. Yet even then He wont insist that we receive His free gift but respects us enough to allow us to choose to spend eternity with Him. If we choose otherwise, He will also respect that choice when the time comes no matter how painful it will be for Him to lose those who rejected the love He so freely offered them. \n \n I mean, if God didn't love humanity so much then He wouldn't have taken on life as Jesus Christ and died for us in the first place. So don't blame him when it's you rejecting His free gift. It isn't Him rejecting you at all, but neither will He force you into submitting to Him because that goes against His desire for a relationship that's based on love rather than coercion through fear.",

Or Hell?\n \n Ghandi did a lot of good in his life.\n He doesn't believe in the Christian god.\n Heaven? Or Hell?\n\n \n [Shrug] A lot of people have done bad things--very bad things--and realised they were wrong in the end and felt very sorry for it. Of course you used two very extreme examples from opposite ends of the spectrum, but if Hitler had genuinely been repentant and realised he was wrong in what he did, why should forgiveness (at SOME point) not be extended to him? Is there some line where people cross where they become 'unforgiveable'? One of the important points of Christianity is that it's one of the few (if THE only) mainline systems where someone who has truly committed atrocities can be forgiven with real penitence. The idea that either of these men could go to heaven doesn't bother me in the least. And if they are in hell, then ... well, so be it. These guys are dead now. As far as the question of who makes it--only God can say for certain with a lot of people. I have no interest in going around trying to attribute whether someone is going to heaven or hell. If you don't want to follow Christian teaching, don't follow it. No one is making you. If you're confident that you're a.) either going to heaven, or b.) there is no afterlife, then good for you. It's your business and your life. You've heard the Christian message, and I'm certainly not going to beat you over the head with it. If you're truly confident in it, then what are you worried about?\n \n \nAs a society, we have evolved past a blind assumption of \"evil\" when it comes to other people's beliefs.\n\n \n I'm not so sure we have. Besides, IMO there are some areas that Christianity is MORE 'evolved' than much of society--such as the above example of being willing to forgive people like Hitler at SOME point, when they've realised the awfulness of what they did. A lot of society would probably not let someone like Hitler go to heaven, and be glad they were in hell. With Christianity, someone who has done the worst of the worst could find peace. This is the same reason (IMO) a lot of ex-convicts in prison become Christians.\n \n \nBut it is an arguable assessment that god sees other religions as \"evil\". An assessment that society typically does not share.\n\n \n So? Again, you're free to believe (or not believe) what you want.",

   "[Shrug] A lot of people have done bad things--very bad things--and realised they were wrong in the end and felt very sorry for it. Of course you used two very extreme examples from opposite ends of the spectrum, but if Hitler had genuinely been repentant and realised he was wrong in what he did, why should forgiveness (at SOME point) not be extended to him? Is there some line where people cross where they become 'unforgiveable'? One of the important points of Christianity is that it's one of the few (if THE only) mainline systems where someone who has truly committed atrocities can be forgiven with real penitence. The idea that either of these men could go to heaven doesn't bother me in the least.\n\n Yet in our societies, we do not have such a standard.\n Regret can work towards limiting a sentence, but not towards eliminating it.\n \n One of the things that is interesting about this is how the system insists on the penalty being paid only AFTER confirmation is made.\n The list of people who would still not \"follow\" the Christian faith if they actually \"knew\" it to be accurate would be concievably small.\n \n So if belief is confirmed, it's too late to \"forgive\" anything.\n But if it's still at the \"belief\" stage, ANYTHING can be confirmed.\n \n \n \nIf you don't want to follow Christian teaching, don't follow it. No one is making you. If you're confident that you're a.) either going to heaven, or b.) there is no afterlife, then good for you. It's your business and your life. You've heard the Christian message, and I'm certainly not going to beat you over the head with it. If you're truly confident in it, then what are you worried about?\n\n This discussion has nothing to do with \"worry\".\n It's about an objective analysis of the rationality of the Christian dogma approach.\n \n \n \nI'm not so sure we have. Besides, IMO there are some areas that Christianity is MORE 'evolved' than much of society--such as the above example of being willing to forgive people like Hitler at SOME point, when they've realised the awfulness of what they did.\n\n 1) With regards to \"not so sure we have\", my first thought was on Bill Maher's rabid character assassination of religion.\n I would guess he would be a prime example of those who haven't evolved...\n \n 2) There is a flip side of that whereby \"forgiveness\" may be unwarranted.\n The bible tells people to \"turn the other cheek\", and makes no mention of requiring the person to whom the cheek is given to have regret.\n I would consider it more \"evolved\" to be wary and practice self-defense.",

   "He chose to create such a system because he wanted to give people freedom of choice and free will--we aren't robots. Look, what you seem to mainly have a problem with is the idea of atonement--that there's a need for it. Clearly, there is evil in the world. I can understand that from an atheist POV which doesn't believe in God, you in turn wouldn't believe that atonement is needed for people. But that difference ultimately boils down to belief in God vs. no belief in God (since most religions include SOME form of atonement teaching), and on that we're never going to agree. It's a disagreement that's on too fundamental of a level.\n\n It's actually a disagreement on two levels. First, I disagree with the idea of eternal punishment. It cannot help but be disproportionate to the crime, and seems particularly pointless when the good people are living it up in heaven anyway. What's it for? What does it accomplish? Hence my conclusion that it can only be intended as coercion, as a threat.\n \n Secondly, one need not be evil to end up in hell. It is sufficient to be raised in a different religion and for the evangelists of Christianity to fail in their mission. That sucks, frankly, especially given the calibre of many evangelists.",

   "As I posted above; hell was created for the devil and his angels, NOT HUMANITY.\n\n Which is why I was careful to say 'hell as a potential destination for uncooperative souls', not merely 'hell'. Hell could exist without any humans ever ending up there, yes? But Hell the retirement village has a purpose, and that purpose is to threaten and coerce.\n \nBut sin separates man from God. And it's a separation that only God could breech so He did all of the work needed to break down that wall.\n\n What; he cannot simply forgive our sins, he was obliged to jump through uncomfortable hoops to do it? Who can oblige god to do something? If he didn't make the rule that forced him to jump through those hoops, who did? And if he did make that rule, why?\n \nHe offered all of us the free gift of eternal forgiveness and salvation that only He could offer. A pardon if you will that delivers us from the well deserved punishment of eternity in hell.\n\n Well deserved? For living a quiet, moral life but not being convinced by Christian evangelists? An eternity of torture? I can't think of anyone I'd condemn to such a fate, let alone some harmless old Hindu or polite and humane atheist.\n \nNow it's up to us to receive that pardon. If we don't receive it then we have nobody at all to blame than ourselves.\n\n And nobody but god to blame for the consequences. Whether we have a choice is irrelevant. The question is whether coercion is involved, something you deny. But you aren't describing a free choice. 'Tea or coffee?' is a free choice. 'Tea or being roasted on a spit over Satan's arsehole for all eternity' is not.\n \nLook at it this way; if the President offers a criminal a Presidential Pardon which allows that person to be released from Federal Prison immediately, and the crime he was convicted of was to be erased from his record forever, which is what a pardon does; and the criminal refused the pardon and responded to it by insulting the presidents politics and prison system, will you then condemn the Presidents system for pardoning prisoners, or our legal system which originally convicted the criminal? Or would you rightly call the prisoner a complete and utter XXXXX for rejecting such a gracious and kind offer from the president who was under no such compulsion to make such an offer since the criminal was indeed guilty of the crime he was convicted of?\n\n Why would I look at it that way when it's completely unrepresentative?\n \n Let's look at it this way: I'm sitting at home minding my own business when I get a few dozen near-identical letters through the door, each one claiming to be from a different president, and all saying that some random and inoccuous behaviour of mine is in fact a mortal sin and that unless I commit myself unreservedly to apologising for that behaviour I will burn in hell for all eternity. Oh, and they're all mutually exclusive, so if I pick the wrong apology to make, I'll burn in hell for all eternity. None of these letters can provide any evidence they're authentic, and most of what they do say that can be tested against reality is flatly contradicted.\n \n Personally, I trash the lot along with the Betterware catalogue and the invitation to apply for a new Barclaycard.\n \n But ok, fine, let's try your version, with a smaller concession to reality. The president offers me a conditional pardon - conditional upon me getting down on my knees and declaring my undying love for him. Indeed, my only crime has been not falling on my knees before him already. If I do it I can go free. If I don't, I get to rot in jail forever. Now, I may be a XXXXX if I don't take him up on his offer, but that still doesn't mean there's no coercion involved. If a dictator demands you worship him and threatens you with torture if you refuse, does it fail to qualify as coercion just because worshipping him isn't difficult? If the Mob comes to your house and threatens your family, you would rightly be deemed a XXXXX for telling them where to get off. Does that mean they aren't coercing you?",
