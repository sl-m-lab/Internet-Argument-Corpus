   "The Holy Eucharist is the oldest experience of Christian Worship as well as the most distinctive. Eucharist comes from the Greek word which means thanksgiving. In a particular sense, the word describes the most important form of the Church's attitude toward all of life. The origin of the Eucharist is traced to the Last Supper at which Christ instructed His disciples to offer bread and wine in His memory. The Eucharist is the most distinctive event of Orthodox worship because in it the Church gathers to remember and celebrate the Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ and, thereby, to participate in the mystery of \n http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article7077.asp\n \n The Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist is to be found in the Bible...\n St Mat 26\n 26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, \"Take and eat; this is my body.\" \n 27 Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, \"Drink from it, all of you. 28 This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 29 I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom.\" \n 30 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\n \n St Matt. 26:26; St Mark. 14:22; St Luke 22:19-20 - the Greek phrase is \"Touto estin to soma mou.\" This phraseology means \"this is actually\" or \"this is really\" my body and blood.\n \n 1 Cor. 11:24 - the same translation is used by Paul - \"touto mou estin to soma.\" The statement is \"this is really\" my body and blood. Nowhere in Scripture does God ever declare something without making it so.\n \n 1 Cor 11 is interesting for it surely puts to rest that the event depicted above in the three Synaptic Gospels is not merely a combative meal. St. Paul says in 1 Cor 11\n 17 In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. 18 In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. 19 No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. 20 When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, 21 for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. 22 Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! \n 23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" 25 In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" 26 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. \n 27 Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. 28 A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. 29 For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. 30 That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. 31 But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. 32 When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. \n 33 So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. 34 If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. \n And when I come I will give further directions.\n \n This is a letter of instruction which is saying if it's food you're after, stay at home, for the Eucharist is not a 'meal' of food. The key is in verse 29 where he rebukes any who eats or drinks at the Eucharist without acknowledging that it is the very body and blood of Christ.\n \n There is evidence from outside the Bible as well. When pagans heard that Christians were eating and drinking of the Body of Christ, they believed that the Christians were cannibals. They were of course mistaken, but their accounts go to show that the early church were partaking of the Eucharist; not a communal celebratory meal\n \"Christian beliefs and practices were misunderstood, with rumours spreading that they were cannibalistic ('Take and eat; this is my body broken for you' = Eucharist),\"\n http://www.libertymagazine.org/arti...eview/214/1/34/\n \n Thus the commemorative* (written after 50 AD but before 120AD; and again, well before some of the books of the Bible were written) states...\n 9:1 But as touching the Eucharistic thanksgiving give ye thanks thus.\n 9:2 First, as regards the cup:\n 9:3 We give Thee thanks, O our Father, for the holy vine of Thy son David, which Thou madest known unto us through Thy Son Jesus;\n 9:4 Thine is the glory for ever and ever.\n 9:5 Then as regards the broken bread:\n 9:6 We give Thee thanks, O our Father, for the life and knowledge which Thou didst make known unto us through Thy Son Jesus;\n 9:7 Thine is the glory for ever and ever.\n 9:8 As this broken bread was scattered upon the mountains and being gathered together became one, so may Thy Church be gathered together from the ends of the earth into Thy kingdom;\n 9:9 for Thine is the glory and the power through Jesus Christ for ever and ever.\n 9:10 But let no one eat or drink of this Eucharistic thanksgiving, but they that have been baptized into the name of the Lord;\n 9:11 for concerning this also the Lord hath said:\n 9:12 {Give not that which is holy to the dogs.}\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-lightfoot.html\n *The Didache was a short guide-book for the early church.",

   "Kronous,\n Three questions you've asked\n a) the Eucharist is in the Bible\n b) yes I am posting something here, that's what you've read and responded too. I'm amazed you don't know you're responding to a post. Sorry, just being a emoticon_xclown to amuse myself late this evening.\n c) no, not exactly\n In conversation with another poster (Terral), on the JW thread, he suggested that I start a thread on this topic, as he doesn't believe that the Eucharist is based on the Bible. There's a division in Christianity on how to interpret Matthew/Mark/Luke with regards to what is commonly called \"The Last Supper\"\n Is it\n a) a one off event\n b) a call for people to share in a communal meal to remember that night\n c) the institution of a sacrament by Jesus Christ.\n For the most part, most Christians believe 'c' is the answer... by which I mean most Catholics, Orthodox, Copts, and a sizeable amount of Anglicans et al.\n Oddly enough, this person believes in the Trinity, but, when arguing against the Biblical evidences for the Eucharist cries the fact that the word \"Eucharist\" appears but once. I say this is odd, because although he believes in the Trinity, the word \"Trinity\" doesn't appear at all in the Bible. Needless to say, both are biblical, because the 'concept' is there.\n He claims that the Eucharist is instead a man-made thing... created much later. He's oft repeated this so I provided evidence from the Bible, and from the writings of early church, and even anecdotal evidence from outside - from pagans.\n \n I should expect that this then is a subject that lies outside your own extensive knowledge on Christianity, Kronous. :)",

   "OK This is really bugging me....\n I have spent the last half hour reading the Canon law and liturgical laws on Holy communion..\n here is a clip\n A.According to the Code of Canon Law, \"Holy Communion is to be given under the form of bread and wine or under both kinds in accord with the norm of the liturgical laws or even under the form of wine, alone in case of necessity\" (Canon 925). The Second Vatican Council has encouraged the reception of Holy Communion under both forms. Yet since the Vatican Council, there have been various qualifications which limit the administration of the Eucharist under the form of both bread and wine. The reason for this restriction is the liability to abuse of the Blessed Sacrament where the whole congregation, at every Mass, would receive from the chalice. Not the least of these abuses is consecration of such an abundance of wine that a large quantity of the Precious Blood is left over after Mass. Sacrilegious disposition of the consecrated chalice is not uncommon in some places. As a result, the normal procedure is to restrict the reception of communion under both species only to special occasions, such as weddings or certain solemn feasts. Moreover, the priests may administer Holy Communion by intinction. Here they dip the consecrated Host into the chalice and say to the communicant, \"The Body and Blood of Christ.\"\n \n \n \n so if they can omit the wine, why cant they substitute the Wafer?",

The Last Supper was both the regular Passover meal, and Jesus farewelling His Apostles, and Jesus began at that time the Eucharist to be the 'new covenant'. As to being started 'well after', well the Didache gives a clue to an early point, but even more convincing does St. Paul's letter to the Corinthians where by he rebukes people in his own time who partake of the sacrament as a meal of commemoration. So I'd dispute the inference that it was long after. St.Paul's already talking about them dividing over how to partake of traditions, and some are already making the mistake of having a commemoration meal.\n \nAfter all, the last supper was a Passover celebration, and Christianity was still a Jewish sect for quite some time after Jesus died.\n\n I'd have to quibble again over your choice of words relating to time. Christians (of the Orthodox bent, at least) believe that the Eucharist was established at Passover to replace/fulfil it.\n \nI have no access to references at the moment, so I can't check this, but it seems reasonable to posit that the Eucharist didn't become its own tradition until after the Christians stopped considering themselves to be a Jewish sect, and thus stopped associating the last supper so closely with Passover.

However, this problem is resolved by Catholic doctrine which states that if you have the bread, or the wine, you're in fact having both...\n \"Given the need for total abstention from hosts containing gluten, the common advice given to Celiac-Sprue sufferers is to receive the Precious Blood alone. Priests are thus well advised to clearly teach the doctrine of concomitance, the Church's belief that under either species the whole Christ is received. Likewise, priests should recall the right which each Catholic in good standing has to receive Holy Communion (Canon 843). In the light of this right, the Precious Blood must be made available to sufferers of this disease who request it, even if it is not offered to the rest of the congregation.\"\n http://www.nccbuscc.org/liturgy/innews/042000.htm\n This doctrine is that 'like' types are the same. If you have the wine alone, you're still having the fullness of Christ.\n We Orthodox however tend to give both at once, the bread dipped in wine, so it is more problematic for Orthodox worshippers, than for Catholics... however (stated at a web-site above), the disease seems to be prevalent in northern Europeans, and there aren't as many Orthodox there. I'm not sure if the idea that the bread is to be made from wheat is a 'dogma' for Orthodoxy, it might well be. If it's not, that problem is then resolved as well. Being a non-expert, any searches I've done on 'substitutes' for Orthodox Eucharist bread are only in the range of 'wholemean' instead of 'white' bread etc., which is not an answer to this particular problem.\n I should add further to that, when we consume the Eucharist, it's not bread and wine anymore, but the Body and Blood of Christ.",

That's the best you can get... as neither of us are aware that the bread (NOT wafer!) used by Orthodox must be wheat - though as a guess I'd say 'yes'. But, as I said, it ceases to be bread and becomes the Body of Christ. I for one don't drink. I haven't drunk alcohol since 1986.** I don't count the 'wine' as wine as it's the Blood of Christ.\n To prove your point about the 'miracle of transubstantiation' you'd need to show where someone has got sick from such an action. Mere speculation that a person might well get sick is not evidence. The fact is that the person's probably already diagnosed as having the disease, and the parents not wishing to take a risk, ask the Catholic priest to give wine alone.

These are important things to us, we're even divided on the use of a single word 'filioque'... which Catholics use, but we don't.

When I read Chap. 11 Vs. 17-34, I'm not seeing anything about the rite of the Eucharist per se. Paul does refer to the last supper, but it seems to me to be more of a lesson then a ritual. In versus 17-19 Paul says he hears there has been squabling. 20-22 he's reminding them they're at worship, not at home. 23-26 he reminds them of the last supper. 27-32 he calls for introspection and restraint, and 33-34 he tells them to show some manners at the table.\n \n You probably know better than I, but these letters were written somewhere around 50-60 AD, yes? The Christians were persecuted, and meeting in people's homes. I believe, and will try to confirm if you disagree, that the custom was often to serve a meal at some point during the gathering. It sounds like some members of the Corinthian congregation were hogging the food or starting to eat before everyone got there, and Paul is telling them to slow down, show some restraint and dignity, and remember the sacrifice of Christ every time you sit to eat and drink bread and wine.\n \n The words that Paul uses are the words of the Holy Eucharist, but read in context I don't think he's talking about the Eucharist in the sense you mean at all. It sounds to me like he's saying that whenever you sit down to bread and wine, (sit down to a meal back then) you should remember the last supper and Jesus, and act accordingly.",

You threw this in for a bit of sensationalism, but it's not even that, as it's an attempt to make an issue of a non-issue.\n \nAbout 1 Cor. When I read Chap. 11 Vs. 17-34, I'm not seeing anything about the rite of the Eucharist per se. Paul does refer to the last supper, but it seems to me to be more of a lesson then a ritual. In versus 17-19 Paul says he hears there has been squabbling. 20-22 he's reminding them they're at worship, not at home. 23-26 he reminds them of the last supper. 27-32 he calls for introspection and restraint, and 33-34 he tells them to show some manners at the table.\n\n We are obviously reading this differently. Here's the verses from www.biblegateway.com\n 1 Cor 11\n 17 In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. 18 In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. 19 No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. 20 When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, 21 for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. 22 Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! \n 23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" 25 In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" 26 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. \n 27 Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. 28 A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. 29 For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. 30 That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. 31 But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. 32 When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. \n 33 So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. 34 If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. \n And when I come I will give further directions.\n \n Here's how I see it...\n 17 St. Paul is saying he's about to criticise the Church in Corinth\n 18-19 that there are divisions there\n 20 IT IS NOT THE LORD'S SUPPER - that is, just a 'meal' (although the term \"Lord's Supper\" has gained much currency), because\n 21-22 If you are just coming together to eat, eat at your own home\n 23 is St.Paul saying he received this sacrament from the Lord Jesus Christ\n 24-26 is a repeat of the sacrament from St.Mat/St.Luke/St.Mark\n 27-28 IF YOU PARTAKE OF THIS DO SO IN A WORTHY MANNER\n 29 ANYONE WHO HAS THIS WITHOUT RECOGNIZING THE BODY OF THE LORD IS SINNING\n 30-32 This is why the people in Corinth are sick\n 33-34 A reminder that if you're after food, eat at home, because this sacrament is not about a meal, it's about the Body of Christ.\n \n You probably know better than I, but these letters were written somewhere around 50-60 AD, yes? The Christians were persecuted, and meeting in people's homes. I believe, and will try to confirm if you disagree, that the custom was often to serve a meal at some point during the gathering. It sounds like some members of the Corinthian congregation were hogging the food or starting to eat before everyone got there, and Paul is telling them to slow down, show some restraint and dignity, and remember the sacrifice of Christ every time you sit to eat and drink bread and wine.\n\n www.earlychristianwritings.com gives the time of writing as 50-60AD, yes (I have as yet any reason to doubt their timing).\n If you're talking about the persecutions of Nero (?) the first wide-spread attacks on Christianity they began after the dating period of 1 Corinthians... c.64AD. However, as he's talking about divisions already there, we can assume that the Corinthians have been doing things the wrong way for a while. Further to this, there's no reason for me to believe that an institution Jesus established (by command: \"Do this in memory of me\") would fall into lapse, especially the premier sacrament of the church. We have evidence from earlier events...Note Jesus also said \"This is my Body\"\n According to Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary the term 'breaking of bread' was used synonymously with the Eucharist (Though St.Paul would remind people that it's not mere bread.)\n Lord's Supper - (1 Cor. 11:20), called also \"the Lord's table\" (10:21), \"communion,\" \"cup of blessing\" (10:16), and \"breaking of bread\" (Acts 2:42). \n In the early Church it was called also \"Eucharist,\" or giving of thanks (comp. Matt. 26:27), and generally by the Latin Church \"mass,\" a name derived from the formula of dismission, Ite, missa est, i.e., \"Go, it is discharged.\n http://www.ccel.org/e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0002300.html#T0002318\n IF this is true, then we have further early evidences from the Book of Acts, which, though written later, recounts earlier events...\n Acts 2\n The Fellowship of the Believers \n 42 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.\n Suggests strongly that they were performing the sacrament.\n as does\n Acts 2\n 46 Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts\n Acts 20\n Eutychus Raised From the Dead at Troas \n 7 On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight.\n \n The words that Paul uses are the words of the Holy Eucharist, but read in context I don't think he's talking about the Eucharist in the sense you mean at all. It sounds to me like he's saying that whenever you sit down to bread and wine, (sit down to a meal back then) you should remember the last supper and Jesus, and act accordingly.\n\n In the early Church it was called also \"Eucharist,\" or giving of thanks (comp. Matt. 26:27), and generally by the Latin Church \"mass,\" a name derived from the formula of dismission, Ite, missa est, i.e., \"Go, it is discharged.\"\n http://christianity.about.com/library/weekly/blT0002300.htm#T0002318\n It is probably this mixing up of terms that got people confused; and still has people confused. However, on the issue of a meal, or a sacrament...other times St.Paul reinforces that it's the Body and Blood...\n 1 Corinthians 10\n 16 Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?\n Further, I suggested the Didache as another source and it is dated as early as 50AD.\n The notion of the actual body and blood is prefigured in earlier passages by, for example...\n Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him\" (Jn 6:56)\n and\n \"Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me\" (Jn 6:57).\n \n IN SUMMARY\n The institution of the Eucharist is founded by Jesus in the Gospels of Sts. Matthew, Mark, and Luke. It's also pre-figured in the Gospel of St. John. The Book of Acts shows the continuity with people of the early church partaking in it, though some begin to consider it only a token meal to which St.Paul responds with 1 Cor 11:20ff and 1 Cor 10:16 saying that it is the Body and Blood of Christ.\n Outside early sources such as the Didache confirm this, as do the rantings of pagans (see Post #1) who accused the Christian community of cannibalism.\n \n And\n Despite Kronus attempt at sensationalism, the issue of a young girl with a rare disease is not 'an issue' with the Catholic Church as she's able, according to their doctrine, partake of 'both kinds' when she has the wine alone. It doesn't prove the transubstantiation a fraud, it doesn't prove anything like that as she's not been tested to see if she'd be sick if she did have the bread, because she's not going to be given the bread anyway.",

   "I don't think any attempts at sensationalism on my part could cause an issue in the Catholic church, I just don't have that much pull.\n\n You are not alone in attacking something that's not an issue.\n \n And you've misread me. I never said we had proof, I said if she ate it and got sick that would be an argument against the actuality of the miracle.\n\n Yes, that's a very big 'what if', and despite the fact it's a 'what if', you're still willing to run with it. You're merely posting an argument based on speculation - 'if' this happens she 'might' get sick proving 'x'. It's nice to state this... though it's not very informative except that you are willing to make such thinly veiled attacks on a particular church... or else why post such bare-bones speculation?\n \n The whole article you posted is anti-truth\n \"It is a dilemma,\" said Monarch. \"It is a major frustration that someone who wants to follow their religion is restricted from doing so because some churches will not allow it.\"\n http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/104-08122004-346938.html\n Clearly that's not the case as the Catholic Church says she can have the Eucharist in the form of wine. They are not preventing her following her religion at all. As stated, and I think I've been honest, it might be an issue of the Orthodox Church, but definitely NOT the Catholic Church. I have cited doctrine on the issue... it could be, of course said, that the local priests aren't aware of this option of wine only.\n \n However, I do find the fact that no-one, not her mother, not her priests, and not you, is actually saying \"Go ahead and eat it, a miracle will occur and you'll be fine\" to be telling.\n\n I think the only one actually asking her not to eat the wheat-based bread is her mother. Based on this you're again willing to cast a little doubt on the transubstantiation. A priest who actually shows he's willing to accomate her, in so far as accommodate her worries has offered her an alternate source, but for you that's now further evidence too. They basically are doing nothing right, as far as you're concerned.\n Further you're willing to speculate in every case in a manner so as to cast a negative image on this issue; that it 'is' an issue; when it's not, that is 'might' disprove transubstantiation 'if' she did get sick, etc.\n As she doesn't have to eat the bread to get the Eucharist - according to Catholic dogma - there's simply no reason for her to 'test' God on the issue.\n \n Anyway, you've made a fine effort to make a mountain out of a mole-hill. Kudos.\n \n PS\n I note too you've made no response to the fact you've completely misread 1 Cor 11 with regard to the Eucharist... if you want to return to that debate, I'd be the first to welcome it.",

   "\n I note too you've made no response to the fact you've completely misread 1 Cor 11 with regard to the Eucharist... if you want to return to that debate, I'd be the first to welcome it.\n\n \n That's because reading your posts is a little like reading the Bible. Sometimes you have to read the same passage a few times before you can figure out what's being said.\n \n You have, in fact, given no proof that your reading is any better than mine. If you could show that all the other congregations at the time were practicing the Eucharist, that would be some evidence that 1 Cor 11 is about doing it incorrectly. As it is, if you read it without preconceived notions, it simply sounds like Paul is berating them for bad table manners.\n \n Your overall point here, and correct me if I'm wrong (like I have to ask), is that the Eucharist was practiced continuously from the time of the crucifiction on, yes? Even if that is true, it would be almost impossible to prove, wouldn't it? Very little documentation about early christian practices exists. Not even the originals of the works that ended up in the Bible are still around. \n \n One last point of clarification I need. What, precisely, do you mean by the Eucharist? The reason that I ask is that the ceremony I've seen goes something like this. Priest has some bread and wine, blesses them, adds holy water to the wine, says the \"this is my body...\" lines, and invites those who are going to participate to come up. People go up, kneel, get a bit of bread and a sip of wine, go back to pew. What Jesus did was pass around a loaf of bread and a cup of wine; a different act. When you say the Eucharist was practicied continuously, which act do you mean? A, B, B changing into A?",

   "Greetings to Montalban and All:\n \n Terral opens << Thank you very much for starting this thread on your Holy Eucharist ritual. Although, I must admit to being a little put off by the fact that this post does not appear in the \"Bible Doctrine\" section of this Forum. This side of the debate vows to stay focused upon the topic and hand, without the emotionalism displayed in our previous encounter on this very topic. \n \n \nMontalban << The Holy Eucharist is the oldest experience of Christian Worship as well as the most distinctive. Eucharist comes from the Greek word which means thanksgiving.\n \n \n Terral's reply << There are three Greek words that pertain to this case. eucharisteo (2168; verb), eucharistia (2169; noun) and eucharistos (2170; adjective). The first two are derived from the adjective. \n \n We can see Vine's Definitions here: http://www.menfak.no/bibelprog/vines?word=\u00aft0002952 \n \n You say that Eucharist (a noun) comes from the Greek word which means thanksgiving, but do not say which Greek word. In a previous post you tied Eucharist to 'eucharistia,' which is indeed the noun. However, the noun form of this word does not appear in any of the Four Gospels, and is not translated into any form of 'thanks' in any of them. Eucharistia does appear in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians (1Cor. 14:16), but not in the chapter 11 verses you quote, and once in his second Corinthian letter (2Cor. 9:11). \n \n The word used in Matthew, Mark and Luke, where Christ gives 'thanks' at the Lord's Passover meal is the verb eucharisteo (Matt. 26:27, Mark 14:23, Luke 22:19). Note that Christ uses the same word in a previous example in each of these Gospel accounts. \"And He took the seven loaves and the fish; and giving THANKS, He broke them and started giving them to the disciples, and the disciples {gave them} to the people.\" Matt. 15:36, Mark 8:6 (almost identical). We should note that these two examples of 'eucharisteo' (translated 'thanks') represent the only other times that the verb form is used in the Gospel accounts of Matthew and Mark. Most Christians I know 'give thanks' at every meal 'in remembrance' of our Lord.\n \n \nMontalban << In a particular sense, the word describes the most important form of the Church's attitude toward all of life. The origin of the Eucharist is traced to the Last Supper at which Christ instructed His disciples to offer bread and wine in His memory.\n \n \n Terral's reply << After examining every use of all these words, I see Christ and everyone else 'giving thanks,' and being 'thankful.' What I do not see is anyone in Scripture establishing a 'Holy Eucharist' ritual to be performed by Christian Churches at every meeting. Certain groups of professing Christians have taken the verb form of this Greek word and have created a religious ceremonial ritual, that is based upon what Christ did at the Lord's Passover described in Matthew 26. There are many important things that nobody has mentioned in these first twenty or so posts. \n \n 1. What is Christ actually doing at this Last Supper, \n \n Answer: Christ was performing \"Lord's Passover\" (Exodus 12:11, Lev. 23:5, Num. 28:16), \"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight.\" Lev. 23:5. Every Jewish household performed the same ceremonial ritual all over the known world on this very same day. Many fail to realize that this is more about the sacrifice, cooking in fire (not boiling; Exodus 12:19), and eating of the Passover lamb, than about eating the bread and drinking the wine. \"Then came the {first} day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover {lamb} had to be sacrificed.\" Luke 22:7.\n \n 2. and why is Christ doing it? \n \n Answer: To this day the Lord's Passover is performed by every practicing Jewish household on one particular day of the year, and at a particular time of that day (twilight). This is the commandment of the Lord God, according to Mosaic Law. Lev. 23:5, etc. \n \n 3. Had Christ ever performed this ritual before in His lifetime? \n \n Answer: Absolutely. As did all the other disciples and all practicing Jews. Note again that this aspect of Mosaic Law was performed in the same month on the same exact day every year; on the 14th day. Their months started with each new moon, so the on this 14th day at twilight, the moon was always coming up and full. One can visualize the head of the household going through all of the required parts of this ritual every year, while looking out his window and seeing the same full moon rising. \n \n 4. And, were these Disciples 'legally' obligated to perform this very ritual again in their lifetimes? \n \n Answer: Yes. This Lord's Passover ritual was just as vital to keeping the Law as keeping the Sabbath. Leviticus is the First Book of the Law, and Deuteronomy is the Second Book of the Law. Note that the Lord is actually speaking to Moses in these verses of Leviticus: \n \n \"Lev 23:1 The LORD spoke again to Moses, saying, \"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'The LORD'S appointed times which you shall proclaim as holy convocations--My appointed times are these: For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall not do any work; it is a sabbath to the LORD in all your dwellings. These are the appointed times of the LORD, holy convocations which you shall proclaim at the times appointed for them. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight is the LORD'S Passover.\" Lev. 23:1-5.\n \n \nMontalban << The Eucharist is the most distinctive event of Orthodox worship because in it the Church gathers to remember and celebrate the Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ and, thereby, to participate in the mystery of http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/a...article7077.asp\n\n \n Terral's reply << The mystery of . . .? BTW, if you have not done so already, you should go back and credit this writer for many of your words above. Your article is actually found here: \n \n http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article7077.asp\n \n The outstanding paragraph in his article is this one:\n \n \n\"The Eucharist, the principal sacrament mystery of the Orthodox Church, is not so much a text to be studied, but rather an experience of communion with the Living God in which prayer, music, gestures, the material creation, art and architecture come into full orchestration. The Eucharist is a celebration of faith which touches not only the mind but also the emotions and the senses.\"\n\n \n Terral continues << The reason that your \"Holy Eucharist\" presentation does not appear in the Bible Doctrine section of this Forum is because this stuff just does not appear in our Bible. The Lockman Foundation scholars do not translate any Greek word into 'communion' in the entire New Testament. Vine defines 'koinonia' (#2842) as, \"(a) the share one has with anything\" here: http://www.menfak.no/bibelprog/vines?word=\u00aft0000511 . And 'sacrament'? Forget about it. \n \n Scripture says that our access to God is directly through Christ. \"For through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.\" Eph. 2:18. And that Christ is our intercessor to God.\" Rom. 8:34. Paul does associate the mystery with his ministry and something that is indeed manifested in the saints (all of us), but it has nothing to do with any ceremonial ritual. Scripture says, \n \n \"Of {this church} I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the {preaching of} the word of God, {that is,} the mystery which has been hidden from the {past} ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints, to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is CHRIST IN YOU, the hope of glory.\" Col. 1:25-27 (CAPS for emphasis). \n \n Note that the 'mystery' aspect, \"has been hidden from the ages and generations.\" Does the evidence indicate that the Lord's Passover supper was hidden from anyone? Does Paul or anyone associate the mystery with any ceremonial ritual anywhere in Scripture? No. Also, how can anyone give me a chunk of Christ, when Paul says that, \"this mystery among the Gentiles, which is CHRIST IN YOU.\"? If Christ is already in me, why does anyone need to give Him to me in weekly installments? \n \n \nMontalban << The Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist is to be found in the Bible... St Mat 26 . . .\n\n \n Terral's reply << No sir. The events of Matthew 26 concern themselves with the Lord's Passover, that Christ performed to fulfill Mosaic Law. Our context is found here in the same chapter, \"You know that after two days the Passover is coming . . .\" Matt. 26:2. Again, Christ uses the verb form of giving 'thanks' here, i.e., He thanked God. The fathers of your denomination took the verb from here and transformed it into a noun, and placed the word \"Holy\" in front of it. \n \n \nMontalban << St Matt. 26:26; St Mark. 14:22; St Luke 22:19-20 - the Greek phrase is \"Touto estin to soma mou.\" This phraseology means \"this is actually\" or \"this is really\" my body and blood.\n\n \n Terral's reply << The Greek looks more like this \"tovto eqtl to qwua uov,\" when looking directly at the Greek of the Majority Text. If you will look again, there is no blood in the verse at all. The translation is simply, \"this is My body.\" Your blood comes up in the very next verse (aiua). The 'this is really' part of your translation is imaginary. \n \n \nMontalban << 1 Cor. 11:24 - the same translation is used by Paul - \"touto mou estin to soma.\" The statement is \"this is really\" my body and blood. Nowhere in Scripture does God ever declare something without making it so.\n\n \n Terral's reply << Holy Molies . . . Again, the 'this is really' part is totally fiction. And again, there is no blood in the verse at all. The Greek looks like this, \"tovto uov eqtl to qwua.\" Again, this is simply \"this is My body.\" The blood part comes up in again in the very next verse of Scripture. \n \n \nMontalban << 1 Cor 11 is interesting for it surely puts to rest that the event depicted above in the three Synaptic Gospels is not merely a combative meal. St. Paul says in 1 Cor 11\n\n \n Terra's reply << not merely a combative meal? What on earth does that mean? Christ was eating the Lord's Passover supper, which Paul calls the \"Lord's Supper\" in 1Cor. 11:20. where he says, \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" \n \n \nMontalban << This is a letter of instruction which is saying if it's food you're after, stay at home, for the Eucharist is not a 'meal' of food. The key is in verse 29 where he rebukes any who eats or drinks at the Eucharist without acknowledging that it is the very body and blood of Christ.\n\n \n Terral's reply << The only problem with your interpretation is that the word \"Eucharist\" is not here anywhere. The only 'Lord's Supper' that Paul talks about is performed by every practicing Jew all over the world, according to Mosaic Law. There is no Biblical precedent anywhere for performing any bread and wine ritual, according to your Orthodox descriptions. An other place these kinds of food and drink rituals appear is in Greek Mythology, and the ancient practices associated with \"Love Feast\" rituals. \n \n See here: http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~clit387/Worship.html \n \n \nMontalban << There is evidence from outside the Bible as well. When pagans heard that Christians were eating and drinking of the Body of Christ, they believed that the Christians were cannibals . . . \n \n \n Terral's reply << Paul tells us over and over again that we are members of the body of Christ. \n \n \"For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.\" Rom. 12:4+5.\n \n \"For even as the body is one and {yet} has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit. For the body is not one member, but many.\" 1Cor. 12:12-14.\n \n \"But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired. If they were all one member, where would the body be? But now there are many members, but one body.\" 1Cor. 12:18-20.\n \n \"Now you are Christ's body, and individually members of it.\" 1Cor. 12:27.\n \n \"For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also {does} the church, because we are members of His body.\" Eph. 5:29+30.\n \n Terral continues << Again, if we are members of Christ's body, then how can anyone feed us chunks of Christ's body? If a member of the body of Christ eats a piece of the body of Christ, shouldn't that make him a cannibal? \n \n The weakness of this 'Holy Eucharist' doctrine lies in the very limited Bible support for its very existence. Again, from the article above:\n \n \n\"The Eucharist, the principal sacrament mystery of the Orthodox Church, is not so much a text to be studied, but rather an experience of communion with the Living God in which prayer, music, gestures, the material creation, art and architecture come into full orchestration. The Eucharist is a celebration of faith which touches not only the mind but also the emotions and the senses.\"\n\n \n The orthodox church has created this 'experience of communion' with the 'prayer, music, gestures . . . art . . . orchestration from a very few verses of Scripture taken way out of context. If we go outside of this one chapter, where Paul says, \"when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper,\" (1Cor. 11:20), then he does not mention the Lord's Supper ritual at all. If Paul had intended for us to do this every time we met in church, then his letters would have said so. Instead, he writes, \n \n \"Col 2:16 Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day -- things which are a {mere} shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.\" Col. 2:16+17.\n \n If the Eucharist is a 'celebration of faith,' then why have 'excommunication for some members? Shouldn't a celebration be for everyone? Let's investigate here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunicating\n \n \n\"Eastern Orthodox Communion\n \n In the Orthodox Church, excommunication is the exclusion of a member from the Eucharist. It is not expulsion from the Church. This can happen due to minor reasons like not having confessed within that year or be imposed as part of a penitential period. The Orthodox Church does have a means of expulsion, by pronouncing anathema, but this is reserved only for acts of serious and unrepetant heresy. Even in that case, the individual is not \"damned\" by the Church but is instead left to his own devices.\"\n\n \n How is it that \"NO ONE IS TO ACT AS YOUR JUDGE IN REGARD TO FOOD AND DRINK,\" and yet, some people here judge others unworthy of the celebration. The problem with adopting such rituals is that they place men into the position of the Spirit of God as 'the agent' of our communion (fellowship) with the Father. I have been 'sealed in Him' through obedience to the Gospel. Eph. 1:13+14. The mystery aspect of \"Christ in you\" (Col. 1:27) is already a reality for believers through obedience to the Gospel. Again, those who are in keeping with these 'food and drink' rituals seem to forget that we (the Church) are Christ's body. Paul writes, \n \n \"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions.\" Col. 1:24. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Greetings to Maximus and All:\n \n \nYou asked << Have you ever participated in a \"communion\" service/breaking of the bread at your church?\n\n \n Terral's reply << This seems to be more of a personal note, Maximus, and one that does not lend anything to the discussion. But, to answer your question . . . Yes. I was converted to Catholicism through six months of personal training by Father Renaldo from the Sacred Heart Parish in Pinellas Park, Florida in the mid 1970's. I have sat, stood and knelt through years and years Catholic Masses, and made myself aware of many teachings of the RC Church. And, no sir, I have not participated in any 'communion' service in the past 25 years. \n \n If I may add a few notes: My concern with this topic is over that fact that these things represent a form of idolatry. What does Scripture say? \n \n \n\"Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was being provoked within him as he was observing the city full of idols.\" Acts 17:16.\n \n \n This Greek word for giving 'thanks' (Verb, 2168, eucharisteo) is used only twice in the Gospel of Matthew, and the noun (2169, eucharistia) is not present at all. Please try and guess how many times Paul uses a form of the word 'idol' in his first letter to the Corinthians? Would you think maybe five times in a single letter? How about ten times? Or, would you believe Paul and the Holy Spirit take this opportunity to warn them fifteen times? Because that is the correct answer. Here are all those listings:\n \n \n\"I {did} not at all {mean} with the immoral people of this world, or with the covetous and swindlers, or with idolaters [#1], for then you would have to go out of the world.\" 1Cor. 5:10.\n \n \"But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater [#2], or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler--not even to eat with such a one.\" 1Cor. 5:11.\n \n \"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters [#3], nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals.\" 1Cor. 6:9.\n \n \"Now concerning things sacrificed to idols [#4], we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies.\" 1Cor. 8:1.\n \n \"Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols [#5], we know that there is no such thing as an idol [#6] in the world, and that there is no God but one.\" 1Cor. 8:4.\n \n \"However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being accustomed to the idol [#7] until now, eat {food} as if it were sacrificed to an idol [#8]; and their conscience being weak is defiled.\" 1Cor. 8:7.\n \n \"For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol's [#9] temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols [#10]?\" 1Cor. 8:10.\n \n \"Do not be idolaters [#11], as some of them were; as it is written, \"THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK, AND STOOD UP TO PLAY.\" 1Cor. 10:7.\n \n \"Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry [#12].\" 1Cor. 10:14.\n \n \"What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols [#13] is anything, or that an idol is anything?\" 1Cor. 10:19.\n \n \"But if anyone says to you, \"This is meat sacrificed to idols [#14],\" do not eat {it,} for the sake of the one who informed {you,} and for conscience' sake.\" 1Cor. 10:28.\n \n \"You know that when you were pagans, {you were} led astray to the mute idols [#15], however you were led.\" 1Cor. 12:2.\n\n \n The problem of idolatry that Paul finds in Greece among these Gentiles is nearly restricted to this one church. My brother was in the navy and can tell you numerous stories about port cities that he visited all over the Mediterranean Sea. I also have walked some of those beaches and seen things not worthy of mention here. But Corinth was unique in that it was a two port city. We can read about it here: http://www.abrock.com/Greece-Turkey/corinth.html . Here is part:\n \n \n\"Commentators usually assume that Corinth was an especially licentious city, a reputation it seems to have had in ancient times. Indeed, one of the Greek verbs for fornicate was korinthiazomai,a word derived from the city's name. Apparently this estimation was based on Strabo's report of 1,000 sacred prostitutes in the temple of Aphrodite on the Acrocorinth, an 1886-foot hill that rises above the city to the south.\"\n\n \n Someone who was caught in the act of fornication was said to be, \"playing the Corinthian.\" When we read Paul's letters to these Corinthians, we should realize that he is addressing people who were familiar with the Love Feasts of that time period. They were bringing in their rituals from the Aphrodite temples to the point of being drunk (1Cor. 11:21). The command from Paul is to \"eat at home\" (vs. 34). \"What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink?\" 1Cor. 11:22. Are these the words of a man instituting a Holy Eucharist Communion Ritual to be performed by church leaders at every meeting? \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20? And even if Paul ever had that intention, what on earth would lead anyone to believe that he would do so in a letter to these fleshy Corinthians?! Here is the truth of what Paul thought of these people in a nutshell:\n \n \n\"And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able {to receive it.} Indeed, even now you are not yet able, for you are still fleshly.\" 1Cor. 3:1-3.\n\n \n How many times do we see Christ or anyone in the Four Gospels even mentioning idolatry? Answer: Zero. Luke mentions the \"sacrifice to the idol\" from back in Egypt (Acts 7:41), but beyond that only Paul uses the word and only in this first letter to the Corinthians. NASB. Peter uses a form of the word only once, and he is talking about Gentiles.\n \n \n\"For the time already past is sufficient {for} {you} to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties and abominable idolatries.\" 1Pet. 4:3.\n\n \n John also uses the word only once, in the very last verse of his first letter.\n \n \n\"Little children, guard yourselves from idols.\" 1John 5:21.\n\n \n If professing Christians today want to say words over bread and wine, and pretend that these physical things 'really' are the body and blood of Christ, then so be it. Although, it is beyond me how they can teach, that the church itself is also the body of Christ (Eph. 4:12, 5:30, Col. 1:24, etc.) in the same breath. This form of idolatry ran rampant along side early Christianity in the Greek (Aphrodite temples) and Roman (Athena temples) Churches. Maybe that is why some among us get upset at being called a 'Greek Orthodox.' \n \n Just as I once took part in these fleshy rituals of idolatry, others are continuing to experience stunted spiritual growth because of these things. Nobody on earth can hand you a piece of Christ in bread, or His blood in a cup. Those are mere shadows of the things that are spiritual in essence. Col. 2:16+17. Dependence upon these physical symbols (idols) does nothing but blind you to the truth, that all of these things are really of the Spirit of God.\n \n Our 'one baptism' (Eph. 4:5) has absolutely nothing to do with any priest or water. We are baptized by the Spirit of God (1Cor. 12:13) into Christ's body on the cross (Rom. 6:3+4) the moment we hear (Rom. 10:17) and believe the gospel. Eph. 1:13+14. That is how we 'commune' with Christ; through the gospel. The priest and the water are mere symbols, and some among us have made them idols by placing them in the position of God's Spirit. In the very same way some among us are using a man and a cup, in the place of the Spirit of God, and continue to depend upon those physical things to give them a piece of Christ. Instead, we are the body of Christ already. That is the point of Paul's teachings in this first letter to the Corinthians. \n \n \n\"Now you are Christ's body, and individually members of it.\" 1Cor. 12:27.\n\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "That's because reading your posts is a little like reading the Bible. Sometimes you have to read the same passage a few times before you can figure out what's being said.\n \n You have, in fact, given no proof that your reading is any better than mine. If you could show that all the other congregations at the time were practicing the Eucharist, that would be some evidence that 1 Cor 11 is about doing it incorrectly. As it is, if you read it without preconceived notions, it simply sounds like Paul is berating them for bad table manners.\n \n Your overall point here, and correct me if I'm wrong (like I have to ask), is that the Eucharist was practiced continuously from the time of the crucifiction on, yes? Even if that is true, it would be almost impossible to prove, wouldn't it? Very little documentation about early christian practices exists. Not even the originals of the works that ended up in the Bible are still around. \n \n One last point of clarification I need. What, precisely, do you mean by the Eucharist? The reason that I ask is that the ceremony I've seen goes something like this. Priest has some bread and wine, blesses them, adds holy water to the wine, says the \"this is my body...\" lines, and invites those who are going to participate to come up. People go up, kneel, get a bit of bread and a sip of wine, go back to pew. What Jesus did was pass around a loaf of bread and a cup of wine; a different act. When you say the Eucharist was practicied continuously, which act do you mean? A, B, B changing into A?\n\n \n I already pointed to evidence of the early church. Are you sure you're not Mizmaxx, because she's the same, doesn't read the posts, then asks questions already answered.\n \n The answer is in the first post.\n Evidence from the Bible\n Evidence from outside the Bible (Christian) - in the Didache\n Evidence from outside the Bible (non-Christian) - where pagans thought Christians were cannibals\n \n Further to that I added evidence from Acts.\n \n Further to 'my reading' of the Scripture, you happen also to ignore the biggest Christian denominations, clearly over half, just happen to agree with 'my interpretation' (but that would be an arrogant way of putting it for it's not 'my interpretation' as you attempt to personalise this to the point of pretending it's just my 'opinion' -v- your own). Catholics, Orthodox, Copts, (High Church) Anglicans believe in it.\n \n Jesus broke the bread, the priest breaks the bread.\n Jesus said \"this is My body\"\n The Priest says that.\n Jesus took the wine. As does the priest\n The Priest says the same thing Jesus said.\n The bread and wine became the Body and Blood of Christ in the first act, and continues to happen now.\n It wouldn't matter if it's in a church, in a room upstairs somewhere (as with Jesus) You seem overly concerned with where it happens, or that there's extra seating - pews. Another rather odd argument to make.\n \n Further to 'proof' I think it's a rather odd argument you make. We have accounts of it in Acts, the Didache, from Christian tradition, from pagan criticisisms, from the fact it's the most central part of the Liturgy. Like Mizmaxx again, you cast a wee bit of doubt that it might not be. And you're satisfied with that.",

   "Greetings to Montalban and All:\n Terral opens << \n\n Do you need to do this? When you begin, you don't need to anounce you are beginning. It's taken as read by the fact it's the beginning, and it's you saying it. Also, when you reply you don't need to state \"Terral's reply <<\" for the same reason people can tell that it's your reply when you're writing it.\n \nThe Holy Eucharist is the oldest experience of Christian Worship as well as the most distinctive. Eucharist comes from the Greek word which means thanksgiving.\n\n \n\n Terral?s reply << There are three Greek words that pertain to this case. eucharisteo (2168; verb), eucharistia (2169; noun) and eucharistos (2170; adjective). The first two are derived from the adjective. \n We can see Vine?s Definitions here: http://www.menfak.no/bibelprog/vines?word=\u00aft0002952 \n You say that Eucharist (a noun) comes from the Greek word which means thanksgiving, but do not say which Greek word. In a previous post you tied Eucharist to ?eucharistia,? which is indeed the noun. However, the noun form of this word does not appear in any of the Four Gospels, and is not translated into any form of ?thanks? in any of them. Eucharistia does appear in Paul?s first letter to the Corinthians (1Cor. 14:16), but not in the chapter 11 verses you quote, and once in his second Corinthian letter (2Cor. 9:11). \n\n I've no idea what your point is. You say you believe in the Trinity. Show me the verse of the Bible the word \"Trinity\" appears in... which sort of goes to show you that you can't rely solely on the Bible.\n \nThe word used in Matthew, Mark and Luke, where Christ gives ?thanks? at the Lord?s Passover meal is the verb eucharisteo (Matt. 26:27, Mark 14:23, Luke 22:19). Note that Christ uses the same word in a previous example in each of these Gospel accounts. ?And He took the seven loaves and the fish; and giving THANKS, He broke them and started giving them to the disciples, and the disciples {gave them} to the people.? Matt. 15:36, Mark 8:6 (almost identical). We should note that these two examples of ?eucharisteo? (translated ?thanks?) represent the only other times that the verb form is used in the Gospel accounts of Matthew and Mark. Most Christians I know ?give thanks? at every meal ?in remembrance? of our Lord.\n\n Further to that He said \"This is the New Covenant\", plus the command \"Do this in memory of me\"\n \nIn a particular sense, the word describes the most important form of the Church's attitude toward all of life. The origin of the Eucharist is traced to the Last Supper at which Christ instructed His disciples to offer bread and wine in His memory. \n\n \nAfter examining every use of all these words, I see Christ and everyone else ?giving thanks,? and being ?thankful.? What I do not see is anyone in Scripture establishing a ?Holy Eucharist? ritual to be performed by Christian Churches at every meeting. Certain groups of professing Christians have taken the verb form of this Greek word and have created a religious ceremonial ritual, that is based upon what Christ did at the Lord?s Passover described in Matthew 26. There are many important things that nobody has mentioned in these first twenty or so posts.\n\n Your own post re: 1 Cor 11 shows that it's not just a meal of thanks.\n \n1. What is Christ actually doing at this Last Supper, \n Answer: Christ was performing ?Lord?s Passover? (Exodus 12:11, Lev. 23:5, Num. 28:16), ?In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight.? Lev. 23:5. Every Jewish household performed the same ceremonial ritual all over the known world on this very same day. Many fail to realize that this is more about the sacrifice, cooking in fire (not boiling; Exodus 12:19), and eating of the Passover lamb, than about eating the bread and drinking the wine. ?Then came the {first} day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover {lamb} had to be sacrificed.? Luke 22:7.\n\n No. It is a transitional time. They met at Passover, but He said \"This is the New Covenant\", He is ending all Passovers once and for all and is establishing a new tradition.\n \n2. and why is Christ doing it? \n Answer: To this day the Lord?s Passover is performed by every practicing Jewish household on one particular day of the year, and at a particular time of that day (twilight). This is the commandment of the Lord God, according to Mosaic Law. Lev. 23:5, etc.\n\n Yes, Jesus came to fulfill the law. We are not Jews, however.\n \n 3. Had Christ ever performed this ritual before in His lifetime? \n Answer: Absolutely. As did all the other disciples and all practicing Jews. Note again that this aspect of Mosaic Law was performed in the same month on the same exact day every year; on the 14th day. Their months started with each new moon, so the on this 14th day at twilight, the moon was always coming up and full. One can visualize the head of the household going through all of the required parts of this ritual every year, while looking out his window and seeing the same full moon rising. \n\n ditto\n \n4. And, were these Disciples ?legally? obligated to perform this very ritual again in their lifetimes? \n Answer: Yes. This Lord?s Passover ritual was just as vital to keeping the Law as keeping the Sabbath. Leviticus is the First Book of the Law, and Deuteronomy is the Second Book of the Law. Note that the Lord is actually speaking to Moses in these verses of Leviticus:\n\n Then you've argued that the Jewish traditions should be maintained... or else why don't we have them now?\n \nThe Eucharist is the most distinctive event of Orthodox worship because in it the Church gathers to remember and celebrate the Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ and, thereby, to participate in the mystery of http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/a...article7077.asp \n\n \nThe mystery of . . .? BTW, if you have not done so already, you should go back and credit this writer for many of your words above. Your article is actually found here: http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/a...article7077.asp \n\n Which words?\n \nThe outstanding paragraph in his article is this one:\n ?The Eucharist, the principal sacrament mystery of the Orthodox Church, is not so much a text to be studied, but rather an experience of communion with the Living God in which prayer, music, gestures, the material creation, art and architecture come into full orchestration. The Eucharist is a celebration of faith which touches not only the mind but also the emotions and the senses.? \n\n Yes, in the Orthodox Liturgy all our senses are set on fire by the real presence of the Body and Blood of Christ. It is a celebration of faith in Jesus as Christ.\n \nThe reason that your ?Holy Eucharist? presentation does not appear in the Bible Doctrine section of this Forum is because this stuff just does not appear in our Bible. The Lockman Foundation scholars do not translate any Greek word into ?communion? in the entire New Testament. Vine defines ?koinonia? (#2842) as, ?(a) the share one has with anything? here: http://www.menfak.no/bibelprog/vines?word=\u00aft0000511 . And ?sacrament?? Forget about it.\n\n You forget your own retort re: 1 Cor 11\n \nScripture says that our access to God is directly through Christ. ?For through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.? Eph. 2:18. And that Christ is our intercessor to God.? Rom. 8:34. Paul does associate the mystery with his ministry and something that is indeed manifested in the saints (all of us), but it has nothing to do with any ceremonial ritual. Scripture says, \n\n Yes, and we have this through His Body and Blood, at the Eucharist. Your problem?\n \n?Of {this church} I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the {preaching of} the word of God, {that is,} the mystery which has been hidden from the {past} ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints, to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is CHRIST IN YOU, the hope of glory.? Col. 1:25-27 (CAPS for emphasis). \n\n Show me where 'steward' appears I did a search at www.biblegateway.com and see that you have no problem here using words that don't exist in the Bible, but the concept does. So that's two out of three\n Eucharist - not written there; concept there\n Trinity - not written there, concept there\n Steward - not written there, concept there\n \n Note that the ?mystery? aspect, ?has been hidden from the ages and generations.? Does the evidence indicate that the Lord?s Passover supper was hidden from anyone? Does Paul or anyone associate the mystery with any ceremonial ritual anywhere in Scripture? No. Also, how can anyone give me a chunk of Christ, when Paul says that, ?this mystery among the Gentiles, which is CHRIST IN YOU.?? If Christ is already in me, why does anyone need to give Him to me in weekly installments? \n\n How does Christ get in you?\n \n For now, that'll have to do",

Show me the verse of the Bible the word \"Trinity\" appears in... which sort of goes to show you that you can't rely solely on the Bible.\n\n \n My point is to demonstrate where the key words in this discussion appear in the Text, and where they do not. You are comparing apples to oranges here. The trinity is found throughout Scripture. \"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.\" Matt. 28:19. \n \n John the Baptist was sent by God (John 1:6), Christ is the Son (John 1:34) and the Holy Spirit began offering the same gospel to Israel in Acts 2:1-4. John testifies that there are three that bear witness, \"the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are into the One.\" 1John 5:8. When we couple this information with the plurality 'Us' in Genesis 1:26 (\"Let Us make man in Our image\"), then I see a triune God at work. Why? Because, the image of man is spirit, water (body) and blood (soul), which is also 'three into the one.\" A doctrine is anything taught in precepts. I see the precepts of the trinity throughout Scripture. \n \n In each case, the key words, and proof of the Three Witnesses of our God, appear as nouns or pronouns. Those key words are not nouns derived from adjectives and verbs, as in your Holy Eucharist case. No sir, your Holy Eucharist is a man-made invention that has turned 'thanks' into a ritual of idolatry. Your word 'Eucharist' is not even a translation into English, but a forged human attempt at reworking the actual Greek in the original form (Eucharisteo into Eucharist). \n \n I can take the words \"Father, Son and Holy Spirit\" (from Matthew 28:19) and make a reasonable case for the Trinity doctrine from the original Greek. I cannot do the same thing with the two verb references to 'eucharisteo' in the Gospel of Matthew; especially when the noun form is not even used in any of the Four Gospel accounts. All of these points work together to prove beyond doubt that this Holy Eucharist Communion Ceremonial Ritualistic offering of Christ's body over and over and over again is NOT based upon one thing written in our Bibles. My 'case' is not based upon the single verse of Scripture, as you suggested to everyone in our recent discussion, where Paul says, \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral << The word used in Matthew, Mark and Luke, where Christ gives 'thanks' at the Lord's Passover meal is the verb eucharisteo (Matt. 26:27, Mark 14:23, Luke 22:19). Note that Christ uses the same word in a previous example in each of these Gospel accounts. \"And He took the seven loaves and the fish; and giving THANKS, He broke them. . .\"\n\n \n \nMontalban's original reply << Further to that He said \"This is the New Covenant\", plus the command \"Do this in memory of me\" \n \n \n First, why quote me if there is no intention of meeting the objection raised in my point? The Scriptural evidence shows that Christ used this same 'eucharisteo' word in giving 'thanks' to God in the examples above. Was Christ performing your Eucharist ritual with these seven loaves and fish? Why the inconsistency here? After all, Christ only used the 'eucharisteo' word twice in the entire account. Why then are you not just as eager to prove Christ was instituting a Holy Eucharist Ceremonial Ritual in Matthew 15:36? Hey! Seven loaves for Seven Sacraments. Maybe we are on to something . . . Not. Do these facts appear to prove, or disprove, the validity of the Holy Eucharist doctrine? The third party reader can decide. \n \n To address your point on the New Covenant: Christ's words concerning the New Covenant represent His intentions to fulfill of the Lord's Passover (He would do that, however, on the cross). These words to the disciples represent no small event indeed, as it pertains to the 'bride of Christ.' Remember that Christ spoke those words to Jews only, as He was performing the Lord's Passover supper ritual. That is the proper context in which these things were done. And, He did these things prior to revealing 'our gospel' to Paul (Gal. 1:11+12). It is one thing to be part of a New Covenant with the Lord, and quite another to be baptized into His body (Rom. 6:3+4, 1Cor. 12:13). \n \n What is a covenant, but a promise to do something in the future? Christ's words at the Last Supper are pointing to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb (Rev. 19:5-10). Remember again that Peter and the Twelve are called the \"servants (sons/groomsmen) of the bridal chamber.\" Mark 2:19. And, let us not forget the words of John the Baptist, which apply here, \n \n \n\"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine has been made full.\" John 3:29.\n \n \n Those from the Kingdom of God on earth shall be prepared for their marriage to the Lamb during the coming Kingdom Dispensation. Those among us who are obedient to Paul's gospel (Rom.2:16, 16:25, etc.) have been baptized into His body already. Please consider this very carefully, for this is wisdom: Paul's Epistles represent the marching orders for the members of the body of Christ TODAY. Peter, John and James are writing to members of the bride of Christ who shall live through the coming Kingdom Dispensation. \n \n I describe the differences in the bride (Kingdom Administration) and body (Grace Dispensation) here: \n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2556 \n \n \nOriginally Posted by Montalban << In a particular sense, the word describes the most important form of the Church's attitude toward all of life. The origin of the Eucharist is traced to the Last Supper at which Christ instructed His disciples to offer bread and wine in His memory.\n \n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral << After examining every use of all these words, I see Christ and everyone else 'giving thanks,' and being 'thankful.' What I do not see is anyone in Scripture establishing a 'Holy Eucharist' ritual to be performed by Christian Churches at every meeting . . .\n\n \n \nMontalban's reply << Your own post re: 1 Cor 11 shows that it's not just a meal of thanks. \n \n \n Please stop sidetracking, Montalban. Our words above are not about the Lord's Passover Supper itself, but about 'the word' Eucharist. You are the one who tied \"the word describes . . .\" and \"The origin of the Eucharist . . . \" in your statements above. Not me. These fleshy Corinthians were bringing in their food and drink Love Feast rituals from the Temples of Aphrodite. It is in your mind that Paul is giving out instructions on how to properly institute all of this ritualistic mumbo jumbo, when in reality he is saying, \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20. These carnal Christians were getting drunk (vs. 22) and he told them to 'eat at home.' 1Cor. 11:34. \"What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink?\" 1Cor. 11:22. Christ said, \"do this, as often as you drink in remembrance of Me.\" 1Cor. 11:25. That means as often as you drink, Montalban, and not just during these man-made rituals. So we say grace and give thanks at every meal. \n \n \nMontalban original << No. It is a transitional time. They met at Passover, but He said \"This is the New Covenant\", He is ending all Passovers once and for all and is establishing a new tradition. \n \n \n Terral's reply << No sir, not even close. What did Christ say about the Law? \"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others {to do} the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches {them,} he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\" Matt. 5:17-19.\n \n What does James write as Scripture some 20 years after Christ performed this Last Supper ceremony? \"For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one {point,} he has become guilty of all.\" James 2:10. So you say, \"Yea, but none of us keep the Passover year by year, because Christ fulfilled the Law.\" But I say, \"Mosaic Law never applied to Gentiles in the first place!\" Rom. 2:14. Paul writes to members of the body of Christ, saying, \"For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.\" Rom. 10:4. That is true for those who have been baptized into His body, and participated in His death, burial and resurrection (Rom. 6:3+4) through Paul's gospel. Paul did not say that Christ was the end of the law FOR EVERYONE. \n \n Let us not forget that Christ Himself sent Paul down to submit \"the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles\" (Gal. 2:2), to Peter, John and James, some twenty years after the crucifixion (Acts 15). Peter was still preaching the 'gospel of the kingdom,' with the precepts of repentance and water baptism for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38). It is according to Paul's gospel (according to the revelation of the mystery; Rom. 16:25) that \"we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace.\" Eph. 1:7. There are two gospel messages being preached by each of these two groups (Peter's gospel; gospel of the kingdom, Paul's gospel; gospel of the grace of God). See Gal. 2:7. I describe the differences here: \n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2509\n \n \nMontalban << Then you've argued that the Jewish traditions should be maintained... or else why don't we have them now? \n \n \n Terral's reply << Because Mosaic Law never applied to Gentiles. \"For when Gentiles WHO DO NOT HAVE THE LAW do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves.\" Rom. 2:14. All of Mosaic Law still applies to Israel of the flesh, whether they are Orthodox or Messianic Jews. James 2:10. If, however, they believe Paul's gospel, that Christ is the Son of God, that He died at Calvary, was buried in the tomb, and that God raised Him from the dead on the third day (1Cor. 15:1-4), then they are members of the Body of Christ, and are no longer under Mosaic Law. Rom. 10:4. \n \n Take careful note that Paul was almost killed for the spread of this very teaching. And Paul had to be very careful around the people from James. \n \n \n\"And the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. After he had greeted them, he {began} to relate one by one the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. And when they heard it they {began} glorifying God; and they said to him, \"You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law; and they have been told about you, that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs.\" Acts 21:18-21.\n\n \n Now why do you suppose that these of these Jewish believers were 'zealous for the Law?' These events in Acts 21 occur in about 59 or 60 Ad.. The Epistle of James is dated to around 50 Ad.; just after the meeting in Jerusalem (Acts 15). So these Jewish believers were following James' words exactly, which again said, \"For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one {point,} he has become guilty of all.\" James 2:10. \n \n These men with James are members of the 'bride of Christ,' while Paul's 'end of the Law' doctrine pertains to the 'body of Christ.' And that is why James reports this problem, \"and they have been told about you, that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs.\" Acts 21:21. Paul does so in his letter to the Galatians here: \n \n \n\"Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you. And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.\" Gal. 5:2+3.\n\n \n Ahhh, here is that phrase again, \"that he is under obligation to keep the 'whole Law.' Why? The members of the 'bride of Christ' must keep the whole Law, while the members of the 'body of Christ' have been freed from it. We cannot take Paul's words from his Gentile Epistles and apply them to members of the bride of Christ. Those two groups are the subject of two totally different bodies of doctrine. That is why we see Paul going one direction (to Gentiles), and Peter, John and James going another (to the circumcised). Gal. 2:9. \n \n To complete my thought on James versus Paul in Acts 21: Paul submitted to James' request to go under a vow. Acts 21:23-26. The end result is that Paul is beaten to within an inch of his life, and rescued by Romans. Verse 32. This entire encounter could never happen, if James and Paul taught the same precepts of doctrine. But, Paul teaches justification by faith alone (Rom. 4:5) and Christ fulfilling the Law (Rom. 10:4), while James teaches justification through faith and works (James 2:20-24) and total obedience to the Law (James 2:10).\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral << Scripture says that our access to God is directly through Christ. \"For through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.\" Eph. 2:18. And that Christ is our intercessor to God.\" Rom. 8:34. Paul does associate the mystery with his ministry and something that is indeed manifested in the saints (all of us), but it has nothing to do with any ceremonial ritual., \n \n \n \nMontalban's reply << Yes, and we have this through His Body and Blood, at the Eucharist. Your problem? \n \n \n No, this Holy Eucharist Communion Ritual Mumbo Jumbo has nothing to do with anything. That is the point of all the analysis of the Greek terms in the case. I understand that you do not get the point, Montalban. The fact that this man-made ritual appears in your history books is good enough for you. My problem is in the fact that performing this hocus pocus \"This is really His body and blood\" sacrificial ceremony over and over again is a very destructive form of I.D.O.L.A.T.R.Y. One last time . . . \"Now you are Christ's body, and individually members of it.\" 1Cor. 12:27. The Church is Christ's body, Montalban. We were baptized into the body by the Spirit of God. 1Cor. 12:13. Your bread and wine are just bread and wine; 'mere shadows' (Col. 2:16+17) of the things of the Spirit of God. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral << \"Of {this church} I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the {preaching of} the word of God, {that is,} the mystery which has been hidden from the {past} ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints, to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is CHRIST IN YOU, the hope of glory.? Col. 1:25-27 (CAPS for emphasis).\n \n \n \nMontalban tries to divert attention << Show me where 'steward' appears I did a search at www.biblegateway.com and see that you have no problem here using words that don't exist in the Bible, but the concept does.\n \n \n First, Paul's descriptions of 'this mystery among the Gentiles,' include the words, \"which is \"Christ in you . . .\" Christ is already inside the believer, Montalban. Your Holy Eucharist Communion Ceremonial Ritual places physical idols in the place of the Spirit of God. That is exactly what it means to follow after Idolatry. We can find Vine's Definition for 'steward' here: \n \n http://www.menfak.no/bibelprog/vines?word=\u00aft0002768 \n \n A 'steward' is basically a slave that is placed into a position of authority over the possessions of his master. Vine writes,\n \n \n\"Topic: Steward, Stewardship\n \n <A-1,Noun,3623,oikonomos< \n primarily denoted \"the manager of a household or estate\" (oikos, \"a house,\" nemo, \"to arrange\"), \"a steward\" (such were usually slaves or freedmen), Luke 12:42; 16:1,3,8; 1 Cor. 4:2; Gal. 4:2, RV (AV, \"governors\"); in Rom. 16:23, the \"treasurer\" (RV) of a city (see CHAMBERLAIN, Note); it is used metaphorically, in the wider sense, of a \"steward\" in general, (a) of preachers of the Gospel and teachers of the Word of God, 1 Cor. 4:1; (b) of elders or bishops in churches, Titus 1:7; (c) of believers generally, 1 Pet. 4:10. \n \n <A-2,Noun,2012,epitropos< is rendered \"steward\" in Matt. 20:8; Luke 8:3: see GUARDIAN. \n \n <A-3,Noun,3622,oikonomia< is rendered \"stewardship\" in Luke 16:2,3,4, and in the RV in 1 Cor. 9:17: see DISPENSATION. \n \n <B-1,Verb,3621,oikonomeo< akin to A, Nos. 1 and 3, signifies \"to be a house steward,\" Luke 16:2. In the Sept., Ps. 112:5. \n \n \n Paul writes, \n \n \n\"Let a man regard us in this manner, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.\" 1Cor. 4:1.\n \n \"In this case, moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy.\" 1Cor. 4:2.\n \n \"For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.\" 1Cor. 9:17.\n \n \"if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace which was given to me for you.\" Eph. 3:2.\n \n \"Of {this church} I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the {preaching of} the word of God.\" Col. 1:25. \n \n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral << Note that the ?mystery? aspect, ?has been hidden from the ages and generations.? Does the evidence indicate that the Lord?s Passover supper was hidden from anyone? Does Paul or anyone associate the mystery with any ceremonial ritual anywhere in Scripture? No. Also, how can anyone give me a chunk of Christ, when Paul says that, ?this mystery among the Gentiles, which is CHRIST IN YOU.?? If Christ is already in me, why does anyone need to give Him to me in weekly installments? \n \n \n \nMontalban wisely asks << How does Christ get in you?\n\n \n Terral's reply << First, read these verses again, and apply the 'flesh' aspect to the physical things of your ritual, and the Spirit aspect to the things of the Spirit that they seek to replace:\n \n \n\"And those who are in the flesh cannot please God. However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him. If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.\" Rom. 8:8-11.\n\n \n 'Christ in you' is one aspect of the 'mystery' that comes about through our obedience to the gospel. Let us gain some insight from reading Paul's words to the Colossians again (CAPS for emphasis):\n \n \n\"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of HIS BODY, which is the CHURCH, in filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions. Of {this church} I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the {preaching of} the WORD OF GOD, {that is,} THE MYSTERY which has been hidden from the {past} ages and generations, but has NOW HAS BEEN MANIFESTED to His SANITS [that is all the church members], to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this MYSTERY among the GENTILES, which is CHRIST IN YOU, the hope of glory.\" Col. 1:24-27.\n\n \n Tie the 'Christ in you' precept to the preaching of the 'Word of God,' and specifically to the mystery aspect which has remained hidden, but is now manifested. Where can we find those things all together in Scripture? \"Now to Him who is able to ESTABLISH YOU according to MY GOSPEL and the preaching of Jesus Christ, ACCORDING TO THE REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY which has been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested . . .\" Rom. 16:25+26. Paul tells the Ephesians, \"And {pray} on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the MYSTERY of the GOSPEL.\" Eph. 6:19.\n \n We come to be 'in Christ,' and He comes to be 'Christ in you,' through obedience to the Gospel; pure and simple. I am not talking about the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:17 (23), 9:35, 24:24, Acts 8:12) with those precepts of repentance and water baptism. That is a totally different good news message intended for the 'bride of Christ.' No sir. By adding those precepts to what Paul calls \"my gospel,\" people today are making void the power of the cross. \"For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in cleverness of speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void.\" 1Cor. 1:17. \n \n As you can see, this topic runs over into your 'Sacrament of Holy Baptism,' which is yet another form of Idolatry. We can address those things on the baptism thread I already gave you. Please start your \"Sacrament of Holy Baptism\" in the Doctrine section of this site.

   "Hi Maximus:\n \n \nMaximus << Why do you not celebrate \"communion\" in your church since Jesus said, \"Do this in memory of me?\"\n\n \n Let us first agree that man is capable of taking the words of Scripture out of context and force them to say just about anything. My communion with Christ became a reality through the Gospel (1Cor. 15:1-4) the moment the Spirit of God baptized me into the body. 1Cor. 12:13. I have been 'clothed with Christ' (Gal. 3:27) already. Here are the verses:\n \n \n\"And when He had taken a cup {and} given thanks, He said, \"Take this and share it among yourselves; for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.\" And when He had taken {some} bread {and} given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, \"This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.\" Luke 22:17-19.\n\n \n 1. What is Christ doing? He is fulfilling His legal responsibility to keep the Lord's Passover in one particular month and one particular day, as He had every year all His life. 'In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight is the LORD'S Passover.\" Lev. 23:5. \n \n 2. To whom was Christ speaking? To Jews who were also bound by Mosaic Law to perform the Lord's Passover Supper ritual at twilight on this one day every year. Exodus 12:11, Num. 26:18.\n \n 3. At this time, was Christ sent to everyone on this planet or to one particular people? At this time in Christ's ministry, He was sent ONLY to Israel of the flesh. \"But He answered and said, \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\" Matt. 15:24.\n \n Paul condemns the Corinthian Church for their use of food and drink at their meetings. \n \n \n\"But in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.\" 1Cor. 1:17.\n \n \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20.\n \n \"For in your eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry and another is drunk.\" 1Cor. 11:21.\n \n \"What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you.\" 1Cor. 11:22.\n\n \n \nMaximus << If the Last Supper was another Passover meal then why, in your opinion, did Jesus (The LAMB of God) say, \"This is my body, this is my blood?\"\n\n \n Terral's reply << Every aspect of the Lord's Passover pertains to Jesus Christ and His work on the cross. Remember again that the Lord's Passover Supper Ritual is all about SACRIFICE, and Israel's liberation from Egypt (slavery and death). For the people to live, the Passover lamb had to die. Grain is broken to make the bread. Grapes are crushed for the making of wine. What did Christ say? \"I am the bread of life.\" John 6:48. Therefore, the meat of the Passover lamb was His flesh; the bread was His body, and the wine of that Passover supper was His blood. Christ was telling the disciples that HE was the Passover Lamb. Please go back and read the story, where they had to kill the Passover lamb, put its blood on their doorways. As it is written, \n \n \n\"You shall take a bunch of HYSSOP and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the door of his house until morning. \"For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite {you.}\" Ex. 12:22+23.\n\n \n The door posts (vertical) and the lintel (horizontal) were wooden symbols of the cross. What did Christ say? \"I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.\" John 10:9. When Christ was on the cross, and asked for water, what did they give Him? \"A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon {a branch} {of} HYSSOP and brought it up to His mouth.\" John 10:29. \n \n After the crucifixion, Christ told these same disciples, \"\"These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.\" Luke 24:44. So Christ was explaining these parts of the Lord's Passover Supper to His disciples, in the same way that I am explaining them to you today. \n \n \nMaximus << Why do you think Jesus says in John 6:53 \"Truly, truly, I say to you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.\"\n\n \n Our Lord is speaking figuratively concerning the things of the Spirit. Christ Himself tells you, \"It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.\" John 6:63. Today, we feed upon God's Word in the form of Holy Scripture. Christ said, \"This is the bread which came down out of heaven; not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live forever.\" John 6:58. Then, Paul writes, \"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" Rom. 6:23. As manna was the gift of the Lord God from heaven, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\" Eph. 2:8+9.\n \n \nTerral's Original << If I may add a few notes: My concern with this topic is over that fact that these things represent a form of idolatry. What does Scripture say? \n \n \n \nMaxmius << So Paul was an idolater in his celebration of the Eucharist--\"breaking of bread and drinking of the cup?\"\n\n \n The Apostle Paul did not seek to replace the Spirit of God with his eating and drinking. He did not fabricate a Holy Eucharist Sacrificial Communion Ritual from the Lord's Passover Supper where the Word of God is being replaced with bread and wine. Paul told these fleshy Corinthians, \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20. He never even mentions this to any of the other churches. Instead, Paul says that food and drink are 'mere shadows.' Col. 2:16+17. \n \n We are baptized into one body (1Cor. 12:13) the moment we hear and believe the Gospel. Eph. 1:13+14. This mystery among the Gentiles (\"Christ in you\" Col. 1:27) is about hearing and believing the gospel. Col. 1:24-27, Rom. 16:25. The Church itself is the body of Christ. 1Cor. 12:27, Eph. 5:30, etc.. It is some among us who are practicing idolatry by replacing the things of the Spirit of God with these man-made rituals. Scripture says, \n \n \n\"If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.\" Rom. 8:10+11.\n\n \n These are of the Spirit, Maximus, and Christ does not get into anyone by eating bread and drinking wine during cerimonial rituals. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

As manna was the gift of the Lord God from heaven, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\" Eph. 2:8+9.\n\n If the Lord was speaking figuratively then why do some of his disciples leave because what he taught was a \"hard saying?\" (John 6:60, 6:66) Why did Jesus not draw them back and say, wait you misunderstand me, I am only speaking symbolically about the Spirit? Why is this the only parable where Jesus does not elucidate his figurative language to the apostles?\n \n \nThe Apostle Paul did not seek to replace the Spirit of God with his eating and drinking. He did not fabricate a Holy Eucharist Sacrificial Communion Ritual from the Lord's Passover Supper where the Word of God is being replaced with bread and wine. Paul told these fleshy Corinthians, \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20. He never even mentions this to any of the other churches. Instead, Paul says that food and drink are 'mere shadows.' Col. 2:16+17. \n \n No, Paul did not fabricate anything. Nor has the Church. Paul did not replace the Word with the Eucharist but he did in fact give such strong words about having the right attitude and understanding toward the body and blood that if one takes it lightly then he is condemning himself. It is so important that \"many of you are weak and ill, and some have died\" due to negligence in regard to the Body and Blood. (1 Corinthians 11: 29-30)\n \n Those following Paul carried on this teaching in the early Church:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Real_Presence.asp \n \n \nWe are baptized into one body (1Cor. 12:13) the moment we hear and believe the Gospel. Eph. 1:13+14. This mystery among the Gentiles (\"Christ in you\" Col. 1:27) is about hearing and believing the gospel. Col. 1:24-27, Rom. 16:25. The Church itself is the body of Christ. 1Cor. 12:27, Eph. 5:30, etc.. It is some among us who are practicing idolatry by replacing the things of the Spirit of God with these man-made rituals. Scripture says, \n \n These are of the Spirit, Maximus, and Christ does not get into anyone by eating bread and drinking wine during cerimonial rituals. \n \n We are baptized into one body, no one argues that. But that is not to say that there are not more than one images and fulfillments of the Body of Christ. There are often several deep meanings and layers of scripture. Abundant examples of that can be demonstrated (just as this is demonstrated with the Church as the Bride of Christ). If we are baptized into one body we are also joined in one body by partaking of the Eucharist. Paul explicitly tells us this:\n \n 1 Corinthians 10:16-17  \"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.\"\n \n I do not understand why the Eucharist of the Church is idolatry being that it is worship of Jesus Christ. Can you explain that to me? How is worship of Jesus Christ and following his command to \"do this in remembrance of me\" idolatry? \n \n Furthermore, you have yet to explain why Paul himself is not an idolater when Paul makes it clear that he believes the breaking of the bread and drinking of the cup, when commemorated properly, to be the actual body and blood of Jesus (1 Corinthians 10:16-17, 1 Corinthians 11:23-32)\n \n I am also still interested to know why Paul celebrates the Eucharist being that he quit administering the Kingdom Gospel and began administering the Gospel of Grace. Why does he partake of a Kingdom Covenant and why does he teach his Gentile churches to do so?",

   "\n Greetings to Montalban and All:\n My point is to demonstrate where the key words in this discussion appear in the Text, and where they do not. You are comparing apples to oranges here. The trinity is found throughout Scripture. \"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.? Matt. 28:19. \n\n No, the 'concept' of the Trinity is in the Scripture. We only know that when it says \"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\" it refers to a unit of co-equal parts - the Trinity - based on the teachings of the Church. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as mentioned in the Bible could, and is, interpreted to mean other things; such as the JWs believing that there's God, and that there's a lesser 'god' Son, and the Holy Spirit is the unconscious power of God.\n There is nothing there to suggest by itself the doctrine of the Trinity. Arians, Nestorians etc all used the same verses. It is the teachings of the Church that explain how we interpret the words... you just happen to agree with the interpretation, in this case. You disagree in regards the Eucharist.\n That's not a true analogy. You are comparing the 'word' Eucharist, and reject it, when Jesus quite clearly said \"This is My Body\" and \"This is the New Covenant\"; yet the word Trinity likewise does not appear, but I agree, the concept does.\n \nIn each case, the key words, and proof of the Three Witnesses of our God, appear as nouns or pronouns. Those key words are not nouns derived from adjectives and verbs, as in your Holy Eucharist case. No sir, your Holy Eucharist is a man-made invention that has turned ?thanks? into a ritual of idolatry. Your word ?Eucharist? is not even a translation into English, but a forged human attempt at reworking the actual Greek in the original form (Eucharisteo into Eucharist). \n\n Trinity is not in the English Bible. Show me where it is. The rule you apply won't work. The \"Three Witnesses\" could very well fit the Nestorian doctrine just as easily.\n \nI can take the words ?Father, Son and Holy Spirit? (from Matthew 28:19) and make a reasonable case for the Trinity doctrine from the original Greek. I cannot do the same thing with the two verb references to ?eucharisteo? in the Gospel of Matthew; especially when the noun form is not even used in any of the Four Gospel accounts. All of these points work together to prove beyond doubt that this Holy Eucharist Communion Ceremonial Ritualistic offering of Christ?s body over and over and over again is NOT based upon one thing written in our Bibles. My ?case? is not based upon the single verse of Scripture, as you suggested to everyone in our recent discussion, where Paul says, ?Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.? 1Cor. 11:20.\n\n This actually has some sense to it... though it's rather a convoluted theory again based on the origins of the word Eucharist. The word \"Trinity\" denoted a particular relationship between the three partners, it is not enough to say that because there are three names mentioned they are \"Trinity\".\n \nThe word used in Matthew, Mark and Luke, where Christ gives ?thanks? at the Lord?s Passover meal is the verb eucharisteo (Matt. 26:27, Mark 14:23, Luke 22:19). Note that Christ uses the same word in a previous example in each of these Gospel accounts. ?And He took the seven loaves and the fish; and giving THANKS, He broke them. . .? \n\n \nFurther to that He said \"This is the New Covenant\", plus the command \"Do this in memory of me\" \n\n \nFirst, why quote me if there is no intention of meeting the objection raised in my point?\n\n I missed that one. My apologies.\n You miss the point where Jesus, although giving thanks as He did many times, He is creating a new covenant that supersedes Passover, and when He says \"This is my Body\" there is no doubt about this. He's not saying \"This is like My Body\" as stated in Post #1\n St Matt. 26:26; St Mark. 14:22; St Luke 22:19-20 - the Greek phrase is \"Touto estin to soma mou.\" This phraseology means \"this is actually\" or \"this is really\" my body and blood.\n \n The Scriptural evidence shows that Christ used this same ?eucharisteo? word in giving ?thanks? to God in the examples above. Was Christ performing your Eucharist ritual with these seven loaves and fish? Why the inconsistency here? After all, Christ only used the ?eucharisteo? word twice in the entire account. Why then are you not just as eager to prove Christ was instituting a Holy Eucharist Ceremonial Ritual in Matthew 15:36? Hey! Seven loaves for Seven Sacraments. Maybe we are on to something . . . Not. Do these facts appear to prove, or disprove, the validity of the Holy Eucharist doctrine? The third party reader can decide. \n\n Because as stated above He says \"This is My Body\"\n \nTo address your point on the New Covenant: Christ?s words concerning the New Covenant represent His intentions to fulfil of the Lord?s Passover (He would do that, however, on the cross). These words to the disciples represent no small event indeed, as it pertains to the ?bride of Christ.? Remember that Christ spoke those words to Jews only, as He was performing the Lord?s Passover supper ritual. That is the proper context in which these things were done. And, He did these things prior to revealing ?our gospel? to Paul (Gal. 1:11+12). It is one thing to be part of a New Covenant with the Lord, and quite another to be baptized into His body (Rom. 6:3+4, 1Cor. 12:13). \n\n Then you interpret His words figuratively when it says \"This is My Body\"\n Further to that, I have no idea what relevance Gal 1 is to your case, nor for that matter Rom 6. If you are Baptised into Christ, are you saying that you don't sin?\n \nWhat is a covenant, but a promise to do something in the future? Christ?s words at the Last Supper are pointing to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb (Rev. 19:5-10). \n\n A covenant is a contract. Christ says \"Take eat this is My Body\". He is enjoining us to take a part of Him. If it was a metaphor, then He'd have said \"Take this Bread, for it is alike unto my Body\" Jesus is giving us Himself.\n \nRemember again that Peter and the Twelve are called the ?servants (sons/groomsmen) of the bridal chamber.? Mark 2:19.\n\n You keep losing me by throwing in a Bible quote as if it is of itself a retort. I have no idea of a connection\n \nAnd, let us not forget the words of John the Baptist, which apply here, \n \"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine has been made full.? John 3:29. \n\n Ditto\n I apologise leaving your post at this point due to time constraints",

We only know that when it says \"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\" it refers to a unit of co-equal parts - the Trinity - based on the teachings of the Church. \n \n \n No sir, this is not about the founding fathers of your church at all. Nor is this about you and me. It is about whether the Greek supports or does not support the existence of your Holy Eucharist. The Father, Son and Holy Spirit are not concepts that we only know about from the teachers of your church dogma. Your Holy Eucharist is the concept that they invented from the one use of a single verb in Matthew 26:27 (. . . a cup and given THANkS, Verb, 2168, eucharisteo). Their precepts of doctrine are stolen from the Lord's Passover Supper, which Christ performed according to Mosaic Law.\n \n \nMontalban << The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as mentioned in the Bible could, and is, interpreted to mean other things; such as the JWs believing that there's God, and that there's a lesser 'god' Son, and the Holy Spirit is the unconscious power of God.\n\n \n That would be more contrary to Scripture than the doctrine of your Holy Eucharist. What did Christ say? \"I and the Father are one.\" John 10:30. We know that the Holy Spirit speaks to prophets, \"This is what the Holy Spirit says: 'In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.\" Acts 21:11. And lastly, the Three Witnesses are equal, because They 'are into the One.\" 1John 5:8. \n \n \nMontalban << There is nothing there to suggest by itself the doctrine of the Trinity. \n \n \n Am I writing to the wall? How many verses of Holy Text is required, before you can type out that there is 'something' there to suggest the triune nature of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit? I gave you quotes from Genesis 1 to 1John and many in between, and could give you a ten page post on descriptions of all the evidence. I cannot do the same for your Holy Eucharist Communion Ritual. As already presented, The Son of God was performing the Last Lord's Passover Supper Ritual before the Crucifixion, according to Mosaic Law. The Holy Eucharist mumbo jumbo is NOT part of the Text. Every single thing Christ said and did was the fulfillment of OT Prophecy. \n \n \nMontalban << Arians, Nestorians etc all used the same verses. It is the teachings of the Church that explain how we interpret the words... you just happen to agree with the interpretation, in this case.

You are comparing the 'word' Eucharist, and reject it, when Jesus quite clearly said \"This is My Body\" and \"This is the New Covenant\"; \n \n \n That's right. This part of our discussion is over the use of the terms. The noun form of your Eucharist 'word' is not even used in any of the Four Gospel accounts; only the verb. And you have the gall to draw these kinds of comparisons? You speak as if only the word 'fathering' was used twice in the Gospel of Matthew, and I turned that around to prove the existence of our Father. Who on earth could possibly be persuaded by such a flimsy argument? If you really and truly believe this argument proves anything, then perhaps the deluding influence (2Thes. 2:10-12) simply has too much power over you. \n \n \nMontalban << the word Trinity likewise does not appear, but I agree, the concept does.\n \n \n You are still comparing apples to oranges here.

I am willing to allow my previous arguments on this thread to speak to this (term) aspect of the discussion.\n \n \nMontalban << You miss the point where Jesus, although giving thanks as He did many times, He is creating a new covenant that supersedes Passover, and when He says \"This is my Body\" there is no doubt about this.\n\n \n Supersedes the Passover? \"This\" wine represented \"the blood\" that poured from His body on the cross. Christ Himself was the 'bread of life' (John 6:48) that was broken for us at Calvary. What did He say at the very end of His suffering for our sins, just after the world gave Him sour wine? \" It is finished! \" John 19:30. Paul writes these same Corinthians and says, \"Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are {in fact} unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.\" 1Cor. 5:7. Instead, you continue to sacrifice Him over and over again, as if \"It is not finished;\" as if our Passover has not been sacrificed. And as if, Christ giving His disciples lessons about the Spirit of God, during the Passover ritual, gives your church the right to invent the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist Communion Sacrificial Offering Ceremony, as if mere men are qualified to hand out pieces of Christ Jesus. \n \n \nMontalban << He's not saying \"This is like My Body\" as stated in Post #1 St Matt. 26:26; St Mark. 14:22; St Luke 22:19-20 - the Greek phrase is \"Touto estin to soma mou.\" This phraseology means \"this is actually\" or \"this is really\" my body and blood.\n\n \n We have been over that point, and you invented and added that \"really\" garb to the translation.

Let's break my statements down into edible chunks, they way your priest breaks his bread. \n \n \nTerral From Original Above << Christ's words concerning the New Covenant represent His intentions to fulfill the Lord's Passover (He would do that, however, on the cross).\n\n \n Very simply: Christ did not pay for any sin at the Last Supper. His blood had yet to be spilled. Everything Christ did at His Last Passover Supper was a symbol (representation) of Mosaic Law, OT Prophecy and what He was about to do at Calvary. \" Now He said to them, \n \n \n\"These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.'\" Luke 24:44.\n \n \n How can I say this again without repeating myself over and over? \n \n \nTerral From Original Above << \"These words to the disciples represent no small event indeed, as it pertains to the \"bride of Christ.\" Remember that Christ spoke those words to Jews only, as He was performing the Lord's Passover supper ritual. That is the proper context in which these things were done.\"\n\n \n In other words, Christ was not telling Peter and the Twelve everything. He was giving them instruction on how 'these things' applied to the 'bride of Christ.' Peter and the Twelve teach Kingdom Doctrine to the members of the Jewish 'bride of Christ.' That is why he was still going to the 'circumcised' in Gal. 2:9, some two decades later. \n \n Think about it. After Christ had died for sins, and redemption through His blood could now be preached as the 'gospel,' why did Christ continue to command that they baptize in water? Mark 16:15+16? Why did Peter continue to preach the same thing as John the Baptist (Matt. 3:1-6, Mark 1:4) to repent and be baptized \"for the forgiveness of your sins.\" Acts 2:38? The answer is that the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 24:14) was still in full force to Israel of the flesh (His future bride). \n \n Christ's teachings to the Twelve were given, as if Paul would never be raised up and given 'our gospel' for today. This 'dispensation of God's grace' (Eph. 3:2) is parenthetical to the Kingdom Administration. When their kingdom is restored with their temple (Acts 15:16-18), they will continue to make the animal sacrifices throughout the coming Kingdom Dispensation. Messianic Israel represents the \"Royal Priesthood\" (1Pet. 2:9) who must A.P.P.L.Y His blood during 'their' sacrificial rituals done according to Mosaic Law. Paul tells us of these things here, and he answers your question which pertains to this covenant (CAPS are OT quotes):\n \n \nFor I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery--so that you will not be wise in your own estimation--that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in; and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, \"THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB.\" THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.\" Rom. 11:25-27.\n\n \n So this 'covenant' with Israel of the flesh remains as the promise of our Lord concerning His future plans for them. It is only at the very end of the coming Kingdom Dispensation that the antichrist appears to fulfill these things: \n \n \n\"Forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice. And they will set up the abomination of desolation.\" Dan. 11:31.\n \n \"From the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up, {there will be} 1,290 days.\" Dan. 12:11.\n\n \n Their regular sacrifices must be established again, for them to be abolished near the end, when he comes. So Christ's teachings to the Twelve about the Lord's Passover Supper, and everything else, explains how OT Prophecy and Mosaic Law would be clothed 'fulfilled' in the future. Again, this body of teaching is totally separate from the 'Mystery' taught from within the Pauline Epistles. This led me to say . . . \n \n \nTerral From Original Above << And, He did these things prior to revealing \"our gospel\" to Paul (Gal. 1:11+12). \n \n \n These things being taught by Christ to the Twelve manifest themselves to the us Gentiles in very different ways. Again, Israel is Peter's 'bride of Christ,' and we are Paul's 'body of Christ.' Nobody knew anything about this Gentile 'body of Christ,' until Paul came along and described it to them. Our Lord Jesus Christ raised Paul up and gave Him our gospel for today. \n \n \n\"For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but {I received it} through a revelation of Jesus Christ.\" Gal. 1:11+12.\n\n \n Christ also sent Paul down to Jerusalem to submit \"the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles\" (Gal. 2:2) to Peter, John and James. He did so, \"in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.\" Paul even goes so far as to say of Peter, John and James, \n \n \n\"But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you. But from those who were of high reputation (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)--well, those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me.\" Gal. 2:5+6. \n \n \n It is through Paul's gospel that we preach redemption in Christ's shed blood (Eph. 1:7, Col. 1:20). Peter and the members of the bride of Christ did not even have a clue about this, until Paul came down and showed them. Did Peter find this wisdom easy to fathom? Or most difficult? Let us ask him. About two decades later, Peter wrote, \n \n \n\"Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless, and regard the patience of our Lord {as} salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the WISDOM GIVEN HIM, wrote to you, as also in all {his} letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things HARD TO UNDERSTAND, which the untaught and unstable distort, as {they do} also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.\" 2Pet. 3:14-16.\n\n \n Remember again that Paul warns these same Corinthians, \"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.\" 2Cor. 4:3+4.\n \n Do you see Peter's warning about distorting this wisdom given Paul and 'destruction?' And Paul's warnings about 'our gospel' being veiled? Guess what, Montalban . . . ? You want to start your church back in the Four Gospels, where Christ is addressing the bride? Do you want to teach a Holy Sacrament of Water Baptism based upon Peter's words in Acts 2? And then you want to question me about how Christ's revelation of 'our gospel' to Paul has application to this case? You do not see it, Montalban, and I know you do not . . . for certain. That is why you questioned me about Paul's stewardship. There is a vast body of knowledge contained in the Pauline Epistles that all your religious ritualistic idolatry has blinded you to; not just you, but many reading these words. \n \n \nTerral From Original Above (Last Chunk) << It is one thing to be part of a New Covenant with the Lord, and quite another to be baptized into His body (Rom. 6:3+4, 1Cor. 12:13).\n\n \n As already stated, a 'covenant' is a promise to do something in the future. Everything Christ is doing in Matthew 26 points to the Lord betrothing Israel to Himself for a future marriage, at the marriage supper of the Lamb. Rev. 19:20. Even when Elijah comes to restore the hearts of the fathers, he will be preparing Israel as a nation for their marriage to our Lord. What did Christ tell the Disciples in Matthew 26? \"But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom.\" Matt. 26:29. That is when the provisions of the new covenant shall be fulfilled. But again, THAT body of KINGDOM doctrine pertains to the 'bride of Christ.' By hearing and believing 'our gospel,' which is Paul's gospel (Rom. 2:16, 16:25, etc), then we are clothed with Christ (Gal. 3:27) already. And thus Paul tells these same Corinthians, \n \n \n\"For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.\" 1Cor. 12:13.\n \n \"Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have become united with {Him} in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be {in the likeness} of His resurrection.\" Rom. 6:3-5.\n\n \n These are words about our 'spiritual' baptism (one baptism; Eph. 4:5) into Christ on the cross at Calvary, and NOT to His experience in the Jordan River. Nothing about our spiritual union with Christ has anything to do with water. This is about being joined to Him, when He died on the cross and was placed into the tomb, and about being raised with Him (in Him) when God raised Him from the dead. That, my friend, is the power of Paul's gospel. Rom. 1:16+17. Since that is our 'one baptism,' then there is no room for your Holy Sacrament of Water Baptism ritual. That would become a second baptism done by human hands, and a work. \n \n Our justification is by faith apart from works. Rom. 4:5. We are saved by God's grace through faith apart from works! Eph: 2:8+9. So the members of the 'body of Christ,' have already been baptized into the Covenant Maker. We seek no future marriage supper of the Lamb, because we have been baptized into the Lamb already. That is why the Holy Spirit is calling Christ the \"Lamb\" during that marriage ritual (Rev. 19:5-10) in the first place! Our lives are already hidden in the same place where God hid His mystery. Your mind is set on the things of this earth with the mere shadows of bread rituals and cups of wine. Paul tells us,\n \n \n\"Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ IN GOD. When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.\" Col. 3:1-4.\n\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral << What is a covenant, but a promise to do something in the future? Christ's words at the Last Supper are pointing to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb (Rev. 19:5-10).\n \n \n \nMontalban << A covenant is a contract. Christ says \"Take eat this is My Body\". He is enjoining us to take a part of Him. If it was a metaphor, then He'd have said \"Take this Bread, for it is alike unto my Body\" Jesus is giving us Himself. \n \n \n No, He gave Himself up for us already, on the cross. Paul's gospel represents God's call to us for obedience of faith (Rom. 16:26) right now and today. \" Behold, now is \"THE DAY OF SALVATION.\" 2Cor. 6:2. His date with Israel is still future.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral << Remember again that Peter and the Twelve are called the 'servants (sons/groomsmen) of the bridal chamber.' Mark 2:19.\n \n \n \nMontalban << You keep losing me by throwing in a Bible quote as if it is of itself a retort. I have no idea of a connection \n \n \n As if my reply is an angry comeback gesture? God bless you Montalban. The only way you will extract this particular truth from the Greek is to go there and study it for yourself. I can lead you to the water, but the desire to drink must come from within you. \n \n These members of the bride of Christ shall sit and judge on thrones over Israel (Luke 22:30). The body of Christ shall judge the world (1Cor. 6:2) and the angels (1Cor.6:3). Can you see the difference in those principals? The Lord God has given me to write this way to All, so that as the body grows in Christ these writings shall continue to feed and edify. Sometimes things are repeated again and again, but some nails require more effort to drive than others. I can assure you that each point is carefully chosen to address the need at hand, as if seeds are filling the void. Let us not expect to see the harvest in one day. \n \n If 'these things' (2Pet. 3:14 +16) were easy to understand, then the world would not have over 2000 denominations of professing Christians. However, there is 'one truth,' and one correct way to interpret God's Living Word. Once you come to 'see' it for yourself, then nobody can take that gift away. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "So, based on b-e, you can't listen to someone disagree with you on a point of theology without feeling not only personally attacked, but also feeling that your entire faith is under attack? That's sad, but I won't distress you any further. I'll keep my ideas to myself, if exposure to them causes you such pain.\n\n Not at all, I have no problem arguing with Terral about this because he's not posting anti-Christian web-sites that he thinks might undermine transubstantiation, and then running with it for a few days to see what pans out in the hope of scoring some point or two. It is very typical of you that you only argue with me when you think you can do this, hence the fact you'd ignore direct questions I'd put to you on other posts and continue to instead debate Jim'sTrucking or someone else.

   "Greetings to Montalban and All:\n My point is to demonstrate where the key words in this discussion appear in the Text, and where they do not. You are comparing apples to oranges here. The trinity is found throughout Scripture. \"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.? Matt. 28:19.\n\n \nNo, the 'concept' of the Trinity is in the Scripture. We only know that when it says \"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\" it refers to a unit of co-equal parts - the Trinity - based on the teachings of the Church. \n\n \nNo sir, this is not about the founding fathers of your church at all.\n\n Yes, in part it is. I belong to the Church that keeps the practices of the Apostles. I have endeavoured to show also from non-Biblical evidence that the early Church practiced the Eucharist - hence it's in the Didache - which pre-dates the Bible and also, from pagan critiques of those early Christians. About 1,500 years after doing this, people similar to Luther decided to throw out the central Sacrament of Christianity... one that was posted from day 1.\n \nNor is this about you and me. It is about whether the Greek supports or does not support the existence of your Holy Eucharist. The Father, Son and Holy Spirit are not concepts that we only know about from the teachers of your church dogma. Your Holy Eucharist is the concept that they invented from the one use of a single verb in Matthew 26:27 (. . . a cup and given THANkS, Verb, 2168, eucharisteo). Their precepts of doctrine are stolen from the Lord?s Passover Supper, which Christ performed according to Mosaic Law.\n\n That's simply not true. The Doctrine of the Trinity is spelled-out in Church Council, the substance of the teaching IS found in the Bible, yes. But, if you were to rely wholly on the Bible for a doctrine of the relationship between Father, Son and Holy Spirit, you could equally support JW doctrine, Nestorianism, Arianism, etc. Or even a whole host of dualist notions.\n \nThe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as mentioned in the Bible could, and is, interpreted to mean other things; such as the JWs believing that there's God, and that there's a lesser 'god' Son, and the Holy Spirit is the unconscious power of God.\n\n \nThat would be more contrary to Scripture than the doctrine of your Holy Eucharist. What did Christ say? ?I and the Father are one.\" John 10:30. We know that the Holy Spirit speaks to prophets, \"This is what the Holy Spirit says: 'In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.? Acts 21:11. And lastly, the Three Witnesses are equal, because They ?are into the One.? 1John 5:8.\n\n Yes but what does \"One\" mean, because we too can be 'one' with God. How that 'oneness' is was determined in the context of Holy Tradition which preceded the Bible. The Bible, if you like, merely in a point form lays out a lot of concepts, Eucharist, Trinity, etc. Those putting the Bible together didn't need to spell out either, because they already believed it them.\n The idea of the Eucharist is found in Jesus' commands to \"Do this in memory of me\". It is shown by Acts where the Apostles got together in memory of Him, and in other works, such as the Didache, and also St.Paul points out in 1 Cor 11 that when you come together you must think of it as the Body and Blood of Christ. It isn't spelled out anymore or less than the Trinity, because that's not the purpose of the Bible. If the New Testament was meant to be like that, we'd have all the laws and that like in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers all in fine detail.\n \nThere is nothing there to suggest by itself the doctrine of the Trinity.\n\n \nAm I writing to the wall? How many verses of Holy Text is required, before you can type out that there is ?something? there to suggest the triune nature of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit? I gave you quotes from Genesis 1 to 1John and many in between, and could give you a ten page post on descriptions of all the evidence. I cannot do the same for your Holy Eucharist Communion Ritual. As already presented, The Son of God was performing the Last Lord?s Passover Supper Ritual before the Crucifixion, according to Mosaic Law. The Holy Eucharist mumbo jumbo is NOT part of the Text. Every single thing Christ said and did was the fulfilment of OT Prophecy. \n\n \"In Scripture there is as yet no single term by which the Three Divine Persons are denoted together\"\n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15047a.htm\n I believe the Trinity is 'based' on the Bible. So is the Eucharist. Neither of them are outrightly supported by the Bible, because the Bible's purpose is not to elaborate Christian dogma. But, you just stating that the Bible texts prove the Trinity is all well and good, but the actual concept of, and the relationship of the Trinity is a special one.\n \nArians, Nestorians etc all used the same verses. It is the teachings of the Church that explain how we interpret the words... you just happen to agree with the interpretation, in this case. You disagree in regards the Eucharist.\n\n \nIt does not matter if they take these pages and make paper airplanes. Arians indeed . . . \n\n Sure, Arius tried to defy Holy Tradition, by an attempt to show that the relationship of the Persons of the Trinity were not equal.\n \"... the Arian controversy broke out, which led to a series of doctrinal disputes. The argument involved the nature and being of the Logos in becoming man in Christ and then the relationship of the Logos to the Father. Of necessity, the Holy Spirit was dragged into the dispute, as Arius, who had started the argument, described the Holy Spirit as the first creature produced by the Son (Kurtz, I, 316?318, 323). Arius, who was a presbyter at Alexandria, disputed the teaching of his superior, Alexander. Arius advocated three persons in God, but held they were not equal in glory. The Father was supreme, while the Son was given His divinity by the Father before the Creation of the world. The Holy Spirit was also divine but inferior to the Father. This controversy led to the Nicene Council of AD 325, which adopted what is regarded as the orthodox standard. Those who opposed the orthodox view correctly forecast that tritheism (three gods) would be the inevitable consequence. It took three more centuries, however, to decide anything about the Holy Spirit. The Trinity is now described by modern theologians as divine powers, or attributes, rather than three Persons. And even today theologians are unable to conclude in what manner or what sense the three attributes or powers have divine nature in common, so that there is only one God ( McClintock and Strong, s.v. \"Trinity\").\"\n http://www.bethelcog.org/CG_TrinityNature.html\n The Trinity is not just a doctrine of Oneness, it's also of their natures in the relationship. I can be at one with a wife, but that doesn't mean that I have her will.\n \n That's not a true analogy. You are comparing the 'word' Eucharist, and reject it, when Jesus quite clearly said \"This is My Body\" and \"This is the New Covenant\"; \n\n \nThat?s right. This part of our discussion is over the use of the terms. The noun form of your Eucharist ?word? is not even used in any of the Four Gospel accounts; only the verb. And you have the gall to draw these kinds of comparisons? You speak as if only the word ?fathering? was used twice in the Gospel of Matthew, and I turned that around to prove the existence of our Father. Who on earth could possibly be persuaded by such a flimsy argument? If you really and truly believe this argument proves anything, then perhaps the deluding influence (2Thes. 2:10-12) simply has too much power over you. \n\n SO, when Jesus says \"This IS My Body\" you think it is not true, what He is saying. You make a convoluted attempt to debunk the Eucharist because the word isn't found there, yet even though the Trinity isn't either, you try to use the words that ARE there - in this case 'One'.\n \nthe word Trinity likewise does not appear, but I agree, the concept does.\n\n \nYou are still comparing apples to oranges here. The only part where we agree is when you wrote, ?That?s not a true analogy.? \n\n No. You have one rule, and you apply it differently. Both words aren't found there. Instead you try to prove the Trinity by the words that ARE there - e.g. 'One' and I do the same with regards the Trinity - and you call mine a 'flimsy argument' then make an oblique insult re: 2 Thes.\n \nIn each case, the key words, and proof of the Three Witnesses of our God, appear as nouns or pronouns. Those key words are not nouns derived from adjectives and verbs, as in your Holy Eucharist case. No sir, your Holy Eucharist is a man-made invention that has turned ?thanks? into a ritual of idolatry. Your word ?Eucharist? is not even a translation into English, but a forged human attempt at reworking the actual Greek in the original form (Eucharisteo into Eucharist).\n\n There are many peoples in the Bible.\n \nTrinity is not in the English Bible. Show me where it is. The rule you apply won't work. The \"Three Witnesses\" could very well fit the Nestorian doctrine just as easily.\n\n \nBut all the precepts do appear throughout Scripture. And you can keep your word ?Trinity.? As Paul says, \n ?For this reason I bow my knees before the Father.? Eph. 3:14. And, ?The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.? 2Cor. 13:14. \n\n So? Show me how this proves the equality of the Trinity!\n \nAdd these things to, ?Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper? (1Cor. 11:20), and your whole case goes right out the window. I am willing to allow my previous arguments on this thread to speak to this (term) aspect of the discussion.\n\n I feel like I'm talking to the brick wall now... St.Paul does say that, that's because the Eucharist is not just a meal -see v.29 St.Paul says you must think of it as the Body and Blood of Christ. That you ignore the rest of St.Paul means your case could be strong - but only by such selective use of the passages that you have to rely on one verse only out of context\n \n You miss the point where Jesus, although giving thanks as He did many times, He is creating a new covenant that supersedes Passover, and when He says \"This is my Body\" there is no doubt about this.\n\n \nSupersedes the Passover? ?This? wine represented ?the blood? that poured from His body on the cross. Christ Himself was the 'bread of life? (John 6:48) that was broken for us at Calvary. What did He say at the very end of His suffering for our sins, just after the world gave Him sour wine? \" It is finished! \" John 19:30. Paul writes these same Corinthians and says, ?Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are {in fact} unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.? 1Cor. 5:7. Instead, you continue to sacrifice Him over and over again, as if ?It is not finished;? as if our Passover has not been sacrificed. And as if, Christ giving His disciples lessons about the Spirit of God, during the Passover ritual, gives your church the right to invent the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist Communion Sacrificial Offering Ceremony, as if mere men are qualified to hand out pieces of Christ Jesus. \n\n SO? Christ is the bread of Life, we partake of this bread of life during the Eucharist. You simply offer me more evidence that proves my point. Jesus said \"This (bread) IS My Body\", of the New Covenant. Take this and Eat it. Eat of My Body.\n \n\"This is like My Body\" as stated in Post #1 St Matt. 26:26; St Mark. 14:22; St Luke 22:19-20 - the Greek phrase is \"Touto estin to soma mou.\" This phraseology means \"this is actually\" or \"this is really\" my body and blood.\n\n \nWe have been over that point, and you invented and added that ?really? garb to the translation. Saying the tooth fairy exists a thousand times does not make it so.\n\n Not at all. I didn't add \"really I'm pointing out the meaning of 'is'. Christ says This IS my Body. For your argument to work, He should have said \"This is like My Body\" You simply re-invent the word is to mean like\n \nTo address your point on the New Covenant: Christ?s words concerning the New Covenant represent His intentions to fulfil the Lord?s Passover (He would do that, however, on the cross). These words to the disciples represent no small event indeed, as it pertains to the ?bride of Christ.? Remember that Christ spoke those words to Jews only, as He was performing the Lord?s Passover supper ritual.\n\n The Last Supper was the transition. It was the final Passover meal for the Disciples, because they were about to embark upon the world as Christians.\n \nThat is the proper context in which these things were done. And, He did these things prior to revealing ?our gospel? to Paul (Gal. 1:11+12). It is one thing to be part of a New Covenant with the Lord, and quite another to be baptized into His body (Rom. 6:3+4, 1Cor. 12:13). \n\n It is totally superfluous that it's prior to revealing the Gospel to St. Paul because it's done before revealing the Gospel before millions of other people too. I don't know why you place St.Paul in some kind of key role here. You've yet to explain why anything revealed before St.Paul's conversion is lessened by the fact that St.Paul didn't know about it.\n \nFurther to that, I have no idea what relevance Gal 1 is to your case, nor for that matter Rom 6. If you are Baptised into Christ, are you saying that you don't sin? \n\n \nDo the words ?you do not sin? appear anywhere in my post? No. Where are you trying to lead the third party reader? Let?s break my statements down into edible chunks, they way your priest breaks his bread. \n\n No, I want to know why you introduce a passage that I don't see any point to - in the context of this debate.\n \nChrist?s words concerning the New Covenant represent His intentions to fulfil the Lord?s Passover (He would do that, however, on the cross).\n\n I still don't see the connection\n \nVery simply: Christ did not pay for any sin at the Last Supper.\n\n That's a different idea from mine - Christ 'paying' for our sins with His death.\n \nHis blood had yet to be spilled. Everything Christ did at His Last Passover Supper was a symbol (representation) of Mosaic Law, OT Prophecy and what He was about to do at Calvary. ? Now He said to them, \n \"These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.?\" Luke 24:44. \n How can I say this again without repeating myself over and over? \n\n Seriously, I've no idea how this negates Jesus' own words when He says \"This is My Body\"\n \n?These words to the disciples represent no small event indeed, as it pertains to the ?bride of Christ.? Remember that Christ spoke those words to Jews only, as He was performing the Lord?s Passover supper ritual. That is the proper context in which these things were done.? \n\n That's right, before St.Paul was converted - why that's important to this I don't know. But hey, I'll just go along.\n \nIn other words, Christ was not telling Peter and the Twelve everything. He was giving them instruction on how ?these things? applied to the ?bride of Christ.? Peter and the Twelve teach Kingdom Doctrine to the members of the Jewish ?bride of Christ.? That is why he was still going to the ?circumcised? in Gal. 2:9, some two decades later.\n\n So somehow St.Paul received Christ's final revelations? \n \nThink about it. After Christ had died for sins, and redemption through His blood could now be preached as the ?gospel,? why did Christ continue to command that they baptize in water? Mark 16:15+16? Why did Peter continue to preach the same thing as John the Baptist (Matt. 3:1-6, Mark 1:4) to repent and be baptized ?for the forgiveness of your sins.? Acts 2:38? The answer is that the ?gospel of the kingdom? (Matt. 24:14) was still in full force to Israel of the flesh (His future bride).\n\n We baptise in Water as a re-birth. In Orthodoxy you are fully submerged in the water. It is a parallel to your own physical birth. From Spiritual birth and physical birth we begin our path back to God.\n This concept of Israel law continuing on after elevates St.Paul way to high.\n \nChrist?s teachings to the Twelve were given, as if Paul would never be raised up and given ?our gospel? for today. This ?dispensation of God?s grace? (Eph. 3:2) is parenthetical to the Kingdom Administration. When their kingdom is restored with their temple (Acts 15:16-18), they will continue to make the animal sacrifices throughout the coming Kingdom Dispensation. Messianic Israel represents the ?Royal Priesthood? (1Pet. 2:9) who must A.P.P.L.Y His blood during ?their? sacrificial rituals done according to Mosaic Law. Paul tells us of these things here, and he answers your question which pertains to this covenant (CAPS are OT quotes):\n Quote:\n For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery--so that you will not be wise in your own estimation--that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in; and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, \"THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB.\" THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.\" Rom. 11:25-27. \n So this ?covenant? with Israel of the flesh remains as the promise of our Lord concerning His future plans for them. It is only at the very end of the coming Kingdom Dispensation that the antichrist appears to fulfil these things:\n\n I will have to go and think about this novel doctrine of yours. I never knew that Jesus foretold of someone who'd come after Him to complete His teachings. I'll get back to you on that.",

   "Terral,\n \n Forgive me because I am new here. But am I to understand from your reading that you are a former Roman Catholic who has since renounced Catholicism...or rather joined a Church whose authority is Sola Scriptura?\n \n If that is the case...can you please tell me where in the Bible it states one only needs the Bible to understand and appreciate God's message?\n \n Also...Why do \"Bible-based\" Churches see fit to ignore Apostolic Traditions in the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches...but have no problem basing their Church on the Holy Bible -- which is also a product of the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches -- mostly Orthodox? \n \n A side note: If one were to follow the exact practices of Christ and the Apostles one would be following Jewish practices. But Christians are different from Jews. Traditionally the Christian Sabbath is on Sunday rather than Saturday because that is the day Christ was risen from the tomb. (It is also corresponded with the worship day of the pagan sun worshippers in the time of Emperor Constantine which made it convenient from a governing standpoint). It is also worth noting that quite differently from the Roman Catholic Church, in the Orthodox Church, Holy Communion is not served at every service, every day. It is reserved only for Divine Liturgy -- and that is not a daily occurance like the Catholic Mass.\n \n ALSO...Monty....It can reasonably be argued that baptism is the oldest Christian ritual -- not the Lord's Supper.",

   "ALSO...Monty....It can reasonably be argued that baptism is the oldest Christian ritual -- not the Lord's Supper.\n\n \n I have re-read my sources and not trying to split hairs, I must re-word what I said to state that the Eucharist is the oldest sacrament that's uniquely Christian...\n \n \"The Holy Eucharist is the oldest experience of Christian Worship as well as the most distinctive. Eucharist comes from the Greek word which means ?thanksgiving.? In a particular sense, the word describes the most important form of the Church?s attitude toward all of life. The origin of the Eucharist is traced to the Last Supper at which Christ instructed His disciples to offer bread and wine in His memory. The Eucharist is the most distinctive event of Orthodox worship because in it the Church gathers to remember and celebrate the Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ and, thereby, to participate in the mystery of Salvation.\"\n http://www.aggreen.net/eucharist/eucharist.html\n \n That is, because although Baptism happened earlier, it was not unique to Christianity - having been practiced by Jews such as John the Forebearer (the Baptist)\n \n Oddly enough another Orthodox site seems at first at first glance, to contradict this\n http://www.oca.org/pages/orth_chri/Orthodox-Faith/Worship/Holy-Eucharist.html",

   "From Irenaus of Lyons, c175-185AD\n Book V\n Chapter II.-When Christ Visited Us in His Grace, He Did Not Come to What Did Not Belong to Him: Also, by Shedding His True Blood for Us, and Exhibiting to Us His True Flesh in the Eucharist, He Conferred Upon Our Flesh the Capacity of Salvation.\n \n 1. And vain likewise are those who say that God came to those things which did not belong to Him, as if covetous of another's property; in order that He might deliver up that man who had been created by another, to that God who had neither made nor formed anything, but who also was deprived from the beginning of His own proper formation of men. The advent, therefore, of Him whom these men represent as coming to the things of others, was not righteous; nor did He truly redeem us by His own blood, if He did not really become man, restoring to His own handiwork what was said [of it] in the beginning, that man was made after the image and likeness of God; not snatching away by stratagem the property of another, but taking possession of His own in a righteous and gracious manner. As far as concerned the apostasy, indeed, He redeems us righteously from it by His own blood; but as regards us who have been redeemed, [He does this] graciously. For we have given nothing to Him previously, nor does He desire anything from us, as if He stood in need of it; but we do stand in need of fellowship with Him. And for this reason it was that He graciously poured Himself out, that He might gather us into the bosom of the Father.\n \n 2. But vain in every respect are they who despise the entire dispensation of God, and disallow the salvation of the flesh, and treat with contempt its regeneration, maintaining that it is not capable of incorruption. But if this indeed do not attain salvation, then neither did the Lord redeem us with His blood, nor is the cup of the Eucharist the communion of His blood, nor the bread which we break the communion of His body.10 For blood can only come from veins and flesh, and whatsoever else makes up the substance of man, such as the Word of God was actually made. By His own blood he redeemed us, as also His apostle declares, \"In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the remission of sins.\"11 And as we are His members, we are also nourished by means of the creation (and He Himself grants the creation to us, for He causes His sun to rise, and sends rain when He wills12 ). He has acknowledged the cup (which is a part of the creation) as His own blood, from which He bedews our blood; and the bread (also a part of the creation) He has established as His own body, from which He gives increase to our bodies.13 \n \n 3. When, therefore, the mingled cup and the manufactured bread receives the Word of God, and the Eucharist of the blood and the body of Christ is made,14 from which things the substance of our flesh is increased and supported, how can they affirm that the flesh is incapable of receiving the gift of God, which is life eternal, which [flesh] is nourished from the body and blood of the Lord, and is a member of Him?-even as the blessed Paul declares in his Epistle to the Ephesians, that \"we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones.\"15 He does not speak these words of some spiritual and invisible man, for a spirit has not bones nor flesh;16 but [he refers to] that dispensation [by which the Lord became] an actual man, consisting of flesh, and nerves, and bones,-that [flesh] which is nourished by the cup which is His blood, and receives increase from the bread which is His body. And just as a cutting from the vine planted in the ground fructifies in its season, or as a corn of wheat falling into the earth and becoming decomposed, rises with manifold increase by the Spirit of God, who contains all things, and then, through the wisdom of God, serves for the use of men, and having received the Word of God, becomes the Eucharist, which is the body and blood of Christ; so also our bodies, being nourished by it, and deposited in the earth, and suffering decomposition there, shall rise at their appointed time, the Word of God granting them resurrection to the glory of God, even the Father, who freely gives to this mortal immortality, and to this corruptible incorruption,17 because the strength of God is made perfect in weakness,18 in order that we may never become puffed up, as if we had life from ourselves, and exalted against God, our minds becoming ungrateful; but learning by experience that we possess eternal duration from the excelling power of this Being, not from our own nature, we may neither undervalue that glory which surrounds God as He is, nor be ignorant of our own nature, but that we may know what God can effect, and what benefits man receives, and thus never wander from the true comprehension of things as they are, that is, both with regard to God and with regard to man. And might it not be the case, perhaps, as I have already observed, that for this purpose God permitted our resolution into the common dust of mortality,19 that we, being instructed by every mode, may be accurate in all things for the future, being ignorant neither of God nor of ourselves?\n http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/anf01-63.htm#P8920_2554446",

   "Although the word Eucharist does not appear in the English Bible, the New Testament was written in Greek.\n \"\"For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks [Gr. eucharistesas], He broke it and said, 'Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.' In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me'\" (1 Cor. 11:23-25).\n \n With these words - quoting the same words of Christ in Luke 22:19, 20 - St. Paul instructs the Corinthians concerning the Eucharist, the giving of thanks. Some two thousand years after Jesus gave Himself \"for the life of the world\" (John 6:51), there are in Christendom at least three different interpretations of His words.\"\n http://home.it.com.au/~jgrapsas/pages/Eucharist.htm\n \n The word Eucharist is based on the Greek word 'eucharistesas' which is in the original Greek.\n \n Jesus said the bread and wine ARE His Body and Blood. He commanded we partake of it, and to do it in memory of Him. He asks us to do this until He returns.\n \n \"By using these words \"DO THIS\", He sets forth a command, not a request. This command is to be obeyed by all Christians until His coming again.\"\n http://www.onearthasinheaven.com/communion.html\n \n For those of you who believe in the Bible as the Word of God, what do you make of it when Jesus says \"Take, eat this is my Body\"? How do you turn this into an allegory?\n \n The problem for Terral et al is that even though Jesus asks us to do this thing; celebrate the Body and Blood of Jesus, Terral still insists it's a man-made ceremony.\n \n \"What do the Scriptures teach concerning the Eucharist? \n 1. Jesus said: \"This is My body ... this is My blood\" (Luke 22:19, 20). There is never a statement that these gifts merely symbolise His Body and Blood. Critics have charged that Jesus also said of Himself, \"I am the door\" (John 10:7), and He certainly is not a seven-foot wooden plank. The flaw in that argument is obvious: at no time has the Church ever believed He was a literal door. But she has always believed the consecrated gifts of bread and wine are truly His Body and Blood. \n 2. In the New Testament, those who received Christ's Body and Blood unworthily are said to bring condemnation upon themselves. \"For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep\" (literally, \"are dead\"; 1 Cor. 11:30). A mere symbol, a quarterly reminder, could hardly have the power to cause sickness and death! \n 3. Historically, from the New Testament days on, the central act of worship, the new apex of spiritual sacrifice, took place \"on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread\" (Acts 20:7). The Eucharist has always been that supreme act of thanksgiving and praise to God in His Church.\"\n http://www.3saints.com/eucharist.html",

   "Hi Spartacus:\n \n \nSpartacus << Forgive me because I am new here. But am I to understand from your reading that you are a former Roman Catholic who has since renounced Catholicism...or rather joined a Church whose authority is Sola Scriptura?\n\n \n Parents raised me in the Baptist tradition, and I converted to Catholicism in the late 1970's. I then renounced that denomination in the early 1980's to be trained by dispensationalists. When I began to point out inconsistencies in their views, then I became non-denominational. Denominational Christians are all your friends, until you begin disagreeing with their theology. They expect you to be like one of those bobble head dolls that nods up and down. Then you can be called \"brother.\" \n \n \nSpartacus << If that is the case...can you please tell me where in the Bible it states one only needs the Bible to understand and appreciate God's message?\n\n \n To understand Holy Scripture, one must have the Author within him. Scripture says, \n \n \n\"For to us God revealed {them} through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. For who among men knows the {thoughts} of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the {thoughts} of God no one knows except the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God, which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual {thoughts} with spiritual {words.} But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised. But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one.\" 1Cor. 2:10-15.\n\n \n \nSpartacus << Also...Why do \"Bible-based\" Churches see fit to ignore Apostolic Traditions in the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches...but have no problem basing their Church on the Holy Bible -- which is also a product of the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches -- mostly Orthodox? \n \n \n Surely you jest. I will suggest an answer here, having worked in churches of many denominations. The common error of the RC Church and the Orthodox Church is that both have mixed together the precepts of Kingdom Doctrine (for the bride of Christ) and Grace Doctrine (for the body of Christ) to create their own deluded and distorted versions of Christian Religions. Your statement about 'Apostolic Tradition' is a dead give-away that you are also under the spell of the deluded influence (2Thes. 2:10-12). Our Gentile Church today has absolutely no doctrinal association with Peter, John and James. We are members of the body of Christ (Eph. 4:12, 5:30, etc.) , and the Gentile Church (mystery among the Gentiles: Col. 1:27) of the Pauline Epistles. \n \n Please read Paul's letter to the Galatians again. Have you noted that Paul was sent down to submit our gospel to Peter, John and James? Gal. 2:2? Do you realize that Paul and Peter sat on opposite sides of the table? Or that Paul condemned Peter for being wrong about the 'truth of the gospel?' Gal. 2:14. Did you see that it was decided that Paul would continue going to the Gentiles, while Peter, John and James would go to the Circumcised? Gal. 2:9? Paul makes statements like, \"But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry.\" Rom. 11:13. And that he is, \"a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles.\" Rom. 15:9. Please go into the letters of Peter, John and James and show us just one example of any of them speaking to the Gentiles in the first person. Good luck, my friend, because none of them do that even once. Go back to Acts 2 again, and note that Peter is addressing \"Men of Israel.\" Acts 2:22. \n \n The Pauline Epistles were written 'to' Gentiles living in this 'dispensation of God's grace' (Eph. 3:2). The Hebrew Epistles were written 'to' Messianic Israel living in the coming Kingdom Dispensation. Therefore, this 'Apostolic Tradition' concept is the source of much unsound doctrine and distorted teaching. When James says, \"For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one {point,} he has become guilty of all (James 2:10), then he is not talking to you and me today. He is addressing the \"Royal Priesthood\" of 1Pet. 2:9, i.e., those seeking the Kingdom of God on earth in the coming Messianic Kingdom. \n \n \nSpartacus << A side note . . . \n \n \n All of that denominational ritualistic info appears to add little to this thread. Men can decide to perform their rituals for a variety of reasons. If Paul intended for us to have priests, then he would have said so. \n \n \nSpartacus << ALSO...Monty....It can reasonably be argued that baptism is the oldest Christian ritual -- not the Lord's Supper.\n\n \n Our 'one baptism' (Eph. 4:5) is by the Spirit of God. 1Cor. 12:13. Peter's water baptism for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38) has nothing to do with our salvation. Christ died for our sins on the cross, and our redemption is in His blood. Eph. 1:7, Col. 1:20. \n \n The RC Church and the Orthodox Church practice religion (Latin: religios; to bind back). They are trying to bind themselves back to God with works and rituals. \n \n True Christianity is a relationship between you and the Father, through His Son, by power of the Holy Spirit; a faith. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

So, they have been wrong for a long time. \n \n \nMontalban << He took the bread, broke it and said this is my Body. He said do this in memory of me. You seem to think He's acting in one thing, but talking about something else. It's like I pick up a cup and say \"I have a cup\" and you'd think that the words I say have no relationship to the actual action, but could refer to 'a cup to come' or something else. There's some kind of inability to draw a very clear link.\n \n \n Christ did not say \"Do this every day.\" You put those words into His mouth. He was also not speaking to any Gentiles. Again, you put that context into His mind. Doing something in memory is not performing some ritual in a Gentile Church every day or every week. Those are your errant interpretations created to justify these man-made rituals. Those points have already been proven to the third party reader on this thread. I am not here to convince you of anything. \n \n \nMontalban << Then simply you have deny Jesus' words when He asks us to partake in His body and blood \n \n \n Us? There were no Gentiles at the Lord's Passover supper. Peter is clearly addressing \"Men of Israel\" (Acts 2:22) in Acts 2. You say 'us,' when the Bible clearly shows Jews under Mosaic Law being addressed. Since you wish to ascribe 'us' to Christ's words at the Lord's Passover supper, then you must also interpret His commands in Matthew 5 the same way. He said, \"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.\" Matt. 5:17+18. Guess what Montalban? You have 660 different statutes of Mosaic Law to keep from now, until heaven and earth pass away. James is in full agreement, saying, \"For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one {point,} he has become guilty of all.\" James 2:10. \n \n Christ was not talking to 'us' Gentiles in Matthew 5, nor is He talking to 'us' in Matthew 26. He is addressing Jews under Mosaic Law while keeping the Law Himself. You are interpreting His words in Matthew 26 in one way, while disregarding a multitude of His commands to Israel at the very same time. You do not see the folly of such interpretations, but I see them clearly. Your entire case is build upon sand, and you have no clue. So continue to shovel this stuff too and fro. Someone's garden can use it.\n \n \nMontalban << And they say Americans don't understand irony.\n \n \n Who are they? \n \n \nMontalban << So, in fact what you do, is you go against the faith of the early church, deny what Jesus says of the bread and wine, concoct some theory that allows for the Trinity based on the non-existence of the word, in the Bible, but this rule doesn't apply to Eucharist. Then you have some novel theory about the ministry of St. Paul being the fruition of Jesus' Word - because it's only after he is converted do you believe that Jewish custom ends.\n\n \n I have already concluded that you do not see it, Montalban; for certain. You ignore the warnings of Peter and Paul. That takes guts. Instead you continue to peddle these works based rituals, as if Christ can be contained in bread and wine. Since your church fathers have been doing this for centuries, that is all the reason for you to follow in their footsteps; even if you have not the slightest idea where they lead.

   "Kronus I read the article and di not view it as \"anti-Christian\" at all.\n \n Rather I found it quite it humorous ....and sad...that a Roman Catholic priest allowed this to become such a big deal....\n \n A person is intolerant of wheat and gluton...no problem a few drops from the Chalice will suffice. An Orthodox Priest would not have had to think more than 1/3 of second to arrive at this. Orthodox Priests commune infants in this manner. It also would have been acceptable in the Roman Catholic Church.\n \n However what we are finding today in Roman Catholicsm is an increasing tendency to deny the chalice to children and offer them only \"wafers\". In my old RC Diocese (before I became Orthodox) a child had to be 16 and in the presence of a parent to sip from the chalice......PAhlease...\n\n I don't remember reading anything in the article stating that the priest made a big deal out of this. I think the family did--because it is a bit of an emotional issue--an important milestone in many children's lives--so I can understand the mother's emotion to a certain degree. \n \n Perhaps the priest that invalidly administered a wheat free substitute did make a big deal out of things--because he didn't recognize the adequacy of the Blood. But the original priest did what he was supposed to do. He did not have to think any longer than an Orthodox priest. He most likely tried to do what you yourself stated would have been acceptable by the Catholic Church. He probably just followed the guidelines of the Church:\n \n http://www.usccb.org/liturgy/innews/1103.htm \n \n I think the problem was that the family did not want to have First Communion without a host. I'm not sure if they were open to the Blood alone. But it is not all clearly stated.",

   "It goes to show that the early church actually practiced the Eucharist. I know it doesn't support your stance, therefore you want to ignore it. \n \n\n \n It just shows that men have been walking according to the deluding influence from day one. Paul wrote, ?For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains {will do so} until he is taken out of the way.? 2Thes. 2:7.\n\n Odd that you should want to criticise the universal practices of the early church.\n \nI assume by BS you are attempting to show me your Christian self? I'm not judging you, as anyone here will tell you, I'm very quick to anger, however I don't think you doing it is any more conducive to civilised debate either. \n\n \nYour parrot like dribble means nothing, except for in your own mind.\n\n And the mind of the early church, and has continued down to the present day by a majority of Christians. Your own notion is, relatively recent, dating only from the times of Luther - it is a man-made doctrine.\n \nThe fact that these things are not Biblical has been thoroughly proven from this side of the debate, and there is absolutely no reason to continue making the same points over and over again. I am arguing with a natural man about the things of the spirit. 2Cor. 2:14+15. So you continue to quote your human sources about works and rituals, until the cows come home.\n\n I'm sorry that you believe that the words of Jesus are those of 'just a man'.\n Further, you throw in these Bible verses as if they actually have some connection to what's being said. It's like everytime you write I rebut Leviticus 18:23, as if this applies to you\n \nActually you do, because you accept the dogma of the Trinity which was given full voice at Council. It was done so to lay to rest the many and varied heresies that sprung up from those who ignored the teachings of Holy Tradition, and tried to rely only on the Bible.\n\n \nNo. I must admit to be totally ignorant to the teachings of your Orthodox brethren. \n\n That's not true. You accept the doctrine of the Trinity.\n \nNo, you came up with some strange concoction of a theory based on a noun based on a verb. I showed you the original Greek word in the context of the passages. Further to that, the word \"Trinity\" does not appear either, in the New Testament.\n\n \nThe verb eucharisteo (#2168) appears twice in the entire Matthew Gospel account. The noun does not appear there at all. Your church fathers hijacked the Greek verb and turned it into Holy Eucharist Sacrificial Ritual. The word ?Eucharist? is not an English word at all. It is someone?s invention. The fact that they invented this entire ritualistic ceremony many years ago means nothing. So, they have been wrong for a long time. \n\n And the noun \"Trinity\" doesn't appear at all; hence your concoction of a grammatical rule to rule out Eucharist.\n Further to that, it was you who came up with the nonsense of rebutting the Didache based on the meaning of the title word! That was a real hoot. You've not been forward in admitting that was a major error of logic.\n \nHe took the bread, broke it and said this is my Body. He said do this in memory of me. You seem to think He's acting in one thing, but talking about something else. It's like I pick up a cup and say \"I have a cup\" and you'd think that the words I say have no relationship to the actual action, but could refer to 'a cup to come' or something else. There's some kind of inability to draw a very clear link.\n\n \nChrist did not say ?Do this every day.? You put those words into His mouth.\n\n Did I? Did I say \"Do this every day\"? Please quote this. You don't even do it once, so I don't know what you're going on about anyway. Christ's saying \"Do this in memory of Me\" He's obviously not asking them to do it right away in memory of Him, because He's there - no need to 'remember' Him. You've never obeyed Christ on this one AT ALL, let alone 'every day'/\n \n He was also not speaking to any Gentiles.\n\n SO?\n \nAgain, you put that context into His mind. Doing something in memory is not performing some ritual in a Gentile Church every day or every week.\n\n We are a Gentile church, all of us who aren't Jews.\n \nThose are your errant interpretations created to justify these man-made rituals.\n\n No, that's our justification for following the words of Jesus. As shown in some detail, the very earliest Christians followed it; your own source from St. Paul to the Corinthians says that you must do it and think of it as the Body and Blood of Christ - that's excepting if you ignore v29, and you do, because it's inconvenient.\n \nThose points have already been proven to the third party reader on this thread. I am not here to convince you of anything.\n\n Really? Then what are you here for? You must be a masochist. :)\n \n Then simply you have deny Jesus' words when He asks us to partake in His body and blood \n\n \nUs? There were no Gentiles at the Lord?s Passover supper. Peter is clearly addressing ?Men of Israel? (Acts 2:22) in Acts 2. You say ?us,? when the Bible clearly shows Jews under Mosaic Law being addressed.

James is in full agreement, saying, ?For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one {point,} he has become guilty of all.? James 2:10. \n\n If there was no 'us' until St. Paul's conversion, then nothing Jesus did is meant for any of us, because Jesus did it all before St.Paul's conversion.\n As to the laws of the Jews, Jesus empowered His Apostles to act for Him. Hence they all gathered together after He left, and they decided to go preach to the Gentiles, and make Christianity a non-Jewish religion. St.Peter decided it's okay to eat pork. Do you eat pork? If you do, then you've broken this 'law'\n \n Christ was not talking to ?us? Gentiles in Matthew 5, nor is He talking to ?us? in Matthew 26. He is addressing Jews under Mosaic Law while keeping the Law Himself. You are interpreting His words in Matthew 26 in one way, while disregarding a multitude of His commands to Israel at the very same time.

You are ironic where you say \"Greetings\" at the beginning and \"God bless\" at the end, but in between is some open sore of words from someone full of hate.\n \nSo, in fact what you do, is you go against the faith of the early church, deny what Jesus says of the bread and wine, concoct some theory that allows for the Trinity based on the non-existence of the word, in the Bible, but this rule doesn't apply to Eucharist.

You'd put limits on God!\n \nSince your church fathers have been doing this for centuries, that is all the reason for you to follow in their footsteps;\n\n You got that right. Yes, if the church has been doing it since day 1, I see no reason to go against them. I've shown that they have, from within the Bible, and without. You simply ignore this, spin 1,500 years into the future, and rely on the 'man' Luther to guide you... then, and here's more irony, you claim when I follow Jesus' commandments that I'm following a man-made ritual. You put Luther ahead of Jesus.\n \n\n even if you have not the slightest idea where they lead. My work on this thread is finished.

   "Hey Terral,\n \n \nTerral's reply << Every aspect of the Lord's Passover pertains to Jesus Christ and His work on the cross. Remember again that the Lord's Passover Supper Ritual is all about SACRIFICE, and Israel's liberation from Egypt (slavery and death). For the people to live, the Passover lamb had to die. Grain is broken to make the bread. Grapes are crushed for the making of wine. What did Christ say? \"I am the bread of life.\" John 6:48. Therefore, the meat of the Passover lamb was His flesh; the bread was His body, and the wine of that Passover supper was His blood. Christ was telling the disciples that HE was the Passover Lamb. Please go back and read the story, where they had to kill the Passover lamb, put its blood on their doorways. As it is written, \n \n \"You shall take a bunch of HYSSOP and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the door of his house until morning. \"For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite {you.}\" Ex. 12:22+23.\n \n The door posts (vertical) and the lintel (horizontal) were wooden symbols of the cross. What did Christ say? \"I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.\" John 10:9. When Christ was on the cross, and asked for water, what did they give Him? \"A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon {a branch} {of} HYSSOP and brought it up to His mouth.\" John 10:29. \n \n After the crucifixion, Christ told these same disciples, \"\"These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.\" Luke 24:44. So Christ was explaining these parts of the Lord's Passover Supper to His disciples, in the same way that I am explaining them to you today. \n \n It is also written in Exodus 12:8 that \"they shall eat the flesh that night\" and in Exodus 12:10  that \"none of it shall remain until the morning.\" The Lamb of the Passover was to be eaten  and in Jesus' institution of the Eucharist he gave us an intimate union of \"dwelling within us as we were to dwell within him.\"\n \n \nOur Lord is speaking figuratively concerning the things of the Spirit. Christ Himself tells you, \"It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.\" John 6:63. Today, we feed upon God's Word in the form of Holy Scripture. Christ said, \"This is the bread which came down out of heaven; not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live forever.\" John 6:58. Then, Paul writes, \"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" Rom. 6:23. As manna was the gift of the Lord God from heaven, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\" Eph. 2:8+9. \n \n If the Lord was speaking figuratively then why do some of his disciples leave because what he taught was a \"hard saying?\" (John 6:60, 6:66) Why did Jesus not draw them back and say, wait you misunderstand me, I am only speaking symbolically about the Spirit? Why is this the only parable where Jesus does not elucidate his figurative language to the apostles?\n \n \nThe Apostle Paul did not seek to replace the Spirit of God with his eating and drinking. He did not fabricate a Holy Eucharist Sacrificial Communion Ritual from the Lord's Passover Supper where the Word of God is being replaced with bread and wine. Paul told these fleshy Corinthians, \"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20. He never even mentions this to any of the other churches. Instead, Paul says that food and drink are 'mere shadows.' Col. 2:16+17. \n \n No, Paul did not fabricate anything. Nor has the Church. Paul did not replace the Word with the Eucharist but he did in fact give such strong words about having the right attitude and understanding toward the body and blood that if one takes it lightly then he is condemning himself. It is so important that \"many of you are weak and ill, and some have died\" due to negligence in regard to the Body and Blood. (1 Corinthians 11: 29-30)\n \n Those following Paul carried on this teaching in the early Church:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Real_Presence.asp  \n \n \nWe are baptized into one body (1Cor. 12:13) the moment we hear and believe the Gospel. Eph. 1:13+14. This mystery among the Gentiles (\"Christ in you\" Col. 1:27) is about hearing and believing the gospel. Col. 1:24-27, Rom. 16:25. The Church itself is the body of Christ. 1Cor. 12:27, Eph. 5:30, etc.. It is some among us who are practicing idolatry by replacing the things of the Spirit of God with these man-made rituals. Scripture says, \n \n These are of the Spirit, Maximus, and Christ does not get into anyone by eating bread and drinking wine during cerimonial rituals. \n \n We are baptized into one body, no one argues that. But that is not to say that there are not more than one images and fulfillments of the Body of Christ. There are often several deep meanings and layers of scripture. Abundant examples of that can be demonstrated (just as this is demonstrated with the Church as the Bride of Christ). If we are baptized into one body we are also joined in one body by partaking of the Eucharist. Paul explicitly tells us this:\n \n 1 Corinthians 10:16-17  \"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.\"\n \n I do not understand why the Eucharist of the Church is idolatry being that it is worship of Jesus Christ. Can you explain that to me? How is worship of Jesus Christ and following his command to \"do this in remembrance of me\" idolatry? \n \n Furthermore, you have yet to explain why Paul himself is not an idolater when Paul makes it clear that he believes the breaking of the bread and drinking of the cup, when commemorated properly, to be the actual body and blood of Jesus (1 Corinthians 10:16-17, 1 Corinthians 11:23-32)\n \n I am also still interested to know why Paul celebrates the Eucharist being that he quit administering the Kingdom Gospel and began administering the Gospel of Grace. Why does he partake of a Kingdom Covenant and why does he teach his Gentile churches to do so?",
