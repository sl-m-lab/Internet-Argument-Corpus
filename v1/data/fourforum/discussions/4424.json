   "Americans proclaimed that recent \"Iraqi elections went better than any realist could have expected\". I'm that realist and there is no surprise for me that Bush administration tries to present these elections as \"triumph of democracy\". But let's look at things honesty. Democracy is founded on freedom. It can't work in theocratic state. But the Shiite alliance, headed by the Grant Ayatollah Ali Sistani, won plurality of votes in Iraqi elections. And they've never concealed their intentions to establish an Iranian-style clerical regime there in the case of their victory. It must be clear for America that clerics can't build a democratic government. As Americans will never agree with such \"evolution of social and political life\" in Iraq, now I think they must actively prepare another variant of political developments there. It can be tactics of disruption according to ethno-confessional feature. In other words, USA will try to widen split between Kurdish North, Sunni Center and Shiite South. You see, a well-known principle \"Divide and rule\" is topical, as reliable instrument for creators of a new \"World Empire\" in our days, too.",

   "I believe he was refering to voter turnout and a sucessful election. Some people left their homes about 4 days early and camped around election sites, others walked/drove in huge armed groups to fend off attackers. I personally witnessed the consequences of an attack on one of these groups when an AIF(Anti-Iraqi Forces) sniper team of 6 opened up on a crowd of hundreds. They did not flee they charged and killed them and strung up their bodies. The insurgents that I have had contact with have ALL been foriegn. As for who was elected, we did not want to control who was elected that would defeat the purpose of a free election, but since you brought it up, the Shiite Alliance was just a huge party, they are not united in cause, if you speak to them they all have their own ideas, it will be interesting to see what happens from here. And on Clerics building a democracy, near Ramadii there is a community headed by a Shiite Cleric who provides their own security against insurgents(attacked frequently) and has been negotiating with oil companies to put a refinery in his area claiming it is secure, a refinery like this would create thousands of jobs for the Iraqi people of that area. He also aided the U.S. forces and ING(Iraqi National Guard) in protecting the election sites. I would say say that he is helping to build a democracy.",

   "What I am saying is that to the typical Iraqi, the elections were a very big deal. Alot of things over here that we(including myself) would over look back home that make the biggest differences to them are things like seeing Iraqi Soldiers and Police in uniforms and having their own people patrol their neighborhoods. The Iraqis seeing other Iraqis fighting to secure their own country is gives them far more pride than having Coalition patrols conduct the same operations. The point being is that the Iraqis want to see more Iraqi involvement in the day to day affairs so they voted. If they were apathetic to this then they would not have come out in such numbers to vote. This election demonstrated the determination of the typical Iraqi to live a free life.",

   "I read something today about even some of the European press are wondering now if Bush was right.\n Give it some time, you'll all see the big picture.\n\n :)\n \n http://www.jpnordin.com/gyroscope/gyro050207.htm\n \nThen, as a letter writer in today's New York Times pointed out, direct elections were not even Bush's plan. Bremmer proposed a series of appointments to a Constitutional Convention, and it was Ayatollah Ali al-Husseini al-Sistani who forced Bush's hand by demanding direct elections. Everyone raise their hand who now expect Bush to go on TV and say, \"boy, Ayatollah, you were right and I was wrong, thanks for the push.\" Will the Ayatollah be invited to the White House to receive a medal of freedom? Bremmer was. Maybe Sistani might eat some roast goat at the Crawford ranch if he was invited nicely.\n\n \n http://www.ijtihad.org/Iraqi%20Elections.htm\n \nWe must not forget that until Ayatollah Sistani insisted on early nationwide elections to the US was opposed to such an election and was determined to form a government based on local community representatives handpicked by the US. It was only after the US agreed to a nationwide elections to install a transitional government that will write the new constitution did the Shiite community cooperate with the occupation forces and the incipient Shiite insurgency led primarily by Moqtada Sadr in Najaf and other places fizzled out at the intervention of Ayatollah Sistani who expedited his return from Britain, on August 25, 2004, to placate the growing anger in Iraqi Shiites. \n \n \n http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FA17Ak02.html\n \nFor Sistani, direct elections in the short run guarantee the emergence of a Shi'ite-dominated order. For Bremer, indirect elections guarantee prolongation of US control on the political future of Iraq. These two visions are not contradictory, but they are not complementary either. So Sistani made clear what he wanted last June. Bremer attempted to change his mind, and he might have been misled by the intermediaries who were talking to him and the grand ayatollah. Sistani refused to grant audience to the foreign viceroy, thereby creating even a semblance of endorsing the US occupation. \n \n Now, since the security situation in Iraq seems to be somewhat calming down and the Americans are pushing more toward indirect elections, Sistani spoke with considerable vigor: the Iraqi provisional assembly due to select a government in June must be elected, not chosen from regional caucuses, as provided for in a November 15 agreement reached between Bremer and the Iraqi Governing Council. \n \n Hojatul Islam Ali Abdulhakim Alsafi, the second most senior cleric of Iraq, in a letter to President George W Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, has adopted a threatening tone by stating that their refusal to let the Iraqis chose their own institutions would drag their countries into a battle they would lose. Needless to say, Alsafi was saying what Sistani wasn't saying directly and explicitly, but really meant to say. \n \n \n So, according to these articles, what Bush was right about was backing down to the Ayatolla!",
