   "Dr. James W. Holsinger, Jr. is an American physician. On May 24, 2007, President George W. Bush announced his intention to nominate Holsinger to become the eighteenth Surgeon General of the United States.\n \n Holsinger has a doctorate in anatomy and physiology and a medical degree from Duke University. He also holds a master's degree in hospital financial management from the University of South Carolina and a bachelor's degree from the University of Kentucky in human studies as well as a master's degree in biblical studies from Asbury Theological Seminary.\n \n Most of Holsinger's career (1969 to 1994) was spent with the Veterans Administration, renamed in 1989 as the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. [1] After leaving the federal government, he led the State of Kentucky's healthcare system, and the University of Kentucky's medical center. He also has taught at several American medical schools, and he served more than three decades in the United States Army Reserve, retiring in 1993 as a Major General.\n \n While Holsinger was the chief medical director of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the department was criticized for the quality of the care it provided. In 1991, Holsinger acknowledged that inadequate care had caused the deaths of six patients at its hospital in North Chicago, Illinois. [2] Later that year, a federal health-care investigator, testifying before a Congressional subcommittee, reported finding problems at more than 30 other veterans hospitals. [3] Holsinger responded that the system was \"obviously not perfect\" but that it provided \"first-rate care\".\n \n Holsinger has been active in the United Methodist Church. As a member of its Judicial Council, the highest judicial body within the UMC, he joined with the majority in a controversial decision arising from the attempt to remove an openly lesbian pastor from her post. On April 29, 2004, by a vote of six to three, the Council ruled:\n \n Since the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching, self-avowed practicing homosexuals are not to be accepted as candidates, ordained as ministers, or appointed to serve in The United Methodist Church. [4]\n \n In 1991, Holsinger had resigned from a UMC panel on homosexuality; Time reported that he had left the panel \"because he felt certain its conclusions would follow liberal lines.\" [5]\n \n Holsinger and his wife founded Hope Springs Community Church, which, according to its pastor, David C\n \n alhoun, ministers to people who no longer wish to be gay or lesbian.

   "Bush's Pick for Surgeon General Makes Us Sick: Killed Veterans, Hates Gays, Loves Republicans\n Submitted by BuzzFlash on Fri, 05/25/2007 - 1:58pm. Analysis\n \n A BUZZFLASH NEWS ANALYSIS\n \n Dr. James Holsinger was tapped by President Bush Thursday to be the nation's next Surgeon General. Sure enough, Holsinger's record is mired with incompetence, zealous conservatism, and, of course, sizable campaign contributions to Republicans.\n \n As Chief Medical Director of the Department of Veterans Affairs under Bush's father, Dr. Holsinger was neglecting our vets long before Walter Reed made it fashionable. A government investigation found \"several cases in which incompetence and neglect led to the deaths of patients.\" Dr. Holsinger was forced to admit blame for the deaths of six patients in less than a year at a single Chicago hospital alone.\n \n But the problems weren't limited to Chicago. In a Wyoming, a patient scheduled for surgery for a treatable cancer died after he was ignored for 45 days following the resignation of the staff urologist over a contract dispute. Thirty VA hospitals were found to have \"high numbers of patient complications and other indicators of substandard care.\"\n \n A decade later, Dr. Holsinger was appointed Kentucky's Cabinet Secretary for Health and Family Services. By the end of his tenure, a Kentucky newspaper found that the state was at the bottom of the nation for almost every health measure. Kentuckians die at a rate of 18 percent above the national average, the newspaper reported.\n \n \"We don't have to worry about foreign aggressors. We are killing ourselves off,\" said Dr. Baretta Casey, a Hazard physician and University of Kentucky professor. \"I see a lot of illnesses similar to a third-world country,\" added Dr. Sandra Dionisio, a Kentucky internist trained in the Philippines.\n \n \"We've got some big mountains to climb,\" Dr. Holsinger said of the findings, a few months before he jumped ship for a cushy teaching job at the University of Kentucky.\n \n So why does Bush want Dr. Holsinger to be the nation's top doc? For starters, he hates gay people. As president of the United Methodist Church's Judicial Council, Holsinger ruled in 2004 that \"the practice of homosexuality is a chargeable offense for clergy\" after a highly publicized internal trial for openly lesbian pastor Karen Dammann.\n \n In 1991, Dr. Holsinger resigned from church panel studying homosexuality \"because he felt certain its conclusions would follow liberal lines.\"\n \n Last year, a Methodist pastor blasted Dr. Holsinger for essentially trying to embezzle some $20 million from the Methodist Church through a charity Holsinger chairs. Holsinger has lost in court twice on the matter but continues to appeal through the legal system.\n \n The coup de grace of the Dr. Holsinger story is his more than $16,000 in political donations since 1998 - all to Republicans, including George W. Bush. You can bet Cheney also had a role in the appointment since Dr. Holsinger specializes in cardiology.\n \n Dr. Holsinger seems like a great choice for the VP to take hunting, but he hardly seems like the best candidate out of all the doctors in America to become our next Surgeon General.\n \n A BUZZFLASH NEWS ANALYSIS",

   "AlterNet\n Bush Nominates Surgeon General Who Supports 'Ex-Gay' Therapy\n By Max Blumenthal, HuffingtonPost.com\n Posted on June 12, 2007, Printed on June 12, 2007\n http://www.alternet.org/story/53849/\n \n James Holsinger, President George W. Bush's nominee for Surgeon General, has a dark view of homosexuals. In a 1991 paper, Holsinger describes homosexual sex in sickeningly lurid language. \"Fist fornication,\" \"sphincter injuries,\" \"lacerations,\" \"perforations\" and \"deaths seen in connection with anal eroticism,\" are some of the terms Holsinger concocted to describe acts with which he suggests at least medical familiarity (a case of participant observation, perhaps?). At the same paper, Holsinger puzzlingly issues no warnings about the dangers of heterosexual sex in his paper. To him, only \"anal eroticism\" is a health peril.\n \n Holsinger's allies -- those who lobbied the White House for his nomination -- include James Dobson's Focus on the Family and the Heritage Foundation. They have predictably cast his confirmation battle as a religious test, alleging that his homophobia is a reflection of orthodox Christian views. To oppose Holsinger on the grounds of his anti-gay sentiments, the right says, is to discriminate against him simply for being a bible-believing Christian. Why should he have to check his Christianity at the church exit door? they ask. This worn-out appeal to the Christian right's victimhood complex distracts from the most salient argument against Holsinger's confirmation -- which is exactly what it is intended to do.\n \n For a moment let's put aside the moral case against Holsinger's confirmation, and objectively examine his qualifications for America's top doctor. Holsinger and his wife were founders of Hope Springs Community Church. This church, according to its pastor, Rev. David Calhoun, has an \"ex-gay\" ministry that administers \"reparative therapy\" to people who no longer wish to be gay. \"We see that as an issue not of orientation but a lifestyle,\" Calhoun says. \"We have people who seek to walk out of that lifestyle.\"\n \n Holsinger believes in ex-gay therapy. He therefore views homosexuality as a curable disease. Every major, reputable medical organization rejects ex-gay therapy and the notion that homosexuality constitutes a mental illness. Every single one. The most notable of these organizations is the American Psychological Association, the country's largest organization of mental health professionals. In 1974, the APA stopped listing homosexuality as a mental disorder; last year, the group issued a pointed repudiation to the ideological proponents of ex-gay therapy. (It's worth adding that conversion therapy supporters have not produced one single word of peer-reviewed work to support their theories).\n \n Holsinger's belief in discredited, crack-pot \"conversion\" therapy puts him in direct conflict with virtually the entire American medical community. Holsinger can believe in radical evangelical doctrine and he can hold bigoted views. As lamentable as these traits are, they don't necessarily disqualify him for Surgeon General -- though they certainly cast a dark shadow over his nomination. What instantly disqualifies Holsinger is his rejection of medical science. He can be politically incorrect, but he can't be medically incorrect.\n \n If history is any guide, conservatism and respect for science are not mutually exclusive. Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, the co-author of a strident anti-abortion tract with evangelical dominionist godfather Francis Schaeffer, respected science. In the face of massive resistance from right-wing activists, Koop used his prestige to advocate for sex education and condom use to stanch the rising epidemic of AIDS. For Koop's stand on medical principle, his one-time allies pressured Reagan into forcing him to resign. There is no indication Holsinger will follow Koop's principled path.\n \n When Holsinger goes before the Senate, ex-gay therapy goes on trial. He and his Republican supporters should be compelled to state their views on homosexuality and the crackpot practice the Christian right employs to \"cure\" people of it. Is homosexuality a treatable disease and how do they know it? (This question should be asked of GOP presidential contenders as well). If and when Holsinger's nomination goes down in flames, ex-gay therapy will have received its most decisive repudiation yet.\n \n Max Blumenthal is a Puffin Foundation writing fellow at the Nation Institute based in Washington, DC.

What instantly disqualifies Holsinger is his rejection of medical science. He can be politically incorrect, but he can't be medically incorrect.\n\n \n With this particular issue, even if that's really what Holsinger believes (and I'm not convinced his enemies aren't misrepresenting it some), I don't think it's a large enough issue to be a problem, and that's exactly why it probably won't stop him from getting the position. It's not like it's a major medical issue or something. A lot of people probably don't even know what this movement is, and most certainly a lot of people I've run into here who oppose it seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of it. (though there are some uncommon fringe groups that do truly try to turn people ex-gay.) Personally, I think this whole movement to discredit Holsinger with the 'ex-gay'-belief-thing is much ado about nothing. As Obvious Child said, what are his views on actual pertinent medical issues?\n \n Regarding this issue, it seems to me that the \"conversion/ex-gay\" thing is ultimately a matter of letting people just do what they want to do. Why should it be gay-rights-proponents' business what others do with their lives? After all, those same gays don't want others interfering with them. If some gays want to live according to Christian beliefs and not live that way, then that's their choice. I don't see what the big deal is. It seems to me that if gays want people to let them live their life they way they want to, then they in turn should be willing to let other gays (who don't happen to want to live the same way) do what they want to do as well and not \"be\" gay. I hear the argument made sometimes that people shouldn't concern themselves with what goes on in gay peoples' bedrooms; well, the same applies--gay rights proponents shouldn't be concerning themselves with what doesn't go on in other gays' bedrooms either.",

   "Criticism surprises Holsinger colleagues\n \n \nIn 1988, Holsinger began serving on a national church [United Methodist Church]committee to study homosexuality and make recommendations on whether church doctrine should be changed.\n \n The committee took four years to consider the issue, and, in 1991, Holsinger wrote a paper entitled the Pathophysiology of Male Homosexuality. In it, he makes a biological argument that gay sex is unnatural and unhealthy. He argues that, like male and female pipe fittings, certain body parts are designed for one another.\n \n The paper has drawn wide criticism from gay-rights groups. They say it represents an out-dated view, even for 1991, of gay sex. The American Psychological Association, for example, removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973.\n \n Christina Pearson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, said Holsinger had been asked by the committee to compile peer-reviewed scientific data on health issues facing gays.\n \n \"Since then, the science has deepened with continued research on these issues,\" Pearson said in a statement.\n \n Shortly after he submitted the paper, Holsinger withdrew from the committee. At the time, the committee was beginning to form its opinion, said the Rev. Phil Wogaman, who served on the committee and is now retired.\n \n Most of the members wanted to remove language from church doctrine that said the church did not condone homosexuality and \"considered its practice incompatible with Christian teaching,\" Wogaman said.\n \n The majority believed that homosexuality, if practiced in a caring, committed relationship, was acceptable, Wogaman said. \"When the majority was beginning to form its views, Dr. Holsinger was in strong disagreement with that and chose to leave the committee, in some anger,\" Wogaman said.\n \n Holsinger opposed any recognition of homosexuality as normal, Wogaman said. \"He took the view that it's pathological, that homosexuality is both sin and a kind of mental sickness,\" Wogaman said. \"He was quite vocal about it.\"\n \n Bishop Richard Looney, who also served on the committee and has since retired, shared Holsinger's view. \"He supports the church's position, as do I,\" Looney said, \"which is that all persons are of sacred worth, but that the practice is not compatible with Christian teaching.\"\n\n \n No-one who thinks homosexuality is \"both sin and a kind of mental sickness\" has any business being in such a position. Now, I don't much care what self-style \"Christians\" think about the morality of homosexuality, so long as they keep their opinions to themselves and outside civil law and, in this case, medical practice. \n \n But the opinion that homosexuality is pathological and some sort of mental disease has been rejected by every mainstream American medical association that isn't a Christianist front. There is no way that such a doctor can be considered fit for the post of \"America's chief medical educator\", when he is so ignorant about this issue. \n \n There is nothing he can educate anyone on, except the fatuity of prejudice, and he can do that without a government salary and soapbox from which to preach hatred of gay people.",

   "Here is a careful refutation of Holsinger's anti-gay diatribes:\n \n A Closer Look at Dr. James Holsinger's \"Pathophysiology of Male Homosexuality\"\n Conclusion\n \n The whole point of Holsinger's paper is to draw a sharp contrast between gay relationships and heterosexual relationships. But to do so, he he culls his evidence largely from papers which describe injuries from nonconsensual intercourse to denigrate consensual relationships, he describes odd sexual practices that are enjoyed by heterosexual couples to denigrate the minority of gay couples who indulge in those same practices, and he misleads his readers by padding his bibliography with more references to papers explicitly describing injuries experienced by heterosexual men and women to imply that they describe gay men instead.\n \n In other words, to describe gay sexual acts, more often than not he turned to papers which describe injuries sustained through heterosexual activity. And then he used this evidence from heterosexual activity to say that \"when the complementarity of the sexes is breached, injuries and diseases may occur as noted above.\" But what does this evidence suggest about \"complementarity\" in heterosexual relationships? Holsinger doesn't answer.\n \n But worse, Holsinger made the fatal error of ignoring the bonds of affection and devotion that arise in gay and lesbian couples. He reduced the rich complexity of their relationships to pipe fittings and how they interlock with each other. But the interlocking parts that fit together in relationships are those parts that fit sublimely. They have absolutely nothing to do with pipes or connectors or any other analogies drawn from the local Ace Hardware store.\n \n Whatever pretensions Holsinger may have had to presenting a scientific argument, this paper does not rise to that level. In fact, Holsinger deployed many of the same tactics other anti-gay extremists use in writing common anti-gay tracts. The result is not science, but propaganda.\n The point is that Holsinger is not an objective, scientific reviewer of literature on homosexuality. He's a homophobic, Christianist activist. We need him as Surgeon General like we need a hole in the head.",

Do not confound the two. Such confounding is the source of our social friction in this area.
