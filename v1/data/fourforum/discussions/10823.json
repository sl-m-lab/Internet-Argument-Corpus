   "The mistake of Astronomers about comets\n \n In the year 1705 the Astronomer Halley brought about his theory about the comet, and since then Astronomers started to orbit around Halley and his theory. \n \n He discovered a comet, which was called to his name, and said it was similar to the description of a comet that had come 76 years before. He said mostly this is the same comet that has come now, and it is expected to come 76 years later; because it orbits around the sun! \n \n Then they investigated the light spectrum, and found Na, Oxygen and Hydrogen, and some combinations of such elements in the tail of the comets, and they said another theory that the comet includes water in the form of ice and dust: a dirty ice in the inside of the comet head or body!\n \n Then others said there is a jet propulsion phenomenon of the water vapor that makes the tail more prominent!\n \n I say: this is very surprising how people believe about something, even though it is very strange; that is because it was told to them by a famous scientist; while if you or I tell them more reasonable ideas, they will laugh at it, then will ridicule you.\n \n Now, Halley and other scientists said: it is most probably, and most likely; but others who came after them took it as most certainly and absolutely. \n After the discovery of Kuiper belt, some scientists said that the comets came from this belt. \n \n What is the comet?\n \u0095The comet is a fire mass thrown out of the sun, following some local solar explosions, resulting in the hurling or shooting of such sparks or fire masses. \n \n God - be exalted - said in the Quran, 77: 32-34\n &#1573;&#1606;&#1617;&#1607;&#1575; &#1578;&#1614;&#1585;&#1618;&#1605;&#1616;&#1610; &#1576;&#1616;&#1588;&#1614;&#1585;&#1614;&#1585;&#1613; &#1603;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1614;&#1589;&#1618;&#1585;&#1616; . &#1603;&#1614;&#1571;&#1606;&#1617;&#1607;&#1615; &#1580;&#1616;&#1605;&#1575;&#1604;&#1614;&#1578;&#1612; &#1589;&#1615;&#1601;&#1618;&#1585;&#1612; . &#1608;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1604;&#1612; &#1610;&#1614;&#1608;&#1618;&#1605;&#1614;&#1574;&#1584;&#1613; &#1604;&#1616;&#1604;&#1605;&#1615;&#1603;&#1614;&#1584;&#1617;&#1616;&#1576;&#1616;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614; . \n The explanation: (32- It [: Hell] shoots sparks like the castle.\n 33- As it might be yellow thick ropes [of ships.]\n 34- Woe, on that day, to the deniers [of the Judgment Day.])\n The interpretation:\n -- Hell is the sun,\n -- (shoots sparks like the castle) means: the size of each one of these sparks which Hell or the sun throws out in the space is like the size of one of some large constructed palaces or castles; and its sparks, in fact, are the comets. For this reason God -be exalted - said &#1603;&#1614;&#1571;&#1606;&#1617;&#1607;&#1615; &#1580;&#1616;&#1605;&#1575;&#1604;&#1614;&#1578;&#1612; &#1589;&#1615;&#1601;&#1618;&#1585;&#1612; i.e. (As it might be yellow thick ropes [of ships.]); i.e. like the yellow stays of ships. God - be exalted - simulated the long tails of comets to the [long thick yellow] ropes of the ship. \n \u0095 The comet does not orbit the Sun, but goes on wandering about in the space. \n \u0095 They are oblong objects, not spherical like the planets and moons, and they do not rotate around themselves, neither do they rotate around the Sun, but they move along wandering about in the space. \n \u0095 They are relatively small objects, and will get colder by time, and their heads may then become a group of hot rocks. \n \u0095 They are more numerous than what one may think, but most of them are hiding and invisible; because of their relatively small volumes and particular sort of movement. \n \u0095 The tail following the head of the comet, being attracted to it by gravitation. The tail does not propel the comet, and there is no jet propulsion; on the contrary, sometimes the tail is in front of the head. The tail direction is always away from the sun. \n \u0095 The comet is very hot and flaming; its tail may include water vapor, but there is no ice in the comet. \n \u0095 The comet has affinity to the cold and freezing regions of the Earth (and other planets), and has repulsion with the hot objects like the Sun. \n \u0095 When a comet falls on the ground, it will melt the stone and dig in the surface to be buried under the ground; this is in comparison with the meteorite which when falls, will remain above the ground. Usually, the falling comet will lead to the formation of a crater. Its falling will cause burns, storms and quaking of the earth, and will destroy a wide area. \n \u0095 Life did not come to the Earth embedded in the comets, but in the meteorites; because comets are flaming objects, and fire kills the living cells. \n For more information about the comets refer to our website:\n http://universeandquran.741.com \n And make some clicks on:\n http://universeandquran.741.com/new_page_3.htm#Comets \n http://universeandquran.741.com/new_page_2.htm#MercksonMeteorite \n \n eanassir.",

Habitual observations and calculations of appearances after 240 BC are recorded by Chinese, Babylonian, Persian, and other Mesopotamian astronomers. \n \n 87 BC: According to V.G. Gurzadyan and R. Vardanyan, the \"Symbol on Tigranes the Great's crown that features a star with a curved tail may represent the passage of Halley's comet in 87 BC. Tigranes could have seen Halley's comet when it passed closest to the Sun on Aug. 6 in 87 BC according to the researchers, who said the comet would have been a 'most recordable event' - heralding the New Era of the brilliant King of Kings.[4] \n \n 12 BC: Some theologians have suggested that the comet's appearance in 12 BC might explain the Biblical story of the Star of Bethlehem.[5] \n \n 66 AD: In the Talmud, it is mentioned that \"There is a star which appears once in seventy years that makes the captains of the ships err\".[6] Since this quote is attributed to the Rabbi Yehoshua ben Hananiah, if it is indeed a reference to Halley's Comet, it probably refers to the AD 66 perihelion, which was the only one to occur during his lifetime.[7] \n \n 837: In this year, it is calculated that Comet Halley may have passed as close as 0.03 AU (3.2 million miles; 5.1 million kilometres) from Earth, by far its closest approach. Its tail may have stretched 90 degrees across the sky.[8] \n \n 1066: The comet was seen in England and thought to be an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings. Thus it was a bad omen for Harold, but a good omen for William the Conqueror. Shown on the Bayeux Tapestry, and the accounts which have been preserved represent it as having then appeared to be four times the size of Venus, and to have shone with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. This appearance of the comet is also noted in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Having first seen it as a young boy in 989, Eilmer of Malmesbury declared prophetically in 1066: \"You've come, have you?...You've come, you source of tears to many mothers, you evil. I hate you! It is long since I saw you; but as I see you now you are much more terrible, for I see you brandishing the downfall of my country. I hate you!\" [9]. Chaco Native Americans in New Mexico recorded this 1066 comet in their petroglyphs.[10] \n \n 1301: The artist Giotto di Bondone could have observed the comet and his depiction of the Star of Bethlehem in the Nativity in the Arena Chapel cycle completed in 1305 is a candidate for an early depiction. \n \n 1456: The comet passed very close to the Earth; its tail extended over 60\u00b0 of the heavens and took the form of a sabre. According to one story, first appearing in a posthumous biography in 1475 and later embellished and popularized by Pierre-Simon Laplace, Pope Callixtus III excommunicated the 1456 apparition of the comet, believing it to be an ill omen for the Christian defenders of Belgrade, who were at that time being besieged by the armies of the Ottoman Empire. However, no known primary source supports the authenticity of this account. \n \n  Recent history\n The most recent appearances have been in 1835, 1910, and 1986. Halley will next return in 2061 or 2062.\n \n\n \n \nORBIT\n Halley's orbit is highly elliptical, and focused on the Sun. Its perihelion, its closest distance to the Sun, is just 0.6 AU (between the orbits of Mercury and Venus), while its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU, or roughly the distance of Pluto. Unusually for an object in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or clockwise from above the Sun's north pole. Its orbit is highly inclined (18\u00b0) to the ecliptic, with much of it lying below the orbits of the planets (assuming Earth's north pole is \"up\").[17][18]\n\n \n Orbits of several comets including this one:\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Orbits_of_periodic_comets.gif\n \n \n And here's a list of other Periodic Comets",

Both of these facts make it clear that you are just plain wrong.\n \n But you've never let facts get in the way of your beliefs, have you?\n\n \n There is difference about the definition of the comet and the asteroid.\n \n The comet:\n According to their definition, it is a cold mass consisting mostly of dirty ice in its centre, and that it comes from outside the orbit of Neptune and Pluto: from the Kuiper - Oort Belt: \n \n Long-period comets (those with periods longer than about 200 years) come from the Oort cloud, while short-period comets come from a ring of debris known as the Kuiper Belt. The Kuiper Belt, which starts just beyond the orbit of the planet Neptune\n \n According to this definition, it is ambiguous and hard to differentiate it from the asteroid. \n \n The asteroid:\n According to their definition: is any rock of some mass; it is inert and cold. Originally, this word was used for the Asteroids that occupy the vacant orbit between Mars and Jupiter. But now it is used in relation to any rock in the outerspace, and is usually irregular in shape.\n \n According to such view: there is no much difference between the comet and the asteroid, except that as they deem, there will be the characteristic tail of the comet, and they said it is the ice that evaporises and causes some jet propulsion.\n \n Accoring to our definition, and as was expressed by the late interpreter of the Quran and the Bible: Mohammed-Ali Hassan Al-Hilly:\n The comet is a very hot mass originating from the sun; the tail is hot gases attached to the body of the comet by the gravity of the hot comet. The comet is very hot.\n Whereas the asteroid is an inert and cold rock. The Asteroids are the remnants of a broken up planet that was existing in the past; their position is between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter; some of them rotate around Jupiter, and the rest rotate around Mars.\n \n Other celestial rocks may become the meteorites after their falling on the earth.\n \n When the comet falls on the ground, it will melt the stone and rock and the ground to be buried very deep inside the earth.\n \n So why will the asteroid, which is an inert dead rock, explode, and why such asteroid be more hot than the comet which is a very hot mass coming out of the sun?\n \n And it will lie very deep more than their usual digging; and usually it consists of multiple masses, some few fragments may scatter on the surface of the ground, and some of such fragments may be the fragments of the rocks on which the comet impacted; and because it is very hot it will cause less impacting effect like the cutting of metal by using a very hot flame.\n \n Moreover, I found that Oort himself proposed his idea about the comet, but those coming after him insisted on the ideas as if they are laws and rules.\n \n Why not, the Glorious Quran includes marvelous facts and statements and many secrets are still not recognized yet.\n As God - be glorified - said in the Quran 41: 53 \n &#1587;&#1614;&#1606;&#1615;&#1585;&#1616;&#1610;&#1607;&#1616;&#1605;&#1618; &#1570;&#1610;&#1614;&#1575;&#1578;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1601;&#1616;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1570;&#1601;&#1614;&#1575;&#1602;&#1616; &#1608;&#1614;&#1601;&#1616;&#1610; &#1571;&#1614;&#1606;&#1618;&#1601;&#1615;&#1587;&#1616;&#1607;&#1616;&#1605;&#1618; &#1581;&#1614;&#1578;&#1617;&#1614;&#1609; &#1610;&#1614;&#1578;&#1614;&#1576;&#1614;&#1610;&#1617;&#1614;&#1606;&#1614; &#1604;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1571;&#1614;&#1606;&#1617;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1581;&#1614;&#1602;&#1617;&#1615; &#1571;&#1614;&#1608;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1605;&#1618; &#1610;&#1614;&#1603;&#1618;&#1601;&#1616; &#1576;&#1616;&#1585;&#1614;&#1576;&#1617;&#1616;&#1603;&#1614; &#1571;&#1614;&#1606;&#1617;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615; &#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1609; &#1603;&#1615;&#1604;&#1617;&#1616; &#1588;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1569;&#1613; &#1588;&#1614;&#1607;&#1616;&#1610;&#1583;&#1612;\n The explanation:(We will show them Our portents [or signs] on the horizons [of the sky] and among themselves, until it will become manifest to them that [the Quran] is the truth.

   "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet\n \n \nComets are small Solar System bodies that orbit the Sun and, when close enough to the Sun, exhibit a visible coma (or atmosphere) and/or a tail - both primarily from the effects of solar radiation upon the comet's nucleus. Comet nuclei are themselves loose collections of ice, dust and small rocky particles, measuring a few kilometres or tens of kilometres across.\n \n Comets originate in the outer solar system; they are thrown inwards towards the Sun by gravitational perturbations from planets or nearby stars. They have a variety of different orbital periods, ranging from a few years, to 50 or 100 years, to thousands of years, while some are believed to pass through the inner Solar System only once before being thrown out into interstellar space. Short-period comets are thought to originate in the Kuiper Belt, which lies beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are believed to originate at a very much greater distance from the Sun, in a cloud (the Oort cloud) consisting of debris left over from the condensation of the solar nebula. Asteroids originate via a different process, but very old comets which have lost all their volatile materials may come to resemble asteroids.\n \n There are a reported 3,354 known comets as of November 2007,[1] of which several hundred are short-period. This number is steadily increasing. However, this represents only a tiny fraction of the total comet population: the reservoir of comet-like bodies in the outer solar system may number one trillion.[2] The number of naked-eye comets averages to roughly one per year,[3] though many of these are faint and unspectacular. When a historically bright or notable naked-eye comet is witnessed by many people, it is often considered a Great comet.\n\n \n Comets are not 'spit out of the sun' the only things that are spit out of the sun are coronal mass ejections, which is gaseous and energetic radiation!

Hydrogen and helium are lighter than air and could not descend through the atmosphere to the ground.\n \n \nThe tail is usually fainter and less bright than the head of the extremely hot comet;\n\n Comets are not extremely hot. They glow by reflected sunlight, like the moon and the other planets. Even if a comet were hot, it would rapidly lose that heat (it is far too small and light to continue the fusion reaction taking place in the sun). It is physically impossible for comets to remain 'hot' for the duration of their observed orbits.\n \n \nit may be more obvious when becoming somewhat near to the sun or it may be at the same time it is nearer to us on earth.\n\n Nope, sorry; comets first appear on their way in toward the sun at great distances, far beyond the earth's own orbit. Not one has, ever, ever ever ever been first seen moving away from the sun. :)\n \n It has been nice talking to you, but I do not believe further discussion on this topic will be fruitful. You are welcome to believe that we will in the future find evidence that comets are fireballs spat out of the sun, but until that time I will base my belief on the evidence we have that they are not.\n \n Take care!",

   "The mistake of Astronomers about comets\n \n In the year 1705 the Astronomer Halley brought about his theory about the comet, and since then Astronomers started to orbit around Halley and his theory. \n \n He discovered a comet, which was called to his name, and said it was similar to the description of a comet that had come 76 years before. He said mostly this is the same comet that has come now, and it is expected to come 76 years later; because it orbits around the sun! \n \n Then they investigated the light spectrum, and found Na, Oxygen and Hydrogen, and some combinations of such elements in the tail of the comets, and they said another theory that the comet includes water in the form of ice and dust: a dirty ice in the inside of the comet head or body!\n \n Then others said there is a jet propulsion phenomenon of the water vapor that makes the tail more prominent!\n \n I say: this is very surprising how people believe about something, even though it is very strange; that is because it was told to them by a famous scientist; while if you or I tell them more reasonable ideas, they will laugh at it, then will ridicule you.\n \n Now, Halley and other scientists said: it is most probably, and most likely; but others who came after them took it as most certainly and absolutely. \n After the discovery of Kuiper belt, some scientists said that the comets came from this belt. \n \n What is the comet?\n \u0095The comet is a fire mass thrown out of the sun, following some local solar explosions, resulting in the hurling or shooting of such sparks or fire masses. \n \n God - be exalted - said in the Quran, 77: 32-34\n &#1573;&#1606;&#1617;&#1607;&#1575; &#1578;&#1614;&#1585;&#1618;&#1605;&#1616;&#1610; &#1576;&#1616;&#1588;&#1614;&#1585;&#1614;&#1585;&#1613; &#1603;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1614;&#1589;&#1618;&#1585;&#1616; . &#1603;&#1614;&#1571;&#1606;&#1617;&#1607;&#1615; &#1580;&#1616;&#1605;&#1575;&#1604;&#1614;&#1578;&#1612; &#1589;&#1615;&#1601;&#1618;&#1585;&#1612; . &#1608;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1604;&#1612; &#1610;&#1614;&#1608;&#1618;&#1605;&#1614;&#1574;&#1584;&#1613; &#1604;&#1616;&#1604;&#1605;&#1615;&#1603;&#1614;&#1584;&#1617;&#1616;&#1576;&#1616;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614; . \n The explanation: (32- It [: Hell] shoots sparks like the castle.\n 33- As it might be yellow thick ropes [of ships.]\n 34- Woe, on that day, to the deniers [of the Judgment Day.])\n The interpretation:\n -- Hell is the sun,\n -- (shoots sparks like the castle) means: the size of each one of these sparks which Hell or the sun throws out in the space is like the size of one of some large constructed palaces or castles; and its sparks, in fact, are the comets. For this reason God -be exalted - said &#1603;&#1614;&#1571;&#1606;&#1617;&#1607;&#1615; &#1580;&#1616;&#1605;&#1575;&#1604;&#1614;&#1578;&#1612; &#1589;&#1615;&#1601;&#1618;&#1585;&#1612; i.e. (As it might be yellow thick ropes [of ships.]); i.e. like the yellow stays of ships. God - be exalted - simulated the long tails of comets to the [long thick yellow] ropes of the ship. \n \u0095 The comet does not orbit the Sun, but goes on wandering about in the space. \n \u0095 They are oblong objects, not spherical like the planets and moons, and they do not rotate around themselves, neither do they rotate around the Sun, but they move along wandering about in the space. \n \u0095 They are relatively small objects, and will get colder by time, and their heads may then become a group of hot rocks. \n \u0095 They are more numerous than what one may think, but most of them are hiding and invisible; because of their relatively small volumes and particular sort of movement. \n \u0095 The tail following the head of the comet, being attracted to it by gravitation. The tail does not propel the comet, and there is no jet propulsion; on the contrary, sometimes the tail is in front of the head. The tail direction is always away from the sun. \n \u0095 The comet is very hot and flaming; its tail may include water vapor, but there is no ice in the comet. \n \u0095 The comet has affinity to the cold and freezing regions of the Earth (and other planets), and has repulsion with the hot objects like the Sun. \n \u0095 When a comet falls on the ground, it will melt the stone and dig in the surface to be buried under the ground; this is in comparison with the meteorite which when falls, will remain above the ground. Usually, the falling comet will lead to the formation of a crater. Its falling will cause burns, storms and quaking of the earth, and will destroy a wide area. \n \u0095 Life did not come to the Earth embedded in the comets, but in the meteorites; because comets are flaming objects, and fire kills the living cells. \n For more information about the comets refer to our website:\n \n eanassir.\n\n \n dude..... I want whatever you Muslims are smoking......",

   "It says in that quote that 1. comets are shot out of the sun and 2. the tail of the comet is attracted to the head by gravitation..... but then it admitted that the tail always points away from the sun. In fact there are so many contradictory statements ALL of which were believed at the time and states nothing that a 'creator' would know that wasn't believed by contemporaries. What tripe. How could anyone think that this stuff comes from 'the mouth of God'. Its so blatantly obvious.",
