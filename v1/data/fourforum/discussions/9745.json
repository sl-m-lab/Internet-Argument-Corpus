   "Does 50 Cent have the national platform that Imus has?\n\n \n 50 Cent certainly has a platform on the level of Imus. His albums have reached the top of the charts, and he's won multiple Grammy awards. And so, it would appear that 50 Cent has quite a large audience.\n \n \nThat's the main problem. And, I wouldn't be too surprised if rappers were not pressured to cut the #### in their lyrics as a result of the Imus dustup.\n\n \n Sure they might be pressured. But will they be pressured equally? If Imus' remarks are deserving of a protest and a resignation/firing, than surely 50 Cent's are as well.\n \n Note, I am not suggesting Imus should be let off the hook. I am only suggesting that Sharpton is unprincipled.\n \n \nThere are going to be all kinds of changes in our cultue as a result of Imus' flapping mouth. We might even be able to shut up the even more racist mouths of Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, et al. I don't think they should be banned from the airwaves but they should be humiliated and made examples of, just as Imus was.\n\n \n Are they racist merely because you say so? Frankly, I don't listen to talk radio, but I wonder if you can back that up.",

   "There is a difference between being politically correct to rediculous lengths, and being culturally and racially sensitive. Calling someone a \"spokesperson\" rather than a \"spokesman\" simply because they are female is rediculous. Calling a group of black females \"nappy headed ho's\" is simply wrong, and I can't understand how it is being \"overly sensitive\" when people complain about it. \n \n If being culturally and racially sensitive causes other nations to hate us, so be it. I would rather be hated by ignorant people for being decent than hated by decent people for being ignorant.\n\n \n Perhaps it did hurt the feelings of the Rutgers basketball team and thus an apology should be said to them. However, calling for him to resign and making a deal deal about it makes it seem like our country is over senstive. \n \n Honestly, have you never said something that was mean? Have you never said something mean while working? If not you are a liar and if so should you be fired? Does this change because Imus is more well known? All of a sudden a more well known figure means the comments are worse? That makes no sense.\n \n Finally, if you listen to talk radio, normal music radio, and TV for more than a week you will hear 10 times as many mean comments.\n \n Believe it or not, Ann Coulter got it right. He probably should apologize to the Rutgers team and them only. Why? Because many people heard it and it was a story that was well known and thus the Rutgers players were in the middle of it out of no where. He shouldn't have to apologize to Al Sharpton or anyone else for that matter and certainly shouldn't be fired for, as Charles Barkley said, \"saying one stupid comment\".",

   "On behalf of a grateful nation, I would like to thank Messrs Imus and Sharpton for keeping the Anna Nicole Circus from returning to the airwaves. \n \n According to Arbitron ratings Imus has approximately 3.5 million listeners. \n \n 50 Cent has sold 21 million albums. That means 50 cent has had the opportunity to influence six times the listeners as Mr. Imus. \n \n But that does not consider how many songs have been purchased/downloaded, ipodded or whatever the hell kids do these days. To my knowledge, the self-proclaimed I-Man is not doing a bank o' business on I-tunes. I am also assuming that when 50 cent refers to \"bitches\", he is not referring to a kennel club. Perhaps I am wrong in that regard.\n \n So what do these knuckleheads have in common? Here's the bottom line: They may say whatever the hell they want to say about anyone they wish, in accordance with the approval of their audience. These people are media personalities. Their job is to get and hold your attention long enough for some company to schlep its products. Perceived racism, sexism, regionalism, whateverism will only be a factor as it impacts that audience. 50 Cent's audience has no problem with that artist's misogyny. Don Imus (gasp) is a shock jock. Guess what he does for a living? Indeed, one of the first actions the Rev. Al took was to book Imus on his radio show. Why? Ratings. Did ye honestly know that Rev Al had a radio show? Thanks to Imus, ye do now. Rev Al knows that racism and sexism sell. He and 50 cent make money off different sides of the same coin. All of them will follow the money.\n \n These comments were made by an angry old coot against 10 basketball players. Thus, the matter is ideally for 11 folks to decide. I do not believe there are many in Imus's audience who will depart from his crusty cantakery over one questionable comment. They have heard far worse comments, not the least of which being his endorsement of Sen. John Kerry for President.",

   "Not true. I have heard George Carlin use the word \"nigger\" about a hundred times in his shows. He get's laughs, from both whites and blacks, and I cannot recall one instance when I have heard people complaining about it. Chris Rock also uses the word \"nigger\" quite frequently, and he also gets laughs and does not offend people. \n \n Actually, Carlin talks about this very issue in one of his routines. He states that it is not the usage of the word itself that is offensive, it is the context that the word is used in. Words are simply words, neither good or bad. It is the context that makes the word and its usage derogatory. A person of any color can use any word in a derogatory context and offend people...even people of his own race.\n\n I'm a big fan of George Carlin, but I've never ever heard him (or any other white comedian) say \"nigger\". Not that I'm saying that you're dishonest or anything.

   "From the Wall Street Journal and Lionel Tiger, no less:\n \n The 'H' Word\n By LIONEL TIGER\n April 12, 2007; Page A14\n What Don Imus failed to recognize in his puerile fatuity about the Rutgers women's basketball team is the intimacy of college athletics, and hence its hot importance to the inner lives of everyone concerned with it. I've not had members of the current team in any of my classes. But I've taught other varsity athletes and there is something clear-cut and rich when you see them moving especially slowly to enter a classroom because you know they had a trying game the night before and their bones hurt.\n \n When, at the beginning of a semester, they present for signature the schedule of their away games so that their absences are acceptable, it becomes clear how hard the good ones work, how keenly they evaluate their own results, and how sharply they are able to separate the carnival of public success and failure from the private experience of their own effort. When a student describes leaving his dorm for a winter practice at 5 a.m. while fellow students are still returning from parties, it becomes clear that the personal costs of athletic achievement are measured out on a daily basis.\n \n So when Imus made his improbably ugly comment, he could not anticipate how many people were heartbroken that he turned a vibrantly decent moment of celebration and joy for the team, their coaches and supporters into confrontation with a national pathology.\n \n And of course national pathology it is. Pressing the Race and Sex buttons always gets a response from the media machine and the garrulous shepherds of the diversity flock. Mr. Imus's views on the decor habits of women with dark skin and very curly hair are condescending, pedestrian and of no interest except as a symptom of the lens he uses with which to see other people. But it's his use of the \"H\" word which is most significant, and herein lies an anthropological story.\n \n Perhaps because I was raised in Victorian Canada, I have always found the casual use of the H word perplexing, offensive and violent. Whatever its etymological derivation, the fact is that it's understood to be shorthand for \"whore.\" The term appears to have achieved currency and seeming acceptability initially and mainly in the community of people with dark skin. Just take a look -- if your stomach is settled -- at any number of MTV video spectacles of Rapper Princes surrounded by wholly compliant and nearly nude women grinding their lives away. But this is of course no alibi at all for any people with any pigment to describe any woman or group of women in a manner which deprives them of their sexual autonomy and paints them with the sign \"commodity for purchase.\"\n \n The thoughtless use of such language is bad enough. Far worse is the situation which provoked and appears to support it -- the comparative ineffectiveness of some African-American males in achieving stable and rewarding statuses in the wider society.\n \n Perhaps as a dramatic antidote, that culture has produced a galaxy of tight-rope heroes embedded in the largest black or white SUVs with a weapon on the floor as they float from misogynist performance to performance. They and their managers have not had to endure sermons from Rev. Al Sharpton and don't get threatened with losing their record contracts or concert venues.\n \n The coercive trend is that ordinary African-American males earn decreasing amounts of money compared to women of their community. They are more accident-prone, more imprisoned and have frailer family lives than women do. Is this why they smoothly call them whores, out of desperate resentment at their own ineffectuality?\n \n There are structural reasons for this beyond the craven crumminess of popular culture. When African and Arab slavers captured people for the New World, they preferred to break up families. Subsequent slave-owning policies sustained that pattern. As well, many slaves were taken from West African societies in which biological mothers and fathers didn't necessary share child caretaking but mother and her brother did. When I lived in Ghana years ago, Christian families with father and mother in the household were called \"same muddah same fadduh\" in the street. It's likely that continuities persist, as they certainly do in Caribbean societies.\n \n There's also a massive contemporary reason for the invidiousness many African-American men feel in the presence of women -- their relative failure in a school system which broadly favors females. By college age, there is a sharp fall-off of male enrollment in general and of African-American men specifically.\n \n When Don Imus meets with the Rutgers women, as they agreed he can, it is doubtful he will have the bravery or stupidity to call them whores to their troubled faces. He was after all an unelected representative of a broader culture when he used That Phrase.\n \n Nevertheless, for those of us in the Rutgers community, these are our accomplished young women, whatever their color. In their stately tearjerker news conference on Tuesday, they conducted themselves with discreet dignity and care. And to a woman they called him Mr. Imus.\n \n Mr. Tiger is a professor of anthropology at Rutgers University and the author of \"The Decline of Males\" ( St. Martin's Press, 2000).",

I'm disappointed in the way things have played out after he said it. I don't agree with everything Pat Buchanan says, but I think he hit the nail on the head here ...\n \"Compare, if you will, what was done to them - a single nasty insult - to the savage slanders for weeks on end of the Duke lacrosse team and the three players accused by a lying stripper of having gang-raped her at a frat party. Duke faculty and talking heads took that occasion to vent their venom toward all white \"jocks\" on college campuses. Where are the demands for apologies from the talk-show hosts, guests, Duke faculty members and smear artists, all of whom bought into the lies about those Duke kids - because the lies comported with their hateful view of America? And hate is what this is all about. While the remarks of Imus and Bernie about the Rutgers women were indefensible, they were more unthinking and stupid than vicious and malicious. But malice is the right word to describe the howls for their show to be canceled and them to be driven from the airwaves - by phonies who endlessly prattle about the First Amendment. The hypocrisy here was too thick to cut with a chainsaw. What was the term the I-Man used? It was \"hos,\" slang for whores, a term employed ad infinitum et ad nauseam by rap and hip-hop \"artists.\" It is a term out of the African-American community. Yet, if any of a hundred rap singers has lost his contract or been driven from the airwaves for using it, maybe someone can tell me about it. If the word \"hos\" is a filthy insult to decent black women, and it is, why are hip-hop artists and rap singers who use it incessantly not pariahs in the black community? Why would black politicians hobnob with them? Why are there no boycotts of the advertisers of the radio stations that play their degrading music? Answer: The issue here is not the word Imus used. The issue is who Imus is - a white man, who used a term about black women only black folks are permitted to use with impunity and immunity. Whatever Imus' sins, no one deserves to have Al Sharpton - hero of the Tawana Brawley hoax, resolute defender of the fake rape charge against half a dozen innocent guys, which ruined lives - sit in moral judgment upon them. \"It is our feeling that this is only the beginning. We must have a broad discussion on what is permitted and not permitted in terms of the airwaves,\" says Sharpton. It says something about America that someone with Al's track record can claim the role of national censor. Who is next? And why do we take it? I did a bad thing, but I am not a bad person, says Imus. Indeed, whoever used his microphone to do more good for more people - be they the cancer kids of Imus Ranch, the families of Iraq war dead now more justly compensated because of the I-Man or the cause of a cure for autism? \"We know of no spectacle so ridiculous as the British public in one of its periodic fits of morality,\" said Lord Macaulay. Unfortunately, Macaulay never saw the likes of the Revs. Sharpton and Jackson. Imus threw himself on the mercy of the court of elite opinion - and that court, pandering to the mob, lynched him. Yet, for all his sins, he was a better man than the lot of them rejoicing at the foot of the cottonwood tree.\" (http://www.worldnetdaily.com/staticarticles/article55179.html)",

   "And here's an article by a woman who puts this situation into proper perspective I think.\n \n http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55173\n \n Mob gives Imus the ol' heave-ho\n \n Posted: April 13, 2007\n 1:00 a.m. Eastern\n \n The future of Don Imus' nationally syndicated CBS radio show clearly hinged less on Les Moonves, CBS' chief executive, than on a lynch mob led by the Reverends Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. CBS fired Imus, after MSNBC dropped its TV simulcast of the \"Imus in the Morning\" radio program, because the broadcaster had referred to the predominantly black Rutgers women's basketball team as \"nappy-headed hos.\" \n \n The media monolith, pitchforks hoisted, has conducted a swift public trial meant to make an example of Imus and serve as a warning to all others who fail to march in lockstep. In solidarity with the offended women, members of the chattering class have been tripping over one another to show-off their suppurating stigmata. We heard from weatherman Al Roker, Whoopi Goldberg, Maya Angelou, Amy Holmes, Naomi Wolf - all spoke with one voice (so much for diversity). With few exceptions, everybody demanded that Imus be silenced, fired, retired. So said the National Association of Black Journalists. \n \n Extolled as the best this nation has to offer, the young players held a somber press conference, during which they honed the art of taking offense. Faces grim, the girls were as charitable as the Politburo. \"They had not decided whether they would accept Mr. Imus' apology,\" they informed the press. All they knew was that they had been \"scarred for life\"; that theirs was the collective howl of wounded womanhood. \"All of our accomplishments were lost, our moment was taken away,\" the women intoned. \n \n Said Essence Carson, the captain of the team: \n \n Not only has Mr. Imus stolen a moment of pure grace from us, but he has brought us to the harsh reality that behind the faces of the networks. They have worked so hard to convey a message and empowerment to young adults that somehow, some way the door has been left open to attack your leaders of tomorrow.\n Come again? Although the speeches of both black and white spokeswomen were short on grammatical English and long on banalities and clich\u00e9s, everyone and his dog praised the girls for their extraordinary eloquence. \n \n An old git utters an ugly utterance, and these \"strong\" and sinewy women are stripped of \"all that they had worked for, all that they sacrificed for\"? Oh the hyperbole! Whatever happened to sticks and stones and all that? What about rising above the fray? Turning the other cheek? Not milking a situation tackily for all its worth? Where's the Christian forgiveness in all this? Were these athletes my daughters, I'd have advised them to lighten up, tell Gramps to get a grip, and get back to the game. \n \n The next stop on their Via Dolorosa is Oprah, naturally. \n \n Just so his fans know he's on the side of the angels, the insufferably sanctimonious Keith Olbermann, host of MSNBC's \"Countdown,\" made sure to divulge he had been agitating behind the scenes for Imus' removal. Olbermann then let Jesse Jackson of \"Hymietown\" fame (and friend to Louis Farrakhan) shake down MSNBC on air. I was unable to decipher Jackson's word salad, bar the demand for more black anchors and hosts on the network. \"Where were all the black talk-show hosts,\" Jackson wanted to know? \n \n Well, the one I liked most was axed by MSNBC: WND columnist Alan Keyes. Other than being overeducated, Keyes displayed a lamentable lack of tolerance for Palestinian suicide bombers. His show was terminated shortly after a magnificent display of moral outrage at the \"existential meaning of painstakingly - almost lovingly - packing parcels of shrapnel, ball-bearings, nails and rat poison, to lodge in the bodies of Israeli civilians,\" as I wrote in a 2002 column. \n \n Al Sharpton as the nation's moral arbiter: now that's a preposterous notion. Tawana Brawley anyone? The Crown Heights Riot? The first was a version of the Duke lacrosse libel, where a black girl, carefully coached by Sharpton, Nifonged a district attorney and some innocent police officers. Sharpton never retracted the rapist and racist epithets he slung at the falsely accused. The last saw Sharpton help incite an anti-Jewish riot, after a rabbi's motorcade accidentally ran over a black boy. Consequently, a young Jew was lynched by a mob chanting \"kill the Jew.\" Sharpton, a bent and brutal man with vengeance on his mind, was impenitent. \n \n I cringed when self-styled Jewish leaders like Abe Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League leapt into denazifying mode following Mel Gibson's anti-Jew petit mal. But this latest Sharpton-and-Jackson-led reign of terror has made Foxman look as genteel and sedate as an English squire. \n \n When in doubt about the latest media-fanned contagion, check with satirist Jon Stewart. He usually gets it. (And no, he's not a left-liberal; Stephen Colbert is. Stewart is a super smart left-libertarian, equally scathing about the left, the right and most of all, the media.) After announcing the winner in the media-manipulated Anna Nicole Smith paternity sweepstakes, Stewart set about placing the Imus burlesque in perspective. \n \n \"An off-hand remark uttered by an elderly man on the radio deserves nothing less than our full-team coverage,\" he quipped sarcastically, summoning the Daily Show's \"senior black correspondent\" and \"senior woman correspondent.\" The delicious Samantha Bee also pronounced herself expert on all things ho. A knuckle dragging, date rapist correspondent weighed in for balance. As Stewart noted, Imus had donned his contrition shades and tried to apologize, but when that didn't work, \"it was time for page two of the white-celebrity-struggling-with-racism playbook: sitting down with Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson.\" \n \n But that failed, too. And that's something not even Stewart could have predicted.",

So why was this comment mean and offensive? Because the Rutgers players took it that way after it had been thrown in their face. Was it hate filled and meant to degrade the basketball team? No, it was a bad joke done in the moment. So the solution is to apologize to the team and move on. Making it out to be a racist and sexist comment is a bit much and to have him fired over it is just extreme. \n \n In the end, a mean comment is a mean comment no matter if 4 people hear it or 4 million.

   "It wouldn't matter on the radio or not. A massively racist comment would be one that is hate filled such as saying \"black people are ignorant lazy good for nothing slobs\". I'd find that pretty racist.

Some jobs, sure, maybe. But not most. Why? Because \"nappy headed ho's\" is racist and sexist! Say it, or something like it enough times, have a managerial atmosphere that allows it, and I'm no lawyer, but I think a black woman working there would have grounds for a harassment case re \"a hostile environment\".

He might even tell you it wasn't meant to degrade, not meant to be offensive, that it was not even his opinion, just fact. And then he'd trot out statistics to \"prove\" it.

I wonder why not?\n \n ww\n\n \n You're obviously not familiar with \"The Fighting Whities\" I see. \n \n \n\n \n 'Fightin' Whities' Cash in on Controversy\n \n By Dana Williams | Staff writer, Tolerance.org \n Jan. 23, 2003 -- When members of the University of Northern Colorado's intramural basketball team named themselves the \"Fightin' Whities\" last year, they were hoping to make a point. They ended up making a whole lot more. \n \n The UNC team adopted the \"Fightin' Whities\" name after an unsuccessful attempt to get nearby Eaton High School to drop the use of a loin-cloth clad caricature for its team, \"Fighting Reds.\" \n \n The satirical move set off a media frenzy and requests poured in for shirts, hats and other merchandise bearing the \"Fightin' Whities\" name and slogan, \"Everythang's gonna be all white.\" \n \"We never really thought anything would become of it,\" said Jeff Van Irwarden, a senior on the basketball team and manager of the T-shirt campaign. \"We just wanted to send a message to Eaton by doing the same thing they had done. But it really went beyond anything we could have ever expected.\" \n \n Internet sales of the T-shirts and hats, featuring the team name, slogan and a caricature of a grinning white guy, have raised more than $125,000 to be used as scholarship money for Native American students at UNC. \n VanIrwarden says the team - made up of white, Native American and Hispanic students - didn't initially set out to make a profit from its new name. \n \n \"We were just trying to send a message at first. But when the media calls starting coming and we saw that people wanted to get shirts and were willing to pay money for them, we decided to put together the T-shirt campaign and the scholarship foundation.\" \n \n More than 15,000 shirts and hats have been sold, with proceeds placed in an endowment for two scholarships per year. VanIrwarden says he expects the first scholarship to be awarded this fall. \n Others are cashing in on the controversy too. \n \n Last fall a local brewery announced a new Fightin' White Wheat beer. Management at Smiling Moose Brew Pub and Grill says the new wheat beer with a hint of orange peel and coriander has gained a loyal following. \n \n And across the country, activists in the fight against racist mascots are taking notice of the \"Fightin' Whities'\" success. \n \n \"They are really doing a good job of making a point,\" said Jen Tayabji, a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"They're getting a lot of attention and getting people who might not have been interested in the issue to start thinking about it.\" Tayabji is a member of the university's Progressive Resource Action Cooperative, which is spearheading its own movement against UIUC's mascot, Chief Illiniwek. \n \n But VanIrwarden admits not everyone who purchases \"Fightin' Whities\" merchandise does so because they understand or identify with the cause. Many people, he says, just think it's funny. The team has even received merchandise requests from white supremacists. \n \n \"It's hard to show the majority what it's like to be discriminated against,\" said VanIrwarden. \n \n One visitor to the message board at the \"Fightin' Whities\" Web site put it this way: \n \n I think that the white community is not offended because it sits in the position of being the MAJORITY racial group and does not feel threatened. Most whites do not know what it feels like to be a minority in a community. They cannot thus feel threatened by being inundated with cultural hypocrisy thrown in their faces.\n Another post by someone identifying himself as \"One Tall White Boy,\" further illustrates the depth of the debate: \n \n I think its hilarious that someone thought this would be offensive... I think its great. I am white and love it!! This is a support! As far as the Indian MASCOTS, give me a break. If I was Indian I would be thrilled to have my culture be the center of a professional football team... I am going to buy a fighting whitie T-shirt, wear it with pride along with my Cleveland Indian Hat and Washington Redskin Boxers!\n \n\n Unfortunately for them, white people got a kick out of it and the school was flooded with requests for Fighting Whities jerseys. The demand was so great that cafepress was commissioned to provide the T-shirts. The proceeds went towards scholarships. \n http://www.cafepress.com/fightinwhite/106",

Please explain black on black racism...and just why do you mention only blacks and whites?...there are numerous other races suffering from racism.\n \n Scared and ignorant is hardly a true description of those who are opposing the terrorists. Without the efforts to discover what the maniacal Muslim deviants are planning, there'd have been many more innocent deaths by now. Clandestine surveilance is required in this effort. I'm convinced the ignorance here belongs to you. If you leave these people alone, they will convert or kill you. These people 'hate our guts' because we are not all Muslims. Why hellfire, they even kill each other for not being the right kind of Muslim.\n \n This country has done a lot more than just persecute people.\n \n We did indeed mistreat the natives here, we did not start the practice of slavery. Blacks sold blacks to anyone who would buy them long before the colonization of America began. We're not killing every Muslim we can find. Many of us have Muslim friends. There are several at my company. There are about 2300 mosques in the US with some 400 of them being run by radical E-mommys (or whatever thy're called) preaching death to all non-Muslims. It's only these radical Muslims that need to be killed...unless of course you'd like to sit down over a cup of tea and convince them of their error in demanding our conversion to Islam. Good luck, buddy! It ain't gonna happen.\n \n Racism exists everywhere. That doesn't make it right, but it redirects your comments to all countries.",

   " The source is RADICAL ISLAM. That is, radical Muslims within the large group of people that we know as Muslims.\n I doubt that your Muslim friends are radical Muslims. I have several Muslim friends also. I work with several Muslims daily. They are fine people.\n \n On a large sheet of paper, draw a large circle to include all Muslims. Within that circle draw a very small circle to include all radical Muslims.\n \n Now take a pair of scissors and cut the small circle out of the paper, place it in an ashtray and set it afire.\n \n My proposed killing of all radical Muslims should be embraced by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. It would be like removing a deadly cancer from the Muslim community. There have been occasions where good Muslims have aided in the fight against bad Muslims. Muslims are not stupid people. It is the small percentage of Muslims that I call radical (those who preach that death should come to all non-Muslims) that I propose to kill.\nOk, but that's not what you said. You proposed the killing of 'radical Muslims', 'those who support them' and 'their children'. Now assuming we go by the definition of 'radical Muslim' being those advocating death to those who disagree with them, who are, exactly, 'those who support them'? Obviously they can't approve of murder as if they did they would fall into the 'radical' category. Therefore you are advocating the killing of people who are not advocating killing themselves. How is this justifiable?\n \n \nCertainly there would be a lower limit to the age of children that would need to die in this effort to disinfect the world of such a radical agenda. You may suggest an age. I suspect it would best be less than six. The cowardly Taliban recently sent a six year old suicide bomber to do their dirty work.\nErr. How can I argue this? If you really think that it is justified to murder children over six because of their parents' beliefs then you are every bit as bad as a 'radical Muslim'.\n \n \nI think it is stupid, irresponsible and reprehensible to attempt appeasement of the sworn lunatics I call redical Muslims. Their intent is that you convert or die. I shall not convert. I shall not stand idly by while they sneak more bombs into the public.\nI don't support appeasement. I also don't support calling for the murder of people who are not themselves committing crimes because of their beliefs. That is what the radical Muslims are doing, and that is what you are doing.",

Obviously they can't approve of murder as if they did they would fall into the 'radical' category. Therefore you are advocating the killing of people who are not advocating killing themselves. How is this justifiable?\nThere is a number of logical errors in the above analysis. Begin where you say, obviously. Then again where you say, therefore. \n \n Those who advocate conversion or death would be those who preach openly for it. Those who support them would be those who may not speak out in public but who do give to the cause, knowing that whatever they are providing will help the cause. \n \n Though you arrived at it by false logic, you do state correctly that I am advocating the killing of people who are not advocating killing themselves. Brave Osama and all the Brave E-Mommys preaching death to infidels all want SOMEONE ELSE to strap on the bombs. They do not advocate killing themselves. They advocate having some of their stupid sheeple kill themselves in order to kill infidels. If Wussy Osama and his following of Wussy E-Mommys really practiced what they preached, they would have killed themselves already.\n \n\n Err. How can I argue this? If you really think that it is justified to murder children over six because of their parents' beliefs then you are every bit as bad as a 'radical Muslim'.\nAdding their children to the list merely makes it more likely that 200 years or so will pass before radical Islam raises its demented head again. Their children are brainwashed early to believe in the glory of becoiming a 'holy warrior' for the Jihad. A Muslim reporter stated that a 5 year old boy proudly proclaimed that very thought during her visit to their village. Getting rid of them is just a form of insurance.\n \n \n \n\n I don't support appeasement.\nWhat action do you support in regard to radical Islam?\n \n \n\n I also don't support calling for the murder of people who are not themselves committing crimes because of their beliefs.\n \n That is what the radical Muslims are doing, and that is what you are doing.\nWould you like to wait until they kill a big crowd of people and then prosecute them in a court of law? Who are you going to prosecute? The bomber likely blew himself to bits? The supplier of the bomb will likely be unknown to you after the bomb goes off. The inspirational leader who talked the bomber into killing himself will have not (by your way of thinking) committed a crime.\n \n So...you'll be dead...along with half your family and many other innocent people...simply because you don't have the balls to kill the bastards who are seriously threatening to kill us all.",
