I never said Planned Parenthood didn't perform abortions. Of all the services provided by planned Parenthood Abortion services accounts for 3% of the overall services offered. They also perform breast screenings, pap smears, STD testing and treatment, and many other necessary health benefits for millions of Americans. The GOP/Teabaggers want to eliminate the entire program funding and they are using Abortion as their tool, by compounding the numbers and lying to the People.
