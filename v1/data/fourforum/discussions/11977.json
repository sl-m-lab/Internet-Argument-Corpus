I find myself blessed to be a part of this moment in history. LA had 30-40000 alone! I went to a protest in riverside because I couldn't get to LA cause of all the fires. As I write this I will post more updates on the results of the protest and such. To all who participated thank you! thank you for standing up for civil rights and equality.",
