   "  Inmates used ingenuity to take guns, pot from cops \n JACKSON, Miss. - Stealing 90 pounds of pot and 16 guns from a Mississippi police department took ingenuity and several prison inmates -- and the police chief says he's relieved that guilty pleas in the case have lifted a cloud of suspicion from his agency. \n \n \"I'm just glad this has lifted a black eye from the police department,\" Greenwood Police Chief Henry Purnell said. \"At one time, people thought police officers took the guns.\" \n \n The last of eight suspects indicted on federal charges in the case -- including several inmates, a janitor and a county road employee -- pleaded guilty Monday. \n \n Authorities say prisoners stole the marijuana from an evidence vault and later took 11 pistols and five machine guns from a locked closet. Authorities say most of the guns, if not all, ended up in Chicago. ....\n \n In September 2005, Lowery and McGee, a 42-year-old inmate serving six years on a cocaine charge, figured out a way to get into a locked closet by removing a ceiling tile in an adjacent room, according to a 16-page federal indictment.\n \n ..... John Camp Smith, allegedly stole five Colt M-16 machine guns from the closet. .... Eight of the pistols and one of the machine guns were found in Chicago, mainly during traffic stops, Purnell said. \n",
