Remember, the overwhelming consensus is that there IS global warming, NOT that it's mostly human-caused (which is really what the debate is about). Not to mention the fallacious reasoning that funding by an oil company is automatically grounds for dismissal of credibility in the first place.\n \n I also think that support for global warming theories has a lot to do with locality and culture probably more so than religious conviction--Europe has been largely behind it for years, and evangelicals simply aren't very common there by comparison. IOW, it could very well be that he CoE and Catholics often fall on that side of the debate because of their countrys' cultures, and Europe is overwhelmingly Catholic, Lutheran, or CoE. , after all. The U.S. culture is very different in regards to global warming--it has no 'old world' history and tends to be politically and culturally conservative to begin with.",

Of the 75% that did, ALL of them concurred that humans were causative. That's 100%.\n\n \n There are 3 different ways to look at the global warming debate:\n 1.) Whether or not there IS global warming;\n \n 2.) Whether or not humans are a causative factor;\n \n 3.) Whether or not humans are enough of a causative factor (among natural causes) to warrant enormous change in human activity.\n Your study indicates 1 and 2 (unsurprisingly), both of which natually most people are going to go with. Humans are on the planet--they are going to have SOME influence, even if it's small compared to other causative influences. What your study completely fails to address is the 3rd (and probably most important) debate: the degree of human causality to what extent that influence is causing the warming.\n \n It does no good to look at issues like this in terms of absolutes pretending that counts as some sort of significant victory on an issue like this--of course most everyone agrees the earth is getting warmer; and of course most everyone agree that humans natually contribute to some degree.

They now agree with you because they are being pro-science, not the other way around. They weighed the facts and they are convinced now. Science now needs to change to determining extent. It is not enough to simply stop there, and say \"humans contribute, that's all we need to know.\" The 3rd issue involves changing the way we do things, and to what extent, so eople need to know how much is necessary, not just a blanket statement that \"humans contribute to global warming.\" That doesn't really do a lot of good, at the end of the day. For instance, I remember reading a recent study saying that a lot more ozone depletion is taking place due to livestock methane emissions from their waste, than industry and automotives.\n \n The fact these evangelicals have come over to the global warming side of the debate is not significant because it demonstrates any victory on anyone's part. Few people disagree that the earth is getting warmer. It is significant because it demonstrates that there are evangelical leaders that are not always anti-science as they are sometimes portrayed.",

Human cause CO2 emissions, which are quantifiable. These CO2 emissions have a quantifiable effect on the proportion of radiation that is reflected back to Earth (I can go into the physics of this if you like, it's just basic quantum theory), and that radiation has a quanitifable effect on temperature.\n \n Current evidence suggests that the earth is the warmest it has been for 12000 years. More importantly though, CO2 levels are higher than they have been in 800000 years and, once again, the rate of change is much higher - CO2 levels in the atmosphere are rising roughly 60 times as fast as at any point in those 800000 years.",
