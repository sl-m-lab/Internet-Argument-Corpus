   "500,000 people in Beirut demonstrated against the pull-out of Syrian troops from Lebanon and against US insistence that those Syrian troops leave Lebanon. That's from a population of 3.5 million. The White Housed shrugged and stated Syria must remove their troops, basically stating that the US knows what's best for Lebanon regardless of what the people of Lebanon feel and think. Once again we're picking on small, defenseless nations in our quest to spread democracy. \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/afp/20050308/pl_afp/lebanonsyriademous_050308153921",
