What I have wondered is does the \"white bearded dude\" mostly work with that uncertainty. Evolution depends totally on chance, and entropy (oversimplification admitted). If a large enough rock hits the earth the evolutionary model breaks into chaos, and the rules change.\n \n If God erodes chance by manipulating uncertainty it is creation, regardless if it had an \"intelligent design\", or not. I wonder why theologies don't argue this most often. I guess Casino Creationism is not sexy either.",
