But it's hard to see that when you have your persecution complex on full force.\n Read your posts and AA's posts, then tell me why you think you shouldn't be argued against.

I bash religion sometimes myself and I'm definitely not atheist or agnostic. I am a Christian.\n \n I bash the pomp and circumstance associated with religions...especially the RCC, the silliest of all Chistian faiths. I bash those who collect riches under the guise of religion and embellish their own lives with it rather than giving it directly to the poor and hungry. I bash all religions for bigotry and refusal to let others believe as they please. (We don't need evangelical saviours anymore than we need the atheists discouraging faith in God.) I believe that in general all the evangelicals want is more contributions to their slush fund.\n \n Some of the bible thumpers go overboard in chastising \"sinners\". Some of the atheists go overboard in criticizing religion. If both groups would just shut the #### up!!!\n \n I think the atheists bash religion because a)they want company, b)they're afraid that we're right and c)they just don't understand what good things a little faith can do whether that which is believed in is real or not.",

   "Dear Anti-Religion People\n \n What do you hope to accomplish by bashing religion? \n\n Labeling someone as \"anti-religion\" or calling it bashing implies there is mindless criticism that has no merit, or criticism for its own sake. That is not taking place. \n \n \nWhat constructive activity do you hope to do by getting on here and saying how wrong religion is? \n\n Um, this is an opinion forum and a religion thread on that forum. If someone raises an issue and my honest response happens to be a criticism of religion, that is the constructive activity. \n \n \n \nDoesn't the first amendment matter anymore? \n\n Yes, of course it does. And that includes the right to speak openly and honestly about religion. Is discussion of religion off-base to you?\n \n \nWhy do you say we're evil? \n \n I don't believe anyone has said that. \n I do not have any sweeping generalizations about any religious person. I have some specific criticisms against you as a person because you refuse to debate logically and mindfully. Evidence of that is this post itself, which contains numerous misunderstandings and mischaracterizations. \n \n \nWhat is wrong with belief?\n\n Belief? Nothing. \n Faith? If defined as the belief in something for which there is no evidence or despite evidence to the contrary, that is a very stupid thing, indeed. \n \n \nWhat is wrong with faith in heaven? \n\n See \"faith\" above. \n There is no heaven.\n \n \n \nYour intent is only to put down others. \n \n Completely untrue.\n My intent to express my opinion about the lunacy of religion.\n \n \n \nWhy do you think you're being smart just by implying that God is evil? \n\n No one thinks they are \"being smart\".\n No one has implied God is evil. A non-existent being has no attributes.\n The mythical god of the bible does some pretty nasty stuff, however.\n \n \nDo you think it's funny? \n\n Nope.\n I think you are.\n \n \n \nDo you need a way to vent your anger? \n\n No anger to vent.\n The only anger I see here is from you and Archie.\n \n \n\n Do you do so by taking it out on people who don't share your beliefs? \n\n No one is taking anything out on anyone. This is a free expression of ideas.\n \n \nYou say there are evil people among religion? As if there are no evil people among atheists? \n\n Of course atheists may also be evil.\n \n \n\n \n What is wrong with faith in heaven? Your intent is only to put down others. \n\n You are repeating yourself.\n \n \nYou look down on us, you say our faith is blind, but why? \n\n I would not hope to \"look down\" on anyone, least of all someone on an internet forum that I do not know. There is no \"US\" ethmi, only a \"YOU\" and you make stupid remarks. It is those remarks that get criticized. \n Are you actually defending \"blind faith\"?\n \n I\nf a guy has cancer, but has faith that he'll survive, I don't think you'd bash him, saying he has blind faith. So why do you bash us? What's the point? \n\n Blind faith is always stupid. I think someone who is dying should have all the facts. There are many decisions to make. One should weigh the likelihood of future events and act accordingly. If someone cannot handle the facts, then maybe unrealistic hope may make them feel better. However, if one completely dismisses the facts and doesn't make the proper preparations for death for himself and his family, criticism of that behavior is warranted. \n \n Not sure how a this relates to religion.\n \n You seem to be missing the point. \n I can't speak for anyone else here, but I think it is harmful to have a taboo against questioning religious beliefs. I think that faith itself is harmful (as defined above, which is utterly distinct from trust and hope). I think that a great deal of harm comes to the world by rigid, intransigent religious ideas such as get expressed by you.",

   "Dear Anti-Religion People\n What do you hope to accomplish by bashing religion?\n\n Are we back to you defining \"bash\" by proclaiming anybody who doesn't agree with your religion is \"bashing\" it?\n \n Quite frankly, some religious people are WAYYYY too quick to take offense, claiming \"bashing\" where none exists.\n This passive aggressive junk may play to a select few, but overall it just gets old and boring.\n \n \n \nWhat constructive activity do you hope to do by getting on here and saying how wrong religion is?\n\n Advancement of a more moral society?\n The bible has no problem with slavery, and actually endorses misogyny. Two examples our society has evolved from.\n Religion also (for the most part) seems to have evolved to the point of tolerating other religions as well.\n \n But there is still room for improvement, and that won't occur without some analysis.

Not ours...\n \n 2) \"evil\"?\n Who the heck are you talking to with that accusation?\n \n 3) Nothing is wrong with belief.\n Who the heck are you talking to with that accusation?\n \n 4) Nothing is wrong with faith in heaven.\n Who the heck are you talking to with that accusation?\n \n \n \nWhy do you think you're being smart just by implying that God is evil? Do you think it's funny? Do you need a way to vent your anger? Do you do so by taking it out on people who don't share your beliefs?\n\n I have to chuckle at this complaint. Purely passive aggressive, while avoiding the actual merits of the argument.\n \n If we had a country leader today who acted half as bad as the Old Testament biblical God, or who promised torture to people who \"didn't believe\" in him, we would rightfully recognize this country leader as \"evil\".\n But when it comes to your God, there is a pretense that he must be ASSUMED to be good, and any evidence to the contrary is ignored. Or else we should it is an \"unknowable will and wisdom\" of God.\n \n As long as you insist that your God must be presumed \"good\" without question, I really don't see how you can level the complaint you just made.\n \n \n \nYou say there are evil people among religion?

What's the point?\nI'm not sure about other countries, but in the U.S. christian bashing has a long tradition. It has gone on as long as there have been European settlers in North America. The Pilgrims, who were Puritans who founded the Congregationalist Churches, bashed every other religion. They banned, banished, and sometimes killed anyone who disagreed with their religion. Any other religion, of course, came from the devil himself. That included Anglicans, Anabaptists, Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Quackers, Roman Catholics and others. And, of course, the favors were returned without exception. Of course the scale of violence in North America never reached that of Europe, where christian bashing (of other sects) broke out in war. Even in England there were at least two civil wars fought in an effort by one christian sect to bash another. They all considered themselves the one true religion. In the mid 1700s the efforts of the Anglican church to depose Congregationalism as the established religion in the New England colonies was very bitter. There was lots of very creative christian bashing by both sides. In New York, the Anglican church tried to establish a state supported university that was Anglican and meant for the preparation of Anglican ministers, just as Harvard and Yale were Congregationalist universities and William and Mary was an Anglican university. All of this christian bashing tired the people to the extent that the antidisestablishment movement became very popular. As a result, the new Constitutions written by the States in 1776 and 1777 did not establish state religions in many colonies. Finally, continued christian bashing by other christians led to the disestablishment of christian religions in all States, ending with Congregationalism as the state religion in Connecticut in the early 1818, and the repeal of preferential laws in Massachusetts in 1833.\n \n Even on this board you can see Jim carrying on a long and honored christian tradition.",

   "Are we back to you defining \"bash\" by proclaiming anybody who doesn't agree with your religion is \"bashing\" it?\n\n \n No. I'm saying anyone who says it's wrong for no reason is bashing it. Bashing: telling people they're wrong for no apparent reason. \n \n \nQuite frankly, some religious people are WAYYYY too quick to take offense, claiming \"bashing\" where none exists.\n This passive aggressive junk may play to a select few, but overall it just gets old and boring.\n\n \n It doesn't \"play\" for those who are too arrogant to see they're own bigotry.\n \n \nAdvancement of a more moral society?\n The bible has no problem with slavery, and actually endorses misogyny. Two examples our society has evolved from.\n Religion also (for the most part) seems to have evolved to the point of tolerating other religions as well.\n\n \n Well, if you know so much more than I do, then why don't you quote something from the Bible that supports that stuff?\n \n \nBut there is still room for improvement, and that won't occur without some analysis. And there will be criticism.\n\n \n What needs improved? Maybe we wouldn't be so angry if you would stop telling us that faith is wrong.\n \n \nPerhaps a better question is what do you hope to do by getting on here and saying how right your religion is?\n\n \n If you would have read my post and thought about it, I didn't say my religion is right. I said you're wrong for bashing it. \n \n \nAnd out parade the strawman arguments.\n 1) Disagreement and opposing view-points are NOT first amendment violations. For the most part, we agree in \"freedom of speech\" around here.\n Who the heck are you talking to with that accusation?\n\n \n I was refering to freedom of religion.\n \n \nThere are some who think it isn't proper when it comes to freely talking about \"gay\" subjects, or books that have a \"gay\" theme, but I think that's a problem on YOUR side of the fence. Not ours...\n\n \n Oh, yeah, sure. You atheists are perfect. You're never wrong about anything whatsoever, are you?\n \n \n2) \"evil\"?\n Who the heck are you talking to with that accusation?\n\n \n You say our faith is blind, that we're ignorant, and how rightouess atheism is. \n \n \n3) Nothing is wrong with belief.\n Who the heck are you talking to with that accusation?\n \n 4) Nothing is wrong with faith in heaven.\n Who the heck are you talking to with that accusation?\n \n\n \n If nothing's wrong with it, then why do you bash it? You say you're not bashing it? I've never seen any posts of yours outside the religion forum.\n \n \nI have to chuckle at this complaint. Purely passive aggressive, while avoiding the actual merits of the argument.\n\n \n Chuckle? That's adding an unneccesary comment, that you always point out to me. Would that make you a hypocrite?\n \n \nIf we had a country leader today who acted half as bad as the Old Testament biblical God, or who promised torture to people who \"didn't believe\" in him, we would rightfully recognize this country leader as \"evil\".\n But when it comes to your God, there is a pretense that he must be ASSUMED to be good, and any evidence to the contrary is ignored. Or else we should it is an \"unknowable will and wisdom\" of God.\n\n \n God didn't promise torture. Hell doesn't exist. I believe in the lake of fire, for those who knew the truth and turned they're back on it. Those who never new the commandments would be judged by their character, while those who turned their back on it, would be judged that way. And country leaders don't create life either.\n \n \nAs long as you insist that your God must be presumed \"good\" without question, I really don't see how you can level the complaint you just made.\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, who the heck are you talking to with all these inane accusations?\n\n \n Almost every |) /\\ |\\/| |\\| anti religion post I've seen pointed out individual events where a religious person shows fanaticism. Look at half of the communist tyrants who claimed religion to be lies!\n \n \nQuite frankly, I don't care what you personally believe in your own life.\n It's when people presume to espouse those beliefs, and enforce those beliefs, upon others that I take exception.\n\n \n I'm not trying to force my beliefs on you. I'm trying to get you to see how you always say how ignorant religion is. To back that up, you say God is Evil, you say \"amusing\" on half of your replies, so as to anger me, and you accuse me of making blind arguments rather than thinking about what they mean, because it's more convinient for you.\n \n \nAnd you should be willing to accept the fact that while you have the right to praise your belief, others have a right to criticize it.\n Freedom of speech is a two-way street.\n And if you can't take the heat, maybe you should consider what your worth is in being in the kitchen...\n\n \n Again, I'm refering to freedom of religion, not freedom of speech. And before you say I'm unamerican or something, I AM in favor of freedom of speech. After all, there are people on the Gun Control forum to debate.",

Before hearing 'The Truth' he was pretty much guaranteed a place in heaven, but now he has to 'believe' or he's gonna have a hot bum for all eternity.\n \n So, if those who never heard 'The Truth' (let's say those who lived before Jesus) are to be judged on their merits, and those who lived later (and had heard) are to be judged on thier 'belief', then can we deduce from this that Jesus came not to save, but to condemn?\n \n Just a thought.\n \n Smiley",

If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter. If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife. If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment. Exodus 21:7-11\n \n Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ. (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)\n Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed. If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful. You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts. Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them. (1 Timothy 6:1-2 NLT)\n \n \n \nWhat needs improved? Maybe we wouldn't be so angry if you would stop telling us that faith is wrong.\n\n 1) \"stop telling us that faith is wrong\"? I never said \"faith\" was wrong.\n And as far as YOUR faith being right or wrong, that's a two-way street.\n There are plenty of your fellow Christians out there telling other people their faith is wrong. Perhaps those Christians should stop \"bashing\" the Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, agnostics, atheists, ...\n \n 2) So you admit to being angry?\n That's a start. Self-reflection is a good way to figure out what can be improved.\n Perhaps a better question would be to ask why me telling you that you're wrong should make you angry in the first place?\n We're all entitled to our opinions.

   "What I find interesting is that although none of you will condemn ALL religions across the board, you all will reject Jesus Christ, the principles of His Gospel and His followers who follow His teachings literally as He commanded.\n\n Not at all. I'm going to go make a topic on this in a minute, but... the only things about Christianity that I reject is the same thing I reject about any religion or worldview - that which I consider to be harmful to human society and progress. The principles of Christ are fine, but the overzealous interpretations of such principles are not, when they do more harm than good. Religious belief has always modified these interpretations to fit the world as it changes - geocentrism went out of the window, 'witches' were no longer burnt at the stake, subjugation of women and slavery were no longer condoned by the bible, and even the Vatican recognises that the earth is significantly older than 6000 years. How do you know, therefore, that your current interpretations are any more correct that theirs were? If what you interpret turns out to be blatantly untrue and/or harmfull, then chances are that you're interpreting it in the wrong way. What did you think of my ideas on Omphalos?\n \n \nSo you see; the cults and the false religions of the world don't offend the natural man at all.

And along with it, the believers who promote and defend that truth as John 1:5 clearly says above.\n\n Firstly, as I've stated before, this argument can be used to rationalise any controversial viewpoint. Out of all the religions of the word, Scientology probably offends me the most, closely followed by hard-right fundamentalism of all faiths. Does this mean that Scientology is God's Word? Fred Phelps could use this argument - it wouldn't surprise me if he does.\n \n Secondly, as mentioned above, I (and most others) don't reject most of the bible. The morals set out by Jesus are good ones, most people-who-aren't-Archangel live by the same. It's merely the insistence, again, that the bible be literally, harmfully interpreted - and only in specific places. 'If a man lies with another it is abomination, he is to be put to death ' is still argued for, but 'anyone who curses their father and mother shall be put to death' is not.",

   "You know what? You can deny your bigotry and say \"We're not bashing religion - we just think that religion has no value.\" all you want. But I know for certain, that not one single one of you would hesitate to call me a bigot if I said \"Homosexuality has no value.\"\n\n emoticon_xdonno \n You think you got EVERYBODY figured out, don't you.\n Why do you even bother to talk to us when you already know what we're going to say?\n \n Regardless of rhetorical questions, you're wrong about what you claim to \"know for certain\". And you're wrong about what many of us think about \"religion\".\n \n 1) I think Christianity DOES have value.\n The whole \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\"? Incredible philosophy.\n And also a LOT of focus on loving other people, INCLUDING your enemies. Pretty potent stuff.\n \n I think it's a little naive in some ways. The \"turn the other cheek\" thing and \"He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword\" seem a little too meek, but that's Jesus's focus.\n \n 2) Regarding \"bigotry\", I've got a simple standard.\n You can have whatever opinion you want. I don't care.\n It's when a person wants to take that opinion and ENFORCE it against others, like in discriminating against others, that I see \"bigotry\".\n \n So, if you think homosexuality \"has no value\", that's your opinion.\n If you think homosexuals should be discriminated against, in my book that's bigotry.\n \n I would welcome a discussion on such a standard, if you disagree, but I doubt you're up for it.\n I suspect you'll just want to whine about the label, instead of discussing whether or not it's accurate...\n \n \n \nWe want to believe, and we want to do it without anti-religion jerks telling us we're wrong. If you set up a family reunion picnic, would you want some snobby kid commenting on how much the food sucks?\n\n There you are with the name-calling again.\n Can you try to take a step back away from emotionality, and ponder the fact that in any disagreement, there is a position where the two involved positions think the other position is wrong?\n \n I could think a house should be painted yellow.\n Janet could think the house should be painted green.\n Janet could think that yellow is the wrong color for the house.\n A person should be able to handle disagreement without feeling diminished by it.\n \n Another way to look at it is this.\n Don't you think WE are wrong in not being Christian? emoticon_wow \n Don't you think atheism, buddhism, etc, etc, are wrong??? emoticon_confused \n \n Should they take it personally cause you don't agree?\n \n \n \nDoes that mean you don't have to be polite to new people you meet?\n\n You repeatedly insult others with names, and then insist on taking offense yourself.\n Your definition of \"polite\" appears to be able to express your religious beliefs WITHOUT CONTRADICTION.\n That kind of double-standard, where you have freedom of religious speech, but others don't have the same to express their beliefs, is \"not polite\".\n \n \n \nWhat's the point in commenting anyhow? When you see fat people, of course you notice, but you don't go up to them and comment about it.\n\n This is a public forum, filled with all sorts of topics and ideas we discuss.\n The WHOLE POINT is that we POST OUR COMMENTS.\n \n If you don't like them, maybe you should realize that \"going up to read about them\" isn't something you're cut out for.\n \n A more accurate description of the situation is that we're all PURPOSELY GOING to a room where the PURPOSE is to discuss \"Weight\".\n There ARE \"fat\" people in the room, and \"skinny\" people, and \"muscular\" people, and \"slim\" people.\n And when people speak out to say why they think their \"weight\" is best and others are not as good, you take offense...\n \n You need to take some steps back and figure out the PURPOSE of these forum boards in the first place.\n If you want to only hear like-minded people, and not have others express a contradictory opinion of your religion, maybe you should google \"Christian forums\" and go there instead.\n I say that because I think it's more in your best interest.",

I don't agree with it, but I'm not going to take someone's world apart for no reason.

It's a wonderful example of a self reinforcing fantasy. Every time evidence is brought against you it reinforces your faith. Luckily these arguments aren't made for your benefit....\n \n \nSo it isn't religion that offends the Natural Man, but it's GODS TRUTH of the GOSPEL that they reject, hate and fight against so fervently. And along with it, the believers who promote and defend that truth as John 1:5 clearly say's above.\n\n \n God's truth clashes with the evidence that you say He put here....
