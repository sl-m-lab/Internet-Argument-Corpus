   "dug, if your mother had abstained, everything that you are composed of right now, would have still existed. all of the matter that makes of your body did not come out of nowhere, it came from the world around you. An important thing to realize, is that you are a particular arrangement of particles of matter. Those particles of matter that make you up now, would have just been somewhere else, arranged differently as countless numbers of other things. That matter became you though, because your parents made it into you by using the facilities that their bodies naturally contain.\n \n When your mother was pregnant with you, the food she ate was processed by her body using chemicals in her digestive tract to render the materials needed to create a person, and then her reproductive system arranged it into you.\n \n Your argument seems to be that this matter became alive at the point of union between the sperm and egg. I don't believe that is necessarily the case, I don't think it becomes alive at a particular point, because the sperm and egg were alive already, as was much of the food that was eaten. But even if it is granted that that point is when it becomes alive, it was still potentially alive before that point but it was abandoned. abandoned by abstinence, by masturbation, by menstruation, or by deciding to eat one thing instead of the other.\n \n And finally, returning to my original point: regardless of when matter becomes life, all matter is potential life and is constantly not given the chance to live. Whether a bunch of matter is arranged into a fetus, given life and abandoned before birth, or never arranged at all, it is never given a chance to live just the same.

If you are, in fact, pro-choice, and at the same time believe that a fetus is a baby, then how does your moral code work? A baby is being murdered, if I understand you're statement correctly, but you will allow that to happen in case somebody wants to do it?

There are only two sides to the abortion issue, and the pro-choicers know that. They use the term as a shield, not as a definition of sides.\n \n You see, those with a moral code who wish to compromise for abortion will not call themselves pro-abortionists because the name says pretty blatantly that they are in favor of allowing babies to be killed (regardless of whether they think a fetus is a baby or not) and they know that looks bad to other people. That's one of the reasons the media almost never uses the term pro-abortionist.\n \n \neven if one accsepts that a baby is a living person with a right to live - its still a person without the ablity to exersize that right - that is, it is not phisicaly capeable of sustaining its own life.

   "Ah, I can understand that DrNo. But I don't think it works that way, and this is why:\n \n You claim that a fetus is no more different from a developed baby than a baby is from a 40 year old. This is legitimate indeed! The difference in both cases is mere degrees of physical and mental development. However, this is equally true of the difference between an unfertilized egg, and a fetus, or a sperm and a fetus for that mater, and it is furthermore equally true of the difference between the food I eat tomorrow morning, and the sperm I produce later that day - and by hypothetical syllogism, the difference between that food and a 40 year old is a mere matter of physical and mental development as well. Some wish to draw a line at conception, some wish to draw a line at brain activity, some wish to draw a line a birth, all of these positions are based upon a persons interpretation of the matter-becoming-a-person at its various levels of development, witch essentially consists of how well the can relate to it, and how they feel about it - as well as their need to draw a line.\n \n You for example, seem to need a line drawn at conception. It is your interpretation, that conception is a significant step in the transformation of disorganized matter into a human being. Believe it or not, that isn't my interpretation, I don't intuitively see that as being more significant than any other step. If you want to argue that position, you are going to have to do more than just insist that it is an objective fact that anybody could see If they looked - its not. You are going to explain what it is about conception exactly that makes it wrong to end the creation of life after conception, but not before.\n\n \n I have thought about this before and the answer is quite simple. The reason I draw the line at conception is because that is the earliest stage where the genetic material you are dealing with will actually grow into a human, if the process is not interfered with. A sperm or egg on its own will not develop into a human, although the genetic materials may be somewhat equivalent. If you were to say that sperm qualifies as life, then using a condom is eqivalent to murder (along with any other activity that ejaculates sperm without the express purpose of reproduction). Also, if an undeveloped egg is equivalent to a living human, then a woman's monthly menstruation cycle would aslo be considered murder. I don't consider these types of actions to be murder. This is why I see conception, the sperms fertilization of the egg, as the logical moment to draw the so-called line.",

Stealing was a common way to obtain a horse in many early indian tribes her in america. It was not considered wrong, nor was the stealer deemed a theif. It was just bad luck for the person who had the horse originally.\n \n -- The Bible was the foundation for the laws prohibiting stealing for any reason.\n \n Murder and killing are two different things. In america, killing in any case is considered murder (Except self-defense). Killing for revenge is considered a right in some places, and even in the Israelite law it stated that killing for revenge was an alloted right. But they aren't allowed period now, and each one is considered murder. \n \n -- Killing is a sin, and was recognized as such when the first American laws were written.\n \n How about the way Justice is served in America? How our system allows any man to speak in a trial even if he is suspected? And things like Freedom of Speech?

   "The Bible was not invented and released on a certain date in A.D. somewhere, Bell. It probably wasn't even called the Bible, they were scriptual laws and history, it wasn't until long after the last book was written that they were compiled and called \"The Holy Bible\". So actually yes, there were laws forbidding such things, and they deamed murder and theft absolute wrongs. \n\n \n What the heck are you talking about?

Guilt is not a given emotion you have to life with. B. No one \"kills their child\" for their own sexual convenience. People have abortions for many reasons. It is complex and varied. I suggest you read up on it. And before you give me the \"I have, and here's some pro-life churchy sites where you can read up on it to\" let me remind you that I have had an abortion and actually know and understand the reasons why women have them, and it's not about sexual freedom. \n \n \nIf abortion is made illegal, then the burden of those pregnancies rests with those who got pregnant by themselves, not those who stopped them from commiting murder. \n\n \n Again, another anti-choicer who does not care about the fetuses/babies/children. Not your problem anymore, now that you've forced pregnancy and mandated childbirth upon pregnant women! You can breathe a sigh of relief. All those unwanted children will be born, and their mothers will still have problems which will filter down negatively into the child's life, but that's not your issue anymore. Tough luck, kids.\n \n Washing your hands of these problems by saying that they aren't yours to worry about anymore is not the way to help the children. I hope you rethink your position and perhaps grow a little empathy.\n \n \nThis isn't a competition, so it will suffice for me to say that I have had sex. I am not denying that sex is enjoyable. Duh. All I am saying is that people need to understand the consequences of sex and they should be prepared to deal with them. When one of the consequences of your actions is the creation of a new life, I don't think eliminating that life should be a viable option. Have you ever heard the expression \"You make your bed, so you should be prepared to sleep in it.\"?\n\n \n Anyone who says \"Duh\" needs to ask for a thesaurus for their birthday.\n \n At any rate, since you've had sex, I hope that you are prepared for parenting! Because everyone who has sex, including 14 year olds, married couples with children already, married couples without children, people who enjoy sex for emotional bonding, people who's birth control fails, etc. are clearly obligated to be parents whether it be for nine months or eighteen years.

They will say that an unexpected pregnancy is detrimental to the mother's mental health and use that as justification for abortion. \n\n \n Those doggone lawyers! They are always making up stuff. Clearly, every woman who has an unwanted pregnancy has no mental health issues regarding it. They are of sound mind and are fully able, mentally and physically, to carry a fetus to term.

Then, as now proposed by many, only the poor and working poor produced unwanted children because they couldn't secure an abortion.\n \n When I read other posters, not you, advocating people of lower classes without financial resources or the potential to acquire them take personal responsibility for emotional sex producing unwanted reproduction, I can't help but wonder how long they've either been naive to a point of immaturity or so delusional even meds can't help. All I see with any entity, state or federal, outlawing abortion is a new tax burden on that portion of society who pays the bulk of personal taxes, not those clamoring to follow a belief system, which, splinter groups aside, is unquestionably the driving force of the majority of those against abortion. \n \n Leaving abortion decisions to states is the correct process as the constitution has no reference to abortion. Unless the new SCOTUS majority decides to use the bent commerce act to step in and ensure states like Georgia and others can track and deny public benefits of any type to any pregnant individual who obtains an abortion in a state where abortion is legal. That would quickly lead to federal legislation against abortion, carving out an entire new federal bureaucracy to care for unwanted reproduction and developing a new social sub-class evading federal monetary collection actions.",

   "A. If you have no conscience, guilt is not a given emotion you have to live with.\n\n \n It sounds like you want women who have abortions to feel guilt, eh? That's showing your conscience. Good one. I want women that have had abortions and feel guilt to get counseling. I want women that have had abortions and feel guilt to seek help. I want women who are pregnant and want abortions to receive comprehensive counseling so that 1. They understand their options better. I want them to see that adoption is a concrete idea, not an abstract one. I want them to see that being a parent is not the end of the world. 2. They have a better support system in place, whether they have an abortion or choose to remain pregnant. 3. They recognize that post-abortion stress and guilt may occur, and are aware of all health risks. 4. They receive health care, regardless of their financial situation. 5. They talk to women who have had abortions, who have done adoption, who have been adopted, who are single parents, joint parents, etc.\n \n What do you want?\n \n \nB. You are denying that abortions are for convenience? Regardless of the various reasons you may come up with, it still boils down to eliminating a perceived burden. By this rationale, I should be able to kill all the people on the road who are in my way as I drive to work in the morning; they are a burden and an inconvenience to me.\n\n \n If all those people are inside your body, and you are their sole life support system, and they have no brain, no consciousness, then go ahead. Apples to apples.\n \n Reasoning that is \"convenience\" to you is not so to others. Reasons of poverty, health, education, etc. may be seen as \"convenience\" to you, but create great problems not only for the mother, but the child you so desire to see the world.\n So you still see them as convenient and it upsets you. I can respect that. However, regardless of how you feel about it, the reasons still exist, and women still have abortions. So how can anti and pro choice people work together to help solve these problems? \n \n No one wins the abortion debate. I don't like abortion, I don't advocate that my friends get abortions, but I would never wish to outlaw it. Until our society recognizes problems women (and therefore their children) face with unwanted pregnancies and does something about it, then abortion must be an option.\n \n \nThis is the problem with today's society. People have tried to separate sex from pregnancy and eliminate any responsibility involved. Sex doesn't require any responsibility and we should all be able to have it freely.

It's not my fault if I get my girlfriend pregnant, so I should be able to end the developing life inside of her. That makes total sense.\n\n \n You've said nothing about the mental health issue you brought up and I refuted. Do you think that women who are pregnant and don't wish to be have no mental health issues surrounding that? How do you address that?\n \n You've said nothing about your earlier claim that people who have sex should be prepared to be parents and I said that that must include 14 year olds who have sex, people who's birth control failed, married couples having sex for the enjoyment of it, perhaps a couple in their 40's with grown children, etc. Should they all be forced to be parents, whether it be for nine months or eighteen years?\n \n You've also said nothing about my reply to your \"you've made your bed, now sleep in it comment\". I said that that comment certainly sounds like you're making being a mother punishment for having sex. Is that how you feel? Should women be punished for having sex by being forced into motherhood, whether it be for nine months or the rest of her life? This is not showing care for the child. Mothers who are forced into pregancy are not going to show the best care for their child, and ultimately, the child will suffer. How are you going to address this?\n \n It's really easy to make abstract claims like \"People have tried to separate sex from pregnancy and eliminate any responsibility involved\" so abortion should be illegal but when faced with reality you might find that your concrete line is now a little dotted. Yes it is killing a developing life. Yes, it is a horrible procedure. What solutions do you have to make the need for abortion be eliminated?\n \n In response to your \"personal responsibility\" comment, sometimes an abortion is taking personal responsibility. Why does taking responsibility only mean continuing a pregnancy to birth? Because that's what you think is morally correct? Do you also think, based upon your above example, that people who smoke should be denied health care for their smoke-related health issues, because that's taking personal responsibility? You smoked, you may now die, and that may effect your...oh, children (could be parentless now!) but you made your bed, now lie in it?",

Just because I wasn't prepared for the broken bones doesn't mean he shouldn't pay for the damages. I don't want anybody interfering with my freedom! I want my money!\n \n \n You're trying to shift the burden of responsibility of the pregnancy from the back of the whiny complainy people who are stuck where they are onto the back of those who are trying to make them live with their own actions and take personal responsbility. \n \n The women don't have to live with their baby. They don't have to care for it, they don't need to support it after it is born, they don't have to do anything with it. It won't affect the child negatively at all. There are people like this family in my church that have adopted two babies already, and there are more couples out there that want to adopt them.

Good for you! \n [It's too bad that you go on to say the last bit I've quoted down below here.] \n \n As far as sexual convenience goes, I am sure that there are some women who have abortions as a form of birth control. I think this is terrible. I still do not think they should be \"forced\" to remain pregnant as a type of punishment for their behavior, but I do think that they should be strongly encouraged to be on some kind of birth control. However, how do you weed these women out? How do you identify them, and do you have any stats on this? I have not personally come across any woman who has multiple abortions who do so as a form of birth control. Abortion is a HUGE, mind racking, large, looming, & momentous decision, and I do not believe many women have them as a form of birth control for their own sexual convenience.\n \n Of course, I don't know what exactly you mean by \"sexual convenience\".\n \n \nOutlawing abortion just for those women is like getting rid of traffic lights because of the few cars that need to rush through in an emergency. Protecting the minority from the majority after all.\n\n \n Do you think that women who have abortions for \"sexual convenience\" are the majority? \n \n [QUOTE]I did not force them to have sex, I did not push them into the rush hour traffic to get hit by a car, I did not help it along.\n ...\n \n You're trying to shift the burden of responsibility of the pregnancy from the back of the whiny complainy people who are stuck where they are onto the back of those who are trying to make them live with their own actions and take personal responsbility. [/QUOUT]\n \n This is exactly the problem. You want to outlaw abortion, and then wash your hands of the problems the little babies will face because of it. The problems will still exist! People will still suffer! You cannot take choices away from them and then forget about it. \n \n And I say again, why does taking \"personal responsibility\" only mean carrying the child to term? It doesn't. It does to you, because that's what's right to you. But for others, taking responsibility means not bringing another unwanted child into the world.\n \n \nThe women don't have to live with their baby. They don't have to care for it, they don't need to support it after it is born, they don't have to do anything with it. It won't affect the child negatively at all. There are people like this family in my church that have adopted two babies already, and there are more couples out there that want to adopt them. Ones that will love them more than their own Mother. \n\n \n They do have to care for it, in your mandated pregnancy and forced childbirth world. They do have to, and they don't have a choice. It will effect the child negatively. Do you think women who are going through an unwanted pregnancy are going to be the best pregnant woman they can be for their child? Do you think they'll spend $ (if they even have it) to go to the doctor, eat right, not take drugs, smoke, drink, etc. How come no one ever addresses this when I bring it up? It's glossed over completely. Not your problem, huh? As long as they have the kid, who cares?\n \n I am glad that there are couples you know that have adopted children. I hope they inspire many people to do the same.\n \n \nI do care for the children, but it seems like you stuck with this idea that irresponsible couples should roam free of taking care of themselves while pro-lifers swallow the medicine that was really meant for them.\n\n \n No you don't care for the kids. You just pushed them all aside when you said, to paraphrase, \"I didn't do it so it's not my problem\" and washed yourself clean of 'blame' for their existence. I have not heard one single idea from you about how you are going to help these kids. I'm not just talking adoption here, either. How are you going to get little crack babies adopted, kids with disabilities, kids of minorities, the kids whose mothers decide to keep even though they are ill prepared to mother them either emotionally, physically, or financially, etc.\n \n \nBell, don't you think these couples should be taking a more serious view on sex? \n\n \n Yes, I think everyone should have a very serious view on sex. Actually, I think many people should be sterilized. Like my next door neighbor, who just has a severe 'domestic violence' incident with his girlfriend who puts up with it. I think he should be sterilized and then beat with large iron rods so he knows what it's like.\n \n \nHaving a pregnancy has its health hazards, and so does birth and abortion.\n \n \n Yes, true.\n \n \nDo you really think that they should be allowed to risk these things simply because they want to have sex? Is it really worth it?\n \n If you aren't prepared to take on the responsibility of being a parent, you aren't prepared to have sex. \n \n\n \n Allowed? Huh? Are you saying that, for example, married couples using birth control shouldn't be \"allowed\" to have sex unless they are prepared to be parents? 14 year olds who have sex are obligated to be parents, whether for nine months or eighteen years? \n \n \nYou don't want to be a mom against your will, don't have sex. That is what sex does.\n\n \n Right, punish those women by forcing them to bear children! Right on! That's what's best for women, their children, the fetuses, the fathers, and society. What a great way of thinking!! Excellent!!\n \n To quote georged, \n \n \nBye, bye, Prototype.\n",

It's a little difficult to have slaves on your plantation and not have anyone notice. \n \n One statement you made is a safe bet, but I hope you were trying to be humorous: \"now there are very few if any people who have slaves in their homes.\"\n\n \n I can understand where you wouldn't believe laws stop things altogether. I find myself agreeing that making abortion illegal may not make it completely nationwide itself. But making abortions illegal will reduce sex a little if not a lot. I believe that if pregnancy was an issue you once again were made to live with, men and women would not be so casual about it.\n \n There are two points where you're predicting results are faulty. 1. Children unwanted is nonsense. There are couples out there who can't wait to adopt a child or children. 2. And making it harder to commit a crime is not wrong. If abortion were declared a crime, then illegal abortions being made would make no difference. Men get injured and killed during robberies all the time, maybe we should make that legal.",

   "That is exactly my point, Poindexter. \n You need to support your reasoning why abortion is wrong, so you use rhetoric, like \"baby murder\". A fetus is different than a baby, hence it is not wrong to have an abortion. I would not call fetus a baby, even if abortion is not considered. They are different. One is inside another person's uterus attached to that person with an umbilical cord. The other is not.\n \n If you think that abortion is wrong and should be illegal, that's your opinion. I disagree but respect your right to hold an opinion. If you resort to wordplay to back up your opinion, I object to that obfuscation. That's my point.\n\n \n I understand now.

   "Personally, if you want my opinion... what am i talking about, of course you do. \n \n I think that in no circumstance should anyone get an abortion. Not even in the case of rape. The only time abortion should become an option should be if the mother's life is in danger. There is no reason why someone should kill another human being just because it's unwanted. In most cases, it's because people didn't take the responsibility and use protection or that didn't work.

   "Personally, if you want my opinion... what am i talking about, of course you do. \n \n I think that in no circumstance should anyone get an abortion. Not even in the case of rape. The only time abortion should become an option should be if the mother's life is in danger. There is no reason why someone should kill another human being just because it's unwanted.

I don't think so, just because the fetus is eaquiped with everything it desires already does not mean it still does not desire them.\n\n Evidence the Fetus or Neonate Can Feel Pain \n Anand's seminal work with neonates undergoing surgery demonstrated the major hormonal response to invasive practice could be significantly reduced with fentanyl added to the anesthetic regimen (Anand et al., 1987). Plasma adrenalin, noradrenaline, glucagon, aldosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and 11-deoxycortisol levels, however, were significantly elevated in the non-fentanyl group up to 24 hours after surgery. Reduced hormonal response was viewed as responsible for the improved clinical outcome of the fentanyl group, which required less post-surgical ventilatory support and had reduced circulatory and metabolic complications. Anand and Hickey (1992) advanced these findings in a subsequent report indicating that neonates receiving deep anesthesia during surgery had improved post-operative morbidity compared with neonates receiving lighter anesthesia. The reduced hormonal response and improved clinical outcome following invasive surgery-in conjunction with anesthetics used for pain relief in adults-led to the conclusion that neonates could feel pain and that this pain needed to be controlled (Rogers, 1992).\n \n Further support comes from the work of Fitzgerald (1987, 1994), who has reviewed the biological development of the fetus and examined the possibility of fetal pain at each stage of development. At 7.5 weeks' gestation, reflex responses to somatic stimuli begin, and touching the perioral region results in a contralateral bending of the head. The palms of the hands become sensitive to stroking at 10.5 weeks, and the rest of the body and hindlimbs become sensitive at approximately 13.5 weeks. Shortly after the development of sensitivity, repeated skin stimulation results in hyperexcitability and a generalized movement of all limbs. This hyperexcitability has been interpreted as evidence for the presence of a functional pain system, reflecting an immature but intact pain response with early hypersensitivity to stimulation (Barr, 1994). This view is not widely accepted, however, and is rejected by Fitzgerald herself. Prior to 26 weeks, the thalamocortical fibers have not yet penetrated the cortical plate, and it seems unlikely the cortical structures considered necessary for pain are responding to noxious stimulation (Mrzljak, Uylings, Kostovic, & van Eden, 1988). \n \n The evidence for cortical involvement post-26 weeks is enhanced by behavioral studies that have demonstrated focused and organized responses to noxious stimulation that can be better discriminated from other distress responses (Craig, Whitfield, Grunau, Linton, & Hadjistavropoulos, 1993). As with the hormonal response to surgery, the behavioral responses can be reduced with the use of appropriate anesthetic (Fitzgerald, Millard, & McIntosh, 1989).\n \n Having established the necessary neurobiology for pain is in place and that behavioral responses to noxious stimulation are present in premature babies of approximately 26 weeks gestation, it is logical to suggest a fetus of at least 26 weeks' gestation will respond similarly to invasive practice as observed in neonates undergoing surgery. Giannakoulopoulos et al. (1994) from the Queen Charlottes Hospital in London, England, successfully demonstrated intrauterine needling to obtain blood samples from fetuses at 20 to 34 weeks' gestation results in a hormonal stress response. They demonstrated that needling the innervated intraabdominal portion of the umbilical vein, rather than the placental cord (which is not innervated) resulted in increased cortisol and b-endorphin concentrations in fetal plasma. If this group or others can demonstrate the hormonal and neural \"stress response\" can be prevented with the use of appropriate anesthetics, they will have mirrored the criteria that have led to the widespread acceptance of \"neonatal pain.\"\n \n Evidence Against An Experience of Pain \n The undisputed discovery that the neonate and fetus launch a hormonal and neural response to invasive practice cannot be considered proof there is an experience of pain. An experience implies sensations have been interpreted in a conscious manner. Even when combined with the observations of behavior and improved clinical outcome when using anesthetics, there is still no proof there is an experience of pain. Although all of these phenomena are associated with the notion of \"pain,\" none of them adequately describe or explain the phenomenological experience of \"pain.\" These phenomena may exist independently of conscious experience. The relationship between the physiological responses of nociceptors, the hormonal and other responses of the CNS, and the behavioral outcome of these changes to the psychological response are yet to be determined (Wall & McMahon, 1986).\n \n If a proper assessment of neonatal and fetal pain is to be undertaken, we should examine the structure of the psychological experience of \"pain,\" as the biological structures have been examined, and then work backwards to the fetus and neonate to decide whether it is likely or possible these psychological structures are in place (Derbyshire, 1999). \n \n Pain experience is now widely seen as a consequence of an amalgam of cognition, sensation, and affective processes, commonly described under the rubric of the biopsychosocial model of pain. Pain is no longer regarded as merely a physical sensation of noxious stimulus and disease, but is seen as a conscious experience that may be modulated by mental, emotional, and sensory mechanisms with sensory and emotional components. The biopsychosocial concept emphasizes the multidimensional nature of illness, injury, and pain, rather than emphasizing pain as a purely physical fact of illness or injury. Pain has been described as a multidimensional phenomena for some time (Melzack & Casey, 1968), and this understanding is reflected in the current IASP definition of pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage\" (Merskey, 1991).\n \n If this 'multidimensionality' is the basis of conscious pain experience, it seems unlikely we can attribute this experience to the neonate or unborn fetus, which is naive to the cognitive, affective, and evaluative experiences necessary for pain awareness. This is accepted in the current definition of pain, which is further expanded to state, \"Pain is always subjective. Each individual learns the application of the word through experiences related to injury in early life.\" Pain does not, so to speak, spring forth from the depths of the person's mind prior to any experience, but is gradually formed as a consequence of general conscious development. \n \n Interestingly, even those authors who support a concept of fetal pain tend to back away when confronted with the need to explain pain phenomenology. Giannakoulopoulos et al (1994), for example, distanced themselves from any implied fetal pain experience with the statement, \"a hormonal response cannot be equated with the perception of pain.\" Lloyd-Thomas and Fitzgerald (1996) have suggested if feeling and pain are properly understood, the fetus cannot be said to feel pain. \n \n A further reason to doubt the viability of fetal pain post-26 weeks' gestation is the development of the fetal cortex. Although the thalamocortical fibers penetrate the cortical plate at approximately 26 weeks' gestation, the cortical regions that have been identified as important in processing the various components of pain (Derbyshire, 2000) do not become fully responsive until after birth (Chugani & \n \n \n \n And does a new born have a interest in it's future? No, its not the much different from a fetus in the way it acts. so why not just kill babies if they become to hard to handle and the mother feels that they made a bad choice having it\n\n Even a newborn has a basic interest in it's future.It looks towards feedings and bonding with mom.Not to mention a newborn is sentient and is a seperate individule proected by law.\n \n \nNo i didn't lol. I love how some of you twist and spin things. I feel that an unborn child is still a child, and is still a human being. I never once, not once said that this childs life is more improtant then the life of an actual existing person. I implied that it is just as important, its equal.\nEven so,when there is a conflict of interest (mother vs fetus) one of them is going to lose out.In this case I put the already born sentient person before the non-born non-sentient fetus.You can not be equal in this situation,one is going to be valued more than the other.Seeing that forced pregnancy for rape is your solution you but the value of the fetus before the mother PERIOD.",

   "Im sorry to hear you had to go through that, i truly am. But a childs life is no more meaningless then your own. A CHILDS LIFE SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED, a child has a body, health concerns, and should not be deemed any less significant then yours. A child's life is not null and void because of the horrible actions of their biological father. \n\n \n Any rape for me would be very quickly followed by the morning after pill. At that point the fetus doesn't have a brain, let alone concerns in said brain. And when are you gonna get that it isn't about punishment?\n \n \nOuch... i don't think you know what your talking about. I never once suggested that you consider raising the child with him.. heck if i had my way you wouldn't be able to because he'd be dead. I love women, and i have much sympathy for you and others that have gone through what you have. But i also love children, and by no means, in no circumstance should their lives be ended by another \n\n \n Unless they are already born - like my son? How about all the civilian children who die in war every day? Or the ones that starve every day? Are you protesting the war in Iraq? On the bandwagpon with Bono and the ONE campaign? Or is it only those not yet born that you are loving to the point of disrupting and possible destroying the lives of women you don't know and their families?\n \n \nNO.... you don't understand. won't someone please think about the children!!! I understand that what you've gone through is horrible, and I do not consider others who have gone through it and have gotten pregnant stupid at all!!! However, LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT!!! you should not kill another just because it has inconvenienced you. I'm sorry to all women that have been raped, and i hold women in very high regard and i respect them very much. BUT I VALUE LIFE, CONSIDERBLE, especially that of a child's. It happened, and im sorry, but do not, i repeat DO NOT sentence the child to death!!!\n\n \n I highly doubt you understand what I have been through - as a rape victim, in pregnancy or as a mother. \n \n Again with the trivialization - pregnancy is more than inconvenience. If I were pregnant again and could not work me and my son would get hungry fast and at the very least lose my house. But no worries - we all just live on air right? How dare I want the conveniences of home and food! \n \n Sorry Evan - I will not jeopardize my situation for some rapists seed just because YOU think its precious. Last I checked YOU ain't paying MY bills.",
