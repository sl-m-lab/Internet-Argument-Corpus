   "So how come our unbiased and fair media hasn't mentioned Obama's intent to set up some kind of civilian national security force as big as, and as well funded as the military? This is America, not Kenya, for crying out loud. This guy is probably going to be elected, and then we can look forward to being treated like poor Joe the Plumber if we open our mouths. People better think twice before voting for this would-be martinet:\n \n YouTube - Obama Civilian Security\n \n He says: \"We cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.\"\n \n No look at it this way: \n The Federales = \"national security force\"\n La Guardia Civil = \"national security force\"\n Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps = \"national security force\"\n \n Do we want an Obama version of that here in the US?\n \n Russia and Hitler's Germany had large internal \"security\" forces to keep the people in line and to stop criticism of the government. Obama has recently showed his tendeny to silence anybody who speaks out against him. Joe the Plumber gets investigated (his child support account was accessed - I used to work for Human Services, that's patently unethical). He kicks certain reporters off his plane - those who have newspapers which haven't bowed to him! He constantly bad-mouths Hannity (what will become of him?). We have a future under Obama when even this post might be pulled up by the new \"civilian national security force,\" and investigated. In fact, this whole forum might be subjected to review for \"hate crimes.\" \n \n I'm afraid of what is around the corner. People have been so hypnotized by him that at the present, he can do anything and nobody calls him on it. When people begin to notice problems, it may be too late.",

   "How \"unbiased and fair\" is it to truncate a speech that's calling for increased involvement and funding for Americorps, the Peace Corps, and other volunteer organizations and make it seem like it's a speech calling for some paramilitary force?\n \n Here's what he's actually talking about.
