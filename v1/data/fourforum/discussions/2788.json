They probably didn't work hard enough! It's a good idea to lock up drug addicts in prison, where they still have access to the same drugs, and are released again with little chance of getting a job, having been convicted of a felony, and still are addicted to the same drugs, having not been treated.

   "To me, the problem with the liberal mindset is that the solutions that liberal types tend to come up with rarely seem to solve the problem at hand, and often seem to make it worse. \n \n \nIt's only a select view Limbaughites that feel that you should die if you can't afford health care, and they deserve it for being poor! They probably didn't work hard enough!\n\n \n This part kind oif goes with this one:\n \n \nTo hell with 'em. Companies shouldn't have to provide a liveable wage for anyone, if you don't like the job, don't work there! \n \n \n Yes, I think companies should provide a livable wage for everybody. i don; thtink government health care is likely to be a real good idea, since the government pretty much screws up everything it touches. I have a really radical idea on this, we pay everybody enough that they can afford to buy their OWN health insurance. Even Mc Donalds offers insurance. The problem is, at the same time the liberals seem to want higher wages, they are tossing around stuff like this:\n \n \nBut to hell with those filthy Mexicans STEALING those same jobs! emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n If we keep allowing illegals , who are willing ot work for minimum wage, to provide cheap labor, what exactly is the incentive to raise wages? This is (allegedly) a free market economy. Wages are controlled by supply and demand, just like everything else. If mexicans are willing to come to this country and work for $5.25, that is where you set your curve. \n \n You can't have it both ways. Either you kill off the cheap labor (not literally, of course), or you live with low wages. \n \n \nIt's a good idea to lock up drug addicts in prison, where they still have access to the same drugs, and are released again with little chance of getting a job, having been convicted of a felony, and still are addicted to the same drugs, having not been treated. \n \n \n This one I will agree with you 100% on. Our criminal justice system is so broken I think the hardest part about fixing it would be figuring out where to start. I think a good place would be by repealing mandatory sentencing guidelines. Put sentencing power back in the hands of a judge where it belongs, so people can be sentenced on a case by case basis. Does a guy who stole $100 because his family was starving really deserve the same sentence as a guy who steals $100 to buy a new stereo? I think not. Under present sentencing guidelines, though, those two are treated much the same. We have forsaken fighting crime in the name of revenge for criminal acts. This has gotten us nowhere.\n \n \nI only have to go their for work, it's all those lazy poor black people who live in the cities. \n \n \n The black community is another of those places where liberals have done massive harm. I had a black guy in for an interview the other day. Well dressed, good papers. He was from the bad end of kansas city, and just graduated from college w/ a degree in business. Unfortunatly, I couldn;t understand a word he said. I spoke with my sister in law, who is a teacher in an inner city school, and she explained that Ebonics (apparently ther is a name for that unintelligeble form of english) is being taught in schools now, and they they are not allowed to require the kids to learn proper english, or even to correct them in their english. \n \n We have a large population of illegal alins here, and any mexican kid who doesn't speak english gets their own full time interpeter who goes to classes with them. We don't require them to learn english, since we want to ensure that they don't feel bad about their heritage.\n \n I hav e news for you folks, and it is not politically correct, but it is 100% accurate. if you want people to be able to function in the American business world, they need to speak english. I realise that this is supposed to be a melting pot, and that there are special circumstances where you can be effective in business without learning english, but in general, you need to speak english to operate in American business. \n \n That guy who was in fro the interview the other day was set up for failure by well meanign liberals. He is going to end up back in the inner city, because that is the only place anybody can understand him. I cannot hire a sales rep that I cannot understand, and I certainly cannot hire a sales rep that my customers cannot understand.\n \n Those mexican kids who never learn to speak english are going to end up spending hteir lives as wage slaves at the local meat packing plant, just like their parents who came here hoping for a better life for their kids. They are pretty much doomed ot the same life their parents are living because a bunch of well meaning liberals thought they were helping the kids.\n \n This is the kind of thing that turns me off of the whole liberal movement. I am not interested in setting kids up for failure. Thati s just not something I find entertaining. I prefer to teach kids skills that will enable them to be sucessful. Somtimes that requires that you pull your ehad out of the clouds, set aside your ideas in regards to social justice and descrimination, and think from a logical, realistic standpoint occasionally.\n \n Now, I am definatly not saying that the O'reilly crowd, or the Limbaugh crowd do not have some pretty twisted ideas of their own. Don't think that for a minute, but liberals are killers. Liberals, brought us the massive social programs that have helped endure that 75% of black children are raised fatherless. Liberals have helped destroy the job market and drive down wages in the process of defending people who are in this country illegally in the first place. \n \n I think that liberals in general need to sit and think REAL HARD about the adverse effects of the programs they wish to see instituted before they ramrod them through.",

   "IMO the whole system is so broken by professional politicians using public money spending popularity to secure and hold office for personal gain and power that its just a matter of time until our economic conditions force reform. That won't be a pleasant experience. \n \n Arguments that liberal legislation has forced our values to a point of 'Gimme' are easily countered by voter apathy and industry's give-away program when times were really fat due to our industrial dominance and labor was in high demand. It didn't take rocket science to pay-off those too lazy to work and reward those who did with far beyond reasonable income levels to keep the wild ride going. In a country where the vote is virtually evenly divided between the two major political parties, I can't see where one side, liberal or conservative, is more to blame than the other. We vote those bandits into office and then complain when they use our money to buy future voting blocks. We're to blame, without regard to political affiliation, as we allowed circumstances develop to their current, unworkable state.",

   "Since when are most fast food workers illegal immigrants? I live around the corner from a Burger King, a Wendy's, a McDonalds, and an Arby's and I don't think there's a single immigrant working in any of them! \n \n Fact is, the minimum wage is a tool in making sure companies don't exploit people. For God's sake, Wal-mart is the #1 company in the world and their employees don't make ****. Paying poorly has helped them make a mint, and if there were no minimum wage, you can bet that the workers would be making even less. Hell, they hired illegal immigrants to clean, just to save a few bucks! No, the solution isn't to just let the companies set the pay to whatever they want, because the supply of people willing to work for peanuts is far too large, they would probably be paid literally in peanuts. It would cause the republicans to complain far more because there would be NO jobs for an unskilled but hard working American. If you force the companies to pay the same thing to both legal, and illegal workers, then the problem takes care of itself. Illegal workers who find work aren't forced to remain ultra-poor, and Americans wont be complaining about \"stealing our jobs\" because they are competing for the same pay as the immigrants, and have nobody to blame for not having a job but themselves.",

Without controls, or a constnat influx of cheap foreign labor, the market will inevitably balance these factors. Where you get into trouble is when you have millions of undocumented aliens coming across the border, willing ot work for next to nothing, and shipping every penny they can back out of the country. We have a meat packing plant in my town staffed almost entirely by illegal aliens (everybody but the managers, of course). They pack 15 people into a 3 bedroom house and everybody work double shifts. Tey work at the meat packing plant for 2 or 3 years, then load up their cash and head back to mexico. Since they started hiring illegals, starting wage has gone from $14 per hour to $8.50 per hour (meat packing is hard, nasty work, they deserve to be paid well). \n \n \n \nI'm not so sure about your statements about teaching ebonics in the inner city either.

I got myself elected to the school board last year out of disgust after reviewing some of the expenditures of our current board. My first day on the job, I leaked hundreds of pages of documents to the press, then at the next shool board meeting we cut $21 million from upcoming construction projects. The palns called for marble accent bands in the masonary at the new high school ($83,000 dollars worth) light fixtures in the librarry that cost $400 each, 2 swimming pools ($320,000), when the public pool is literally right next door to the school (we cut a deal with the city to for sole use of the lap pool during school hours....total cost..$0).\n \n Any time you are dealing with governmental entities, you tend to see this attitude that it is all free, so why worry about it. this seems to be especially bad with school boards, since qualifications tend to run pretty slim on many of them. \n \n \nAnd now that the state is receiving less funds from the federal government (thanks Dubya!), the situation is worse.

   "Health insurance, and labor unions seem \"liberal\".\n \n The others aren't necessarily liberal. Nixon ran on environmental issues, for instance, he saw it as something that affected EVERYONE, not just this group or that group. Too bad we can't get that logic back into the current republican admin. However, the environment should never be protected if it means somone gives up money as a result (which is the republican view).\n \n Pro-choice, affirmitive action, and protection from discrimination are more like human rights issues. I hope being liberal or conservative has nothing to do with securing basic human rights, although yes, many republicans get mixed up and think human rights somehow aren't a good thing. (They aren't at the expense of keeping their money).\n \n Gun control and fewer crimes in prison also have nothing to do with \"liberal\" or conservative. \n \n Gun control has to do with the NRA and picking up voters that believe having guns = fewer crimes, and in case the government gets outta control they will start shooting things up. And crimes in prison is a minor issues (relatively speaking), and anyone that thinks more deaths = good thing needs to have their head examined...unless it's in direct protection of our societies liberties.\n =====================\n I'm not impressed by Moore, he's either the anti-Rush (which is acceptable since Rush is doing it for popularity/money), or he's misguided.\n \n I'll sum up the actual core republican view:\n Cut taxes\n Small government\n \n Nothing else really matters to somone voting on these two issues. It really doesn't matter what else the party stands for or doesn't stand for. I mean, put the biggest idiot the public has ever seen in public office as the leader of the republican party, and they don't care. Why? As long as taxes get cut and government stays small, why SHOULD anyone care? They add together too. When the government is smaller, who retains power? Yes, *ding* you guessed it, the wealthy. What do the wealthy do with their power? Whatever they want. Usually make more money, trample on human rights and the environment. Of course they don't see a need to protect those things, they have power.\n \n You see, I think Moore asked a poor polling question. He should have had either \"none of the above\", or \"other\" as an option to that. Sure most Americans want those things, but put \"Tax cuts and small business\" up against that list and hold onto your pants.\n \n -mach",

   "Um... it may have been a better idea to post without saying it's michael moore, and then give the facts, and then at the end drop the bomb on them. When some of these XXXXXX see the name, they go ahead spouting \"liar! fatty!\" or whatever other **** they want to do to avoid the actual issue being discussed, in order to attack the guy. \n\n \n \n What facts? I do not see any so called \"facts\" in that initial (trolling IMO) post. \n \n BTW which \"XXXXXX\" are you refering to?\n \n \n \nI do believe that most Americans value most liberal ideals. I don't think you can get anyone to admit that a sick child shouldn't get health care. I don't think you can get anyone to admit that pollution is a good thing. I'm not even so sure that people are happy filling up prisons with harmless people, and then having to pay their hard earned money to do it. \n \n\n \n \n 1. No one is turned down from the emergency room.\n \n 2. Pollution is a bad thing... Using the issue to foward socialist anti-American ideology is much worse.\n \n 3. Where are the libs chanting release the non-violent felons.... no they want to put you away for owning a black rifle or praying in school...\n \n \n \nIt's only a select view Limbaughites that feel that you should die if you can't afford health care, and they deserve it for being poor! They probably didn't work hard enough! It's a good idea to lock up drug addicts in prison, where they still have access to the same drugs, and are released again with little chance of getting a job, having been convicted of a felony, and still are addicted to the same drugs, having not been treated. Auto companies shouldn't have to reduce the emissions on their vehicles. What kind of tree hugging hippie ******** is that? So what if it's unsafe to breathe the air in major cities? I only have to go their for work, it's all those lazy poor black people who live in the cities. To hell with 'em. Companies shouldn't have to provide a liveable wage for anyone, if you don't like the job, don't work there! But to hell with those filthy Mexicans STEALING those same jobs! emoticon_rolleyes \n\n \n Hmm please quote Limbaugh as to where he indicates that if you can not afford healthcare you should die......\n \n As for the rest of your rant.... emoticon_rolleyes",

   "You, for one. \n\n \n \n \n Just wanted to clear that up. Though I would point out that you really show your intelligence by your blatant name calling..... I do wonder though if you would be this obnoxious in person, somehow I doubt it.\n \n \n I am curious though.... Please articulate why I am an \"idiot\" according to you, this should be interesting... \n \n \n \n \n \n \n44% of the country has no health care. The only time your child needs medical attention is during an emergency? Get real. \n\n \n And anyone making less than a certain amount can get subsidized insurance for $150 a month. And do you ever quote your sources for your statistics or do you just make it up as you go along.\n \n \n \nWell, you're certainly entitled to your opinion. In MY opinion, the environment is the #1 issue I look at. It's important to EVERYONE. Who are you to decide what is anti-American anyway? Having the ten commandments on the steps of a courthouse is anti-American. Increasing federal control is anti-American. It's a shame that the Republican party has moved away from reducing federal control. It used to be one of their main points. \n\n \n \n I am not a Republican and you are not telling me anything new here... And apparently I am not entitled to my opinion as I get called an idiot by some \"warboss\" \n \n \n \nBy libs do you mean Democrats? Hate to burst your bubble, but most Democrats aren't even liberal. Real liberals have been against the war on drugs for years. And I don't know about other \"libs\" but I am in full support of the whole constitution, and all of it's amendments, including the second one. As far as praying in school, I think the constitution is quite clear that government institutions cannot endorse a religion. A public school leading prayers is a violation of people's rights. Amazing how you get your panties in a bunch over people violating your 2nd amendment rights, but you're fully willing to stomp all over someone else's 1st amendment rights. Hypocrite. You're not pro-American, you're a pro-religious-right-wing whack-job. \n \n\n \n \n \n Ahhh more name calling. You sound so intelligent, again I highly doubt your this obnoxious is person.... I never said \"public school leading prayer\" What I am for is the FREEDOM to choose to pray if you wish. To have a moment silence in the beginning of class infringes on no ones right. Pray, meditate, shoot spitballs it should be allowed... Some schools set aside special prayer rooms for muslims which is a violtion as that favors a religion, a moment of silence does not..\n \n Also the title of this thread is \"Is America a Liberal Paradise?\" So I am addressing liberals who most Dimocrats support. These are the same libs that believe the constitution is a living document and have no problem trampling on our freedoms.\n \n \n As for the panties they are not mine they belong to your GF/wife/Sister (whoever she was)she left them here last night, She can pick them up anytime.... \n \n \n \nAlso, I didn't say that Limbaugh said any of these things (although he probably has, I've heard him say things that are equally as dumb), but that many Limbaughites believe that ****.\n\n \n \n \n translation= You have nothing, and have again been caught making stuff up again...",
