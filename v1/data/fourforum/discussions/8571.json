Why not go to Tel Aviv where at least the gay community has a known accepted presence\n \n\n \n I don't feel any single person can speak for the gay community and I have no idea why the coordinators of the international march chose Jerusalem. \n At this point in time, it sounds like the march has been canceled or postponed, because of the current violence in northern Israel/southern Lebanon.\n \n Inciting a violent reaction is not valid. Many years ago in the US, despite protests that freedom of expression was being denied, neonazis were prevented from marching in Skokie, IL, a predominantly Jewish community, because of fears of violence. I say this only an an example of where freedom of expression can lead to problems. I think there is a distinct difference, however, in a gay pride march in a \"religious\" city. Gays and lesbians are religious, too. They do not espouse directly anti-religious sentiments by their mere existence. It is only a parade, for goodness sake. You don't have to watch it. It the mere presence of gays and lesbians an anti-religious statement? Is showing up \"getting in your face?\" If gays and lesbians are \"hated\" as you say in Jerusalem, they should just stay away? Perhaps the events surrounding the parade could lead to some mutual understanding. Do the people Jerusalem who hate XXXXXX have any culpability here?\n \n \n \n Then again, why do you need a parade at all? You don't see the heterosexuals having parades in San Fransisco. Why don't they? Because there is no need to justify being heterosexual. There is no need to plead to the world to be accepted. To give the message that you should be accepted by the world, is giving off the wrong message, especially by choosing a place like Jerusalem. By deciding that you need to tell the world that you should be accepted, innately shows that you in yourselves know that what you are doing is wrong. That you feel guilty of being like that, and therefor you need to be justified to the world. \n\n \n Heterosexuals have parades in San Francisco. You are right, they have no need to be justified, so they don't have straight pride marches, it is already a given. You have this all backwards. \"By deciding that you need to tell the world that you should be accepted\", merely means that we feel we are not accepted, there is no guilt involved.\n \n Expressing gay pride means I will not be ashamed of who I am and it is perfectly acceptable to say that out loud, even parade it. If I ever feel ashamed of myself it is because others behave like you and tell me I am a sinner. \n \n \n \n Besides for the fact that the world no longer has any objective standards as to what is right and what is wrong, and that if you work hard enough, you can get congress to vote affirmatively on anything. I am sure that if the ax murderers of today got enough pull in congress to allow mass murder then that too would be considered a legal fine way to behave.\n \n\n \n I feel there are standards for right and wrong; I am sorry you do not. What has this to do with a parade? Are you implying that being gay is comparable to ax murder? Are you implying that the gay community has any significant pull in Congress?\n \n \n \n Only in recent times has it been that psychologists have decided that gay is just another sexual outlet and that it isn't a disease. Other than the Roman era, there has never been a time where homosexuality has been an accepted practice. Even in Roman times it wasn't paraded around, it was done quietly. \n\n \n huh??

Punctuation and grammar are for grownups.\n\n first of all, i am not here to dazzle you with my grammatical skills. i am not writing as an author, i am writing about the reality of this world. i write solely for the content. \n \n you guys are all missing the point. you assume that what is reality for me is not reality for you. it is not about religious sects. i will give you an analogy. if you saw someone about to jump off of a bridge, and this is a person who has a short term memory and one of the things he forgets about is the existence of gravity (sounds ridiculous but listen to the point), and he is about to jump. do you tell him to stop? or do you say \"well he doesn't believe in gravity so...whatever let him go.\" do you think that since he doesn't believe in reality, that it will affect him less in any way? the answer is no. reality affects people regardless. whether you like it or not. whether you know about it or not. whether you care about it or not. reality is reality is reality. when i say that homosexuality is wrong i speak totally out of knowing what reality is. \n \n every single one of you now believes that there is no objective truth in the world. everyone can have their own opinions about anything and as long as it doesn't break the social contract of impinging on my personal set of beliefs, then you can do whatever you want. if you agree that there is no truth in the world, then you would let the guy jump. and i don't think anyone here with a slight bit on conscience would do that. why?? because you would feel it wrong to let him do so. but how can that be wrong? the only thing that is wrong is impinging on someone else's rights. \n \n what makes us human? I'll tell you what makes us human, our ability to have free choice. animals have no free choice, they can only do what is beneficial to their survival. they cant go out and dope up and O.D. they have no capability of that. humans are the only creatures of choosing to do something harmful to themselves. it also gives us the ability to have inhibitions. you can choose to overcome a challenge by controlling yourself. if everyone went and acted on every emotion they had, then we would have rape and murder in the streets. \n \n as far as getting married? i would still recommend that you get married. you can come to love anybody. even the biggest jackass on earth. how do i know? because there is a person who you will love unconditionally no matter how he/she is. who is that? your child(ren). no matter how evil they are and no matter how bad they get, you will love them. why? because love is not something you get hit with by cupid, that is infatuation. love is something you build. the more time and energy you put into a relationship, the more you will love that person. obviously you need to be attracted to your wife. no question about it. but are you telling me that a gay person has absolutely no feelings for any woman on earth? if that is true, then i am speechless. \n \n my \"callousness and rancor\" comes only out of one thing. and that is how people are willing to say about themselves that they have no control over themselves. this is not true, you can will the mind to do anything. the mind and body are way more powerful tools than you can imagine. you just have to make the commitment to want to work at it. it kills me to watch fellow humans degenerate themselves into animals. animals who have no control over themselves and dont choose to use their free choice to overcome an obstacle. all i ask is to work on yourselves.",

That is what this is all about. That is what homosexuality is. Same sex attraction. If it were something you could change most of us probably would have if we could have. Nobody likes to be an outcast or looked upon as a deviant. But since it is something that I cannot change, I have learned to deal with it. I have learned that there is nothing wrong with it. It would be nice if you could learn the same, but you are slave to your belief. I suppose you could say I am a slave to mine as well, but I do not pass judgement on the lives of others based on my beliefs. I am glad you are straight and a believer in God, have a wonderful life.

Are you aware that your belief has fooled you into thinking you know more about life then the next guy? It has fooled you into thinking you can be blunt, ignorant, rude, and tactless by speaking the words of your God. It has fooled you into thinking that you are actually of a higher moral standard then those you speak against. With all that you think you know, you don't know how to treat people who are different then you. And you don't know or you don't realize that your beliefs don't hold any water in other peoples lives.",

The situation exists because there is no other sexual outlet. \n \n \n you have learned there is nothing wrong with it from psychologists who of themselves don't believe in any objective rights and wrongs. they will tell you it is ok, because they have to according to the social contract. they know nothing of reality, all they know is human desire. \n \n \n \n I have learned there is nothing wrong with it because it does not make a person good or bad. My mother and father raised my sister and I to be kind, considerate, and responsible human beings. We both turned out to be that way. My sister had a family and the responsiblity that went along with it. I do not have a family, which has given me the opportunity to look after my grandparents, aunts and uncles, whose children no longer have the time or the desire to help those who raised them. In many instances it the gay grandson or nephew, or son, who is there to stand by and support the elders of his or her family. There is more to gay people then \"human desire\" as you put it. How dare you attempt to reduce the importance of another human being with your supposed conception of reality. \n \n \n again you are missing the point of objective reality, it is not about belief. it is simply about reality. it is not about me writing because i can change you, i want you to find reality and start living it.\n \n \n \n \n Your reality in my opiniopn is sheer dillusion. It is based on something you read in ancient book. That is not reality, it is what you perceive as reality based on your belief.\n \n \n \n once again, it is not about beliefs. it is about truth. there is an objective reality to this world. please find it.\n \n \n \n I have, thank you. It is based on my life experience and the lives of those around me. I continue to learn as I go along. I have discovered that a person's sexuality has no bearing on the type of person that they are. You appear be a busy body. Your intentions I sure are good, but there are things in this world that do not require your input, like other peoples lives.\n \n \n correction.. i know my view of the world is as objective and verifiable as gravity.\n \n \n \n I'm all ears, tell me all about it.\n \n \n i don't have hate issues with you, all i ask is that you wake up to reality.\n \n \n \n\n \n \n I know you don't hate me, and I do not hate you.
