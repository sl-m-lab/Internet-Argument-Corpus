Bolton, President Bush's sharp-elbowed nominee to become U.N. ambassador, survived a cliffhanger Senate committee vote Thursday after renewed criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, leaving the final confirmation decision to the full Senate....\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20050513/ap_on_go_co/un_ambassador\n \n Voinovich is only speaking out because he can afford it. The rest of the republicans don't have as stable ground to vote aganist or give such harsh words with elections comming soon. \n \n Either way, I agree with Voinovich's statements, particuarly the private sector comment. \n \n Bolton is horrible for the job, and perhaps the right will realize that when we are paying for everything in our next adventure.",

   "Of course the part about the hypocritical UN detractors obviously went over your head. But I expected that. \n \n It is amusing you would rather ignore how your argument fails and then declare you are right (or use some other cop out) then address the problems of your reasoning. At least you respond in some decent fashion, unlike VOR and his idiocy.\n\n \n Let me explain something here. I don't spend my entire life on this board although it occasionally seems that way. I tend to skip over posts especially if they are long and rambling and try to address the most salient points. There is nothing wrong with just asking simple, direct questions. I'm unlikely to miss the question posed. I also have a developing vision problem and will have to have cateract surgery within the month. This is not to offer up an excuse but sometimes I just don't see what is printed there. \n \n I did reread Eddie's post and he made a number of assertions. I could jump up and down and try to respond with my own take but I didn't necessarily see the point of it. For example what am I supposed to say to these questions?\n \n What life? What has UN, as an organisation done that would not have happened without it?\n \n And you do realise that america was one of those members who actively inititiated, authorized, enforced and defended the oil-for-food programme? \n \n I could only speculate about the first question. The second carries with it assertions that I am not about to study about since it would take an inordinate amount of time and really is just a blanket assertion that we are somehow responsible for the oil for food mess. How would I possibly know when American officials knew something was amiss; when they started to express concerns, etc.?\n \n If I may offer up a suggestion to anyone who wants a direct response to a question, frame the question with some sense of what the facts are before asking the question. The way to know how this is done is to listen to a presidential news conference or any of the Sunday political programs. For example:  It can be factually stated that U.S. in consort with its allies in 1995 (I'm guessing) instituted the \"oil for food\" program in Iraq. Now the U.S. is claiming that the U.N. is corrupt and should be held accountable. Why didn't the U.S. go to the U.N. and bring this concern to their attention before the decision was made to go to war with Iraq. \n \n That way I have a framework from which to reply. As it is now it simply a bare assertion that may or may not have any basis in reality any more than the question \"when did you stop beating your wife?\"",
