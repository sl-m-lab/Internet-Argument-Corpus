   "03rd July 2009\n \n   The most violent country in Europe: Britain is also worse than South Africa and U.S. \n In the decade following the party's election in 1997, the number of recorded violent attacks soared by 77 per cent to 1.158million - or more than two every minute. \n \n The figures, compiled from reports released by the European Commission and United Nations, also show: \n \n \u00b7 The UK has the second highest overall crime rate in the EU.\n \u00b7 It has a higher homicide rate than most of our western European neighbours, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n \u00b7 The UK has the fifth highest robbery rate in the EU.\n \u00b7 It has the fourth highest burglary rate and the highest absolute number of burglaries in the EU, with double the number of offences than recorded in Germany and France. \n \n But it is the naming of Britain as the most violent country in the EU that is most shocking. The analysis is based on the number of crimes per 100,000 residents. \n \n In the UK, there are 2,034 offences per 100,000 people, way ahead of second-placed Austria with a rate of 1,677. \n \n The U.S. has a violence rate of 466 crimes per 100,000 residents, Canada 935, Australia 92 and South Africa 1,609. \n \n Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'This is a damning indictment of this government's comprehensive failure over more than a decade to tackle the deep rooted social problems in our society, and the knock on effect on crime and anti-social behaviour. \n\n \n However, their figures for Australia are incorrect according to the latest figures from the Australian FBI.\n \n   Violent crime statistics \n * Recorded assault increased again in 2007, to 840 per 100,000, compared with 623 per 100,000 in 1996. The 2007 rate was the highest recorded since 1996.\n * The rate for robbery peaked in 2001. Rates have declined by 38 percent since 2001, to 86 per 100,000 per year.\n \n * The rate of kidnapping remained between three and four per 100,000 per year from 1996 to 2007.\n \n * The homicide rate was 1.9 per 100,000 in 1996 (which includes the 35 victims of the Port Arthur massacre) and was at its highest in 1999, at 2.0 per 100,000. In 2007, the rate was 1.3 per 100,000, the lowest recorded (since 1996).\n \n * The rate of recorded sexual assault increased between 1997 and 2007, from 78 to 94 persons per 100,000 per year.\n\n Yes it is a fact that we have 3 or 4 more murders per 100,000 than either Australia or England! The Murderous drug trade!",

The trick is not presenting a linear and easily acquired target; you make erratic movements so you can't get caught.\n \n And another thing, the national average for police shots hitting their targets is only 38%, meaning you've got a 62% chance of being a victim of a random shot by police. What exactly do you think is the percentage rate of successful shots by criminals, especially when their intended victim is running away from them?\n \n For that matter, how many petty street thugs are going to discharge an excessively loud weapon when their intended victim has started running?\n \n \nAn unarmed criminal would be unable to do that.

I know that you do not REALLY want an actual sociology reason, but I think it is important. Maybe we can get something done.\n \n Our Inner City youth in the U.S. tend to believe that you cannot allow anyone to insult you, or you are a punk. Somehow our Inner City Drug Gangs and thugs have been instilled with the impression that it is OK to kill another person oven minor squabbles. This is something we have got to change, but I don't see anyone doing that. The Democrats have Full Control of all of our government but it is the same old thing, but with a whole bunch more deficit spending. The same Patriot Act and all, so I don't think that they will make any changes for the better. We have kicked God out of our schools, so it looks like it is the job of our mothers and fathers, but no one is talking about this at all. \n \n   CRIME: THE INNER-CITY CRISIS \n The problem of youth homicide is very heavily concentrated in black males aged 15-19.3\n For inner-city black teenagers, the homicide rate is astronomical. The huge rise in gun crime perpetrated by older urban teenagers has not been replicated in other areas. In the suburbs, where legal restrictions on guns are generally less severe, the mortality rate has stayed about the same.\n \n Gun control advocates sometimes convey the impression that current murder rates are dramatically higher than ever before. And if one looks at statistics for particular age groups, one finds a substantial rise in murder arrests. From 1985 to 1991, arrests of adults for murder declined, but arrests for murder of 17-year-old males rose 121%; arrests of 16-year-old males rose 158%; arrests of 15-year-old males rose 217%; and arrests of boys 12 and under rose 100%.\n \n The white youth homicide arrest rate has remained stable, while the black rate has skyrocketed. Some drug policy scholars trace the sudden upsurge in violence to the pharmacological effects of crack/cocaine. Economist Sam Staley argues that the war on drugs and the criminalization of the drug trade generate levels of violence that make the inner city unlivable, with levels of violence far higher than would occur in a world where drugs were controlled by means other than the criminal law.20 Since drug dealers are likely to be carrying large sums of money, they are at serious risk of robbery. Since they cannot rely on the police for protection, they must, to survive, protect themselves.\n\n \n   Violence in America - Effective Solutions \n more than two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are involved with drug trafficking or have evidence of ante-mortem illicit drug use.\n \n Not only do the data show that acquaintance and domestic homicide are a minority of homicides,[26] but the FBI's definition of acquaintance and domestic homicide requires only that the murderer knew or was related to the decedent. That dueling drug dealers are acquainted does not make them \"friends.\" Over three-quarters of murderers have long histories of violence against not only their enemies and other \"acquaintances,\" but also against their relatives.\n \n The gun control advocacy literature from the \"medical community\" shows that fully two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are, in fact, drug dealers and their customers who wreak tremendous human and economic havoc upon society.
