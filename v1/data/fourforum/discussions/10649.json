   "I contend that: Atheists have no framework for morality.\n\n We can actually address the resolution as you've worded it here, but I'd rather clear up some of these other things first.\n \n \nMorality only comes from Christianity.\n\n If this is true, then there was no morality before Christianity. Yet, the ten commandments predate Christianity. Oops.\n Oh, but you're going to say that they're in the Bible, and they're from the Christian God, right? Well, I'm not at all sorry to remind you, the Code of Hammurabi predates any of the commandments. Oops.\n \n \nAtheists believe that each and every person should have their own reality.\n\n Find me three atheists who think this. \n \n \nIf one removes God from the picture of moral discussion, one removes the possibility that there are any such things as moral truths; the possibility that there are, in fact, right answers to moral questions.\n\n This is a philosophical question, not a religious one. In either case, though, you won't find absolute morals in the Bible.\n \n \n \n... Because there is no ultimate moral truth, there is no possible way to question the assertion. The only possible response, if you disagree with the atheist, is to say you prefer behavior Y. \n But in so doing, you establish personal preferences as the criteria for ethical behavior, which justifies the atheist in his assertion.\n\n So because you don't understand our arguments about ethics, you pretend they don't exist. Good to know.\n \n \nHere is but a glimpse at the \"morality\" wrought by Atheism:\n\n That's not a list that has anything to do with atheism. If you want to talk numbers of murders caused by Christian sources, how about you add up all the deaths caused or facilitated by God Himself according to the Bible, then add all the deaths from the Crusades and the Inquisition, just for starters. Problem is, those numbers are so astronomical that you won't find accurate counts. The church could have tried keeping up with how many people they tortured and killed, but they were too busy torturing and killing. What a shame.",

They may not claim divine source or similar for it, but informal rules of \"this is done, and this is NOT done\" emerge. Always.\n \n \n Second, it completely forgets that there are many many religions and philosopies that have attained a quasi-religious status all over the world. To claim Christian exclusivity is, I'm sorry to say it, either ridiculously uninformed or downright insulting to all the other religions and beliefs. Try Buddhist teachings, Confucianism, the Giri concept of the Japanese and similar for examples of high morality standards that have no connection whatsoever to Christianity.\n \n \n Third, it is most tiresome to see all the horrors of the world ascribed to atheism when atheism has nothing to do with them. Atheism has nothing to do with the nationalism of the Nazis and Fascists, has nothing to do with the cult of personality established by various dictators and similar. And don't even try to claim I don't know any of it. I LIVE in the area you claim as \"Tito's slaughterhouse\". I KNOW what it was all about. And atheism didn't get even nearly close to the true causes.\n \n \n Fourth: Atheism merely excludes god as a source of morality. That's all, as far as morality is concerned. Moralities can still be established on other bases, including philosophical discourse, statistical analysis and sociological studies. The basic \"thou shalt not kill\" forms even within animal families, as sibling animals learn to cooperate against the outer world.

   "I contend that: Atheists have no framework for morality.\n \n Morality only comes from Christianity. \n\n \n If we were to take this claim seriously, we would have to conclude that no atheists throughout history have ever behaved morally, or postulated moral codes that operate in the absence of belief in a deity, and that there is no morality in countries that aren't ruled by Christianity today (the great majority), or existed anywhere on the planet before Christianity.\n \n Since both conclusions are manifestly at odds with reality, we can say the thesis has been flatly disproved.

It merely means a secular moralist must justify moral codes on the basis of their intrinsic rationality and real world consequences, rather than appealing to a deity as an arbitrary authority.

The only possible response, if you disagree with the atheist, is to say you prefer behavior Y.\n \n \n This accusation ignores the many philosophical treatises written by secular philosophers to base morality on truths other than commandments attributed to some deity or other.

I, however, did not resort to personal attacks against another poster - Electrolyte did.\n\n You are welcome to your observation, but when you call atheists amoral, that is an attack. I didn't rely on strange arguments, I didn't rely on obscure philosophy, and I didn't rely on anti-religious bias. I relied solely on history that you cannot refute. And you didn't even try.\n \n Furthermore, you pull out the special pleading and argue that God is allowed to do despicable things because he's God. First, this is atrocious.

After you've done so (including addressing the Crusades and the Inquisition), you should answer the following questions.\n \n 1. Atheists don't rely on \"godly\" arguments to come up with moral standards, yet most of them come up with identical or nearly identical sets. If morals are impossible without the Christian God's help, how can this be?\n \n 2. Christians don't follow the Bible's morality anyway. The Bible says that it's fine to own and beat slaves, that it's fine to sell your daughter into slavery, that it's fine-- nay, required to murder a person for blasphemy and for cursing a parent, etc. Instead, Christians pick and choose their morals from the Bible, accepting some and rejecting most. If God's word is the basis for their morality, (a) why do Christians have to pick and choose, and (b) why do Christians tend to select identical or nearly identical sets? (c) Why does \"Christian morality\" change with the times? For example, 18th century Christians saw no problem with slavery. I'm betting you do, although one never really knows...\n \n 3. Atheists have morals based on their reasoning and experience. Atheists understand that murder is wrong without being told from an outside source. Christians have to be told that murder is wrong in order to believe that murder is wrong. Which of these groups seems more morally advanced?\n \n And my personal favorite: \n 4. From where does God get His morals?\n A. If God makes up His morals, then you're stuck acknowledging that if God says it's okay to torture your slaves, to rape virgins kept from your pillaging, and to murder blasphemers, then it must be true. But this problem is not limited to just examples we find in the Bible (although its tellingly hard to find examples of terrible morals that aren't endorsed by God somewhere in the Bible). If God said that it was immoral to not rape little girls, then that would mean that it really is immoral not to rape little girls. Does that mean that you'd rape little girls and feel no guilt?\n B. If God doesn't just make up His morals, then He gets them from somewhere else. If this is the case, then God isn't the ultimate authority on morals, is He? It would mean that God is not the source of morality, and morality exists without God at all.\n \n If God told you to murder me, would you do it? Would it be moral?\n \n I await your addressing of these points. But I'm not holding my breath.",

I see the killing of all those by God(or God's chosen people) as an evil act. It amazes me that acts we in 21st Century find immoral will be rendered as moral as soon as the believer effectively says its God's will.\n \n \nAnd yet the atheist belief system allows for everyone to have their own seperate set of morals.

   "It's certainly possible for atheists to come up with secular moral philosophies that do not depend on theistic beliefs:\n \n Humanist Manifesto 2000\n A Call for a New Planetary Humanism\n \n \n1. Preamble\n \n Humanism is an ethical, scientific, and philosophical outlook that has changed the world. Its heritage traces back to the philosophers and poets of ancient Greece and Rome, Confucian China, and the Charvaka movement in classical India. Humanist artists, writers, scientists, and thinkers have been shaping the modern era for over half a millennium. Indeed, humanism and modernism have often seemed synonymous for humanist ideas and values express a renewed confidence in the power of human beings to solve their own problems and conquer uncharted frontiers.\n \n II. Prospects for a Better Future\n \n For the first time in human history we possess the means provided by science and technology to ameliorate the human condition, advance happiness and freedom, and enhance human life for all people on this planet.\n \n III. Scientific Naturalism\n \n The unique message of humanism on the current world scene is its commitment to scientific naturalism. Most world views accepted today are spiritual, mystical, or theological in character. They have their origins in ancient pre-urban, nomadic, and agricultural societies of the past, not in the modern industrial or postindustrial global information culture that is emerging. Scientific naturalism enables human beings to construct a coherent world view disentangled from metaphysics or theology and based on the sciences...\n\n \n It is utterly incomprehensible that Christians should claim they are the only moral people on the planet. That sort of hubris doesn't seem to me to something that can emerge from an acceptance of Christ's teachings, as it is in direct conflict with them, especially those about humility and brotherly love. \n \n The question should be: Can Christianism (the belief that Christianity is not only vastly morally superior to all other religious and philosophical systems, but that it is morally unacceptable for anyone to be a non-Christian) generate valid moral values? The evidence to date, based on the behaviour of Christianists towards non-Christians, suggests it cannot.\n \n BTW, I am not Big_Bear_Scot ... he's on the OTHER side of Scotland! ;)",

YOU would be unable to co-exist, as you more or less try to say, with the others around you cause you will have lost your God.\n \n I am sorry you consider human beings 'too small'. I suggest you take a look around you and see what 'immoral' people have achieved. You will be amazed by the REAL wonders they have made!\n \n And then, please explain to me how can one who is non-stop staring at you, waiting for you to make the slightest mistake by not OBEYING HIS orders just to see you burning in HIS own hell fires be moral?\n \n What exactly is morality for you?",
