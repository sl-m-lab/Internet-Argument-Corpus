Thank you for your openness and honesty in exposing the true agenda of radical islam. Maybe now, some of the liberal bleeding hearts around here will understand the threat islam poses when they hear the threats directly from one of you. \n \n Oh, and I totally believe you are sincere in your hatred and threats toward anyone who dares to disagree with the cult that teaches you to hate anyone who believes differently than you do. I will pray that the Lord of Grace breaks down that wall of hatred and fills your heart with the love and forgiveness that Jesus Christ came and died to give to us.",

Jesus must be so proud of you. emoticon_ic emoticon_frazzled\n \n Prophet of Doom - Islamic Terrorism Timeline - Introduction - Islamic Terrorism Timeline From 1960-2004\n\n \n Here, below is only an excerpt from the first section of the link called Islam's 1000-year Crusade. Now tell me, how is this history of terror which is based in the very foundation of islam is our fault or was originally caused by us in any way? What you all prove is that you have a very short term view of a very old problem. How dare you blame us for finally attempting to defend ourselves against what this evil cult has always represented.\n Islam's 1,000-Year Crusade\n Islamic Terrorism Timeline\n \n 11/16/2006\n \n The tendency when dealing with Islamic terrorism is to focus on the last attack and then to blame it on an individual or group. I tried to solve this problem with Prophet of Doom - Islam's Terrorist Dogma in Muhammad's Own Words. As the best-documented, most comprehensive, chronological and contextual presentation of Islam's oldest sources, it proved convincingly that today's terrorist have not corrupted their religion, but instead it has corrupted them.\n Yet all of the proof in the world doesn't matter if you can't get people to examine it, and at 1,000 pages, Prophet of Doom requires a considerable commitment of time. And even when you understand what it reveals about Muhammad and his religion, there is still a gap of considerable time from his life to his legacy. Not wanting to skip over the one-thousand years between the invention of Islam and the start of the Islamic Terrorism Timeline, I have prepared this overview. While it is not yet comprehensive, it is sufficient for you to know that today's terrorists did not simply fall out of the sky. Not only is Islam responsible for what they do, it has been responsible for inspiring bad behavior for a very long time.\n To a large degree, the answer to the vexing question of why Muslims kill, is hidden within this history. Muslims will tell you that they are fighting a defensive battle against aggression. They say that their violence is a legacy of the Crusades, and therefore in their minds, it is the result of unprovoked Christian hostility toward them. Most Islamic terrorists justify their attacks on the West by saying \"the Crusaders are once again stealing Muslim lands.\" But is there any evidence that Christians, Crusaders or otherwise, ever stole land which legitimately belonged to Muslims? In other words, are the Islamic justifications for terror valid?\n After fighting a series of successful defensive battles against the advancing Islamic jihadists outside Rome in 1090, the Roman Catholics and Western European potentates agreed to help the Byzantines defend themselves against Islam. As a result, they launched the first crusade in 1095.\n This \"Christian\" response, while it is not labeled as such, is the only portion of this rather important drama academia seems to care about. And I suppose that is because it allows the \"enlightened\" to bash Christianity. Yet to focus on the Crusades while ignoring the intervening thirteen centuries of Islamic aggression, occupation, and plunder is like watching a documentary on the KKK in 1920 and then thinking you understand America.\n Most Westerners do not know that a century before the Crusades were initiated, Rome, the religious capital of Europe, had been besieged by Islam. They do not equate the four-hundred-fifty-year siege of Constantinople, the political capital of Christendom, with the Catholic response. Nor are most aware that Christians had been ruthlessly persecuted in the Holy Land and their churches had been burned by the Muslims who occupied the region. Further, the Crusaders were about the business of returning Jerusalem to the Byzantines who had the Holy Land stolen from them by Muslim mujahideen.\n The city itself wasn't large or important strategically, militarily, or economically. But it was symbolic because Christian pilgrims traveled there and Jews lived there. And even though Jerusalem was 1500 miles from Rome, when we understand the conflict born out of Islam's desire to control it and the rest of the world, we'll better appreciate why these terrorists were continuing to lash out in frustration.\n Yahweh's capital had essentially been ignored for centuries after the 135 CE diaspora of the Jews following the uprising led by Rabbi Akiba and his false Messiah Bar Kochba. In that pagan Rome destroyed most everything in Judea and salted the earth, not much happened in the Holy Land until the seventh century.\n Persians stormed the lightly-populated region in 614 CE, taking Jerusalem from the Byzantines. Byzantine Emperor Heraclius reclaimed the impoverished city in 630. Shortly thereafter, and within a decade of Muhammad's death, Islamic forces attacked the Byzantine Christians. Having had been weakened by their ongoing conflict with the Persians, the Christians were forced out of Judea by the Muslims.\n Jerusalem was initially bypassed by the jihadists because they were more interested in looting Egypt. The city itself surrendered to a Muslim army in 638 CE. In order to demonstrate that their religion was superior to Judeo-Christianity, construction began almost immediately on the Dome of the Rock, placing it right in the middle of Yahweh's Temple Mount. Sophronicus, the patriarch of the city, burst into tears and wailed, \"Truly this is the Abomination of Desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet!\" While that was true, \"Islam's third holiest sight\" is also a testament to the fact that Islam is a complete fraud.\n After capturing Jerusalem, the Muslim raiding parties poured through the eastern and southern provinces of the Byzantine Empire. In the 640s Christian Armenia in the north and Egypt in the south, which was also Christian at the time, fell to Islamic swords. In 655 CE, the Muslims very nearly captured the Byzantine emperor.\n By 711 Muslims had conquered and were now occupying all of northern Africa. It was then that a Muslim commander named Tariq set foot on European soil - on a rock that took his name. Jebel al-Tariq was corrupted into Gibraltar. In 712 CE, Muslim armies penetrated deep into Catholic Spain. At the battle of Toledo that year, they defeated the Spanish and killed their king. Surviving Christians retreated into the mountains in the northwestern part of the country. In that the refugees escaped with their lives and not their possessions, the plundering Islamic barbarians bypassed them and began raiding across the Pyrenees into France.\n Meanwhile, in the East, Muslims continued to attack the Byzantine Empire. In 717 they had a significant foothold in southeastern Europe and controlled the Balkans. With the Christian's surrounded, the Muslims continued their siege on the Byzantine capital, Constantinople - named after the founder of the Catholic religion. Had they taken the city at that time, they might have conquered the entire continent, but the Byzantines held out. The Christian capital would not fall to Islam until 1453. And it would be 200 years after the occupation of Istanbul that Islamic expansion would be finally halted with the unsuccessful Muslim sieges of Vienna in 1529 and again in 1683. Western resistance, that had been galvanized by Islam's one-thousand-year crusade against them, finally forced the Muslims to retreat from lands they had stolen and occupied in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\n The first meaningful success in that resistance occurred when Western European Christians stopped the Muslim advance into their territory in 732 (100 years after Muhammad's death) at the Battle of Tours (or Poitiers), France. Charles of Heristal, Charlemagne's grandfather, led a Frankish army against a large Muslim raiding party and defeated them. Though Muslim militants would continue attacking French communities for decades, their conquest of France was halted. For his victory, Charles of Heristal became known as the Hammer, or in French, Charles Martel.\n After regrouping, Muslim forces began to move into south-central Europe, launching invasions of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica in 827 CE. They attacked the Italian mainland as well. In 846 Muslim raiders assaulted the outlying areas of Rome, the capital of Roman Catholicism. This aggressive act was comparable to Christians sacking Mecca, something they have never done.\n Toward the end of the ninth century, Muslim pirate havens were established along the coast of southern France, Italy, and northern Africa. These Islamic raiders threatened commerce, communication, and pilgrim traffic for many centuries. In fact, the first militant attack perpetrated against the United States of America was by Muslim pirates off the coast of Tripoli, vexing Thomas Jefferson who was at the time Secretary of State.\n During the tenth century, the brutal tide finally began to turn - albeit slowly. In the East in the 950s and 960s, the Byzantines mounted a series of counterattacks. They eventually recovered the islands of Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims and substantial territory in Asia Minor and northern Syria, including Antioch. They lacked the strength to retake Jerusalem, however, though they might have struggled harder had they known what terrors the city would soon face.\n In 1000 CE, much, if not most, of the population of the Holy Land was still Christian, but this was about to change. A Muslim ruler named Hakim persecuted Christians and Jews, terrorizing them. He made it an Islamic duty to steal their homes, land, and possessions. In 1009 he ordered the burning of the rebuilt Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem as well as the destruction of every remaining synagogue, church, temple, or shine.. The Christian population of the Holy Land began to shrink dramatically under his tyrannical and oppressive rule.\n The Byzantines, distressed by the damage to their second most revered religious site, negotiated with the Muslims and in 1038 were allowed to begin rebuilding. But there were not enough Christians left in Judea to complete the work. And it didn't matter anyway. The next Muslim ruler destroyed what had been repaired.\n At the same time, the Seljuk Turks rose from the steppes of central Asia. In 1055, the barbarian hoard captured Baghdad, sacking the Muslim capital, but not the Islamic religion. Recognizing the inspiration Islam provided to those who plundered and raped, pillaged and killed, the Seljuk Turks converted to Islam. Repressive and ruthless Arab Muslims were thus replaced by an even more foul breed of terrorist.\n In 1071, Byzantine Emperor Romanus Diogenes confronted a Turkish Muslim Seljuk invasion into the far eastern provinces of his empire. The two armies met at the village of Manzikert, near Lake Van. The Christians were completely wiped out by the Muslims. As a result, the Byzantines lost all the territory that they had recovered in the ninth and tenth centuries, including the entirety of Asia Minor, the breadbasket of the empire.\n Succeeding Byzantine emperors sent frantic calls to the West for aid, hoping that the popes and other potentates would help them fight the onslaught of Islam before all was lost. Pope Gregory VII received these appeals first, and in 1074 he discussed leading a relief expedition to Byzantium himself. But, with the church divided and lacking the means, he did nothing. Then with the clock about to strike midnight, the Byzantines appeal found an audience with Pope Urban II.\n Let's pause a moment and reflect. During the first 3,100 years of recorded history, from 2,500 BCE to 600 CE, there isn't a single written record to be found anywhere in the world that depicts Arabs leaving Arabia to terrorize, conquer, plunder, or control anyone. Then, starting in 622 CE Muhammad announced the beginning of the Islamic Era. At its inception, according to the earliest Islamic sources, he and the first Muslims: \"Pledged to wage war on all mankind.\" In Islam's first decade, Allah's lone voice and the religion's singular prophet, personally led 75 terrorist raids - the last of which was against the Byzantines. Allah's Messenger aggressively attacked, terrorized, plundered, rapped, enslaved, beguiled or murdered everyone within his reach.\n Upon his death in 632, there was a fight for power between Abu Bakr, Muhammad's father-in-law (the man who provided the 50-year-old sexual pervert with his 9-year-old daughter) and Ali, Muhammad's adopted son and son-in-law. Bakr won, creating the Sunni-Shia rift. After confiscating Muhammad's stolen treasury, Islam's first Caliph started the War of Compulsion, forcing every Arab to surrender to Islam - the religion of Submission. Over the course of the next ten years, these once peaceful, self-sustaining people, now corrupted by Islam, became the world's most ruthless and covetous barbarians. They savaged everything in their wake, beginning with Yemen, Persia, the Byzantine province of Syria, today's Jordan, Israel, and Egypt.\n Then over the course of the next 90 years the sword of Islam was wielded over the heads of Indians, Africans, and Europeans. And that is not the end of the story. Today, with OPEC funding, the rebirth of fundamentalist Islam is once again terrorizing the world. Muslims following Muhammad's example commit 95% of the planet's terrorist acts. So I ask you, what corrupted these people and made them so covetous and violent if not Islam? And since that question was rhetorical, why do politicians and the media apologize for and accommodate a dogma that is this deadly?\n History confirms with great clarity that Muslims, beginning with Muhammad, launched their conquest of Christendom one-thousand years before the Europeans responded rather feebly with their Crusades. Yet today, Muslim propagandists want the world to believe that the West stole Islamic lands and that Christians alone are imperialistic. This mindset is used to fool fools into believing that Muslims fight Christians because Christians have fought Muslims. Those who deceive don't want you to know that Christians were victims, not villains in this affair or that Islam alone is why Muslims kill.\n And yet, despite all of the evidence to the contrary, Islam is presented as innocent and passive. The religion is seldom if ever held accountable for the terrorism it inspires. Even when so-called experts discuss terror in the context of the religion they universally apply the qualifier \"radical\" to Islam, suggesting that a corrupted form of the doctrine is to blame for its carnage when the opposite is true. But to have access to the media and to sell books one must be willing to lie. This suicidal pathology is born out of Socialist Secular Humanism and its campaign against Christian values.\n While I wrote extensively on the Crusades, condemning them in the context of Yahshua's prophetic Revelation letters in Yada Yahweh, they are but a pimple on a camel's behind when compared to the onslaught of the Islamic war machine that began ravaging the world in 622 CE - and never stopping. In Muhammad's last terrorist campaign, after pummeling every Jew within his reach and plundering every Arab worth robbing, Allah's Messenger assembled 30,000 mujahideen jihadists to attack the Byzantine civilian community of Tabuk. That assault, along with the conquest of Mecca, is described in the Qur'an's final surahs, the 9th and 5th. They define Islam - labeling any Muslim who does not fight \"a hypocrite, worthy of death.\" These surahs also introduce the Jizyah tax, which the Qur'an says non-Muslims must pay in abject humility - or lose their lives. Islam's message was simple and direct: convert to Islam, pay the debilitating \"protection\" tax, or die.\n In this context, Muhammad led 75 terrorist raids to finance his new religion. It is why the Qur'an's 8th surah opens with the line: \"Booty is lawful and good.\" It became the mantra of the Islamic crusades - the reason behind the 1000 year assault. Stolen property and the slave trade enabled the first Muslims to acquire more weapons and to bribe more men into joining their ruthless religion. Nothing has changed. But an empire built on brutality turns on itself if the barbarians are not constantly given an enemy to hate and victims to plunder.",

   "Now can we have some arguments of your own. When you post huge links of copy-pastes, which you usually don't bother reading yourself, you make discussion difficult because unclear what, if anything, you're actually arguing.\n\n \n I did post my opinion Jo, I even did it in bolded, did you miss that? And then I supported my opinion with linked facts regarding the extensive history of radical islamic attacks going back not only 200 years to when Jefferson was our President, but to the birth of islam and how this activity is culturally born into this violent cult with Mohammed as the example and justification for what islam represents today as it did in its infancy. \n \n \nIn any case, thanks for confirming that you advocate the use of force rather than a Christian approach to dealing with people who hate you.\n\n \n Wrong again Jo, and more evidence of your ignorance regarding what the bible says about individuals and a nations response to those who hate us. I personally deal with hateful people with love and forgiveness in my personal life. I don't physically attack or fight with people who disagree with me, nor do I condone personal violence on any level between people who disagree with each other.\n \n Islam on the other hand, whom you are defending and who's violence you are attempting to justify do exactly that as a normal course and philosophical principle. They encourage individuals to participate in personal Jihads against anyone who disagrees with the total submission to allah on an individual basis. They also form organized groups in order to make larger attacks against larger groups. This is precisely what TTT THREATENS in his post and you still defend the principle. He threatens to attack us like cowards and you are too ignorant to be offended by the tact of using terrorism as a form of political discourse.\n \n So my so called advocating of the use of force is actually advocating the use of self defense as a NATION since we have received Fatwa's signed in blood by radical islam who have vowed to either convert us or destroy us. You are incapable of comprehending the different standards God has for responding to individual violence and National defense which the Government exists for, in order to insure the safety of its citizens. I repeat my links which you find so tedious.\n \n WoJ - Muslim violence against America began in 1801\n \n Prophet of Doom - Islamic Terrorism Timeline - Introduction - Islamic Terrorism Timeline",
