   "First of all, I would just like to say that for me, it's always a pleasure disproving evolution. I mean disproving literally trillions and trillions of hours of research by individuals who have an uncanny ability to misrepresent the evidence is - well - just a special feeling.\n \n But what's even more gratifying is when I can do it in such a way that is so incredibly indesputable, that even a kindergartner can understand it, and the most brilliant Phd can't refute it. \n \n On the other post I showed you, despite what is taught, how all degernative diseases are actually ONE disease, and most are genetically related, or at the very least strongly correlated. Cancer is related to diabetes; MS is related to arthritis, diabetes is related to mental disease, depression is linked to inflammatory bowel disease etc etc etc etc. Type in any disease in the Google window with the words \"linked to\" after it and you'll see what I mean.\n \n And like I said, all these diseases are a product of the same source, inflammation. Likewise, go to Google and type in any degenerative disease with the word \"inflammation\" behind it....you'll find every one of them is a product of inflammation. Inflammation, of course is a product of stress, stress is a product of stress hormones, stress hormones are released when a diet high in sugar and carbs are consumed.\n \n What's interesting, though, is the physical effect that these diseases have on one's body - specifically the brain.\n \n Neanderthals are considered by the scientific community as a side branch of our family tree that went extinct. The reason that they are said to have gone extinct was because their morphology - specifically the size and contour of their skull -- seemed to be \"replaced\" by modern morphology in a relatively short amount of time - way too short for standard evolutionary mechanisms to be at work. (Neanderthals' cranial capacity was about 200 cc higher than ours) Thus, in order to prove human evolution, the evolutionists had to convince people that the Neanderthals simply died out, only to be overtaken by \"normal\" humans. \n \n But the reality is, Neanderthals were probably just a nomadic people. They were probably the first people to inhabit Europe....and for many years, being hunters, these people probably consumed a diet high in protein and very low in sugars and carbs....and this diet probably preserved the way God initially created the human brain. (The human body does not function correctly on a diet high in sugar)\n \n But over time, as more and more people (families) moved into the areas Neanderthals occupied, towns and communities formed, agriculture got its start, and no doubt lots of cooking and baking commenced. Of course baking probably included the making of breads, sweets, and soft foods. Thus, as more and more babies were born in society, and these babies grew up consuming a diet higher in sugar, carbohydrates, and alcohol, their morphologies changed. My contention is that sugar is the culprit. Sugar leads to a release of stress hormones...stress hormones result in inflammation. Inflammation and stress can alter the physiology of the human brain.\n \n Did you know that long-term stress shrinks the brain?\n \n http://www.webmd.com/content/article/106/108114.htm\n \n Did you know obesity shrinks the brain? \n \n Did you know that Alzheimer's disease shrinks the brain? \n \n Did you know that diabetes shrinks the brain?\n \n Did you know that Depression shrinks the brain?\n \n Did you know that chronic back pain (degenerative disease) shrinks the brain?\n \n Did you know that alcohol shrinks the brain?\n \n Did you know that smoking shrinks the brain?\n \n Did you know that exercise can prevent alzheimer's?\n \n http://www.ahealthyme.com/topic/alzlifestyle \n \n \"This study adds to growing evidence that moderate exercise is the closest thing we have to a magic wellness bullet for everyone,\" said William Thies\n \n And could this be the fact that exercise reduces stress and inflammation? Surely nobody here denies that exercise reduces stress and that a reduction in stress would reduce inflammation.\n \n But not only do these diseases shrink the brain as whole....they shrink the brain in many interesting areas that could effect external morphology. One is the anterior cingulate cortex...the other is the frontal lobe. The other is the hippocampus. Stress actually has a tendency to bring on atrophy all over the brain. \n \n http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/02/060228090104.htm\n \n regarding the anterior cingulate cortex\n \n Doctors analysed stress hormone levels and brain volume in two groups of ten healthy male volunteers aged 65-70 for the study. Lead author Dr Alasdair MacLullich said: \"Doctors have known for several years that ageing, and certain diseases common in ageing like Alzheimer's disease and depression, can be associated with shrinkage of the brain, but this is the first time we have been able to show that increased levels of stress hormones may cause shrinkage of this critical area of the brain.\n \n \n Neanderthals have long been ridiculed as brutes because of the size and shape of their brain.\n \n I don't think I need to prove to this board with links that depression and anxiety and heart disease and cancer run in families. It's coming out that these diseases are inherited epigenetically. This of course, is a neo-lamarckian-style inheritence of acquired characteristics.\n \n So if all these diseases are inherited epigenetically, it's not too much of a stretch to consider that the morphology that lends itself to these diseases (smaller, more rounded brains) are also inherited. You probably already know that parents with big noses have a tendency to give birth to kids with big noses. Parents who go bald are likely to give birth to kids who grow up to be bald. Likewise, parents who are obnoxious and and unruly are likely to give birth to kids who are obnoxious and unruly. Likewise parents who are dumb are likely to give birth to kids who are dumb. So all kinds of traits are inherited. The study of disease is showing that these traits are inherited epigenetically.\n \n Of course, what this means is that the concept of evolution is falsified. Evolutionists have allocated hundreds of thousnds of years for humans to evolve via RM + NS. But this time-frame is not necessary. Instead, the window for human evolution has shrunk exponentially. And this only makes sense considering there are only a few hundreds Neanderthal bones found - and just a few thousand total fossil homind bones found. The sheer number of bones unearthed does not lend itself to an evolution of a population which would require tens of millions of individuals. (remember, beneficial random mutations only occur in 1 in every mutli-million individuals....at best.)\n \n And of course this concept of the human population changing rapidly mirrors what we see in today's society. Look at society. I've given links that show skulls are quickly getting smaller. Also, people are growing taller and getting fatter. Kids are born with diseases such as Adhd and childhood depression. Obesity is an epidemic. Likewise, unruly behavior is an epidemic. \n \n Society is indeed going genetically down hill. It started thousands of years ago and it continues today. It's getting worse and worse and there's no way to reverse it. The more people consume diets high in sugar, carbs, fried foods, and alcohol, the more our brains will continue to shrink and become mal-shaped - which further opens us up for diseases - diseases that will get passed on to our kids and their kids.\n \n Of course, all this means that our morphology has not changed because of standard evolutionary mechanism....which states that we changed because new skulls were simply \"selected,\" despite having no proof that the Neanderthals starved or were killed off. \n \n This revelation that our traits are molded by diet and environment, disproves the evolution of new traits by way of RM + NS...which falsifies the evolution of humans.\n \n \n Chinese people's heads becoming smaller \n \n http://english.people.com.cn/200608/17/eng20060817_294183.html\n \n Researchers from the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology (IVPP) at the Research Center for Chinese Frontier Archaeology, a branch of the Chinese Academy of Science at Jilin University, have found that in the last 10,000 years, the physical characteristics of Chinese people have undergone many changes. \n \n Dr. Wu Xue Jie from the IVPP said experts in the research team tested, analyzed and compared 718 skulls belonging to Chinese adult males who lived during the New Stone Age, the Bronze Age and modern times. They discovered that Chinese people's craniums and viscerocraniums are getting smaller; their noses and eye sockets are becoming narrower; and their skulls are becoming more rounded. \n \n The reason people's skulls grew smaller during the Holocene epoch are not known and this will be the subject of further study. However, Dr. Lu believes the changes are most likely related to climate, flow of population, production systems and lifestyle. By People's Daily Online (all they have to do is read this post to learn why skulls are getting smaller.)\n \n Checkmate, brother.....\n \n http://www.amazon.com/Neanderthals-...m/dp/0300080247\n \n (neanderthals seemed to \"disappear\" as soon as communities formed and large-scale farming began -- which no-doubt led to cooking and softer foods)",

First of all....I do not claim that brain size has anything to do with being human. A human brain can be small, large, fat, or skinny -- and it would still be a human brain. It's much like the other apects of our bodies. Would you call someone less human if they were 4 ft tall or 9 feet tall? Fat? Skinny? \n \n But what you have to remember is that many of the homo erectus remains have been found where Asian people reside today. If you look at this population today you will see generally smaller people than in the west. Chinese people are generally short with small features....as are most asians. What causes this I do not know. It would be worth investigating. Regardless though, homo erectus has been called \"little Neanderthals\" by some paleontologists...and that's because the shape of their heads is much the same as neanderthals' heads, only smaller. This would imply that homo erectus probably were nomads, like neanderthals were, and ate a diet mostly of fish or meat....little baked goods. Something else must have been causing their bodies to remain small. The recent hobbits' bodies are extrememly small. There's got to be a reason.\n \n My hunch is it's temperature. If you'll notice, people who have been living in africa for many generations tend to be very tall and thin, while those who live in arctic areas (eskimos for example) are small and pudgy so they can store body heat better. I think that the climate of the area has a lot to do with height, and peoples build. Of course asia is not a cold climate -- at least not today -- but in the past it may have been cool or rainy or overcast.",

One of them wins you the Nobel prize, the other happens only on the inside of your head :)\n \n \nLike I said, I showed you the link of the Chinese people and the exact same thing is said -- that smaller, rounder skulls are a trend in chinese people in the past 10,000 years. What exactly is your argument? I'm simply giving you a possible mechanism. What would be your explanation? RM + NS could never do that in 10,000 years....not enough time.\n\n \n Actually it's perfectly capable of producing effects over that sort of timescale, and in this case RM isn't actually required to have occurred; variations in skull shape are already distributed across the population. This change might simply reflect changing patterns of interbreeding that have brought those traits together in parents more often. Moreover, RM+NS are not the only mechanisms for change in Darwinian evolution. Sexual selection can impose differential breeding rates - check out birds of paradise, for instance; all those bright colours and wacky behaviour aren't an inherently beneficial survival trait, but they do influence reproductive success. Then there's always the possibility that the skull shape (which by itself might not be significant) is linked to the possession of some other trait that does confer an advantage. Or then again it might just be random genetic drift playing silly buggers with us, like in the case of the Israeli fighter pilots who had 90% female children: look for patterns and you will find them.\n \n \nEpigenetics has also shown that a mother's diet affects the phenotype of her children.\n\n \n Yes, but not when she's 60 :)\n \n \nNo I'm not. Was McDonalds and KFC around eons ago? Diets are much worse now. I'm just saying farming got the ball rolling with new morphologies.\n\n \n But there's no global correlation between sugary diets and smaller craniums. Until a few hundred years ago the whole world was in more or less the same dietary boat, and Chinese people today have far less sugar in their diets than westerners.\n \n \nYou've not way of explaining how the future medical condition of the parent magically alters the phenotype of children they've already had,\n \n You are losing credibility to debate when you sink to this level of stupidity. I neither said nor implied this is possible. If a child is born, the only way his phenotype can change is if it's self-induced.\n\n \n Actually that's exactly what you were implying, by saying that effects induced by diet - effects that only manifest late in life - were being inherited by children. If you're retracting that statement and saying instead that children inherit the sensitivity to that diet, well, we're back to Darwinism again, with genes determining susceptibility.\n \n \nPlus you aren't willing to entertain the idea of evolution,\n \n yea I am...I just don't admit that traits are accidents. What so hard for you to understand about this? I'm simply saying there is a cause for traits -- and the cause is diet/environment.\n\n \n So you're not denying we evolved from a common ancestor with apes, you're just saying we ate our way here? Fair enough :)\n \n \nThat's a good question. First of all....I do not claim that brain size has anything to do with being human. A human brain can be small, large, fat, or skinny -- and it would still be a human brain.\n\n \n What, like walnut-sized? Pea-sized? There's no point at which you would concede it's no longer human?\n \n \nThis would imply that homo erectus probably were nomads, like neanderthals were, and ate a diet mostly of fish or meat....little baked goods. Something else must have been causing their bodies to remain small. The recent hobbits' bodies are extrememly small. There's got to be a reason.\n\n \n SS, they inherited the physical traits of their parents. Can't you see the same when you look at your own parents? Did that happen because you ate the same food as them? Do you really think that if a child of westerners is born in China and eats chinese food it's going to look chinese?\n \n I think what's getting you all confused and excited is that there are a number of overlapping mechanisms at work here, and the effects of one can to the untrained eye look a bit like the effects of another. But you still haven't really made any useful progress towards ancestrally separating humans from chimps. The grossest extremes of human and chimp morphologies do not bridge the gap that the morphological progression of skulls in the fossil record fills. That progression is confirmatory evidence - it's what we would expect to find - but it's not the whole story. Come back when you have a dietary explanation for identically broken pseudogenes in chimps and humans :)",

Genes don't even control the cells they reside in...how can we expect them to control the rest of the body?\n \n Because we've observed this happening? The enzyme that transcribes DNA recognises specific sequences upstream of the genes and attachs itself to these - you could demonstrate this by producing a chain of DNA in a random assortment and one that resembles the region you think the enzyme attachs to and then seeing what happens when you add enzyme. If it matchs the sequence the enzyme recognises it binds to the DNA, if its different then it will just wash off - the closer the sequence is to the ideal sequence the polymerase binds to the more likely it will attach. This is how organisms like bacteria vary the expression of a lot of their protein.\n Eukaryotic organisms are a bit trickier as the RNA polymerase doesn't bind directly to the DNA but to other proteins called transcription factors, but its the same principle of expression being controlled by DNA.

You are living in a fairytale.\n \n Sean Carroll:\n \n Comparison of genomes tell us that not only do flies and humans share a large set of developmental genes, but that mice and humans havenearly identical sets of about 25,000 genes, and that chimps and humans are almost 99 percent (SS: try 94%) identical at the DNA level. The common tool kit and the great similarities among different species genomes present an apparent paradox. Since the sets of genes are so widely shared, how do differences arise?  Endless Forms Most Beautiful Pg. 79\n \nGenome comparisons are interesting, but pretty meaningless. Eukaryotic organisms have a many more proteins than they have genes, but this isn't due to the DNA not encoding the proteins but because of Alternative Splicing. They don't give us a lot of information either without being put into context of how they did it - if they took the whole genome then inactive pseudogenes are going to appear to be almost identical to an active gene even though one isn't even expressed, on top of that you've got the various repeated elements that aren't expressed but still found in closely related species pushing up that number of identical sections. If they just looked at the genes then they are neglecting the regions controlling gene expression and the fact that both m-RNA and translated proteins can be modified to produce two very different proteins from the same gene.",

   "  Tastyfish : Because we've observed this happening? \n \n You've observed what? The elements that control gene expression? That's a great trick!\nLets just set this straight - there are two parts to control of gene expression, one is the sequence of DNA that precedes a gene and one is an RNA polyermase enzyme or transcription factor.

The various bases of DNA have slightly different 'shapes' and these 'shapes' correspond to a groove on the enzyme - if a sequence of DNA is the right 'shape' to fit into the groove, these regions of the RNA polymerase will bind to the DNA. This will then bend the DNA molecule and cause the two strands to come apart underneath the transcribing part of the enzyme. The enzyme then adds individual RNA to the DNA strand to build up the mRNA strand that will later \n \n Can you observe that \"element\" too?\n Yes, its just a sequence of DNA - well actually two sequences of DNA, one that starts 35 bases from the start of the gene and one that starts 10 bases from the start of the gene. Its very easy to modify these and observe the effects on gene expression, the closer you make these two regions to the enzymes favoured sequence the more often it will bind and begin transcription\n \n Where does this enzyme come from?....DNA sends it?\n Nothing 'sends' it, the enzyme just moves along the DNA strands until it finds one of the sequences it recognises then begins transcription. Being made of protein it is encoded itself within the DNA, there are genes for RNA polyermase within every organisms genome.

   "I was really just explaining how gene expression can be controlled by DNA, rather than using the components of the process to illustrate evolution. The DNA and RNA polymerases are ancient enzymes and probably among the first to appear, but various types of polymerases closely resemble each other across kingdoms (mitochondrial/chloropast polymerases and archael polymerases, eukaryote polymerase I and prokaryote polyermases). I'm a bit sketchy on the details when you get that far back and not quite sure where they would come into the RNA -< DNA worlds idea, or when and how they would replace ribozymes, that sort of thing is covered by evolutionary biologists and I'm more of a molecular geneticist. Its not something I've covered and I know its something you don't believe anyway - start an origins of life thread and I'm sure you'll get a more informed reply though, just remember to avoid implying that a non-supernatural origin of life is essential for evolution to occur and they'll be able to concentrate more on the points you make. Apparently there have been some recent studies on the earth's atmosphere that suggest that the Miller-Urey experiments were more relevant than was previously thought.\n \n \nNothing 'sends' it, \n \n then what's the role the endocrine system?\n\n The endocrine systems is only present in large multicellular organisms. Its a way for different types of tissues and organs to interact with one another, its not really something that has much of a role within a single cell. Also since all organisms with an endocrine system are eukaryotes, transcription is a bit more complicated as the polyermase enzyme only attachs to the DNA after a whole series of other DNA binding proteins have gotten involved (uncoiling the DNA from its tightly wound storage form, transcription factors binding to the DNA so another transcription factor can bind to it as the polymerase won't respond to the first protein). \n \n On top of this, quite often the hormones that make up the endocrine system will quite often not react with DNA at all but be involved with activating or deactivating proteins that have already been synthesised. \n \n \n\n the enzyme just moves along the DNA strands until it finds one of the sequences it recognises then begins transcription.\n \n do you deny that the action of the enzyme is under control of the cell? Do you deny that the cell turns enzymes On or Off as it needs them?\n\n Whilst the process of gene expression is controlled by the cell, the enzyme itself isn't - the cell exerts control at other stages, hiding the enzyme's targets, removing the products as soon as they are made or requiring the end product\n \n \nI think you think you know about life...and you appear to know about how some things work, but you are not addressing the underlying \"force\", for lack of a better word, that put these processes in motion. I cannot believe, you, being in your line of work cannot see the staggering complexity and intelligence in the cell. The cell is so mind-blowingly complex, it could have never come together by chance. Do you disagree?\n\n I don't really know, its a hard concept to get your head round because we think and experience the world on such a different scale. The cell as a whole is mind-blowingly complex yet at each individual step is simple and easy to understand - to an extent its a bit like a magic trick, you're presented with something that seems to defy understanding, but when you have the individual steps revealed you realise that nothing mysterious is going on and you can now recognise similar things in other tricks and do them yourself. \n \n I suppose there is really two ways you can go after looking at things like these, one route is to disbelief that anything this complicated could arise on its own and the other is to see 'intelligence' as we think of it in a different light - as something much less epic and powerful than the simple rules that allow the universe to work.",

This is not some magical cell-intelligence driven control mechanism, it's a consequence of increasing product concentration (sometimes coupled with allosteric sites). If you were to isolate such an enzyme and measure its activity in environments of varying concentrations of substrates and products, you would see the same effect -- independent of cells. To say that such enzyme activity is \"under the control of the cell\" is... er, I'll be really, really kind: disingenuous.\n This is, however, a far cry from gene regulation.\n \n \n\n Most biochemical reactions in a cell are not executed in just one step.
