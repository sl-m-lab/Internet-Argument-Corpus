   "To all of you who want to fight for gay rights. Here is a chance to put pressure on a goverment which is about to vote on a law proposing to include gays in the discrimination law. The proposal fell a couple of months ago, but maybe, just maybe with a little bit of pressure they willl pass it. Help change this stone age government/country in the midst of Europe.\n \n \n Act Against Homophobia (AAH) is an initiative caused by the Faroese government's homophobic legislation. The Faroese government refuses, for instance, to legislate \n against discrimination of people because of their sexual preferences. This means that in the Faroe Islands, discrimination of homosexuals is \n perfectly legal according to the law. \n \n This signature collection campaign has been launched to show the Faroese government and parliament, that the surrounding world does not find discriminating acts against homosexuals acceptable, whether or not they are committed in the name of Christianity. This country's current legislation is a strong violation of The United Nations' Declaration of Human Rights.\n \n Unfortunately, right now violence and discrimination against people who have spoken up about their homosexuality in public is not uncommon in the Faroe Islands. And because there is no law to protect the homosexual \n minority against such discrimination, it is often considered legal and acceptable to commit these actions against homosexuals.\n \n Take action against discrimination of homosexuals and sign the AAH\n \n All signatures will be sent to the Faroese Government.\n \n Thank you!\n \n http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html",
