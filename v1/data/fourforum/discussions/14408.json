He deserves 90% of the blame.\n\n \n The unemployment number peaked at about 9,300,000 under Bush in July of 2003 before steadily declining down to a little over 8,000,000 by the end of his presidency (the all time low between July 2003 and the end of Bush\\'s presidency was a little over 7,000,000. Bush\\'s Presidency never saw more than 10,000,000 unemployed. Suddenly there are over 16,000,000 unemployed within two years of Obama\\'s presidency, and you think that can be blamed on Bush? Towards the end of Bush\\'s presidency, the unemployment rate was increasing, but at least at a relatively steady rate. It wasn\\'t skyrocketing.\n \n \n Do you really think it\\'s coincidence that the unemployment rate nearly doubled after the Stimulus bill was passed? \n \nHe began the crash, which spiraled out of control right as he left.\n\n You do? emoticon_wow\n \n \nAnd now all of a sudden Obama is being blamed for the crash?\n\n \n Of course, unless you can explain how Bush left his catastrophic mark on the economy as Obama passed the stimulus.\n \n \nSo far, he hasn\\'t fixed something that someone else smashed beyond repair.\n\n \n I\\'ve already explained that the unemployment peak under Obama was almost twice what it was under Bush. So unless you can explain how Bush\\'s policies took effect immediately after Obama passed the stimulus, I think it\\'d make more sense to conclude that the sharp incline in unemployment was caused by Obama\\'s stimulus package.\n \n \nWith something so badly damaged, don\\'t be surprised if it takes time.\n\n \n And, using your analogy, if someone is bleeding from bullet wounds, don\\'t be surprised when shooting them again only makes the problem worse.\n \n \nYou don\\'t know that.\n\n \n Yes I do. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nWe could simply be feeling further repercussions from Bush\\'s mistakes.\n\n \n If you can name the policy.

   "[QUOTE=COBHC;406997]How so? Bush spent money. Obama spent money. Why is Bush's spending \"messing up the economy,\" but Obama's spending is an \"attempt to fix it?\" Like Symbiote said earlier:\n \n For two reasons: One, Bush's spent a lot more than Obama, and two, we're still spending a lot of money on the wars that Bush started.\n \n \nIf government spending causes a problem, more Government spending won't help fix it. Using your analogy, if someone is shot six times, you can't save them by shooting them six more times.\n\n \n Like I said, I'm not an economist. But from what I remember, isn't government spending what nearly brought us out of the depression?\n \n \n \nYes I do. If the stimulus package had worked, the unemployment rate wouldn't have accelerated once it was passed. Bush's presidency never saw such a long, sharp increase of the unemployment rate.\n\n \n That's because the effects of Bush's economic mistakes are still being felt.\n \n \n \n \nWho says it doesn't?\n\n \n I didn't see you mention Bush.\n \n \nOnce again, you make it sound like Obama's policies have had a nuetral effect or no effect on the economy. In fact, they've accelerated the growth of the unemployment rate. Unless you can name me a policy Bush passed at the last second of his presidency that would've caused such a steep rise in the unemployment rate, causing it to rise more than it ever did under Bush.\n\n \n It looks to me like the fiscal stimulus played a major role in reducing the depth of the recession. 650,000 jobs have been created or saved by the Stimulus fund. The economy is in chaos right now. Why is it in chaos? Because of Bush. He made it plummet, and Obama is being blamed for it.\n \n \nThe unemployment number peaked at about 9,300,000 under Bush in July of 2003 before steadily declining down to a little over 8,000,000 by the end of his presidency (the all time low between July 2003 and the end of Bush's presidency was a little over 7,000,000. Bush's Presidency never saw more than 10,000,000 unemployed. Suddenly there are over 16,000,000 unemployed within two years of Obama's presidency, and you think that can be blamed on Bush? Towards the end of Bush's presidency, the unemployment rate was increasing, but at least at a relatively steady rate. It wasn't skyrocketing.\n\n \n And how do you know that skyrocket can't be attributed to the damage Bush had done? Simple because he wasn't sitting in the Oval office anymore?\n \n \n \nDo you really think it's coincidence that the unemployment rate nearly doubled after the Stimulus bill was passed? \n \n You do? emoticon_wow\n \n \n Of course, unless you can explain how Bush left his catastrophic mark on the economy as Obama passed the stimulus.\n \n I've already explained that the unemployment peak under Obama was almost twice what it was under Bush. So unless you can explain how Bush's policies took effect immediately after Obama passed the stimulus, I think it'd make more sense to conclude that the sharp incline in unemployment was caused by Obama's stimulus package.\n\n \n No, it's still reasonable to say that the unemployment rate would be even higher if the stimulus package wasn't passed.\n \n \n \n \nAnd, using your analogy, if someone is bleeding from bullet wounds, don't be surprised when shooting them again only makes the problem worse.\n\n \n Obama was trying to fix the economy, not shoot it in the heart, which is why that is a false analogy.\n \n \n \nYes I do. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n No, you don't. \n \n \nIf you can name the policy. I can. It's called \"the Stimulus Package\", as the unemployment rate has nearly doubled since it was passed.\n\n \n Really? Because I think it's called something else.\n \n \nIf Bush's policies were so catastrophic, then why is it that the unemployment rate is nearly twice as high as it was during the peak of unemployment under the Bush administration? If Bush's policies were so catastrophic, then why didn't we see the effects towards the end of his administration? Can you explain how Bush caused unemployment rate to rise the very second Obama started spending?\n\n \n You mean aside from the housing crisis, the Iraq war, the massive deficit, awarding the rich with tax cuts, and beginning the cycle of inflation and unemployment? If that's not \"catastrophic\" to you then I don't know what is. We saw the effects throughout the beginning and end of his term as well as after. Citing a sudden spike in the unemployment rate (a number that is temperamental and hard to predict) as proof of Obama's incompetence is flimsy at best.",

Supporters hail the change as the long-overdue demise of a Depression-era relic. \n \n On Oct. 21, with the House-Senate conference committee deadlocked after marathon negotiations, the main sticking point is partisan bickering over the bill's effect on the Community Reinvestment Act, which sets rules for lending to poor communities. Sandy Weill calls President Clinton in the evening to try to break the deadlock after Senator Phil Gramm, chairman of the Banking Committee, warned Citigroup lobbyist Roger Levy that Weill has to get White House moving on the bill or he would shut down the House-Senate conference. Serious negotiations resume, and a deal is announced at 2:45 a.m. on Oct. 22. Whether Weill made any difference in precipitating a deal is unclear. \n \n On Oct. 22, Weill and John Reed issue a statement congratulating Congress and President Clinton, including 19 administration officials and lawmakers by name. The House and Senate approve a final version of the bill on Nov. 4, and Clinton signs it into law later that month. \n \n Just days after the administration (including the Treasury Department) agrees to support the repeal, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the former co-chairman of a major Wall Street investment bank, Goldman Sachs, raises eyebrows by accepting a top job at Citigroup as Weill's chief lieutenant. The previous year, Weill had called Secretary Rubin to give him advance notice of the upcoming merger announcement. When Weill told Rubin he had some important news, the secretary reportedly quipped, \"You're buying the government?\" \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/wallstreet/weill/demise. html\n\n \n There has been a chipping away at the corrective measures (Glass-Steagall) put into place after the first Great Depression. & then even before that, there was Reagan (perhaps unwittingly?) orchestrating the savings-and-loan scandal of the 1980's: \n \n \nMost emblematic of the Reaganite attitude toward government was the savings-and-loan scandal. The president's advisors had convinced him that if he would only deregulate the thrift industry, a gigantic bonanza of growth and investment was sure to follow. His sunny quip when he signed the deregulation bill in 1982 was typical Reagan: \"All in all, I think we've hit the jackpot.\" There's no reason to doubt he sincerely believed that with government shoved aside, everyone would prosper. The best reckoning of the costs of his benign intentions is a trillion dollars.\n Reagan without sentimentality - Salon.com \n\n \n All in all, WHO hit the jackpot? \n \n Although if you want to play the 'blame game' - where do you make the cut off? Maybe the people who rebelled against tyranny are to blame. Maybe the founders are to blame? The nerve of them! Thinking you can have a government of the people & for the people! The nerve! Thinking a representative republic would be better than what they left! The noive!\n \n Let's face it, the American people in the present are to blame. The people who seek to legitimize or justify the con job are to blame. The ideologies that seek to legitimize or justify the con job are to blame. & so on.\n \n Even the 'bailouts' wouldn't be so bad if we were BUYING BACK THE GOVERNMENT. Sadly, without corrective measures (similar to Glass-Steagall) we are simply reinforcing the fact that our government has been sold to the largest bidder.\n \n Who hit the jackpot?

In fact, I think you're very confident that a democrat (possibly Barack Obama) will fix the economy.\n \n \n\n I haven't seen any evidence to convince me that the tooth fairy doesn't exist.\n\n \n So we should assume that she does? I repeat myself: I believe that Obama is responsible for the current increase in economic difficulties because I haven't seen any evidence to convince me otherwise. I just hear \"well maybe Bush is responsible!\" Sorry, but you can't blame increasing economic difficulties on Bush forever. The longer you use that argument, the more ridiculous it becomes.\n \n \nOf course he would. But would he go to war with another random, unrelated country and justify it with false claims? I don't think so.\n\n \n I was expecting you to use that argument. \n \n The most important thing about that claim is that it's irrelevant. Whether he went to war with the right people or not, money would still be spent. Terrorist groups are equally as resilient whether they were responsible for 9-11 or not. The economy in the US would be no different had Bush attacked the right people.\n \n But now that you've mentioned it, what makes you think Obama wouldn't do such a thing? Because he's a nice guy? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nOne president wastes money on hurting people, the other \"wastes\" money on helping people. I think I know the lesser of the two evils.\n\n \n Once again, you're making it sound like Bush intentionally caused economic difficulty.\n \n One guy hits people on the head with a hammer to hurt them, and the next guy hits them harder with the hammer to help them. There may be \"change,\" but that change will not be the result of hitting people with a hammer.\n \n Originally posted by Shooterandproud: I don't care what his intentions were. He screwed everything up, bigtime. As the president he should know better.\n \n \nThey didn't. The unemployment rate climbed during Bush too. Right now, the unemployment rate is 3% higher than it was under bush. A 3% increase can easily be attributed to other factors. The unemployment rate climbs and falls all the time. I wouldn't be so quick to blame the evil liberals.\n\n \n What? Leftists were rejoicing and praising Obama when 650,000 were supposedly created, for a total change in the unemployment rate of 0.2%, but 3% isn't significant? Three percent is 9,750,000 jobs. Not nearly an insignificant number that can be attributed to random fluctuations.\n \n MID-DAY UPDATE: Unemployment rate drops. Sounds good.
