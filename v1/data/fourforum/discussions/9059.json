That's because your founding fathers didn't like democracy at all. A true democracy would be nothing more than mob rule and the founding fathers knew that and created the constitutional republic which you now live in.\n \n Just because you vote doesn't mean you live in a democracy. Hell, they vote in China, does that mean that China is a democracy?\n\n \n Definitions of democracy:\n \n From wordnet.princeton.edu (found through google define)\n \"\n # the political orientation of those who favor government by the people or by their elected representatives\n # a political system in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who can elect people to represent them\n # majority rule: the doctrine that the numerical majority of an organized group can make decisions binding on the whole group \n \"\n \n from wikipedia\n \"\n The term democracy indicates a form of government where all the state's decisions are exercised directly or indirectly by a majority of its citizenry through a fair elective process. When these factors are met a government can be classified as such. This can apply to a multitude of government systems as these concepts transcend and often occur concomitantly with other types. \n \"\n \n Although the Constitution doesn't mention the term democracy, several times it mentions votes, such as 2/3, majority, etc. Representatives are (or are supposed to be) restricted to the powers set out by the Constitution. But they are elected representatives thus the United States IS a Democracy.",
