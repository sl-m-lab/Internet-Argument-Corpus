   "I moved away from Lubbock five days after my high school graduation! However, I have a younger brother who attends junior high in the Lubbock Independent School District. There is still an abstinence-only policy in the district, although my brother tells me that the school board may be forced to change that position after recent events. A fourteen year-old junior high school student tested positive for HIV and infected several other students with the virus. Lubbock news stations publicly blamed the district for its failure while teachers privately agreed. There are several groups that are organizing around this issue once again. One group with connections to local hospitals is looking into further educating parents so that they are prepared to provide their kids with accurate information regarding their sexuality. The students of GAP did not appeal the decision that denied them the right to post signs and meet in schools because of a legal technicality that would make it difficult to win. Students from Coronado High School, my high school, may bring a similar case against the school board early next school year. \n\n http://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2005/shelbyknox/update.html",

   "The main problem with that also is homework. I think it has been proven that homework doesn't drastically help kids, and we get a lot of busywork. It's sole purpose seems to be to fill up the day. As there is more and more homework, kids have less and less time to be a kid (play outside, etc.) and their parents teaching kids outside of school is frowned upon in schools, because they have to teach everyone the exact same thing so they can pass the tests. My parents were talking the other day about this. My little brother's math class is literally all failing (well ok, not literally, but they all have a C or lower) the unit they're working on. Now common sense would dictate that they maybe go over it a bit more, or explain it in a different way. Instead, they have a strict curriculum that literally plans out every single day of the year (they complain about being behind because of snow days). You already learned that? That's nice, now just sit down and shut up and listen. Do this busywork homework on something you already know. Kids don't want to learn. Teachers just want to assign work and make themselves feel like their subject is important. And parents just want their kids to do well on tests. No one gives a :xcensored if the kid actually knows it.\n \n But in terms of PE (I love how off-topic this can get, I'm getting off-topic of a topic that is totally off-topic from sex ed), I can agree with cutting it from the curriculum if kids are given more free time to get some exercise and have some fun outside of school. But I would like to say that I think I do much better on tests right after PE than I do on other ones. Most \"acedemics\" (I really don't like that word, it's so vague) stress developing the kid's brain. But how about the body? I'm not talking about just go out and play, I'm talking about learning about muscles and such, proper stretching, and getting exercise. Most kids don't know much about that.",

But don't fill the pitch with the lies and half-truths that current abstinence-only programs use. If this is to be sex education, then it should be education, not fearmongering.\n \n For as long as there have been teenagers, there has been teenage sex. Whether we want it to be true or not, we are not going to change this. What we can change is the treatment of sex as some sort of reprehensible, terrible act worthy only of shame. Not only do the abstinence-only programs teach (i.e. lie) and say that condoms aren't reliable, many teens are afraid of having their parents find what I'll refer to as \"sex paraphernalia.\" So when the urge is just too strong for a half-hearted pledge, the pledge is forgotten, the protection is ignored, and the unwanted results happen anyway.\n \n This is why the vast majority of studies show that abstinence-only sex ed doesn't work. Not only does it not reduce the number of sexually active teens, it increases the disuse of protection and therefore increases VD and pregnancy rates.\n \n So why do neocons keep pushing abstinence-only sex ed? Either they're so idiotic that they don't realize that it just increases VD and pregnancy without reducing sexual activity, or they actually don't care about these things and instead care more about something else.

   "Why wouldn't you thin I would take such a position? I am not sure we should bother teaching sex ed at all. Teach them about VD in health class and let them run. Kids are going to do what they are going to do. If parents don't want their kids whoring around, they can deal with it. Not the shcools problem.\n\n \n The moment we say \"its not my problem\" there is a huge problem with the kids in our society. Its BECAUSE no one actually gives a damn that our kids are suffering right now.\n \nI am all for moving schools back to the basics. Take a look at how our kids test against kids in other countries. We spend more per child than almost any nation n the planet, yet our high school seniors are being outscored by French 8th grader. I say cut sex ed, PE, sports, and just about any other worthless, non academic pursuit. Those are hobbies. \n\n Simply because you don't consider something non-academic, ie the arts, doesn't make them hobby. People are smart in all kinds of ways, not just history, math science. Also, taking these courses might make kids a little bit happier to go, thus making them more content to stay in school.\n \n We also need to teach kids sex ed. in schools. Maybe the way we were taught was ineffective in the past, but that can change if we want it to. ie. teach kids that masturbation is another solution. Seriously, boys don't necessarily want to know about where a woman's ovaries are at that point. They are just interested in the act and possible repercussions of their actions and if what theyre going through is normal. They have tons of questions, TONS! and everyone is afraid to answer them. I'm from Canada and we have a pretty good sex ed program (our best sex ed teacher was Dr.Sue Johannsen, who is now teaching to America).\n \n \n\n When our high school seniors are no longe dumber than every other countries high school seniors in the developed world, we can talk abotu puttinf fun back intot he schools. Until then, axe those programs to the bone.\n It's not because of those \"hobby\" programs that your kids are so dumb. Anyways, you should be less concerned about competing with the world and more about raising a healthy child.",

It is also very true that if a young woman respects her own body, then the guys who know her will respect her too.\n\n \n The only way for this to happen is to have NO sex. You can easily get an STD from marital sex.\n \n IMO, sex ed should be both. Abstinence should be taught as the best form of STD and pregnancy prevention, but it should also be taught that if you are going to have sex, do it safely. When I took health class, we were taught how to use birth control and where it was available, which I think was a really good idea. Unprotected sex is stupidity, pardon my bluntness. Birth control is free, easy, and effective. Its like riding a bike with no helmet. Riding a bike is not stupid, but doing it without a helmet is.\n \n My opinion on sex is that anyone who has been in a loving monogamous relationship for awhile and is over 15 years of age I see no problem. Sex is something that can be good or bad, and as long as middle schoolers aren't doing it I don't see how age is relevant. A 25 year old is no more likely to get STDs or pregnant than a 17 year old. As for birth control, when used properly you are more way more likely to be hit by a car than to get pregnant or an STD while using a condom. Thank to Planned Parenthood, they're free, and they take a short amount of time to put on.\n \n And I don't see the problem with premarital sex. If someone chooses to do that, then that's their choice. But it is no more right or just than doing it before marriage.",

And both of these teachings would be including abstinence in sex ed.\n\n \n A distinction which I certainly made. But look, once people are adults, it's their decision what they do with their sex lives. Not the decision or business of the government, their parents, or any dishonest, totalitarian, lacsivious bedroom-snooping fanatic like Archangel. \n \n Hopefully, by the time people are adults -- and thinking and feeling matured to a certain extent -- and lives are, so to speak, on the road to somewhere meaningful for people, as individuals, they are also well informed on the biology, interpersonal and health issues around sexual relationships, their reproductive rights and options, and the consequences of various decisions, including responsibilities of children.\n \n But beyond religious belief, marriage is a contractual relationship that we are not obliged to take on in a free society -- and certainly not obliged to take on in order to have sexual relationships. Hey, \"marriage\" isn't even an option for 10% of the population oriented towards same-gender relationships. Schools have absolutely no business teaching people's children that, as adults, they should be married in order to have sex. So, while they may have business encouraging students to be involved in their life pursuits, and waiting until they are adults to make this decision, this is quite different than just giving them some unthinking moral formula about some magical holy state called \"marriage\". Where -- bingo! Now you can sex -- even if you know nothing about it -- and everything's ok! This is a religious position, and if you are not religious -- which is your RIGHT in AMERICA -- it is even antithetical to adult interests in an egalitarian and democratic society.\n \n Indeed, for women for particular, they should know who they're involving themselves with. And know quite well. Historically, many women have gone into marriages only to be greatly disappointed. Their husbands found to be selfish, diminishing slobs, somewhat like the troll here, Archangel, who thinks of only of his own satisfaction. And takes delight in lashing out at others -- putting others down. \n \n But even today, it's difficult to undo marriage. And best to well know the individual you hope to spend your life with. Certainly in terms of sex, too. So, unless you have certain religious beliefs, IMO, there is no rational reason to wait until some government justice of the peace \"blesses\" you. Indeed, it is IRRATIONAL to do so. We make our own blessings in this short journey. Choose well, and choose as a free person -- both you and your partner -- which includes being informed and responsible about that choice.",

   "Just for the record, I do not endorse underage premarital sex. As I stated earlier on this board, as a general rule, I think it's best for people to wait until they're adults before making these kinds of decisions about a relationship (and even, as adults, they should be well informed on any number of things). Again, though, I do not think it's appropriate, for the government to be telling people that, as adults, they should be married before having sex. Nor do I think it's an even rationally defensible position in this day and age. Faith-based only, AFAICTell, if the posture is even deservable of ANY intellectual respect. But adults in a free society have to make these decisions for themselves. Hopefully in an informed way. And marriage, in and of itself, is certainly no guarantee that they have made the correct one. Indeed, may well (or, likely is) inadvisible and foolhardy, for adults, as a first. (For be appreciative, folks, for both your sons' and daughters' sakes, that this is the 21st century, not the 16th. Do not unquestioningly pass the archaic vestiges of ignorance along, for their sakes. They do not have to go, unknowingly, and as a religious sacrifice. This is not in their best interests.)\n \n But back to the other point (underage premarital sex -- which I think generally inadvisible for various developmental reasons). If anyone has made an excellent argument on behalf of some minors able to make this kind of relationship decision for themselves, I haven't heard a better one than that expressed by shooter.\n \n But usually what I see are that most teenagers who proceed as if ready, quite contrarily, not. Which is one of the reasons why so many are carrying HIV and don't even know.\n \n IME, the ones who can articulate intelligently on the subject, and in an informed way, are usually quite conservative in practice, though their politics, liberal. \n \n Information and thinking are key.\n \n As for the ones who speak volumes about \"abstinence-only\" education -- including the minors who say their parents are right -- well, look where it got the moralistic governor's daughter.\n \n Abstinence only education is hypocritical and ineffective. And goes hand in hand with promoting ignorance and disrespecting other people's privacy and right to make their own informed choices.\n \n I'll add that I would never support a non-family member adult's license to reference, uninvited, their imaginings of a teenager's personal practices any more than their license to reference, uninvited, the imagined practices of another adult they don't know. Teenagers are entitled to respect of their privacy and boundaries on this subject just as adults are.\n \n It's jaw dropping how disrespectfully adults treat teenagers, and including, on the subject of sex and pregnancy.\n \n It's also an absurd contradiction in logic to implicitly expect people to be sexually active before they can have legitimate opinions about sex.",

The religious right and the public schools.\n \n Because, no. one, parents are right to be concerned about the prevailing culture of permissiveness and the school's cop-out. \n \n But no. two, the school -- under the influence of the religious right -- has no business telling people that adults should be married, first. \"Abstinence only\" is just as much a cop out. And doesn't work, anyway.\n \n Both sides essentially see people as stupid and unable to grasp issues beyond simplistic black and white wrangling.

Unsurprisingly, Texas has one of the highest rates of teenage STDs and teenage pregnancy.\n\n \n Then it wasn't sexual education at all. The issue is that they just needed to have sexual education in their schools, period. I disagree when people portray abstinence as just a form of birth control; that's the wrong way to look at it that doesn't give it enough credence. Again, from what I see, mostly the only ones who seem to ever even use the phrase 'abstinence-only' are people who really don't like the concept of encouraging abstinence and want to pick a fight over it. I think it's often just a backhanded way to oppose the approach of abstinence period without having to sound like they're imposing. I've NEVER heard an \"abstinence-only\" opponent really advocate abstinence at all, and I've RARELY ever heard an \"abstinence-only\" PROponent claim contraceptives are evil or should never be used. The issue is really between two approaches: a.) don't have sex until you're married or b.) have sex and be safe, and in most cases BOTH camps would say use common sense and be safe if you mess up. it's not like most abstinence-advocates claim contraceptives are evil, or something. (Unless they're Catholic, I guess.) That's what annoys me about the debate--the issue really is never the \"ONLY\" part when it comes to 'abstinence-only', but that's what opponents like to portray it as.\n \n There was a time that liberals just didn't want abstinence even made a focus at all--the free love /sexual revolution thing. Many of them viewed ANY encouragement of restriction as being too much. Abstinence proponents have made a lot of progress in that even a lot of liberals will now at least acknowledge that avoiding promiscuity is a good thing. (Even if they do try to shift their fight to the so-called \"ONLY\" crowd, when it comes to abstinence.) So clearly religious people who prefer abstinence have helped moderate culture back toward a safer moral center. And even if the only reason some liberals now admit promiscuity is a bad thing is due to the spread of STDs and therefore they pretty much HAVE to admit it, either way, abstinence-focus proponents (like myself) are seeing progress and that's what matters.",

(Grown-ups ought to know this, too. Rules are the same for them.) Kids should also be encouraged to be abstinate until they are adults and have the maturity to handle sex and its consequences with responsibility. I do not like promoting the \"until marriage\" mantra in the classroom. Marriage does not make one automatically responsible nor does one ever have to marry. (I, for one, would just as soon throw myself off a bridge than marry again. Nothing against marriage - just not for me. But at nearly 40 years of age I can certainly handle sex in a responsible manner - and do!)\n \n In addition kids should know about birth control and the effectiveness level and risks associated with each kind.\n \n Kids should most definately be taught to respect themselves.\n \n The idea that sex-education promotes a desire to try sex is the most ludicrous thing I have heard in awhile. Sexual desire is natural and normal - and will be discovered even if nobody ever says a word to them about sex. Its like saying educating healthy eating habits will promote a desire to eat nothing but cookies. \n \n And you have got to get over your need for ridiculous stereotypes, Archie. I think you will find few parents who think their young kids ought to be getting it on or who don't want their kids to respect themselves. Before knocking us secularists - remember it was an ultra right-wing, Christian, supporter of abstinance-only sex ed in this last election who had a knocked up unmarried daughter.

And they don't need 'exciting' sex ed to titillate themselves... they wake up titillated every morning!\n\n \n There's a VERY easy way to stop pre-marital sex-- AND teenage obesity.\n \n \n Just tell girls the TRUTH: \n \n THIN VIRGINS MARRY RICH-- ALL OTHERS END UP SERVING THEM!\n If you show all girls a PROVEN GRAPH of average marital incomes correlating to their weight and virginity, then this would SHOW THEM THE MONEY-- and it really IS \"the world's oldest profession.\" Girls also have a competitive streak against each other, that make men's pale in comparison, even on the battlefield; they all want to OUT-MARRY each other, and will do ANYTHING to achieve that-- and to AVOID messing it up!\n \n Throw in \"educational achievement,\" and you'll take care of education as well (for boys as well as girls, since they'll have to earn MORE than the girls they want).\n \n Girls are HARD-WIRED to marry for money, and so if you show them the HARD, COLD REALITY regarding what makes a rich wife vs. a poor one, then you'll see them becoming athletic virtuoso-celibates in 2 shakes of Britney's bottom.\n \n However this will NEVER happen in public schools, which preach a socialist, politically-correct message (i.e. an outright bald-faced LIE) about life's values of consequence-free hedonism, sloth and debauchery-- and that \"money, laziness and loose sex don't matter in life.\"\n \n I think REALITY is the best response to this-- and so if we simply show such a graph based on REAL data, then the facts will speak for themselves... and ask them, \"Do you want to end up LIVING in a mansion-- or CLEANING one?\"\n Once this reality bitch-slaps them, girls of all ages will drop their Cinnabons and condoms, and jog 5 miles/day to the school library with their knees stapled together.\n \n Likewise, boys will FORGET sports and video-games, hit the books, and work toward to EARNING that money required to GET those thin virgins!\n \n \n \n CAPITALISM WINS AGAIN!!\n ",

Stupid, superficial men want to marry thin virgins - and since its what they want of course we gals will just step up to become your perfect little fantasy and the reward will be shopping money.\n \n Believe it or not women have various talents and dreams, many of which that have nothing to do with marriage and will even provide careers more bracing than that of a maid. I am happily single (I threw HIM out), make a good a living (not as a maid), travel a lot, have complete autonomy in my life and could, frankly, lose some weight. Nothing you describe above makes me want to change my circumstances on iota. Petty, Barbie playmate vs. capable, happy, self-determination - hmm didn't even have to think about that one. Maybe you have yet to find the nuts to manage a relationship with a real woman and therefore you only people your life with twits or maybe you just base us all on what you see on reality TV or Desperate Housewives...in any case, promise me you will never have daughters.",
