   "I don't think he'll get a chance to ban guns, but I gaurantee you that he will restrict them as tightly as congress allows. I gaurantee you that he will do whatever he can, wether that be banning handguns, banning so-called \"Assault- weapons\", using backdoor strategies to bankrupt the gun industry, etc.\n \n However, the above paragraph is off topic. Don't get me wrong, I pray that his economic stimulus package works. I'm not expecting it to work, but I hope it does. If you are an American citizen, you will be well aware that an outright ban on firearms would be political suicide... if you don't have the right advantages. \n \n Like I said, I'm not expecting this to happen, but if Obama improves the economy even for a second, America will be sucking his :xcensored. If he does this, he will have the power to do whatever he wants. He'll be able to ban all guns, legalize pedophilia (I'm talking 58-9, not 18-17), flip everybody off during every speech during his campaign, and still win the elections. \n \n However, if his term is as it's more likely to be, he'd be smart not to try it. Then again, he may not be that smart...",
