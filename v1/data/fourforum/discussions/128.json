   "For those of you not watching it or interested in debating it, I create this topic. All facts will be based on what Powell says.\n \n 1. Communications intercepts: An officer says they have evacuated everything and they have modified a truck frtom the al-Kindi company, one that has been known to assist the regime with weapons of mass destruction. Be assured that if he figures out who those men were that they'll no longer be with us. Remove the instruction nerve agents wherever it comes up in the wireless instructions, from another intercept. They knew we could monitor what they were saying sometimes, but we had them this time. \n \n 2. Documents: Documents are being hidden id cars and driven around the country. They also are being hidden in homes, hospitals, and mosques. 2000 pages of documents were found in an Iraqi nuclear scientist's home by UN inspectors. \n \n 3. Banned Materials: Satellite photos show banned materials and weapons being moved, and also facilities. These facilities had decontamination trucks parked in front of them and tents aroudn them. When inspectors came to the area the bunkers had been cleaned, tents down, vehciles moved. Before inspections resumed, in around 30 sites, large caravans of trucks were at most of the facilities. \n \n 4. Intercepting UN Communications: Iraq seems to always be waiting for inspectors. Why? They have tapped phones and electronic communications.\n \n 5. Scientists Cooperation: Anyone who cooperates with inspectors is considered to be commiting treason. Anyone who leaves the country for an interviev is considered a spy. In order to avoid interviews with some scientists, Iraq has issued fake death certificated and put them into hiding. A dozen experts have been placed under arrest at one of Saddam's guest houses. Scientists have also been told to stay home when inspectors will be at certain facilities. \n \n I had to eat lunch here... anyone who got details on biological/ chemical weapons should post it, and I also missed about half of the nuclear presentation...would rather not post on that either. Thanks :) \n \n 6. Missiles and UAVs: Saddam has been trying to develop ballistic missiles that fly over 1000 kilometers. They have also imported rocket engines that are illegal under their agreements with the UN, and that would be used on millies that would exceed the 150 kilometer missile range limit. Iraq has been working on many UAVs. Iraq wants small UAVs to use with their spray devices to disperse chemical or biological weapons. They have tested a UAV that can fly 500 kilometers. This test was omitted from the weapons declaration.\n \n \n 7. Terrorism: Iraq and terrorism go way back. Iraq has trained members of Palestinian terror groups. Iraq is hosting a terror group in their country now. The leader of the group oversaw operation of a poisons camp in Afghanistan. He has established another camp in Iraq. Iraqi agents have offered al Queda members safety in Iraq, many accepted. The terror group related to al Queda has an office in Baghdad where they operate their group freely. Two al Queda operatives were caught on the Iraq- Saudi Arabia border and arrested. Operatives have bragged about being safe in Iraq. Iraq claims they do not know about the leader of this terror group, but we know he is there. That netowrk remains in Baghdad and the leader is at large. This group has operatives in France, Germany, Russia, and the list goes on. Britain, Spain, and Italy has arrested over 100 persons in Europe who were ordered to test poisons and explosives in Europe. Lists of ingredients and guides how to make toxins were discovered in these people's possetion. These operatives are also known to operate in a terrorist region in Russia. Remember, Iraq has the operations bases for this group. bin Laden has also met with the two Iraqi officials and Saddam was more willing to assist al Queda after recent terrorist attacks because he was impressed. Iraqi operatives were sent to Afghanistan to train al Queda operatives in the 90s on how to forge documents. Hamas opened an office in Baghdad in 1999. THere are also extensive ties to other Islamic terror groups. al Queda had two associates trained in Iraq to help them attain chemical and biological weapons. \n \n 8. Human Rights Violations: Saddam used chemical weapons against the Kurds. 2000 villages were destroyed and there were many mass executions. Tens of thousands of people are missing as a result of the current regime. We all know about the torture and the rest of the killing.\n \n Iraq is not fully cooperating and is not complying with 1441. There are no more chances--he has had 16.",

I'm sure that some conservatives would disagree with me on this but we arent doing a good enough job of securing or boarders. The FBI isnt doing a good enough job. I understand why its hard for them to do their job. When your a free society like we are its hard to find terrorist because god forbid you sterotype someone. So you cant compare the U.S. having terrorist to a dictatorship having terrorists. Up until recently its hard to tag someone as a terrorist until they do something even if you know its a terrorist. In a dictorship if you dont want terrorist you just suppress everyones freedom like you do anyway. But instead you have deals with them. Thats what harboring terrorist is. I have to agree with you on the nuclear weapon situation. I dont believe the U.S. or any nation for that matter should have WMD's but i guess they use it as a deterrent. but its a tough issue.",

It took 2 years before public polls started shwoing what INTELLIGENT people knew form the start, that ties between saddam and terrorism were tenous at best. We knew for a fact (and still do) that the house of saud has MUCH, MUCH closer ties to anti american terrorism than Saddam.\n \n Iraq is certainly part of the war on terrorism now. we have provided the terrorists with a training camp better than anything they ever possibly could have dreamed of. The new generation of terrorists will not be disenfranchised young arabs, they will be battle hardened vetrans of the Iraq war. Additionall, we have turned Iraq from a powerful secular state into a fundamentalist state allied with Iran and Syria, who DO support terrorism. \n \n \nThey would have all been happy with a half *** attempt on Afghganistan and then bring them home. This generation of Americans have no concept of war and what it takes to win a war. You can ask any soldier who fought for North Vietnam. They never beat us on the battle field ;they beat us at home. No one supported the war or the troops then and thats why we lost.\n\n \n No, we lost in vietnam becuse we could not win. Sorry. I spent a LOT of time studying the vietnam war in the military. It is one of the prie examples we have to this day of how NOT to fight a war. It was not simply a matter of propoganda and publicity. We were not equipped to fight the ground war on the level that the enemy was willing to finght. We could certainly have beaten the North Vietnamese regular army, but we never would have beaten the VC. It was simply impossible. No regular army has ever won a guerilla war. Post vietnam, we started increasing the number of special ops troops trained in guerilla and counter guerilla tactics. We still don't have enough to wage a decent guerilla war, and certainly not in the ME (the primary problem the military has as far as strategy is always being a war behind....in vietnam, we were trying to re-fight WWII...in Iraq, we are trying to re-fight vietnam...it won't work).\n \n \nI dont care if protesters say they support the troops. The troops will perceive it as they do not support this war therefore they do not support me.\n\n \n Words of an armchair general with no idea what they are talking about. that is rediculous vietnam era propoganda. As the war became increasingly unpopular, the strategy became to connect the war directly to the troops, the idea being that americans would not turn against their own. It worked for a couple of years, then the war in vietnam became unpopular enoguh to overcome the patriotic hype, and since the troops ahd already been calssed in with the war, people took out their frustration on the troops (thus stories about soldiers being spit on, etc....).\n \n That is why the military has adopted apolicy of ensuring that no administration EVER again uses the troops as a shield for anti war oppposition. the bush administration has tried more than once, and the military has cut it off nicely (such as tommy franks saying \"Anybody who says you cannot support the troops without supporting the war is a damn fool and a liar\" in response to Rumsfelds \"In order to support the troops, you MUST support the war\").\n \n Nobody who supports our troops would make an idiotic, thoughtless statement like you have above. \n \n \nThis is the me generation so i guess the World World 2 generation full of Americans who weren't spoiled and knew that war was tough is long gone. They also didnt gripe about how low the economy was and then go home and sit in front of their plasma TV. emoticon_cry\n\n \n Americans know war is tough. We also know that waging unnecessary war is a bad thing, and that wars that increase the numbers of our opposition and build stronger enemies are a bad idea.",

I will go through these quickly since you might actually believe this ignorant drivel.\n \n \n1) He gave military secrets to the Chinese\n\n \n No, he didn't. During the clinton administration, nuclear secrets were stolen form Los alamos and passed onto the chinese. You can hardly blame Clinton for this, since the administrative branch does NOT have oversight over Los Alamos. The DOE has autonomy in its nuclear program. Thsi is a security leftover from the days of WWII. \n \n \n2) He payed billions to North Korea to stop making WMDs\n\n \n True\n \n \n3) He refused and offer from the Sudan to arrest Bin Laden.\n\n \n No, he didn't. We did not have enough to take him, IF the offer had ever actually been made. This is the US. You actually have to have evidence and such to take somebody and hold them for a crime. At the time, we did not have the evidence to do so (truth be told, we still don't, since hearsay is not evidence in a criminal case).\n \n \n4) He treated the World Trade Center bombing as a individual crime.\n 5) He treated the USS Cole as a individual crime. \n 6) He ignored the over all picture of terrorism.\n\n \n This is as retarded as anything I have ever seen. Clinton treated the WTC bombing and USS cole bombing as individual crimes? I was on the ground with a rifle in afghanistan when we did our retalitory strike for those events. Ignoring terrorism? then wy the hell was I on the gorund with a rifle killing AQ members and painting camps for bombing missions? We sure wasted a lot of cruise missiles if we were choosing to ignore those things.\n \n \nOhh and by the way nobody griped about Kosovo. Were they a threat to U.S. security.\n\n \n No, kosovo was an example of us fulfilling our treaty responsibilities. That was NOT an illegal war.",

   "I would have to disagree with you on that. The war in Iraq is part of the war on terror. When George Bush stated the reasons behind going into Iraq he not only said WMDs he said to rid the country of terrorists.\n\n neither of these claims were true. there were neither wmds nor al qaeda terrorists in iraq. not only that, but places like egypt, saudi arabia, yemen, omar, jordan, etc, where we know without a doubt are harboring al qaeda operatives, have been totally ignored\n \n \nSaddam was harboring terrorist believe it or not just like most middle eastern countries. So to say that Iraq is not part of the larger war on terror is crazy. \n\n i suppose so. would you say that iraq is 50% of the terrorist problem? 25%? 10%? 5%? why are we allocating 100% of our anti-terrorism efforts to a country that is not even the 10th biggest supporter of organized terrorism?\n \n \nIt wouldnt matter what country we were in whether it was Iraq or not. The American public would still not support it 4 years after 9/11 because we have short attention spans. They would have all been happy with a half *** attempt on Afghganistan and then bring them home. This generation of Americans have no concept of war and what it takes to win a war. You can ask any soldier who fought for North Vietnam. They never beat us on the battle field ;they beat us at home. No one supported the war or the troops then and thats why we lost. I dont care if protesters say they support the troops. The troops will perceive it as they do not support this war therefore they do not support me. This is the me generation so i guess the World World 2 generation full of Americans who weren't spoiled and knew that war was tough is long gone. They also didnt gripe about how low the economy was and then go home and sit in front of their plasma TV. emoticon_cry\n\n its a stupid war, thats why its not being supported. we're not fighting terror, we're invading iraq. bin laden and most of the al qaeda heads are still at large, and dozens of countries are still allowing them to grow, recruit and get funds.\n \n please explain how setting up an assimilated democracy in iraq will reduce fundamentalist terrorism in the middle east",

   "They are the two worst terrorist states out there. Tell me a solution to the problem in the middle east and any other problems in the world that doesn't involve the use of military power.\n\n first of all, i think we might be differing on exactly what the \"problem in the middle east\" is. to me, the problem is simply the facilitaion of countries to allow large organized terrorist groups to flourish. when the 9/11 attack occured, we had every right to make that our problem.\n \n the way to deal with it is by going to the countries where these organized terrorist groups are allowed to flourish, and strike preemptively against them. an organized terrorist group is wrong for any country, and no country should oppose our entry for the purpose of dismantling the terrorists organizations there. we shouldnt have to ask permission to enter any country and deal with the dismantling and total solvency of any such groups. and if faced with a problematic country, 2 things could be done. either move to another cooperative country, and show them that we are professionals and effective in our mission, or we could declare war on that country and force entry. of course, the 1st option is by far more effective\n \n as to why a political system would be unwilling to have their resident terrorists eliminated, there could be many reasons. a terrorist group could be seen as a legitamate form of miliatry defense for a government. or it could be their way of getting other countries to see things their way. regardless of the reason, they can be ironed out. incentives for trade or security could be offered for compliance. \n \n because the operation would be on a country by country basis, the problem of expense and support would be minimized, since most of the work would be done by specialized teams and sensitized intelligence. after 2-3 countries have been effectively purged of terror, its very likely that surrounding countries that are next on the list will make every effort to assist, making our workload gradually less and less. of course, the policies that allow the sustenance of these terrorist groups would have to be thoroughly analyzed and fixed once our cleaning operations are done. for each subsequent country, we should get to that stage faster than before\n \n this year it has been 4 years since the 9/11 attacks. bin laden, and the saudis, jordanians and egyptians that helped him plan and execute those attacks have only aged 4 years, but in every other regard are still as happy, healthy, and able to attack us as they ever were. terrorism does no good for any country, and if we are taking up the matle of warring against terrorism, then lets do that, instead of lying to gullible americans and wasting money and lives",
