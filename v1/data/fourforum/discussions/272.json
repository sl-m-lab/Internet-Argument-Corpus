   "While I was starting a thread in creation vs. evolution, I went to reach for my bible, specifically to the book of Genesis. Then I decided I would rather talk about a different type of Genesis. There was a Simulation Tool developed out of Caltech that has been used to model Nueral Networks. Its name is Genesis. The purpose of this project is to use the principle of  multiple realizability, \"the contention that a given mental kind (property, state, event) is realized by distinct physical kinds\", can be employed using computers to accurately model the nueral and biological mechanisms of the brain. This is being done in order to obtain greater understanding into the workings of the \"mind\".\n \n Of course, the question that arises from such research gets back to the old idea of the  Turing Test. This idea was formulated by Alan Turing in the 1950's when he postulated that one day machines could be programmed with intelligence rivaling man's. The Turing Test was based on the ability of the computer to simulate human conversation. Turing thought, if you could have a person sit and talk to a computer and not be able to tell they were not talking to a machine, the computer could be said to have acquired intelligence.\n \n It is easy to see how this kind of indicator would fail to gauge the intelligence of the machine. First, Turing stated that the machine only had to simulate conversation, not actually engage in it. Second, the machine's intelligence is limited by the ingenuity of the programmer, as it is a dependent system. Finally, it is fully possible to generating outputs of characters or sounds without knowledge of what those patterns represent. Even though Turing's Test remains flawed, he was the originator the Artificial Intelligence idea, and attempted to formulate criteria to determine when this had been achieved.\n \n In light of advances in biological and quatum computing, nanotechnology, fuzzy logic, and nueral networks, the prospect of AI is as real as it has ever been. Therefore, it will remain one of the hotly debated areas in the science and philosophical arenas. This is why I have dedicated a thread to its discussion. Your thoughts, comments, and reservations about this new and exciting field are welcome. It is interesting to note that the term Genesis is often used in science and science fiction. Perhaps scientists are open to the idea of a creator, especially as they are increasingly finding themselves in that position.",

   "There are really two sides to this debate. Ray Kurzweil is at one extreme end, believing that it is only a matter of time before man and machine merge, and that we should move to facilitate this next step in human evolution. While, Ted Kasinski and others have a reasonable fear of what these developments would mean for all mankind. Those on his side of the debate see the potential abuses and dangers as too risky, and want to curtail the exponential growth of our processing capabilities. Since the 1960's computer memory, processing speed and advances in circuitry have allowed for us to double our processing capability every 18 months. This is given by Moore's Law, and is the reason some have fear of what these sharp increases in computing power might bring. The movie \"The Matrix\" demonstrated many of the philosophical issues surrounding this debate, using the concept of virtual reality. That movie is the first to touch on a variety of key points, and is the worst case scenario feared by those who oppose Kurzweil's view. This issue has been with us since the advent of computers. In fact, the Twilight Zone was one of the first to popularize the concept of \"evil\" computers.\n \n I guess the question is this. Should we give computers the ability to think? Would intelligent computers find themselves in direct competition with humans for the limited resources and space on this planet? If so, should we include a fail safe device to prevent the kind of scorched earth scenario James Cameron used as the setting for his \"Terminator\" movies? By and large, there is much to debate in this area of interest. All you need is the imagination necessary to invision what the future might hold for our species. This is one of my favorite topics to discuss, because unlike the creation vs. evolution debate, it actually has implications in the here and now.",

However, there are whole industrial plants that operate using robotics, instead of human labor. Does each component have a simple task? Sure. However, the question had to do more with modeling complex brain functions using nueral networks. If advances in this area of research happen to develop a system that is able to think independent of programming language, then we have achieved an intelligent machine. Suppose, in the interest of profit, you used one of these artificial brains as the main-frame for the operating of one of these manufacturing plants that uses robots exclusively. If you were intelligent and realized that you lacked a body or the ability to move freely, what would you do?",

   "thoroughly understand your sources before referencing it.\n \n <I<\n Do any of you see how the following article may pertain to this conversation? The Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California, Berkeley has been able to attach electrodes to a cat's brain and output the cat's vision on a computer monitor.\n </I<\n \n Do you know the details of this work? Do you know what they did exactly? Do you know what the quality of the output image is? This link that you referenced mentions something called \"linear decoding technique\". Do you know what that is? Before looking into the implications of this, maybe you should look into understanding it...\n \n Well, let me give you an extremely brief overview. There is a big portion of every brain of animals with visual sensory mechanisms that is devoted to processing visual stimuli. Vision is generally assumed to be most the complicated modality because its dimension and resolution are higher than any other modality. This means that understanding (human or biologically derived) visual processing mechanisms up to the level of visual consciousness is probably the hardest problem to tackle in neuroscience. It also means that solving it will give tools and patterns to solve other processing mechanisms.\n Obviously, the exact details of the visual pathway from stimulus to consciousness is very much unknown. From anatomical and physiological and related works, the general outline of the pathway has been that: information gets sampled at the retina, trasferred to the thalamus (something called the lateral geniculate nucleus), and then to cortial processing areas (in the posterior and temporal regions of the brain). \n \n In a computational framework, the first stage in this processing (generally referred to as early vision) does extraction and coding of information required for higher processing. Consciousness DOES NOT appear in early vision. Physiologically and anatomically speaking, I think people have more or less accepted that processing units up to the thalamus do not contribute directly to consciousness. There are still debates as to which visual cortical areas may be directly involved in consciousness.\n \n As for the details of the work, the researchers recorded spiking activities for a lot of cells in the thalamus, bin the spikes to get a bunch of signals over time, and this signal over time is what they used. In the first part of the experiment, they present a bunch of stimuli, record activities, ASSUME all processing up to the thalamus can be represented by a linear system, and calculate the impulse response of the linear system (almost like a calibration process). In the second part of the experiment, they present a bunch of stimuli, record activities, and use the inverted impulse response to recover the stimuli. Exact details of information coding up to the thalamus is still not clear, so if you have seen the original papers, you'll see that it's really crappy work. Anyone can use least square to find the closest linear impulse response function to a system.\n \n This is nothing more than a hacker hacking the camera he/she bought at best buy (or found in the dumpster).\n \n <I<\n In short, it appears that we are getting to the point where we can see through the eyes of other biological entities. I have heard about other research of this sort being done with flies. What implications does this have in the area being discussed in this forum?\n </I<\n \n The implication in this work is no more than any other work in neurophysiology :) Robots won't be a threat unless they have \"consciousness\" (whatever that may mean) or can somehow possess some sort of qualia (whatever that may mean). The work at UCB looked at decoding an autonomous video coding system (not even a good decoding scheme at it). Seeing through the eyes of something is different from seeing with the eyes of something. There is no indication at all that we are anywhere closer to seeing through the eye of something in that work. Yeah, so we can use the cat eyes as cameras.... ok, so maybe the luminance gain control in the retina is great... so what? where is the core of seeing? how does it work? no one knows.\n \n <I<\n Imagine using signal electronics and nanotechnology to relay the sensory information of a variety of animals back to a computer mainframe for analysis. What if the military were to use a swarm of flies behind enemy lines? This, in conjuction with overhead satelite imaging, would get our forces as close as possible to perfect information with respect to enemy positions, ammunition storage, and maybe even battle plans.\n </I<\n \n This is not really AI anymore, but ok.\n \n <I<\n This sort of research is at the cutting edge of technology. The possibilities are endless, but the dangers for misuse are great. What kind of possible abuses could such technology bring? Again the possibilities are endless.\n </I<\n \n Deal with it as it comes....the fact is, we are far from creating something with consciousness. Maybe it's possible, maybe it's not, but we are far from knowing the answer.\n \n Btw, the reason why not many people reply to this thread is because you didn't raise a specific question. I am sure that I can write multiple books on the general topic you mentioned. I don't think that anyone wants to write a book in a for-fun-when-you're-bored not so serious debate forum.",

   "Hey cool post. Really old but covers a good topic.\n \n Anyways in response to AI computers taking over the world, I really don't see this as too likely. The main purpose of AI computers will be to serve humans. No one is going to want to make a computer that isn't 100% loyal to them. Military purposes would be a key purpose for making AI machines to be used in taking over something. Any machine made to do this will be kept under strict control and wouldn't be allowed to think for itself anyways. How about for business us? Well who wants an AI machine that will not show up for work or quit just because it felt like it? There is no way to profit from a machine that isn't 100% loyal. How about a robot that will be your friend? OK, I can see this as a practical application especially for butler robots or something like that. Who wants their friend and/or family employee to suddenly turn on them and leave them or even kill them? What would happen to the manufacturer if either happened? They would be sued for psychological stress or for allowing their machine to murder people.\n \n In short, Bill Gates wouldn't have been too successful selling Windows OS is it just suddenly began to hate you one day and deleted all your files. hmmmm, bad example. hehe. I think you see my point though. In an economic driven world, AI machines will be in demand but not if they don't do the task they are made to do. No company that sells AI machines that are allowed to think for themselves will be as successful as those which do as they are told or as they are supposed to do and therefore they won't get made in the first place.\n \n The fun stuff will be when humans begin getting genetic and robotic alterations. Think of a human with a brain/computer/hybrid that can hold an infinite amount of data, process it 1000x as fast as a normal human, and will live to be a million years old and can live on almost no food or sleep. Now that is virtually the AI machines your talking about only they really are human and the future for this type of application may be real especially for colonizing other planets.",
