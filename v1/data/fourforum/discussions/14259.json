As an Englishman I still get a little confused how 4 countries add up to equal 1 country but it does (I wish we could rename them states).\n \n Anyway I am sure it will help to ease the sting to your acute sense of fairness to realise that it does in fact act as a disadvantage to the national team. The smaller nations have produced some incredible players i.e. Best, Giggs, and 1970's Scotland. A British team my have had great success.\n\n \n I agree, when Yugoslavia split, it affected all sports, not only football. So it is a blessing and a curse also.",

   "emoticon_xhohoPIM Verbeek and his Socceroos have started their World Cup adventure, flying out of Melbourne for South Africa today. \n The 28-man squad gathered at the Qantas maintenance hangar at Melbourne Airport for the official ceremony before boarding its charter flight to Johannesburg.\n \n After speeches by key officials, the players were presented with boarding passes and a Socceroos scarf as they climbed the steps to the aircraft and South Africa.\n \n Coach Pim Verbeek, who will be leaving the Socceroos job once the team bows out of the World Cup, promised his team would be determined in its efforts against Germany, Ghana and Serbia.\n \n ''It's been a long journey to qualify, but here we are,'' Verbeek said. ''It is the football and sporting event in the world and we are proud to be there.\n \n ''The boys are ready and very excited and we're going to make it a fantastic tournament. We will do Australia proud.''\n \n Goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer says the Socceroos are on a mission to prove the doubters wrong. \n \n Having passed the group stage in Germany in 2006 in their first appearance since 1974, before being eliminated by eventual champions Italy in the second round, the pressure is on the Socceroos to at least equal that effort in South Africa. \n \n But 37-year-old Schwarzer said rather than feeling weight of expectations, the squad felt there were many critics who gave them scant hope of emerging from their tough group - also comprising Germany, Ghana and Serbia - this time. \n \n Victorian Premier John Brumby offered his best wishes and support and said: ''This is a great team capable of exceptional things. The people of Victoria and Australia are 100 per cent behind you.''\n \n The Socceroos play two warm-up games against Denmark and the United States before opening their tournament against Germany in Durban on June 14.",
