   "\"One could add that totalitarian regimes seem to have an intuitive awareness that it becomes hard for people to change after a certain age, which is why so much effort is made to indoctrinate the young from an early age. For instance, North Korea, the most thoroughgoing totalitarian regime in existence, places children in school from ages two and half to four years; they spend every hour in the cult of adoration for dictator Kim Jong Il and his father, Kim Sun Il.... This continues all the way through school.\"\n (from The Brain That Changes Itself, page 305)\n \n For the same reason the Eddie Eagle program exists. The NRA touts this \"educational\" program under a facade of promoting child safety, but research by public health experts indicates the program is ineffective. Why spend so much money on an ineffective program unless you have a hidden agenda?\n The NRA, like North Korea, realizes that it is much easier to influence and brainwash people while they are young. They know that once a child is indoctrinated in pro-gun ideology it will be much harder for the child to change their point view as they grow older. Thus, the gun industry will have more customers and the NRA will have more check writing members. The gun industry contributes hundreds of thousands of dollars to the NRA through the NRA Foundation. Such money is used to fund the Eddie Eagle program.",

   "What is The Eddie Eagle GunSafe\u00ae Program?\n \n Eddie Eagle The Eddie Eagle GunSafe\u00ae Program teaches children in pre-K through third grade four important steps to take if they find a gun. These steps are presented by the program's mascot, Eddie Eagle\u00ae, in an easy-to-remember format consisting of the following simple rules:\n \n If you see a gun:\n \n STOP!\n Don't Touch.\n Leave the Area.\n Tell an Adult.\n \n Begun in 1988, The Eddie Eagle GunSafe\u00ae Program has reached more than 21 million children -- in all 50 states. This program was developed through the combined efforts of such qualified professionals as clinical psychologists, reading specialists, teachers, curriculum specialists, urban housing safety officials, and law enforcement personnel.\n \n Anyone may teach The Eddie Eagle GunSafe\u00ae Program, and NRA membership is not required. The program may be readily incorporated into existing school curriculum, taught in a one- to five-day format, and used to reach both levels or simply one or two grades. Materials available through this program are: student workbooks, 7-minute animated video (available on DVD or VHS), instructor guides, brochures, and student reward stickers. Program materials are also available in Spanish.\n \n The NRA is committed to helping keep America's young children safe. In efforts to do so, we offer our program at a nominal fee. Schools, law enforcement agencies, hospitals, daycare centers, and libraries may be eligible to receive grant funding to defray program costs. Grant funding is available in many states to these groups to cover the cost of all program curriculum materials.\n \n The purpose of the Eddie Eagle Program isn't to teach whether guns are good or bad, but rather to promote the protection and safety of children. The program makes no value judgments about firearms, and no firearms are ever used in the program. Like swimming pools, electrical outlets, matchbooks and household poison, they're treated simply as a fact of everyday life. With firearms found in about half of all American households, it's a stance that makes sense.\n \n Eddie Eagle is never shown touching a firearm, and he does not promote firearm ownership or use. The program prohibits the use of Eddie Eagle mascots anywhere that guns are present. The Eddie Eagle Program has no agenda other than accident prevention -- ensuring that children stay safe should they encounter a gun. The program never mentions the NRA. Nor does it encourage children to buy guns or to become NRA members. The NRA does not receive any appropriations from Congress, nor is it a trade organization. It is not affiliated with any firearm or ammunition manufacturers or with any businesses that deal in guns and ammunition. \n \n \n I think you are confused,eddy eagle is promoting gun safety to children.\n These ###### in the DPRK are indoctrinating children into a way of life such as calling some pedophile DEAR LEADER when he has anything but their best interest in mind,not that their DEAR LEADER is going after a 5 year old however he does like his 12 year olds if I understand.http://www.4forums.com/political/images/smilies/xkill.gif\n emoticon_xkill",

They just can't stand the fact that the NRA might get a little respect for doing our country a service, although that is not why they do it. \n \n Demonize the NRA at any cost! emoticon_wow\n \n Teaching children gun safety is an effective way to cut down on accidents. This story is heavily edited, but despite it's success the writer seem to have nothing but disdain the founders of the program. \n \n Link    Experiment Tests Children's Knowledge of Gun Safety  \n ......

But not one of them touches the gun. \n \n After watching the video of their children's reactions, the parents are relieved. .......Even if you don't own a gun, teach your children to steer clear of guns at friends' homes, or wherever they come across them. \n \n \n The above program is not named however, it is Stop, Don't touch, Leave the Area, and tell an Adult. Or, NRA's Eddie the Eagle. Since this happened in Columbus Ohio, they probably did not want the NRA to get credit for anything. Very Sad!\n \n Here in Cleveland, one of our local News stations tested all of the Child safety programs like Eddie the Eagle about 6 or 7 years ago and only the NRA's Eddie the Eagle produced the same 100% results like the experiment above. \n \n Here is something explaining Eddie the Eagle. Link   Today's Gun Accident Rates Lowest On Record \n And what a success the program has been. Thanks to NRA safety training, fewer children are involved in fatal firearm accidents today than did 90 years ago, and America's accidental firearm fatality rates have fallen steadily for decades. But now, with the help of Eddie Eagle, that safety record is improving faster than ever before. Studies from the National Center for Health Statistics indicate a 56% drop in fatal firearm accidents among children since 1988, the year that Eddie Eagle began. \n\n  Awards \n The National Sheriffs' Association formally endorsed the Eddie Eagle GunSafe\u00ae Program. (March 2002)\n \n A study published in the Journal of Emergency Nursing Online named Eddie Eagle the best of more than 80 gun safety programs evaluated. (October 2001) \n \n The American Legion passed a resolution encouraging its Posts and Departments to introduce Eddie Eagle to elementary schools and law enforcement agencies in their communities. (May 1995) \n \n The American Legion Child Welfare Foundation awarded a $25,000 grant to The Eddie Eagle Program. (October 1995) \n \n The Youth Activities Division of the National Safety Council awarded its silver Award of Merit to The Eddie Eagle Program for its efforts to \"promote safety and health, save lives, lessen injury and reduce economic loss.\" (October 1996) \n \n National Safety Council presented its Citation for Outstanding Community Service Award to program creator and NRA President Marion P. Hammer. (October 1993) \n \n The National School Public Relations Association presented its Golden Achievement Award to the program. (April 1994)\n \n Link  2000 Annual Meeting Transcripts  \nWithin the past five years the NRA Members have donated 20 MILLION dollars to teach gun safety to 13 million children through the Eddie the Eagle gun Safety program. \n \n \n The NRA membership says: It is our gift from we grateful Law-abiding citizens, to our fellow citizens of this Great Nation.",

   "Time to poke fun at some anti-gun \"doublespeak.\"\n \n I remember when \"Eddie Eagle\" was created and introduced by the NRA. I believe it was Josh Sugarman of the anti-gun ownership Violence Policy Center who first called \"Eddie Eagle\" nothing more than \"Joe Camel with feathers.\" But there is nothing about \"Eddie Eagle\" which promotes gun ownership or possession. It is targeted specifically to child gun safety only. I invite anyone to demonstrate otherwise. This is the program in a nutshell from the NRA website (http://www.nrahq.org/safety/eddie/): \n \n \"The Eddie Eagle GunSafe\u00ae Program teaches children in pre-K through third grade four important steps to take if they find a gun. These steps are presented by the program's mascot, Eddie Eagle\u00ae, in an easy-to-remember format consisting of the following simple rules:\n \n If you see a gun: STOP! Don't Touch. Leave the Area. Tell an Adult. [bold emphasis in original]\n \n (Now remember these rules. You will see them again below....)\n \n I'm sorry, Galileo, but I just don't see how this program-oriented only on gun safety and which is completely neutral on gun ownership-has any resemblance to the North Korean mandatory school indoctrination program. \n \n Oh, I am aware that anti-gun groups have criticized child gun safety education in general as \"ineffective.\" In fact, the BC at one time gave up entirely on child gun safety education-citing this as its reason for doing so (http://www.wmsa.net/news/WashingtonPost/wp-020719_gun_safety.htm): \n \n \"Michael D. Barnes, president of the Brady Center and the Brady Campaign (formerly Handgun Control), said the gun control advocacy group abandoned its child education program recently because of research showing it had no positive effect. He said the group is now directing education efforts at parents.\" (July 19, 2002) \n \n I am also aware that the \"Million Mom March\" arm of the Brady Campaign continues to level the specific \"ineffective\" criticism at \"Eddie Eagle\" (Million Mom March: Awards) :\n \n A long sit in the Time Out Chair for the NRA Foundation's Eddie Eagle Program for 1. Touting education as gun safety when studies have shown that gun safety training does NOT deter children and youth from picking up and playing with guns.... [bold emphasis added by me] \n \n And you can still find on the \"Brady Blog\" portion of the Brady Campaign website the following comment about the effectiveness of the simple \"Eddie Eagle\" message Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence\n \n Showing children an NRA Eddie Eagle video - telling them to \"stop, don't touch, leave the area, and tell an adult\" when they see a gun - and then trying to reinforce that with some classroom instruction, doesn't seem to work at keeping children safe. [bold emphasis added by me]\n \n (Told you we would see the language again. But we are not through with it yet...). \n \n On second thought, maybe I have underestimated the \"cult of personality\" allure of the \"Eddie Eagle\" program after all, because I have found that the Brady Campaign has indeed come back to drink the sweet Kool-Aid with its \"Stop2\" child gun safety program. Just go to their website to see for yourself (http://www.bradycenter.org/stop2/): \n \n If you go there, as I did, you will discover that the Brady Campaign has-as part of its child gun safety program-a new web based interactive children's video game which you can jump to and play from the above site. It's called: \"A Day in the Neighborhood: A Gun Violence Prevention Game.\" When you launch the game you will see it explained this way:\n \n \"A Day in the Neighborhood\" is a virtual adventure game. The game will take you through real life situations involving firearms where you must make tough, and possibly life altering choices. Like real life, this game is full of choices. You will learn that the best decisions to make when a gun is in your environment is first, not to touch it; secondly, get out of the area where the gun is; and thirdly, tell an adult/authority about the gun. These skills will help you to make smart, wise, and safe choices both in the game and in real life. [bold emphasis added by me to show how it teaches exactly the same things in exactly the same order \"Eddie Eagle\" teaches]\n \n This leads me to pose a few questions:\n \n 1. If the gun control movement in general-and the BC in particular-believes and tells us that \"Eddie Eagle\" does not work, then why did the Brady Campaign recently adopt what it teaches almost word for word?\n \n 2. How does a prominent anti-gun umbrella organization still post on one web site that when \"Eddie Eagle\" is concerned \"studies have shown that gun safety training does NOT deter children and youth from picking up and playing with guns\"; and claim on another webpage that \"\"stop, don't touch, leave the area, and tell an adult\" \"doesn't seem to work at keeping children safe\"; while at the same time on another site maintain that its new program which teaches \"first, not to touch it; secondly, get out of the area where the gun is; and thirdly, tell an adult/authority about the gun\"\"will help you to make smart, wise, and safe choices both in the game and in real life\" and NOT get rightfully accused of engaging in Orwellian \"doublespeak\"? \n \n 3. If Josh Sugarman claims (as he does still on the VPC web site) that \"Eddie Eagle\" is nothing more than \"Joe Camel with feathers,\" then should he add a web page saying \"A Day in the Neighborhood\" is nothing more than \"Sara Brady in a blaze orange skirt?\"\n \n 4. Does this mean \"Eddie Eagle\" has to stand up and give Sara Brady his MMM \"time out chair\"?\n \n 5. Did the BC really create and publish that \"A Day in the Neighborhood\" child video game, or is this the work of the nefarious agents of Goldstein?\n \n ---\n \n On the sixth day of Hate Week. . .it had been announced that Oceana was not after all at war with Eurasia. Oceana was at war with Eastasia. Eurasia was an ally. There was, of course, no admission that any change had taken place. Merely it became known, with extreme suddenness, and everywhere at once, that Eastasia and not Eurasia was the enemy. Winston was taking part in a demonstration in one of the central London squares at the moment when it happened. It was night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit. The square was packed with several thousand people, including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the Spies. On a scarlet-draped platform an orator of the Inner Party, a small lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large, bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled, was haranguing the crowd. A little Rumpelstiltskin figure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the microphone with one hand while the other, enormous at the end of a bony arm, clawed the air menacingly above his head. His voice, made metallic by the amplifiers, boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres, deportations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing of civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken treaties. It was almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then maddened. At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beastlike roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren. The speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger hurried onto the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the speaker's hand. He unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voice or manner, or in the content of what he was saying, but suddenly the names were different. Without words said, a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd. Oceana was at war with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremendous commotion. The banners and posters with which the square was decorated were all wrong! Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them. It was sabotage! The agents of Goldstein had been at work! There was a riotous interlude while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to shreds and trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prodigies of activity clambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from the chimneys. But within two or three minutes it was all over. The orator, still gripping the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward, his free hand clawing the air, had gone straight on with his speech. One minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd. The Hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had been changed. The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in mid-sentence, not only without pause, but without even breaking the syntax.

All you do is ramble on and on and on about ignorance like it's undeniable gospel.\n \n You say that you're going to wait until after something happens before you'll step up to do anything, and even then you'd only address the parents and not your own children. If you cared about the lives of your own children then you'd be teaching them regularly and frequently about how dangerous guns are, that they're not toys meant to be played with, and that they're not to touch them if they find them. Instead of this you seem to be willing to let them be ignorant and know nothing, and risk shooting and killing themselves.\n \n Safe storage laws are no good when gang members dump their crime guns in the parks where your kids play, what's your answer going to be when a kid finds one and shoots themselves because they didn't know any better?\n \n Just as a safety selector switch on a firearm is no excuse to be stupid while armed, the mandatory storage laws of a handful of states is no excuse to not teach your kids how to be safe and not get hurt. There's absolutely no excuse for having the mentality of \"My kids don't need to learn not to touch a gun, only criminals don't keep their guns locked up so they have no need to worry about the possibility.\"\n \n #### happens, real life is very ugly. And if you aren't prepared in advance for what comes your way you're gonna be ground into dust by the real world, and that's the truth.\n \n Your words carry such a callous and uncaring tone I'm seriously wondering whether you love your children at all, or if you just see them as being nothing more than leverage points to be used for political gains at some later point in time. If you care about them then why don't you teach them how to be safe, rather than saying you'll go after parents later on?\n \n Do you also not let them watch TV so they won't know about crime and violence and all the bad things going on in the world? Are you trying to keep them in a sanitized bubble where nothing bad happens, and fairness and happy endings are the rule of the land?\n \n Your foolish trust in mandatory standards and mechanical devices are simply unacceptable reasons for not being a parent and carrying out your assigned duties. Just as the well being of your children is not the responsibility of gun owners, how we exercise our rights is not your responsibility either.",

Thus, the gun industry will have more customers and the NRA will have more check writing members. The gun industry contributes hundreds of thousands of dollars to the NRA through the NRA Foundation. Such money is used to fund the Eddie Eagle program.\n\n \n I wish my kids were young enough to sign up! \n \n From The Sunday Times\n October 15, 2006\n We starved, he called it paradise\n Growing up in North Korea, Hyok Kang was surrounded by desperate people who ate grass and bark before they died. Yet pervasive propaganda made them feel lucky to be there\n The first time I ate chocolate was when I was five years old. My grandfather had relatives in Japan who were given exceptional permission to visit us. They came like extraterrestrials with their arms full of presents and food. I remember waving tins of condensed milk and chocolate bars under my friends' noses. I was a horrid little boy. It was 1990 and I didn't yet know what famine was. I wouldn't taste chocolate again until we escaped to China when I was 13.\n \n In 1994, shortly before the death of Kim Il-sung, the Great Leader, the state food distribution system began to break down. Eventually, there was no more rice, no more potatoes. We moved on to vile food substitutes. Weeds, of whatever kind, were boiled up and swallowed in the form of soup. We picked these inedible leaves on the edges of the fields or the banks of the river. The soup was so bitter that we could barely keep it down.\n \n Our neighbours collected grass and tree bark - usually pine, or various shrubs. They grated the bark and boiled it up before eating it. And much good it did them: their faces swelled from day to day until they finally perished.\n \n Not only food was scarce. Our teachers gave each of us collection quotas: maize leaves (for paper mills), copper and other metals - and, during the winter, dung for fertiliser. We had to take six whole carts of faecal matter to the school, and not any old excrement: it had to be human. As it was frozen - the temperature fell to -20C or -30C - we used a pick or a hatchet to hack it from the back of the rudimentary outdoor toilets by each dwelling. In extremis, dog poo was tolerated as well.\n \n My mother started selling buns and pancakes in the market. She was shattered by the sight of dozens of ragged urchins (some of them little more than toddlers) avidly watching the customers as they ate their pancakes just in case they accidentally dropped some. Then they would dart forwards to pick up scraps and stuff them into their mouths. Some adults, racked with hunger, beat the children and stole from them.\n \n International food aid began to arrive in Onsong, our city, near the border with China. For a while the children started to get their strength back. But then the cadres reduced the rations. First the children had to make do with soup, then with nothing. Their faces were terribly thin, their cheeks were hollow and their eyes bulged with hunger.\n \n The United Nations must have heard that the aid was not being distributed, because an inspection was organised. The party cadres, who had been alerted in advance, had rice delivered to the schools from state storehouses, which were apparently far from empty. The children were told to tell the UN inspectors that this diet was perfectly normal. On the day of the visit there were all kinds of dishes on the menu: noodles, maize souffl\u00e9. Once the UN team set off again, the cadres took back everything, including all the uneaten food from the tables where the children were still sitting.\n \n Hunger engulfed my little universe. The poorest children lived on nothing but grass, and during class their stomachs rumbled. After a few weeks their faces began to swell, making them look well nourished. Then their faces went on growing until they looked as though they had been inflated. Their cheeks were so puffy that they couldn't see the blackboard. Some of them were covered with impetigo and flaking skin.\n \n My classmates started dying during the summer of 1996. One girl spent her days by her dying brother's bedside, going short herself so that he would have more to eat. She died before he did.\n \n As time passed there were fewer and fewer of us sitting at the school desks. Sometimes there were only about 10 in a class of 35. The teachers themselves no longer had enough energy to take their classes. They sat shapelessly in their chairs, cane in hand, while we repeated by heart lessons we had already learnt about the childhoods of Kim Il-sung and his son and successor Kim Jong-il, the Dear Leader.\n \n The famine encouraged the most selfish kinds of behaviour. My grandmother sold soya dishes and soups at home, a little trade that helped her to survive. I remember one father who regularly came to my grandmother's house in secret to eat his fill far from the eyes of his family. Many parents left their homes in search of food, and most didn't come back.\n \n People generally died at night, and every morning we counted five or six deaths in our neighbourhood. Most of them were ordinary people, because neither party cadres nor policemen nor high-ranking military officers suffered as a result of the famine. My father calculated that the district where we lived had shrunk from 4,000 to 2,000 inhabitants.\n \n There were empty houses everywhere. We felt as though we were living in a ghost town. Nonetheless, with my boy's eyes, I found it all relatively normal. It was all I had ever known, and I thought that things abroad must be pretty much the same, or worse, as our leaders told us, assuring us that North Korea was \"paradise\" compared with other states. \n \n \n What the hell does the Eddie Eagle program have to do with indoctrination,and the totalitarian government of the DPRK?come on thats \n something I would expect friend Comrade to come up with... not you.",

   "If \"Eddie Eagle\" is an ineffective program with the real, hidden agenda of promoting gun ownership, then why did the Brady Campaign adopt the program's message nearly word for word? \n \n Here is \"Eddie Eagle\" again (http://www.nrahq.org/safety/eddie/): \n \n \"The Eddie Eagle GunSafe\u00ae Program teaches children in pre-K through third grade four important steps to take if they find a gun. These steps are presented by the program's mascot, Eddie Eagle\u00ae, in an easy-to-remember format consisting of the following simple rules:\n \n If you see a gun: STOP! Don't Touch. Leave the Area. Tell an Adult. [bold emphasis in original]\n \n Now see the plagiarism of the \"Eddie Eagle\" message in the new Brady Campaign video game (Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence) \n \n Check out the launch of the new children and teens interactive gun prevention game! The STOP 2 program provides this virtual game that teaches and reinforces simple steps and skills to implement if children and/or teens find themselves in a situation involving a gun.\n \n The user learns to make safe, smart, healthy, life-saving decisions through five potential scenarios involving guns. The player is rewarded for making the right decisions by earning arcade tokens to play later in up to five mini-games at the arcade. The game changes each time it is played depending on the dialogue choices made by the player.\n \n Be sure to read the parent and teacher prologue to assist you in using the game as educational tool for single or group players.\n \n From the \"parent a teacher prologue\":\n \n Teaching Moments\n Parents and teachers can use this interactive game as an opportunity to instruct and role play with children and teens, by first helping students realize that they can indeed make a choice in any situation, thus empowering them to make the safe choices to never touch a gun, to leave the area/situation immediately and tell an adult and/or authority about the presence of a gun. Teachers and parents can involve an individual or small groups to play the game, pausing to discuss the consequences of available choices and relating them to wise, safe, and healthy decisions and outcomes. \n \n From the game launch window itself:\n \n \"A Day in the Neighborhood\" is a virtual adventure game. The game will take you through real life situations involving firearms where you must make tough, and possibly life altering choices. Like real life, this game is full of choices. You will learn that the best decisions to make when a gun is in your environment is first, not to touch it; secondly, get out of the area where the gun is; and thirdly, tell an adult/authority about the gun. These skills will help you to make smart, wise, and safe choices both in the game and in real life. ",

   "I am in no way demeaning gun accidents. \n   Gun Accidents (and Kids & Gun Accidents) \n The reality does not correspond to the perception created by media coverage. Fatal gun accidents declined by almost sixty percent from 1975 to 1995, even though the number of guns per capita increased by almost forty percent.\n \n Fatal gun accidents involving children (aged 0-14) also fell significantly, from 495 in 1975, to under 250 in 1995. More children die from accidental drownings or burns than from gun accidents. \n (Gun supply statistics are from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, gun accident rates from the National Safety Council). \n \n Automobile = 43,000\n Falls = 16,200\n Poisoning by solids, liquids = 11,700\n Pedestrian1 = 5,300\n Drowning = 3,900\n Fires, burns = 3,600\n Suffocation by ingested object = 3,400\n \n Firearms = 600\n \n Poisoning by gases, vapors = 400\n All other causes = 14,500 \n TOTAL = 97,300\n\n Firearms account for 0.006 of the total accidents. Or 6/10ths of one percent. Someone must be doing something right. \n \n Meanwhile the gun supply has been rising astronomically. There were an estimated 250 million firearms in citizens hands before the background checks were implemented. Note the amount of NICS checks since its inception. In approximately 10 years.\n   Total NICS Background Checks  \n November 30, 1998 - May 31, 2009 \n TOTAL = 102,051,149 \n\n Lets see 102,051,149 divided by 10 gives us an average of 10 million 205 thousand 114.9 checks per year. \n \n Someone must be doing something right. \n \n Must be all of that North Korean style Brain Washing, huh! emoticon_frazzled",

Jolly Roger) warning label for poison. This is because some young children are thought to associate this symbol with pirates and therefore may misinterpret it as an invitation to ingest the poison.[1]\n \n To evaluate the effectiveness of six projected symbols (skull-and-crossbones, red stop sign, and four others), tests were conducted at day care centers. Children in the program rated Mr. Yuk as the most unappealing product. By contrast, children rated the skull-and-crossbones to be the most appealing. [1]\n \n However, at least two peer-reviewed medical studies (Fergusson 1982, Vernberg 1984) have suggested that Mr. Yuk stickers do not effectively keep children away from potential poisons and may even attract children.[2] Specifically, Vernberg and colleagues note concerns for using the stickers to protect young children. Fergusson and colleagues state that \"the method may be effective with older children or as an adjunct to an integrated poisoning prevention campaign.\"[3]\n \n So it kinda sounds like neither work( not enough concrete evidence)so whats the point trying?\n If you can drag Hitler into this, I can drag MR.YUK into it.The point is you keep trying(Galileo).Certain developmental characteristics?my younger daughter was born missing half her right arm,she can drive tacks at 50 yards\n with open or ghost ring sights.

   "\"One could add that totalitarian regimes seem to have an intuitive awareness that it becomes hard for people to change after a certain age, which is why so much effort is made to indoctrinate the young from an early age. For instance, North Korea, the most thoroughgoing totalitarian regime in existence, places children in school from ages two and half to four years; they spend every hour in the cult of adoration for dictator Kim Jong Il and his father, Kim Sun Il.... This continues all the way through school.\"\n (from The Brain That Changes Itself, page 305)\n \n For the same reason the Eddie Eagle program exists. The NRA touts this \"educational\" program under a facade of promoting child safety, but research by public health experts indicates the program is ineffective. Why spend so much money on an ineffective program unless you have a hidden agenda?\n The NRA, like North Korea, realizes that it is much easier to influence and brainwash people while they are young. They know that once a child is indoctrinated in pro-gun ideology it will be much harder for the child to change their point view as they grow older. Thus, the gun industry will have more customers and the NRA will have more check writing members. The gun industry contributes hundreds of thousands of dollars to the NRA through the NRA Foundation. Such money is used to fund the Eddie Eagle program.\n\n \n \n Have you ever read any of the metastudies on the D.A.R.E. program?

Officials said ATF agents then confronted him, he climbed back inside and was arrested and charged as a felon in possession of a gun.\n \n Marroquin, an alleged associate of the prison-based Mexican Mafia, has grown accustomed to such intrusions, having been arrested many times over the years while at the same time being the founder and CEO of No Guns, which has received $1.5 million from Los Angeles City Hall via the much-criticized L.A. Bridges program designed by the Los Angeles City Council to keep youth out of gangs.\n \n \nSpeaking of child molestation, some molesters will try to soften up their intended victims by exposing them to porn.
