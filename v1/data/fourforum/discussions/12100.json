   "A prime example is creationism over evolution. The majority of evidence supports evolution, yet still people push for the teaching of Creationism, despite its lack of evidence.\n \n But this is not a Creationism debate. That was just an example. I'm talking more about religion in general. Any individual is welcome to hold whatever belief they want, but why would someone try to push that belief, especially one with no evidence behind it, on someone else who has a more logical belief? That's where the ridiculousness comes in.\n \n Another good example would be Gay rights issues. There is no evidence to support the bible, and no evidence to suggest that homosexuality is harming anyone, yet Conservative Christians still insist that something is wrong with it because of a sentence or two in their precious bible.",
