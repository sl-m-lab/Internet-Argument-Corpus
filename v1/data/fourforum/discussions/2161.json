But, even if it was not up to par, I would not want to be occupied, with Russians walking the streets with their weapons. \n \n I would probably go with number three in the end also. I agree.

I do fear what would happen at that point and believe that an occupation would be necessary not because I trust or distrust the occupiers, but because it is realistically needed to bring temporary law and leadership to our country.\n \n But to your case, I think things would be different in the US without leadership than they would be in Iraq. I remember watching videos of crowded New York streets on the day that the power went out there and across much of the New England area. It was very civil and there was no real crime spree going on even though people could have probably gotten away with looting at that point. We are used to being governed by rules and seem to follow them without people having to tell us to at this point. It is a sign of good and fair leadership and an intellegent population. But had we been a country of people brought up under a much lesser form of leadership and worse conditions I don't think situations like that would be a civil. This is where I think you are misjudging what our country could and could not do after having a poor leader thrown out. As we stand now we might be a people capable of rebuilding our system of government without major chaos. But put us in the shoes of where the Iraqi people have been for years now and consider they are all without any democratic experience and I think you will just a get a rise of another dictator.

It took two atomic bombs to make them sign the unconditional surrender because they at first refused to sign any surrender that would let the US change their leader.
