   "Some people seem to slur lessons of history. For example, during WWII, Latvian forces committed outrage on humanity together with Nazi war criminals therefore faced Nuremberg war crimes trials. Today, Al-Quaeda militants die of fiendish tortures in CIA covert prison located in... that very same Latvia! \n \n During the latest George W. Bush's journey to Europe, Latvian President Vaira Vike-Freiberga was among the first Eastern European leaders who put forward her country in favor of \"war on terror\". Short later Lithuania, Poland and Bulgaria fell in with the proposal. Today, CIA officers in person and special-purpose state agents empowered personally by Latvian President execute cross-examination in a prison not far from Riga. I wonder what Vike-Freiberga will say in defence when it all crops up? Sure, she is subject to a new Nuremberg proceeding.",
