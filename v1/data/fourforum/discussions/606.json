   "NEW YORK (May 6) - The old-fashioned \"Stick 'em Up\" -- the broad daylight bank robbery more associated with the days of the Wild West than with modern America -- is making a comeback in New York.\n \n Criminologists first noticed the trend late last year when the sluggish economy sent the Big Apple's jobless rate soaring to its highest level in a decade. But hold-ups have tripled this year and now happen as often as three or four times a day. -AP\n \n Guns do not cause crime. It is social ills: violence, unemployment, education, etc.",
