   "I don't know who said it, only that it was a Democrat that appeared on Fox News today. Apparently this person stated that the Democrats will file lawsuits disputing the outcome of the election should Bush win, no matter what the margin of victory. Does this not frighten you Libs/Dems? I'll toot my own horn, I was right about the fact that the Dems/Libs ARE destroying the election process. I realize that if Bush wins by a large margin it would be political suicide, but it DOES give some insight into what they are thinking and what their intentions are.",

   "Yes, I've been hearing it. I'm afraid presidential elections in this country will never be like they were in pre - 2000. There will be lawsuits and long delays in determining who the winner is, no matter what the state of the country.\n \n Reminds me of the close 1960 election, when Nixon refused to persue a valid question about the vote count, putting his country before himself. There is a least a remote chance that a Republican would do that today - NO CHANCE a Democrat would. :(",

   "I hate to disagree with you, but I don't believe that there's even a remote chance that any Republican, Democrat or Other runner is gonna just step aside in this day and time if the vote is close. The winner, no matter who it is has to win by a land-slide in order for the others to keep their lawyers mouths shut. Why do you think that the 2000 election went to the Supreme Court - it didn't appear GWB was willing to step aside.\n \n I personally thought the whole 2000 process was disgusting...........Many of those discrimination rumors people heard were not rumors - they actually happened. Politicians and reporters put whatever spin on things that benefit them and only them. When you're around people that actually get booted, even though they have valid Voter Reg. Cards, because their name is similar or the same as someone else, that's just wrong. Things haven't change much either. Our office does the accounting for several public officials and wanna-bee's. One of my clients came by during the Primaries, she was running under the Dem ticket - guess what - she went to vote in the Primary and with our new computerized system, was given nothing but a Republican ticket. She complained, explained who she was so they took her little credit card looking thing back that goes into this new voting machine we have now and would not allow her to vote since her voters ID didn't match their records.\n \n Being in the heart of not only the State, but the County that had the worst voting mishaps in history, I was ashamed of both parties. My only hope is that these XXXXXX (our candidates) learned something from the 2000 screw up - other than how to better litigate the outcome!! I also hope that the voters have learned to pay more attention to what heck their doing when they go to vote. I'll admit, I had to do a \"triple-take\" on that Butterfly ballot they created for us down here, but anyone that really paid attention could figure it out. I could see where it was confusing to many voters.",

Gotta drag it out, you know.\n\n \n \n I agree that fraud takes place on both sides, and all of it is dispicable and intolerable. However, some of the tactics which I have seen by the Democratic party just blow my mind. For instance, an election day manual in Colorado urges employees to speak out about voter intimidation, give out talking points to prominent black leaders, and if in fact no intimidation occurs, it tells them to \"launch a pre-emptive attack.\" It seems as if the Democratic party has to rely on some tactic like that to attract voters. Here is an instance in Ohio, which in my mind is 100 times worse than hiring 4 workers who allegedly participated in voter fraud in another state. Well, the NAACP in Ohio payed this man, Chad Staton, in the form of crack, to register approximately 124 voters by the name of Mickey Mouse, Jeffrey Dahmer, Mary Poppins, and Janet Jackson. That is utterly vile. \n \n \n They constantly use fear tactics to scare voters to their side by expressing outright lies such as Bush is going to reinstate a draft, privatize Social Security, etc. The Democratic talking point to respond to that is \"Dick Cheney said the chances of us getting hit by terrorists is higher if Kerry is elected.\" First of all, that is an opinion, and it may be out of line. However, the Democrats airing ads that Bush will reinstate a draft and will privatize Social Security is a LIE, not an opinion. Therefore, the Democrats are publicly expressing lies, and using fear to attract voters. The worst example of this is the ad put out by ATC, which is funded by George Soros who is actively working to get Kerry elected. It shows an African-American being sprayed with a fire house, and it says \"This is how Republicans used to keep us from voting\", and then it later says \"Here is how Republicans are trying to keep us from voting now.\" That is absolutely uncalled for.",

   "\"Officers confiscated drug paraphernalia along with voter registration forms from the home. The occupant of the home, Georgianne Pitts, age 41, advised law enforcement, along with Ohio B.C.I.&I., that she had been recruited by Thaddeus J. Jackson, II, of Cleveland, to obtain voter registrations. Pitts admitted to paying Staton crack cocaine for the registrations in lieu of money. A business card provided by Pitts indicated that Jackson is the Assistant NVF Ohio Director of the NAACP National Voter Fund. The initial complaint received by the Sheriff's Office came from the Defiance County Board of Elections. The Board had received the 100 plus registration forms from the Cuyahoga Board of Elections that had been submitted to the Cuyahoga Board by the NAACP National Voter Fund.\"\n \n \n \"Some folks at Ohio's NAACP National Voter Fund may be too anxious to register new voters. The Cuyahoga County elections board recently flagged 17 registration cards submitted by the group's state director, Thaddeus J. Jackson II...The board said that the cards bore signatures that all looked alike. It asked the county prosecutor to investigate the possibility the signatures were forged. Thaddeus J. Jackson II in a written response to the board's inquiry blamed the problem on people below him who collected the cards. Thaddeus J. Jackson II said that he just delivered the cards to the board. What makes the NAACP National Voter Fund initiative unique is that it puts a bounty on each new card, paying volunteers $2 for every card they collect. In his letter, Thaddeus J. Jackson II said the money 'is a stipend to cover expenses.\"\n \n \n A stipend to cover expenses? Since when did crack-cocaine become a legally recognized stipend?",

   "Search me what the answer is. I just came home from a cruise last month. Hawaii. Met a lady there from New Zealand. There were lots from New Zealand and Australia.\n \n She wanted to talk about politics. Said they're following it closely. Said Bush scares them. But that's beside the point. Except that she made us honorary kiwi's and invited us to her down under party. It was pretty clear that Bush supporters wouldn't have been welcome.\n \n She also said that in her country, by law, everyone is required to vote. She said that at least in her country, after an election, they know what everybody thinks. She doesn't understand this system at all.\n \n I really, really. really wish that more Americans could travel enough to get their own, first hand view of the world. I like to sight see like everybody else, but most of all, I love to absorb the other cultures and other peoples. I like to go off the beaten path and just see what there is to see. There's a whole big world out there that's doing fine without us.\n \n The hardest part is overcoming the American stereotype. We've got two strikes against us. Another cruise ship story. My New Zealand lady pointed out an American (she was specific about the American part) that liked to keep 2 chairs on the deck reserved. The ones in the shade were highly in demand and this woman kept one on hold even when she wasn't using it. That stuff makes an impression. The American stories abound - if you can get them to talk to you in the first place. It's sad.\n \n Got a Paris story too. Someday... When I feel like typing more.",
