   "  Ohio AG, Cordray (D), announced CHL statistics. \n Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray (D) has released the concealed handgun license (CHL) statistics for the second quarter of 2010. At the end of June, we had an all time record of approximately 199,577 Ohio residents licensed to carry concealed firearms. \n \n We are now in our seventh year of concealed carry in Ohio and it is clear that the program is popular, successful and growing. Ohio's law became effective in April of 2004. With that initial surge, the second quarter has remained ahead of other years in terms of the average number of licenses issued. While this year's second quarter demand was lower than last year, when there was a spike following President Obama's taking office, the 14,898 regular licenses were still more than 32% higher than the average second quarter numbers.\n \n .... With 200,000 Ohio citizens licensed to carry handguns, anytime you are in a group of five dozen adults, odds are there is one with you. If you are with an older or more affluent group, the odds are even greater. In short, there are few public locations you can travel where there will not be a license-holder near. Unfortunately, because of the many places license-holders are still prohibited from carrying their guns, the license does not necessarily translate into having someone ready and armed to stop an attack.\n",

Klein v. Leis, 99 Ohio St.3d 537, 2003-Ohio-4779.\n {7} Today, we reiterate that the right to bear arms is fundamental\n \n Further, the state correctly asserts that the statute leaves open the ability to bear arms by openly carrying a firearm, satisfying the third prong of the test. \n \n 17. A statute that permits arresting a citizen without regard for whether he is exercising a fundamental right, and encumbers the citizen with the burden of proof, is not narrowly tailored. Cf. Reno v. Am. Civ.

Lott\n American Enterprise Institute Media Bias Against Guns IMPRIMIS\n Sept.2004 (vol.33 no.9)\n Defensive use of handguns in USA statistics\n Moreover, the few defensive gun-use incidents that received coverage were almost all reported locally. Though articles about gun crimes are treated as both local and national stories, defensive uses of guns are given only local coverage in the rare instances they run at all. In the full sample of defensive gun-use stories I have collected, less than one percent ran outside the local coverage area. News about guns only seems to travel if it's bad.\n This helps explain why residents of urban areas favor gun control. Most crime occurs in big cities, and urbanites are bombarded with tales of gun-facilitated crime. It happens that most defensive gun uses also occur in these same cities, but they simply aren't reported. \n \n sinjin:perhaps they see themselves as victims because the media ingrains it\n into them that they are and the only way not to be, is rid the populace of all firearms,which of course is B.S.\n I suggest read the entire link(which I'm sure most have elsewhere).\n And yes there's that 4 letter word Lott.",
