   "But Ah...Not everyone who earns minimum wage does so to make a living. Consider the high school student living at home who works 20 hrs per week and is chiefly concerned with raising money for I tunes and cheeseburgers. That employee is not looking for long-term employment and is not interested in benefits such as medical insurance or family leave. That employee has a competitive advantage over the full time employee which is only made larger as wages are increased for reason of government intervention rather than increased employee skill. \n \n Each employee carried on payroll represents an hourly \"cost\" to the employer. Factors in cost include salary, sick time, vacation, various government taxes and social engineering such as the family medical leave act. That cost is justified by the value the employee returns to the employer. Factors in value include productivity, initiative, creative thinking, etc. In some industries, the employee must return a factor of 3.5 times cost to create profit for the employer. Assuming that the value an employee generates remains static in the face of a cost increase (such as a government mandated wage increase), the business owner must compensate by reducing costs in other areas. The first likely cost reduction comes from the employee's benefit package, namely, medical insurance. This may come in a form as simple as eliminating coverage for full-time employees, eliminating wage increases for employees above minimum wage, or replacing full time workers with part-time workers. \n \n Thus, the pursuit of a \"livable wage\" instead of helping the mother of four helps the student, the retiree, and the second wage holder.",

   "As to the matter of a society being decent or not based upon its preference for socialized medicine one can afford to moralize when one can effectively control the influx of poor to one's country. Given the rather porous state of the US border with Mexico and given that Mexico's leading export is its poor, I do not see growing enthusiasm among the American middle class for socialized medicine. Were the UK to receive a similar influx, perhaps the social dynamic would be different. Perhaps if the US had a moat similar to the Channel, its citizenry would be more inclined to approve greater safety nets for its downtrodden. But unlike the UK where the influx of unskilled is rather static, in the United States, it is not a case of the poor getting poorer, but of the Poor getting \"morer\" if you will pardon a Seussian term. The US could improve the income disparity quite suddenly by abandoning its embrace of \"the tired, poor, huddled masses\" and instead wishing them smooth sailing to our former liege lords in the North Atlantic.\n \n Second, I recognize that not all students, college or high school are engaged solely in frivolous commercial pursuits. Rather, my intent was to demonstrate that even the noblest of college student savings needs (saving for the university) pales in comparison to the needs of that mother of 4, and by so doing, illustrate the problem inherent in attempting a one-size fits all answer. \n \n Third, Your personal sense that an organization should limit the upward compensation of senior employees demonstrates a recurring theme in the minimum wage debate. Opponents of the minimum wage do not argue in favor of making minimum wage earners poorer, but proponents invariably state that there should be a limit on how much money an individual should make. The student who mows the lawn outside the hospital should not impact the earning power of the Heart Surgeon. \n \n You are not, in truth, paid what you are worth, you are paid what your job is worth. Your talents and abilities thus impact your abilities to secure a living. If you have a limited talent range, you have limited job opportunities and thus, limited earning power. If your sphere of talent manages to generate revenue for your employer at a rate higher than others, you will be compensated at a rate higher than others. Thus, the Heart Surgeon, who can operate on your vena cava AND mow the lawn, has a superior earning potential than the groundskeeper who can trim the verge, but is somewhat befuddled by the pericardium.",

   "Living Wage = Decent residence, decent nutrition, decent level of medical care, living security for one's old age, enough time for leisure pursuits (supporting the arts, crafts, etc., participating as an artist), access to education that prepares one to survive and make a living, and a bunch of other stuff.\n\n \n \nTo me a living wage is one which permits the earner to pay for all the essentials (for a small family): housing, heating, lighting, nutritious food, clothing, health insurance in some places etc, plus the things necessary to obtain a better job in the future, telephone, at least dialup internet access, training, transportation, plus about 10% to save for when things need replacing like cookers, washing machines, winter coats, computers.\n\n \n So what you're saying is, a \"living wage\" is an amount of money required to reach a standard of living you personally find palatable?",

   "I think that a living wage means different things to different people (as evidenced by some of the posts in this thread).\n To me a living wage means enough money keep yourself alive (i.e. to have a roof over your head, food in your stomach, clothes on your back and that's it).\n \n I'm a firm believer in the theory that in a true free market economy the market itself will set the standard for a living wage. But unfortunately we all live in a society which sees heavy government intervention in all markets and as such we will never get to see how much a living wage would be in a true capitalist society.",

   "It makes sense, possibly, to pay a corporate executive $50 MM a year if said executive delivers results. However, we see time and time again where said pricey execs have run the companies they manage into the ground and exit with golden parachutes. Companies should be well-managed. Does anyone have a problem with expecting corporations to be well-managed? \n\n \n We see it time and time again because it's rare, it's big news. We see news reports of plane crashes time and time again, but that doesn't mean they happen all the time. It's very common for corporations to be well managed. \n \n \n \nFrankly, I never tackled a tranny but I could change plugs and check the wiring and was on the verge of learning how to adjust carburators when corporate greed intervened and remachined automobiles so that they have to be diagnosed with complex computer systems that only the corporations are privy to. But in those golden olden days, I could have found a mechanic who could rebuild a tranny for cheaper than a car corporation charges. \n\n \n That's not the point. He was saying that there's no one person who fully understands every detail of even simple economic transitions, let alone complex ones. Therefore, no one person has the knowledge to manipulate them. \n \n \n \nI don't think it would take very long for someone to figure out how to build a machine that turns out a nice pencil, bunches of them, if they just put their minds to it. But why bother--and why go to the expense when you can walk into any grocery or drugstore or elsewhere and walk way with hundreds of already manufactured pencils for cheap? \n\n \n That's exactly right. It's YOUR suggestion that we \"bother\", so pencil making laborors can make a \"living wage\". Then, chances are good that when we go to the grocery or drugstore, pencils won't be cheap - or maybe not even available. \n \n \n \nNuts! A nicely built pencil is not that complex a process. Not that I could pull it off but someone with a nice understanding of machinery, materials and processes could run up a rig and tinker with it until it functioned quite efficiently. \n\n \n See above, if it's mandated that one person do that, despite the fact that free markets have several people doing it, prices and availability will change for the worse. \n \n \nAlready dismantled the myth of the lead pencil. Next? \n\n \n Not hardly. \n \n \nPeople who don't worry about income disparities are shooting themselves in the butt. If people are poorly paid, who the Hades is going to consume? Consumers need money to buy stuff. \n\n \n The percentage of people who are poorly paid is small enough so that it's working just fine in the U.S. The ones who are poorly paid need to ask themselves if it's the company's fault, society's fault, or their own fault. \n \n \n \nThis is condescending as all Hades. I can't imagine politicians butting into the salary policies of individual companies. \n\n \n I can - it happens every time there is a minimum wage increase. \n \n \nHowever, the activities of companies which benefit from doing business in the United States, and get all the protections to said companies offered by our government, they shouldn't get away with not paying for those benefits by registering offshore in order to pay taxes for services rendered. \n\n \n If they didn't, they'd have even less money to pay \"living wages\" to their employees, wouldn't they?\n \n \nOr, when companies such as Enron do major damage to the American economy and millions of American citizens who hold stocks and bonds or are employees of companies savaged by Enron greed, politicians should butt in and kick butt.\n\n \n That's really another subject.",

In any case, governments always intervene in economics - interest rates anyone? Governments subsidise, they tax, they build infrastructure. Are none of these interfering with economics? \n\n \n There are different divisions of intervention - it's possible for governments to set interest rates, tax and build infrastructure, yet let pencil makers decide for themselves how much they are going to pay their workers.

   "\"you are paid what your job is worth\"\n \n That is simply untrue, you are paid the least that your employer can get away with paying you, this is why increases in the minimum wage in the UK haven't resulted in increased unemployment. What you say might be true in a market with perfect information, perfect labour mobility etc. but it's not true in the real world\n \n In any case, the immigration argument is fundamentally flawed, because non-EU immigrants aren't entitled to free treatment in the UK, except for those countries with reciprocal agreements like New Zealand. Also, while UK immigration has been relatively low, it's worth noting that any EU citizen, rich or poor, may choose to move here and work at any time. I challenge you to say that the EU accession countries are significantly wealthier than Mexico.\n\n \n Your argument actually proves my point. The job is worth what someone is paid to do it for. If an employer offers a job at a set salary and no one takes it, then the employer is forced to raise the offered salary are they not? Plus, last I checked, entering into employment was a completely voluntary pursuit. No one forces you to take that minimum wage job and no one forces the employer to hire you. True, you will be paid the minimum amount to keep you from quitting. At the same time, you will typically work only so hard as to prevent your firing. In either case, the fact of the matter is you will earn what you command. If you have no marketable skills, you have no bargaining power. I am not saying this to be cruel, I am saying this to be realistic. What you are asking for is an increase in pay without an increase in work. You would find me equally unreasonable if I suggested an increased workload from you without agreeing to additional compensation. \n \n As to the immigration comparison. I will confess to complete abject ignorance of the term free treatment. My point was that the UK simply does not have the preponderance of illegal low-income immigrants that the US faces. EU members find it considerably harder to illegally immigrate into the UK compared to the north traveling pedestrians from our neighbors to the South who may merely stroll northward. I figure anyone who could swim the channel should be immediately granted citizenship because that is exactly the kind of stalwart character you want. \n \n Inform me also whether the UK grants citizenship to babies born of illegal aliens within its borders as is the policy in the US. Again, I am hopelessly ignorant of whether this is the case. \n \n My respects,",

What you are asking for is an increase in pay without an increase in work. You would find me equally unreasonable if I suggested an increased workload from you without agreeing to additional compensation. \n \n\n \n The only part of your agrument that I contend is this. Just because you have no marketable skills doesn't mean you have no bargaining power. You still have the option to work for less. This is the one bargaining chip that a minimum wage law takes away from the unskilled labor force. This is another reason why striving for a living wage by using the minimum wage is criminal toward people who are unskilled. An employer is going to hire the most skilled laborer he/she can for the minimum wage. Without the option to work for less than the more skilled laborer, the less skilled laborer makes nothing because he/she will not be employed. I weep when I think of the utter ignorance of supporting a minimum wage. emoticon_cry",
