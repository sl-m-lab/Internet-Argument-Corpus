   "This story interested me\n \n Royal Festival Hall removes sculpture by child murderer Colin Pitchfork - Times Online\n \n Now I don't want to debate his art as I have no appreciation for visual art whatsoever (well except for lowbrow stuff such as comics, graffiti and tattoos).\n \n But I have been struggling to form an opinion on prisoners for a long time. Should they be punished or rehabilitated and where is the line drawn? if there a need for life sentences would it be better to put them to death? When a prisoner is freed has he paid his debt to society and how does this affect his victims' rights? I also have side issues such as I wonder if motive or indeed psychological reasons matters and lastly, should be allowed to vote?\n \n If this comes across as a messy, jumbled and confused post it only means that I have expressed myself perfectly. I can see I am offering choices between black and white areas whereas everything is, I assume, gray.\n \n I know that I have brought up too many issues for one thread so please only answer the points that interest you.\n \n Finally please feel free to suggest reading material as I have a whole summer coming up to sit on a beach and read about the imprisoned.",

From what I've seen, the death penalty does have somewhat of a deterrent effect but if we are going to have it all appeals and DNA testing etc should be made available to the convict (it actually costs more to execute someone than to lock them up for life, so we should reserve death for the worst of the worst).\n \n 4.

No one really has 'societies' interest at heart...there's no room there since it's dominated by selfish desires.\n \n Support Zardoz for pres 2012.\n And how do you support Z when you don't vote?\n Shoot those who oppose me!\n \n MuAhahahahhahaha",
