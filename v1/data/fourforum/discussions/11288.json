   "Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, those pioneering women, are now, finally, legally married. Spouses for life.....beginning at ages 87 and 83. When I was much younger, I read their book Lesbian/Woman.\n \n It's the older gay people for whom these changes hold so much meaning, after all the years of struggle and pain. It's the older people for whom this victory, this opportunity, finally, to marry legally, is especially sweet.\n \n Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon have been spouses in fact for 55 years. They got married legally once before, 4 years ago, when Mayor Gavin Newsome began issuing marriage licenses. Then a court declared their marriage void. Now they are married again, for the final time, I hope. \n \n Congratulations to them and to all the newly married couples: spouses for life.",
