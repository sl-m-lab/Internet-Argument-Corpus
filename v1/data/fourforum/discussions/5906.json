Wasn't a majority of UK citizens against Blair's alignment with US invasion/occupation of Iraq and subsequent US Lapdog moniker?\n\n I'm guessing support for ID cards will increase, if the Government mentions they might reduce terrorist attacks in the future (regardless of whether they will or, more likely, won't). Support for the Iraq war may increase slightly, although Iraq wasn't really to do with terrorists, although I'm sure the government can link this to Iraq. Support for some dumb-XXX \"anti-terror\" laws that strip us of our civil liberties may increase, but I still reckon people will be against such measures. The Tories are likely to subtly link this to their immigration policies, while the Lib Dems will most likely link this to the UK being the US's lapdog, while also hinting that without the Iraq war, this may not have happened.\n \n My very early predictions at least.\n \n Being honest, I doubt all that much will change though. We've had the IRA bombing us for long enough, it's not some completely new thing, and the scale is no-where near 11/9 for example.\n \n If it were up to me, I'd just move on and carry on as we're going.

That's really having the tail wag the dog. \n \n And by the time we arrived in Afghanistan, it was Pakistan that was harboring Bin Laden. The Taliban, our allies prior to 9/11 due to DEA money to eradicate poppy production, were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now Afghanistan is just a smaller mess than Iraq.\n\n You truly do not know what harbor means do you? Or do you have your own dictionary? Since you do not understand it after many attempts, I am done trying to educate you. Whatever you want 'harbor' to mean for you, have fun.\n \n Countries root that out the old fashioned way: infiltration and investigation. And as I have stated before, this MUST be done w/in the limits of enforcement. None of the Constitution stepping actions like the Patriot Act. You can over-dramatize whatever you want, but it is the failing of intel that allows this XXXX. And proper intel need not Orwell everyone. That is the tactic of the weak, lazy, and idiotic.\n \n The Taliban refused to hand over Al Qaeda (btw, in case you do not know that encompasses more than 1 person), they got what they deserved.\n \n And if you think Afghanistan is a mess, you must have a rather OCD vision of the world. They are democratic, they are improving, and their citizens are seeing more freedom than most have in their lifetime.",

Face it, it's a region where there are resources everyone wants. \n \n \n\n The Muslim extremists of the Uighur region of China have been demanding a separate Islamic republic for last seven years. In early 1997, the Uighurs stepped up their militant campaign against Beijing's rule in East Turkestan. The Islamic fundamentalist group known as \"Uighurstan Liberation Front\" and \"the United National Revolutionary Front\" of East Turkestan shelved their differences and united for the purpose of Jihad (Islamic holy war) and the separation of Uighur from China. The idea was to forge a coherent militant movement from the base in neighboring Kazakhstan.\n \n The territory of Xinjiang, which is a rich resource for oil encompassing 660,000 square miles and about 1,000 miles from the sea, is a convenient location for the Chinese Muslim militants. The Xinjiang region is closer to Islamic countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan, countries that are notorious for their involvement in international terrorism.\n \n In February 1997 the Uighur fundamentalists burst into flame when three young Muslim extremists were charged with murders and executed in Xinjiang's capital, Urumchi. Several hundred Uighur demonstrators took to the streets of Gulag, near the Kazakh border, demanding a separate state for the ethnic Muslims. When the police turned water cannon on them in freezing temperatures, the demonstration exploded into a two-day running battle.\n \n The violence in February, 97 sparked more terrorist activities among the Uighurs. Later that month Uighur Muslim extremists planted bombs on three Urumchi buses, killing at least 18 people. Between March and May, 1997 Uighurs claimed responsibility for a series of fatal bombings in Beijing. It was also reported that the fundamentalists had set fire to an oil refinery near Karamay and attacked several oil convoys.\n \n Chinese newspapers published news about an incidence where a machine-gun and grenade attack by Muslim militants left 16 policemen dead in the tense southwestern city of Khotan. By late April 1997 China arrested at least a hundred of these Uighur militants and executed at least sixteen. During the search operation, Chinese police seized seven tons of explosives, 600 illegal firearms and 31,000 rounds of ammunition, as well as truckloads of Muslim fundamentalist literature, which encourage open Jihad against China.\n \n Over a period of last few years, the sporadic outbreaks of violence and unrest throughout different parts of Xinjiang have culminated into a typical organized Islamic terrorism. The Chinese Government has recognized it as a potential threat to the stability of the whole country and has launched a major offensive on the Islamic terrorists in this region.\n",

Al Qaeda probably has more recruits than they could ever have hoped for because of the foolish and ill-planned invasion of Iraq. The world has not become safer at all because of the invasion.\n \n To defeat terrorists you have to do two things:\n \n 1) You take out the current active extremists quickly, subtly and quietly. Dropping 2000 pound bombs on suspected terrorist camps and subsequently killing civilians in the process like recently in Afghanistan only creates more recruits, use Special Forces instead.\n Furthermore, when you take out a cell, don't advertise it, keep it quiet, don't blast it all over the media. Nobody needs more martyrs.\n \n 2) Stop ******* Muslims off. Stop supporting Israel and the Sauds. Pull out of Iraq. Stop screwing around with Iran. Shut down GITMO, move the operations somewhere else and do it quietly.",

They're Catholics and have democracy and capitalism just like us, yet the terrorists leave them alone.\n\n \n I'm glad others have also noticed these points.\n \n Was our involvement in the invasion of Iraq the sole cause of the bombings in London? no, but it bloody well didn't move us down the list of potential targets for AQ did it?\n \n And to those who say \"London's seen it before- the IRA etc....\" just remember: the IRA, except for a few attacks by the RIRA were not interested in \"bodycount\" terrorism, unlike AQ.",

   "MUHAMMAD'S EARLY TERRORIST ACTS\n \n After moving to Medina, Muhammad began to have conflict with the Jews and pagans in the area. I'll focus on several incidents, not necessarily in chronological order, that illustrate Muhammad as a terrorist. The first terrorist incident involves Muhammad's command to his followers to \"kill any Jew that comes under your power\". From Guillaume, op cit, page 369:\n \n \"The apostle said, \"Kill any Jew that falls into your power.\" Thereupon Muhayyisa b. Masud leapt upon Ibn Sunayna, a Jewish merchant with whom they had social and business relations, and killed him. Huwayyisa was not a Muslim at the time though he was the elder brother. When Muhayyisa killed him Huwayyisa began to beat him, saying, 'You enemy of God, did you kill him when much of the fat on your belly comes from his wealth?\" Muhayyisa answered, \"Had the one who ordered me to kill him ordered me to kill you I would have cut your head off.\"\n \n This story is also supported in the Sunan of Abu Dawud, Book 19, Number 2996:\n \n Narrated Muhayyisah: The Apostle of Allah said: If you gain a victory over the men of Jews, kill them. So Muhayyisah jumped over Shubaybah, a man of the Jewish merchants. He had close relations with them. He then killed him. At that time Huwayyisah (brother of Muhayyisah) had not embraced Islam. He was older than Muhayyisah. When he killed him, Huwayyisah beat him and said: O enemy of Allah, I swear by Allah, you have a good deal of fat in your belly from his property.\n \n This murder was committed upon Muhammad's command. Note that this Muslim murderer would have killed a family member at the drop of a hat. Muhammad was no better than a bigoted criminal boss, ordering his men to wantonly murder Jewish people. Hitler did this. And, this is what the Serbs did to the Kosovan Muslims. Muhammad's command to murder Jews puts him in the same category as Milosovic, Hitler, and others who have persecuted Jews throughout history. A quote from an Islamic scholar - Wensinck writes in his, \"Muhammad and the Jews of Medina\" [2], page 113:\n \n \"It is remarkable that tradition attributes Muhammad's most cruel acts to divine order, namely the siege of Qaynuqa, the murder of Kab, and he attack upon Qurayzah. Allah's conscience seems to be more elastic than that of his creatures.\".....Ibn Ishaq and al-Waqidi report that the prophet said the morning after the murder (of Kab Ashraf), \"Kill any Jew you can lay your hands on.\"\n \n This incident is also documented in Tabari's History [3], page 97 of volume 7. This shows that Muhammad had unsuspecting people, those who even had good relations with Muslims, murdered in cold blood because they were Jewish. There was no justification to murder these Jews other than they were not Muhammad's followers. These actions were the work of Muhammad's terrorists committing murder.\n \n The second terrorist incident involves another one of Muhammad's requests: this one for his men to murder an old Jewish man named Abu Afak. Abu Afak was 120 years. Afak had urged his fellow Medinans to question Muhammad. From Guillaume, op cit., page 675:\n \n SALIM B. UMAYR'S EXPEDITION TO KILL ABU AFAK\n \n Abu Afak was one of the B. Amr b. Auf of the B. Ubayda clan. He showed his disaffection when the apostle killed al-Harith b. Suwayd b. Samit and said:\n \n \"Long have I lived but never have I seen\n An assembly or collection of people\n More faithful to their undertaking\n And their allies when called upon\n Than the sons of Qayla when they assembled,\n Men who overthrew mountains and never submitted,\n A rider who came to them split them in two (saying)\n \"Permitted\", \"Forbidden\", of all sorts of things.\n Had you believed in glory or kingship\n You would have followed Tubba\n \n [NOTE: the Tubba was a ruler from Yemen who invaded that part of what is present Saudi Arabia: the Qaylites resisted him]\n \n The apostle said, \"Who will deal with this rascal for me?\" Whereupon Salim b. Umayr, brother of B. Amr b. Auf, one of the \"weepers\", went forth and killed him. Umama b. Muzayriya said concerning that:\n \n You gave the lie to God's religion and the man Ahmad! [Muhammad]\n By him who was your father, evil is the son he produced!\n A hanif gave you a thrust in the night saying\n \"Take that Abu Afak in spite of your age!\"\n Though I knew whether it was man or jinn\n Who slew you in the dead of night (I would say naught).\n \n Additional information is found in the Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir, (Book of the Major Classes) by Ibn Sa'd, Volume 2, [4], page 32:\n \n Then occurred the \"sariyyah\" [raid] of Salim Ibn Umayr al-Amri against Abu Afak, the Jew, in [the month of] Shawwal in the beginning of the twentieth month from the hijrah [immigration from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD], of the Apostle of Allah. Abu Afak, was from Banu Amr Ibn Awf, and was an old man who had attained the age of one hundred and twenty years. He was a Jew, and used to instigate the people against the Apostle of Allah, and composed (satirical) verses [about Muhammad]. Salim Ibn Umayr who was one of the great weepers and who had participated in Badr, said, \"I take a vow that I shall either kill Abu Afak or die before him. He waited for an opportunity until a hot night came, and Abu Afak slept in an open place. Salim Ibn Umayr knew it, so he placed the sword on his liver and pressed it till it reached his bed. The enemy of Allah screamed and the people who were his followers, rushed to him, took him to his house and interred him.\n \n From a contemporary Muslim scholar - Ali Dashti's \"23 Years: A Study of the Prophetic Career of Mohammad\", [5], page 100:\n \n \"Abu Afak, a man of great age (reputedly 120 years) was killed because he had lampooned Mohammad. The deed was done by Salem b. Omayr at the behest of the Prophet, who had asked, \"Who will deal with this rascal for me?\" The killing of such an old man moved a poetess, Asma b. Marwan, to compose disrespectful verses about the Prophet, and she too was assassinated.\"\n \n Prior to listing all of the assassinations Muhammad had ordered, Ali Dashti writes on page 97:\n \n \"Thus Islam was gradually transformed from a purely spiritual mission into a militant and punitive organization whose progress depended on booty from raids and revenue from the zakat tax.\n \n \n http://www.muhammadanism.org/Muhammad/muhammad_terrorism.htm#Beginning",
