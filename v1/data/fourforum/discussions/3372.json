   "I searched and search and searched the web and couldn't find a website anywhere for a group that claims homosexuality is curable that is non-religious in nature. If the theory that gays can change is true iti should be represented in science somewhere. RIght? \n \n For all you christians out there, here is the challenge:\n \n Find me one group out there claiming that gays can change, that does not invovle GOD in that change. So that leaves NARTH, Exodus and Free to be me out of it. Excluded would be any group claiming jesus, god, or faith is the cure!\n \n go fo it!\n \n \n I bet we get no reply's.",
