   "sglaine put together a very good subject. I would like to expand on it mor by asking this: What is the best bass guitars in your opinion? I play an Ibanez SR-400 Soundgear bass which I absolutely love. Primarily for its feel and sound. I used to own a '78 Fender Precision for about 19 years which I also liked (wish I never parted with it emoticon_cool )",

She is heavy as hell - but sounds oh so pretty. I ounce picked up a Fender Prodigy and fell in love because it was small and I have small girl hands. \n \n I am not as well versed on what basses are THE BEST as I probably should be, but I have heard nothing but fond words from owners of MusicMan basses.",

You can get a solid bottom or a trebly twang with any model. I would say find the scale that fits your hands like jitobear alludes to. That would be the most important.",

Not only that I play one myself, but,based on experience and my 23+ years of bass, I think it may serve you well. :) :)",

I wouldn't give twp cents for most Peavey guitars (but their amps kick butt.) But the Cirrus rocks. Get ready to spend some money though. The Cirrus don't come cheap.
