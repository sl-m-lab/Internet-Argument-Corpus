   "Americans start \"velvet revolution\" in Central Asia\n Kyrghyz authorities are now fiercely reacting against spreading Islamic fundamentalism and now and then take in charge Khizb ut-Takhrir militants. More and more often they started to confiscate leaflets and booklets calling to make a \"velvet revolution\". As distinguished from the other religious and subversive reading matter distributed by Khizb ut-Takhrir, the revolutionary booklets are of finest typeset quality. Some experts designate they were typed out and duplicated on publishing equipment of American and English make. As a matter of fact, Afghanistan is the only place in the region where there is such equipment.",

It seems that local culture and nationalism keep getting in the way. \n \n I can't help but look at Roman, Mongol and other conquests as comparative to US attempts at spreading democracy. All used (use) superior military to defeat local forces to take their resources. The Romans and Mongols then permanently stationed their armies in the vanquished areas, where they assimilated into local cultures including cohabitation and joining clans/tribes, effectively becoming localized government complete with tax collection and social contribution. To most Americans, and the former British Empire, to do so is too 'foreign' and seems to be rejected in large by the driving force of Christian morality not approving of different belief systems or cultural aspects.

The recent 'election' there is showing candidates supported by a coalition of Shia Clerics drubbing the US puppet with a Kurd coalition following that of the Shia Clerics. Any American believing our brand of equality actually appeals to the leadership of a nation filled with warring tribes and clans and historically united only by belief system law or a secular iron fist might as well be pitching Satanism to the Vatican. \n \n While the US has repeatedly attempted to force American Democracy on most of S. America, Vietnam and parts of the ME, we have yet to successfully spawn a working example simply because we're so conceited we feel that our ideology can be utilized anywhere in the world regardless of local culture, belief system or the will of the people. Not so. Venezuela has to be the most embarrassing example of how our desires lack realism. After our efforts to instill democracy there, the people actually voted in a socialist leaning government that despises US manipulation to gain resources. The very nerve of them doing that.",

   "Actually Venezuela has been very democratic for quite a long time. The current leader Hugo Chavez, a former Paratrooper in the Venezuelan army tried to overthrow a corrupt government in the early 90's failed and was sent to jail. The government he tried to overthrow was thrown out of power based on corruption charges, and Chavez was pardoned. \n \n Then in 1998 Chavez was elected and has since had 6 national votes in which he has one them all. One of which was for a new constitution which allowed for the 2004 Aug 15 or so recall election which he won while having the most election observers ever (at the time)\n \n The US doesnt like Chavez for a few reasons, \n \n He is nationalistic, in wanting Venezuelan oil money to benifit all Venezuelans and improve the education and health care of all in Venezuela. He has started this by the doctors for oil deal with Cuba, which of course has ****** off the anti Castro Cubans in South Florida.\n \n During the economic crisis caused by the oil Strike instead of following the World Bank and IMF directives he followed his own path which instead of hurting the poorest Venezuelans, it caused the wealthiest some problems in currency exchanges.\n \n Last, he is quite independant and critical of the US ( partially to gain support in Venezuela) given that Venezuela is in the top 5 for oil exports to the US, this is not a good thing. \n \n Surpisingly he has survived economic crisiises, a coup attempt and 3 elections that would have removed him from power ( all relatively clean ).",
