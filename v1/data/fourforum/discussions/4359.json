Often the people who declare that it is consitutional are ignoring the fact that if the government allows one religion's code of law to be shown in the court, they often take serious offense to another religion's code of law. Obviously the government cannot favor one religion over another, and merely showing a single religion's code of law and not others is obvious favoring and unconsitutional. It is legally permissable for the federal government to prohibit religious displays or religious expression on public property if they favor one religion over another, which is percisely what occured with the 10 commandements issue. \n \n I do remember stating this: \"Let's take this in another direction:\"\n \n When I can merely quote myself off of something you quoted me and disprove your attack upon my argument, doesn't that mean your argument is fundementally weak and flawed? :) \n \n \n\n By should, do you mean required to? The answer is no since the First Amendment forbids such a requirement.\n\n \n Not necessarily. If the government allows such a display of one religion, it must therefore accomadate every other religion. The 1st ammendemnent clearly states that the government cannot favor one religion over another. IF they so choose to allow the 10 commandements to be displayed, they must therefore display the legal code of every other religion. \n \n \nThe question is whether it is permissable for the govt to prohibit such a display.\n\n \n It's not that simple. You're still ignoring the exclusion of other religions while favor a specific one. \n \n \n\n Judges are to be evaluating based on their interpretation and application of existing laws, not their religious preferences. If a member of my state supreme court is a muslim who wishes to display the Koran's legal foundations, it's perfectly acceptable to me provided an existing law didn't require it.\n\n \n Alright.

   "So the real issue here is favoritism or perhaps a more appropriate term if I may: religious discrimination.\n\n \n Well, I also had a side tangent to hit the hypocrites who say they support the 1st ammendement but litterally condemn you to hell for even talking about hanging other religion's in the same location. \n \n \nIf I read you correctly, the government must forbid the public expression of any faith unless all faiths are expressed in equal amounts in the same place at the same time.\n\n \n Expression is a vague word. The government must forbid the allowance of specific religious symbols on federal/state property if a (let's go with reasonable, some tiny cult of 5 people in my book doesn't count) amount of other religions are not present. Allowing just one code of law of one religion is favoring if other religions are not presented. \n \n \nI think it's safe to say that no public exercise of faith could possibly meet that standard and that is just way too convenient.\n\n \n Most public exercises of faith are not on federal/state property.

The 10 commandements on trial is dealing specifically with displays of religious codes on law in a court, which is either state or federal propety. Congress isn't dealing with public exercises of faith outside of state/federal property. I should have clarified that long ago, but I thought it was a accepted basis for the argument. \n \n \nThe constitution strictly forbids laws that prohibit any religious expression. What all faiths enjoy is equal PROTECTION.\n\n \n Problem with that argument. If we allow one religion's code of law, we are essentially enacting a law that favors one religion over the other, that would be a law dealing with the establishment of a religion, which is a clear no no. The consitution does not strictly forbid laws that prohibit, but instead forbids any law that deals with the establishment, whether favoring or disfavoring. Only showing one religion on a federal/state property is enacting a law that respects the establishment of that religion.",

   "First, a clarification: When I say public, I mean on state/federal owned property, not just outside of someones house. Sorry for the confusion and misunderstanding.\n \n The original question stated was:\n \n\n Is it legally permissable for the federal government to prohibit religious displays or religious expression on public property? \n\n \n The answer I'm getting in response from one individual is:\n \nIf we allow one religion's code of law, we are essentially enacting a law that favors one religion over the other, that would be a law dealing with the establishment of a religion, which is a clear no no. The consitution does not strictly forbid laws that prohibit, but instead forbids any law that deals with the establishment, whether favoring or disfavoring. \n\n \n The question in the Ten commandments cases before the court is whether these displays are unconstitutional. Well, if this isn't a serious misunderstanding then I don't know what is. \"If we allow one religion's code of law, we are essentially enacting a law\". Ok stop right there. How does a Ten commandments display constitute the enactment of a law? There is no law. No such law exists. Individuals, working in the court, freely chose to display the commandments as an expression of their religious faith, which is constitutionally protected (congress shall make no law.. prohibiting the free exercise thereof). The rights of non-christians are not being violated. There is no requirement to observe christiantity or obey the commandments or even to look at them.\n \n \nThe consitution does not strictly forbid laws that prohibit, but instead forbids any law that deals with the establishment, whether favoring or disfavoring.\n\n \n That's not quite what I said.\n \n\n The constitution strictly forbids laws that prohibit any religious expression.\n\n \n I should revise that to say any voluntary religious expression but I thought that was self evident. Yes the constitution does prohibit laws that would respect establishment one way or another. I Can't argue with your observation in this regard.\n \n I want to stress this point: My emphasis here is on the voluntary exercise of faith on public property whatever form it takes. There is no free exercise of religion if people are not free to exercise their religion on public property. It is a clear misunderstanding of the 1st Amendment if one interprets it to mean no public official can exercise their faith in a courtroom, or a school or in the capitol building. The free expression of faith and the voluntary display of religous symbols or commandments on public property are not the object of our constitution in regards to what is or is not allowed. Only existing laws and statutes passed by legislative bodies can be declared unconstitutional. The free, voluntary, uncoerced expression of faith and display of religious symbols cannot. We should have no desire to shut down anybody's right to religious expression on public property under any pretext given our bill or rights because then I or you or anybody else will be next to be shut down.\n \n This is not an emotional appeal to christians or conservatives. I'm not attempting to preach to the choir. Everybody has a stake in the outcome of these Supreme Court cases. It could set the bar at a certain level giving the government certain powers it should not possess to restrict rights it was duty bound to uphold and defend. We have seen a steady erosion of rights for quite awhile and it is my hope that this Supreme Court will begin to reverse that trend starting now.",

How does a Ten commandments display constitute the enactment of a law? There is no law.

Simply because perhaps a court is setting the precedent does not mean they are free to bypass amendements if they so choose to. While it is not technically a law, it is a precedent that will allow other such acts to occur. Courts base their decisions on the decisions of the past. Allowing such a flagrant violation of government religious favoritism can hardly be constitutional. \n \n http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/01.html#1\n \n \nIndividuals, working in the court, freely chose to display the commandments as an expression of their religious faith, which is constitutionally protected (congress shall make no law.. prohibiting the free exercise thereof).\n\n \n On the contrary, individuals working in the court are state and federal employees and are subject to the jurisidiction and the laws set by that work place. They cannot simply start putting up one religion's code of law because they feel so. \n \n \nThe rights of non-christians are not being violated. There is no requirement to observe christiantity or obey the commandments or even to look at them.\n\n \n No one argued that their rights are not being violated. It is merely that government is now favoring one religion over another; whether people want to look or not is irrelvent. A blanant unconsitutional act is still a blanant unconsitutional regarldess if anyone is watching. \n \n \n\n I want to stress this point: My emphasis here is on the voluntary exercise of faith on public property whatever form it takes.\n\n \n Whatever form? There is a clear line behind government backed and condoned voluntary exercise of faith on government property and government free voluntary exercise of faith. The 10 commandemnts as allowed by the government in its own property can hardly be argued not to be free of government intervesion, if not outright favortism, \n \n \nThere is no free exercise of religion if people are not free to exercise their religion on public property. It is a clear misunderstanding of the 1st Amendment if one interprets it to mean no public official can exercise their faith in a courtroom, or a school or in the capitol building.\n\n \n There is a difference between the a public official and a central building that represents the entire government. No is arguing that the official or anyone cannot exercise their faith, just that the government cannot willfully favor one religion over another. Remember: the government is not one person. \n \n \nThe free expression of faith and the voluntary display of religous symbols or commandments on public property are not the object of our constitution in regards to what is or is not allowed.\n\n \n Certainly not the first one, but the second is more dubious. Religious symbols on public property are questionable. How per se is the government not favoring one religion by only letting one religion's symbol be displayed? Does that not set a precedent that the govenrment is favoring a specific religion by allowing or even condoning such a act? \n \n \nOnly existing laws and statutes passed by legislative bodies can be declared unconstitutional. The free, voluntary, uncoerced expression of faith and display of religious symbols cannot.\n\n \n Once again, you are linking voluntary expressions of faith and religious symbols as the same thing on state and federal property. That isn't true. One official can exercise his faith, but that is not representative of the entire goverment. When the govenrment places a single religion in its confins and excludes the rest, we have a problem. \n \n \n\n We should have no desire to shut down anybody's right to religious expression on public property under any pretext given our bill or rights because then I or you or anybody else will be next to be shut down.\n\n \n Okay, stop right there. The government is not a person. It has no religious rights. We are not argung about shuting down anyone's rights, nor are we saying that expressions of faith are wrong. We are discussing if it is allowable for the government to favor one religion over another. I don't care if you believe in ___ and say so. I care when the government starts putting up one religion's code of law without the rest. no matter what religion it is. \n \n \n\n This is not an emotional appeal to christians or conservatives. I'm not attempting to preach to the choir. \n\n \n But in the process, you do admit that it is a emotional appeal, which by all known means is a fallacy. \n \n \n\n Everybody has a stake in the outcome of these Supreme Court cases. It could set the bar at a certain level giving the government certain powers it should not possess to restrict rights it was duty bound to uphold and defend. \n \n\n \n How is the government restricting rights by putting up all religion's code of laws or no religion's code of law in their property?

In addition it has also kept both the secular government and the private religions stronger in the long run so it really is a win-win situation.\n\n \n Agreed, but you're facing a majority population of fundamentalist Christians who erroneously believe our government was intended to judge world morality based on their belief system. Now that our economy is declining we've switched from a position of abundant prosperity as motivation to fear and they're looking to their mythology as a comfort zone with an administration exploiting that fear.",

   "I interpret the first clause of the Constitution as an all or nothing clause. Either you allow all religions in equally without picking one above the other, or you refuse all religions EQUALLY without picking one above the other. If one starts affirming even something above something else, well then they reach that slippery slope, even the \"non offensive 'higher being'\" talk is still wrong because (1) it assumes a monotheistic and (2) often times Judeo-Christian world-view. Hindu's and Bhuddists believe in no such thing. Hindu's are polytheistic and Bhuddists are something completely different.\n \n I would not allow anything in because it is easier to do legally and it will cause less headache in the long run. In addition it has also kept both the secular government and the private religions stronger in the long run so it really is a win-win situation.\n\n \n A law that \"would not allow anything in because it is easier to do legally and it will cause less headache in the long run\" is prohibited by the 1st Amendment (congress shall make no law.. prohibiting the free exercise thereof).",
