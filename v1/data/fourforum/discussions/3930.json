SO what?\n\n <P<\n \n Reply to the above: \n \n Well hello! epaphras_faith, and how'are you'll doing on this blessed day?\n \n But have you considered: Thats if one is insterested to know in sharing these truths also: :) emoticon_idea \n \n Do we as Christians have the right to know! and follow! the whole truth! about the real birth of Jesus Christ? , or do we really want to know the truth that can make/set us free from man made traditions? , Well! , below is some views of the truth! , if interested! :\n \n In dealing with the issue of our Saviour's birth record, we could at least look at some facts, we also thank God for your views Titus 2:1 :\n \n 1. Since the couses! /an onward movement/a cycle of one week/1-7 days in counting. I Chronicles 24: 1-\"7-10\"-19. Genealogy/Priesthood order. were not dismissed II Chronicles 23:8- the Priest dismissed not the courses, I Chr. 24:1, I Chr. 25:1\n \n 2. As we read in the book of Luke 1: 5, we find that it was the course of Abia within the priest named Zacharias of his service was the 8th. course. I Chronicles 24: 10. Order or division. Luke 1: 5-19. The Angel Gabriel announces the birth of John the Baptist to the priest Zacharias at that time, which Could have been either the month Sivan/3rd. month of the Hebrew sacred calendar/May-June of the Roman/Julian/Gregorian calendar or the month of Chislev/9th. month of the Hebrew sacred calendar/November-December of the Roman/Julian/Gregorian calendar. (each priest served twice a year plus Holy Feast days).\n \n 3. So as stated above, if Zacharias was serving his course in the month of Sivan/May-June when the Angel Gabriel appeared to him, than John the Baptist would have been born in the month of Adar/February-March. Then 6 months later Jesus Christ of Nazareth/our LORD and Saviour was born, brings us to the month of Elul/August-September, as being His/Jesus Christ birth. Or:\n \n 4. Also as stated above, if Zacharias was serving his course in the month of Chislev/November-December when the Angel Gabriel appeared to him, than John the Baptist would have been born in the month of Elul/August-September. Then 6 months later Jesus Christ of Nazareth/our LORD and Saviour was born, brings us to the month of Adar/February-March, as being His/Jesus Christ birth. .....We Bro. Walter, Jr. and Sis.

   "Excuse me butting in here: but I think the Herod being referred to was Herod the Great second son of Antipater. This particular Herod died in 4BC (as trebor says).\n\n \n Thank you for the clarification.\n \n Now on to the next point. Why is it that it could not have happened prior 6AD. Judea was considered part of the Roman empire long before that date.\n \n Edit: Historical Reference. Judea was actually conquered by the romans decades before:\n \n There have been several military engagements between the Jews and the Romans: \n the Roman general Pompey subdued Judaea in 63 BCE (after which it became a client kingdom) \n in 6 CE, the emperor Augustus deposed king Archelaus, and his governor of Syria, Quirinius, established the province of Judaea (which became a prefecture) \n in 66, a serious rebellion started, which led to the destruction of the Temple (September 70); this war was described by Flavius Josephus in his Jewish War \n a little later, the Romans took the fortress Masada (in 74) \n in 115, the Levantine Jews revolted against emperor Trajan \n when the emperor Hadrian forbade circumcision, Simon bar Kochba started a Messianic war, which lasted until 136. It meant the end of the multiform Judaism of the first century. \n This is the second of seven documents, dealing with the establishment of the province Judaea.\n http://www.livius.org/ja-jn/jewish_wars/jwar02.html \n \n There is no reason that they would not have taken a census with Quirinius prior to the actual establishment of the province. The romans were still there and in charge. The establishment is an administrative function.\n \n ef",
