   "A little off topic, but when do we as a society draw the line between compassion and practicality. Ex, Person A is going to die sonner or later. Do we feed him medication, house him, use tax payers dollars to try and save a person from an already certin fate. Or do we send said person home to pass amungst caring and loving relatives and in thier own bed. It is easy to answer practially until it is not practical say when the person on that cusp is a relative. Personaly I watched my grand pa pass in a s h i t t y hospital bed surronded by people who did not genuinley love him. I told my self I would never let that happen. To be interruppeted every two hours for blood work, test medication and to what end. I think it is peoples own selfishness. ( not that my grandpa was selfish) I can not ask grand pa how he feels about this topic but I can gurantee the last thing he did not want to see before he died was some strung out underpayed nurse interruppting our final moments with him to take this test or eat this pill. If that was me I would have demanded to be sent home. Where I could have a beer and steak and watch the hockey game with those who truly cared for me. leaving said nurse and hospital bed open to sombody who has a fighting chance of survival. \n \n Paece Fisher",

   "Most of the last couple of centuries' increased life expectancy in the developed world can be related to improvements in sanitatation, hygiene, vaccination and antibiotics. Genetic manipulation would appear to offer the \"best\" chance of a further extension of lifespan in this century, but if that were not accompanied by a maintenace of good health in which to enjoy it, then an increase in lifespan would indeed be prolonging the agony.",
