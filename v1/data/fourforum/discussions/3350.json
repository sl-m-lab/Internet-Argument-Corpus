   "In the Sept. 17, 2004 issue of Science, in the \"Random Samples\" column \n there is a blurb about a paper that seems to be ruffling some feathers.\n \n http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol305/issue5691/r-samples.shtml#305/5691/1709b\n \n \n It was published in Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington. Nothing prestigious or anything, but still a peer-reviewed scientific journal. The article is not based on original research but is a review essay that draws conclusions from a synthesis of previous research. \n \n Here it is via the Discovery Institute:\n http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2177&program=CSC&callingPage=discoMainPage\n \n \nOn August 4th, 2004 an extensive review essay by Dr. Stephen C. Meyer, Director of Discovery Institute's Center for Science & Culture appeared in the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington (volume 117, no. 2, pp. 213-239). The Proceedings is a peer-reviewed biology journal published at the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.\n \n In the article, entitled \"The Origin of Biological Information and the Higher Taxonomic Categories\", Dr. Meyer argues that no current materialistic theory of evolution can account for the origin of the information necessary to build novel animal forms. He proposes intelligent design as an alternative explanation for the origin of biological information and the higher taxa. \n\n \n Does this article deserve to be published in a small, obscure biology journal?\n Is this an example of pseudo-science \"squeaking through\" the system?\n \n .",

   "I will add my own little opinion here. I just read the paper fully and it is total caca. I now see why the editors of the journal (what were they sleeping?) issued a statement saying something to the affect of \"if we had noticed, it wouldn't have been printed.\" It should be retracted if anything.\n \n For example:\n \nThe ease with which information theory applies to molecular biology has also created confusion about the location of information in organisms. Perhaps because the information carrying capacity of the gene could be so easily measured, it has been easy to treat DNA, RNA and proteins as the sole repositories of biological information. Neo-Darwinists in particular have assumed that the origination of biological form could be explained by recourse to processes of genetic variation and mutation alone (Levinton 1988:485). Yet if one understands organismal form as resulting from constraints on the possible arrangements of matter at many levels in the biological hierarchy--from genes and proteins to cell types and tissues to organs and body plans--then clearly biological organisms exhibit many levels of information-rich structure.\n \n Thus, we can pose a question, not only about the origin of genetic information, but also about the origin of the information necessary to generate form and structure at levels higher than that present in individual proteins. We must also ask about the origin of the \"specified complexity,\" as opposed to mere complexity, that characterizes the new genes, proteins, cell types and body plans that arose in the Cambrian explosion. Dembski (2002) has used the term \"complex specified information\" (CSI) as a synonym for \"specified complexity\" to help distinguish functional biological information from mere Shannon information--that is, specified complexity from mere complexity. This review will use this term as well.\n\n \n In this passage he is confusing our perception of information and our perception of order and complexity with something real. In the bolded sentence he asks \"How did structures arise that are larger than proteins?\" This is pretty stupid. The \"information\" he is looking for is in the properties of matter. He is basically asking a question (in a directing way) that is a current field of research: understanding how membranes form and replicate, fuse into vesicle-like structures and could have possibly become the containers genetic and metabolic material. Also, how did the three components necessary for life come together? Those are genes (some sort of \"information\" storage to provide for replication) metabolism (breaking-down of material for energy yield), and the compartment within which they are isolated, the cell (a membrane-bound vesicle).\n \n There are several theories (some mutually exclusive:)) that try to solve these problems. Some involve metabolisms developing on mineral surfaces (one of the most plausible scenarios). The processes could have come into conntact with some fatty amphiphiles (look it up) forming a lipid layer over it, which then protected the processes and could have even budded and formed some of the first primordial cells. Others involve RNA self-catalysis, where RNA (formed on mineral surfaces again) is the genetic part and the metabolic part (the \"RNA world\" approach). Anyway, lots of folks are working on these problems in attempts to explain how life could have arisen on earth from non-life.\n \n Why he jumps to conclusions about Intellegent Design is beyond me.\n \n .",
