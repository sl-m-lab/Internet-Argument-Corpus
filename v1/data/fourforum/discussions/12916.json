That JESUS said something is a WHOLLY different matter than you and I trying to be hypocrisy-cops.\n \n \nQuite frankly, we're actually back in the territory of people feeling remorse over their actions and striving to do better.\n Jesse Jackson was a hypocrite when he counseled Clinton on his infidelity, as Jackson himself was being unfaithful.

Look, stop the charade. Just be straight up and admit that what this is really about for you is getting to see a 'family values' guy with egg on his face. Because when someone takes ANY opportunity he can find to throw hypocrisy cases out there, and only does it for people on the other side an ideological aisle, it's no longer a form of objectivity. It would be different if people like yourself included statements that also admitted a lot of people make mistakes, even mistakes of HYPOCRISY.

The fact is, if you've EVER engaged in an hypocritical action, then you're a hypocrite for harping on it here. \n \n \nI think it's more accurate that you overuse it.\n You try to attach the label to others if they even try to recognize the hypocrisy that exists.\n\n \n Because people in the anti-hypocrisy fad don't seem to realize that harping on hypocrisy is often a form of hypocrisy in and of itself.",

Politicians lie. That is a fact. Politicians who bash their opponent on a behavior they themselves do are the worst. So you think that a politician who never ran on a platform of moral values who later betrays those moral values is identical to a politician who campaigned on his alleged superior moral values as to why he should be elected over the other guy who then later betrays those moral values? \n \n Is a candidate who's #1 campaign promise is to never raise taxes who then raises taxes the same as a candidate who never promised anything either way on taxes who then raises taxes? \n \n Knowing you, you won't answer hard questions.\n \n \nIn between your personal attacks and ad hominem, that is.

Wow.\n \n \nBut on the flip side, why are you pointing out hypocrisy in the first place?\n I though you abhorred that?\n\n \n Because I'm trying to balance this \"Republicans-are-the-hypocrites\" approach of this forum.\n \n \nAs it is, you're deriving a false assessment based on the fact that I typically don't do much discussion of politics on these boards.\n\n \n Hate to break it to ya, but the \"gay rights\" forum is largely a discussion of politics. Here, you are decidedly one-sided. If at least TRYING to look objective is important to you, maybe you should indeed post in other forums so you can be more independent in you stances.\n \n \nSo basically you're saying that only somebody who has PERFECTLY kept every single one of their standards can ever point out hypocrisy???\n\n \n Well, that's what you're expecting, isn't it, when you drudge up photo shoots from years ago?\n \n \nBy your approach, lying politicians cannot be criticized... emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n BLOWI.

   "So .... if a Republican espouses \"family values\", but doesn't accuse his opponent of NOT having family values, then you'd stop howling about it? Suddenly it would be fine with you?\n\n Don't do that. Lay off the hyperbole.\n Obviously violating one's marital vows would not be \"fine with me\". I sincerely hated what Clinton did, both in his infidelity and his lying about it.\n So no. It wouldn't be \"fine with me\".\n Furthermore, there is no real point for you to gain in that, cause obviously it would NOT be \"fine with you\" either.\n \n But to the bigger picture here, it would be the difference between driving down the highway going 100 MPH with heroin in the back-seat and a baby in the front not in a car-seat...\n ... and the same situation without the heroin.\n \n \n \nI also think that, considering how big of a deal you're making of it...\n\n Oh COME ON now Jyoshu.\n Get a grip here.\n HOW am I really \"making a big deal\" of it???\n Because I don't agree with your stance on \"hypocrisy\", arguing with you about \"hypocrisy\" on a message board, that means I am making Sanford a \"big deal\"???\n Stop for a minute and ask yourself HOW EXACTLY am I making Sanford's transgressions a \"big deal\"...\n \n \n \n... it would be a good idea for you to DEFINE specifically what you mean of \"family values\". Because you're throwing it around like a rag doll.\n\n emoticon_wow\n Wow dude. You are seriously looking at wasting my time, aren't you...\n \"Family Values\", as defined by the neo-con / religious right, include a nuclear family with one mother, one father, married. Opposition to adultery and divorce. Opposition to gay rights. Adoption over abortion. Children (and often adults) \"protected\" from viewing pornography and similar things.\n \n Man. I would really like to get a good reason for why you're asking that, but I'm not going to waste either of our times on that one...\n \n \n \nLike everyone is on the same page in terms of what that MEANS exactly, when you know well that they don't. Please define, specifically, what that phrase MEANS.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n Jyoshu, honestly we're in \"where the heck have you been? living under a rock?\" territory on that complaint.\n \n \n \nSo, as long as they don't try to do family values LEGISLATION, but HOLD to it and unabashedly TALK ABOUT IT, you'd be perfectly fine with it? Riiiiiiiiiiiiight ....... \n\n And here you go again. Pretending your skepticism and hyperbolic assumption of my position is somehow an argument. emoticon_frazzled\n It's not.\n \n Jyoshu, try to recognize reality here.\n I would think it safe to say that EVERYBODY here has a problem with Sanford's\n a) marital infidelity,\n b) lying about it.\n Okay? I shouldn't need to remind you of that, but evidently I do.\n \n Our discussion has branched off into talking about why \"hypocrisy\" is or is not an important thing.

As in, VERY recently.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n When did you want us to act?\n Six months ago when he just took office?\n Like I've reminded you on several occasions, he has had a LOT on his plate.\n The \"Great Recession\". Two wars. Failing car companies. Failing bank companies. Iran and North Korea going nuts.\n \n \n \n Now that he's indicated he might even support DOMA.\n\n Oh yeah. Snap!\n Gays should have criticized him for doing that BEFORE he even did it.\n That makes so much sense! \n emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nBut forget though that he has publicly come out AGAINST gay marriage. He got a pass on that.\n\n I've addressed this repeatedly in the past.\n Any politician who campaigns with \"yes to gay marriage\" is automatically hobbling himself out of the gate.\n Him doing that might very well have handed McCain the election.\n \n \n \nMeanwhile, when a Republican says they are against gay marriage, they are castigated as some dastardly \"family values\" person. (ooh, what a boogeyman!)\n\n Jyoshu, it is NOT JUST saying \"no to gay marriage\".\n The Republican politicians also say no to civil unions, gays in the military, ENDA, gay hate crime legislation, ...\n It's the WHOLE PACKAGE that make them the \"dastardly family values\" person.\n \n Either you're being willfully ignorant on that reality, or blatantly deceitful.\n \n \n \nWhat part of \"marriage is between a man and a woman\" do you not GET, Foundit? 'Cause such a statement has NADA to do with how busy he is with other issues.\n\n What part of my response to that, to date, has been unclear whereby you would ask me about supposedly not understanding that???\n I have clearly demonstrated that I DO understand he is against gay marriage in other threads, have I not?\n \n \n \nThat's because with Sanford, people aren't treating him like the second coming of a messiah. They aren't completely IGNORING his statements like they are with Obama.\n\n Does it hurt talking out of both sides of your mouth like that?\n You JUST GOT DONE ACKNOWLEDGING that gays are frustrated with Obama.\n And now you turn around and claim it's \"completely ignoring\"...\n \n Which is it?\n Gays are NOT giving him a pass, and you would do well to recognize that in the same post that you admitted that gays were having problems with Obama...\n 'mmkay?\n \n \n \nI just SAID the forum (which includes you) is one-sided.\n\n BLOWI. You said that IN ANOTHER SPOT, but your later on comment was aimed DIRECTLY AT ME\n To requote you: \"I have YET to see you admit your one-sidedness even though you very much ARE.\"\n \n Why would you challenge me to admit the board's one-sidedness?\n Where is the sense in pretending that \"the board\" should admit one-sidedness?\n \n Pshaw. This is going to be another of those accusations against me you refuse to substantiate, isn't it...\n \n \n \nYou want me to give specifics on what you're NOT doing?\n\n Yeah. You're in your mode of throwing out accusations, but proving nothing...\n The issue was your accusation of me being one-sided regarding inconsistency / hypocrisy.\n So obviously the \"specifics\" would be on what issues I have shown one-sided inconsistency/hypocrisy.\n \n \n \nI said you need to give examples from BOTH sides of the aisle if you want to be taken seriously as someone who champions non-hypocrisy so much.\n\n You seriously don't know what the word \"hypocrisy\" means, do you.\n If somebody has a bias, that is not the same thing as being hypocritical.\n \n \n \n\"Happily\"? I think this is the first time I've seen you post anything negative (yet accurate) about a high-profile Democrat. Wow.\n\n 1) Again, I really don't post that much on politics here.\n Of course getting you to admit that would be nigh impossible.\n 2) Quite frankly, how many \"high-profile democrats\" have you really seen me talk about in the first place?\n Nah. I don't expect an honest answer on that one either...\n \n \n \nBecause I'm trying to balance this \"Republicans-are-the-hypocrites\" approach of this forum.\n\n So if a white guy thinks too many black guys are speeding on the highway, you'd be like a white guy who starts driving too fast as well to make up for it... emoticon_xdonno\n Yeah. Makes perfect sense...\n \n \n \nHate to break it to ya, but the \"gay rights\" forum is largely a discussion of politics.\n\n Political philosophy on one specific issue? Sure.\n An issue to critique political parties on a big picture context? No.\n \n Democrats do gay rights better.

That should be clearly NOT what I am expecting.\n Secondly, I didn't \"drudge up\" those photos. I simply pointed out she lied on her application, after other people noted it.\n \n \n \nBLOWI. My view is that we shouldn't throw out forgiveness and acknowledging that people make mistakes just because someone is a politician\n\n Doesn't really address my point or comment, does it.\n Nobody is arguing against \"forgiveness\". But \"forgiveness\" typically comes from sincere remorse. Not lying, and then \"whoops! I got busted so I better out myself\" when he realizes the lie won't hold.\n \n But like I keep pointing out (and you keep cutting and pasting around), you yourself have repeatedly tried to make \"Democrats are not really pro-gay\" an issue in the past.\n So obviously it's not just an issue of \"mistakes\" and \"politicians\".\n \n \n \nLOL! Riiiiiiiighht....\n\n And once again, your refusal to accept another person's position is not an argument.\n Like I said, I typically don't talk about politics here. You REALLY should not assume my position...\n \n \n \nWhat's your statute of limitations for hypocrisy, Foundit? Because based on that, it would take a LOOOOONG time to get your forgiveness.\n\n Wow. You really don't listen, do you. Let me repeat...\n The point is that if a person had recognized there error, CORRECTED it and/or sought reconciliation out of remorse BEFORE they were busted, that would be a credit to them.\n Sanford came back AND LIED to the media.\n It got leaked that he was seen flying out of an airport, and THEN he came forward and did his \"heart-felt\" admission of guilt.\n \n \n \nIf he KNEW it was wrong, he's already met one of your requirements--that he realized the error of his ways.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Jyoshu? Do you understand the issue of the \"insanity defense\" when it comes to a legal defense?\n Part of it revolves around whether or not the person involved has the capacity to recognize that they did wrong. If they could recognize their actions as wrong and chose to do it anyways, that's typically legally culpable sanity.\n \n What you just recognized is that Sanford cannot pull off an \"insanity defense\" when it comes to recognizing his infidelity was wrong... emoticon_ic\n \n You are setting the bar WAYYYYY too low. Even a five year old stealing cookies from the cookie jar typically knows it's wrong.\n The SINCERITY OF REMORSE is the most important thing.\n \n \n \nI think that this largely comes down to some people being less forgiving than others.\n\n Yeah.

Your own movement is starting to leave you behind on this.\n \n \nAny politician who campaigns with \"yes to gay marriage\" is automatically hobbling himself out of the gate.\n Him doing that might very well have handed McCain the election.\n\n \n The interesting thing here is that you're giving him--a politician--the BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT of pro-gay intentions. The assumption that, although he said ONE thing, he was really thinking the opposite--he just couldn't SAY so because of the risk of political fallout. I find it FASCINATING that people like yourself treat him differently in this way than other politicians. For some reason you assume Obama's out for YOUR well-being rather than just doing whatever the winds of political advantage call for. In a sense, in this respect, you're of the same cloth as the sheeple in the REPUBLICAN party that blindly follow. Just on the different side of the aisle.\n \n \nWhat part of my response to that, to date, has been unclear whereby you would ask me about supposedly not understanding that??? I have clearly demonstrated that I DO understand he is against gay marriage in other threads, have I not?\n\n \n The point is that you seem to FORGIVE him for it. You basically give him a pass as compared to the way you treat Republicans for the issue. X Republican says marriage is between a man and a woman .... he's a monster for it. X Democrat says marriage is between a man and a woman ... but he's the messiah for gay people.\n \n I guess in large part it was just more of what lots of plenty of other groups did as well: buy into a politician's whole vague promise of \"change.\" Meanwhile, he was very careful not to be too specific. No one seemed to notice that, until now, when he's not living up to anyone's expectations.\n \n \nWhy would you challenge me to admit the board's one-sidedness?\n\n \n 'Cause frankly, you probably epitomize that one-sidedness the most.\n \n \n1) Again, I really don't post that much on politics here.\n \n Political philosophy on one specific issue? Sure.\n \n Democrats do gay rights better. Whether you want to admit that or not is irrelevant.\n\n \n If a group gave indication they were willing to support the idea of redefining marriage to accomodate polygamists, and give them marriage benefits, certainly polygamists would like that group better. Doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.\n \n \nFirst of all, no. That should be clearly NOT what I am expecting.\n Secondly, I didn't \"drudge up\" those photos.\n\n \n I guess I should have said you drudged up the STORY on the photos. The point remains the same, either way. It's a rather tabloid-sort-of thing to do. \n \n \nDoesn't really address my point or comment, does it.Nobody is arguing against \"forgiveness\". But \"forgiveness\" typically comes from sincere remorse. Not lying, and then \"whoops!

Even a five year old stealing cookies from the cookie jar typically knows it's wrong.\n The SINCERITY OF REMORSE is the most important thing.\n\n \n And again, what would constitute \"sincere remorse\" to you? What ACTIONS does Sanford need to take now to measure up to what you're requiring?\n \n Since you demand sincerity, shown what actions must be met for you to BE convinced of sincerity. You have a SERIOUS habit of complaining about something, and yet then keeping any personal requirements off the table that would alleviate the complaint. Effectively stomping your foot, saying 'demands should be met!' but never actually giving specific demands. Do you do this so you can keep on complaining about a given issue as long as possible--to get the most mileage out of it before having to reveal any actual SOLUTIONS? Is that why you like to avoid such specifics? \n \n And you keep making an issue that it was only after he was \"busted\" that he admitted it. I don't think I've EVER seen a politician admit something like that until after he was busted. Have you?? So by your standards, NO politician could ever be forgiven. This is unreasonable on your part. You say you're not against forgiveness, but then you set a standard for it high that no politician ever caught in such a scandal can be forgiven!\n \n \nPart of it revolves around whether or not the person involved has the capacity to recognize that they did wrong.

   "2) Quite frankly, how many \"high-profile democrats\" have you really seen me talk about in the first place?\n Nah. I don't expect an honest answer on that one either...\n\n And with absolutely no surprise, I was right.\n But ignoring that didn't stop Jyoshu from continuing his accusations in his follow-on post...\n \n \n \nYou haven't refuted anything about Obama here.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n This thread IS NOT ABOUT Obama.\n Do you want me to link you to the place I refuted you last time, just cause you're repeating your junk (which I already addressed) in a new thread?\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n No. Actually I think what you want is to have this thread move away from talking about \"family values\" proponents violating \"family values\".\n THAT is what you want.\n \n \n \nMore and more gay-rights editorials are appearing that refute YOU, as I've linked to in numerous cases now.\n\n \"gay-rights editorials\"?\n You were quoting a guy who thought of gay rights as \"advance social acceptance of gay people\". A clearly anti-gay rhetoric ideal.\n The guy obviously had no real interest in gay equality, and his piece was a \"bash Obama\" attempt. emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nI don't even need to point it out anymore. Your own movement is starting to leave you behind on this.\n\n I realize this may fall on deaf ears, but I have also stated frustrations with Obama.\n I also recognize some just plain b.s. excuses to attack.\n I agree with some criticism of Obama, whether you want to admit it or not...\n \n \n \nThe interesting thing here is that you're giving him--a politician--the BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT of pro-gay intentions.\n\n Sanford ACTIVELY VIOLATED \"family values\".\n You complain about \"benefit of the doubt\".\n \n To put this equally, we should be talking about attacking some \"family values\" supporter cause we THINK HE COULD violate family values...\n \n Once again, you're in apples and oranges land.\n \n \n \nThe assumption that, although he said ONE thing, he was really thinking the opposite--he just couldn't SAY so because of the risk of political fallout.\n\n I assumed no such thing.\n You need to learn to listen and stop trying to look for ways to pretend other people are saying things they are not.\n My point is that any politician who actively supports gay marriage could not get into office in 2008.\n I'm being pragmatic.\n \n \n \nI find it FASCINATING that people like yourself treat him differently in this way than other politicians.\n\n I find it fascinating you refuse to listen to the clear differences.\n If McCain had supported ENDA and hate crimes legislation and ending the gay military exclusion rule and talked of advancing civil unions, THEN and ONLY THEN would we have equal ground.\n \n \n \nFor some reason you assume Obama's out for YOUR well-being rather than just doing whatever the winds of political advantage call for.\n\n \"for some reason\"???\n ROFLMAO! You're funny.\n I've explained to you repeatedly the \"reasons\", and you drop the entire thread. Obama has shown himself as willing to go to the mat for gay rights IN SITUATIONS HE DOES NOT HAVE TO.\n He voted against DOMA.\n He has gone to black churches which oppose gay equality, and talked to them about gay equality.\n \n These are some of the \"some reasons\" I think what I think.\n \n \n \nThe point is that you seem to FORGIVE him for it.\n\n No. emoticon_xdonno\n Suppose Jack is late for picking Dana up for the movies. He has a problem with punctuality.\n Along comes jyoshu who never liked Jack in the first place. He starts railing about how Jack has never been good for Dana, and how he doesn't really like her, and how he doesn't have her best interests at heart.\n Dana recognizes Jack has some things he needs to fix in his life, but also recognizes that jyoshu has just plain left the rational building in his analysis of Jack...\n \n Jyoshu? Quite frankly lately you are responding to how you CLAIM my position is, avoiding what I ACTUALLY SAY on the subject.\n \n \n \nYou basically give him a pass as compared to the way you treat Republicans for the issue. X Republican says marriage is between a man and a woman .... he's a monster for it. X Democrat says marriage is between a man and a woman ... but he's the messiah for gay people.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n While Jack may be late for picking Dana up for dinner, the Republican husbands actively compare Dana to a child molestor and bestiophile in congress. The Republican husbands actively say that Dana should not be able to serve in the military, should not have her job protected, and should not have hate crimes legislation.\n Jack supports those things, although he's been busy at the office lately.\n \n You keep wanting to compare ONE MYOPIC ISSUE of Republican and Democrat, and it's ridiculously intellectually dishonest jyoshu.\n The reason I see differences extend BEYOND gay marriage, while you want to pretend it is JUST gay marriage we look at...\n \n \n \n'Cause frankly, you probably epitomize that one-sidedness the most.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Which brings me back to my original challenge, which you have been ducking...\n I challenged you to explain where I am one-sided / inconsistent / hypocritical.\n \n And you keep ducking that challenge, as you keep trying to repeat the accusation.\n Pathetic!\n \n \n \nDemocrats do gay rights better. Whether you want to admit that or not is irrelevant.\n\n \nIf a group gave indication they were willing to support the idea of redefining marriage to accomodate polygamists, and give them marriage benefits, certainly polygamists would like that group better. Doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Geezus Jyoshu. Do you ever listen to yourself?\n You just got finished explaining how Democrats and Republicans are essentially the same on gay marriage.\n \n I talk about Democrats doing gay rights better, and I EXPLICITLY EXPLAINED the long list of things that Democrats DO do that Republicans FIGHT AGAINST, and you ignore it with that lame response which TOTALLY IGNORES YOUR CLAIMS on the issue...\n \n Democrats do gay rights better. ENDA. Hate crimes legislation. Civil unions. Fighting DOMAs even, although the party is very split on that.\n In the states recently that enacted gay marriage, it was due to the Democrats in the state, as the Republicans fought it.\n So you want to know why Democrats are supported? You talk about it being \"some reason\"?\n I will tell you why gays support Democrats for gay rights.\n Cause they fight FOR them, and NOT AGAINST them as Republicans do.\n \n \n \nI guess I should have said you drudged up the STORY on the photos. The point remains the same, either way. It's a rather tabloid-sort-of thing to do.\n\n And I think denying gays equal rights out of interests in protecting \"a word\" is a pretty absurd \"sort-of thing to do\".\n \n Furthermore, I just have to laugh at the big picture here.\n You have repeatedly complained about those threads, and you CONTINUE TO BRING THEM UP where you can... emoticon_xdonno\n You're like the housewife who runs around saying \"I hate to spread rumors, but did you hear about the latest one that Debbie is telling?\"\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n It's funny how I have already explained the relevance to the GAY RIGHTS issue, above and beyond \"tabloids\", and you ignore it.\n But YOU bringing up \"tabloids\" for your perspective to be against \"gay pride\" is obviously fine and dandy for you...\n emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nAnd again, what would constitute \"sincere remorse\" to you? What ACTIONS does Sanford need to take now to measure up to what you're requiring?\n\n As previously quoted, Sanford has already laid out his requirements out on the table.\n He asked for Clinton to resign.\n Perhaps Sanford should live up to his expectations of others, and that would show \"sincere remorse\".\n \n Don't you think that if somebody says \"Punish him with X cause he did Y\", and then when he does Y he doesn't follow through with X, that shows hypocrisy and a lack of remorse?\n \n \n \nYou have a SERIOUS habit of complaining about something, and yet then keeping any personal requirements off the table that would alleviate the complaint. ....\n Is that why you like to avoid such specifics? \n\n You have a SERIOUS problem with making sudden requests for information, and then treating the FIRST request as somehow a major problem cause it hasn't been answered BEFORE YOU ASKED IT...\n It is stupid to complain I am avoiding something you JUST BROUGHT UP!\n \n \n \nAnd you keep making an issue that it was only after he was \"busted\" that he admitted it. I don't think I've EVER seen a politician admit something like that until after he was busted. Have you??\n\n And cockroaches hide in the dark and run from the light.\n Go figure!\n \n \n \nSo by your standards, NO politician could ever be forgiven.\n\n One of the reasons these posts grow is cause you keep on piling the strawman b.s.\n I never said anything about this guy NEVER being forgiven.\n \n \n \nSo .... if they DON'T realize they're wrong, someone who's cheated on his wife is guilty. Yet if they DO realize it's wrong, they're guilty. There's just no winning with you, huh??\n\n My gawd. At times you are just classically hilarious, cause you twist yourself into so many mental contortions with the obvious effort to criticize others that you don't even recognize how absurd you're being.\n \n We're talking about both situations with a HUSBAND HAVING AN AFFAIR ON A WIFE!!!!\n So yeah. I think that no matter how you look at that, the HUSBAND HAVING AN AFFAIR ON A WIFE is doing something bad.\n OMG! How could I EVER adhere to such a ridiculously strict standard that I think the bible itself would also agree to...\n Tell me Jyoshu. Would the bible have given the cheating husband a pass in either of those situations???\n \n \n \n'Course, you wouldn't be making NEARLY as big an issue of it if it were a politician that you weren't politically against.\n\n And you make this with absolutely no basis for your claim.\n Yet another unsubstantiated claim.\n FYI? When Clinton lied, I wanted him kicked out of office.\n Over time, I have come to realize that the standard would be such that it would effectively eliminate most politicians. I've tempered my view.\n But you have no basis for your claim, other than your typical b.s. of making claims of what people think just cause you think it sounds good for you to say... emoticon_wow",

   "emoticon_frazzled emoticon_angry\n The more details that come out on this situation, the more vile Sanford comes off...\n \n The following involves an interview WITH SANFORD'S WIFE...\n \n First, in a statement, she (Sanford's wife) let it be known that when she discovered the affair, she tried to work on the marriage. At the point where it was clear that wasn't working -- and \"I felt it was important to look my sons in the eyes and maintain my dignity\" -- she threw Sanford out.\n \n That's why, she explained, she didn't know where he was when the state -- and the nation -- was playing \"Where's Waldo?\" starring Mark Sanford. But she wasn't consumed with revenge, either.\n \n In fact, her written statement made it clear she still loved her errant husband and, remarkably, remained \"willing to forgive Mark completely for his indiscretions\" if he gets his act together.\n \n Then came the interviews -- in a car as she left her house, or in a brief sit-down with The Associated Press. That was where we learned this almost unbelievable tidbit: that the lovesick governor had repeatedly asked her permission to visit his mistress. (Can we presume to try to break it off?) This needs to be stated again: He asked his wife for permission to visit his lover. As if he expected his wife to say, \"Sure, honey, go right ahead\"?\n \n She didn't. As she told the AP, \"It's one thing to forgive adultery; it's another thing to condone it.\" So he went anyway, as Jenny Sanford tells us. She has no idea whether he has ended the affair, as he had promised. \"I believe he has,\" she said. \"But he was down there for five days. I saw him yesterday, and he is not staying here.\"\n \n As for the governor, he's too preoccupied with his own personal journey as a vulnerable, emotionally wrought male to actually tell the full truth about what happened. Apologies abound, but the fact that he has decided to try to remain as governor makes the truth harder to spill. Instead of seeing himself as a philanderer, he has now decided to cast himself more grandly -- as David in the ultimate battle of his political life.\n \n Jenny Sanford hasn't chosen a literary allusion to define her predicament. She prefers to see herself as she truly is: the mother of four sons, just trying to survive this mess with some dignity and honesty.\n\n Borger: Jenny Sanford becomes the new political paradigm - CNN.com\n \n The wife found out about it, and sought to try to fix the marriage.\n Sanford evidently didn't help... emoticon_wow\n \n He asks his wife for permission to go see his mistress???\n Even if we were to believe he wanted to go down there to end it, why would you need to see her for five days in order to end it?\n First of all, why would it take five days?\n Secondly, he has a commitment to his wife. The very fact that he felt he had to go see her face to face (for five days) demonstrates it was not just a casual fling, and that Sanford DID not regard his marriage very highly after his wife said \"No\".\n \n And now, instead of talking to his wife (she has no idea if the affair is truly over), he is working on salvaging his political image.\n Wow!\n \n \"Family Values\" in deed!",

Who do you think you're fooling with this schtick, anyway? The guy committed adultery. He's been part of no legislation regarding adultery, that I am aware of.

It's not an issue of whether values EXIST, but to what extent they are followed. Let's say Person A holds to the view that intentionally trying to dig up and post personal information about someone and his family is wrong. Yet then Person A goes and participates in that very thing. Does that speak to the merits of the VALUE, or of the person who did it? It just means that person ABANDONED their value in that case. When someone doesn't live up to a \"family value\", they've ABANDONED a family value. What you just did is like saying gay pride is \"anything but\" if someone tries to start living like a straight person again. No, that just means they've abandoned pride in being a gay person.",

   "It's funny how none of these people that conservative-haters try to associate with \"family values\" are known for their family values, or ESPOUSING them, to begin with.\n \n It would be one thing to have found out that, say, James Dobson had a affair. (He didn't; I'm just making a point.) It's another thing altogether to find out someone who's conservative--which is the movement the family-values movement is a part of--had an affair. \n \n I suspect a lot of 'family-values' people outside of his state weren't even very familiar with Sanford in terms of association with the \"family values\" movement (whatever that is, anyway).

The lesson learned here is NOT that family values are bad. The lesson learned here is to not be hypocritical. If anything, it only shows it's that much MORE important to have family values seeing the effects (on his family) of this guy NOT having them. Thank you, Gov. Sanford, for reminding us the importance of family values by showing people what NOT to do.\n \n At any rate, it's fascinating to see people like Foundit keep beating this horse over and over.

Not real family values.\n One of the funny parts of arguing with you is that you insist on arguing against the inanely obvious. You ask questions trying to denigrate the obvious observation, pretending you're making a point.\n \n And then every once in a while, you shine forth with a statement (totally oblivious) agreeing with something you had previously railed against, and you think you have proven something for your side... \n \n I remember a variety of threads (including this one) where you have tried to argue that the \"anti-gay\" focus was not their only focus, and there was no meaning in showing their virtually exclusive anti-gay focus as they have no real concern for MORE OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT \"family values\"...\n And here you try to derive importance FROM that distinction I have argued for so repeatedly in the past... :xbanghead\n \n \n \nNewsflash, Foundit: Sanford didn't have a GAY affair.\n Nor did he have a GAY marriage on the side. \n\n No. He didn't.\n He also didn't rape or kill anybody either.\n He also evidently didn't child molest an entire school district.\n He hasn't planted weapons of mass destruction at an airport.\n \n Now that we have finished talking about some of the things Sanford has not done, can we talk about what he HAS done?\n \n \n \nLet's review what has happened here, shall we ...\n\n Translation: Jyoshu is about to talk about NOTHING MAJOR that I have pointed out, and harp on problems he has with my statements.. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n- Foundit used the 'enforcing' and 'legislation' monikers to specify (at least to the extent I've been able to get you to actually BE specific) the way you view the family-values movement. IOW, their 'legislation' seems to be what makes it BAD, to him, for the most part anyway.\n\n Actually, I don't recall talking about it being a distinction of \"making it bad for me\" at all.\n Please. Quote me.\n \n I used it to explain the distinction that the family values groups themselves make. That Republican family values politicians use to try to separate themselves from other people (hint: Democrats) who also believe in families, but the Republicans hold themselves as being THE \"family values\" party...\n \n THAT is what I did...\n \n \n \n- But then it's pointed out to him that Sanford didn't PUSH for legislation about the sin he committed.\n - So then he changes by challenging others to point out what NON-gay rights legislation has been pushed for, which is precisely THE POINT. There's not, and obviously Foundit realizes the problems with his approach here.\n\n :xbanghead \n Jyoshu, part of the real point is that the \"family values\" crew often do not support real family values.\n Like keeping a family together and against adultery.\n \n They proclaim to stand up for your biblical beliefs on family, but evidently it's just REALLY about their biblical prejudice against gays.\n \n And this is a \"problem\"? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n I have to inwardly chuckle. I have wasted so much time trying to get you to admit their anti-gay focus, to the extent that they ignore bigger issues like adultery, divorce, single parents, etc, etc...\n And here, you epitomize that situation, and think it's my problem... \n \n \n \nFoundit, you don't get to just throw out this nebulous, vague phrase of \"family values\" ...\n\n My gawd man.\n Do you ever STOP AND THINK.\n I didn't create that phrase \"family values\".\n The REPUBLICANS did.\n The ANTI-GAY proponents did.\n \n If you want to complain about it being \"vague\" and \"nebulous\", TALK TO THEM.\n I am simply a guy repeating the SAME PHRASE THAT THEY made popular.\n \n And I agree completely that it is \"vague\" and \"nebulous\".\n It is obviously NOT APPLIED TO REAL issues of \"family values\" that AFFECT REAL FAMILIES. That actually HARM REAL FAMILIES.\n \n \n \n...and throw it up in peoples' faces when we're talking about UNRELATED issues.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Again. We're back to \"adultery\" (and probably leading to divorce) is \"UNRELATED\" to \"Family Values\"...\n This is part of the contradiction and absurdity that the RIGHT-WING is bringing us!\n \n And you see nothing wrong with this... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nBut Foundit, why are YOU engaging in an attacking-the-messenger solution if you don't like that?\n\n What the heck are you talking about?\n Be specific.\n \n Like I said, I will note the BIAS of a source, but I don't use that bias as a reason to REFUSE TO ADDRESS the comments of that source.\n To assume that their comments were wrong, just cause they have a bias.\n \n So please.

Just ignoring the problem is part of the reason we are at a 50% divorce rate in the first place.\n Just ignoring the problem is part of the reason we have a Congress that is so messed up in the first place.\n \n Sanford needs to have a \"come to Jesus\" moment where he realizes that he should work on what is more important.

IN THE SAME POST!\n I knew you would turn around and try to pretend that the fact that they fixate on \"family values\", but only talk about gays is just an absurd observation, but I seriously didn't think you would start that push IN THE SAME POST!\n \n This man claims to stand for \"family values\".\n The reason it is \"vague and nebulous\" is because people like you refuse to hold the people who use it as vague and nebulous accountable.\n People like you try to obfuscate their one sided fixation, as MORE OBVIOUS issues that actively tear families apart are ignored.\n \n Me personally?\n I think the solution is to make people like Sanford (and the 'family values' crowd around him) to MAKE the words mean something.\n \n The first gay married couple in Massachusetts get divorced, and the \"family values\" crew repeats it like crazy. Pointing to it like it's some sort of significant indicator of something.\n Sanford (a family values supporter) pulls this junk, and \"family values\" crowd ignores it...\n And you obfuscate for the issue by talking about a \"realm of values\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nIt's not an issue of whether values EXIST, but to what extent they are followed.\n\n And to what extent did Sanford follow \"family values\" when he ignored his wife's request that he not go see his mistress, he flies down to her for five days including Father's Day weekend, and he comes back and his wife still has no idea if he really broke up with her.\n \n To what extent is Sanford following \"family values\" jyoshu? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nLet's say Person A holds to the view that intentionally trying to dig up and post personal information about someone and his family is wrong.

   "(AP) South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford shed his fiscal conservatism on several taxpayer-funded international trips, including a South American jaunt that included time with his mistress, choosing expensive first-class or business-class seats while his aides sat in coach.\n \n Sanford, who once criticized other state officials for costly travel, charged the state more than $37,600 for one first-class and four business-class flights overseas since November 2005, expense records show. Other state employees flew in the back of the plane at a fraction of the price, according to the documents.\n \n The Republican governor, who balked at taking federal stimulus money after arguing it was an unwise use of taxpayer funds, charged the state $8,687 for a Delta Airlines trip to Brazil last year that included a leg in business class, state expense records show.\n \n That trip ended with the governor's now well-publicized visit to his Argentine mistress, Maria Belen Chapur, and marked what he says was the start of a nearly year-long sexual affair with the woman he's called his \"soul mate.\"\n \n Other state employees spent less than $2,000 each on economy seats for the Brazil flight, according to the records, released by two state agencies under South Carolina's Freedom of Information Act.\n \n Sanford has since repaid $3,300 for part of that Brazil-Argentina trip.\n \n His spokesman defended the governor's state travel as \"very judicious.\"\n \n \"He compares very favorably with previous administrations on use of the state plane, and we believe he would compare favorably on his use of other state travel as well,\" spokesman Joel Sawyer said.\n \n But Sanford's habit of more costly travel at the taxpayers' expense contradicts his claim of frugality. When first running for governor in 2002, the former congressman, who once boasted of sleeping on a cot in his office to save money, blasted incumbent state officials for their expensive flights.\n \n \"This kind of lavish spending with taxpayers footing the bill just doesn't make any sense to me,\" Sanford said in one campaign ad. \"If I become your governor, I'll fix that problem.\"\n \n State Senate Minority Leader John Land recalls the criticism that candidate Sanford heaped on others.\n \n \"I reckon he's a hypocrite,\" the Democrat said. \"He goes before the Christian right and professes to be one thing and yet his conduct is something else. He goes before the people of the state and talks about his fiscal conservatism. But yet when you see him in action, he's going first class and spending the state taxpayers' money.\"\n \n In interviews earlier this month with The Associated Press, the governor said he paid his own way when visiting his mistress during a New York rendezvous last September.\n \n Asked if he flew coach, Sanford was quick to point out his personal thrifty side. \"Yeah. You remember, I am paying,\" he said with a laugh.\n \n State travel records for Sanford, who took office in January 2003, are available only back to the fall of 2005, and the documents show a persistent pattern of expensive state travel.\n \n For example, he charged taxpayers $12,172 for travel to China in 2007, which included business-class accommodations on United Airlines, complete with upgraded food, drinks and an oversized reclining chair. \n\n Probe: Gov. Sanford Flew in Style - CBS News\n \n Sanford would give \"the boy who cried wolf\" a run for his money... emoticon_rolleyes",

   "By ERIK SCHELZIG,\n Associated Press\n Mon Aug 3, 4:30 pm ET\n \n NASHVILLE, Tenn. - The Tennessee state senator said he was opposed to sex outside marriage, but his private life told a different story: He was having an affair with his 22-year-old intern.\n \n When an extortion plot exposed married Republican Sen. Paul Stanley's illicit relationship, he said he would be \"clearing up\" misimpressions later. He's now clearing out his office, the latest politician caught in a sex scandal, this one made worse by not coming clean.\n \n \"If you can't explain what you've done to your constituents in 30 seconds or less in a way they would accept, then don't do it,\" said Bruce Oppenheimer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University. \"It's amazing how many elected officials violate that very important conventional wisdom.\"\n \n As news of the affair broke last month, the 47-year-old Stanley dodged reporters and issued a statement calling himself a victim. The suburban Memphis lawmaker, a married father of two who taught Sunday school, said he wanted to set the record straight. But, he insisted, prosecutors had told him not to talk.\n \n \n Tenn. senator has affair with intern, resigns - Yahoo! News",
