   "genesis indicates that god created the world in 6 days, and rested on the 7th, a precident that would establish this unit of time from then on. in like fashion, the jews followed this tradition, observing the sabbath as the 7th day of the week. sunday was viewed as the first day of the week, monday as the second, and so on. besides the sabbath, there is no indication that these days were specifically named, but rather were just identified by their number.\n \n of course, if the world was created as described in the bible, then the 7-day week would be a universal standard, established by adam and observed by all his offspring\n \n history shows us that this is not the case. besides the fact that there were many cultures that did not follow a 7 day week (there were 5, 6, 8 and 10 day weeks in various parts of the world), theres another origin of the 7 day week. \n \n \nFor a long time in human history, people thought that our Earth was flat, and at the universe's center. They believed that all celestial objects circled around us. \n \n Some Mediterranian peoples also believed that each hour of the day was ruled by either the Sun, Moon or one of five then-known planets. The sequence in which they thought hours were governed was the inverse order of distance they perceived these objects to be from Earth. \n \n During this time, Egyptians thought that the most distant (using English names) was Saturn, then closer were Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and closest, the Moon. So they believed that the first hour was ruled by Saturn, the second by Jupiter and so on. \n \n They thought that after each seven hours the order in which these objects were to be worshiped was repeated, and was started again with Saturn. \n \n According to ancient Egyptians, the planet that ruled the first hour also governed the entire twenty-four hour period, and gave its name to that day. The first (and also the 8th, 15th and 22nd) hours of the first day were sacred to Saturn, the 23rd to Jupiter, the 24th to Mars and the first hour of the next day to the Sun. Therefore, they believed that the first day was ruled by and named after Saturn and the second was ruled by and named after the Sun. \n\n http://www.highdown.reading.sch.uk/highdown/pupil/time/calendars/origin.html\n \n so did the week established by god and israel predate the planetary week? is it just a coincidence that people independently created a 7 day week that we use today separate from the week the jews observed? or perhaps the jews originated the week first, and other cultures adapt it into their own belief system?",

   "[makes stuff up]\n \n Well, in the bible, the tower of Babel clearly happened prior to the rise of the egyptian kingdom. Has to be because after this event, people spoke different languages and didn't cooperate anymore.\n \n And Babel happened long after God creating the universe and a 7 day week.\n \n What happened is that After this scattering of peoples by the Lord, some remembered the tru history of events and incorporated parts of it into their own beliefs and others forgot and being so demonically corrupted, invented anti-Godly systems for time and stuff.\n \n So, it's no real wonder that it would appear that some civilizations from the 4 CORNERS of the world remembered and others forgot.\n \n This is supported by a firm belief in the bible and using expi...expet...erm, made up stories to further explain it all.\n \n See, you can't believe anything that would contradict the bible and Gods holy Word. You could go to hell for that.\n \n \n \n And may Jesus bless you you heathen cause I surely won't!",

   "Time as measured on earth is subsequent to our position in the Solar System, and God's determination throughout the World is subsequent to it's culture. The 7 day week only refers to our mordern global aspect on the day, month, year cycle. If Religon focuses on a higher being and that higher being resides in the heavens in which the heavens pertain to the outer realms of our galaxies as well as even the Universe, 7 days may mean in \"God's\" terms 7 million earth years. After all, most texts regarding the different Religons are written through the voice of their Creator/'s. However, we as humankind attached a sort of false personification to \"God\" that in our physical reality could never understand. Instead, the very \"God\" that exists in all of us is consiquently Humanity in it's spiritual binding. Therefore, \"God\" is neither creator nor destroyer only an influence upon where Humanity proceeds. Science is given to us to gain knowledge and sustain our vast existance. Faith is given to us to overcome our own demons. So frankly, Humanity hasn't the Time to be seperated on the petty differences of faith. We must rely on a much more Universal aspect of time.",
