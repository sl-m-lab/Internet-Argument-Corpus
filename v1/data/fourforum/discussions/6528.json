Time staff writer John Cloud says the conservatives are targeting the youth \"to combat this\" phenomenon.\n \n Gay activists, meanwhile, are scrambling to reach these teens. Publications targeting gay kids are cropping up on the Internet and are available by subscription.\n \n Cloud also reports gay-straight alliance groups are forming rapidly on school campuses. He says there are clubs for gay and gay-friendly kids in nearly one in ten high schools in the U-S.\n _______________________________\n \n Exactly what do they mean \"Combating\" this. Do they want the kids to stay on the closet longer? Do they think they can somehow stop them from being gay? What does this mean?",
