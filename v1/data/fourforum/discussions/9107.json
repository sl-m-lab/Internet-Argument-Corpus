Sharp, 32 Cal.2d 711, 728 (1948), or when, nineteen years later, the United States Supreme Court also held that a statutory bar to interracial marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967). [FN16] As both Perez and Loving make clear, the right to marry means little if it does not include the right to marry the person of one's choice, subject to appropriate government restrictions in the interests of public health, safety, and welfare. See Perez v. Sharp, supra at 717 (\"the essence of the right to marry is freedom to join in marriage with the person of one's choice\"). See also Loving v. Virginia, supra at 12. In this case, as in Perez and Loving, a statute deprives individuals of access to an institution of fundamental legal, personal, and social significance-the institution of marriage-because of a single trait: skin color in Perez and Loving, sexual orientation here. As it did in Perez and Loving, history must yield to a more fully developed understanding of the invidious quality of the discrimination. [FN17]\n\n http://www.msnbc.com/news/995055.asp?cp1=1",

However you will conceed that if the gay couple does not like the law or requirement the have the right to demonstrate and protest.\n\n \n I have never suggested that a person does not have the right to protest about a law they don't like. I have only suggested that they shouldn't protest on the grounds that a law restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples is unconstitutional - because they are not. Whether such laws should be changed is a debate suitable for the public arena where the majority of people get to decide what is best. Dang, that democracy thing keeps creeping in.\n \n \nSince when do they not get to choose? Yes this is about the freedom to choose. You want to explain how the vast majority of heterosexuals do not get to choose who they marry without using the incest arguement?\n\n \n Without using the incest argument? Let's see, oh yes, they cannot marry a three-year-old or more than one person at a time no matter how badly they wish to. The incest argument works as well. Also, they have to marry a person of the opposite sex. This is a restriction on choice. If you're point is that marriage laws are unconstitutional because they let heterosexual people choose who they want to marry but not homosexual people, then you would be wrong. The same restrictions on choice for marriage apply to both homosexuals and heterosexuals. \n \n \n \nYes that would be correct. Neither does it mention marriage at all for any one. However gay people are intitled to equal protection under the law. Denying marriage to gay people, one class, while extending it to heteros, another class, is not equal protection.\n\n \n They are given equal protection - everyone has to follow the same criteria in order to be married. The rules apply to everyone. That is equal protection.\n \n \nCan you say catch 22 and circular reasoning.\n\n \n It's called an analogy.",

   "We base our laws off of Canada's religious freedom laws? Thats kinda lame. Anyway, \"religious freedom\" is probably the worst argument you make on a constitutional basis...well 2nd worse, the 9th amendment one is the worst.\n\n \n Sorry, I made a mistake. I was thinking of the shared common law definition of marriage used by the U.S. and Canada. The judges spoke of the law as evolving.\n \n \n\"We face a problem similar to one that recently confronted the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the highest court of that Canadian province, when it considered the constitutionality of the same-sex marriage ban under Canada's Federal Constitution, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter). See Halpern v. Toronto (City), 172 O.A.C. 276 (2003). Canada, like the United States, adopted the common law of England that civil marriage is \"the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others.\" Id. at, quoting Hyde v. Hyde, [1861-1873] All E.R. 175 (1866). In holding that the limitation of civil marriage to opposite- sex couples violated the Charter, the Court of Appeal refined the common-law meaning of marriage. We concur with this remedy, which is entirely consonant with established principles of jurisprudence empowering a court to refine a common-law principle in light of evolving constitutional standards. See Powers v. Wilkinson, 399 Mass. 650, 661-662 (1987) (reforming the common-law rule of construction of \"issue\"); Lewis v. Lewis, 370 Mass. 619, 629 (1976) (abolishing common-law rule of certain interspousal immunity). We construe civil marriage to mean the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others.\"\n\n \n http://www.samesexmarriage.ca/advocacy/massachusetts.htm\n \n \nOh how the tables turn?\n\n \n How do you figure I have turned the tables? \n \n \nWhen people say \"homosexuality is an illness\" you get all up in arms...now you call pedophilia an illiness.\n\n \n I have always called pedophilia an illness, or a disorder, or morally wrong. I have never accepted that any of that applies to homosexuality. This is regardless of what others may think of either homosexuality or pedophilia, which are two entirely separate things.\n \n \nOnce again it is clear you support restrictions on marriage, just different restrictions than I do....all of which are constitutional (or rather don't violate it).\n\n \n The issue are the restrictions that ban gay marriage. Opponents of gay marriage bring up other issues. Simply argue that gay marriage should remain banned and should never(or not at this time) be considered to be legalized.",

Let's not analyze the supposed analogy to see if it really is analagous. Wouldn't want to examine an argument or you might expose its flaws.",

   "gaetano, I think I've reconstructed everything right. If I missed anything, please post it again using the quote feature correctly.\n \n \n\n Not so long ago the definition of marriage was between a man and a woman of the same race. When racial discrimination became illegal and unacceptable so did prohibition of interracial marriage laws. Now we have discrimination based on sexual orientation keeping gay people from being legally wed. Discrimination based on ignorance and/or religious beliefs is on it's last legs. \n\n \n What's your point?\n \n \n\"That's nice. Convince a legislature.\" It's quite clear that you are comfortable with gay people not being entitled to the same thing that you are. Law abiding, tax paying citizens are being excluded from a public institution because they fail to meet the criteria that permits legal acknowledgement of marriage. However it is perfectly legal for a lesbian and and a gay man to get married. You wouldn't be able to call it anything but gay marriage since both parties are completely gay. My point being that as long as the particpants create the illusion of what many consider to be a \"normal\" marriage then these two gay people and their gay marriage are suddenly legal and legitimate. I suppose marriage can be gay, as long as it doesn't look gay.\n\n \n So you are saying that homosexuals are not denied the right to marry so long as the meet the criteria that everyone else has to? Interesting.\n \n \n\n You are right, it's about discrimination based on sexual orientation\n\n \n Wrong. As you pointed out above, homosexuals are allowed to marry so long as they meet the criteria that everyone else has to.\n \n \n\n Then I would hope that the constitution would at least guarantee that a person could marry a person who was not their choice.\n\n \n What does this even mean? The Constitution really has nothing to say about marriage AT ALL.\n \n \n\n For gay people it is discrimnation based on their sexuality. A murderer is a convicted felon and a menace to society and most likely an inmate of a correctional facility who has already been stripped of his liberty and wouldn't be able to use any type of law to evade punishment. Now back to reality, since the gay people involved in this issue have not committed any crimes, they should not be denied that which is granted to those who happen to be heterosexual.\n\n \n This does not make sense. If Equal Protection means no discrimination, then my example is correct. The fact that you recognize a difference in discrimination against felons and discrimination against law abiding citizens shows that you do not believe the Equal Protection clause forbids all discrimination. Now that we have arrived at this conclusion, it must be shown that the EP clause was meant to forbid discrimination against anything besides race.",

   "No, not ironic at all. The key idea there is that it is an argument for gay marriage. That is the equality gay marriage proponents are seeking. Yes, that is where equality stops for those arguing specifically for gay marriage. Why do you not deal with the issue? Do you have an argument which is not merely a diversion?\n then don't claim you are for equality when you are not. You are for equality up to a certain point. If thats your argument then you can't fault me for saying my position is equal. \n \n ha, irony is fun.\n \n \n\n He was arguing for racial equality I believe, if he did not insist that another racial group would have have to stay at the back of the bus. The gay rights movement is not arguing for total sexual equality including illegal and exploitative acts(and impossible nonsense about toddlers marrying one another) which by the way, have no more in common with homosexuality than they have with heterosexuality and straight rights.\nThen stop using the equality argument because you are not for that. You support restrictions, just different ones. You don't think restrictions are unconstitutional so don't make the argument that one restriction is going to be. Stop using \"Loving v. Virginia\" as a reason when keep saying that you aren't arguing on the basis of anything but homosexuals being able to marry (not race). \n \n Sigh, be consistent with your arguments.",
