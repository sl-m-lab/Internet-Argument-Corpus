   "Alrighty then. Buffalo's stupidity in the 24-23 loss to the Fish was heartbreaking, to say the least. But not surprising with the ineptitude from the coaching staff and the front office.\n \n ANYWAYS!!!!\n \n Your picks for 12/12/05\n \n Buffalo against the Pats at the Ralph?\n \n NE 25-Buffalo 19",

   "The Bears play the Steelers in Pittsburgh today.\n \n Steeler QB Rothenburger, or whatever his name is slow moving and likes to take a deep dropback to pass. Look for him to spend more time on his back than a $10 hooker today. The Bears defense is awesome.\n \n The Bears do have a bit of a QB controversy though. The rookie Orton only passed for 68 yards last week and the original injured starter, Rex Grossman, appears to be ready to play. If Orton has a bad first half he'll likely be replaced.\n \n The Steelers have lost three games in a row, today will be number four.\n \n Bears 28 Steelers 10",
