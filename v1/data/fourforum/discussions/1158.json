   "If any of you have been following the case in FL, you might have just seen the ultimate governmental intrusion into private right to die issues. A Florida woman has been lying in a hospice bed for 13 years, with no useful brain function in a permanent and non-reversible vegitative state. Her spouse states that she would not want to be kept alive artificially. Despite his attempts to allow her to die peacefully, the womans parents have been waging a campaign to keep her alive. She is continuously fed through a feeding tube, without which she would not live. In a short-lived victory, a court ruled that the husband had the right to have the feeding tube withdrawn. However, the womans parents and others have pleaded to anyone who would listen, and the Florida legislation stepped in and gave the Governor power to re-insert the feeding tube. The Governor promptly had the tube re-inserted, and the womans meaningless existence continues. The questions this brings to me are:\n 1. did the government overstep it's bounds?(is this constitutional)\n 2. should the governor be allowed to have such powers?\n 3. who legally has Power of Attorney? (parents, husband, or government)\n 4. if no documented power of attorney exists, who should be granted POA? (husband or parents)",

   "Okay I&#8217;ll put my two cents worth in. I lean towards libertarian in social issues so you can probably guess where I&#8217;m going to fall in this debate.\n \n 1. did the government overstep it's bounds?(is this constitutional)\n \n The courts may decide that answer. But if so, I hope they decide it&#8217;s unconstitutional.\n \n 2. should the governor be allowed to have such powers?\n \n My vote is no.\n 3. who legally has Power of Attorney? (parents, husband, or government)\n \n Don&#8217;t know that answer.\n \n 4. if no documented power of attorney exists, who should be granted POA? (husband or parents)\n \n My vote is husband. On a side note, if I thought pictures of me in that condition were going to be displayed all over national television, I would come back and haunt my parents or whoever did it.\n \n My wife and I both agree that we would not want to live under those conditions. Both of us love our families enough that we wouldn&#8217;t want to be that kind of burden. There is a difference between being alive and living. What mystifies me is that conservative Christians have taken up this cause as if it was personal to them. You would think that if someone professes to believe that the next life is so much better than this one, they would rejoice at seeing someone released from this kind of existence into a life with God.",

   "I wanted to vote in your poll but you left out one. I would vote that only God, gets to decide. For someone on life support, that cannot advocate for themselves and did not do so in advance, I think I would like to see the family go through mediation, and then perhaps if there was a dispute the court could settle who has authority but not make the decision.",

The court stated that the husband should have the right to decide, but the state legislature then stepped in and gave Gov. Bush the right to decide and negate the husbands wishes. The husband had already decided that she should be allowed to die, that her feeding tube should be removed. The major problem here is the governments involvement in a private issue. I think if Gov. Bush is going to act as her power of attorney and make decisions on her behalf, he should be willing to take on all responsibility for everything else that happens to this woman. He should now be responsible for her medical bills, her treatment and care decisions, and all other life issues. Of coarse he is not going to do this. Gov. Bush and the Fl legislature have taken a dangerous step down a slippery slope.",

   "if i were in a comatose i would prepare myself to end my life but who has the authority is what really matters i mean you could have a spouse and he/she maybe after your money if you're dead but if you choose the ones closest to you they would know what to do with you even if they don't do it correctly the way you planned it to be, they would still be doing it the right way because doing what is right and doing what you think is right are preety damn confusing. most of us has the same thinking as for saying when to let a person die but some of us aren't ready to except, some of us are willing to believe that anything could be possible in life of a comatose so they may leave him/her in the comatose situation for a long time without realizing that his/her life is like a nightmare everyday. therefore if you aren't living, walking, understanding, relating, or communicating, you are dead as you'll ever be in this life time anyway. maybe you'll reincarnate and you'll have a nice and enjoyable life if you have done some good deeds in your life.",

   "Interesting comments. My first question is, why is it a 'slippery slope' for an elected official to over-rule a legal decision? I personally would be far more concerned if an unelected judge over-ruled an executive decision. Also, it wasn't just because Gov. Bush didn't like the decision - \n \n \"Pro-life groups also worked hard to tell their constituents about Schiavo's plight, and they got active. In fact, so many calls went into Florida's legislative offices that the phone lines were shut down. \" (www.family.org)\n (over 100,000 Pro-Life comments were recieved)\n \n She's not in a coma. According to www.family.org, she is able to respond to others:\n \n \n \"I just don't know why it took so long for the Florida Legislature to act,\" Dobson said. \"I mean, this is an absolutely unbelievable situation . . . where a woman who's not in a coma - she's not on a respirator, she can relate to her mother and those around her, she can even say some words - (was) being starved to death, deprived of water (and food). That's unconscionable.\" \n \n While some criticized the Legislature, saying it was overriding Schiavo's wishes, Dobson strongly disagreed. \n \n \"Terri has not expressed her desire to be starved to death and deprived of hydration,\" the best-selling author and former University of Southern California clinical psychologist said. \"It's her husband's statement that she didn't want to be on life support -- but she's not on life support. She's breathing normally. ...\"\n \n Others claim Schiavo is in a vegetative state and doesn't understand what's happening. That, Dobson said, is also untrue. \n \n \"She is not in a 'vegetative' state. When you are in a vegetative state you can't respond to people. You don't follow things with your eyes when they're moved in front of you. You don't use words. She has said words like 'mommy' and 'help me' and other things. This woman is not in a vegetative state. Now I don't know that she could ever come out of this or be normal, but you don't kill people just because they're not going to be normal.\" \n\n \n Also, Terri's husband has been living with another woman over the past 7 years...\n \n While trying to sue his wife's doctors, Schiavo never indicated that she would want anything but rehabilitation - but after receiving the judgment, he put her in a nursing home where she received only minimal care. He used the money that was supposed to be spent on her therapy to pay the lawyers he'd hired to help him end her life. And he went on to father two children with the woman he's lived with the last seven years. \n\n (from: http://www.family.org/cforum/citizenmag/features/a0029484.cfm )\n \n A legal document should be required, expressing the wish to die in particular circumstances.",
