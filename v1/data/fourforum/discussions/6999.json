   "http://cobbtown.comPresident Bush spent a lot of time and energy attempting to convince Americans that his administration is concerned about the security of America's borders. He tried out his best Tom Tancredo imitation in Tucson, Arizona and El Paso, Texas recently, stating that \"We have a chance to move beyond the old and tired choices of the immigration debate and come together on a strategy to enforce our laws, secure our country, and uphold our deepest values.\" The President addressed the issues of national security, economic distress in overrun areas, and rising crime caused by illegals as if the present administration and his political partners in Congress really intended to solve the problems. In fact, Mr. Bush talked of beefed-up physical security along the borders, increased numbers of Border Patrol personnel, and new technology to assist our agents. He even touted a wonderful plan to increase detention facilities in order to scrap the scandalous \"catch and release\" policy which is currently in place due to lack of proper funding.\n \n Just as conservatives were getting a warm and fuzzy feeling, the speeches headed south of Tijuana. President Busy placed a great deal of emphasis on \"home repatriation\", a plan to fly illegals back to their home towns instead of dumping them just across our borders. While he spoke glowingly of the success of this tactic, it is questionable whether recidivism rates will remain low in the long term and just how much tens of thousands of first-class flights to Mexico City will cost Mr. and Mrs. American Taxpayer. Then, everything was lost when George II dropped the A-bomb - amnesty. He can call it a \"guest worker program\" or \"Pedro Does Dallas\", but it still means amnesty. His plan is to allow millions of illegals to go unpunished and become the de facto equals of Joe and Jane Kansas within six years.\n \n Americans must not allow this travesty which has brought us NAFTA, CAFTA, and now amnesty for illegals, to continue. Americans deserve secure borders, secure jobs, and a President that places the well being of his country's citizens above that of multi-nationals and foreign nationals.",

That would make for a really interesting payment imbalance, but it should bring down the trade deficit as you'd have no disposable income in the then completely internal transaction service economy to import short attention span diversions or service massive personal debt.
