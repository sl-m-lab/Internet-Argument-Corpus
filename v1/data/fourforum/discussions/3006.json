It seems in the begining of this article like they are addressing gays but......they are not. It seems to be the straights being their usual hypocrite selves.\n \n (Los Angeles, California) A California state assemblyman has told the porn industry to embrace safe sex or face legislation ordering it to ensure all male performers use condoms.\n \n The warning comes from Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood) who is chair of the Labor and Employment Committee.\n \n The openly gay legislator said adult film stars should receive workplace health and safety protections as all other Californians.\n \n \"I strongly encourage and fully expect the adult entertainment industry to require the use of condoms,\" Koretz said in a letter to 185 porn producers and publishers. \"Failure to do so is irresponsible and invites the Legislature to exercise its authority to mandate more stringent actions.\"\n \n The threat follows a recent HIV scare that prompted producers to stop filming for a few weeks. Two actors who regularly perform in straight porn videos tested positive for the virus.\n \n While the gay porn industry almost uniformly adopted mandatory condom use for its performers years ago the straight industry has rejected the move, even though many of the gay companies are owned by straight production companies. \n \n \"I don't think it's the place of the authorities to decide whether the (actors) are to use condoms or not,\" said Lexington Steele, president of Mercenary Pictures.\n \n \u00a9365Gay.com\u00ae 2004",

Fine. How about the HIGHLY suspicious \"NEW RECORDS\" found just this week about Bush's Guard Records? \n Conveniently found AFTER the government was SUED by the Associated Press for disclosure, and only AFTER the government SWORE that ALL records were already Released? \n Sounds a bit TOO convenient to me! \n \n Heck, at least Nixon had enough brains to know when the jig was up and to resign.
