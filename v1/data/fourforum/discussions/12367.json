   "The way I see it there's absolutely no justification in such a ban. The Heller ruling specifically stated that a ban on an entire class of firearms is unreasonable and unconstitutional. And if \"assault weapons\" don't qualify as an entire class of firearms, then I don't see what does.\n \n I don't think a new ban can even be justified. On lie the gun haters use to justify a ban is that the weapons in question are being used illegally and so widespread that thousands of lives are threatened. Another lie is the weapons in question are very rare and so any ban wouldn't inconvenience anybody since so few people actually own them.\n \n The problem is that both of these lies work against the gun haters. If \"assault weapons\" really are widespread and easy to get, then they can't legally be banned because the Heller ruling specifically mentioned weapons that were in common use.\n \n Now if they want to argue that \"assault weapons\" can be banned because so very few people own them, then they're admitting that they're used so rarely in crimes that banning them serves no practical purpose, and proves that they're not focused on saving lives or protecting anyone, otherwise they'd be going after the much bigger statistics.",

   "NATO 556. Since you brought up crime, I thought I would do a little digging. \n \n The anti-gun forces say that we need to spend all of our crime fighting efforts to combat the problem of Assault Weapons used in crime. Let&#8217;s look at the murder data to see if this is a warranted problem or they wasting out crime fighting time, tax dollars, and efforts. \n \n According to the FBI there is around 14,500 murders each year.\n Expanded Homicide Data Table 7 - Crime in the United States 2007\n These figures are for all rifle homicides both justifiable by police and by citizens, not just the so-called Assault Weapons. \n \n Again,All Rifles not just so called assault weapons. \n 2003 = 392 Equaling .027 of all murders\n 2004 = 403 Equaling .028 of all murders \n 2005 = 445 Equaling .029 of all murders \n 2006 = 438 Equaling .029 of all murders \n 2007 = 450 Equaling .03 of all murders\n \n Further we find that Personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.) is approximately twice that of all rifle homicides and are most likely to be murders, and not justifiable homicides. \n \n Personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.)\n 2003 = 962 \n 2004 = 943 \n 2005 = 905 \n 2006 = 841 \n 2007 = 854\n \n Some other categories that produce higher murder rates than ALL Rifles. \n Blunt objects (clubs, hammers, etc.) \n 2003 = 650\n 2004 = 667 \n 2005 = 608 \n 2006 = 618 \n 2007 = 647\n \n Knives or cutting instruments \n 2003 = 1,828 \n 2004 = 1,866 \n 2005 = 1,920 \n 2006 = 1,830 \n 2007 = 1,796 \n\n \n There is a lingering misconception, often added by the media, that so called assault weapons fire more than one bullet for each time the trigger is pulled. They do not. One pull of the trigger fires only one bullet, even if the trigger remains depressed. So called assault weapons operate no differently than a semi automatic handgun, or a semi automatic hunting rifle or shotgun. \n \n   This 11 minute youtube video offers a great demonstration of the differences.

They are regularly encountered in drug busts and are all too often used against our officers. In fact, one in five law enforcement officers slain in the line of duty between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2001, was killed with an assault weapon, according to \"Officer Down,\" a report from the Violence Policy Center. \n\n Ah, here is the quote in question. You mean this happened during the Assault Weapons ban then? The AWB did not expire till 2004. But please note the term Drug Dealer. Which can, in fact, import pretty much any Illegal thing they want.\n \n More from this article.   Reauthorization of the Assault Weapons Ban \nThe weapons in question-including the Colt AR-15, a semiautomatic version of the M-16 machine gun used by our armed forces, the Uzi, and the Tec-9 pistol, whose manufacturer's advertisements hailed its \"fingerprint-resistant\" finish- have been used in countless murders such as the Stockton schoolyard and Columbine High School shootings.\n \n \n But the Colt AR 15 is not included in the ban. This is rich. (\"fingerprint-resistant\" finish) This does not mean that it does not leave finger prints on the weapon, because it does. It means it does not corrode as easily. This is the same finish that is on most every new gun made to include the police Department guns. Now I am wondering who really wrote this article. :)\n \n OK for argument sake. Lets say that all Semi Autos are now confiscated. Does that mean the end to mass shootings? \n \n 1890's technology.

   "May 26, 2006\n Assault Rifles Worry Police in Alabama\n \n \"We've heard the NRA say before the assault weapons aren't used by criminals at all (supposedly making an assault weapon ban an ineffective weapon against crime), but guess what the police are worried about lately in Montgomery, Alabama. It ain't moon pies, we'll tell you that.\n \n Local law enforcement officials have worked at least four cases in the past month involving semi-automatic assault rifles, a rate that has caused some alarm.\n \n The Saturday shooting that left Michael Green, 20, of Montgomery on life support was committed with an assault rifle, according to police. Green, who was shot in the neck and the back, remained in critical condition Tuesday.\n \n Capt. Huey Thornton, a Montgomery police spokesman, said an assault rifle also was used in the May 14 slaying of 22-year-old Kimberly Davis at her Woodbrook Drive home.\n \n Thornton said although assault rifles like AK-47s and AR-15s are not used in a large percentage of the city's shootings, the Police Department is not going to be \"reactive\" to the situation.\n \n \"We're going to take a more proactive approach to establish a crimefighting initiative to get these guns out of the hands of the people who shouldn't have them,\" Thornton said. \"The chief is looking at some options of what can be done.\"\n \n How about banning the weapons completely? We've already done that in this country and it worked great for assault weapon crime. It's only because the NRA leaned on Congress that the assault weapons ban was allowed to expire a few years ago, and because it did, we're seeing murders like these.\n \n The problem faced by law enforcement is that these guns are legal and no permit is required to own them. Both AK-47s and AR-15s are readily available at area pawn shops and gun stores for between $500 and $1,000 for a new gun and about $200 to $300 less for a used gun.\n \n The pawn shop tag was still on an AK-47 that sheriff's deputies found during a traffic stop last week in Hope Hull, said Montgomery County Sheriff D.T. Marshall.\n \n Marshall said deputies went to the Vista Del Verde neighborhood on a complaint stemming from an ongoing argument. When the deputies stopped some of the people involved, they found the assault rifle, four handguns and some marijuana.\n \n The suspects also had two 30-bullet rifle clips taped together.\n \n \"They claimed they weren't going to pull any guns,\" Marshall said. \"But you tape the clips together like that so when you use up one clip you can put another one right in.\"\n \n Did you catch that? We'll bold it for you, just in case. Criminals are buying these guns through legal outlets and using them to kill Americans. So much for the NRA's theory that an assault weapons ban wouldn't work. An assault weapons ban would keep these weapons out of legal outlets, which would keep them out of the hands of criminals. But then, of course, gun manufacturers wouldn't be able to get their payday. So, for no reason at all, the killing goes on.\n \n Marshall said just a couple of days after that incident, deputies were called to an attempted suicide in which the man was threatening to use an assault rifle to kill himself.\n \n Although the constitution gives every citizen the right to bear arms, Marshall said there is no need for a regular citizen to possess these types of weapons.\n \n \"Everybody has a right to own a gun, but there's only one reason for owning a gun like that -- killing people. There's no other use other than to kill people. That's all they're made for,\" Marshall said.\n \n An assault weapons ban in this country is a no brainer-- in fact, that's probably why we passed it in the first place. Every one of these incidents that has happened since can be listed as directly the fault of the NRA. And they'll keep happening, until we get that lapsed ban passed again.\"\n http://www.gunguys.com/?p=1119",

   "If they were designed only to shoot from the hip you mean.\n \n Unless designed for both.\n\n \n Ah but that isn't the argument here. The claim is that these firearms were \"designed to be spray-fired from the hip\". Let me explain something to you. When something is designed, that means that it's built for a specific and unique purpose in mind at the time of its creation. So if they really were designed to be fired from the hip, as the anti-gun claim states, then they would never be equipped with sights and buttstocks, because neither are used and serve no useful purpose and just eat up valuable resources that could be put toward making more guns.\n \n You don't get to claim that they can do both to try and take the argument in a different direction, it doesn't work like that. Either these weapons are inaccurate and designed purely for firing off large amounts of ammunition in no particular direction, or they're made to be highly accurate and work like any other currently manufactured rifle and suitable for similar tasks.\n \n \nThat would be overstatement but I have always admitted my scant experience with firearms.\n \n Hence, the barrel shroud. I thought that for a traditional rifle the stock is all you hold, not the barrel itself.\n\n \n Very scant if you don't even know the basics involved with how you hold a rifle. Anybody with this knowledge would understand why so many people desire a heat shield, even if it's made out of wood as seen on some rifles.\n \n \nTrench coat?\n\n \n I have a trench coat that goes all the way down to my ankles. Even with that on I can't conceal one of my guns because it bulges outward far too much, even without the magazine inserted.

The American military used to use the .30-06, then the 7.62 NATO, now the 5.56 NATO, each one weaker than the last and with a shorter effective range. Same story with the Russian military, they originally had the 7.62x54R, then they switched to the 7.62x39mm, and now finally the 5.45x39mm, each one progressively weaker than the last.\n \n Meanwhile hunting rifles are getting more and more powerful, to the point where you can effectively kill a full grown elk with a single shot at 1,000 yards.",

Those guys in the Hollywood shoot out had full-auto ak-47's which were bought illegally through illegal channels. Even full-auto they didn't kill a single person, even if they were still shooting using the shoulder. You really have to be trained to shoot with a full-auto. It's not the same thing as a semi-auto. The police though were very badly trained. Where the heck was SWAT? Do remember the part where they crashed into the truck one of those guys stole? If that guy had some decent training he could have completely massacred those officers in that car. The way they drove into that truck was suicide! They were quite lucky that day. \n \n Besides that, \"assault weapons\" is a very dubious term. It is based on appearance and nothing more. If you look at how many they have been used in crime, they are the ones frequently used less. Why ban them? It's all pure fear tactics by the anti-gunners.

Btw how did the first ban get passed if they're \"run of the mill\"?\n\n Yep Heller was just the first shot in a whole series. However speaking of Miller,\n   Supreme Court UNITED STATES v. MILLER, 307 U.S. 174 (1939)\n \n In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State of Tennessee, 2 Humph., Tenn., 154, 158.\n \n \n Aymette was a case that was about the 2nd Amendment and carrying a Bowie Knife. In Aymette, they talked about weapons a Militia would use, and therefore a Bowie Knife could be considered Unusual. \n \n Miller was carrying a sawed off shotgun to commit crimes. A sawed off shotgun, unusual again. Now read the ruling again. What if Miller was a case with someone who was not committing a crime, and did not die before his trial? Like Dick Heller. Courts will not be complicit in helping you commit a crime, therefore when you ask for relief from a court, you MUST come in with clean hands. \n \n \nThe signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time. \n\n However, and according to the miller ruling, a semi auto has GOT to be considered as common Militia TO&E.\n \n To address dangerous. Every Anti-gunner always comes up with, Can you have a nuke or a missile under the 2nd? Therefore we can ban! Bull! The is the definition of Dangerous that was spoken of.",

Provides clear, uniform nationwide rules to provide an officer the means to defend themselves, their families and the community from the hardened and often vengeful criminals they have previously arrested. This bill was signed into law in 2004, but the final version contained limitations and restrictions that have, too often, defeated the original intent desired. This remains a 'work in progress'!\n \n Disarming a Law Enforcement Officer Act\n Makes it a felony to disarm, or attempt to disarm, a law enforcement officer of his or her firearm, baton, chemical spray, or any other weapon while in the course of his or her duties.\n \n Laser Safety Act\n Makes it a felony with mandatory incarceration to harass, intimidate or distract a law enforcement officer with a laser. Punishes those who force an officer into a potentially lethal defensive posture in response to a perceived deadly threat by the officer.\n \n Infectious Disease Testing Act\n Mandates testing of an incarcerated individual for infectious diseases if any police officer, corrections officer, EMT, paramedic, health care provider, or crime victim has come into contact with the incarcerated person's bodily fluids.\n \n Prison Labor Disclosure Act\n Requires companies and states that allow inmates to work as telemarketers or records clerks to disclose their status as incarcerated individuals, and to receive informed consent, prior to soliciting information from unsuspecting members of the public. Prevents unsuspecting citizens from unknowingly disclosing sensitive personal information such as their address, social security number, credit card, tax and medical information to those who have proven themselves unworthy of trust.\n \n Prison Weight Ban Act\n Prohibits access to free-weights, weight machines, or any other devices or exercise programs that would allow an inmate to increase their physical strength, and thus physical risk, to corrections personnel, or upon their release, police officers or potential crime victims. Also prohibits training and instruction in any fighting skills, martial arts, boxing or officer disarming techniques. (This Act does not prohibit participation in aerobics, basketball, or other traditional calisthenics programs.)\n\n \n   The LEAA Mission \n The Law Enforcement Alliance of America (LEAA) is the nation's largest non-profit, non-partisan coalition of law enforcement professionals, crime victims, and concerned citizens united for justice. With a major focus on public education, LEAA is dedicated to providing hard facts and real-world insights into the world of law enforcement and the battle against violent crime. LEAA fights at every level of government for legislation that reduces violent crime while preserving the rights of honest citizens, particularly the right of self-defense.\n \n With this goal in mind, LEAA is dedicated to :\n \n * focus the political debate on criminal behavior and criminal punishment\n \n * communicate the shared opinion of the majority of law enforcement officers that gun control is not an effective method of crime control\n \n * supporting legislation that helps target and punish criminals and protects law enforcement\n \n * providing critical information essential to law enforcement agencies, such as breaking the news on the attempted Federal takeover of state and local police departments.\n \n   LEAA's Board of Directors\n \n LEAA is proud to enjoy the invaluable service of a dedicated and experienced group of proven leaders. Take a moment to learn more about LEAA's Board of Directors and see why LEAA stands at the front of the line in providing education and guidance in the fields of law enforcement, criminal justice and citizen's rights.\n\n Just because an organization runs into common purposes does not mean that they are a bought and paid for arm of that Org.",

If you are talking about somebody just sticking it in their closet, biometrics are not all that secure. I can open my gun vault without my thumb print because I installed the system personally. Any would be thief who managed to circumvent my other security could probably do it even quicker and easier.\n \n In all reality, if you go safe shopping for a really high end safe, you will find that the absolute BEST ones still just have a good old fashioned twist dial combination lock. They are FAR, FAR more advanced than they used to be, and they have all kinds of advanced security features to keep people from doing the old stethscope on the door thing, but at the end of the day they are still considered the most secure locks there are. \n \n Why??",

   "I did not realize the LEAA was NRA funded. I will be the FIRST to agree that the NRA is dishonest. They even pretend to be a pro gun group when, in fact, they have negotiated, and given approval, to virtually every gun control law passed in the last 30 years, all the while telling their members \"Send us money so we can protect your rights\"....yea...right...more like \"Send us money so we can negotiate your rights away\". \n \n The worthless slimeballs at the NRA fought like hell to kill the heller case, and then when CATO pushed it through and achieved a landmark victory, the NRA stepped in and tried to take credit for it. \n \n So...yea...the NRA is completely dishonest. They have wound up in the same situation as so many other well meaning groups...there is too much money in the fight for them to risk actually winning it.\n\n \n I agree with the part I highlighted (who wouldn't) and believe it says a lot in a few words. Since it applies to several subjects unrelated to gun control, rather than derail this thread I've started another in the politics forum. Anyone interested in exploring this further can check in there. :)",
