You mean to tell me that it is the last fail-safe guarding the people from a despotic government that seeks to supress their natural rights as people? Are you kidding? Shouldn't a pure government, as ours is, never again have to worry about such a improbable threat? No one in their right mind would claim that those brilliant framers of our nation would have ever suspected the degradation of the system that they developed. It is impossible to think that these miracle workers would be critical of all forms of government, yet fail to subscribe to anarchy. Pure lunatics these framers, which held such antequated ideals.
