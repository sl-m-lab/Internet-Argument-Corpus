   "BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (WPIX) -- A video which shows an exorcism of a teen to drive out apparent \"homosexual demons\" has sparked outrage among several gay rights activists.\n \n The video, which was posted on YouTube, features church elders from the Manifested Glory Ministries Church in Bridgeport performing the exorcism on the boy who is said to be 16-years-old.\n \n \"Right now I command you to leave!\" screamed one of the church leaders involved with the exorcism in the video.\n \n The teenager is seen rolling around on the ground, moaning and screaming - at one point he even vomits.\n \n Although it was never confirmed to be a gay exorcism, repeated references to the subject's sexual orientation suggests it was.\n \n \"Right now in the name of Jesus, I call the homosexuality, right now in the name of Jesus,\" a church elder is heard screaming to the teen.\n \n It's unclear when the 20 minute video was made or if the teen suffered any physical injuries from what appeared to be near seizures.\n \n Although the exorcism appears to be the first one of its kind captured on video, advocacy groups for gay youths say the practice happens all the time.\n\n Apparent Gay Exorcism in Conn. Church Causes Outrage - Los Angeles Times\n \n When we see it like this, of course people think it's absurd. Most people that is...\n \n Ignorance is a huge predictor in support for discrimination against gays.\n Most rational people can recognize that being gay is not a choice. Yet a large segment of our population still thinks that being gay is about \"choosing\" to be gay.\n Thankfully, education is changing that...In the opening lines the story makes clear the significance of the poll: for the first time in history, the majority of people polled on the issue of whether gays \"choose\" their sexuality said that they do not believe that sexuality is a choice. This group made up 56 percent of respondents, up from 45 percent in 2001 and 36 percent in 1998.CNN's latest poll: Gay not a choice | AfterElton.com\n Indeed, the poll found that people's views of homosexuality as a choice or inborn trait are a stark predictor of their views: two-thirds of those who think people are born gay support same-sex marriage, for example, compared to just 15 percent of those who think homosexuality is a choice.Poll Shows 'Nuanced' Views on Homosexuality - News",

Of course not.\n But you have TONS of posts in the gay threads, don't you...\n \n The fact that you toss out a passage that involves more \"sexual immorality\" than just homosexuality does not erase your habitually consistent application to JUST COMPLAIN about the gays.\n \n Adultery and divorce is more rampant (and legal) than homosexuality...\n But WHAT do you complain about?\n Gays...\n \n \n \nI mean, I couldn't have been more clear in showing that it is God who has the problem with your lifestyle and not me.\n\n Then let God take it up with me.\n You sounding off on the subject is obviously trying to generate condemnation.\n \n Again, I repeat YOUR BOOK'S bible passages for you...\n \n Judge not, lest ye be judged.\n Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.\n You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.\n \n At least one of us is being honest in the admitting that he isn't following your book. And it ain't you...\n \n \n \nWhy would I ignore that point.\n\n Irrelevant compared to the fact THAT YOU DID...\n \n \n \nIt is a good and true point but you never made it.\n\n Archie, I WAS making that point.\n Whether or not you recognized it is an entirely different subject...\n \n \n \nBy telling you the truth and correctly and accurately interpreting Gods word for you, I am helping you.\n\n Just like I am helping you by repeating your bible to you!\n But again, only one of us is being honest in acknowledging they are ignoring the bible's words...\n \n Archie, I have heard your message a thousand times.\n At this stage, you're just being a nuisance in repeating it.\n \n Luk 9:5 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them. \n \n Even your bible recognizes that when you aren't received, you should leave it alone...\n \n \n \nBut unfortunately, you only accept that which feeds your fleshly desires and supports your world view of choice. So the spiritual truths I share aren't received or appreciated by you. \n\n < snore <\n Archie, you don't have \"spiritual\" truths.\n You have truths that I have to believe are true before I can see them as true, in which case I have to have already believed they were true cause only then can I think they are true, because I have to have believe they are true first ...\n \n THAT is not truth.\n \n You confuse spirituality with your religion.\n \n \n \nHere again is what I said. It doesn't jive with your criticism of it at all.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Cause I was not criticizing those words.\n I was talking about your flawed approach that your own bible repudiates.\n \n \n \nI mean, note the bolded, it doesn't matter how non judgmental I am, you will not receive it unless I tell you that what you promote is right and normal according to Gods standards.\n\n It's funny to watch people like you and your little Freudian slips.\n Like above. How you improperly insert YOURSELF into what should conceptually be a relationship between myself and God.\n \n A real Christian would recognize that YOU have no real part in me coming to Jesus.\n Furthermore, YOU need to realize that your own actions have probably driven away a LOT more people than you could imagine to have helped....\n \n Tell me Archie.\n Have you EVER convinced another soul to come to Jesus by your actions on these boards???\n Never mind. I've asked you before and you always duck the question.\n \n Your own bible talks about knowing people by their fruits, and yours is barren.\n You insist on beating the land and insisting that it has to grow fruit, yet you can't recognize that it doesn't.\n \n Archie, I realize that you aren't really talking \"with\" me, and that is part of the reason you fail...\n But I've got to ask anyways...\n What do you think is the difference between you and a Pharisee of Jesus's time?",

How is that debating at all when we obviously both agree on this point since I said it first? \n\n \n Those ancient writers did not understand sexuality as a concept. The word \"homosexual\" was only added in the 1950s. It's ridiculous to think that people in the 1st century were speaking in terms of heterosexuals and homosexuals.\n \n I'd say it's in the heterosexual male's nature to look at a woman as though he wants her, lusts for her physically. It's not like looking at a beautiful painting, or sculpture, or architecture, and admiring it. Therefore he is damned. The Bible is full of contradictions and hypocrisy, and the most highly religious have willful blindness to it. What's worse, they will pick and choose to suit their homophobia.\n \n \nNow this corruption of the passage is a different story altogether, and I can't allow your misrepresentation to stand.

And that is no small feat considering the generation they come from; you know, this one!\n\n \n The verse clearly states these chosen men were virgins, because they had not been defiled by women. Indeed, this is no small feat for heterosexual men of any generation. It was even more unusual in the ancient world in which the Bible was written, than it is today. The message here is clear. God is saying that being with a woman, sexually, defiles a man. You can't say it only refers to some Jews, and then scoff when people argue that the verses said to condemn same-sex sexual actions refer specifically to pagan idol worshippers and temple prostitutes. \n \n \nSo Jake, your example couldn't do more to support my argument that God cares about purity, sexual innocence and abstinence even in these end times as He prepares His return as the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. He will find 144,000 pure and undefiled men in these last days whom He has chosen to prepare the way for the returning Messiah, and yes, that is a miracle in this day and age.\n\n \n Those men who had sex with a woman won't be among those redeemed from the sinful, dirty, impure, people, that the all-perfect God supposedly created.

You can't wait to tell people the sins they are living, I'm sure that sense of superiority you feel more than makes up for whatever is lacking in your life. I can't help but notice that you do protest just a tad too much about the \"sin\" of others. Let's also get beyond the \"you so hate the truth that you are offended by it\", I have no idea what that means but it sounds like another excuse for you to tell everyone how much better you are. I gotta' tell you, you are the absolute worst spokesperson for your religion.

   "You're missing the point by a mile. It's not the WORD \"myth\" that can be insulting. It's the use of it. Your approach might not be a problem if it didn't have REAL world implications that happen every day. If someone has a grieving widow around them, and that widow is taking comfort from the Bible's idea that her late husband is in heaven, it's offensive to be trying to make an issue that you think those scriptures are a myth. Even if you think it's true. Religious belief is often a matter of sacredness to people. Frankly, I think some people are just prudish on this. You may not like religion or sacred scriptures, and think it's all a bunch of bunk. That's fine. But others take enormous comfort from it.\n\n \n \n Believing in myths are reality has real world implications as well. \n \n If someone asks my opinion about religion and I tell them it's hokum, that's my opinion. Your \"grieving widow\" whine that you repeatedly drag up is baloney. Of course no one would kick someone when they are down and I would keep my mouth shut in such a situation to prevent hurting the poor dear's feelings. But in general, I think it's perfectly acceptable to express opinions about anything I think is bogus. Why does religion get a pass?\n \n God exists or God does not exist. One of those things is true. Either way that doesn't alter what people believe or hold sacred. I can believe in any fool thing I want and if that gives me comfort it doesn't make it any more or less true. If I believe in unbelievable things I should expect to be called on it at least now and again. When it comes to believing the unsubstantiated, you can't blame the skeptic. The credulous one will naturally get labeled as such.\n \n You are not denying the mythology, only defending the right to be immune from criticism for believing that myths are reality.",

   "The criticism of religion that the anonymity this forum provides greatly exceeds the way religion is generally treated in public, and you know it.\n\n \n But that very well may not be because it's \"given a pass\", but rather because not every agrees with your premise that it's up to something for which it needs a pass to begin with. I think the view that religion is harmful as a generality is very much out of the mainstream, and it certainly doesn't fit observation. In most cases, it's not harmful, so the discussion that it even needs a 'pass' is moot, IMO. Where it IS quantifiably harmful, such as when we see nutcases killing abortion doctors in the name of religion, it doesn't get a pass. That's exactly why so many religious groups condemned the recent case of such.\n \n \nI think there are many reasons to criticize religion - it has many features that cause harm, not the least of which is that its underlying premise, the existence of god, is simply not true.

Religion disallows our criticism of itself, it must only be whispered about in reverent tones - a handy way to perpetuate itself because a dispassionate evaluation exposes its empty ideas.\n\n \n I prefer to add another qualifier and say that \"Ridiculous harmful ideas should not be afforded any level of courtesy and respect.\" My observation is that the vast majority of religious people are not harmful with their religion. In cases where people are using their religion as an impetus for harm, that's a wholly different story and in that case I would agree that it should not be respected and instead should be condemned. But not religion as it plays out with most people. I also think that it's a generalisation to say that religion disallows criticism of itself. In fact, religion can sometimes be it's own biggest critic. I think that's exactly what we see Jesus doing in the way he deallt with the Pharisees in the gospels. Harmful religion causes harm, not just religion itself. What you're doing is engaging in the same sort of fallacy when people say \"sex causes STDs\" instead of saying \"unprotected sex causes STDs.\"\n \n Now, are there examples where religion causes harm that it DOES get a pass? Yes, of course. But I think these are the exceptions in terms of how religion is typically conducted in every-day folks, and so the sweeping idea that religion is a negative thing is unfair, IMO; it's an example of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. And I realize (if I understand your view correctly) that your position is that even the mere belief in religious things is harmful, but I think that's a huge stretch. Even if the things religion professes to believe in are not empirically true, non-truism does not equate to harm, by default.\n \n I also realize 'harm' can be an eye-of-the-beholder matter; I've pointed that out myself before. But largely I think this comes down to giving the benefit of the doubt--having a tolerant standard for views over which we don't agree, and then condemning them only when we believe there is clear harm. I don't think you can quantify or qualify harm over nothing more than believing in an old man in the sky, or a flying spaghetti monster.",

That's the cool thing about this country, you don't have to follow everyone else and nobody has to follow you.\n \n \n \nAs someone before me said, my relationship with god is between me and god, you play no role in that, it's simply none of your business and how unchristian of you to try to get in the way of whatever relationship with god I choose to have.\n\n \n \n \nHold on a second here mojo! Is this the type of dishonest discourse I can expect from you? You said this, above:\n\n \n \nThis was a personal attack on me even though I said nothing to provoke it at all. And I responded with this:\n\n \n \nAnd as far as what church you belong to? I could care less. But if your best excuse at disagreeing with someone is to say they need god's intervention tells me you use your religion as a crutch.\n\n \n Yeah? I'm not telling you what to believe in, I'm telling you to act appropriate to others and stop using your personal beliefs as a crutch/weapon. Don't you see? The pro-gay rights side is not telling you how to live your life, they are telling you to back off so that they can live theirs. They are allowed to believe or not believe in god any way they choose, that's really what it comes down to, right? It's not about the sex, it's about what others are allowed to do that you feel is a sin. Last I checked the 10 commandments don't mention anything about gay sex but they do mention something about taking the lord's name in vain which happens a heck of a lot more than what you perceive as sexual debauchery. Why don't you start a campaign about religious foul language? Or, if Christianity should be the only game in town why don't you picket some mosques or synagogues? It all amounts to the same thing as gay sex, doesn't it? people doing things that you perceive are an affront to your personal views on religion. \n \n Oh, and back to this:\n \n \nWe all need Gods intervention in our lives. How sad that you are oblivious to that fact.\n\n \n You claim this is not aggressive? You are partly right, it's passive-aggressive, get over it, think what you want but again, my views on religion are none of your business. I'm not inviting you into that part of my life which you happen to wear on your sleeve. Nothing wrong with that but don't get upset when people push back who didn't invite you in.\n \n \n \n \nWould you quote where I got all bent out of shape for you supposedly maligning my religion mojo? Please link to or quote the passages I wrote to you above that were so insulting or angry. And then quote me maligning you in any way at all if you will. I really think you are projecting some perceived anger you have for someone else, upon me. \n\n \n Oh, when you claimed I made a personal attack on you when discussing your religion, after I pointed out that I really don't care what your religion is.\n \n \n \n \nAgain, really? What sins have I pointed out to you? And what is superior when I have submitted my life to Christ and confessed my sins to Him as I admitted that I need Him to guide me in this life since I failed on my own merits? Does that sound like a superior elitest to you? Or are you lashing out at me because there is some deep seeded conviction in you which you are fighting with all of your energy and might! Could that be what's going on with your anger mojo?\n\n \n Strawman. I never brought up what Jesus did or did not do for/to you. I have no idea why you are trying to play victim here when you have attacked others for questioning a topic (your personal faith) that you seem hell bent on pulling over everyone else. \n \n \n \n \nWhat sins of others have I protested too much about mojo? List them for me if you can, ok?\n\n \n homosexuality. Are you going to tell me that you also didn't say how sad I was because I am a nonbeliever of your religion?\n \n \n \n \nThere you go again thinking I'm better than you. I'm not mojo. I'm a sinner who was and is in dire need of Gods grace and mercy which is why I accepted Jesus as my savior and redeemer. Because I realized my spiritual need. And when I share Jesus here, I'm just hoping that you will also realize your spiritual need too. That is an act of love which will lead you to an eternity with your maker. It isn't an act of violence or hatred in any way. It is an act of love to share the eternal truth with you.\n\n \n Yeah, I really, honestly don't care what gets you through your day just as long as it works for you. Believe what you want but here you go again pretending we are somehow playing the same game, we aren't. I am absolutely fine in my own beliefs and I'm telling you here, I don't care to be preached to, especially from someone who has no problem telling others how to live their life and has no problem letting the U.S. government do the dirty work for them.\n \n \nYour angry responses and attacks on me as if I am attempting to insult you or somehow defeat you is patently ridiculous and unfair. But I get responses like this all the time from people like you who are angry not at me, but at the truths I share here. You should sincerely investigate what I say rather than lash out at perceived attacks which I never made and claims of superiority which I don't have or gay fantasies which have never existed for me.\n\n \n I'm not angry at you I just don't respect anyone who won't leave well enough alone. Stop feeling that you have the right to interfere and tell others how to live their lives, that's god's job, isn't it? Let him judge, he didn't appoint you and if others don't live to your standards, tough. You aren't living up to my standards, you aren't living up to anyone's standards but your own. Stop playing victim and telling me about how others get angry with you because you pretend to have all the answers, you don't, you're one person, pretend just for a day to be that lowly sinner you claim to be and actually put your religion aside when discussing the merits of other people's lives, trust me they understand themselves better than you do.",

   "But that very well may not be because it's \"given a pass\", but rather because not every agrees with your premise that it's up to something for which it needs a pass to begin with. I think the view that religion is harmful as a generality is very much out of the mainstream, and it certainly doesn't fit observation. In most cases, it's not harmful, so the discussion that it even needs a 'pass' is moot, IMO. Where it IS quantifiably harmful, such as when we see nutcases killing abortion doctors in the name of religion, it doesn't get a pass. That's exactly why so many religious groups condemned the recent case of such.\n\n \n You are twisting the argument. When I say that religion \"gets a pass\", I mean that frank criticism of religion in general is mostly off limits. It is considered shocking, \"irreverent\" or \"sacrilegious\". By definition, we do not speak ill of the sacred. That is all well and good for those who consider religious drivel sacred, but not so much for others.\n \n \n \n \n\n I prefer to add another qualifier and say that \"Ridiculous harmful ideas should not be afforded any level of courtesy and respect.\" My observation is that the vast majority of religious people are not harmful with their religion. In cases where people are using their religion as an impetus for harm, that's a wholly different story and in that case I would agree that it should not be respected and instead should be condemned. But not religion as it plays out with most people. I also think that it's a generalisation to say that religion disallows criticism of itself. In fact, religion can sometimes be it's own biggest critic. I think that's exactly what we see Jesus doing in the way he deallt with the Pharisees in the gospels. Harmful religion causes harm, not just religion itself. What you're doing is engaging in the same sort of fallacy when people say \"sex causes STDs\" instead of saying \"unprotected sex causes STDs.\"\n \n Now, are there examples where religion causes harm that it DOES get a pass? Yes, of course. But I think these are the exceptions in terms of how religion is typically conducted in every-day folks, and so the sweeping idea that religion is a negative thing is unfair, IMO; it's an example of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. And I realize (if I understand your view correctly) that your position is that even the mere belief in religious things is harmful, but I think that's a huge stretch. Even if the things religion professes to believe in are not empirically true, non-truism does not equate to harm, by default.\n \n I also realize 'harm' can be an eye-of-the-beholder matter; I've pointed that out myself before. But largely I think this comes down to giving the benefit of the doubt--having a tolerant standard for views over which we don't agree, and then condemning them only when we believe there is clear harm. I don't think you can quantify or qualify harm over nothing more than believing in an old man in the sky, or a flying spaghetti monster.\n\n \n I am saying religious thinking in itself is harmful. It is harmful to the intellect. I cannot see how believing in something that is not real can be okay even if it provides comfort. If one is willing to suspend one's thinking without scrutiny on a topic that is a large part of one's life, that is a set up for manipulation. If you don't believe that, I have a prayer hankie I can sell you.",

For instance, it has certainly not been off-limits in our society to criticize the culprits of abuse among Catholic clergy. Or the nutcase who killed an abortion doctor recently.

That they don't come to the same conclusions you do or that they believe in non-empirical things in ADDITION to what is empirically 'knowable' doesn't mean they're not scrutinizing or are suspending anything. It may simply mean they've come to different conclusions than you. The bottom line is that the only conclusion you would consider as NOT being a suspension of intellect is that of non-theism, no?

   "And what would be more ironic, more worthy of the \"father of lies\", than if he is actually the one behind your Christianity and you are really worshiping Satan himself and DON'T EVEN KNOW IT!

Here's what I mean:\n 1Pe 1:2 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure. \n 1Pe 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, \n 1Pe 1:4 to {obtain} an inheritance {which is} imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, \n 1Pe 1:5 who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. \n 1Pe 1:6 In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, \n 1Pe 1:7 so that the proof of your faith, {being} more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; \n 1Pe 1:8 and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, \n 1Pe 1:9 obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls. \n 1Pe 1:10 As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that {would come} to you made careful searches and inquiries, \n 1Pe 1:11 seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. \n 1Pe 1:12 It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven--things into which angels long to look. \n 1Pe 1:13 Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober {in spirit,} fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. \n 1Pe 1:14 As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts {which were yours} in your ignorance, \n 1Pe 1:15 but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all {your} behavior; \n 1Pe 1:16 because it is written, \"YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.\" \n ",

   "Where criticism is reasonable, I don't see it usually being off-limits at all. For instance, it has certainly not been off-limits in our society to criticize the culprits of abuse among Catholic clergy. Or the nutcase who killed an abortion doctor recently.\n\n Wow. Talk about apples and oranges.\n You just went from people criticizing RELIGION, to criticizing priests who VIOLATE THE LAW...\n Obviously (at least to most people) not the same thing.\n \n \n \nBut yes, when the criticism tends to boil down to associating it with ignorance (that which is a suspension of intellect) as you've engaged in here, indeed, people don't go for that too well.\n\n I think the more accurate assessment is how religion involves an abandonment of reason and/or critical thinking, as is shown by looking at the very definition of \"faith\".\n faith: firm belief in something for which there is no proof\n \n In fact, when it goes to the extent of believing in something DESPITE CONTRADICTING PROOF, that demonstrates a rather thorough abandonment of reason and/or critical thinking.\n \n \n \nI think that's because they ARE reasonable, not because they aren't.\n\n That's the wonderful thing about apologetics.\n You can just keep on creating more \"reasons\" (read excuses) for why the obviously contradictory scenario is supposedly not contradictory.... \n \n \n \nWhere we can quantifiably SHOW religion harming society...\n\n And there it is...\n \n I invite the viewing audience to recognize the shift that has happened here.\n This whole discussion started when Jyoshu was criticizing me for saying that I felt Christianity was a myth. He produced a bleeding heart \"widow\" story to further his claim...\n \n And now, instead of relying on ludicrous hypothetical scenarios, when the shoe goes on the other foot, THEN he wants a \"quantifiable\" demonstration of harm...\n \n For me saying Christianity is a myth? I hurt the feelings of an imaginary widow.\n For somebody else talking about religion being damaging? He wants a quantified demonstration of harm...\n \n \n \nI realize you believe that, but I can't sit here and ignore that your view quite simply doesn't jibe with the reality I've had with religion or religious people in general.\n\n emoticon_wow\n How can you say that as the proof of thelmoose's statements exists THROUGHOUT HISTORY...\n TONS of scientific discovery and advancement held up because of religion. Demands that corpses not be desecrated, and absurd (and long-since abandoned) superstitions that inhibited scientific progress.\n \n Today? \n How about the fight against teen-age pregnancy? The MOST EFFECTIVE method is to teach the kids EVERYTHING, but religion insists on the \"just say no\" approach which is proven not to work.\n Stem cells. There is absolutely no logic in insisting that it's more moral to dispose of existing zygotes, as opposed to allowing them to be used in medical research.\n \n \n \nIn my experience, religious belief often doesn't involve suspending one's thinking.\n\n :xbanghead\n Somebody tells you to think \"Jesus is God\".\n How much independent thought goes into believing what you're told to believe?\n \n It's basically a regurgitation of the same mythos over the centuries, with modifications fought against based on the opinions that some people wrote down millenia ago.\n \n \n \nReligious people are among those that scrutinize religion the most.\n\n Really?\n Christian God? Is his policy on damning anybody who doesn't believe in him to hell a \"good\" thing? Or a \"bad\" thing?\n Please. Show me your \"scrutiny\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Or how about \"homosexuality is immoral\"?\n Why? Cause God told you so...\n Scrutiny completed! :xbanghead\n \n \n \nThat they don't come to the same conclusions you do or that they believe in non-empirical things in ADDITION to what is empirically 'knowable' doesn't mean they're not scrutinizing or are suspending anything.\n\n Are you for real?\n emoticon_wow\n \n \n \nIt may simply mean they've come to different conclusions than you.\n\n \"different conclusions\"???\n Religion typically TELLS YOU WHAT CONCLUSIONS you need to reach, and insists that you have to stick to them in order to be a part of the religion.\n \n \n \nThe bottom line is that the only conclusion you would consider as NOT being a suspension of intellect is that of non-theism, no? And I think that's a rather intellectually unfair assumption on your part.\n\n If somebody rolls a dice and sticks a cup over it, so that nobody knows what the value of the dice is...\n And somebody comes along and insists that it has to be \"3\", cause that's what their religion told them to think...\n \n Believing it is \"3\" because somebody, who lived thousands of years ago and somebody (who thought that genocide, slavery, and forced marriages were moral) told you to believe \"3\" is not intellectual.",

(It make TAKE them longer to come around in some cases, but they typically do.) If people DON'T believe the sun is a chariot, but rather believe what science is telling them, then how does that make them like the ancient religious believers in the example you just gave? Look, why should it matter when someone doesn't sacrifice acceptance what observation shows? For the scientific religious person, anything science shows in terms of process only shows the natural order of things as put in motion by God--they don't deny that process however. They accept it. But I have YET to see anything in nature that disproves God. I think you're probably barking up the wrong tree, here, because you're talking to someone who has absolutely no problem accepting what's proven by science. You're talking to someone who has no problem reconciling the two and NOT suspending intellect. Someone who fully accepts that life came about though the evolutionary process, for instance. And (to keep this discussion at least somewhat on topic) I fully accept what science has shown us about sexual orientation. So when you tell me that religion involves suspension of intellect just in its mere existence, I just don't find that to be the case from personal experience.\n \n For me, the only frustrating thing here is that you believe religion can't EXIST without suspension of intellect, because I don't find that to be the case.

   "Blah blah blah. The same old denials and excuses as you lash out that anyone who rejects your lies just has to be a homophobe and a bigot. Well I'm not alone in my observations foundit, and here is why your lies and denials stick. And it isn't because they have merit or any substance based in truth at all.\n The Gay Question\n Amid the Catholic Church's current scandals, an unignorable issue.\n \n By Rod Dreher, from the April 22, 2002, issue of National Review\n \n \n \n he first thing to understand about the Catholic Church's pedophilia scandal is that it is not technically a pedophilia scandal. Despite the gruesome example of defrocked Boston priest John Geoghan, whose case started the current tidal wave of revelations, the overwhelming majority of priests who have molested minors are not pedophiles - that is, like Geoghan, among the rare adults sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children. They are, rather, \"ephebophiles\" - adults who are sexually attracted to post-pubescent youths, generally aged 12 to 17. And their victims have been almost exclusively boys. \n \n Stephen Rubino, a New Jersey lawyer, says that of the over 300 alleged victims of priest sex abuse he has represented, roughly 85 percent are boys, and were teenagers when the abuse occurred. Dr. Richard Fitzgibbons, an eminent Catholic psychiatrist who has treated scores of victims and priest-perpetrators, says 90 percent of his patients were either teen male victims of priests, or priests who abused teen boys. \n \n \"I think we have to ask the question: Why are 90 percent to 95 percent, and some estimates say as high as 98 percent, of the victims of clergy [abuse] teenage boys? . . . We need to ask that question, and I think there's a certain reluctance to raise that issue,\" said the Rev. Donald B. Cozzens, author of The Changing Face of the Priesthood, on a recent Meet the Press.\n \n The reluctance arises, no doubt, partly out of a fear of antagonizing homosexual anti-defamation groups, who resent the stereotype of male homosexuals as pederasts. It's much safer to focus inquiry on the question of mandatory celibacy, or the issue of ordaining women. Yet it defies common sense to imagine that an ordinary man, having made a vow not to marry, is therefore going to be sexually attracted to boys. Indeed, suppose the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s had admitted married men to the ranks of the Catholic priesthood: Would a single adolescent boy molested over the past 40 years have escaped his fate? Similarly, if women had been ordained, would that somehow have made sexually predatory gay priests disappear?\n \n No, this is chiefly a scandal about unchaste or criminal homosexuals in the Catholic priesthood, and about far too many in Church leadership disinclined to deal with the problem - or, worse, who may in some cases be actively involved in the misconduct. For Catholics, to start asking questions about homosexuality in the priesthood is to risk finding out more than many Church members prefer to know. For journalists, to confront the issue is to risk touching the electrified third rail of American popular culture: the dark side of homosexuality. Yet when we learn that the greatest crisis the Catholic Church in America has ever faced has been brought upon it almost wholly by male clerics seducing boys, attention must be paid to the man behind the curtain.\n \n It is true that a great many gay people are sickened and appalled by what these wicked priests have done to boys, and some with a public voice, like journalist Andrew Sullivan, have vigorously denounced it. At the same time, Sullivan has strongly supported the ministry of gay priests. \n \n How many gay priests are there? No one can say with certainty; the American bishops have never formally studied the issue, and, for obvious reasons, it is all but impossible to determine an accurate number. Richard Sipe, a laicized priest and psychotherapist who has studied the phenomenon of priests and sex abuse for most of his 40-year career, believes 20 percent of Catholic priests are homosexual, and that half of those are sexually active. In his book, Fr. Cozzens cites various studies putting the total much higher, but these surveys typically suffer from methodological problems that skew the numbers upward.\n \n But those who lowball the numbers could equally be accused of wanting to downplay the problem. The Rev. C. John McCloskey, a member of the conservative Opus Dei organization, claimed recently that the number of gay priests is \"two percent to four percent at a maximum,\" or equivalent to the estimated number of homosexuals in the general population; if that were true, however, it would be hard to explain why, according to experts, Catholic priests are dying of AIDS at a higher rate than males in the general population. \n \n THE LAVENDER MAFIA\n The raw numbers are less important, though, if homosexual priests occupy positions of influence in the vast Catholic bureaucracy; and there seems little doubt that this is the case in the American Church. Lest this be dismissed as right-wing paranoia, it bears noting that psychotherapist Sipe is no conservative - indeed, he is disliked by many on the Catholic Right for his vigorous dissent from Church teaching on sexual morality - yet he is convinced that the sexual abuse of minors is facilitated by a secret, powerful network of gay priests. Sipe has a great deal of clinical and research experience in this field; he has reviewed thousands of case histories of sexually active priests and abuse victims. He is convinced of the existence of what the Rev. Andrew Greeley, the left-wing clerical gadfly, has called a \"lavender Mafia.\"\n \n \"This is a system. This is a whole community. You have many good people covering it up,\" Sipe says. \"There is a network of power. A lot of seminary rectors and teachers are part of it, and they move to chancery-office positions, and on to bishoprics. It's part of the ladder of success. It breaks your heart to see the people who suffer because of this.\"\n \n In his new book, Goodbye! Good Men, Michael S. Rose documents in shocking detail how pervasive militant homosexuality is in many seminaries, how much gay sex is taking place among seminarians and priest-professors, and how gay power cliques exclude and punish heterosexuals who oppose them. \"It's not just a few guys in a few seminaries that have an ax to grind. It is a pattern,\" says Rose. \"The protective network [of homosexual priests] begins in the seminaries.\"\n \n The stories related in Rose's book will strike many as incredible, but they track closely with the stories that priests have told me about open gay sex and gay politicking in seminaries. The current scandal is opening Catholic eyes: As one ex-seminarian says, \"People thought I was crazy when I told them what it was like there, so I finally quit talking about it. They're starting to see now that I wasn't.\"\n \n Goodbye! Good Men links homosexuality among priests with theological dissent, a connection commonly made by conservative Catholics who wonder why their parish priests have practically abandoned teaching and explaining Catholic sexual morality. But one veteran vocations-team member for a conservative diocese cautions that Catholics should not assume that theological orthodoxy guarantees heterosexuality or chastity. \"You find [active homosexuality] among some pretty conservative orders, and in places you'd not expect it,\" he says. \"That's what makes this so depressing. You don't know where to turn.\"\n \n An especially nasty aspect of this phenomenon is the vulnerability of sexually active gay priests and bishops to manipulation via blackmail. Priests, psychiatrists, and other informed parties say they encounter this constantly. \"It's the secrecy,\" says Stephen Rubino. \"If you're a bishop and you're having a relationship, and people know about it, are you compromised on dealing with sexually abusive priests? You bet you are. I've seen it happen.\"\n \n Longtime observers predict that in the coming weeks, bishops and priests will be forced to resign under fire after their closeted homosexual lives, including sexual abuse, become public. The disgraced pederast former bishop of Palm Beach, Fla., is probably not alone. If this happens, the Vatican will face mounting pressure from the Catholic rank-and-file to take action. As Fr. Greeley has written, \"The laity, I suspect, would say it is one thing to accept a homosexual priest and quite another to accept a substantially homosexual clergy, many of whom are blatantly part of the gay subculture.\"\n \n Rome has explicitly discouraged the ordination of homosexuals since at least 1961. For the past decade, the Vatican has been ratcheting up the pressure against gay ordination - to little avail in most U.S. dioceses. Last year, Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone, a top Vatican official, said gays should not be admitted to seminaries, a line that was reinforced in early March by the Pope's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls. Recent reports indicate that the Vatican may soon release another document to restate and clarify this policy.\n \n Today, those who defend allowing homosexuals into the priesthood point to the Church's official teaching, which distinguishes between homosexual orientation (which the Church does not consider sinful) and homosexual acts (which the Catechism labels \"grave depravity\"). There is nothing wrong, the argument goes, with ordaining a homosexually oriented man committed to living chastely and to upholding the Church's teaching on sexuality. Surely there are many such faithful priests in service. \n \n This argument, though, seems persuasive only under conditions far removed from those under which priests have to live today. We now have a culture in which there is little support for chastity, even from within the ranks of the Catholic priesthood. Conservative theologian Michael Novak says he is not prepared to argue for the exclusion of homosexuals from ordination, but as an ex-seminarian, he strongly believes gays should not be on seminary faculties, directing the formation in chastity of young men. Other Catholics who are more liberal than Novak on many Church issues go further on the question of gay ordination: Sipe believes gays shouldn't be admitted into seminaries at the present time - for their own protection, against sexual predators among the faculty and administration, who will attempt to draw them into a priestly subculture in which gay sex is normative behavior. Fr. Thomas P. Doyle, another critic of celibacy who has been deeply involved in the clergy-abuse issue, concurs: \"Ordaining gay men at this time would be putting them, no matter how good and dedicated, in a precarious position.\"\n \n No one wants to stigmatize homosexuals as abusers, because most of them are not. Still, it's hard to gainsay the contention that if there were few homosexuals in the priesthood, the number of sex-abuse victims today would be drastically lower. \"We're learning a significant lesson from all this,\" says Dr. Fitzgibbons. \"We have to protect our young. The protection of children and teenagers is more important than the feelings of homosexuals.\"\n \n Though the American scandal is nowhere near played out, it seems likely that the barrage of humiliating revelations and mounting financial losses will force the Vatican to get tough on gay ordinations. To have any hope of being effective, Rome will have to clean house at most American seminaries. This can be done only if local bishops can be trusted to be both loyal to Rome and resolute - and that will happen only if the Vatican forces them to be accountable. \n \n That still leaves the problem of current and future priests who are both homosexual and unchaste. It is true that most of the abuse cases that have reached the public's attention today involve older priests, and the situation in the seminaries has apparently been reined in somewhat from the anything-goes heyday of the 1970s and 1980s. Nevertheless, the problem is still enormous. Most of the cases reported in Goodbye! Good Men involving homosexual corruption date from recent years. One priest who left his seminary teaching post in the mid 1990s in despair over rampant homosexuality - and episcopal indifference to it - told me ominously: \"The things I have seen in my years there are probably previews of coming attractions.\"\n \n A RETURN TO THE FAITH\n The only sensible response, it would seem, is a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to sexual behavior by clergy, even between consenting adults (homosexual and heterosexual). The laity has a role to play as well. In a much-discussed essay in the November 2000 Catholic World Report, the Rev. Paul Shaughnessy, a Jesuit priest, suggested that lay Catholics seeking reform should help keep their priests accountable. He urged lay Catholics to use their checkbooks to fight sexual corruption, by steering their donations away from scandal-ridden dioceses and religious orders, and sending them instead to clean groups like Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity - and then letting the bishop or religious order know what they've done and why. \n \n There is tremendous fear among churchmen that the kind of changes needed to put the Church aright will result in a severe loss of numbers in the priesthood at a time when vocations are already at a historic low. That is probably true in the short run, but the experience of a handful of American dioceses in which the local bishop is openly orthodox and willing to defend Church teaching without compromise gives reason to hope that a strong dose of traditional medicine can go a long way toward curing the Church's ills. \n \n In 1995, Archbishop Elden Curtiss of Omaha published an article pointing out that dioceses that promote rigorous fidelity to Church teaching and practice produce significantly more vocations than do the moderate to liberal majority. Seminaries like Mount Saint Mary's in Emmitsburg, Md. - where men know they will be supported in their authentic Catholic beliefs and practices, and in their commitment to celibacy and chastity - are filled to capacity. \n \n This is not to suggest that the crisis now gripping the Catholic Church in America can be entirely solved by a restoration of rigorously orthodox theology. Another problem that has to be addressed is the clericalist bias seriously afflicting the judgment of many bishops: Even Curtiss himself erred recently, by keeping an Omaha priest in ministry after the priest admitted having a child-pornography problem. But a return to the basics has to be a big part of a comprehensive solution. There is every reason to believe that a conservative reform - replacing dissenting or milquetoast bishops with solid, no-nonsense men; making the seminaries safe places for heterosexuals loyal to Church teaching; and restoring the priesthood to a corps of chaste, faith-filled disciples - would result in a tide of good men seeking holy orders. \n \n This has already been happening in dioceses like Omaha; Lincoln, Neb.; Denver; Peoria, Ill.; Fargo, N.D.; and Arlington, Va. The road map that points the way to an authentic renewal of the Catholic priesthood is being drawn up in those places. And if you want to see the alternative - what would happen if the U.S. Church simply stayed on its current course - just read the morning papers.\n Flashback: Rod Dreher on Catholic Church & Homosexuality on National Review Online\n \n How about it foundit, does your book of gay excuses and talking points tell you how to explain why a higher percentage of priests are dying of AIDS than in the general population? And that's just one shocking statistic this article reveals.\n \n I realize that you will just scream foul and my source is bigoted and homophobic, but the objective observer will be shocked to read the opinions of these honest insiders who dare to speak the truth about the ugly inner workings of the catholic church which has cultivated a culture of militant homosexuality over decades, if not even centuries. :xbanghead",

   "But people who are attracted to children, which is the people WE are referring to, DO NOT CHANGE THEIR SEXUAL PREFERENCES ALL OF A SUDDEN AND MOLEST CHILDREN OF THEIR GENDER WHEN THEY ARE OTHERWISE ATTRACTED TO THE OPPOSITE SEX.\n\n \n Why? Because the hot-blooded straight guy with an adult spouse or girlfriend, shouldn't be able to pass up an eleven year old girl with her large breasts? The point is, children are undeveloped. What attracts an adult to a child, is not the same thing which attracts an adult to another adult. It's a sickness for an adult to be attracted to a child. It is not sexual orientation.\n \n \nFOR YOU HOMOSEXUALS TO ARGUE THAT STRAIGHT MEN ARE SEXUALLY ATTRECTED TO LITTLE BOYS\n\n \n They may happen to be straight in their adult orientation, however their heterosexuality does not attract them to children. The factors are many, such as having the sickness of pedophilia, and opportunity, or anti-social issues. All these are separate from heterosexual orientation. \n \n \nRATHER THAN GIRLS, AND THEN BLAME STRAIGHT MEN FOR ALL OF THE MOLESTING OF ITTLE GIRLS ALSO, ATTEMPTS TO CATEGORIZE ONLY STRAIGHT MEN AS BEING MOLESTERS WHILE COMPLETELY GIVING HOMOSEXUALS A PASS WHEN IT MAKES NO SENSE TO THINK THAT THEY AREN'T THE OBVIOUS SUSPECTS IN BEING ATTRACTED TO BOYS RATHER THAN GIRLS.\n\n \n No, the studies say what they say. Keep in mind that most molestations of girls occur in families. That ties in to the opportunity factor I mentioned. \n \n \nIt absolutely defies reality, yet we live in such a perverse generation, lies like that can be passed off as credible by the PC propagandists who promote these blatant lies which distort human nature in order to bolster the acceptance of homosexuality as not being a sexual abberation.\n \n \n You pre-suppose homosexuality is a sexual abberation. You have no evidence or logic, just as you have neither of those things when you attempt to connect homosexuality to pedophilia. Get a dictionary. \n \n \nNo Jake, I haven't been shown any actual evidence at all. I have been shown some pro homosexual financed studies which paid for specific studies which said what the propagandists wanted them to say in order to try to exonerate homosexuals from being rightly blamed for the vast majority of ALL cases of boyse being molested by men. The only abberation in this sexual practice is when the offenders are straight men.\n\n \n You make claims with absolotely no evidence, and you accuse others of being mere propagandists, again with no evidence that the studies are not credible. Epic fail, Archangel.\n \n \nReally? And you mean the Catholic heirarchy don't you? The authorities who sent these priests to counceling after they got caught and then sent to new parishes where the people didn't know they were getting homosexual child predators as priests?\n\n \n No, actually I didn't meant to imply that. I just meant their religion does not make them an authority to have knowledge on issues such as child molestation or pedophilia, no more than it makes them an authority on heart surgery. \n \n \nAny criticism of what your community represents must be based on prejudice and bigotry and any wrong you are held responsible for as a community must be making you a scapegoat, right?\n\n \n My community is made up of people with a homosexual orientation. It is not represented by pedophilia, child molestation, nor sex crimes. Any suggestion otherwise is bigotry. I'm not saying gay people don't do these things. However, like in the case of heterosexuals I mentioned earlier, they just happenn to be gay. It's not as a logical consequence of homosexuality or heterosexuality.\n \n \nYou are always victims but never responsible for acting out within the nature of what your sexual preference is, huh!\n\n \n Uh-huh. It's not in my nature to sexually molest children.\n \n \nDelusions and denials of reality and the truth is what defines your community, Jake.\n\n \n I think I can speak for myself, as a homosexual, and what defines me, better than you can.",

Cozzens, author of The Changing Face of the Priesthood, on a recent Meet the Press.\n \n The reluctance arises, no doubt, partly out of a fear of antagonizing homosexual anti-defamation groups, who resent the stereotype of male homosexuals as pederasts. It's much safer to focus inquiry on the question of mandatory celibacy, or the issue of ordaining women. Yet it defies common sense to imagine that an ordinary man, having made a vow not to marry, is therefore going to be sexually attracted to boys. Indeed, suppose the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s had admitted married men to the ranks of the Catholic priesthood: Would a single adolescent boy molested over the past 40 years have escaped his fate? Similarly, if women had been ordained, would that somehow have made sexually predatory gay priests disappear?\n \n No, this is chiefly a scandal about unchaste or criminal homosexuals in the Catholic priesthood, and about far too many in Church leadership disinclined to deal with the problem &#8212; or, worse, who may in some cases be actively involved in the misconduct. For Catholics, to start asking questions about homosexuality in the priesthood is to risk finding out more than many Church members prefer to know. For journalists, to confront the issue is to risk touching the electrified third rail of American popular culture: the dark side of homosexuality. Yet when we learn that the greatest crisis the Catholic Church in America has ever faced has been brought upon it almost wholly by male clerics seducing boys, attention must be paid to the man behind the curtain.\n \n It is true that a great many gay people are sickened and appalled by what these wicked priests have done to boys, and some with a public voice, like journalist Andrew Sullivan, have vigorously denounced it. At the same time, Sullivan has strongly supported the ministry of gay priests. \n \n How many gay priests are there? No one can say with certainty; the American bishops have never formally studied the issue, and, for obvious reasons, it is all but impossible to determine an accurate number. Richard Sipe, a laicized priest and psychotherapist who has studied the phenomenon of priests and sex abuse for most of his 40-year career, believes 20 percent of Catholic priests are homosexual, and that half of those are sexually active. In his book, Fr. Cozzens cites various studies putting the total much higher, but these surveys typically suffer from methodological problems that skew the numbers upward.\n \n But those who lowball the numbers could equally be accused of wanting to downplay the problem. The Rev. C. John McCloskey, a member of the conservative Opus Dei organization, claimed recently that the number of gay priests is \"two percent to four percent at a maximum,\" or equivalent to the estimated number of homosexuals in the general population; if that were true, however, it would be hard to explain why, according to experts, Catholic priests are dying of AIDS at a higher rate than males in the general population. \n \n THE LAVENDER MAFIA\n The raw numbers are less important, though, if homosexual priests occupy positions of influence in the vast Catholic bureaucracy; and there seems little doubt that this is the case in the American Church. Lest this be dismissed as right-wing paranoia, it bears noting that psychotherapist Sipe is no conservative &#8212; indeed, he is disliked by many on the Catholic Right for his vigorous dissent from Church teaching on sexual morality &#8212; yet he is convinced that the sexual abuse of minors is facilitated by a secret, powerful network of gay priests. Sipe has a great deal of clinical and research experience in this field; he has reviewed thousands of case histories of sexually active priests and abuse victims. He is convinced of the existence of what the Rev. Andrew Greeley, the left-wing clerical gadfly, has called a \"lavender Mafia.\"\n \n \"This is a system. This is a whole community. You have many good people covering it up,\" Sipe says. \"There is a network of power. A lot of seminary rectors and teachers are part of it, and they move to chancery-office positions, and on to bishoprics. It's part of the ladder of success. It breaks your heart to see the people who suffer because of this.\"\n \n In his new book, Goodbye! Good Men, Michael S. Rose documents in shocking detail how pervasive militant homosexuality is in many seminaries, how much gay sex is taking place among seminarians and priest-professors, and how gay power cliques exclude and punish heterosexuals who oppose them. \"It's not just a few guys in a few seminaries that have an ax to grind. It is a pattern,\" says Rose. \"The protective network [of homosexual priests] begins in the seminaries.\"\n \n The stories related in Rose's book will strike many as incredible, but they track closely with the stories that priests have told me about open gay sex and gay politicking in seminaries. The current scandal is opening Catholic eyes: As one ex-seminarian says, \"People thought I was crazy when I told them what it was like there, so I finally quit talking about it. They're starting to see now that I wasn't.\"\n \n Goodbye! Good Men links homosexuality among priests with theological dissent, a connection commonly made by conservative Catholics who wonder why their parish priests have practically abandoned teaching and explaining Catholic sexual morality. But one veteran vocations-team member for a conservative diocese cautions that Catholics should not assume that theological orthodoxy guarantees heterosexuality or chastity. \"You find [active homosexuality] among some pretty conservative orders, and in places you'd not expect it,\" he says. \"That's what makes this so depressing. You don't know where to turn.\"\n \n An especially nasty aspect of this phenomenon is the vulnerability of sexually active gay priests and bishops to manipulation via blackmail. Priests, psychiatrists, and other informed parties say they encounter this constantly. \"It's the secrecy,\" says Stephen Rubino. \"If you're a bishop and you're having a relationship, and people know about it, are you compromised on dealing with sexually abusive priests? You bet you are. I've seen it happen.\"\n \n Longtime observers predict that in the coming weeks, bishops and priests will be forced to resign under fire after their closeted homosexual lives, including sexual abuse, become public. The disgraced pederast former bishop of Palm Beach, Fla., is probably not alone. If this happens, the Vatican will face mounting pressure from the Catholic rank-and-file to take action. As Fr. Greeley has written, \"The laity, I suspect, would say it is one thing to accept a homosexual priest and quite another to accept a substantially homosexual clergy, many of whom are blatantly part of the gay subculture.\"\n \n Rome has explicitly discouraged the ordination of homosexuals since at least 1961. For the past decade, the Vatican has been ratcheting up the pressure against gay ordination &#8212; to little avail in most U.S. dioceses. Last year, Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone, a top Vatican official, said gays should not be admitted to seminaries, a line that was reinforced in early March by the Pope's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls. Recent reports indicate that the Vatican may soon release another document to restate and clarify this policy.\n \n Today, those who defend allowing homosexuals into the priesthood point to the Church's official teaching, which distinguishes between homosexual orientation (which the Church does not consider sinful) and homosexual acts (which the Catechism labels \"grave depravity\"). There is nothing wrong, the argument goes, with ordaining a homosexually oriented man committed to living chastely and to upholding the Church's teaching on sexuality. Surely there are many such faithful priests in service. \n \n This argument, though, seems persuasive only under conditions far removed from those under which priests have to live today. We now have a culture in which there is little support for chastity, even from within the ranks of the Catholic priesthood. Conservative theologian Michael Novak says he is not prepared to argue for the exclusion of homosexuals from ordination, but as an ex-seminarian, he strongly believes gays should not be on seminary faculties, directing the formation in chastity of young men. Other Catholics who are more liberal than Novak on many Church issues go further on the question of gay ordination: Sipe believes gays shouldn't be admitted into seminaries at the present time &#8212; for their own protection, against sexual predators among the faculty and administration, who will attempt to draw them into a priestly subculture in which gay sex is normative behavior. Fr. Thomas P. Doyle, another critic of celibacy who has been deeply involved in the clergy-abuse issue, concurs: \"Ordaining gay men at this time would be putting them, no matter how good and dedicated, in a precarious position.\"\n \n No one wants to stigmatize homosexuals as abusers, because most of them are not. Still, it's hard to gainsay the contention that if there were few homosexuals in the priesthood, the number of sex-abuse victims today would be drastically lower. \"We're learning a significant lesson from all this,\" says Dr. Fitzgibbons. \"We have to protect our young. The protection of children and teenagers is more important than the feelings of homosexuals.\"\n \n Though the American scandal is nowhere near played out, it seems likely that the barrage of humiliating revelations and mounting financial losses will force the Vatican to get tough on gay ordinations. To have any hope of being effective, Rome will have to clean house at most American seminaries. This can be done only if local bishops can be trusted to be both loyal to Rome and resolute &#8212; and that will happen only if the Vatican forces them to be accountable. \n \n That still leaves the problem of current and future priests who are both homosexual and unchaste. It is true that most of the abuse cases that have reached the public's attention today involve older priests, and the situation in the seminaries has apparently been reined in somewhat from the anything-goes heyday of the 1970s and 1980s. Nevertheless, the problem is still enormous. Most of the cases reported in Goodbye! Good Men involving homosexual corruption date from recent years. One priest who left his seminary teaching post in the mid 1990s in despair over rampant homosexuality &#8212; and episcopal indifference to it &#8212; told me ominously: \"The things I have seen in my years there are probably previews of coming attractions.\"\n \n A RETURN TO THE FAITH\n The only sensible response, it would seem, is a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to sexual behavior by clergy, even between consenting adults (homosexual and heterosexual). The laity has a role to play as well. In a much-discussed essay in the November 2000 Catholic World Report, the Rev. Paul Shaughnessy, a Jesuit priest, suggested that lay Catholics seeking reform should help keep their priests accountable. He urged lay Catholics to use their checkbooks to fight sexual corruption, by steering their donations away from scandal-ridden dioceses and religious orders, and sending them instead to clean groups like Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity &#8212; and then letting the bishop or religious order know what they've done and why. \n \n There is tremendous fear among churchmen that the kind of changes needed to put the Church aright will result in a severe loss of numbers in the priesthood at a time when vocations are already at a historic low. That is probably true in the short run, but the experience of a handful of American dioceses in which the local bishop is openly orthodox and willing to defend Church teaching without compromise gives reason to hope that a strong dose of traditional medicine can go a long way toward curing the Church's ills. \n \n In 1995, Archbishop Elden Curtiss of Omaha published an article pointing out that dioceses that promote rigorous fidelity to Church teaching and practice produce significantly more vocations than do the moderate to liberal majority. Seminaries like Mount Saint Mary's in Emmitsburg, Md. &#8212; where men know they will be supported in their authentic Catholic beliefs and practices, and in their commitment to celibacy and chastity &#8212; are filled to capacity. \n \n This is not to suggest that the crisis now gripping the Catholic Church in America can be entirely solved by a restoration of rigorously orthodox theology. Another problem that has to be addressed is the clericalist bias seriously afflicting the judgment of many bishops: Even Curtiss himself erred recently, by keeping an Omaha priest in ministry after the priest admitted having a child-pornography problem. But a return to the basics has to be a big part of a comprehensive solution. There is every reason to believe that a conservative reform &#8212; replacing dissenting or milquetoast bishops with solid, no-nonsense men; making the seminaries safe places for heterosexuals loyal to Church teaching; and restoring the priesthood to a corps of chaste, faith-filled disciples &#8212; would result in a tide of good men seeking holy orders. \n \n This has already been happening in dioceses like Omaha; Lincoln, Neb.; Denver; Peoria, Ill.; Fargo, N.D.; and Arlington, Va. The road map that points the way to an authentic renewal of the Catholic priesthood is being drawn up in those places. And if you want to see the alternative &#8212; what would happen if the U.S. Church simply stayed on its current course &#8212; just read the morning papers.\n Flashback: Rod Dreher on Catholic Church & Homosexuality on National Review Online\n \n How about it foundit, does your book of gay excuses and talking points tell you how to explain why a higher percentage of priests are dying of AIDS than in the general population? And that's just one shocking statistic this article reveals.\n \n I realize that you will just scream foul and my source is bigoted and homophobic, but the objective observer will be shocked to read the opinions of these honest insiders who dare to speak the truth about the ugly inner workings of the catholic church which has cultivated a culture of militant homosexuality over decades, if not even centuries. :xbanghead\n\n \n The author is simply asking why this is, that most of the victims are boys. He offers no evidence that the abusers are gay. The answer could be that there is more opportunity, to commit the crime, since the priests are in contact so much with the alter boys. The author then has the gall to conclude that there would be fewer molestations if there were fewer gay priests. Again, no evidence or reasoning is given as to why that is. It's just pre-supposed, according to the author, to be \"common sense\". It's hardly a shock that with homophobia in the church, gay people are forced into the closet, or subject to blackmail. That's not the fault of the gay community. Gay people exist in all walks of life.",

   "Blah blah blah. The same old denials and excuses as you lash out that anyone who rejects your lies just has to be a homophobe and a bigot.\n\n I didn't call anybody a homophobe or a bigot in my post.\n Your replies are consistently whining about things that aren't happening. You paint yourself as a victim, ignoring what people are REALLY saying.\n \n \n \nWell I'm not alone in my observations foundit, and here is why your lies and denials stick.\n\n Archie, there is a HUGE difference between you having company in telling your lies about gays, and having those lies NOT be lies.\n I acknowledge that.\n There are also people that tell lies about Jews and blacks, claiming they commit all sorts of crimes they are not responsible for.\n The existence of these people does not lend credence to their lies.\n \n \n \nThe Gay Question\n Amid the Catholic Church's current scandals, an unignorable issue.\n By Rod Dreher, from the April 22, 2002, issue of National Review\n he first thing to understand about the Catholic Church's pedophilia scandal is that it is not technically a pedophilia scandal. Despite the gruesome example of defrocked Boston priest John Geoghan, whose case started the current tidal wave of revelations, the overwhelming majority of priests who have molested minors are not pedophiles - that is, like Geoghan, among the rare adults sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children. They are, rather, \"ephebophiles\" - adults who are sexually attracted to post-pubescent youths, generally aged 12 to 17. And their victims have been almost exclusively boys. \n\n Archie, it is actually hilarious that you try to use the catholic church as a credible resource on this.\n THEY HAVE BEEN LYING for decades now, covering up the problem illegally. And now, when they try to give a scape-goat you swallow it hook, line, and sinker.\n \n The Catholic church has never come completely clean on the issue. We have no idea of how many victims they paid off that we don't know about.\n Their actions are reprehensible and not indicative of honesty. Once again, you believe whoever says something you like, ignoring the bigger picture.\n \n The female victims are out there too. Nobody really knows how many victims exist or what their gender tallies are.\n Women's eNews - Five Women Sue Mass. Diocese for Priest's Abuse\n Geoghan Finally sentenced\n \n If the Catholic Church has any success at all in defining sex abuse by priests as a gay problem, it is because the public has revoltingly short memories. It was only last year that the National Catholic Reporter, an independent U.S. journal, published groundbreaking stories detailing the rape of nuns in Africa by heterosexual priests, and the Catholic hierarchy's all too familiar response of burying accusations, denying the problem, and protecting the priests.\n \n NCR's story focused on a 1994 report produced by medical missionary, Maura O'Donohue, a physician, who based her findings on six years as AIDS coordinator for the London-based Catholic Fund for Overseas Development.\n \n Typical of the report was a Malawi diocese where the local priests had impregnated 29 sisters. When the Mother Superior complained in 1988, she was relieved of her duties. In another instance elsewhere, a priest responsible for impregnating a nun and forcing her into a fatal abortion attempt, later officiated at her funeral Mass. \n The GULLY | Priests' Forgotten Victims\n \n \n \nStephen Rubino, a New Jersey lawyer, says that of the over 300 alleged victims of priest sex abuse he has represented, roughly 85 percent are boys, and were teenagers when the abuse occurred. Dr. Richard Fitzgibbons, an eminent Catholic psychiatrist who has treated scores of victims and priest-perpetrators, says 90 percent of his patients were either teen male victims of priests, or priests who abused teen boys. \n \"I think we have to ask the question: Why are 90 percent to 95 percent, and some estimates say as high as 98 percent, of the victims of clergy [abuse] teenage boys? . . . We need to ask that question, and I think there's a certain reluctance to raise that issue,\" said the Rev. Donald B. Cozzens, author of The Changing Face of the Priesthood, on a recent Meet the Press.\n\n :xbanghead\n :xbanghead\n :xbanghead\n This kind of ignorance is like asking why a pedophile IN AN ALL BOYS SCHOOL didn't molest more girls...\n :xbanghead\n \n The Catholic church is behind the times on gender issues. They put boys as \"priest helpers\" all over the place, AND EXCLUDE GIRLS.\n So when a pedophile has MORE ACCESS to boys, and the church PREVENTS girls from being in those positions, OF COURSE the pedophile is going to molest what is available.\n \n I am amazed that the Catholics try to use their own misogyny as somehow an excuse to blame the gays.\n \n \n \nHow many gay priests are there? No one can say with certainty; the American bishops have never formally studied the issue, and, for obvious reasons, it is all but impossible to determine an accurate number.\n\n On a related issue, people have investigated the prevalence of child molestation amongst catholic church priests, and found it is NO MORE PREVALENT amongst catholic priests than among the rest of society.\n \n The really repulsive thing about the scandal is that the church covered it up, in large quantities. THAT is what makes this so reprehensible above and beyond the actual crime.\n WHY did the Catholic church cover it up? To save face. A deplorable and selfish excuse.\n \n But more to the point, this repudiates any significance to the question being raised here.\n It DOES NOT MATTER how many gays are present in the priesthood!\n 1) Because the actual INCIDENCE of the crimes is no greater than in the non-Catholic world.\n 2) Because REPEATED research articles show that gays are no more likely to molest.\n \n BOTH of those facts are consistent with this situation...\n \n \n Now, on a side-tangent addressing the situation, there is another way that the Catholic church is disgustingly responsible for the very situation they speak out against.\n When the Catholic church fosters a belief that gays can be \"healed\" through prayer, it would make sense for a believing gay Catholic to think \"I am gay. If I go into the priesthood, that will help cure me of my gayness\".\n \n Doesn't work, but the Catholic church has set up its OWN REASON WHY there are more gays (self-hating gays) going into the priesthood.\n \n \n \nTHE LAVENDER MAFIA\n The raw numbers are less important, though, if homosexual priests occupy positions of influence in the vast Catholic bureaucracy; and there seems little doubt that this is the case in the American Church.\n\n I am not surprised that Archie likes this article. It employs his repeated tactic of making statements, assuming them to be true without proof, and then offering no proof while chastising those who ask for proof...\n \n This claim is easily repudiated by a recognition of two scenarios that played out in reality.\n 1) Policy on gays and catholic priests. This policy, excluding gays from catholic priesthood, CAME QUICKLY when the issue was raised.\n If gays were truly in positions of power, they would have fought it.\n \n 2) Policy on pedophiles and catholic priests. This policy should be a no-brainer. If you have a position that has working with children as a regular part of daily process (or any working with children), pedophiles should be prevented from that position.\n Obvious, no-brainer policy!\n But the Catholic church STALLED on implementing this obvious policy.\n When the scandal broke, they QUICKLY tried to scape-goat the gays. They QUICKLY put a policy of \"no gays\" in place.\n But when people asked about a policy of \"no pedophiles\", THEY STALLED on the issue. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Quite frankly, the REAL issue going on here is obvious.\n The Catholic priesthood is at least sympathetic to child molestors, if not more insidious in their relationship. FOR DECADES they have covered up for child molestors, and when an obvious policy should have been implemented, they stalled.\n THAT is the relationship which should be questioned here...\n \n \n \nHow about it foundit, does your book of gay excuses and talking points tell you how to explain why a higher percentage of priests are dying of AIDS than in the general population?\n\n Archie, if you would ever stop trying to overwhelm people with your b.s. and LISTEN you would realize I don't excuse people's promiscuity with abstaining from protection. It's a danger that should NEVER be ignored.\n \n And lo and behold.\n What is so special about CATHOLIC priests?\n Catholicism demands a lack of contraception! Catholicism demands that condoms NOT BE USED.\n Quite frankly, we've seen how this policy plays into making problems worse AROUND THE WORLD. How it makes the spread of AIDS worse in third world countries. How it causes problems with teen-age pregnancy in America.\n The reason for a higher percentage of priests dying of AIDS is because they are not allowed to use condoms.",

Saying something someone BELIEVES is bunk is not disrespectful. That's a judgment call on the view itself. Calling the person ignorant or claiming they've 'suspended intellect' is disrespectful. That's what you've said. Intellect and religion are not juxtaposed to each other. Neither are they inversely proportional. You've not just commented on the claims, you've essentially passed judgment on the claimants.\n \n \nOnce again - - I said I don't respect the beliefs as intellectually valid - I did not say I don't respect the person or his right to belief in anything. Please stop saying that.\n \n \n Then why do you even make it a point to make claims about the person rather than just their views (such your statements about their intellect)? It's not like you've limited yourself here to saying you think the VIEWS are bunk. You've gone out of your way to say things about the people who have those views. If I say I believe atheism is bunk, that's one thing. But if I go farther and say that atheism is a suspension of intellect by the athiest, that's a much farther matter. It would be an attempt to associate atheism with ignorance, which is EXACTLY what you are doing with religion. What you're engaging in is a form of intolerance, period. \n \n \nAnd it's utter BS to say you would be respectful of Zeus worshippers.\n\n \n No, it's not. Believe it or not, some people--I dare say most people--are respectful of religion, Thelmoose. I think you might prefer they weren't, but they are, because people are generally respectful of others' views. Now that's not the same thing as saying they would disagree; they would believe Zeus isn't real. But I think most people would still be respectful, as would I. Now, if those Zeus worshippers started harming people in the name of Zeus, that would be a different story. No longer would they get respect.\n \n \nBelieving in that which is unbelievable defines a lack of intellect.\n\n \n The problem is that \"unbelievable\" is in the eye of the beholder. To billions of people, theism is quite believable. To them, the EVIDENCE suggests there is a God. You interpret the evidence differently. A theist could just come right back and say that because it's unbelievable to believe there is NO God, then you yourself are engaging in a suspension of intellect. So the real problem here is you've chosen to have a lack of respect toward religion. It's a form of prejudice on your part. \n \n \nIt is indeed extremely harmful, creating a society that is gullible, ignorant and distrustful of scientific methods.\n\n \n In point of fact, the amount of people who are accepting the concept of evolution as valid is increasing. So apparently, such a society of horribles is NOT being created; quite the contrary. Furthermore, science doesn't seem to be in any danger in many OTHER areas as a result of that one area. Science in general is not doomed here. More importantly, your claims are so tenuous that it's the sort of thing for which one could stretch ANYTHING to say it's \"harmful\". We can't define harm as a society based just on what our opinion is of the way society should THINK. People aren't going to die or be injured from believing in ID. Nor is there emotional scarring involved in such a thing.\n \n From the link ....\n \"The problem is, there are a number of fundamental people on both the left and the right extremes,\" said Michael Zimmerman, founder of the Clergy Letter Project, which seeks to find common ground between scientists and the clergy.\n \n \"Most people think you can't believe in evolution and have faith,\" added Zimmerman, a dean at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana. \"Faith does not mean that you have to give up common sense. Faith is deeper than that.\"I think that pretty much says it all.",

   "Like I said in post 82 foundit, I realize that you will just scream foul and say my source is bigoted and homophobic, but the objective observer will be shocked to read the opinions of these honest insiders who dare to speak the truth about the ugly inner workings of the catholic church which has cultivated a culture of militant homosexuality over decades, if not even centuries. Your denials and attacks on the facts in that article do nothing to minimize the message it sends. emoticon_xgood\n \n Facts like these are undeniable, yet you will deny them anyway.\n Stephen Rubino, a New Jersey lawyer, says that of the over 300 alleged victims of priest sex abuse he has represented, roughly 85 percent are boys, and were teenagers when the abuse occurred. Dr. Richard Fitzgibbons, an eminent Catholic psychiatrist who has treated scores of victims and priest-perpetrators, says 90 percent of his patients were either teen male victims of priests, or priests who abused teen boys. \n \n \"I think we have to ask the question: Why are 90 percent to 95 percent, and some estimates say as high as 98 percent, of the victims of clergy [abuse] teenage boys? . . . We need to ask that question, and I think there's a certain reluctance to raise that issue,\" said the Rev. Donald B. Cozzens, author of The Changing Face of the Priesthood, on a recent Meet the Press.\n \n The reluctance arises, no doubt, partly out of a fear of antagonizing homosexual anti-defamation groups, who resent the stereotype of male homosexuals as pederasts. It's much safer to focus inquiry on the question of mandatory celibacy, or the issue of ordaining women. Yet it defies common sense to imagine that an ordinary man, having made a vow not to marry, is therefore going to be sexually attracted to boys. Indeed, suppose the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s had admitted married men to the ranks of the Catholic priesthood: Would a single adolescent boy molested over the past 40 years have escaped his fate? Similarly, if women had been ordained, would that somehow have made sexually predatory gay priests disappear?\n \n No, this is chiefly a scandal about unchaste or criminal homosexuals in the Catholic priesthood, and about far too many in Church leadership disinclined to deal with the problem - or, worse, who may in some cases be actively involved in the misconduct. For Catholics, to start asking questions about homosexuality in the priesthood is to risk finding out more than many Church members prefer to know. For journalists, to confront the issue is to risk touching the electrified third rail of American popular culture: the dark side of homosexuality. Yet when we learn that the greatest crisis the Catholic Church in America has ever faced has been brought upon it almost wholly by male clerics seducing boys, attention must be paid to the man behind the curtain.AND THESE:Richard Sipe, a laicized priest and psychotherapist who has studied the phenomenon of priests and sex abuse for most of his 40-year career, believes 20 percent of Catholic priests are homosexual, and that half of those are sexually active. In his book, Fr. Cozzens cites various studies putting the total much higher, but these surveys typically suffer from methodological problems that skew the numbers upward.\n \n But those who lowball the numbers could equally be accused of wanting to downplay the problem. The Rev. C. John McCloskey, a member of the conservative Opus Dei organization, claimed recently that the number of gay priests is \"two percent to four percent at a maximum,\" or equivalent to the estimated number of homosexuals in the general population; [B]if that were true, however, it would be hard to explain why, according to experts, Catholic priests are dying of AIDS at a higher rate than males in the general population.[B] OR THIS:THE LAVENDER MAFIA\n The raw numbers are less important, though, if homosexual priests occupy positions of influence in the vast Catholic bureaucracy; and there seems little doubt that this is the case in the American Church. Lest this be dismissed as right-wing paranoia, it bears noting that psychotherapist Sipe is no conservative - indeed, he is disliked by many on the Catholic Right for his vigorous dissent from Church teaching on sexual morality - yet he is convinced that the sexual abuse of minors is facilitated by a secret, powerful network of gay priests. Sipe has a great deal of clinical and research experience in this field; he has reviewed thousands of case histories of sexually active priests and abuse victims. He is convinced of the existence of what the Rev. Andrew Greeley, the left-wing clerical gadfly, has called a \"lavender Mafia.\"\n \n \"This is a system. This is a whole community. You have many good people covering it up,\" Sipe says. \"There is a network of power. A lot of seminary rectors and teachers are part of it, and they move to chancery-office positions, and on to bishoprics. It's part of the ladder of success. It breaks your heart to see the people who suffer because of this.\"\n \n In his new book, Goodbye! Good Men, Michael S. Rose documents in shocking detail how pervasive militant homosexuality is in many seminaries, how much gay sex is taking place among seminarians and priest-professors, and how gay power cliques exclude and punish heterosexuals who oppose them. \"It's not just a few guys in a few seminaries that have an ax to grind. It is a pattern,\" says Rose. \"The protective network [of homosexual priests] begins in the seminaries.\"\n \n The stories related in Rose's book will strike many as incredible, but they track closely with the stories that priests have told me about open gay sex and gay politicking in seminaries. The current scandal is opening Catholic eyes: As one ex-seminarian says, \"People thought I was crazy when I told them what it was like there, so I finally quit talking about it. They're starting to see now that I wasn't.\"\n \n Goodbye! Good Men links homosexuality among priests with theological dissent, a connection commonly made by conservative Catholics who wonder why their parish priests have practically abandoned teaching and explaining Catholic sexual morality. But one veteran vocations-team member for a conservative diocese cautions that Catholics should not assume that theological orthodoxy guarantees heterosexuality or chastity. \"You find [active homosexuality] among some pretty conservative orders, and in places you'd not expect it,\" he says. \"That's what makes this so depressing. You don't know where to turn.\"\n \n An especially nasty aspect of this phenomenon is the vulnerability of sexually active gay priests and bishops to manipulation via blackmail. Priests, psychiatrists, and other informed parties say they encounter this constantly. \"It's the secrecy,\" says Stephen Rubino. \"If you're a bishop and you're having a relationship, and people know about it, are you compromised on dealing with sexually abusive priests? You bet you are. I've seen it happen.\"\n \n Longtime observers predict that in the coming weeks, bishops and priests will be forced to resign under fire after their closeted homosexual lives, including sexual abuse, become public. The disgraced pederast former bishop of Palm Beach, Fla., is probably not alone. If this happens, the Vatican will face mounting pressure from the Catholic rank-and-file to take action. As Fr. Greeley has written, \"The laity, I suspect, would say it is one thing to accept a homosexual priest and quite another to accept a substantially homosexual clergy, many of whom are blatantly part of the gay subculture.\"\n \n Rome has explicitly discouraged the ordination of homosexuals since at least 1961. For the past decade, the Vatican has been ratcheting up the pressure against gay ordination - to little avail in most U.S. dioceses. Last year, Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone, a top Vatican official, said gays should not be admitted to seminaries, a line that was reinforced in early March by the Pope's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls. Recent reports indicate that the Vatican may soon release another document to restate and clarify this policy.\n \n Today, those who defend allowing homosexuals into the priesthood point to the Church's official teaching, which distinguishes between homosexual orientation (which the Church does not consider sinful) and homosexual acts (which the Catechism labels \"grave depravity\"). There is nothing wrong, the argument goes, with ordaining a homosexually oriented man committed to living chastely and to upholding the Church's teaching on sexuality. Surely there are many such faithful priests in service. \n \n This argument, though, seems persuasive only under conditions far removed from those under which priests have to live today. We now have a culture in which there is little support for chastity, even from within the ranks of the Catholic priesthood. Conservative theologian Michael Novak says he is not prepared to argue for the exclusion of homosexuals from ordination, but as an ex-seminarian, he strongly believes gays should not be on seminary faculties, directing the formation in chastity of young men. Other Catholics who are more liberal than Novak on many Church issues go further on the question of gay ordination: Sipe believes gays shouldn't be admitted into seminaries at the present time - for their own protection, against sexual predators among the faculty and administration, who will attempt to draw them into a priestly subculture in which gay sex is normative behavior. Fr. Thomas P. Doyle, another critic of celibacy who has been deeply involved in the clergy-abuse issue, concurs: \"Ordaining gay men at this time would be putting them, no matter how good and dedicated, in a precarious position.\"\n \n No one wants to stigmatize homosexuals as abusers, because most of them are not. Still, it's hard to gainsay the contention that if there were few homosexuals in the priesthood, the number of sex-abuse victims today would be drastically lower. \"We're learning a significant lesson from all this,\" says Dr. Fitzgibbons. \"We have to protect our young. The protection of children and teenagers is more important than the feelings of homosexuals.\"\n \n Though the American scandal is nowhere near played out, it seems likely that the barrage of humiliating revelations and mounting financial losses will force the Vatican to get tough on gay ordinations. To have any hope of being effective, Rome will have to clean house at most American seminaries. This can be done only if local bishops can be trusted to be both loyal to Rome and resolute - and that will happen only if the Vatican forces them to be accountable. \n \n That still leaves the problem of current and future priests who are both homosexual and unchaste. It is true that most of the abuse cases that have reached the public's attention today involve older priests, and the situation in the seminaries has apparently been reined in somewhat from the anything-goes heyday of the 1970s and 1980s. Nevertheless, the problem is still enormous. Most of the cases reported in Goodbye! Good Men involving homosexual corruption date from recent years. One priest who left his seminary teaching post in the mid 1990s in despair over rampant homosexuality - and episcopal indifference to it - told me ominously: \"The things I have seen in my years there are probably previews of coming attractions.\"",

   "No, you clearly still don't understand. Saying something someone BELIEVES is bunk is not disrespectful. That's a judgment call on the view itself. Calling the person ignorant or claiming they've 'suspended intellect' is disrespectful. That's what you've said. Intellect and religion are not juxtaposed to each other. Neither are they inversely proportional. You've not just commented on the claims, you've essentially passed judgment on the claimants. \n\n \n What you profess does not make sense, has no evidence to back it up and requires this thing to faith to believe it. Those are the facts. If you think the facts are offensive, you only have yourself to blame.\n \n \n \nThen why do you even make it a point to make claims about the person rather than just their views (such your statements about their intellect)? It's not like you've limited yourself here to saying you think the VIEWS are bunk. You've gone out of your way to say things about the people who have those views. If I say I believe atheism is bunk, that's one thing. But if I go farther and say that atheism is a suspension of intellect by the athiest, that's a much farther matter. It would be an attempt to associate atheism with ignorance, which is EXACTLY what you are doing with religion. What you're engaging in is a form of intolerance, period. \n\n \n If one's views are illogical or require magical thinking or are bunk, that reflects on their intellect. Can't separate the two. I can't know your thoughts except by your communication of them - your views are the direct manifestation of your thought processes. If your views are stupid...\n \n \n \n \n \n \nNo, it's not. Believe it or not, some people--I dare say most people--are respectful of religion, Thelmoose. I think you might prefer they weren't, but they are, because people are generally respectful of others' views. Now that's not the same thing as saying they would disagree; they would believe Zeus isn't real. But I think most people would still be respectful, as would I. Now, if those Zeus worshippers started harming people in the name of Zeus, that would be a different story. No longer would they get respect.\n\n \n Feh. Don't believe you. Zeusists would be the subject of ridicule. It's a hypothetical, of course, but come on now, get real.\n \n \nThe problem is that \"unbelievable\" is in the eye of the beholder. To billions of people, theism is quite believable. To them, the EVIDENCE suggests there is a God. You interpret the evidence differently. A theist could just come right back and say that because it's unbelievable to believe there is NO God, then you yourself are engaging in a suspension of intellect. So the real problem here is you've chosen to have a lack of respect toward religion. It's a form of prejudice on your part. \n\n \n By unbelievable, I mean by those terms with which we label everything else as unbelievable. It is not in the eye of the beholder. Religious beliefs are just as incredible as any other fairy tale, but we affored them special reverence the religious ask us to. \n \n If you have any evidence that doesn't require circular thinking, I am listening. Neither you nor any one else in the history of humankind has been able to provide that.\n \n \n\n In point of fact, the amount of people who are accepting the concept of evolution as valid is increasing. So apparently, such a society of horribles is NOT being created; quite the contrary. Furthermore, science doesn't seem to be in any danger in many OTHER areas as a result of that one area. Science in general is not doomed here. More importantly, your claims are so tenuous that it's the sort of thing for which one could stretch ANYTHING to say it's \"harmful\". We can't define harm as a society based just on what our opinion is of the way society should THINK. People aren't going to die or be injured from believing in ID. Nor is there emotional scarring involved in such a thing.\n \n From the link ....\n \"The problem is, there are a number of fundamental people on both the left and the right extremes,\" said Michael Zimmerman, founder of the Clergy Letter Project, which seeks to find common ground between scientists and the clergy.\n \n \"Most people think you can't believe in evolution and have faith,\" added Zimmerman, a dean at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana. \"Faith does not mean that you have to give up common sense. Faith is deeper than that.\"I think that pretty much says it all.\n\n \n Last comment, now you're getting too ridiculous. \n \n If more people are accepting the concept of evolution, that is not because of religion's urgings. The religious fight this - they are the ONLY ones who do. Two thirds of the US doesn't believe in evolution and think the earth is less than 10K years old. Are you even remotely suggest that this fact is not sad and frightening?\n \n The link is absurd - has opinions the clergy and of the Discovery Institute. What else are these people gonna say? \n \n And that insipid little quote about faith is exactly the thing that people who use faith MUST tell themselves so they are can retain any self-respect and can go on buying the malarkey.\n \n To finish, here are some quotes about religious faith and how is undeservedly celebrated, which was the point of this thread, from Sam Harris.\n \n \nWhere we have reason for what we believe, we have no need of faith; where we have no reasons, we have lost both our connection to the world and to one another. People who harbor strong convictions without evidence belong at the margins of our societies, not in our halls of power.\n\n \n \nThere are sources of irrationality other than religious faith, of course, but none of them are celebrated for their role in shaping public policy. Supreme Court justices are not in the habit of praising our nation or its reliance upon astrology, or for its wealth of UFO sightings, or for exemplifying the various reasoning biases that psychologists have found to be more or less endemic to our species. Only mainstream religious dogmatism receives the unqualified support of government. And yet, religious faith obscures uncertainty where uncertainty manifestly exists, allowing the unknown, the implausible, and the patently false to achieve primacy over facts.\n \n \n",

And how do you get that distinction from the passage I posted? \n \n \nThe fact that Christians look at \"homosexuality\" as a spiritual issue is one thing.\n Blaming it on [B][U][COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;][SIZE=&quot;6&quot;]DEMONS and invoking an [B][U][COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;][SIZE=&quot;6&quot;]EXORCISM is quite another.\n \n And thus, Archie places himself firmly in the \"exorcism\" camp...\n I am not surprised...\n\n \n Actually, NO! Nowhere on this thread have I endorsed exorcism for homosexuality. I have only defended exorcism as a legitimate tool for evicting demons from possessed people. I believe that just getting saved and receiving the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is sufficient for defeating the sins of the flesh which oppress the unsaved such as homosexuality and other types of sexual immorality which afflict heterosexuals.",

Then that statement was in context to the discussion at the time. And I probably posted this same verse as evidence of what I was saying too. \n \n All I am doing today is expanding that statement to say that it isn't only homosexuality which is the result of demonic influence but many areas of sin. There are demons of lust, violence, homosexuality, murder, rape, sadism, torture and every other conceivable sin which man commits. Ours is a spiritual battle which can only be defeated with spiritual tools. \n \n You are free to disagree with me if you like, but don't make this belief about focusing only on homosexuals when sin of every type is a universal problem with humanity.\n Eph 6:12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual {forces} of wickedness in the heavenly {places.} [/QUOTE]",
