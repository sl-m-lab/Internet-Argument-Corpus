I think that one very unfair claim that I hear over and over, though, is that America has the best health care system in the world. This is true only if you can afford it. Because Bill Gates gets the best treatment possible does not prove, I believe, that our system is better for me. Also curious to the argument of our system being the best is that nobody else in the world seems to want it.

   "Hey im from Canada and our national Health care is a crock!\n First off, waiting lines are massive, technology is lacking, quality is lacking, we are losing doctors to the USA because you guys pay them what they deserve, and because of that we are losing family doctors fast. \n \n Canadians Pride themselves on this government funded program because it's all they know. The liberals have imbedded into the Canadian public that it is the Canadian way to support Public Health care, and that private; even a two tier system is the devil. Why do they do this? because Health care cost roughly 15% of Canada's GDP Canada's highest expense next to the national debt. \n \n Even though it's accessible to everyone, what good is it really if it sucks?\n \n Personally right now I Favour a Two Tier system, where people get what they pay for, and can shop around for the best coverage and services, and or those you desperately need it who can't afford to have a cast for their own child or something like that, then the government helps them. But im strongly open to a Purely Private system, I just need someone to explain to me how it would work. \n \n I just have one question. What kind of a system does America really have? Is it Two Tier or strictly Private? And how exactly does it work?\n\n \n Totally agree.

   "Am an American living/working/married in Germany.\n \n Had an expensive (self-paid) plan with Blue-Cross and now have government sponsored health care here in Germany. Germany is by far better.... cheaper and much easier access.\n \n I'm sorry, but all this criticism of \"long-lines\" from socialized medicine is just not so. Thinking about all the weeks I had to wait to get to see a doctor in the states.... OK, when I show up to the office there's no line, but the appointments took forever to make. Here, I just walk in when I need something, and usually never wait more than 10 or 15 minutes. \n \n Biggest differences I have noticed is cost and access. I had a mild heart attack in the states and had 2 unnecessary stents put in. I had to pay 5-6K on top of my monthly premium. If that happened here, I would only have paid 10 Euro a night for the hospital. Nothing else. Thinking about the co-pay centric system in the states is just mind-boggling. I pay only 10 Euro per quarter for any doctor I see! Meds are included unless it's very expensive, then I may have to pay and extra 5 Euro.\n \n I know there are wonderful doctors in the US, but their need to make money to cover the hideous costs of mal-practice insurance as well as the medical dictates from the actuaries working for the evil insurance companies hold back the true nature of why the doctors become doctors. It is now all about making enough money to survive and then the human greed takes over. Can the ineffectual managerial abilities of the US government actually handle such a daunting task? I don't have much confidence, at least in this administration and congress.\n \n Something has to be done. America is FAR from being \"#1\". Healthcare is a basic human right.",

   "Many of the opposing arguments to health reform have flaws, which when examined more thoroughly, support the case for health reform.\n \n Typical example listed as an sign of good U.S. health care:\n \"At age 80, when most people are highly dependent on the health-care system, Americans have the longest life expectancy (7.1 years for men, 9.0 for women) in the world.\"  That information, if analyzed against the context of the entire longevity data plus medical understanding, shows how poor access to good health care is. Why? Because at age 60 the U.S. has the lowest remaining life expectancy, since all the people who had chronic diseases are either already dead or dying. By age 80, they are mostly gone. Early intervention to educate at-risk populations and begin treatment of the more damaging aspects of these chronic diseases delays morbity, reduces complications thereof and ultimately improves longevity. It is an argument for reform to improve health care access of at-risk patients, not a proof of wellness of the system. \n \n Interpretive flaws, like that pointed out above, occur repeatedly in opponent's arguments suggesting either cherry-picking of facts, or just plain superficiality in thought. I suspect the the former since this issue is strongly partisan. So I did some research on the health care issue myself, and I found information suggesting the health care problem may even be understated. The arguments against reform implicitly lean on one underlying principle, a keystone which makes their flawed analyses remotely understandable: i.e. that no one has the legal right to health care. Given that this position is on shaky ethical ground in most people's minds, reform opposition debate usually ends up being cluttered with evidence factually true but interpretively false, or debate is diverted to their own anecdotal counter-horror stories.\n \n To examine the arguments against reform, I watched the internet videos of opponents, like Stuart Browning, who has his own view under titles like \"Dead Meat\" and \"A Short Course in Brain Surgery\". After watching them, none of those stories really struck me as being worse than what happens in the U.S. all the time also, -- like that lady who died waiting on the floor of an emergency room last week in L.A. Or those 3 doctors arrested in California about a year ago who performed $30 million in totally unnecessary surgeries on hundreds of patients. If that is not bad health care, I don't know what is. For some reason opponents forget that overtreatment can be just as bad for people's health as waiting too long.\n \n Moreover, after some careful thought, I also realized Browning's defense of U.S. health care supported reform much better than it supported keeping the existing problems intact. Notions that \"free\" emergency room treatment is adequate for the uninsured were among the most obvious blunders. Any experienced doctor can tell you that is a joke, and even their own narrator said treatment for the uninsured was only 50-60% the quality of insured patients. Uh-huh. That must be why twice as many uninsured children die in hospitals compared to a similar control group of insured children in hospitals. \n \n Moreover, almost all opponents to health reform limit their definition of \"quality of care\" short-sightedly, and also fail to cite the obvious economic barriers to health care in the U.S. which is in many ways worse than the waiting list delays. If a person dies simply because they can not afford a \"high quality of care\", then I would argue the value of that quality is negated. And I can say with 100% certainty no one would argue with that assessment if it happened to them. Really. Access to care, including economic and bureaucratic barriers then, is a parameter of the definition of the quality of care, and it is inseparable from success rates. Access affects success. And I would much rather wait than have no care at all.\n \n In summary: the proponents of \"no right to health care\" want the nation to develop intolerance for compassion and cheerfully embrace being a jerk: to see growing income inequality as a opportunity to force an ever-increasing proportion of our nation to go uninsured, or become inadequately insured, and hence risk bankruptcy with unexpected health emergencies. In short, opponents of reform want ever larger numbers of us to play Russian roulette and love it. Businessweek two days ago reported only 40% of Americans liked the U.S. health care system, while 65% of the French said they were happy about theirs. That means 60% of us already know the system is broken.\n \n \n -------------------------------------------------\n a few statistics:\n \n U.S. Health Care Costs\n ======================================\n In 1999 500,000 declared personal bankrupcy because of medical bills (inadequate insurance)\n A Harvard study found that 50% of all U.S. bankruptcies can be attributed to medical bills\n \n In 2005 42 million Americans uninsured\n In 2006 47 million Americans uninsured\n \n U.S. Health care spending per capita increased from \n ___$356 in 1970 \n _$6,697 in 2005 \n $12,320 in 2015 (projected)",
