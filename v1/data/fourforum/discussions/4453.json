   "This is a copy of an Instant Message Jaaaman sent to me the other day. I was not online at the time he began this message nor was I online at the time he abruptly ends his message to me. You'll notice that he does not finish his message to me nor does he attempt to send an email to complete his tyrate. \n \n \n \njaaaman@sbcglobal.net (3/5/2005 7:04:00 AM): Gay rights activists are asking one to accept the premise that marriage belongs to a particular person in the first place. Guess what, it doesn't. The institution of marriage is much larger than any one person and is not subject to the whim of any one society.\n\n \n So say you.\n \n \n \n Legally, Marriage is: \"The civil status, condition or relation of one man and one woman united in law for life, for the discharge to each other and the community of the duties legally incumbent upon those whose association is founded on the distinction of sex.\" Black's Law Dictionary, (Fourth Edition)\n\n \n And obviously you agree with this myopic definition. I in turn, do not. This is where we will always differ. \n \n \n \njaaaman@sbcglobal.net (3/5/2005 7:05:17 AM): No matter what the MA Supreme Judicial Court wants to pretend, homosexual relationships, no matter how \"loving\", are not marriages.\n\n \n ...in your eyes. Please remember to preface your opinions as such. \n \n \nThey can never be marriages. Marriage is unique in that it is founded upon the distinction between the opposite sexes.\n\n \n ...in your opinion. \n What you are hinging your personal opinion on is the cultural ideals of gender roles. A fairly common but still myopic ideal which does not take into account the multitude of variations throughout history of what exactly are gender roles and what part they may or may not play in child rearing. This also brings up another issue of which has little to do with marriage at all, the idea of an ideal child rearing situation. I will not get into this now as I feel it has or should have little bearing on the discussion of marriage. \n \n \n \n If I have an Orange in my Hand, and I insist to you that it is an apple, That doesn't make it an apple. No matter how much I personally believe or want what I have in my hand to be an apple, it does not make it an apple.\n\n \n Again you point out just how myopic your view of marriage actually is by your analogy that a marriage is somehow static.\n \n \n \nNo Court, No Law, No Edict and No amount of insistance can change the fact, that what I hold in my hand is still an orange. Marriage is a unique relationship between a man and a woman BASED ON THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN SEX. That last point, of which I keep harping is key.\n\n \n Please remember once again, this is YOUR OPINION! It is not fact, there is no science to marriage. I actually feel sorry for you that you cannot look beyond your narrow ideals. It's just that sort of mind set that leads to divorce. \n \n \n \njaaaman@sbcglobal.net (3/5/2005 7:05:57 AM): Without the fundamental difference in sex, you can't have a marriage. What makes a marriage a marriage is the unique relationship based on the Distinction of the sexes.\n\n \n \n You can say that a thousand times, but not once have you defined what those supposed \"UNIQUE\" distinctions actually are. Are they sexual compatibility? Are they gender roles set by society? Or is it that you hear it therefore you must believe it? \n \n \n This is the precise conclusion that the Kentucky Court of appeals reached in Jones V Hallahan when they said: In substance, the relationship proposed by the appellants does not authorize the issuance of a marriage license because what they propose is not a marriage. This is the precise reason that the Minnesota Supreme Court in Baker V Nelson stated:\n\n \n Sadly this is where Jaaaman's IM cuts off. I guess at this point is where he realized that I wasn't even online at the time and he was simply sending his argument into thin air.",
