   "SALT LAKE CITY - An advocacy group is asking the Mormon church to support several bills that will be submitted to the Utah Legislature supporting rights for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.\n \n Equality Utah said Monday it will help draft five bills for the 2009 session, which starts in January. Three of the bills seek equal treatment for domestic partners on hospitalization, medical care, housing, employment and probate rights.\n \n A fourth bill would create a domestic partner registry and a fifth would repeal the second part of Utah's marriage-defining constitutional amendment, which Equality Utah Public Policy Manager Will Carlson said has been \"misinterpreted to avoid any recognition of gay couples.\" \n \n The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints supported Proposition 8 in California to ban gay marriage there. But Equality Utah said that during the campaign to pass the constitutional amendment, the church said it didn't object to some rights for same-sex couples.\n \n \"Just last week, Elder L. Whitney Clayton stated the LDS Church does not oppose civil union or domestic partnerships,' \" said Equality Utah Chairwoman Stephanie Pappas. \"We are taking the LDS Church at its word.\"\n \n In a statement released following the approval of Proposition 8 in California, officials of the church said they do \"not object to rights for same-sex couples regarding hospitalization and medical care, fair housing and employment rights, or probate rights.\"\n \n A church spokeswoman told The Associated Press on Tuesday that it would have no comment.\n \n Previous attempts at passing similar bills have failed in the Legislature.\n \n Sen. Scott McCoy, D-Salt Lake City, said the church's statement changes everything.\n \n \"They hadn't said any of that yet. They've said that now,\" said McCoy, the only openly gay member of the Senate. \"This is an invitation to make a reality of what's been said by the church. ... (The church) has said some things that are very encouraging to us, and we're here to say, Hey, let's see if we can't move forward and get to a place where we are in a more fair and just Utah, outside of the marriage discussion.' \"\n \n Sen. John Valentine, R-Orem, said that if the Mormon Church clarified its statements regarding same-sex rights, lawmakers might be less reluctant to agree to make changes.\n \n \"Equality Utah is probably correct in interpreting those statements from the church,\" he said. \"It would probably make it an easier argument than it would be without that.\"Group drafting gay-rights bills\n \n When the opponents of gay marriage originally passed the California law against gay marriage, they claimed that they were only interested in \"marriage\" and that it would not be used against civil unions.\n Then, after the anti-gay marriage law had passed, they quickly turned around and tried to use it in court to claim \"the people\" also wanted civil unions revoked.\n \n When the Mormons utilized their attack against gay marriage in California, they put out a few lies that I have yet to see anybody on this message board even try to defend.\n \n With the possibility of gay union protections in their own back-yard, anybody expect the anti-gay people to stick to their word? emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Since when is \"does not object\" synonymous as saying \"we'll support\"? It seems to me that you can't expect the LDS Church to become activists when all they said was that they wouldn't object to some of these things. If all they do is DO NOTHING and/or SAY NOTHING--that is, not stand in the way of it and therefore don't object to it--they are sticking to their word. If the church doesn't actually OPPOSE the measure, then these gay rights groups can't really say they are going against their word. All the the LDS Church said was \"it didn't object\", according to the gay rights groups' own statement. If I say \"I don't object\" to something, that doesn't mean I have to go on record somewhere saying \"I'm a supporter of so-and-so.\" It simply means \"I don't OBJECT\" to it.",

   "And without surprise, the Mormon Church proves my expectations correct.\n \n To re-quote the original article...\n \n \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints supported Proposition 8 in California to ban gay marriage there. But Equality Utah said that during the campaign to pass the constitutional amendment, the church said it didn't object to some rights for same-sex couples.\n \n \"Just last week, Elder L. Whitney Clayton stated the LDS Church does not oppose civil union or domestic partnerships,' \" said Equality Utah Chairwoman Stephanie Pappas. \"We are taking the LDS Church at its word.\"\n\n \n And now to the new development where they prove their claim false...\n \n The Illinois House will begin considering another Civil Unions bill this week. Introduced by Rep. Greg Harris on February 20, HB 2234 has been assigned to the Youth and Family Committee, which will hold a hearing on Thursday. We&#8217;ve received word that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has engaged its private communications network to bombard state legislators with phone calls in opposition to the bill.\n \n The Mormon Church maintains a private internet social-networking and website service in lieu of individual churches having their own individual Internet web sites. This allows the church to oversee the information that is made available to members and nonmembers. It also allows the church to maintain private information that is only made available to church members.\n \n Among the many capabilities the web site has for members who are authorized to log in is the ability to send private email to other church members in the same ward. It also allows a ward bishop to send a blanket email to all members of his ward, and it allows a stake president to send a blanket email to all members of his stake.\n \n But this is key: no individual member can send a blanket email to all members of his ward without it first going through his or her bishop. The same is true at the stake level, where the stake president would have to first authorize the message. So when a church member receives a broadcast message, he or she can be assured that it has the blessing, so to speak, of the bishop or stake president.\n \n In a private email sent out to LDS members of at least one ward in Illinois, church members are being encouraged to call their representative to voice their opposition to the bill, which would provide same-sex couples with recognition and limited protections under Illinois law. But the official LDS-sanctioned email to members is loaded with much of the same misinformation that was present in the campaign against California&#8217;s Proposition 8.\n Box Turtle Bulletin Mormon Machine Cranking Up Against Illinois Civil Unions Bill\n \n Considering how the Mormon church tried to hide their exten$ive financial involvement in Prop 8 and the grotesquely dishonest campaign they ran with absurd claims, is it any wonder that their above claim is also shown false?",

   "SALT LAKE CITY - An advocacy group is asking the Mormon church to support several bills that will be submitted to the Utah Legislature supporting rights for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.\n \n Equality Utah said Monday it will help draft five bills for the 2009 session, which starts in January. Three of the bills seek equal treatment for domestic partners on hospitalization, medical care, housing, employment and probate rights.\n \n A fourth bill would create a domestic partner registry and a fifth would repeal the second part of Utah's marriage-defining constitutional amendment, which Equality Utah Public Policy Manager Will Carlson said has been \"misinterpreted to avoid any recognition of gay couples.\" \n \n The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints supported Proposition 8 in California to ban gay marriage there. But Equality Utah said that during the campaign to pass the constitutional amendment, the church said it didn't object to some rights for same-sex couples.\n \n \"Just last week, Elder L. Whitney Clayton stated the LDS Church does not oppose civil union or domestic partnerships,' \" said Equality Utah Chairwoman Stephanie Pappas. \"We are taking the LDS Church at its word.\"\n \n In a statement released following the approval of Proposition 8 in California, officials of the church said they do \"not object to rights for same-sex couples regarding hospitalization and medical care, fair housing and employment rights, or probate rights.\"\n \n A church spokeswoman told The Associated Press on Tuesday that it would have no comment.\n \n Previous attempts at passing similar bills have failed in the Legislature.\n \n Sen. Scott McCoy, D-Salt Lake City, said the church's statement changes everything.\n \n \"They hadn't said any of that yet. They've said that now,\" said McCoy, the only openly gay member of the Senate. \"This is an invitation to make a reality of what's been said by the church. ... (The church) has said some things that are very encouraging to us, and we're here to say, Hey, let's see if we can't move forward and get to a place where we are in a more fair and just Utah, outside of the marriage discussion.' \"\n \n Sen. John Valentine, R-Orem, said that if the Mormon Church clarified its statements regarding same-sex rights, lawmakers might be less reluctant to agree to make changes.\n \n \"Equality Utah is probably correct in interpreting those statements from the church,\" he said. \"It would probably make it an easier argument than it would be without that.\"\n \n When the opponents of gay marriage originally passed the California law against gay marriage, they claimed that they were only interested in \"marriage\" and that it would not be used against civil unions.\n Then, after the anti-gay marriage law had passed, they quickly turned around and tried to use it in court to claim \"the people\" also wanted civil unions revoked.\n \n When the Mormons utilized their attack against gay marriage in California, they put out a few lies that I have yet to see anybody on this message board even try to defend.\n \n With the possibility of gay union protections in their own back-yard, anybody expect the anti-gay people to stick to their word? emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n I think it is encouraging that the Church of Latter Day Saints is finding common ground with gay right activists. I don't necessarily think that the Mormons are 'putting out a few lies,' but just trying to cooperate as well as their own regulations will allow. Even though I am for gay marriage, I definitely think religion should hold its own regulations. \n \n However, at the same time, if LDS wants to dismantle civil unions as well, I think it is taking it a step too far. Civil unions do not have any religious connotations; as far as I know, a civil union is a purely governmental institution (but please, correct me if I'm wrong). \n \n I am not allowed to post any links in my posts yet, but I did find another article pertaining to this debate. It is called \"Mormons Called On To Support Gay Rights\" by Carlos Santoscoy. I'm sure if you google it, it'll come up. I am also hoping to find articles from the Mormon's viewpoint, because I'm wondering what specific changes would be made to hospitalization, medical care, housing, employment and probate rights. \n \n My main question is: what is the LDS' point-of-view on these subjects, in relation to their religious doctrine?",

There are a variety of examples of gays who have a member of the couple fall ill, and the \"family\" who has disapproved of the relationship swoop in and legally assume control of the infirmed. What follows can include a denial of visitation rights and/or an assumption of assets that were originally shared in the couple.\n There is one case I remember where non-family people acknowledged that it would do the sick gay man good to see his partner who he loved, but the family refused out of spite.\n For employment, the interest is probably in making sure people can't be fired just based on being gay or straight, much like people can't be fired for being Jewish or Black or Christian.\n I suspect that is the interest of the legislation.\n \n As for the Mormon's viewpoint, I don't have anything specific on that, but I did find a Utah poll (which didn't specify religious affiliation) on the issue.\n [quote]Earlier this month, a poll commissioned by Equality Utah found that 63 percent support gay legal protections including some rights for same-sex couples.\n The survey found that 62 percent believe it should be illegal to fire someone for being gay and 57 percent said it should be illegal to deny housing to someone for being gay.\n On the issue of partner rights, 73 percent said they would support health insurance coverage for a partner or other designated adult for state employees. Utahans however are not ready for same-sex marriage. Only 20 percent said they supported gay marriage.\n Utah gay rights bills get off to bad start | News Story on 365gay.com",

   "Oh, well, what was I thinking. It must be a huge Morman conspiracy. If one Priest was to send an e-mail does it mean the Catholics are in on it to?\n\n From the article...\n \nThe Mormon Church maintains a private internet social-networking and website service in lieu of individual churches having their own individual Internet web sites. This allows the church to oversee the information that is made available to members and nonmembers. It also allows the church to maintain private information that is only made available to church members.\n \n Among the many capabilities the web site has for members who are authorized to log in is the ability to send private email to other church members in the same ward. It also allows a ward bishop to send a blanket email to all members of his ward, and it allows a stake president to send a blanket email to all members of his stake.\n \n But this is key: no individual member can send a blanket email to all members of his ward without it first going through his or her bishop. The same is true at the stake level, where the stake president would have to first authorize the message. So when a church member receives a broadcast message, he or she can be assured that it has the blessing, so to speak, of the bishop or stake president.\n\n Pretty rigid constraints that do not lend themselves to \"arbitrary\" e-mail distribution.\n \n \n \nHow could it go unnoticed with activist like yourself bringing it up every five minutes. It's not like they tried to hide anything they were simply waiting for the court to tell them what they needed to do.\n\n There was a concentrated legal effort to avoid revealing this information, and yet in your mind \"it's not like they tried to hide anything\".\n The LAW already told them what they needed to do.\n They tried to get a court to say something different.\n They WERE trying to hide what they were ALREADY LEGALLY BOUND to reveal.\n \n \n \nShame on them for trying to avoid threats of violence.\n\n I see you bought in hook, line, and sinker to their excuse...\n And just a few moments ago you were proclaiming that this publicity was \"helping them get their message across\".\n I guess your ideals on whether or not the publicity helps or hurts the Mormons depends upon what spin you think you can put on it...\n \n \n \nDo you copy the NYT on all of your e-mails?

Maybe the threats and/or the pending court case. You'll notice they gave full disclosure right after the case was settled.\n\n The court case THEY BROUGHT based on thoroughly spurious reasoning.\n \n So I guess if a husband brings a court case trying to say that he shouldn't have to pay alimony, then the fact that the HUSBAND MADE HIS PAYMENT LATE by doing that should be ignored...\n \n \n \nYou really are determined to build this into some sort of conspiracy.
