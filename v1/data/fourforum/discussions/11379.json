   "I read this article on Bloomberg earlier and thought it was a telling tale of a number of things:\n \n http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=a1liVM3tG3aI&refer=home\n  July 14 (Bloomberg) -- At an investor presentation in May, Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit said shrinking the bank's $2.2 trillion balance sheet, the biggest in the U.S., was a cornerstone of his turnaround plan.\n \n Nowhere mentioned in the accompanying 66-page handout were the additional $1.1 trillion of assets that New York-based Citigroup keeps off its books: trusts to sell mortgage-backed securities, financing vehicles to issue short-term debt and collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, to repackage bonds. \n\n Now, a few things to this and then I don't need to comment anymore but please feel free to respond:\n \n 1) It is obvious the worst is coming for Citi and the banking industry. It seems the tip of iceberg is starting to show which on the plus side might mean are recession's rock bottom might be in the mid to near future. Of course we have to wait for a few more banks to crash but that's why we have FDIC....oh wait, they are strapped for cash too...yikes.\n \n 2) It should be more than obvious to any accountant or business manager that Enron did nothing to teach auditors. SOX accomplished some things but failed to identify the major issue which is that \"borderline but within an interpretation of the rules\" is just another way of saying fraud. Citi is keeping a trillion dollars off their books even after the SIVs had to be put on when they went belly up. There is no doubt this 1.1 trillion was borderline accounting but instead of auditors saying \"no, that may be technically accurate but you are attempting to hide the truth\" they work for the company and screw the investor. I've been saying for almost a year now that Citi looks more and more like Enron everyday. This is coming from me, an auditor, who just briefly looked into Citi's financial's and read the news. If you remember Enron you will know that the smoke was clearly shown long before the auditors ever caught up. \n \n Good grief, the memory of people seems to be less than a year!\n \n Any thoughts? Daewoo, you still around?",

   "Yep, still around occasionally.\n \n IMO the writing was on the wall for citi several months ago when they started selling off businesses that were performing WELL...NOT marginal performers...and talking about \"trimming fat\". You do not \"trim fat\" by selling off things that were showing a 30-45% profit margins and selling them for what basically worked out to be 2x earnings. That is NOT trimming fat, that is \"panic fund raising\"...then they still show a major loss this quarter.\n \n On the up side, in a completely blatant attempt at \"regulating\" a floor under the market, the SEC tried to force a virtual ban on shorting financials. \n \n WE are so screwed.",

   "If todays news from Merrill is any indicator, Citi is as good as dead. Merrill ended up selling about $30 billion in CDOs and only got 20 cents on the dollar for them. Citi is sitting on nearly 5x as much as as I understand it has only written theirs down 8-12%...and that is just what they have kept on their books.\n \n This does have a lot of people scratching their heads and wondering why in the hell Merril was only showing 10% write downs on these in earnings reports and then ended up selling them at an 80% markdown and got stuck financing the deal.",
