   "http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml\n \n Researchers help define what makes a political conservative \n \n \nBERKELEY - Politically conservative agendas may range from supporting the Vietnam War to upholding traditional moral and religious values to opposing welfare. But are there consistent underlying motivations? \n \n Four researchers who culled through 50 years of research literature about the psychology of conservatism report that at the core of political conservatism is the resistance to change and a tolerance for inequality, and that some of the common psychological factors linked to political conservatism include:\n \n Fear and aggression\n \n Dogmatism and intolerance of ambiguity\n \n Uncertainty avoidance\n \n Need for cognitive closure\n \n Terror management\n \"From our perspective, these psychological factors are capable of contributing to the adoption of conservative ideological contents, either independently or in combination,\" the researchers wrote in an article, \"Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition,\" recently published in the American Psychological Association's Psychological Bulletin.\n \n Assistant Professor Jack Glaser of the University of California, Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy and Visiting Professor Frank Sulloway of UC Berkeley joined lead author, Associate Professor John Jost of Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, and Professor Arie Kruglanski of the University of Maryland at College Park, to analyze the literature on conservatism. \n \n The psychologists sought patterns among 88 samples, involving 22,818 participants, taken from journal articles, books and conference papers. The material originating from 12 countries included speeches and interviews given by politicians, opinions and verdicts rendered by judges, as well as experimental, field and survey studies.\n \n Ten meta-analytic calculations performed on the material - which included various types of literature and approaches from different countries and groups - yielded consistent, common threads, Glaser said.\n \n The avoidance of uncertainty, for example, as well as the striving for certainty, are particularly tied to one key dimension of conservative thought - the resistance to change or hanging onto the status quo, they said. \n \n The terror management feature of conservatism can be seen in post-Sept. 11 America, where many people appear to shun and even punish outsiders and those who threaten the status of cherished world views, they wrote.\n \n Concerns with fear and threat, likewise, can be linked to a second key dimension of conservatism - an endorsement of inequality, a view reflected in the Indian caste system, South African apartheid and the conservative, segregationist politics of the late Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-South S.C.). \n \n Disparate conservatives share a resistance to change and acceptance of inequality, the authors said. Hitler, Mussolini, and former President Ronald Reagan were individuals, but all were right-wing conservatives because they preached a return to an idealized past and condoned inequality in some form. Talk host Rush Limbaugh can be described the same way, the authors commented in a published reply to the article. \n \n This research marks the first synthesis of a vast amount of information about conservatism, and the result is an \"elegant and unifying explanation\" for political conservatism under the rubric of motivated social cognition, said Sulloway. That entails the tendency of people's attitudinal preferences on policy matters to be explained by individual needs based on personality, social interests or existential needs.\n \n The researchers' analytical methods allowed them to determine the effects for each class of factors and revealed \"more pluralistic and nuanced understanding of the source of conservatism,\" Sulloway said.\n \n While most people resist change, Glaser said, liberals appear to have a higher tolerance for change than conservatives do.\n \n As for conservatives' penchant for accepting inequality, he said, one contemporary example is liberals' general endorsement of extending rights and liberties to disadvantaged minorities such as gays and lesbians, compared to conservatives' opposing position.\n \n The researchers said that conservative ideologies, like virtually all belief systems, develop in part because they satisfy some psychological needs, but that \"does not mean that conservatism is pathological or that conservative beliefs are necessarily false, irrational, or unprincipled.\"\n \n They also stressed that their findings are not judgmental. \n \n \"In many cases, including mass politics, 'liberal' traits may be liabilities, and being intolerant of ambiguity, high on the need for closure, or low in cognitive complexity might be associated with such generally valued characteristics as personal commitment and unwavering loyalty,\" the researchers wrote.\n \n This intolerance of ambiguity can lead people to cling to the familiar, to arrive at premature conclusions, and to impose simplistic cliches and stereotypes, the researchers advised.\n \n The latest debate about the possibility that the Bush administration ignored intelligence information that discounted reports of Iraq buying nuclear material from Africa may be linked to the conservative intolerance for ambiguity and or need for closure, said Glaser.\n \n \"For a variety of psychological reasons, then, right-wing populism may have more consistent appeal than left-wing populism, especially in times of potential crisis and instability,\" he said.\n \n Glaser acknowledged that the team's exclusive assessment of the psychological motivations of political conservatism might be viewed as a partisan exercise. However, he said, there is a host of information available about conservatism, but not about liberalism. \n \n The researchers conceded cases of left-wing ideologues, such as Stalin, Khrushchev or Castro, who, once in power, steadfastly resisted change, allegedly in the name of egalitarianism. \n \n Yet, they noted that some of these figures might be considered politically conservative in the context of the systems that they defended. The researchers noted that Stalin, for example, was concerned about defending and preserving the existing Soviet system.\n \n Although they concluded that conservatives are less \"integratively complex\" than others are, Glaser said, \"it doesn't mean that they're simple-minded.\" \n \n Conservatives don't feel the need to jump through complex, intellectual hoops in order to understand or justify some of their positions, he said. \"They are more comfortable seeing and stating things in black and white in ways that would make liberals squirm,\" Glaser said.\n \n He pointed as an example to a 2001 trip to Italy, where President George W. Bush was asked to explain himself. The Republican president told assembled world leaders, \"I know what I believe and I believe what I believe is right.\" And in 2002, Bush told a British reporter, \"Look, my job isn't to nuance.\"\n\n \n Researchers found out what I and others knew for a long time....",

   "Want to know what I think of Conservatism?\n \n Economics\n \n Conservatives believe that the Government should not help the poor. A Government that helps its people is the kind of Government we need. Conservatives say its takeing away freedoms, but it is really giveing more freedoms to those who are very poor. The poor live horrible lives with all the crime and poverty, you cannot raise a family off of minimum wage, and its not always easy to get a job. Its very easy to get yourself killed. Because the poor areas get such bad education, its extremely hard for them to get out of that position, contrary to what Conservatives say. They should not be forced to live like this, the Government should help these poor people. The filthy rich don't use nearly all their money, they can afford a Leftist Government and stay rich. How ever, Conservatives reject any idea that would help out these suffering people. Conservatives believe the poor are just a bunch of lazy bumbs. This is not true, its hard to work your way out of the rat hole. Conservatives don't want the wealthy to pay a dime to help these people. As the poor suffer in life, Conservatives yell out \"Communist!\" to anyone who speaks out against what we are letting these people go through :( .\n \n Environment\n \n The Environment is in danger. As industry rapes our Earth of its beauty. Conservatives call anybody who speaks against the destruction of the environment \"dumbass environmental hippies\". Conservatives don't care that millions of acres of beautiful forests are being chopped down every breath you take. How heartless can people get? They think that extra money for wealthy business is more important than the forests which are home for many animals! Humans should not be given the right to tear down our Environment and murder millions of animals and even cause extinction. We should protect what remains of our planet for our future generations. Conservatives however say otherwise. How heartless can people be, to believe that we should rip our planet and kill animals that get in our way so wealthy industries can get even richer? Its unfortunate that nearly half(if not more) of Americans don't give a rats XXX about our Environment, which me and many other Liberals charish.\n Forests aren't the only issue however. Conservatives(George W. Bush being more specific) don't want to research renewable and cleaner energy. Oil is limited and mineing it and useing it is slowing destroying our planet. We should use sources of energy that are more abuntant(sp?). Conservatives however don't care about better sources of energy and they continue to purchase tanking SUVs that guzzle up gas like a monster.\n \n Social Views\n \n Conservatives can be very heartless when it comes to these views. Many Conservatives believe that homosexuals, minorities, and sometimes even women, are inferior beings of life. That is clearly speaking out Nazism. People should be treated equally. White Male Christians should not get special and better treatment than everybody else. Homosexuals should not be prevented from getting married because they are people to and should be treated fairly. Many Conservatives however think Homosexuals are evil. Homophobia is just like Racism. I don't know if I gave this Paragraph that correct title but oh well....\n \n Intolerance\n \n Cosnervatives are often intolerant of other ethnics and beliefs. Conservatives spew out tons of hate towards people who have different views than they do. Conservatives call Liberals \"Worthless Communists!\" http://www.avoiceofone.com/mt/archives/000026.html . Conservatives say Liberals are the most undereducated people in the world, even though Liberals are clearly the more educated. Conservatives are arrogant and act like they are soooo smart, even thought they are usually just a bunch of mindless sheep. Conservatives say Liberals are immature and need to grow up. However its Conservatives who act like children. We Liberals are the more mature. Many Conservatives are just so stuck-up and hateful its sickens me. \n \n more may come later....",

   "I'm not surprised that this was written, hosted, and posted by someone in the wonderful state of California where there elected democrat is running the state into the ground. Perhaps you could post an article concerning this to give some balanced perspectives. You do want to be fair don't you?\n \n I'm not going to respond to the entire two posts, but I will respond to the points you made on economics. First off, what your asking for is socialism if you want to take money from the rich and give it to the poor on a widescale. Can we only imagine why this doesn't work? The rich are not rich for no reason. They are economists, innovators, and well educated in general. The poor are just the opposite in most cases. Now in a Free Market system, which type of person would do the best given a great deal of money? I'm sure you will answer that the rich person will but you still think it is unfair. Well since you will agree with me here guess what, your agreeing to weaken our economy so that you can feel better about it.\n \n Now lets look at the working perspective of the whole issue. Why should these poor people work if given all the money they need and why should the rich people work if they are just going to get their money taken from them and given to the poor? You will see that this is a system that needs to be avoided yet that is close to what democrats are pushing for. Conservatives are fine with giving the poor some help and making it possible for the hardest working to succeed, but they are not giving free rides either. How far do you actually want this socialist wealth sharing to go?\n \n Do you know why conservatives yell out communist at ideas such as wealth sharing? Because it is a socialist idea. Do you know that communism is a form of socialism? Well now you see where they are coming from right? This idea is a key idea in any communist government. They want to level the playing field for everyone and have the terms rich and poor become non-existant. This is what you are heading towards I suppose. It simply doesn't make sense but if it makes you feel better about yourself, I'm sure you would gladly impose your views on us to do so.",

The economy is stronger when a Liberal is president. Its Conservatives that weaken our economy by giving the wealthy tax cuts. Many Conservatives even want to get rid of taxes. That would ruin our economy.\n \n \nWhy should these poor people work if given all the money they need and why should the rich people work if they are just going to get their money taken from them and given to the poor? You will see that this is a system that needs to be avoided yet that is close to what democrats are pushing for.\n\n \n You obviously don't know XXXX about Europe, knowing Socialism works great over there. And no, they will have to work for money, but the Government should make social programs to get the poor better education, and make living conditions better in the poor areas. Also, minimum wage should be raised, however Conservatives oppose such an idea.\n \n \nConservatives are fine with giving the poor some help and making it possible for the hardest working to succeed, but they are not giving free rides either. How far do you actually want this socialist wealth sharing to go?\n\n \n Conservatives wouldn't pay a dime to help the poor. They refuse to raise minimum wage. They refuse to improve education in the poor areas. They refuse to pay for their medicare. Conservatives believe in a government where people don't help eachother at all. While Liberals believe people should work together. If Socialism is so bad, why does it work in Europe? Conservatives don't know anything about Europe what so ever.\n \n \nDo you know why conservatives yell out communist at ideas such as wealth sharing? Because it is a socialist idea. Do you know that communism is a form of socialism? Well now you see where they are coming from right? This idea is a key idea in any communist government.

Everybody earns the same amount of money, and the Government tells people what jobs they have. I don't believe in such a Government. People should be able to choose their jobs. Liberal beliefs are from Communists'. Not only that but Communists resist change, similar to what Conservatives do.\n \n Do you have anything to say about my Environmental views? Why not tell me why we should destroy our forests? We don't need to destroy the environment in order to have a good economy. Conservatives say we do, but that is a bunch of XXXXXXXX. Clinton had a very good economy, while protecting the forests. Bush currently has a horrible economy and he is allowing the forests to be logged.",

   "Bush destroyed Texas... good one.\n \n Reagan had the longest period of sustained economic growth since WW II. Inflation and unemployment hit lows not seen in decades, he doubled federal revenues through his term. Anyone who says Reagan had a bad economy obviously doesn't know what they're talking about. \n \n Actually, Clinton did give some tax cuts. Check your facts. Also, you could say that Clinton stole that election too. The Democrats did some spinning that the media took and ran with. They said the Bush I economy was getting worse, when in fact it was getting much better. The economy Clinton had was already going well, and he caught the tech boom. Clinton's last two quarters in office were bad, too. The recession Bush had was not his making, it came from Clinton. 9/11 didn't help, nor did all the corporate scandals that happened under Clinton that came out under Bush. But as Dsa says, the economy moves in cycles. It depends what you catch...\n \n First off, I know no one who works off of minimum wage... and if they did they would qualify for the EITC, which would get them a few thousand dollars, I believe. But a single parent working on minimum wage who had a child made some bad choices. It's not up to us to fix their mistakes.\n \n I see why Libertarians want to get rid of income taxes... look at our government. So much waste... so much waste. Not that I support it, but it's easy to see why.\n \n And I don't want you calling Conservatives intolerant because some Conservatives on a board were. I could do the same with Liberals.

   "SOME tax cuts improve the economy SOMETIMES. Not always, but not never either. The Clinton cuts are an example of \"good\" tax cuts, focused on the middle class, likely to re-enter the economy. The Bush tax cuts are an example of \"bad\" cuts, slanted to the rich and unlikely to re-enter the economy.

It's not up to us to fix their mistakes.\n \n \n I don't think you can make that into a universal statement (as you do). First of all, people can have children w.out it being a \"mistake,\" and still fall into trouble. Widows, mothers with deadbeat dads, and rape victims all fall into this catagory. Secondly, even if it is the mother's \"bad decision,\" you are punishing the child for the mother's mistake, which is unethical, not to mention immoral (and one of the key reasons why poor mothers are one of the most likely groups to seek abortions). Third, with the economy in the situation that it is, it is hard to fault poor mothers from taking any job they can find, and employers, being in a beneficial job market (from their perspective), can in essence drop wages to the bare minimum. If the mother doesn't take the job, you'd be attacking her for not working. If she DOES take the job, you assail her for not having a good enough job. Its lose lose for her, especially considering lack of childcare oppurtunities mean her child will grow up entirely parentless. Fourth, the EITC. Now, you know I am the biggest EITC cheerleader there is. But unfortunately, the Bush administration, having finally finding a tax credit they can oppose, have a) refused to advertise the EITC, so many families don't know it exists b) have refused to stop exploitive tactics by tax preparers who take giant chunks of the EITC income a family would refuse (by giving out \"refund anticipation loans\" with rates as high as 700%) and c) has instituted \"anti-fraud\" measures that make applying for the EITC so onerous that many families have just given up on it (incidentally, the amount of revenue lost via EITC fraud is a fraction of that lost via similar tax shelter schemes done by the rich). So even that isn't a viable option.\n \n \n Is it really my responsibility to pay someone who has not helped me at all? If they don't want to work, then why should I have to pay for them to survive? \n\n \n first of all, the premise there is flawed, as in a capitalist society full employment for all who desire it is NOT guarenteed (and in fact the unemployment rate is calculated using solely the people who are seeking jobs but can't find them). So then the question becomes, \"do you have a responsibilty to help someone who has not helped you at all (but presumably is trying to work)\"? In my opinion, yes, and I am writing up a paper I call \"The Chain of Obligation\" to justify this. Basically, if you a) have the means, and b) are the closest entity in terms of relationship to the victim that is capable of helping, then you have the obligation to help. With regards to these people, with the state budget crisis, the federal government meets both requirements, thus it has the obligation.",

   "The top 50% of taxpayers pay over 90% of the taxes, so yes, Bush's tax cut did go to the rich, because they're the only ones who pay taxes.\n \n \n Do I need to answer this argument AGAIN? The rich pay that percentage of the taxes b/c they make close to that percentage of the income. The situation is merely a progressive system that responds to the income inequality inherant in capitalism. Not to say income inequality is inherantly bad, merely that its impact on the lower end of the scale needs to be mitigated.\n \n \nTax cuts to the rich can still stimulate the economy.\n \n \n But as a general rule, they don't. And in the case of the most recent cut, the CBO estimates the longterm impact to be negative, and the shortterm impact to be minimal.\n \n \nBut is it our responsibility to tell people what to pay? If Person A is willing to work for 3 dollars/hour and Person B is able to hire someone at 3 dollars/hour, why should the government say that Person A cannot work for Person B?\n \n \n This represents a key philosophical conundrum, namely, idealist liberty vs. \"real\" liberty (also known as possession of liberty vs. ability to exercise). An anarchistic society would be one of total \"idealistic\" liberty, in that you COULD do anything. practically though, you'd have virtually no liberty at all, unless you were the baddest boy on the block. Otherwise, he could use his liberty to force you to be his servant. Moving back to your example, capitalism, as a pure form, is economic anarchy. Market decides. Thus, the same parallel that gives justification for the existance of government (protecting rights, insuring the ability to EXERCISE liberty), can be used to justify economic intervention. The inherant exploitive actions of the rich towards the poor in capitalism (similar to how the bully can exploit his neighbors in an anarchy) mandates govt. intervening. Though in your case the worker has ideal liberty to decide at what wage he works, practically he is forced to take the offer (and if he doesn't, conservatives will label him an unworking bum), but beyond that, the company has no incentive to maintain wages at $3/hour, but rather can drop them to 2 or 1 dollar, or lower. This is the infamous \"race to the bottom\" and unfortunately the poor have no bargaining leverage against this. Their \"real\" liberty is gone. The minimum wage is the govt. stepping in to level the playing field.\n \n As for EITC marketing, the majority of it is done by the states and municipalities (both whom adore a program that helps the poor but doesn't come out of THEIR pockets :) ).

   "Anybody have anything to say about protecting our Environmnet?\n\n \n I guess I can give an opinion on it although not a particularly educated one. From what I remember, Europe, Japan, and China are in worse environmental states than the US. I know that the US has some of the few cities in the world where pollution levels are dropping. LA I believe was dropping in the last few years.\n \n The environment is a world problem especially when it comes to the US. The US doesn't really drill for its own oil because we can get it from somewhere else. The US doesn't really cut down its own forests because we can get them from somewhere else. The US protects its lands while paying other poorer countries to destroy theirs and give the raw materials to them. I believe this is true for the most part and that has helped preserve parts of our environment in the past.\n \n As for our polluting, it is still an ongoing problem but I remember hearing that Europe has a far worse pollution problem than the US perhaps because of their population and lower land mass. They are in the state that the US will be soon if we don't do something and of course they are progressing along as well in their polluting. Something clearly has to be done eventually.\n \n As far as politics go, I believe that democrats are a good thing for the environment. They are going to make it a priority to protect it while conservatives won't. I would hate to see conservatives take much more than 50% control of the government if only because they would speed up the destruction of our environment if not kept in check by the democrats.\n \n I'm not sure how the entire pollution problem will be solved. My guess is eventually an alternative to oil will be discovered and ways will be found to grow trees in shorter periods of time to meet our needs. Maybe these solutions are not going to even be discovered in the US and will instead by done in Europe who need them more than the US does.",
