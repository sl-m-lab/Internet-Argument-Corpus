Orders are six-months ahead of supply. \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/bw/20050624/bs_bw/b3941072mz054\n \n Worker assembly salaries in Romania, where the cars are produced, are $324/mo, versus $4700 in Europe and $5400 US. \n \n Chinese auto assemblers are paid $180/mo. Does anyone else see where this is heading? I can see dealerships right next to the McDonald's in all WalMart stores.",

   "The Chinese cars will be coming. That's why the Koreans are now moving up the price ladder. American mfgrs still have an opening, and that is in the high-mpg realm (especially in the alt. fuel realm). Screwed the pooch on hybrids, but hybrids (as they are now) are only good for the city. They get basically what I get now in my regular car. But get those engines passed 60mph on the highway, and many will go there. Get an SUV past 40mpg on the highway and all the un-talented scaredy-drivers would flock there.",

   "There have been recent articles about the sweatshops in Bangladesh, including the ones that Wal Mart buys from. They are probably the cheapest sweatshops in the world. There is also a recent article about India and the future of automaking. \"Outsourcing\" is profitable for US automakers. I have to think of all those GM factory workers that are now unemployed, many confronting pension issues. \n \n Cars from China is a different issue. The dollar is strong against the Indian and Bangladesh rupee, but is weak against the Chinese yen. China has maintained this as policy, which has been unfair to the US for a long time now. China is at a point to come out now as world power, buy Unocal and compete against the US.",
