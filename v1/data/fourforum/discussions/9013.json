   "Yesterday, we took my son's car to a race at MidMichigan Motorplex. After a scary first pass in which the traction was questionable and I watched the car cross the finish line almost sideways (I could see the driver's side door from the starting line....not a good feeling.), he ran a best of 8.78@161mph. Later in the day, he attempted to better that mark but the engine grenaded at ~1000' mark and all we saw was smoke for a couple of anxious minutes. \n Thankfully, as I was about to panic on the starting line, my cell phone rang and it was my son. He told me that he had managed to stay off the wall despite oil being thrown all over his tires at close to 150mph. (He crossed the finish line in 9 seconds spewing oil all over the place.)\n http://files.filefront.com/blown+up+wmvwmv/;5988359;;/fileinfo.html\n http://files.filefront.com/8secpass+wmvwmv/;5988311;;/fileinfo.html\n \n Today, we started the post mortem. It appears that a rod let loose after spinning a rod bearing, taking out part of the oilpan and cylinder sleeve. The block, 2 rods and at least one piston are toast. emoticon_cry",

Not close enough to live with another 'Vette, but close. \n\n \n I have a 396 stroked LT-1 with Callies crank, Manley rods, JE Pistons, big cam, etc., in the same year car as my son's but it'll never come close to the performance of a similarly equipped LS motor because the LS heads flow so much better than the LT-1. The most expensive LT-1 heads flow about the same as stock LS heads, IIRC. I'd never put another LT-1 motor in my car if this one gives up the ghost and this motor has been together for 7 years now without any problems. The heads make the power and the LS heads are lightyears better than previous generations. \n \n\n If he's after a dealer of anything GM partial sponsorship, if they have some co-op advertising money available, I'd shoot for the LS7.

In a 94Z28, you have to do a lot of \"metal finessing\" to get a big block in and keep the car from becoming front heavy.\n My son was considering a Shaffirof big block before he went for the twins. I'm a fan of cubes, too, but it's nice to dial in a specific power level via a computer.emoticon_xgood",
