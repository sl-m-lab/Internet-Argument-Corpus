In dynamical systems, an attractor is a technical term for a set of points invariant under the dynamics of the system (like fixed points only applied to a set of points) and nearby points get grabbed into the attractor (the technical term for this is that the nearby points are in the basin of attraction of the attractor).\n \n Lorenz attractor is a specific type of attractor in a specific system (namely, the system described by Lorenz equations). (x,y,z) in Lorenz equations aren't (x,y,z) spatial coordinates. They represent thermal variables in the system (x = convection intensity, yada yada). \n \n (sigma,r,b) are parameters that you can adjust to move the attractor around (they are parameters in Lorenz equation). There are some equations that people worked out that give some meaning to these parameters (I won't go into details because I don't remember the details :)\n \n Stiff is a technical term -- it describes a specific type of PDE :)\n \n Anyway, I would write more, but he probably figured out how to do it.",
