   "By 365gay Newscenter Staff\n 03.31.2009 3:14pm EDT\n \n (San Mateo, California) A Northern California family is expected to be torn apart on Friday when Shirley Tan is scheduled to be deported back to the Philippines, leaving behind her life partner and their 12 year old twin sons.\n \n Tan and Jaylynn &#8220;Jay&#8221; Mercado were married in San Francisco in 2004. Their marriage was voided, but even if it still were in effect the federal Defense of Marriage Act prevents Mercado from sponsoring her partner of 23 years for immigration.\n \n Were the women a married opposite-sex couple, Tan could be legal.\n \n &#8220;From the moment my sons were born we have never been apart. It&#8217;s tearing me apart to have to leave without them,&#8221; said Tan.\n \n Legislation was re-introduced in Congress last month that would allow Americans in a same-sex relationship to sponsor their &#8220;permanent partners&#8221; for legal residency in the United States.\n \n The Uniting American Families Act was filed in the House by Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and in the Senate by Sen. Patrick Leahy.\n \n With Democrats now in Control of the Congress and the White House LGBT advocates are hopeful the measure will become law.&#8217;\n \n &#8220;Shirley Tan&#8217;s unacceptable situation is just one example of why Congress must pass immigration equality legislation. The Uniting American Families Act, which I co-sponsored, will allow lesbian and gay Americans to sponsor their permanent partners for residency in the United States,&#8221; said Rep. Jackie Speier, one of 110 cosponsors.\n \n &#8220;In the near term, I am confident that any official who examines the facts in Shirley Tan&#8217;s case will come to the conclusion that this hard-working mother of two should not be sent to a country where she has no support network and was the victim of a horrific act of violence.&#8221;\n \n &#8220;Until the UAFA passes, families like Jay and Shirley&#8217;s are at terrible risk,&#8221; said Immigration Equality Executive Director Rachel B. Tiven. &#8220;We are hopeful their members of Congress will introduce a private bill that would spare their twin boys and the boys&#8217; grandmother from having the country they love tear their family apart.&#8221;\n \n It is doubtful though that any legislation could be passed before the Friday deadline.\n \n Across the country, 37,000 couples face similar circumstances.\n \n Last week, the White House issued a statement about the Uniting American Families Act, saying &#8220;[President Obama] thinks Americans with partners from other countries should not be faced with a painful choice between staying with their partner or staying in their country.&#8221;\n \n Victoria Neilson, Immigration Equality&#8217;s Legal Director, stated, &#8220;There may be no options for Jay and Shirley under existing law. How can they explain to their children that the U.S. Government does not consider them a family?&#8221;\n \n \n So Dobson, Robertson, and all the remaining neocons out there who claim to \"protect\" families, see what you've done?",

   "Just out of curiousity, do any of the people who are detracting from the point of this thread ON THE GAY FORUMS even have any clue as to her history and how she came to this country in the first place?\n Plenty on accusations and innuendo. Little on actual substantiated fact.\n Tan applied for political asylum in 1995, and thought her case was still pending, until immigration officials knocked on her door this January. She told the San Jose Mercury News that her former lawyer never told her a deportation order was issued in 2002. Her bid for asylum failed because the threat to her life in the Philippines came from a relative -- who shot her in the head when she was young over an inheritance battle -- instead of from the government. Lesbian Mother Faces Deportation &#160;|&#160;News | Advocate.com\n \n I see articles stating that they were together for 23 years, but no other real indication as to where this relationship has resided.\n \n At any rate, if heterosexual couples marrying for citizenship is considered a \"loop-hole\" to some, that's a new perspective that I haven't seen before.\n \n Instead of closing what some consider a \"loop-hole\", I think that we need to make the situation equal between gay couples and straight couples.\n If straight couples can marry for citizenship, then gay couples should have that capability also.",

This issues is not about your warped view of christianity. It is about a mother seeking a new life in this country. It is about that if she were strait she'd have no issue getting married and living in this country as a LEGAL citizen.\n \n The point is she has two boys and is trying to start a new life because her brother tried to kill her once he found out she was gay! The family has even said they would allow her to have a sex change to stay in the country!\n \n This is sick and wrong and deplorable. Thank you MR Dobson and such for \"protecting\" families by promoting yes on 8. Thanks to your decidion it's now 18000 couples and at least this family who has been fragmented by your political and warped views through your blinded religion.\n \n You don't give a damn about families, if you did you would see the pain and suffering these people go through daily due to your influence and propagandist message.",
