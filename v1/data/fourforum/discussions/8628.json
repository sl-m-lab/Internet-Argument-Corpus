   "Has anyone heard of the Mo Movie Measure? It says that a film is \"adequately feminist\" if:\n \n 1) It has two women\n 2) that talk to each other\n 3) about something other than a man.\n \n Seems like a pretty low standard, right? And yet when I look at some of my favorite movies...\n \n Star Wars: Never two speaking women in the same scene.\n Raiders of the Lost Ark: Only one woman with lines?\n Casablanca: I don't think two women ever talk to each other.\n \n How do other people's favorite movies do?",

   "\n How would these do? Also, do the list of 3 things do mean the movie is good or bad?\n\n \n I don't think good or bad is the point, per se. The idea is to illustrate what short shrift women get in movies. I never really noticed before until I applied what seems like a really low standard and saw how few films passed it. It seems like in movies the default gender is male, and you only use a woman if the script requires it. Not all movies, of course, but a surprising number.",

Eowyn has a pretty good fight against standard male roles, and I appreciate that.\n \n Other favorite movies of mine...Airplane!. No. Any Monty Python. No. Woody Allen movies? Eh...not really. Office Space? No. Trying to think of comedies that fit...having a hard time.\n \n Wow, even though these standards are low, there's not a lot of movies that I enjoy that fit the bill.
