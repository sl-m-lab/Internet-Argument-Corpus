Liberals get arrested for wearing peace t-shirts. They get arrested for protesting in the Side-Walks, The \"blocking roads\" excuse of the Conservatives is wrong, many don't block the roads yet they still get arrested. When they do block the roads, they get shot by rubber bullets. Why don't Anti-Liberal protesters get arrested when they block the road? I will tell you why, our Police Force hates Liberals. Arrested Anti-War protesters aren't even given the right to a trial before being locked in jail to be gang raped by other prisoners who also hate Liberals. Have you ever heard of the man who was arrested for refusing to take off a peace on Earth T-shirt. Can you believe Conservatives are offended by a T-shirt that support peace on Earth?\n \n We are victimized, just like the African-Americans were in the South East. The cops use concussion grenades against Liberals just for blocking the roads. The cops beat Liberals just for j-walking. The cops arrest Liberals for an entire night or more just because they were voicing their views. Fortunately for us, nobody can tell we are Liberal and Anti-War just by looking at us. Conservatives believe Liberals are treasones and should be punished for it. Conservatives oppose Clinton's actions, however they are not being traitors for that. But when Liberals oppose something Bush does, they call us a bunch of traitors who are dangerous to society. They think we are a bunch of terrorist lovers. Many Conservatives aren't smart enough to relize the difference between treason and viocing dissent. Conservatives see in black and white \"you are either on our side, or you are on their side.\" Conservatives think we are a bunch of Saddam lovers just because we questioned Bush's reasoning on the war. Conservatives think we support Osama Bin Laden just because we don't like how Bush is handeling this war on Terrorism. When we voice our dissent, Conservatives yell \"traitors!\" If you don't believe me, look around on the web, and mabey check some of Ann Coulter's statements as well.\n \n Under the Constitution, we have the right to vioce dissent at our Government. One reason America was made is so people can voice dissaproval of what the Country is doing and not be considered traitors. Its in the 1st Amendment. However John Ashcroft and many other Conservatives are denying us this. right.http://www.fascismsucks.org/CA%20Shields%20Protestors.htm\n Ashcroft has sent Federal spies on us. Liberals are considered treasones for being critical on Bush's \"War on Terrorism.\" Sometimes loving your Country means oppossing a regime that you dissagree with. http://www.evilgopbastards.com/teddybanner.jpg Conservatives accuse us Liberals of denying the Constitution, however it is they who do so. http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Amend.html",

   "Hey Morfos,\n \n I agree that the attacks on people who voice dissent in the US is terrible. It isn't, unfortunately, particularly new. Everything bad that happens to Americans or American interests is opportunistically used as an excuse to clamp down on dissent- it has been happening since the creation of the US nation-state. Every war the US has involved itself in has been accompanied by the same tactics of repression.\n \n It's almost a feudal model- the gov't says put up with us, and we'll protect you from the bad guys (commies, terrorists, whatever...). Or think of it like the mob- they'll \"protect\" you, for a price, and even then, not really.\n \n Unfortunately, the US was not founded on the ideas of liberty, democracy, etc. It is just a fairy tale story told to little kids so they will listen and be good. \n \n The fact is, that the \"Founding Fathers\" were not idealists, but very pragmatically were protecting their own interests when wording such documents as the Constitution. If you follow the history of the creation of the US, you will find a group of settlers trying to protect the property they had acquired (land by destroying First Nations, labour by enslaving Africans), and largely fighting amongst themselves. They were factionists, and so things like \"freedom of the Press\", if you investigate the factors at play, were written into law in order to preserve a faction's power or attack a rival faction.\n \n Any argument as to whether or not the \"Founding Fathers\" dreamt of democracy and liberty for all would have to explain away such things as the fact that very few citizens had the right to vote (not at all democratic), or the incredibly repressive Alien and Sedition Act (which goes against any idea of liberty).\n \n No, the \"Founding Fathers\" were interested in liberty and democracy for themselves and those like them only. Not the Native people whose land they had stolen, neither the kidnapped and enslaved Africans, nor the poor landless whites, or even their own wives.\n \n That is not to say that such repressive policies should not be fought. And I also think it is important to point out the enormous chasm between state rhetoric and reality. It's just really important to recognise that resistance has always existed and has always met repression. We should not be surprised or dissuaded by it. It's just part of the process.",

   "Our civil rights have been slowly eroded. \n \n It always gives me a little chuckle to hear the liberals complain about this, though, since they did a large part of the eroding. Burden of proof has shifted in many cases from the government to the accused because the liberals wanted the BATF to be able to get the gun fanatics. Now this is being slowly transfered to other types of cases.\n \n Liberals decry the second amendment as \"outdated\" and do their best to explain it away, but hold te first amendment as some kind of sacred birthright. \n \n Thomas Jefferson once said that the second amendment was the one upon which all others rested (paraphrasing). Maybe people should have listened a little better. The liberals pitch a fit when mistreated by their government, but call the conservativs who keep arms in order to assure they are not mistreated by their government \"paranoid\".\n \n \nI would agree that the articles you posted show an absolute outrage. Personally, I believe in protecting our rights, and that means ALL of our rights. The fact is, that the \"Founding Fathers\" were not idealists, but very pragmatically were protecting their own interests when wording such documents as the Constitution. If you follow the history of the creation of the US, you will find a group of settlers trying to protect the property they had acquired (land by destroying First Nations, labour by enslaving Africans), and largely fighting amongst themselves. They were factionists, and so things like \"freedom of the Press\", if you investigate the factors at play, were written into law in order to preserve a faction's power or attack a rival faction.\n\n \n \n Interesting theory. OF course, it is an absolut load of bunk. The freedom of press in the bill of rights was a direct response to british censorship during the years leading up to the revolutionary war. You are right about one thing, the founding fathers were not idealists, they were realists. It maight be interesting to note (though it does not fit in very well with your conspiracy theory) that the bill of rights was not originally included in the constitution, it was added later at the insistence of the public, which was unwilling to allow a constittution without a bill of rights. \n \n \nAny argument as to whether or not the \"Founding Fathers\" dreamt of democracy and liberty for all would have to explain away such things as the fact that very few citizens had the right to vote (not at all democratic), or the incredibly repressive Alien and Sedition Act (which goes against any idea of liberty).\n\n \n Of course, at the time even the \"very few\" that were given the right to vote was a radical improvement over the numbers that were able to vote before (whihc would have been...uh....nobody).\n \n \n \nNo, the \"Founding Fathers\" were interested in liberty and democracy for themselves and those like them only. Not the Native people whose land they had stolen, neither the kidnapped and enslaved Africans, nor the poor landless whites, or even their own wives.\n\n \n At the time, blacks and indians weren't considered \"people\" they were savages. We can argu all day about wheter the founding fathers should have looked past this and se theri own rules, but it would be pretty pointless. This is just the way it was. IF, in a hundred years we find that dolphins and dogs are actually intelligent creatures,should we be villified for not realising it today and giving them the right to vote? I think not.\n \n \nI agree that the attacks on people who voice dissent in the US is terrible. It isn't, unfortunately, particularly new. Everything bad that happens to Americans or American interests is opportunistically used as an excuse to clamp down on dissent- it has been happening since the creation of the US nation-state.

Or think of it like the mob- they'll \"protect\" you, for a price, and even then, not really.\n\n \n I think you are right on target here. Who was it that said \"Those that would trade liberty for security are deserving of neither\" ?\n \n THe problem is, every time a threat comes up, they take a little, then a littl more, then a little more. Eventually, we will have nothing left. YOu liberals out there can all just keep in mind that it is all for the safety of \"the children\" and feel good about it. Of course, we will be raising those children to live in a police state, but at least they will be safe.",
