   "From the chief anglocentric shaman of the \"invisible (white) hand\" Smith, who projected the notorious stinginess / cruelty of his fellow scots onto the world population, to that genius lunatic Friedman, the narcotic of the freemarket has been pushed onto the witless addicted masses for generations.\n \n The Blinding Fraud of Pure Economics or Freemarkets\n According to narcissistic economists solitarily beating their logarithms and algorithms in their lab corners (Chicago School of Economics, Carnegie Institute), the whole world can be 'structurally adjusted' by a calculator: if only the market was free of DISTORTIONS, they feverishly ejaculate! This is the Golden Mean of 'scientific' economics.\n \n The cardinal ingredient of the freemarket and the junk science of economics is of course the holy variable of self-interest. This mostly anglo (Smithian) principle is worshiped by all rightwing / pure economists, (all of whom are naturally fat and wanting for nothing except a social consciousness) who fantasize of a world where self-interest is freed from the inhibiting forces of market distortions, e.g. social security, minimum wage, incubators for newborns, subsidized medicines etc. Remove such distortions they claim, and after a little compulsory bloodletting the market will find its equilibrium with the quirky white plump invisible hand revealing itself.\n \n The problem / fraud with this doctrine is of course, any psychotic economist ala Friedman will insist the hated State must retain the appendages of police and army to keep the freemarket free by stomping on the victims of the 'freemarket'! Can you see the hypocrisy, the fraud, the distortion!\n \n If free market forces are to be truly free in the libertarian nirvana, then the freemarket force of resistance by the masses struggling for their own SELF-INTEREST must not be distorted by the boot and baton of the very distorted and manufactured variable of military and police violence.\n \n Can you now see the astronomical lie of Friedman's freemarket forces: stand down your military / police stooges and cast them back among the poor masses, and then introduce the freemarket. It is guaranteed you Chicago School of psychotics, the market will truly be free, and the most left leaning loopy poor panhandler will embrace this freemarket.\n \n And as for Keynes, that bleeding heart bourgeoisie, as with all who squat quivering in between the lines, he was part of the problem.",

The breakup of AT&T and deregulation of banking, transportation, and telecom. \n \n 23 years later, AT&T is again the largest telecom provider in the U.S. All other industries that enjoyed deregulation have either melted down somewhere along the way or failed to deliver the divined lower prices to consumers. And customer service has declined. \n \n Would airlines be in so much trouble without the deregulation of the early 80's? Would our communications system be any worse? Would we not be more secure with certain strategic assets managed by the federal government (i.e., the power grid, our ports, etc.?)\n \n Shouldn't the notion of mixed markets that include controls to prevent the smartest guys in the room from screwing everyone else also include a little national security consideration? Isn't the security of our economy our number one goal? In order to preserve it, don't we logically have to concede the shortcomings of the free market? \n \n Conversely, or perhaps complimentarily, shouldn't we allow weak corporations to fail so that stronger, better managed competitors can assume their positions in the marketplace? Shouldn't a market striving for optimum health naturally eschew any sort of corporate welfare?\n \n There is still plenty of room for the entrepreneur in such a market, and as many millionaires will likely result.

Im not rich but I don't begrudge those who are, I strive to become one someday. You sound like sour grapes and have presented no solutions only complaints. I believe you have a skewed grasp of reality.\n\n \n Ibelieveyou thinks we should destroy all markets? I don't think so either. Innovation comes from adversity. And extreme free market types are really looking for anarchy (not chaos, in which no one would profit except through force.)\n \n I don't believe in communism. It is contrary to human nature. But in some regards, so is capitalism, in that what we feel for others is often quashed by the desire for wealth and power. What we all really want is personal freedom. Logically, a system in which our security is paramount (nationalization of strategic assets,) our health is maintained (single payer healthcare,) and entrepreneurship is still encouraged in remaining industries (which are the vast majority of our economy) would be ideal.\n \n I base this on the following.\n \n 1. The people who control the wealth of a nation have directly benefited from the efforts of the people of that nation to protect their ability to accumulate it in the first place, therefore they owe the most in return in order to safeguard it. \n \n 2. The top causes of personal bankruptcy in this country are catastrophic disease resulting in huge medical bills that may or may not be coupled with loss of healthcare coverage. \n \n 3. Our ports, our power grid, and our borders are no more secure than they were before 9/11. \n \n 4. Our economy is as reactionary as our population, swinging wildly from one extreme to another. Capital managers seek the next bubble, only to watch it collapse in the next wave of rabid overlending or outright fraud. This costs all of us, even those of us who knew better than to get involved, through another government bailout package for another failed industry.\n \n These issues can no longer be denied by the ruling elites. The people are tired of footing the bill to preserve the financial empires of the rich without realizing a fair return on their own investment.\n \n Nothing in the Constitution precludes us from achieving any of what I recommend. And in fact, the Declaration of Independence supports it directly by stating that we all have the right to life (healthcare) liberty and the pursuit of happiness (freedom from fear, and free markets too.) Do you see? Elements of social democracy are fully capable of being integrated with (but not replacing) our current republic.\n \n The rich are doing what they do best, and we shouldn't stop them, but they must be held accountable for their impact on our economy. We can't all be rich, Son. That is the false promise of capitalism: That would result in incredible inflation, and we'd be back where we started. This economy needs losers to show us who the winners are, as does life itself. I just don't think so many should be in fear for their lives in order to keep the system up and running, and the winners shouldn't be the ones who got away with murder.",

I simply asked where is was located and why he hadn't gone there yet. I see he still hasn't answered.\n\n It looks like he was misquoting SinJin, transferring \"system\" to \"class.\" Pardon my perturbed response, I was agreeing with him from that perspective, not referring to \"system,\" \"society,\" or \"nation.\"\n \n All extremes leave someone out in the cold, communism in theory would be chaos, and Libertarianism would be chaos as well, since human nature would usurp order. Corporate warfare would ensue as they become the only political entities remaining. Under communism, you would revert to tribal and clan warfare, which would give rise to city-states either way, we come back to the reason we \"provide for the common defense\" and \"promote the general welfare\" in the first place. Empires would grow. We'd come full circle eventually. \n \n Marx was right in pointing out the flaws in capital markets, but the answer is in between, not on the other end. Certain aspects of our current system are simply not viable, and only continue at the expense of those that are. Everything subsidizes everything else, but it is horribly wasteful, and many still go without for that reason. It doesn't have to be that way. \n \n What do you think? Why do you suppose that we cannot partially or completely socialize just a few industries and resources, while maintaining our vast \"free\" market? It seems to me that an increase in productivity and all-important consumer spending would result, which would be a boon to American business, would it not? Since we're the greatest nation, why can't or why shouldn't we do it? I'm personally insulted to hear that America \"cain't\" do something, aren't you? Why can't we be an even \"more greatest\" nation?",

   "We can't leave the kids alone in the candy store anymore. We can't let them take the rent to the casino along with their allowance. Do you understand what I'm saying? There need to be strict definitions of what is essential to our existence as a people, and those boundaries must be protected. Electricity, communications, transportation, natural resources must be safe from foreign assault as well as corporate rape. Then we will be happy healthy and secure, and free to make money the old fashioned way.\n \n In the 80's, the top tax bracket was at 50%. We had a healthy period of growth, and again after the recession for another decade. We didn't need tax cuts then, so why do we need them now? I think it was a good idea only because of 9/11; if that hadn't happened, what good would the tax cuts have done? They would have revealed themselves to be a disaster, except that the war stole the spotlight. They have been a disaster, especially because of the war.\n \n Everyone forgot that we were even in a recession. It didn't just go away. The housing bubble came as a result, same thing happened in the 80's on a smaller scale. Why did everyone and their mother jump into real estate? Because there was not much of an alternative in terms of real return on their investment. The tech bubble spoiled them rotten.\n \n Yet if that difference between the 50% they were paying and the 35% they pay now that disappeared into the pockets of the wealthiest Americans had made it into infrastructure instead, private investment would have simply followed suit: they go where the money already is, they don't invent the stuff. Those are good jobs and good projects for everyone. That would have saved us all money in the long run.\n \n We're told by the people who waste the most money (OUR money) that we should save our remainder, but at the same time that we need to be good consumers and \"stimulate\" the economy every chance we get. I'll tell you what, give me healthcare, give me a safe and healthy place to live, and a place to ply my skills and I'll contribute more to society than someone who has to fight for those things and gets into trouble doing so, looking for a shortcut (to becoming rich, as if it's truly possible for everyone,) and getting caught doing something wrong, becoming A BURDEN ON THE REST OF US so that the guy who builds prisons can get richer on more of OUR money. \n \n If I were Australian and had six months off I'd have gladly gone to Southeast Asia to help rebuild after the tsunami, or to New Orleans to rebuild after Katrina, but I'm not so I can't afford to care about it, and New Orleans sits unfinished to this day, and all the money is gone. \n \n I'm much too busy worrying about when I'm going to get cancer to stop smoking, much less am I able to help anyone else who needs it.

Or how nationalised industries would function at all without the dreaded tool of \"capital accumulation\".\n \n Come back when you are interested in saying something positive, not merely deconstructing other people's posts ad nauseum\n \n I can't even figure out why you're carping on about \"neocons\", when you're arguing for almost exactly the same program they are, which is vastly increased government power in the name of \"security\" coupled with vast expenditure on welfare.\n \n We give over our freedom in the name of security at airports, and it's quite a nice little show, but our country is no more secure. There are ways of really achieving it, not just pretending. Again, I don't care what happens in your country, and I didn't ask, you please don't offer your uninformed opinion. CUNxTime clearly showed his true colors here, responding to any other viewpoint as leftist. Does this offend you? Do you want to help the right eliminate the term to better your image? It has such negative connotations here.\n \n \n Of course, you do not address that which is directed at you at all. A champion debater. Tell me, are you a senator?\n \n By the way CUNxTime, I can see why this would make you happy, as you now have a champion, which is what you were hunting for in me. I can tell you that I would gladly fight at your side when we are invaded by Australians, provided that you are in fact American, and not just another foreign pseudo-intellectual chiming in. \n \n I'm sorry for hijacking this thread, I had no idea that liberal hunting was so popular around here. Tell you what, I'll just start doing what you two do, I'll just hang back and say nothing of value, and attack other posters' points of view by putting words in their mouths, and associating them with genocidal political movements.\n \n I'll keep my views private, while ripping down all others. Of course, it may lead others to believe that I in fact have no views of my own, but if I shout loud enough for long enough that they are wrong for having them, I will be superior. Congrats! I'm one of you now.",

My posts are about people pulling themselves up and being handed everything on a silver plater. Give a man a fish you feed him for a day. Feed a man for half his life, You'll be stuck feeding him for the other half of his life!!!\n\n \n This is why you p!$s me off, assuming stuff. And this is where the assumptions begin, when I disagree with you on one point. I'm not for open borders, I'm not for welfare. I do believe that our workforce is a strategic asset, and must be protected, just as our heavy industries should be, but it must be in a way that is fair to everyone, as sure as we should not get into extreme protectionism to save those industries.\n \n Like Symbiote, you are reading things that aren't there, and that's the root of this disagreement. I simply believe that as evidenced by their behavior, corporations WILL take every opportunity to \"push the envelope\" of what is ethical and/or legal in their quest to increase share prices, and earn their bonuses. I think that is human nature, which is what LAWS are meant to protect us from. I am for control, not elimination of markets. I also believe that welfare in the form of tax breaks, protectionist tarrifs, etc., should be minimal, so that the markets are open to more real competition. This also frees up government resources, you follow? \n \n Now, I'm not for welfare for people other than those in transition (unemployment, workers comp and such.) I believe our economy was better in the 90's because of the opportunity for small business back then, most importantly the total dollars available for the average consumer to spend as a percentage of income. I don't know why you think I'd be for the dole for everyone just because I believe healthcare should be reorganized into single payer. \n \n If I could give an analogy to American industry, it would be organic farming. Organic farmers produce a healthier product by spending more on labor than chemicals, and as they become more popular, they get cheaper. We need to tend our labor \"crop\" to get a better product for the same cost. \n \n Healthcare costs are killing the profits of American businesses and the savings of the American people. It is forcing people to \"choose\" lower paying jobs with better benefits in some instances, limiting their other spending \"choices.\" Single payer would level the playing field, and small businesses and sole proprietorships can be excluded from the business tax at first, so that family businesses won't be hurt at all. If you currently provide healthcare for your employees, your cost would be the same anyway, that is the point. The smallest business would benefit from healthy employees at no extra cost. \n \n What I'm angry about is the lack of a logical argument against it. It is all rhetorical. There are all sorts of people with no stake in the argument coming out against it, and many whose lot would be improved by it still are against it, for reasons I cannot fathom. I believe that the founding fathers were alive today they would be for it, as they likely never imagined the situation to become what it is, anymore that they imagined eating at a McDonald's in Shanghai. \n \n Who is our real competition in the world? Don't the other \"first world\" nations give their people the right access healthcare equally? Symbiote isn't even an American, what the hell does he care? Does Symbiote want to see America continue to decline so his \"dollars\" will buy things of equal value here?\n \n Christ, man, if you get rich like you want to, you'd still be able to buy supplemental insurance, like for elective surgeries, extra employment insurance if you're hospitalized for an extended period, and things of that nature. You'll still be able to get yourself the Gold package, so don't worry about giving anything up, it's not going to go away if there is a market for it. And there will be.",

   "Taxi Rob, Concerning you 'long' post a few posts back... We you put it like that, I see we do in fact agree about a lot of stuff. And actually I've seen that in some of your other posts. However, the first thread I came to on this website (I joined 2 or 3 days ago) had you screaming about the terrible destructive system guided by the white man's hand. You sounded like an anarchist and a radical lunitic...maybe you were trying to prove a point, since MOST of your posts aren't like that. But you have to admit, there are a lot of radicals out there that want to tear the system apart and your post sounded a lot like that. As a conservative/libertarian if feel its important to fight against the 'tyranny of the majority'. I've watched good SMALL ideas be corrupted by Govt. and turned into huge insidious programs with bloated bureaucracies. I don't believe in laissez faire markets, but nor do I believe in socialism. I believe in taking care of those that are dispossessed by the system even A. Smith said that at least 5% unemployment was necessary in a capitalist system and I agree. However, I lived in the 'ghetto' for a long time and believe me I've seen what happens when there is a system that encourages people to give up and allow govt. to fend for them.\n We do agree on a lot of things and yes, Social Security is important and Medicare (although we Definitely differ in opinion as to how 'healthy' that program is) and defense and even food stamps and unemployment. But its easy for people to say 'its not fair' that 'THEY' make so much and by necessity there will always be more people, numbers wise, in the middle and lower parts of the pay scale and the last thing that I think would help the country or the PEOPLE in the long run would be to take away the incentive and confiscate the wealth and private property of those at the top. I'm a small business owner and a writer, I've been POOR (free lunch and all that) but I believe its work and effort not govt. that will allow me to reach the upper quintiles of the pay scale...\n \n By the way, Jo, I talk to lots of Canadians (they come to Myrtle Beach and stay in the condos we take care of) and there is PLENTY of rationing both there and in the UK (104 y/o woman waiting 18 months for a hearing aid). I'm not saying let people die on the street. But there is a big portion of those that don't have insurance because they don't want to pay for it. They could but don't, either because they are young etc, or they just want to buy other things...I'm an example of that. It would be tough but we could afford it at least part of the year but we just don't. I don't have health insurance and we just found out the my wife need IVF to get pregnant, should have gotten it earlier but didn't. Whose fault is that if not mine? I wouldn't show up at someone's house and say-hey pay for my wife's IVF cause we bought a new car instead of health insurance...",

If something bad were to happen and you needed a complicated and expensive procedure to maintain your wife's health, or that of your unborn child, or yourself for that matter, why should the bills render you bankrupt? It sounds to me like you contribute to society and obey the law, yes? You are also an entreprenuer? \n \n The current neo-con ideal is that those captains of industry who sit at the apex of most of the capital in this country are then assumed to be our most important personnel, yet when they falter, we (as in the rest of us) are expected to bail them (their companies) out. Why don't we make sure that the most capable and wise are in fact in charge by letting the market swallow up the stuffed shirts and chair warmers who merely talk the talk or \"know the right people?\" \n \n The Ken Lays of the world can eat a bowl of d!@#$ in Hell. They are already rich, so when they screw up a company and leave the government to bail it out for the sake of the market, it cheeses me off. They rarely pay for it. The ultra rich don't want stricter regulations to prevent these things from happening. Why? Because they might be seen for the frauds that they are. \n \n Yet the strong and secure society behind that market that they exploited for their personal gain is more to thank for that wealth than they are. They owe more in taxes to keep it that way. This also gives more people the opportunity into that market with fresh ideas, keeping it healthy for all. \n \n Imagine if you did lose your savings to a medical bill. Single payer would force you to be responsible, wouldn't it? The way things are, if something bad did happen, you might be back to those school lunches for your kid. And since you are an entreprenuer who probably has no unemployment insurance (are you subchapter S or a proprietorship/dba?) what if you couldn't work? You'd have to get some sort of welfare, but to take health care out of the equation would free up money for your own employment insurance, not in reality, but because your priorities would change if you had health care. You'd look at things much differently. \n \n As far as what employment insurance or income assurance I speak of, currently it is available as a hedge bet on credit cards and various other financial products, and would be widely available if insurers were out of the health care game. There would be a new insurance industry as it became necessary. The market would demand it, and so it would happen. \n \n Why do insurers whine about being pushed out of the health care market when they are free and welcome to invest in new products? Good old fashioned American laziness. And also the fear that they may be found out as the frauds that they are. \n \n That they may or may not be white is incidental.

Like I said, I have so far CHOSEN not to sacrifice other things to have health insurance. If I had to go into the hole to save my wife (no kids yet because I can't afford IVF so that my wife can get pregnant) I would, no doubt. If the govt. raised taxes too much for a universal health care, I'd be out of business (sole prop.) since our margin is so small. THEN I'd end up bankrupt. But if I'm hurt and someone needs to go bankrupt why shouldn't it be me? Besides, we'd have to pay for health care one way or another. With universal coverage, the quality would go down, taxes would go up, and we'd still be paying (probably more since the govt. is so wasteful.\n \n I think Ken Lay is in jail.

These are human lives they are playing with for profit!\n \n Do you think \"anyone with a mutual fund\" benefits when their stocks tank? Don't you realize or remember what happened with the savings and loan debacle? Those people pay the price, man, look it up. I'm not making this stuff up. Many funds collapsed with the tech bubble, and that's why we prosecute the Ken Lays of the world. \n \n Did you think that the 401ks were safe from losses when they were tech heavy in the late 90's? Have you ever had a 401k? Do you know how they work? That is what regulation is for, TO PROTECT THE AVERAGE JOE INVESTOR, not to punish anyone unless they screw up! Jeez, what is with you?",

   "We need to continue to grow at a rate that can support all those coming into the job market and so that the system can continue to support ever increasing numbers of baby boomers reaching retirement. Over taxation is a certain way to make sure that this doesn't happen...\n\n Here's where things get sticky. Who are all those coming into the job market exactly? We don't exactly know, do we? At what rate are they coming into the job market and at what number? What is their education level, and at what level of our economy will they be entering? \n \n Who said we have to care about them at all? Because in your dog-eat-dog world of pure capitalism, no one should, least of all you, who seeks to reign over others with your prized economic power.\n \n I believe your heart and mind are divergent on these issues.

   "First of all, look who's jumping to conclusions with MY 'dog eat dog'. I've said again and again, I'm not for Laissez Faire. And, my friend, you don't have to be stinking rich to 'benefit' from the system. We all benefit from the system every day. Have you ever been to Mexico, like the real Mexico? They don't have our 'system' there and you'd never believe how they live. Our 'system' makes our poor people the envy of 2/3 of the rest of the world. Even our poor get to 'take advantage of the system'. Most have cable, they all have cell phones, and a $4 a month apartment.\n You can't honestly believe the everyone is not benefiting from our country's wealth. Perhaps not 'equally' but why should everything be equal? Does everyone work as hard? No. Is everyone equally smart? Hell, no.\n \n I care very much about my fellow humans. I give what I can to charity. I volunteer, teaching illiterate adults to read and work on homes for habitat. But that doesn't change the fact that I believe people should not be punished for excelling. I, fundamentally believe, that people should be responsible for themselves. If you make the govt. into a paternalistic entity that seeks to outlaw failure, society will deteriorate. \n I honestly believe that we've been encouraging entire segments of society to stay poor and uneducated as a direct result of entitlement programs. I've seen it first hand when I was growing up poor. People must learn to fend for themselves or they become wards of the state and their kids do and on and on. Don't get me wrong, I've said it before and I'll say it again, I don't want to see anyone starving to death, but if you make it unnecessary for a person to strive for anything, many will strive for nothing.\n I'm certainly not part of 'the ruling class' but I've got some nice things. I've worked hard for everything I have and will continue to work hard. I know many, many people who don't give a S#%t about their job or saving money or buying a house. As a previous restaurant manager, you'd better believe I met plenty. Are they automatically entitled to possess an equal amount of 'things' I have by the nature of their very existence? Should the govt. seize my things and give it to the guy who calls in sick to work 2 days a week?\n If I was a farmer and worked hard all year to grow my crops, would it be right for you to come into my barn and take half of my crops and give it to people who decided to hang out at the bar all day?\n Again, I'm all for food stamps and schip and etc. for people who need it for a period of time, but just like taking an animal out of the wild and turning it into a pet, if you make it unnecessary for someone to care about earning a living many won't.\n \n And it is about punishment, with BH talking about ultra high tax rates and etc. It is about punishing success. This whole 'hate business' attitude that seems to be prevalent. Not only on this thread, but on many threads and in the greater realm of the current public debate. Hillary wants to punish the credit card companies and TAKE the profits of the gas co. I'll tell you what, this is the slow time of the year for us and I've been living off my credit cards for the last 2 months waiting for the season to start again. Nobody made me do it. I could go out and get a part time job. I've got to be responsible for myself. And when we get busy again, I'll pay off the CC. Do I have any sympathy for people who run up their Credit cards at the bar and then whine that they can't pay them? Hell, no.\n Again, I'm all about helping people when they need it. Buy you can't let the safety net turn into a hammock! People ARE and should be responsible for themselves, those who aren't should have to suffer some kind of consequences or they won't learn. \n And as far as my signature goes, why are you jumping to conclusions? I applies to a specific argument I had with a specific person. I don't label everyone socialist who disagrees with me. Only the one's who'd like to create a nanny state to anesthetize its citizens into mediocrity.",

   "Gas company profits prove they are raping us. Cost of crude is not proportional to price of pump gas. \n \n Their profits should be redirected into alternative energy and mass transit for the benefit of EVERYONE, both from a national security standpoint and an economic stability argument. This should be done with incentive, and some might see it as punishment, and HRC might rattle the sword, but that is more likely how it would play out.\n \n No one is entitled to an equal amount of \"things.\" They are no less worthy of basic health care.\n \n Lots of people don't care about working hard or owning a home, not necessarily both. I have friends who are very successful, yet have no desire to own in the bloated San Diego market. Others I know are happy with surviving, yet are no burden on anyone else. When they have health problems they become a burden on the system, because their jobs have no benefits. Why is what they do making them of less value as human beings? They support themselves and go to work too, why shouldn't that contribution be valued? Where is their benefit?\n \n Cost of living in Mexico is lower than it is in America. \n \n Mexicans don't enjoy our infrastructure and that is what keeps their standard of living lower. That is a result of their political system, and that is their problem. I don't care about Mexico, I've said it before and I'll say it again. They have the means to change their country. We did it, so can they. \n \n We had a 50% tax bracket through the Reagan years as well as the Clinton administration, and enjoyed a robust economy.\n \n So why do we need to keep Bush's tax cuts while our deficit grows? You can talk about federal spending, but the war SURE ain't helpin, and besides that what happened during the Republican controlled Congress? The same damn thing. (Now's when you tell me you are a conservative independent rather than a Republican, right? That you don't condone what they do, while you advocate what they say?)\n \n The richest people in America saw their tax rate go from 50% down to 35%.\n \n That's a hell of a lot of money. What tax revenues have gone up that you talk about? Corporate taxes? Gas taxes? Sales taxes? Corporate taxes are at fixed lower rates in most states. Gas taxes are earmarked for transportation projects. Sales taxes don't make their way into the federal coffer. \n \n Do you really think that personal tax rate cuts translate into direct investment into the types of technologies and programs that this country actually needs? I bet Mercedes-Benz' profits go up when taxes are cut, but what about the capital that American industry needs to maintain our productivity and keep jobs from leaving for China? There is no guarantee that the capital remains within the U.S. economy. If it did, why did Ohio lose a quarter million jobs since 2000? \n \n You want to continue to put the majority of American capital in the hands of those who only wish to accumulate more of it. They have no incentive to keep it in the U.S. economy. Maintaining higher tax rates, which would be no higher than historical tax rates during the greatest period of economic growth since the end of WWII, would keep a great deal of that capital within the U.S., help stabilize the dollar and fund those programs that you agree are vital, like funding transportation (crucial to continued growth and GREAT jobs for semi-skilled Americans,) maintaining infrastructure (again, good jobs,) help for the poor and transitional workers (often one and the same,) and help keep America secure. To continue to cast it adrift in the free market is to continue to roll the dice while the richest of the rich place their bets with OUR chips.\n \n We already threw in the towel with manufacturing, so if the service economy is to thrive and we are all to be made to work for the rich in service rather than production, and are therefore employed and paid completely by their fiat rather than by collective bargaining for a share of our product's value, we need to have a stable and secure country to do it in. Otherwise you and me and everyone else in the service sector's days are numbered. We are all more and more replaceable every day.",

   "I've got to take issue with you on several of your points. Firstly, the oil companies' profit MARGIN is not high. Who cares what their profit is, if their profit margin was 100%+ then yeah, I'd agree with you. But its not. The only entity with a high profit margin on gas is the govt. The govt. makes a tremendous amount more on a gallon of gas than the company that produces. Furthermore, where do those profits go? What's not put back into R & D goes to the shareholders, you know, those people with mutual funds and 401Ks. Like teachers and union workers.\n \n Now don't get me wrong, I'm all about developing alt. energy and those companies should receive tax breaks and etc. We should also drill for oil here and create more Nuc. Power. \n \n Also, I never said people should be denied care. Anyone in this country legal or not can go to the hospital and can not be turned away. But just to flatly say that everyone is entitled to something without commensurate responsibility is ridiculous. Between growing up poor and the work I've done with the illiterate, I've met plenty of people who only detract from the system with no intention of giving back. People who sell their food stamps, people who work for cash so they don't have to pay any taxes, people who rent their 'extra' kids out to others for more earned income credit. I'll never agree with you that people who are out to use and abuse the system should receive huge amounts of benefits that they didn't earn. Additionally, these benefits encourage them to not take a better job or get educated, because they'd lose their free ride. \n \n Should kids get health care? Sure, and they do. But this talk of sticking it to the rich is outrageous. The top 10% of income earners already pay 70% of the income taxes and that's with the tax cuts. The bottom 50% of household pay 3% of the total. \n http://www.ntu.org/main/page.php?PageID=6\n And you don't think that's enough? There is a disincentive to overly high tax rates and that's why your precious manufacturing jobs left. I'd say the ball's in your court, do you want the service jobs to leave to? Tax anything high enough and you'll get your wish, no more big bad corporations. Sock it to 'um baby!",

   "R&D is before profit, that is another specious argument. Profit is exactly that. Shareholders don't receive a dividend check with a note saying, 'oh, could you please let us keep some to do some research?' That's besides the fact that they own their own supply lines, so cost is what they say it is, Holmes.\n \n Welfare scammers should be penalized. Corporate welfare should end entirely.\n \n The bottom 50%'s 3% is a higher percentage of their yearly discretionary income than the top 2%'s. Were talking double digits to tenths. They pay more than their fair share by percentage of dollars that they are free to spend on whatever they choose. Their money is spoken for while the rich have more discretionary income which they may or may not invest a higher percentage of. How they spend it may or may not help the domestic economy. They also have more write-offs and loopholes, like writing off their Hummers as business vehicles while driving them to the country club.\n \n They have more freedom in this regard. Our system ensures this. They therefore owe more in taxes as our system gave them that opportunity. OUR system. Since it is issued by OUR government, it is OUR money. OUR freedom is not equal. OUR government was not supposed to allow people to BUY freedom.\n \n People at the bottom have less left at the end of the year after taxes, plain and simple. They need to be taken care of. THEY produce the products. THEY provide the services. THEY are OUR most important resource. Take ONE THING off the plate for them, and let more of them into the middle class. Let everyone have equal access to healthcare, without crushing bills that end up PUTTING THEM IN BANKRUPTCY AND ON WELFARE.\n \n Return tax rates to what they were in 2000, and we will still have plenty of rich people. I'd go so far as to predict that none of the rich will be rendered poor by the move. WE will enjoy more of the benefits of the system, most importantly infrastructure and security. \n \n Regulate business to prevent the rampant securities frauds and OUR 401k's will be safer. Give incentives to corporations that DO invest in the things America needs to survive the next century. We already give them incentives just to stay in the U.S., while in the end the market dictates where they go anyway. \n \n ====And while I have USELESS federal spending in mind, how about each and every one of you reminding your friends who don't vote that spending happens in Congress, and that as few as 50,000 votes are all it takes to elect a Congressmen in many cases, so don't be afraid to vote independent, and don't be cajoled into thinking it won't count.

And you made no comment on the most important parts of my argument about the 'evil oil companies' and that is the idea of Profit Margin. What of it?

How much went into R&D, and how much of the R actually went into D? \n \n I'd pay a moderate premium for American made products, and I don't believe that lenders should lend me anything, as my credit is ####.\n \n As to my mathematically impossible argument, I was specifically referring to discretionary or disposable income, which the poor and middle class have none or substantially less of. I know how to live cheap, don't get me wrong, and people acquiring debt they can't repay is too permissible and to entrenched in our culture, but that is for another thread.\n \n I'm not for bloated entitlements, I'm for the reforms of the late 90's going even further. I just happen to believe in single-payer health care. I have never been for Section 8, it never made any sense to me, except for the truly disabled. Maybe some welfare recipients should have their mammalian organs disabled. FHA and HUD loans are much more responsible programs.\n \n And I just can't wrap my head around the various Fair Tax proposals and examples. I just think that all income should be taxed in the year it is received/paid, we need a simple graduated tax based on percentile with arbitrary limits at both ends that we all can agree on, and lower deductions for additional subsequent offspring, to remove the cash bonus for reproducing.\n \n I'm even willing to go off the deep end and say that corporate tax should be eliminated, as long as write-offs for expenses follow suit. Shareholders/owners are taxed on the income they take from their businesses, so corporate taxes are double-taxation, but corporations won't give up their rights that stem from being seen legally as \"people.\"\n \n Back to human nature. You think that everyone that has fed at the entitlement trough wishes to continue to do so. This reinforces what I and our open-border, free-everything-for-everyone friends have been trying to tell you about corporate monopoly. You can't acknowledge one without the other. This aspect of human nature works at both ends of our economy. \n \n Lackluster, unimaginative, lazy- these are attributes of many of America's boardrooms as well as it's housing projects. The Aguirre brothers have been trying to point this out to the rest of us, and pro-business types want them tarred and feathered. Well, the secret's out, at least with some of us.\n \n Maybe if the Wobblies would have had their way, and maybe if it weren't for Taft-Hartley, the workers of America could have taken the opportunity to become partners in America's economic growth instead of being forced into an eternally adversarial relationship. A little Nationalism in the movement might have helped to temper the Socialism.",

About the most ignorant gimp I've met and stinking rich too boot. I'm sure that there's plenty of boardroom dumb-a@#$s as well. But still that doesn't make me hate that guy. It make me want to redouble my efforts and take his job. BTW, who are the Aguirre brothers?\n \n I also want to be clear, I don't think all people who need to use social programs turn into mindless zombies. But there is a danger that a person can and a percentage do. Just like there are unscrupulous business people and companies that break the rules, I say hang 'um high if they use unfair business practices or don't follow environmental regs. etc... We have a great system when the rules are respected and anyone who doesn't play by them should receive harsh enough treatment so that there will be a deterrent effect for others.\n \n As for Credit Card companies and etc... I think it is ridiculous that they let people build up 100K in debt and other examples we've seen. And they should lose that money if the client can't pay it back. However, the client is also responsible and they must pay the consequences. \n \n Now as far a discretionary income, I've got to say that even our 'poor' are rolling with a cell phone and fresh new clothes or whatever. Again, I'd have to say that 50% of the world's population would think they were in heaven if they were able to join the ranks of our 'poor'. Again, people sometimes do need help and I'm all for reasonable govt. programs. It's a fact that capitalism needs about a 5% unemployment rate to function properly. Anyone displaced by the system should receive benefits and training and education.\n \n As to THE Fair Tax, it would be a 23% embedded sales tax to replace the 22% embedded tax that's there now. Every citizen would receive a monthly 'prebate' check making it the only tax that would completely eliminate federal taxes on the lowest income bracket. It would replace all with holding (everyone would get their Whole paycheck), it would replace payroll taxes, allowing companies to pay more (this is why I can't have full time workers, well that and the fact that we're only busy 5 months a year), no more billions spent by the IRS in collections, no more billions spent on compliance, Right off the bat $13 trillion in off shore money comes back into the economy. Also, think about this. With no corporate tax, how many companies would Relocate to OUR country from the high tax countries! We'd have to open up the damn border!!!",
