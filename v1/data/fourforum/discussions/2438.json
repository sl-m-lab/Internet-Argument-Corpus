   "So what is Israel's excuse now?? Is it still safety? How again are they making Israel safer by turning refugees into refugees again? When will the cycle of displacement for the Palestinians end? When will IDF violence end? \n \n The Palestinians fought back this week under international law killing 13 soldiers, not one single Israeli civilian was targeted. Sadly I can't say it was same the other way around. Firing missiles into crowded areas, bulldozing homes and vowing to bulldoze hundreds more. Where is the democracy? Where is the decency? Where is the outcry against Israel? Instead we get Colin Powell to say that he's disappointed with the events, that the U.S. doesn't \"agree\" with what's going on. Well actions speak louder than words, isn't that what we tell Arafat?!?! Isn't that what we tell the Palestinians? \n \n These latest injustices will go unnoticed and the Palestinians will continue to be brutalized through lies of Security, to preserve a state that vows racism over democracy, bloodshed over humanity. Israel went forth as the sole aggressor against a people who were fighting for their land and for the rights of freedom. But yet not a pin drop in the press about the necessary actions that need to be taken against Israel. For a call to stop the machine that is destroying a repressed people. \n \n But equality, freedom, liberty, these fantasies only exist in the Western World. For the Palestinians with deteriorating conditions and tragedies a daily occurrence, all one can really do is hope that someday justice will be served. \n \n Remi",
