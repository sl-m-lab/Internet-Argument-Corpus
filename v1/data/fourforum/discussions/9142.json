It is time that the American people support those who want to take them out of this Iraqi mud,\" said Jaara, speaking to WND from exile in Ireland, where he was sent as part of an internationally brokered deal that ended the church siege. - WorldNetDaily \n\n \n http://www.americanconservativedaily.com/index.php?/archives/1814-You-Think-Im-Joking-When-I-Say-Terrorists-Support-Democrats.html",

Tradition is the same method of legislation that Tehran uses. And Pakistan. And Saudi Arabia. Government should get entirely out of marriage. \n \n \nYou'd rather have it go bankrupt when the Baby Boomers retire? I don't know the exact numbers, but since Social Security was enacted in the 1930s the number of workers for each retiree collecting benefits has fallen drastically. Without reform we will eventually reach a point where the working generation won't make enough to pay the pensions of the retired generation.\n\n \n SS is a giant socialist ponzi scheme that requires fresh meat. The payer to taker ratio is 2:1 now. It will be 1:1 real soon. Besides, we could go bankrupt in 8 weeks if the market for US gov\\'t debt dried up. Socialism is bad enough. Ponzi socialism is just a debacle.",

At no time when Reagan or GHWB was president did the Republican Party have a majority in the House of Representatives. Every single one of the Reagan/Bush budgets was enacted by a Democrat majority in the House. \n \n Apparently you think that the President is unable to influence Congress into spending how he wants. Perhaps you need to revist the past 6 years when that certaintly wasn\\'t the case.\n\n \n The President really has no power to influence Congress to not spend money. Usually the president is willing to let Congress spend whatever it wants just as long Congress appropriates money for whatever the President wants. \n \n \n\n As recently as 2001 we did have a balanced federal budget- but we also had a Republican majority in the House as well. The trouble is that once in power the Republicans took to spending like Democrats. \n \n Questionable at best. Federal accounting is shotty and virtually every accountant knows it. The fed budget doesn\\'t include things like Amtrack, or the Postal service, both of which are off the balance sheet and budget. Furthermore, the budget doesn\\'t take into account the massive unfunded liabilities that the Fed holds. So we\\'ve never really had a actual balanced budget, perhaps a paper one but that\\'s still quite a joke. \n\n \n True. Federal accounting would be illegal if done by a private citizen or corporation. But don't forget how your precious Social Security plays into fiscal policy. By law any money collected in Social Security taxes must be loaned to the federal government who then spends it like it was normal revenue.\n \n \n\n I guess you'd say the right to own slaves should have by state as well. \n \n Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes.

Deficit spending for the sake of paying welfare benefits is more likely to produce inflation (because welfare recipients tend to be unemployed- meaning they consume without producing in return). This was the situation in the late 1970s. Standard economic theory holds that you cannot have both high inflation and high unemployment because unemployment would reduce the amount of money available to cause inflation. But in 1979 and 1980 we had stagflation- unemployment and inflation. We had deficit spending in the late 1970s, but the deficit was made up by printing more money instead of borrowing.

How does the 4th Amendment prevent the cop from simply observing what you do and reporting it to the government?\n \n What about all of the cameras that now monitor public places- sidewalks, roads, public buildings? If there is no right to privacy what's to keep the government from putting a camera on public property at the end of your driveway so your comings and goings can be monitored? \n \n \n\n How so? States have a right to say the unborn can be murdered? That's what all you supposed pro-life state righters don't understand. If the Roe decision is overturned and states can once again legislate on matters of abortion, what guarantee do we have that the states will prohibit abortion? Popular sovereignty did not work for slavery and it won't work for abortion. \n Your the pragmatist, not me, remember? I told you that Roe v Wade should be overturned because it set a dangerous legal precedence, not because it allowed abortion on demand. That issue should be settled by the states.\n\n \n Tell me why abortion is a state matter and only a state matter.\n \n \n\n None whatsoever. Congress may re-write a law that the Court has struck down in hopes that the new version will not be struck down as well. But, the only sure way to overturn a Supreme Court decision is to amend the Constitution.\n Exactly! So you agree that an activist SCOTUS is a bad theng, then?\n\n \n No. The Constitution means whatever the Court says it means and this is how the Framers of the Constitution intended. \n \n \n\n Or it can do what the Court said it could do and enact a law saying the unborn have legal personhood and thus the 14th Amendment's right to life. Congress could then use its constitutional power to regulate the Court's appellate jurisdiction and say the law cannot be overturned except by a unanimous decision of the Court, which is not likely to come.\n I don't ever see a nuclear option like that happening.\n\n \n Oh? It would be perfectly constitutional and I thought you wanted the Constitution to be followed?\n \n \n\n But, how do you know that the Constitution means what you you say it means? \n Between the Federalist papers, Anti-Federalist papers and other documents of the era, we have a pretty good idea of what it meant when written.\n\n \n Actually we don't.\n \n The issue of the Constitution's original intent is as old as the document itself, and determining original intent has always been a most difficult task.\n \n Some modern day politicians and pundits believe they can find original intent in the in the writings of the Framers of the Constitution. But, how do we do this when the Framers left so little in the way of writings? And what do we do when Framers were not all of one mind?\n \n What about Edmund Randolph, who proposed the Virginia Plan at the Convention, then refused to sign the document because he though the central government would have too much power and then ended up supporting ratification before serving in Washington's cabinet? What was Randolph's original intent?\n \n What about Alexander Hamilton? He spoke only briefly at the Convention and then went home because New York's other two delegates always outvoted him. But Hamilton then returned to the Convention after those other delegates had left the Convention themselves. Hamilton played only a little role in writing the Constitution, but he had a major influence on how the Constitution was implemented.\n \n And what about James Madison? Both Hamilton and Madison were authors of the Federalist Papers, but once the government was set up they joined opposing political factions- Hamilton a Federalist in favor of a strong government, Madison an Antifederalist in favor of a limited government.\n \n And then there's George Washington who refused to exercise any presidential leadership (while also usurping the power of the federal courts) by refusing to veto any legislation he did not personally think was unconstitutional no matter how much he personally disagreed with the legislation.\n \n So by and large original intent is a mirage since we have no concrete record of what original intent was.\n \n The only real record of original intent is found in the Constitutional Convention's Journal and the notes James Madison took on the debates. But, the Journal was not published until 1818 and Madison's notes were not published until 1840. That means the nation did not know what the Framers really wanted the Constitution to mean for the first 50 years of the document's existence.\n \n The Constitution itself is little help. The Framers left the Constitution intentionally vague in many places. For example, what does a term of \"good behavior\" mean? Does it mean a federal judge has lifetime tenure as long as he does not violate statutory law? Or does it mean, as many libertarians and a few right-wing types believe, that the judge can serve as long as he does not issue a ruling that certain segments of the population object to?\n \n Also, what is cruel and unusual punishment? Why was hanging acceptable at one time, but not now?\n \n And how can the Constitution say no religious test for federal office is allowed, but then say the Constitution was \"done in convention by the Unanimous Consent of the States present the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven...\" Just who is the Lord that the Constitution acknowledges?",

Rather than seeing unbalanced government budgets as wrong, Keynes advocated what has been called counter-cyclical fiscal policies, that is policies which acted against the tide of the business cycle: deficit spending when a nation's economy suffers from recession or when recovery is long-delayed and unemployment is persistently high-and the suppression of inflation in boom times by either increasing taxes or cutting back on government outlays. He argued that governments should solve short-term problems rather than waiting for market forces to do it, because \"in the long run, we are all dead.\"\n \n \n Which is advocating smoothing out economic cycles, making booms lower and bust shallower",

The only fair comparison to make is to compare HS graduates in the military vs the general population.\n \n \n\n Debunking the myth of the underprivileged soldier\n by Tim Kane and James Carafano\n November 29, 2005 | \n .......\n According to a comprehensive study of all enlistees for the years 1998-99 and 2003 that The Heritage Foundation just released, the typical recruit in the all-volunteer force is wealthier, more educated and more rural than the average 18- to 24-year-old citizen is. Indeed, for every two recruits coming from the poorest neighborhoods, there are three recruits coming from the richest neighborhoods.\n \n Yes, rural areas and the South produced more soldiers than their percentage of the population would suggest in 2003. Indeed, four rural states - Montana, Alaska, Wyoming and Maine - rank 1-2-3-4 in proportion of their 18-24 populations enlisted in the military. But this isn't news.\n \n Enlistees have always come from rural areas. Yet a new study, reported in The Washington Post earlier this month, suggests that higher enlistment rates in rural counties are new, implying a poorer military. They err by drawing conclusions from a non-random sample of a few counties, a statistically cloaked anecdote. The only accurate way to assess military demographics is to consider all recruits.\n \n If, for example, we consider the education of every recruit, 98% joined with high-school diplomas or better. By comparison, 75% of the general population meets that standard. Among all three-digit ZIP code areas in the USA in 2003 (one can study larger areas by isolating just the first three digits of ZIP codes), not one had a higher graduation rate among civilians than among its recruits.\n \n In fact, since the 9/11 attacks, more volunteers have emerged from the middle and upper classes and fewer from the lowest-income groups. In 1999, both the highest fifth of the nation in income and the lowest fifth were slightly underrepresented among military volunteers. Since 2001, enlistments have increased in the top two-fifths of income levels but have decreased among the lowest fifth.\n \n Allegations that recruiters are disproportionately targeting blacks also don't hold water. First, whites make up 77.4% of the nation's population and 75.8% of its military volunteers, according to our analysis of Department of Defense data.\n \n Second, we explored the 100 three-digit ZIP code areas with the highest concentration of blacks, which range from 24.1% black up to 68.6%. These areas, which account for 14.6% of the adult population, produced 16.6% of recruits in 1999 and only 14.1% in 2003.\n http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed112905a.cfm?RenderforPrint=1\n \n\n \n \n\n Myth 2: The military tends to attract people with lower aptitudes.\n \n Recruits actually have much higher average aptitudes than the general youth population, Carr said. In fiscal 2005, 67 percent of recruits scored above the 60th percentile on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery. The test is designed so that the average young person will score 50 percent, he explained.\n \n But high achievement on the test isn't new, Carr said. Sixty percent of new enlistees have scored at or above the 50 percentile -- the military's benchmark for recruits -- every year since 1985.\n http://www.militaryconnections.com/news_story.cfm?textnewsid=1767\n \n",

   "Prove it. Wasn't the B1 used in Iraq, both times?\n\n \n \n\n - The B-1 bombers --$27 billion worth -- aren't in the Gulf at all even though they were first put in service in 1986. The entire fleet of these planes was grounded for an entire month recently because of a series of problems such as engine failure, including an explosion that caused an engine to drop off a plane during a training flight. The B-1, revived by Ronald Reagan with nationalistic fervor after the project had been scrapped by Jimmy Carter, was designed to carry nuclear bombs. So far it has been certified to carry only one type of conventional bomb. Meanwhile, as $27 billion of weaponry sits idle, the Air Force carries out its bombing missions with B-52s, first commissioned in the 1950s.\n http://prorev.com/iraqwarone.htm\n \n\n \n \n\n Unproven in War, B-2 May Miss Iraq\n By John Mintz\n Washington Post Staff Writer\n Wednesday, February 18, 1998; Page A01\n .....\n But the B-2 continues to inspire more skepticism than awe among other Pentagon officials. Military planners are highly risk-averse, and vastly prefer to choose for dangerous missions aircraft that have been proven in war, military officials said. Nine years after its inaugural flight, the B-2 has never flown in combat. There are also some minor lingering questions about the reliability of stealth characteristics of the B-2's most recently upgraded version. Two years ago questions were raised when the B-2's radar-absorbing skin peeled back in the rain, but officials say that problem has been fixed in the new model. In any case, the B-1 bomber also has never flown in combat, and it is planned for deployment in the gulf.\n \n\n \n \n\n ...\n Virtually since it was born, the B-1 has had a history of design flaws, equipment failures and crashes. First approved by President Richard M. Nixon in 1970, the B-1 was designed to penetrate Soviet air space by flying great distances at speeds of more than 800 miles per hour while jamming enemy radar and closely hugging the ground.\n \n President Jimmy Carter killed the project in 1977, but President Ronald Reagan revived it four years later. In 1985, the first operational B-1, now officially known as the B-1B Lancer, was delivered to Dyess Air Force Base, but the event was marred when bolts from the plane's air-conditioning system broke loose and damaged two of its four engines. Over the next three years, three of the $200 million bombers crashed.\n \n With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the B-1's mission as a nuclear bomber came into greater question, prompting President George Bush to order the planes refitted - at a cost of $3 billion - to carry conventional weapons like cluster bombs and heat-seeking missiles.\n \n Still, critics inside and outside of the Pentagon say the bomber remains too costly to operate and too unreliable to be worth saving. \"Who would want this bomber?\" asked Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group.\n \n \"The problem,\" she added, \"is every inefficiency has a patron.\"\n http://www.nukewatch.org/media/more_media/08-00-01/mmb1bphtk.html\n \n\n \n Anything else you'd like me to prove for you? emoticon_rolleyes",

The B1 Bomber's offensive avionics system includes high-resolution synthetic aperture radar, capable of tracking, targeting and engaging moving vehicles as well as self-targeting and terrain-following modes. In addition, an extremely accurate Global Positioning System- aided Inertial Navigation System enable aircrews to autonomously navigate globally, without the aid of ground-based navigation aids as well as engage targets with a high level of precision. The recent addition of Combat Track II radios permit an interim secure beyond line of sight data link capability until LINK-16 is integrated on the aircraft. In a time sensitive targeting environment, the aircrew can receive targeting data from the Combined Air Operations Center over CT II, then update mission data in the offensive avionics system to strike emerging targets rapidly and efficiently. This capability was effectively demonstrated during operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.\"\n \n \"B1 Bomber capabilities are being enhanced through the Conventional Mission Upgrade Program. This program has already improved lethality by adding the ability to carry up to 30 cluster munitions (CBU-87, -89, -97), a Global Positioning System receiver, an improved weapons interface that allows the carriage of guided weapons (GBU-31, Joint Direct Attack Munitions) and advanced secure radios (ARC-210, KY-100).

I make hawks look like doves.......but let's get down to the facts. \n \n There were only 4 B-1A's built in the 70's. One crashed, one was scrapped and the other two are museum pieces. \n The reincarnate, the B-1B, was designed specifically to be a supersonic long range delivery system for nuclear weapons. SAC used them from 1986 - 1992 ONLY. (Compare that to the B-52 which has been in service for, what, 5 decades?) It was half as fast as its predecessor, with a 1.2Mach maximum speed as opposed to the B-1A's 2.5Mach max. It was only after the fall of the Soviet Union that the military had to come up with an alternate role for the albatros because it was too damned expensive to abandon at that point.\n \n The B-1B WAS used AFTER all of the Iraqi air defenses had been eliminated. At $283Million apiece, we couldn't afford to fly them into hostile skies. emoticon_wow \n \n Here's what Global Security says about it:\n \n\n Many of the risks and problems encountered in this procurement trace their roots back to initial decisions made by high levels in the administration and Congress in political negotiations to allow the building of the aircraft. Three constraints were imposed: initial operational capability by 1987, a budget ceiling of $20.5 billion, and the government to act as an integrator of the four major contractors. These conditions were not conducive to the development of the very technically advanced craft. The result was that the bomber had not lived up to the full potential originally envisioned.\n http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/b-1.htm\n \n\n \n Don't mistake my feelings about the usefulness of the B-1B and my feelings about our military. Like the B-2, the B-1B is an expensive, limited role toy. Give me $283Million (the cost of 1 B-1B) worth of F-16 and F18's and I'll shoot down every B-1B and B2 ever made. emoticon_xkill\n \n peacekic. LOL.....",
