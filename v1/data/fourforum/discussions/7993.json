People who self harm, and I know a fair few, generally are suffering from a mental illness, usually some form of depression. Insanity is not the same thing.\n\n The question is flawed to begin with. The only place \"insane\" is used in a professional setting is in the courts. It is not used by mental health professionals at all. In the courts it only means the person is unable to tell the difference between right and wrong at the time they were commiting the crime.\n \n But Jo's on the right track here. Self mutilation is usually the result of some kind of trauma.\n \n What inspired this question by the way Ice Princess?",

   "Well, I would put it this way, do you choose to cut, do you experience a desire to cut and then make a conscious decision to do so, or do you suddenly find yourself cutting, as if you were dreaming or not paying attention to it.\n \n If the former, I would suggest a cognitive solution, meaning think about how you have felt when you have been motivated to cut (eg. bored? stressed? depressed? like you have no control?), what you believe will be the consequences of cutting (eg. relief of boredom, physical stimulation, \"high\", relieved, alive), how you feel after you have cut. (???) and compare the two. Do your beliefs about the results of cutting match the reality of cutting experience? If not, what are some alternatives that will allow you to achieve the results you desire? (eg music, sports, reading).\n \n If you find that it is not a conscious choice, but an unconscious habit (like a smoker lighting up before they have even realised they have done so), this is something that can only be altered through practice - try to catch yourself before you do it, avoid \"triggers\" that could cause it.",

They have no respect for you or your life if they don't care what they are making you do. :) Not to sound rude.\n\n Seems like you are jumping to some pretty hefty conclusions here. She said she was confused, not that someone was telling her to cut herself. The problem is usually not this simple. \n \n A desire to harm ones self usually comes from that individuals inability to cope with life's stressors, whether they be from family, friends, academic pressure, religious concerns, sexual identity, etc. Usually, there is no significant difference in the amount of stressors or pressure between an individual who self harms, and one who does not. It is the individuals ability to deal with these stressors that makes all the difference. \n \n Case in point:\n In my job as a paramedic, myself and my co-workers are subjected to significant physical and emotional stressors on a daily basis. I have been hit, spit on, shot at, made to feel as if I \"let someone die\", sued, looked down upon, etc. Not to mention, that I and many of my co-workers place enormous pressure on ourselves to do our jobs without fault or error. Unless you have been there, it is hard to understand what it does to you when you question yourself for weeks after a 4 y/o kid dies in the back of your ambulance...\"did I do everything I could have? Was there something else I could have done\"? \n \n Our ways of dealing with this pressure are many. Many play golf, some read, some hike, some lift weights, some play guitar, some sign in church choirs. Some drink, many smoke, some drink far too much, some abuse drugs, some beat their wives, some put bullets through their heads. Thankfully there are many more of the golfers and hikers than the drug addicts and suicides, but it does happen. So we ask ourselves why. The answer almost always comes down to the fact that the individual was unable to effectively cope with the stressors in their life, and had not developed a safe or healthy mechanism to relieve the stress. They instead choose a self destructive path which can lead to further stressors and a downward spiral. \n \n To the original poster:\n While I do not think that you need to be locked up in a rubber room and heavily sedated with drugs, you do need to seek help. It can be as simple as talking to a trusted friend, teacher, family member, etc. A school counselor could be a wonderful resource in this case, or even a therapist who understands this type of situation. Even an old street psychologist like myself might be able to provide you with some insights. The important part is to go to someone YOU are comfortable with, someone who understands your problem, and someone who can listen as well as give advise. If you are not comfortable talking to someone, chances are you will not be comfortable with what they have to say to you. My \"PM\" door is always open if you need it, as are many around here I presume.",

   "Ice Princess,\n \n \"Cutting\" and Self Injurious Behavior (not everyone cuts, or primarily cuts) indicates different states of mind in different people. For a lot of people who \"cut\", what they produce is nothing more than what psychologist call \"superficial\" cuts that barely scar and produce relatively little blood/chance of infection. This would account for the majority of \"cutters\" that the general public envisions when the term \"cutter\" is used. Then there are very ypung children who are self abusive due to extreme abuse or developmental disorders and can end up causing quite a lot of permanent harm to themselves. There are also those that are out of touch with reality (what you would probably call \"insane\") and who cut, burn or mutilate themselves in ways that constitute medical emergencies (ie: cutting off body parts or ennucleation, etc). Many of these individuals are schizophrenic.\n \n The fact that you recognize your behavior is aberrent and are looking for answers is a good thing. The \"insane\" generally do not generally recognize as much.\n \n For the record I began harming myself in the crib. I don't use the word \"cutting\" because that option wasn't available to me until quite a bit older. As an infant I would smash my head against the crib bars until my head was bruised and pummel my face. As I got older (walking, etc) I would often attempt to drink cleaners, etc. I was extremely self abusive. I didn't give up self injur until the age of 22 or so, and by that time I had come very close to losing a body part more than once (my arm, due to the depth of the wound... to call it a \"cut\" would be misleading, for it extended down and into the bone and was at risk of osteomyletis... it was more a failed amputation).... I realized about this time, in between periods of black outs and incredible depression, that whatever was fueling this self hatred was going to have to be \"cauterized\", at least for a while, and I sought therapy (and to be sure, there are quite a feq quacks out there that call themselves counsellors- look around!)\n \n I am 24 now and still suffer with extreme depression and a sense of being rootless and old. It's a horrible sensation to live with. But as someone who engaged in some of (not the worst, but up there) most dangerous self injury that can be down short of suicide or amputation, I'd argue that \"cutting\" doesn't make one insane but that the depth and severity of it are the indicators or mental health. And anyone cutting, no matter how \"superficially\" is in deep pain. That is one thing I don't doubt in the slightest.\n \n For those at their lowest, who feel beyond help, remember.... today is the only day you have to live through. You'll deal with tomorrow when it comes.\n \n aaw",

A counselor can be very helpful. It can be a lonely and scary thing to go into your own head alone. A good counselor can be a great comfort in facing things that may be leading you to cut. Even a good friend who you can trust. Not someone you don't know necessarily but someone you have known for a while and who knows you and you can trust them to consider your best. And that does not mean someone who will just go along with whatever you do. You want to find a person who is willing to risk things with you to tell you the truth.\n \n I too know some resource if you want to PM me as well. I think M_S has given you sound advice.
