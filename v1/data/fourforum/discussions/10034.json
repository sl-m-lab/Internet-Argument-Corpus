   "NY Assembly Passes Marriage Equality Bill\n The New York State Assembly just voted to pass the marriage bill by a vote of 85 to 61. The vote comes a bit over a month after Gov. Spitzer introduced the bill into the Legislature and a bit under a year since the NYS Court of Appeals ruled that it's the Legislature's job to decide on the issue of same-sex marriage.\n It's not likely the GOP senate will pass it, of course, but who knows?
