   "American analysts have tried to assure EU authorities that Ukraine has one of Europe's fastest growing economies. They told our governments about quick stabilization of its internal situation after Yuschenko's coming to power there. And it seems to me European businessmen and investors turned out to be tangled in this adventure. They were simply allured into using so-called Ukraine's potential for their successful business. Everyone knows that Ukraine is well-educated, highly-skilled workforce. Its low labour costs provide an ideal environment for business to prosper. But that can truly happen only if it's supported by strong implementation of political and economic reforms. But in the opinion of representatives of foreign business (who started investing in Ukraine two years ago) reforms are slow there. And the main problem of business are not Ukrainian laws themselves, but their enforceability. In other words nothing has really changed there. The risks continue to be too high for many Western investors, who have come to Ukraine and commenced their business. They act practically by touch. So there is no surprise for me that British and German investors abandoned all hope on quick economic reforms in Ukraine. Their investment funds funk of internal government struggle there. That is why Americans did not hurry to invest Ukraine... So when will we, Europeans, develop the knack of living with our own mind?",
