   "Is there such thing as an acceptable racist joke? If so, how would you define it?\n \n My friends and I were discussing racist jokes over lunch. Some are harmless fun, merely poking at the stereotypes American society emphasizes. But some, we came to realize, are just plain mean and downright horrible. Take, for example:\n \n \nWhat do you do when you see a black person hopping on one foot? Stop laughing and reload.\n\n \n Acceptable or innapropriate?\n \n \nHow many jews can you fit in a car? Two in the front, three in the rear, and 20 in the ashtray.\n\n \n Acceptable or innapropriate?\n \n I would lable the above highly innapropriate. And then there are some I just don't get. Like this:\n \n \nA man was driving home through the country when he hit a bump. Unbeknowest to him, his bowling ball fell out of the back of his truck. The next day, when driving back, he sees black man dead on the road and a farmer with a pitchfork attacking his bowling ball.\n \"What are you doing,\" he asks.\n \"Well,\" the farmer replies, \"you got the n*****, but im trying to kill the egg before it hatches!\"\n\n \n Huh? Is that supposed to be funny? I just don't get it.\n \n So once again, is there such a thing as an appropriate harmless racist joke, and if so, how do you define it?",

Need Another Seven Astronauts\".\n \n Which had true longevity when it became \n \n \"What does NASA stand for? Not Another Seven Astronauts!\".\n \n Following the loss of Columbia in 2003.\n \n Is that tasteless humour, making fun of peoples deaths?\n\n In the case of jokes like this, they are the product of how different people deal w/loss. Some people are uncomfortable w/the morose aspect of death, so they make a joke of it. Does not make it for everyone, but does not mean the originator of said joke meant any real harm.\n \n IMO, the best philosophy to take for comedy is the Fart Principle. A fart may offend, but that was not its original intent. It was for the release of pressure.",

Back in the sixties I went to a lecture by Al Capp, who wrote the hillbilly cartoon strip L'il Abner. Someone in the audience asked what makes people laugh, and Capp gave an answer that I thought was pretty profound. In a nutshell, he replied that people laugh at someone else's pain or discomfort, that every joke has a butt, and the audience got very quiet as he spoke. \n \n Jokes, like cartoon caricatures, emphasize the characteristics which make a person different from the local norm, and minimize or ignore the characteristics which meet the local norm. Good satire can rise to a high art form, as with Swift's Gulliver's Travels or Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel or Cervantes' Don Quixote, but it can also degenerate to the level of public restroom graffiti, and cover the whole spectrum from tasteful to tasteless in between.\n \n The problem with Political Correctness is that it allows anyone to claim they are offended, and gives them the right to shut you up. That in itself is a stereotype that assumes any criticism, however light-hearted, is motivated by mean and base insensitivity on your part - but that stereotyping seems to escape the PC crowd.",

   "OK First of all some of racist jokes are just down right mean and not funny at all, but to use the term unacceptable implies a right to not be offended. From all the liberal opinions I read I sure sensed a lot of intolerance. If you want to use the words acceptable and unacceptable then I think the real question is if any person or group has the right to not be offended. The answer is NO. You can walk away, you can change the channel, or form an anti group of your own, however any attempt to silence another or (ban an offensive word) is unconstitutional. It would surely violate someone else's right to free speech, weather their opinion is right or wrong ignorant or not. Think about the implications of everyone having the right to not be offended and practice some of the tolerance and acceptance that you liberals preach.
