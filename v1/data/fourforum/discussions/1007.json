   " have seen news stories suggesting the PLO has very little power nowadays.\n \n \n Arafat controls 12 security forces. At the time Abbas was PM, Arafat only gave control over control of four of them.\n The PLO has huge favor among the people. 70-80% of Palestinians support Arafat.\n Also on September 11, 2003 when Sharons cabinent made remarks about expelling Arafat thousands of demonstrators went to rally in support of Arafat. \n Among the crowd you could see many masked men with rifles pointed in the air.\n Arafat also said on that day to the crowd:\n \"To Jerusalem we are going as martyrs in the millions\".\n \n \n \n \nAlso, isn't Hamas a separate organization. It was started more for humanitarian reasons.\n \n \n - In several interviews with news reporters the (masked) terrorists claimed strict loyalty to Arafat. They told the reporters that they did his bidding. (Or something to the effect of that).\n There are other terrorist orginizations such as Al Martyrs Birgade which is the right wing of Arafats Fatah movement. (Excuse poor spelling). \n There are other terrorist groups that act on their own though.\n \n \n \nI think if Arafat told them not to attack Israel there would be some that would still. \n \n \n If Arafat truly wanted peace I would expect no bombings from Hammas but rather from other orginizations of which are not loyal to Arafat but rather the principle of destroying Israel and killing the \"infidels\".\n \n \nHe does not have the power over his people as the President of the US or Israel has over their people.\n \n \n The past two PM have been handpicked by Arafat. He controls the orginization that has heavy support by the people and the offical government.\n I PM picked by Arafat is a sharade.\n \n \n The reason I suggest not expelling Arafat is because he has NO real power and if they do expel him he might take on power similar to a martyr\n \n \n - Arafat is considered by Palestinians to be their leader. He has substantial power. I'm actaully thinking killing Arafat seems a better choice. All he requires is a cellphone to operate his terror infrastructure (sp) from another country.\n \n \n \nexacerbate the problem.\n \n \n In removing Arafat (1 way or another) the Israelis should expect retaliation from terrorists and world criticism but the world will move on. \n \n Tell me what is the difference between a person such as Osama Bin Laden as oppose to Arafat? Why should Arafat be spared and Osama be killed?\n \n An end note:\n \n Actaully I was unaware of this but Arafat is president of the PA. (Palestinian Authority) Excluding the recently appointed PM's (by Arafat) the PA is the offical government. It governs the west bank and Gazaa strip.\n He is chairman for the Executive Committee of Palestine Liberation Organization.\n \n \n Always Stay Open Minded",
