   "Claims are being made that if we lose the war in Iraq, the blame will go to the Democrats, the media or certain members of the American public.\n \n The media get blamed because they dare to question official accounts and express independent opinions. What is being advocated? Apparently media that are simply an extension of the government, which, of course, is something we purport to abhor when we discuss totalitarian regimes.\n \n As to blaming the Democrats, who have no say in the executive branch and had virtually none in the legislative branch until nine months ago, how is that rational?\n \n As to the public, if Americans are questioning the war, it is because of the lack of true leadership and constantly being asked to be patient for the next mirage (wait for the constitution, the elections, the government or the police to form).\n \n While we are constantly being told how critical the Iraq war is, there has been no call for all Americans to sacrifice so that we can prevail. Instead, the physical and emotional burden of this fight falls to a few, while we pass the financial costs on to future generations.\n \n Make no mistake: If the Iraq cause is lost, it is squarely on the shoulders of this administration and the Republican Congress that enabled it. The administration is responsible for the beat of the pre-war drum and the (so far) disastrous aftermath. The Republican Congress is culpable because it abdicated its constitutional responsibilities to question and oversee.",

The democrats have voted for funds for the war because they'd otherwise be called anti-the-troops and thus loose elections.\n\n \n And that changes that the Democrats voted to authorize force how?\n \n The fact remains that numerous democrats all vote for authorize force. \n \n It doesn't matter that the Republicans are great at smear, they STILL VOTED YES. Therefore they are JUST as a fault. It wasn't like the Republicans put guns to their heads. \n \n And if the Democrats had any backbone, they would have argued against those claims (which are obviously false). The Democrats failed to provide a market place of ideas. They went along with the debacle. Therefore they are to blame as well. \n \n \nI do not support Hillary or her vote on the war, but I think she will be the nominee and if she is, I will work for her election.\n\n \n I meant Paul. And you did not answer if Hillary is responsible for the war.",
