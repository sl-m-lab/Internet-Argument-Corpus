   "Apathy Sam,\n I believe the verse to which you are referring is Exodus 21:22-25. But notice that it refers to the pregnant woman as a \"woman with child.\"\n \n Nowhere in the Bible is abortion specifically prohibited but the foundation of Christian argument from a biblical perspective is the fact that the unborn being is established as a person from the moment of creation. The unborn being is considered a child. Thus the commandment, \"Thou shalt not kill\" applies. Check out some of these verses as a start: Psalm 139:13-16, Psalm 71:6, Deutoronomy 30:19, Luke 1:15 and 1:41, Isaiah 49:1, Jeremiah1:5, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20  \n \n It is also of note that it was, in a sense, a curse to be barren in the Jewish/Christian community. Children were thought of as a blessing from God Psalm 127:3-5, Matthew 18:10 (there are many other indications of this as well). An attempt at abortion would go against the prevailing culture and mindset.\n \n The early Church also spoke out against abortion. Look at this link to see excerpts of the Church Fathers on the subject: http://www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp Keep in mind that not all Christian practices and beliefs are explicity spelled out in scripture.",

I was wondering if it was true, and if anyone could point to the Bible passages they use to justify ending (or approving of) abortion.\n \n Thanks much.\n\n \n The Orthodox Church follows Holy Tradition, and this is the Scripture as rightly understood.\n \n Part of Holy Tradition is the Bible, but also the teachings of the Holy Fathers... some of whom wrote before we put the Bible together.\n \n \"In the Orthodox Church calendar there are three occasions in which the Church commemorate three important persons in the womb. This happens in the celebration of The Annunciation, in the feast of the conception of the Theotokos (Mary), by Saint Anne, and the celebration of the conception of Saint John the Baptist by Saint Elizabeth Schaeffer, F, \"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion\", pp243-4\n \n The significance of Mary's visitation to her cousin, when the unborn St. John the Baptist leapt for joy means that we understand that personality, and life exist before birth.\n \n Isaiah 49.15 \"Can a woman forget her nursing child, and not have compassion on the son of her womb?\"\n \n \"In the light of Holy Tradition the wilful abortion of a bay by its mother is as unnatural a practice as can be imagined.\" (Ibid, p244)\n \n \n \"There are two ways of instruction, as there are two powers, that of light and that of darkness. And there is a great difference between the two ways. One is controlled by God's light-bearing angels, the other by the angels of Satan. And as the latter is the ruler of the present era of lawlessness, so the former is lauded from eternity to eternity. Among the precepts of the way of light is this; do not murder a child by abortion, or commit infanticide.\" From the Epistle of Barbanas (c.138) as quoted in Ibid, p235\n \n \"How, then is a living being conceived? Is the substance of both body and soul formed together at the same time, or does one of them precede the other? We do indeed maintain that both are conceived, formed and perfected at the same time, as they are born together; nor is there any moment intervening in their conception, which would give prior place to either. Consider the first events in the light of the last. If death is defined as nothing other than the separation of the body and soul, then life, the opposite of death, should be defined as nothing else but the union of body and soul... We acknowledge, therefore, that life begins with conception, because we content that the soul begins with conception.\" Quoted from Tertullian (208), in Ibid, p237.",

God's command is to love our neighbor. If you go around murdering people for whatever reason, you are obviously not showing this love. \n However, God did provide for people who unintentionally killed their neighbors. He provided cities of refuge for them (Deut 19) and no one could come and take vengeance on them.\n God realizes that at certain points in a person&#8217;s life they cannot be rehabilitated. When a person reaches this point of no return, God laid out laws to have them put to death. He also had the Israelites attack and completely destroy certain cities. The term used for this was often something that meant the irrevocable giving over to God. In other words, they were destroyed in such a way that God alone was left to deal with them because man could no longer handle the job. The Israelites did not understand this and often did not do the job God had commissioned them for. Then when the law did require them to stone someone or when God had them attack another nation, they did it out of malice and not love. It is based on these laws that Christians support the death penalty.\n Jesus did not abolish any of this, but He tried to show people that love should be the motivating factor behind everything someone does. None of the apostles (or Jesus) ever advocated putting another human to death for their sins. However, they did not allow those who openly sinned and saw nothing wrong with it to remain in the church. Since their ministry focused on building the church, and the church was focused on loving others, there was no need to deal with murders. They were to be dealt with by the governmental officials. Before Jesus, the Israelites were under God's government so He made the rules as to who was to be given the death penalty.\n I believe there are some individuals who cannot be rehabilitated. Since our judicial system does not keep these people behind bars for the rest of their life (mainly due to cost), I see nothing wrong with the death penalty. However, at this point in time I also think that some people are executed who are innocent. I wish there were better laws governing who receives it.",

   "\"Among the most highly regarded of ancient Christian writings is the Didache, which dates from the late first century. [8] Its teaching is unambiguous: \"Do not murder a child by abortion or kill a newborn infant.\" Id. at II, 2. This is echoed in another didactic writing universally esteemed in the ancient Church, the Epistle of Barnabas, from the early second century: \"Never do away with an unborn child or destroy it after its birth.\" Id. at XIX, 5.\n \n The writings of the Fathers of the Church and other authorities further attest to the unanimity with which abortion was condemned. Among the earliest was the philosopher and apologist Athenagoras of Athens, who wrote to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (c.177) to defend Christians against false charges of murder: \"What reason would we have to commit murder when we say that women who induce abortions are murderers, and will have to give account of it to God?\" [9] St. Basil the Great (c.330-379) was unequivocable: \"A woman who deliberately destroys a fetus is answerable for murder.\" [10] St. John Chrysostom (c.345-407) who in his famous homilies railed against men who secured the abortions of their illegitimate offspring, called their actions \"even worse than murder.\" Of such men who impelled women to have abortions, he said, \"You do not let a prostitute remain a prostitute, but make her a murderer as well.\" [11]\n \n Finally, Canon 91 of the Quinisext Ecumenical Council (691 A.D.), decreed that people \"who furnish drugs for the purpose of procuring abortion, and those who take fetus-killing poisons, they are made subject to the penalty prescribed for murderers.\" The same canonical position along with the opinions of individual Church Fathers, were compiled in the Photian Collection, which was adopted as the official ecclesiastical law book of the Orthodox Church in 883 A.D\"\n http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/abortion.htm",
