First it was torture is unacceptable. Now Isolation is torture, thereby making it unacceptable. What's next? Life without parole is torture? \n \n Isolation is a valuable tool that can be used to protect inmates and staff alike from inmates who are assaultive or otherwise predatory. Some people don't play well with others, in fact, that is why many of them are in prison in the first place. If not segregating these problem children, what do you suggest? \n \n I will concede that in some cases, it is used without justification, but there are many cases where it is completely justified. IMO, solitary should not be used as punishment for rules infractions like smoking in ones cell, or possession of contraband like pornography or tobacco, or any other rediculous infractions. It should be reserved for inmates who pose a serious safety risk to inmates and staff. \n \n Suppose you had the power to move these dangerous and violent predators back to general population. Suppose you walk into the office one morning and make the decision that there will be no more isolation. Now suppose one of those violent predators goes back to gen pop and kills another inmate or a guard. What would you culpability be on that?",

Judge Mark Ciavarella Jr., reportedly sent kids to the private detention centers when probation officers didn't think it was a good idea; he sent kids there when their crimes were nonviolent; he sent kids there when their crimes were insignificant. It was as though he was determined to keep those private prisons filled with children at all times. According to news stories, offenses as small as swiping a jar of nutmeg or throwing a piece of steak at an adult were enough to merit a trip to the hoosegow.\n \n Over the years Mr. Ciavarella racked up a truly awesome score: He sent kids to detention instead of other options at twice the state average, according to the New York Times. He tried a prodigious number of cases in which the accused child had no lawyer -- here, says the Times, the judge's numbers were fully 10 times the state average. And he did it fast, sometimes rendering a verdict \"in the neighborhood of a minute-and-a-half to three minutes,\" according to the judge tasked with reconsidering Mr. Ciavarella's work. ...... \"\n \n Thomas Frank Says &#39;Kids for Cash&#39; Incentivizes the Prison Industry - WSJ.com",

   "lefties are not criminals, so lefties don't end up in prison :p\n\n \n Not really...prisons are full of lefties just as well as righties and centrists.\n Crime (going against the law) can be appealing to a lot of people.\n I'm centristic...crime is very appealing to me. :p\n Daily I watch lefties break the law in the news...cause they don't like The MAN's rules.\n \n \ndo a stint in prison, spend some time in isolation ( a few months) and then come and tell us. :p\n\n \n I'd do AWESOME in it.\n Why?\n Because I really don't like other people. Much less uncouth criminals. I'd either have to plunge a shank into some gits eye or face upsetting bubba with some inane comment about his mamma that he wouldn't find as funny as everyone else did...and face having my face smashed in.\n Yep, in a natural setting, I can deal with not seeing anyone for long, long periods of time...I do so for work.\n And, with all that privacy, I'd not have anyone looking over my shoulder as I masturbated or ranted to myself.\n \n What you going to moan about next? \n Tell a BDSM masochist that being canned and locked in stocks is a wrong and vile thing to undergo?\n \n You're problem is in thinking everyone should be just like you and percieve reality and behave as you do.\n And that's just not realisitic. \n \n I'd personally have little problems living in your liberal, anarchistic world. But, before that happened, we'd have to slaughter ALL of those who opposed that way of life because they're 'tards who can't prevent themselves from projecting their personal power onto others.\n And, every few years, to maintain peace and stability, we'd have to purge the remaining group of people who had a change of heart or didn't take to the indoctrination pushed on them from infancy...because their rational minds saw through our little silly scam and they realized being a bully and despot caused them no ill problems but netted them massive personal gain.\n Yeah, they'd have to be killed for the greater good.\n Why?\n Because we just wouldn't have the resources to devote to imprisoning them or re-educating them.\n \n I think the remaining 233 of us humans left on earth by that time could hold hands, sing nonsensical lyrics as we scampered through the fields looking for fruits and berries (I'm certainly not going to farm...and be exploited by others*) as we're chased by our furry friends (Mr. pack of wild dogs).\n \n \n And Madoff can get to go to a nice prison because he had a more heavy tax burden that the poor slob who jacked a housewife in her SUV.\n Really, what do you expect? Someone to give and give and give and not get something in return. (LOL :p )\n \n \n What you really should do is give all this mush headed nonsense up. Go out there and get yours with some ruthless conviction and stop relying on others to 'play fair and care' because they don't and are incapable of EVER doing so.\n You're wasting a lot of emotional energy and personal time whinning about the injustices of the world. \n F'em.\n Seriously. You have more to worry about than if Jose Guiterrez Jefferson the 90 IQ thief who shot a 19 year old store clerk in the face after raping her is being treated well in a an over crowded prison. \n Society would probably run more smoothly if he was shown the security camera footage of him doing so in a 10 min. trial, asked for a rational explanation on why he did so, and then escorted out into the parking lot and had his head cracked open with a sledge hammer if his excuse wasn't really, REALLY good. A lot of money saved that could be used to deal with other issues.\n Meh? Too heartless?\n \n Oh, and jail was pretty cool. I got to lay about and read books and play board games and hear some really good stories and watch TV.\n I'd have little problems going back.\n And, knowing how prison works and how my mentality is, I plan on going there for retirement in my latter years.\n Think I'm going to massacre a lot of people for my ticket.\n Well, as many as I can get...\n emoticon_xbouncer\n \n And, if I don't like general population all that well, I'll stab some whinny git like you in the eye with a shank and go on vacation to isolation.\n Sometimes, I just need a little 'me time'.",

   "Hmmm. Non-violent offenders sentenced to minimum security institutions, yeah...how stupid. emoticon_rolleyes And they don't get to choose where they go, the FBOP does. It's a little thing called \"classification\". \n \n If you haven't noticed yet, this whole thread boils down to classification. Seperation of inmates into like groups according to the level of threat that they pose to themselves, the guards, and others. While it is amusing to imagine Madoff getting gang raped in a medium security prison shower by 15 convicted murderers, it's certainly not reality...nor should it be. Part of the reason that the US maintains one of the most humane prison systems in the world is that we seperate inmates according to crime and threat. \n \n And just so you know, the camps (Club Fed) are slowly disappearing in this country. Club Fed Allenwood no longer exists. Allenwood is now a Federal Corrections Complex with a minimum (low) security prison, a medium security prison, and a maximum security penitentiary. And yes, there is a large difference between a camp and a low security prison. I'm almost positive that anyone with a sentence longer than 10 years is not eligible to be placed in a federal camp, they must go to a higher security level. \n \n Kozlowski is in Mid-State Correctional Facility in New York, a medium security prison. The Regas boys reside at Butner Federal Correctional Complex in North Carolina in the low security prison. Rest easy Chet, they are where they belong, just as those violent problem children in isolation are where they belong.\n\n \n Stop it!\n You just stop it NOW!\n \n Using logic, reason and reality isn't what debates are about.\n \n You should know that by now.",
