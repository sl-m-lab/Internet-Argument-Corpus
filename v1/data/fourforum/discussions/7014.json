   "As you all know, the Russian Soviet Union fell in 1991. I remember that day. I am a Russian immigrant. I immigrated from Russia in 2001. I was born 1967. Beleive me, you Americans have no idea how much crueler that government was compared to what books tell you. I could tell you things they did to us that you never knew about.\n Anyway, onto my topic. As you know, President Vladmir Putin is gradually tkaing control of his government. He wants to make is a communist country again. Does he want to make the country soviet again? Can he? I really don't think so cause:\n 1. The old Soviet Republics (Ukraine, Yugoslavia, etc.) will not back the Soviet Union\n 2. I don't think the confederate Russian government will allow it. They would more than likely remove him.\n But I want to hear from you. I know that every day he is trying to. But, can he do it? How, and why do you think so? Please reply.",

The Russian black market was quite big during the 80's. All that happened afterward is that the Russian mob had access to thousands of now unemployed KGB agents.",

   "Guys, the Russian mob has been around since I was a little kid. I was once subject to the mob. I hope you never associate with a mob person. Back in the sixties and seventies, stealing kids and selling them, was a big thing. I was stolen and sold once. Then, in 1976, my illegal family said I was old enough to leave and support myself. I left, and tried to find my biological parents.\n Anyway, never underestimate the Russian Mafia. They are far better then any other mafia. \n -John Milosevic",
