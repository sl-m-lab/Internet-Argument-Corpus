   "U.S. guns arm Mexican drug cartels - Los Angeles Times\n\n \n And how exactly do you explain the article mentioning the hand grenades and rocket launchers? Are you saying that the average gun store has such items in stock?\n \n Trigger's link is much more accurate than yours is.\n \n Mexico Cartels Don't Buy Assault Weapons from U.S.\n \n \"The next day I went into work and sat down with a trusted senior Mexican manager. I looked at him and said, \"I thought guns were illegal in Mexico.\" He chuckled and said, \"So you stayed in town last night?\" As the conversation progressed, it became clear that guns are as common in Mexico as tamales at Christmas. Everyone he knows, including himself, own at least one gun. And, it matters not whether it's a semi-auto or fully automatic, they're all illegal, so why stop with semi-autos? Though clearly illegal in the states in most instances, a lot of Mexicans have more firepower in terms of military weapons than we can only dream of owning here.\"\n \n \"These are not the so-called \"assault weapons\" you can buy at the local gun shop in the U.S., but full select-fire military-issue rifles. Now, I know you want to know and are dying to ask; Did I see any U.S. military-issue weapons stolen from the U.S. military? Not a single one was marked with U.S. military markings. Everything was marked with additional foreign markings on the receiver, including M16 rifles, or they had nothing at all. I saw firearms manufactured in Europe, China, Russia and South America along with U.S. manufactured weapons. I saw rifles that looked familiar with no place of manufacture, no serial number or manufacturer's logo. The information was not removed, it was never there to begin with. I can only assume they came from illegal arms manufacturers in India or Pakistan that produce copies of weapons. It was obvious that none of these firearms came from a U.S. gun shop in Tucson or San Diego. You couldn't buy them from a gun shop in the states if you tried.\"\n \n \"Despite being able to own .22 caliber pistols or rifles, Mexican law requires them to be stored at an approved firing range. Where's the firing range I asked many times? No one knew of one. Where's the gun stores in town to buy legal guns? Gun stores? No one ever recalled seeing one anywhere in Mexico, let alone their city.\"\n \n \"All this flies in the face of news articles published by the U.S. media in the last week or two. Mexico's gun problems are a direct result of gun runners buying \"assault weapons\" in the U.S. and taking them into Mexico to arm drug cartels, says the U.S. media and government. That is a bunch of government and media nonsense. The cartels aren't arming themselves from U.S. gun stores with semi-auto AR15 and AK47 rifles. They've moved on up.\"\n \n \"Cartels buy their arms from countries around the world, most any place where military weapons can be purchased on the black market, or from countries wishing to destabilize North America. They arm themselves from a worldwide black market of full auto military weapons including grenades, land mines and RPGs. They also \"procure\" their weapons from the less than savory from within the Mexican military.\"\n \n \"The drug cartels can easily afford to fly their weaponry into Mexico using their own fleet of aircraft on to remote airfields, or land them on remote Mexican shores from their fleet of vessels. They do it with drugs all of the time. Drug cartels buying semi-auto AR15 or AK rifles from U.S. gun dealers is viewed as a joke by Mexico's drug cartel, most Mexicans, and unfortunately by the Mexican government. The only people fooled by all the political rhetoric are Americans listening to the likes of Attorney General Eric Holder and other anti-gun politicians.\"\n \n Latin American Herald Tribune - Mexico Arrests Cartel Hit Man in Execution of Army General\n \n \"In the operation, the Mexican army also seized 23 assault rifles, 20 handguns, 23 grenades, two grenade launchers, a rocket launcher, cartridges and ammunition clips, $42,000 worth of cash, six vehicles and radio equipment.\"\n \n Where the hell did the grenades and launchers come from?",

If you can, and your country has drastic gun control, your gun control just might have a chance. Otherwise, the Drug dealers, who are probably the the exact same people they call arms dealers, will just import them in with their already illegal drugs! Just like they are doing in Mexico, and everyplace else. And why not the drug dealers being the arms dealers we are talking about?

   "Mr. Smith, Sir. \n \n So let me recap what you and I agree on. Gangs are funded by drug money. Corruption of the Government, Police, Military, some border patrol, etc. is rampant, and done by the Drug Gangs. The government of Mexico did nothing for years about this problem, and it festered and got unbearable, but all of a sudden, now they want it stopped. The the violence along the boarder is about trying to root out these vicious Drug Gang predators. The Drug Gangs have weaponry that we here in the U.S. cannot get. A 60 minutes piece said the Automatic Weapons, the AK 47's and the FAL's etc. are coming from the Middle East and South America. And now, all of these problems exist because I have the Right to Keep and Bear Arms? Does that pass the smell test? Does that not sound a bit too convenient? \n \n But England and Australia are Island Nations and have some of the strictest gun control in the Western World, and you think the below is our fault too? \n   Weapons sell for just \u00a350 as suspects and victims grow ever younger \n Senior police officers have been warning for several months that a growing number of teenagers in big cities are becoming involved in gun crime. \n \n The age of victims and suspects has fallen over the past three years as the availability of firearms in some cities has risen. \n \n &#8220;Illegal firearms have become increasingly accessible to younger offenders who appear more likely to use these firearms recklessly,&#8221; a report on gun crime commissioned by the Home Office cautioned last year.\n\n \n   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture  \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research. A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n \n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n \n Here is another report produced by Australian Institute of Criminology here called   Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a article about is in the report here.\n Link  Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld' \nCANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. &#8230;. reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation,  they have failed to deter hard-core criminals. It also pointed to a large firearms black market. \n\n Drugs are all through the theme of these systemic problems and your theory is that it is because the I have the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, and you want me to become civilized. Sir, I hate to say this but, your theory sounds a bit too convenient to me too! \n \n It is time for the real people that are culpable to own up to their responsibilities, and do the hard work of making the people of their communities safe. That is what they get paid to do!",

Michael Dosunmu, 15, was in bed at home in Peckham when two gunmen burst into his room and sprayed him with bullets. He died of multiple gunshot wounds. Police said yesterday they have identified the weapon used as a Mac 10, a favourite of Yardie style gangsters, which can fire 1,200 rounds a minute.\n \n James Andre Smartt-Ford, 16, of New Malden, was shot in front of hundreds of people at an ice rink in Streatham. Days later Billy Cox, 15, was shot dead at his home in south-west London. Two men and three youths have been arrested over Michael Dosunmu's murder and released on bail. \n \n Did the title just say, \"favoured by Yardies\" or Gang members? Drug Gang Members at that! Imported guns! \n \n Australia. \n \n   The theft and sale of 10 rocket launchers \n There had been talk on the streets since early 2000 that criminals and motorcycle gangs had gained access to military arms and munitions, including rocket launchers,. ... His downfall came not through intelligence gathering by counter-terrorism police but from officers attached to Task Force Gain (since renamed the Middle Eastern Crime Squad) investigating a series of bloody tit-for-tat drug-related shootings and murders in Sydney's south-west. \n \n It is a tale of treachery and greed involving a member of the Rebels outlaw motorcycle gang turned protected witness with the code name Harrington, an illegal gun dealer and a former relative by marriage of Della-Vedova, whose alleged criminal connections were used to pass on the launchers.\n \n One of those involved, a drug dealer called Milad Sande, 29, was shot dead at Malabar in an unrelated heroin deal with an alleged member of the Bandidos bikie gang who has connections to the Victorian drug cartel allegedly controlled by Tony Mokbel. \n\n Stolen from the Military! \n   From the Australian FBI Trend in assault \nThe trend in assaults shows an average growth of 5% each year between 1995 and 2006.

Your country has done nothing to prevent these cartels from setting up and opperating unmolested from your soil. In essence your country have given them a safe haven to opperate from out of our reach. These cartels have come to the point of having the money and power to challenge your government for control of your nation. Your in action has caused our country to be poisioned by these cartels killing hundreds of thousands in the US and allowed criminal gangs to florish with in our borders not to mention all the illegal aliens who come here and tax our economy and resources all this as a direct result of your inaction.

Hmm I checked the map and there is only one border between Mexico and the USA, it is long but still just one. But look, I have never checked it on foot so you are probably right, there may will be several borders hence the amount of illegal immigrants.\n e) We are the mercy of the criminals because we have no right to bear arms and also at the mercy of the government because we lack a Bill of Rights. Torture, arbitrary arrests, deportations, exile, denial of passport, forced to watch endless cricket matches on TV, you name it. All of the above because we don't have a bill of rights\n \n Yes, you are so right. Damn! emoticon_xkill\n\n \n a. well if that's the way you feel about it then there is nothing I can do right? I think you are taking it the wrong way. You don't want firearms, fine. Don't get one, but don't try to force your beliefs on others. If you ask me the banning of firearms in Australia was nothing but a knee jerk reaction from the events that transpired. \n b. trust me they suck. I really wish they could get their act together.\n c. Of course. Steal some guns in the US and go back to Mexico with the merchandise. Since our borders are almost wide open, this is no problem. \n d. True, the Southern border with Mexico and Guatemala is wide open. Mexico doesn't seem to care for much enforcement with immigration. When they do catch illegal aliens from the Southern border they are treated worse than those captured by the US..and they have the nerve to ask us to be lenient.emoticon_rolleyes The problem lies with Mexico. They just do not enforce their laws. If they did none of this would happen.\n e. Well, you do leave yourself open to abuse. I'm just saying you know, one day it could be substantially useful. Really though, what one person thinks is civilized to another it is not. emoticon_frazzled",

   "A gunman walked down the aisle of a church during a service in the US state of Illinois and killed the pastor, then stabbed himself and two others as parishioners wrestled him to the ground, authorities said.\n \n The man walked into the sprawling brick First Baptist Church in Maryville shortly after 8am on Sunday and briefly spoke to Pastor Fred Winters before pulling out a .45-calibre handgun and shooting Mr Winters once, Illinois State Trooper Master Trooper Ralph Timmins said.\n \n The gun jammed before the man could fire again, Master Trooper Timmins said. The attacker then pulled out a knife and injured himself before churchgoers subdued him. Two parishioners involved in the struggle also suffered knife wounds, Master Trooper Timmins said.\n \n Gunman goes berserk during church service | smh.com.au\n \n A pulpit is a good platform to mount a machine gun. First you hold the high ground, from where one can see easily any potential attacker, second one can install the pulpit against the wall and armour it and put some kind of bullet proof screen. To me this common sense, or call it life insurance (kinda similar to a smoke alarm but incorporates a sprinkler system).\n Bottom line Pastor Winters had it coming.\n Now, the gunman probably bought the gun in Tijuana or Ciudad Juarez from those Mexican bandidos and of course it jammed since Mexicans are notorious for not maintaining their weapons. He paid the price of not buying in the USA from a reputable death merchant, I mean gun dealer. But on the other hand one hand gun is never enough. I have seen hundreds of Westerns and gunmen always had two guns at least (and usually a short barrel gun hidden in a boot) .\n We are way behind the USA when it comes to these kind of killings, damn!\n\n \n It always fascinates me how quick you are to change the subject when you're refuted.",

It is refreshing for American's to see the actual debate, and not one with hidden motives and agendas that is always going to change and actually move the goal post further, with each new infringement, on what our Founders said Shall Not Be Infringed! \n \n It is not only mainly some Democrats who are Anti-gun, but also some Republicans as well. However it was the Democratic Party who found out that the through surveys that American People did not want Congress to torpedo the Constitution's 2nd Amendment. The American People thought the Constitution, but especially the Bill of Rights, The People's Bill as it is called, should be treated with more respect. \n \n However, the same survey reveled that American's were concerned about Common safety. So they, as a party, said OK were are not for gun control. ~We, Are For Safety!~ However it was the same attack repackaged in the a different box. What the American People actually want congress to do is give us more cops, and better crime fighting practices and equipment. But for some reason, they Antis will just not let the failed idea go, and do the work the American people sent them there to do. Not that Republicans have done the job perfectly, either. \n \n However, that repackaged safety message didn't fly either, so they found out that the American People might buy, an Attack on Illegal Guns and crime. Now your talking! So they are now repackaging the same old tired attack on the Constitution under a More Stealthier, ~ We, are Not for Gun Control! ~ ~We, are against Illegal Guns!~ Which we all are, but the ONLY focus is on the Law-abiding, and absolutely none of the proposals deal with the criminals, who are actually the problem we want solved. That is what the American people desperately want. More cops, better crime fighting technique, and equipment!\n \n Maybe some day we will get through to our Congressional critters, but for now, we spend all of our time fighting each other over gun control, instead of doing the real work of We the people!
