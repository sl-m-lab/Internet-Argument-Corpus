   "I know there is plenty of debate about whether Christ was the \"Messiah\" or just a historical figure, but I just came across this interesting article which presents the argument that no such person ever existed at all.\n \n It presents as evidence the following-\n \n In 1800 BC, King Amunothph of the Nile was described in an engraving as having the exact story as the Gospels tell about Jesus, including the virgin birth, stable cradle, guiding star, massacre of the children, flight to Egypt, resurrection and bodily ascension to the clouds.\n \n This is beside the fact that so many cultures have similar god-child-born-of-virgin myths, including cultures in ancient Babylonia, Egypt, Greece, Rome and Palestine.\n \n Contemporaries who wrote from the areas that Jesus is supposed to have been in during the time he was supposedly actively preaching the Gospel and healing multitudes did not find him important enough to mention. For example, the great Jewish scholar Philo, who was in Jerusalem at the same time as Jesus was supposedly there, and in all his works he does not even once mention him, even as a \"false prophet\". He even discusses the names Jesus and Hosea, explaining their meanings. This would have been an excellent segue to mention the famous man calling himself a \"savior\" (as the name Jesus describes), you'd think he couldn't have helped mentioning this person if he were as active and popular as described in the Gospels.\n \n There is also the matter that the way Jesus is described by Paul is very different from the Jesus of the Gospels, which were written later. It would seem strange that someone spreading the word of Jesus wouldn't even mention any of the parables, miracles, the virgin birth or the sermon on the mount. Especially since the Gospels had yet to be written anywhere, so it is unclear as to how he could be spreading the word without that text, and without mentioning it in any of his letters.\n \n What do people think, expecially people who believe Christ was a historical figure?",

   "The earliest Hebrew texts point to a prophecy of messiah. I think they predate that specific king.\n \n \n Regardless, how does that explain that a king from 1800 years prior should have the exact same life story as the \"Jesus\" story? The only conclusion that makes any sense is that the story of Jesus was another one of many myths of the area about any number of people that someone was trying to make sound important. Not unlike the myth of Arthur and the water-nymph, King Amunothph had to have a divine right to rule, so a story was created.\n \n Also, if you read the prophets of the Old Testament, you will find that the references (albeit through translation) are very vague and contradict the Gospels. Many state that the Messiah will be either a reincarnation of Elijah, or more often King David, and not some new person. Of course, there is the argument about John the Baptist being Elijah, etc. But it also states that Jesus will be king, and rule the United tribes of Isreal, and many other things. Of course, to me the prophets read like someone's acid journals, so I guess it comes down to belief or disbelief.\n \n Frankly, most of the earlier biblical texts are all about how to be a good Jewish person in the desert. If the Bible is the \"word of God\", he's kind of all over the place, smiting people here for lighting incense when they shouldn't, but not in other more serious cases. There is no mention of a \"Messiah\" until the much later prophets, except for maybe that Moses is supposed to return. \n \n \nHe was an evidentiary professor at the time he started the book and outlined the statiscal probablity of all the prophecies be fulfilled in one person. It was astronomical as I recall.\n\n \n Well, the Gospels neatly claim that he did, but then they were written generations later, so how can that be shown to be proof.\n \n I'm sure there was an astronomic probability that someone could feed 4000 people with a few loaves of bread and a couple fish. The question is, do you believe it happened? Nothing so far I've seen is any evidence to a non-believer that Jesus existed at all.\n \n I'd still like to know how you explain the lack of mention by Jewish contemporaries. The Gospels make it sound like the guy was a walking rock concert, it seems he'd be hard to miss...\n \n Then there are inconsistencies like how one Gospel describes Jesus's flight to Egypt to escape King Herod, and the other names another person as King during the time of his birth, and describes his parents going about the regular 40-day baptismal ceremonies- which would have been impossible were they in Egypt.",

If people want to believe something, they will.\n \n It is not unfathomable, in fact it would make a lot of sense, for people to have amalgamated these legendary so-called Messiahs, and attributed incredible miracles to \"him\".

However, there is one logical issue with the forming of an amalgam from the various. The accounts, some biblical some extra biblical, of the apostles and various converts are that the majority of them actually new \"The\" Jesus during the time of His life and they, the vast majority of them, died some pretty horrific deaths. It seems unlikely that they would have done so for such an amalgam that they knew they were making. The letter's of the apostle Paul are very clearly not about an amalgam. Either he was speaking of the true Son of God or he was lying. There are references in other documents concerning his death. He was beheaded for this \"amalgamated\" belief. \n \n While you do give only one possibility and hint that there are other possibilities to the christian story, the one you choose does not logically make sense. \n \n It certainly makes one wonder would so many go to such horrific deaths just to perpetrate a hoax so that people would follow them?",

For example, the great Jewish scholar Philo, who was in Jerusalem at the same time as Jesus was supposedly there, and in all his works he does not even once mention him, even as a \"false prophet\". He even discusses the names Jesus and Hosea, explaining their meanings. This would have been an excellent segue to mention the famous man calling himself a \"savior\" (as the name Jesus describes), you'd think he couldn't have helped mentioning this person if he were as active and popular as described in the Gospels.\n \n There is also the matter that the way Jesus is described by Paul is very different from the Jesus of the Gospels, which were written later. It would seem strange that someone spreading the word of Jesus wouldn't even mention any of the parables, miracles, the virgin birth or the sermon on the mount. Especially since the Gospels had yet to be written anywhere, so it is unclear as to how he could be spreading the word without that text, and without mentioning it in any of his letters.\n \n What do people think, expecially people who believe Christ was a historical figure?\n\n \n \n Mizmaxx;\n Hi there;\n Yes many may of claimed of a virgin birth and so, but did any of them claim who was born of the virgin died for our sins later.\n If Christ was a lie to the world, it shure is the biggest lie ever.\n \n For the Christian faith is the biggest faith in the world and growing, next to them are the Muslim faith who also believed in Christ who was born of the virgin Mary but instead a Prophet ,not the son of Son who died for are sins on the cross, who was lifted to heaven before they killed Christ they believe.\n \n Here you have the two biggest world faiths,around 2.5 billion people and that not counting the one's who are hiding in other countries underground not to be killed or in their home's.\n \n Yes Christ is faith alone to believe, but there are many facts to look at, the Roman scrolls say they put a man on the cross who name was Jesus Christ, king of the Jews who not believers .\n \n Just think of it this way, with Christ so popular around the world for the past 2003 years the fastest growing faith, how could it not be true and also with so many other findings of truth and miracles in Christ name with no other name under heaven has done these things that happen every day we also do not hear of.\n \n Peace be with you; Drac",

(For instance, one claim that baptism was modeled after a Mithraic cult ceremony, but this ceremony involved slaughtering a bull and bathing in its blood and guts, much too different to infer borrowing here even if it was plausible that Jews would find something attractive about this.) I ran \"King Amunothph\" through the Internet and was not able to find any information about him except in some web pages claiming that Christianity copied from it. This seems awfully suspicious.\n \n \n \n\n Contemporaries who wrote from the areas that Jesus is supposed to have been in during the time he was supposedly actively preaching the Gospel and healing multitudes did not find him important enough to mention. \n \n\n \n First, we need to recognize there was no TV news network or modern communications systems that we have today. Also, Jesus was a poor peasant worker from an insignificant town who was executed as a common criminal. (Note there are doubtless many crucified people who lived at the time yet we don't know anything about their lives or even their names.) He reportedly healed some people (not \"multitudes\") and was perhaps an interesting local story via word-of-mouth, but he just wasn't news to the people of the time. Historians then were more concerned with military and political matters. Yes he claimed to be the Messiah, but so did a lot of other radical men. He did not take office, speak in the Roman Senate, write any treatises on philosophy, lead a violent revolt, or anything of the sort. Jesus is famous now, of course, but in the time and area in which he lived there just wasn't a reason for him to be so.\n \n \n \n\n For example, the great Jewish scholar Philo, who was in Jerusalem at the same time as Jesus was supposedly there, and in all his works he does not even once mention him, even as a \"false prophet\". \n \n\n \n Jesus of Nazareth was not much of a relevant topic in the kinds of things he wrote about even if the carpenter was more newsworthy. He mainly wrote on reconciling Judaism with Greek philosophy. Additionally, he died at around 40 C.E., he just didn't live long enough to see Christianity become much of an influence (unlike Josephus) and in fact never said anything about Christianity.\n \n It should be noted also that the existence of Jesus is no more disputed than Alexander the Great among professional scholars.\n \n \n \n\n There is also the matter that the way Jesus is described by Paul is very different from the Jesus of the Gospels\n \n\n \n In what way?",

   "There is really no debate no as to whether or not a man called Jesus ever existed on Earth. Of course He did! No one really argues with this point, the theologians and historians have proved this to be true. But the question that should be asked is since Jesus walked on this Earth sometime ago in the past, was He who He claimed that He was, i.e. of Divine nature, or the Son of God? This is a lot harder to prove/disprove.\n \n I honestly think that He was the Son of God. Honestly, why would or how could there be predictions made about how Jesus would be born and when he would die (for what purpose) several thousand years before Jesus' was even born? Also, why would anyone want to life up a person? It is in human nature to bring people down, if they are successful we often do whatever we can to bring them crashing down. Look at these sexual assault allegations that are constantly being made against sports stars (some may be true, while others may not be), for example. The fact that the Bible is consistant with its message (Creation, Fall, Catastrophe, Confusion at Babel, Christ, Restoration) from Genesis 1:1 through to the end of Revelation is, in my opinion, an element for Divine authorship of the Bible - especially since the Bible was written by over 40 authors over some 1,600 years.
