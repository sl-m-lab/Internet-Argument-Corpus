   "Jobs and wages\n France's unemployment rate is among the highest in Europe at close to 8.5 per cent. Though the situation has improved slightly in recent years, there is still a particularly worrying proportion of jobless among the young, the over-50s, immigrants and the poor.\n \n Jobs are voters' biggest concern, according to opinion polls. Nicolas Sarkozy, the centre-right candidate, has made employment the centrepiece of his campaign, pledging to bypass the 35-hour working week by scrapping charges on overtime to allow people to work more and earn more.\n \n Mr Sarkozy wants to replace the system of ultra-secure, full-time contracts and insecure, part-time contracts with a single contract giving more protection over time. He would give cut taxes for companies that increase wages and give tax relief for home services, such as nannies and cleaners.\n \n In this field, the ideas of centrist Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou are similar to Mr Sarkozy's, with the exception of his plan to stimulate job-creation by allowing all companies to hire two staff without social charges. \n \n The focus of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, the Socialist candidate, is more on boosting workers' \"spending power\" than job-creation. Her central idea is to increase the minimum wage by a fifth to \u00801,500. Unemployment benefits would also rise.\n \n Young people would be offered \"emplois tremplins\" - state-subsidised contracts with companies - to get them on the first rung of the job ladder. They would also get \u008010,000 interest-free loans to start businesses. Ms Royal expects the extra wealth to boost economic growth, thus creating jobs.\n \n Like Ms Royal, the far-left candidates would abolish a recent law making it easier for smaller companies to hire and fire staff. They would also, like the Socialist, push for the abolition of part-time contracts. Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, the anti-globalisation campaigner, would allow staff to block job cuts.\n \n Economy and taxes\n Much to the consternation of the outgoing government, France's economy crawled along with growth of only 2 per cent last year, allowing it to be overtaken by Germany and seeing it slump to second-from-bottom in the table of European economies.\n \n The trade deficit is at a record high, underlining the difficulties of entrepreneurs and exporters. Most notably, the national debt, running at more than \u00801,100bn and equivalent to \u008018,000 per person, has for the first time become an important issue in the presidential campaign.\n \n In response, the centrist Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has made a virtue out of austerity, promising to cut debt with a constitutional measure preventing the government from presenting a budget in deficit. \n \n Both Nicolas Sarkozy, the centre-right candidate, and S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, the Socialist, have promised to reduce France's debts, although the former gives more ambitious and detailed targets than the latter, who has been vague about how she would achieve it.\n \n On tax, the two leading candidates diverge strongly. Mr Sarkozy wants a 50 per cent ceiling on the amount of revenue a person can pay in tax, to scrap inheritance tax for everyone except the super-rich, and to exempt investments in small companies from the onerous wealth tax. \n \n Ms Royal wants to abolish most tax breaks of the last government, while leaving the overall tax burden stable. Companies off-shoring production or cutting jobs would be punished, but exporters would get tax breaks. She mulled taxing the French assets of tax exiles, but later backed away.\n \n All three leading candidates would boost research spending and aid for entrepreneurs. Ms Royal and Mr Bayrou both favour reserving a share of public contracts for small businesses. Mr Sarkozy plans to save money by only replacing half of the public sector workers who retire.\n \n Foreign policy and defence\n Since the French voted No in their referendum on Europe's constitutional treaty in 2005, the rest of the continent has been hoping that this year's election will be the moment when Paris emerges from a funk of introspection to re-engage on the international stage.\n \n The candidates of the mainstream parties - Nicolas Sarkozy on the right, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal on the left and Francois Bayrou in the centre - all campaigned for a Yes in the referendum. However, eight of the smaller party candidates - including far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen and anti-globalisation campaigner Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 - were in the No camp. \n \n Even the most pro-European candidates, like Mr Sarkozy and Ms Royal, have been making euro-sceptic noises, with both of them blaming the European Central Bank for many of France's economic ills, in a bid to win over some of the 56 per cent who voted against the referendum.\n \n Proposals for fixing Europe's constitutional crisis range from Mr Sarkozy's plan to put a stripped-down \"mini\" version of the existing treaty to a parliamentary vote, to Ms Royal's promise of another referendum on a new treaty with more emphasis on social protection. Mr Bayrou also wants a new referendum, but on a \"more transparent\" treaty.\n \n The two frontrunners also disagree on the question of whether Turkey should join the European Union. Mr Sarkozy, along with most of the other candidates, opposes the idea, saying it would dilute the political integration of the EU. In contrast, Ms Royal says that Turkey \"has a vocation to join Europe\" one day, providing it satisfies the membership criteria agreed by all EU members.\n \n Mr Sarkozy's socialist opponents have branded him \"an American neo-conservative with a French passport\" because of his economically liberal views and admiration for aspects of the US model. He has clashed with Ms Royal over defence policy, dismissing as \"demagogy\" her promise to ditch France's plans to build a second aircraft carrier and spend the savings on education. \n\n http://www.ft.com/cms/s/ce3ae8ba-e0f9-11db-bd73-000b5df10621,dwp_uuid=e17a8288-890f-11db-a876-0000779e2340.html\n \n For most of the non-French here it'll be Foreign policy and the Economy that are important.\n Sarkozy has been seen as more Anglophile than Royal, with some of the British press hinting she may be anti-British. Having said that her views on Turkey are more in line with Britain's than Sarkozy's are.\n I suspect Royal's policies would continue France's low employment rate if not exacerbate it. \n Their plans as regards the EU constitution ring alarm bells, with Sarkozy's being more dangerous in that they may subvert referendums elsewhere.\n I can't find any reference to their views on CAP ATM which is the usual French bug bear.\n \n In short I prefer Sarkozy on the economy and Royal on the EU.\n \n The Telegraph has an interview with one of Royal's MEPs who puts forward a disturbing proposition, (In anti-American tones but it's the \"Channel considered wider than the Atlantic\" and \"Ultra-Atlanticist\" comments that really make this feel untrustworthy)\n for the future of the EU. I can say with certainty that they would be rejected by the UK straight away but if the EU went down the 2 stream route anyway it would create more problems.\n http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/11/20/wsego20.xml",
