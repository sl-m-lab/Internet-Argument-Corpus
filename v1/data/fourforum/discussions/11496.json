   "Summary: The headline of a Washington Post article read: \"Obama Tax Plan Would Balloon Deficit, Analysis Finds.\" But while the headline focused on Sen. Barack Obama, the article itself reported that the Tax Policy Center found that Sen. John McCain's tax plan would add $5 trillion to the national debt while Obama's plan would add $3.4 trillion.\n\n \n http://mediamatters.org/items/200808110180\n \n What amuses me is this:\n \n \nMr. McCain's advisers have said the new tax cuts would be paid for by eliminating earmarks and making large spending cuts, but they have not identified specifics.\n\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/us/politics/27fiscal.html\n \n Really? Earmarks? Discretionary funding is minuscule compared to entitlement. Even if we got rid of all of earmarks that wouldn't even come close to balancing the budget.",
