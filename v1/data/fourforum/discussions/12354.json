My common every day deer rifle's effective range is about 1000 yards. Plenty far, and yet too far for me. Heck I can't even see that far any more. :) Plus, hitting something at that distance they are talking about would take a very, vary well trained and practices marksman. Wind and mirage is very tricky to overcome. \n \n I know one thing, they ain't talking about me! :)",

Even the article at the end states they have a range of 1100-1500 yards, so not even close to a mile.
