The only variable is whether that sexuality is repressed or not.\n \n Would you care to explain how being gay is equivalent to taking drugs or having unprotected sex? Gay people are perfectly capable of being sober and clear headed and using condoms, just like straight people.\n\n First of all, yes I do worry about heterosexual teachers, but since this is a gay thread that is what I'm addressing.\n \n Secondly, I never said that being gay is equvalent to taking drugs, or having unprotected sex. I said these are the things that we talk to our children about avoiding. Learn how to read and then comprehend what you read. \n \n Thirdly, sexuality can have an influence on younger people in a social setting. Young people are often confused about the changes their body is going through, and then you have outside influences that may affect them in a negative way. So you're wrong when you stated that it has no bearing on kids. Get your facts together. \n \n \nIt's the same Anita Bryant and John Briggs BS spun in the seventies with prop 6...

Later it will make less difference, as they get older they will need to learn how to deal with these conflicts.\n\n \n Now I can really agree with you on this aspect, because when you teach your children at home the standards you want them to live by, and then they go to school and have some teacher who is openly gay, making everything you told them not to do seem good, then you have to try and get these ideas out of your childs head, and it can be very confusing for them. \n \n \nI'm going to quote Harvey Milk here, since the quote fits my case perfectly. \n \n \"I was raised by heteosexual parents, taught by heterosexual teachers, lived in a fiercely heterosexual society, so why am I homosexual?\"\n \n Although technically it would be 'bisexual'.\n\n \n Maybe that is a question you need to ask yourself and not me, since I neither know you, nor care why you are mixed up.\n \n \nWhat you people ultimately fear is not that a gay teacher teaches or does his or her job. You simply fear out of ignorance that your kids will be \"indoctrinated\" or \"taught\" to be gay. THAT is the biggest hidden fear of ignorant parents today...\n\n \n Why do you feel that parents are ignorant just because they don't want their children getting involved in the gay life, nor do they want them exposed to it?! And since you are on the thread that I made I'm going to address you whether you like it or not. I'm not ignorant of the gay life, and that is why I want to take care that my nephews do not get involved in it.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nOnce again I point out that being Gay cannot be taught just as being strait cannot.. Can an environment be made in which a young person is comfortable with themselves to then come out? Certainly.\n\n \n I have been asking you to show proof of the fact that gay lifestyle cannot be taught, but you have not been able to provide any concrete proof. So stop stating things that you cannot prove. Also, teachers have no right to set up an environment that would cause children to lean towards the gay side. As you put it,\" come out\". That is not the right of the teachers, it is up to the child and their parents. \n \n \nBut I dare say that a teacher teaching a curriculum or even to go so far as to include tolerance of all peoples in their message influences a young persons sexuality..\n \n Such a claim is stooped in ignorance and stigma....\n\n \n Then I guess it will just have to be stooped in it then, because I couldn't care less what you thought. I know I'm not ignorant nor am I stigmatizing, it is in fact a bad influence on young people, along with the many other bad influences they have to face in school everyday. PERIOD.\n \n \nEvery school should be teaching tolerance, whether the teachers are gay or straight. Homophobia must be stopped. It's nothing to do with indoctrination, and everything to do with combatting intolerance and bullying.\n\n \n Combatting bullying is okay, but it is not ok for a teacher to teach children things that their parents have told them were wrong. If they want to live their life a certain way, then that is their business, but to try and push what they believe on the students, that is overstepping their boundries.\n \n \nIf its on the school curriculum ok but individual teachers should not be able to peddle their own take on how we should all behave.\n\n \n I do agree with this statement. It is no different then the so-called victims called homos. They whine about heterosexuals trying to impose our lifestyle on them, but then they try to impose it on our youth in schools?! I don't think so.\n \n \nOh and I suppose that a black teacher teaching tolerance on race should not be allowed. Or rather a Jewish teacher teaching tolerance against religious discrimination?\n \n Or even a handicapped teacher should not preach against intolerance of those with disabilities either? Point being is tolerance does not have a label. It is specific in certain areas but it is not just about one group of people. Period.\n \n Based upon your reasoning these things would extend to these teachers as well. But yet I am certain that you will set a case against gay people saying it is \"Special\" or within some other context to spin the subject into another light that paints gay teachers and tolerance against homophobia as a menace....\n \n Perhaps FRC will hire you to speak... This very thought was stricken down when Harvey Milk fought against such prejudice against Gay teachers with proposition 6...\n\n \n Let's take a look at this for a minute. \n \n 1. Black teachers teaching racial tolorence is totally different then teaching gay lifestyle. Like I had mentioned before. Black is a race, something that is genetic it is not just a skin color but a whole cultural background, that is a part of what makes a person who they are. It Encompasses different foods, and ways of life indicative of that certain group of people based on their family lineage, and history. For which tolerence should be taught in this instance.\n \n Gay lifestyle does not consist of these things. It is a lifestyle choice that would be being taught, and not something that will benefit the student. It would only lead them to adapting a lifestyle of constant ridicule and humiliation. Tolerence of race, helps to build a community and bridge the gaps between different cultures. Helping them to understand the background, and culture of other people. Gay lifestyle cannot hold a candle to that.\n \n Here is another thing, Race, Religion, and Disablities, are totally different form gay lifestyle. They have nothing to do with sexuality. Teaching gay lifestyle in schools or creating the environment for it is teaching a certain sexual pefference, and way of life. That is something that is personal and should be left up to the parents, to talk about with their children. Also, race, and religion are part of history and learning it has alot of benefits for a child. I see no benefit in them learning how to be gay.emoticon_rolleyes",

   "If a male teacher talkes about his husband around his students, its not going to be any sort of a leap for my 5th grader to figure out that his male teacher is having sex with a man. This, in my opinion, will cause a conflict because an authority figure is doing something I have taught my child is wrong, ergo one authority figure contradicting another.

   "I haven't posted much here. You people talk too much. However, there are a couple of things I must comment on now;\n \nYoung people are often confused about the changes their body is going through, and then you have outside influences that may affect them in a negative way. So you're wrong when you stated that it has no bearing on kids. Get your facts together. \n You get YOUR facts together. I have an openly gay brotherr, living with his partner for 34 years now and raising a daughter together. Neither she, nor any of my kids, nor any of the other cousins who have spent many, many days and weeks in that home, ever were confused about their sexuality. As it happens they're all heterosexual even though they've been way more immersed in the 'gay lifestyle' throughout their lives than an hour or so a day at school.\nwhen you teach your children at home the standards you want them to live by, and then they go to school and have some teacher who is openly gay, making everything you told them not to do seem good, then you have to try and get these ideas out of your childs head, and it can be very confusing for them. \n You shouldn't ever try to 'get ideas out' of a childs head. Ideas are good. You need only teach them to look at them critically and decide for themselves. This is true of ALL ideas about anything, not just homosexuality. Jeez!\n Also, teachers have no right to set up an environment that would cause children to lean towards the gay side. As you put it,\" come out\". That is not the right of the teachers, it is up to the child and their parents. \nIf by 'setting up an environment' you mean being who they are, yes, they actually do have that right. We're not talking about them standing up in class and saying, \"I'm gay and you should be too\" You can admire and like someone and still not want to BE them. In fact, that is the case most of the time.\n\n Tolerence of race, helps to build a community and bridge the gaps between different cultures. Helping them to understand the background, and culture of other people. Gay lifestyle cannot hold a candle to that.\nIt's exactly the SAME THING! EXACTLY\n \n You can no more teach a heterosexual child to be gay than you can teach a black child how to be white. You CAN teach them to understand the differences. Tolerance for anyone different than yourself \" helps to build a community and bridge the gaps between different cultures\" and is to be desired.",

   "Apparent to the parents, not the kids, maybe.\n\n \n So, your analogy was completely worthless to the topic at hand, great, thanks for wasting our time with that.\n \n \nBeing gay is more than a behavior, it's an identity. You would teach them that their very identity is \"wrong\".\n\n \n Would you teach a pedophile that his \"identity\" is wrong? Would you teach a kleptomaniac that his \"identity\" is wrong? How about a pathological liar? A pedophile has a sexual attraction to children, its part of his \"identity\", acting upon that identity is wrong. Again, its called self-control.\n \n \nYou'd teach them that their feelings are \"wrong\" if they don't match yours. Swell.\n\n \n I never said that. I teach them that acting upon some feelings is wrong. A person can be attracted to a blood relative, acting upon it is wrong.\n \n \nBut you condemn even in the absence of an answer. \n\n \n Have you even read my posts? Nowhere have I condemned attraction, desire, feelings or anything of the sort. What I have said is that sometimes acting upon those feelings, desires, etc. is wrong.\n \n \nWhat would you say to the teacher if your child is disrespectful and it comes out that your child doesn't feel the need since the teacher is gay and therefore \"wrong\"? \n\n \n Won't happen as my children have been taught to be respectful to their teachers. If you had read my posts you would have seen that this is part of the conflict I'm trying to avoid in my younger children. In my opinion it would be disrespectful for my child to tell a teacher he's wrong even though the child has been taught that what the teacher is advocating is wrong.",

   "Those are your values, they are whats acceptable to you. Feel free to teach those values to your children. But you have no right to tell other parents what values to teach their children and as a teacher you have no business tell kids the values taught by their parents are wrong. No more than a racist teacher has any business telling students racism is ok. \n I have taught my children that racism is wrong, any teacher that tells my child I'm wrong about that is going to have a problem parent on their hands. Samething goes for what I've taught my children about sex or stealing, or lieing, etc. \n\n \n Are there no things that you think are so important that all children should be taught them, whether their parents want it or not? And do you not think that some values are implicit in a school environment? Certainly in US public schools the idea of separation of church and state is fairly implicit. In principle we have just the opposite - all schools (with the exception of those explicitly of a non-Christian foundation) are required to have a daily act of collective worship which should be mainly Christian in character.\n \n I do want to clarify what we're discussing here. In most circumstances I would question statements from students rather than outright contradict them, which is usually enough with the more absurd instances. I have no intention of telling students they must agree with my views, but I will ask them challenging questions if I think their views go beyond the normal range of what is acceptable.\n \n In this country there is a limit on what is considered acceptable, and a wider spectrum that is considered legal. Advocating violence for political purposes is beyond acceptable, but just creeps inside legal so long as it isn't incitement. This means, for example, that teachers and police officers are expected not to be members of the BNP or Hizb ut Tahrir.\n \n \n \n\n Bad assumption on my part, my apologies. If I may ask, where is the \"here\" to which you refer?\n\n \n England (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have similar but distinct systems)",

   "I've been so busy latly that I couldn't come back and check on this topic. Now that I'm back, I see some stuff here that just makes me go,\"What the heck?!\" So I just have to go ahead and pin-point just a few.\n \n \nYeah, but you can hardly expect every gay parent, kid, teacher, kid with gay parents to keep their lives a big secret on the off chance that your kids might find out gay folk exist. Thats an unreasonabe expectation for anyone.\n \n Just tell your kids. My son had friends who had two dads when he was 18 months old, he handled it just fine. (Now his own adopted father is gay, but that is another story.)\n\n \n Ok, now this statement is something that I whole heartedly disagree with. Just because someone does not want a teacher talking to their children about being gay, does not mean that they create the illusion that there or no gay people that exsist in the whole wide world, because that would only be lying to them. We teach them and tell them about gay lifestyle and to aviod it. What we don't want is for a gay teacher telling them their take on gay life and advocating it, and making it seem as if it is no big deal. We don't want someone elses take on a topic that we would rather discuss with them ourselves, especially when the teacher is engaging in the same activity that we teach our children is wrong. Period...(BTW, I've noticed other people adding,\"PERIOD..\" at the end of their statements like I do. Stop copying me. You know who you are. I can be imitated but not duplicated, copying is tacky)\n \n Another thing. If a gay teacher cannot keep their private lives out of the classroom, then they need to stay out of the classroom. Because it has no place in there. So we are not saying keep it a big secret, but we are saying do it on your own time or you'll be left without a dime. Because I would personally make sure the teacher doing it gets fired.\n \n \nIf your teachings conflict with the actions of an authority figure, that doesn't automatically imply that the authority figure is in the wrong. As a crude analogy (and ignoring the ethnicity of current presidential authority figures): what if you were teaching racist values to your child, who then went to a school under a black headteacher?\n If you are worried that your child will experience conflict, don't send them to a school where they might meet a gay teacher. It's your call to make, although it's one I would disagree with. However, don't try to stop people teaching on the basis of their sexuality. As you said above, not everyone has your morals.\n\n \n What the heck is this statement?! It makes no sense. How would you know that there is a gay teacher in the school before admitting your child there?! OH! I get it!! You go up to the school and ask,\" Are there any gay teachers teaching in your school? Because if there are we are not going to send our children to school here.\" Dumb!! So we just don't send our children to school?! I don't think so. This is some that the school board needs to address, if they hire gay teachers it should be made clear that their sexual prefference, and lifstyle should be kept out of the classroom, and nothing should be indicated in the classroom about their lifestyle. Their actions,, dress, speech, and teaching skills better have a profession and moral reflection.\n \n \n \nI haven't posted much here. You people talk too much. However, there are a couple of things I must comment on now;\n\n \n First of all who cares?! emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nYou get YOUR facts together. I have an openly gay brotherr, living with his partner for 34 years now and raising a daughter together. Neither she, nor any of my kids, nor any of the other cousins who have spent many, many days and weeks in that home, ever were confused about their sexuality.\n\n \n Good for you, and this effects me how?! And your point is?! BTW I have my facts together, but where are yours?! Oh right down the toilet, because I don't see them. \n \n \nAs it happens they're all heterosexual even though they've been way more immersed in the 'gay lifestyle' throughout their lives than an hour or so a day at school. You shouldn't ever try to 'get ideas out' of a childs head. Ideas are good. You need only teach them to look at them critically and decide for themselves. This is true of ALL ideas about anything, not just homosexuality. Jeez!If by 'setting up an environment' you mean being who they are, yes, they actually do have that right. We're not talking about them standing up in class and saying, \"I'm gay and you should be too\" You can admire and like someone and still not want to BE them. In fact, that is the case most of the time.It's exactly the SAME THING! EXACTLY\n\n \n Blah,Blah, Blah...Gues what?! The first part of this bored me to tears. I'm not concerned about your sad we are the world, \"Immersed in the gay lifestyle\" story. Not to be mean but I really don't care.\n \n And as far as getting ideas out of a childs mind. That is why they have parents, and aunt's, grandparent's, etc..To GUIDE them. And that means weeding out any idea that is harmful. If you feel that ideas are good and never should we get any ideas out of a childs mind, then I guess if a child has the idea to try drugs, then we should just let him, and not try to get the idea that drugs are cool out of his mind because Ideas are good?! Chick you must be off your rocker.\n \n \nYou can no more teach a heterosexual child to be gay than you can teach a black child how to be white. You CAN teach them to understand the differences. Tolerance for anyone different than yourself \" helps to build a community and bridge the gaps between different cultures\" and is to be desired.\n\n \n You know, at the beggining of this post you said that you hardly post here because we talk too much. I think you should stick to your original idea, because if this is the best you can do, then your best left unheard. BTW-Why register into a debate forum, and then complain that we talk too much?! Maybe you should log into a thread that only shows pictures, maybe then you won't have to worry about people talking. Because,(let me let you in on a little secret) since we debate here, people are going to talk....ALOT!! WOW right?!emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n\n I never said that. I teach them that acting upon some feelings is wrong.\n\n \n I agree with this. Because you cannot help having certain feelings, but then when you act them out is when it is a serious offence against your inner self. Certain actions are wrong period. Just because wrong actions are condoned does not make them right by any means.\n \n \nYes lets compare feelings of pedophiles and incest breeder to committed gay couples... Once again the bridge of ignorance has been crossed..\n \n Sorry but your totally wrong on this. Pedo's don't \"love\" they lust. We've already gone over this in another thread multiple times before...\n\n \n Oh shut up! Here we go again! You say the same things all the time.\n \n \nIn your opinion, but, way to completely miss the point.\n A gay man has sexual attractions, feelings, towards men. A pedophile has attractions toward children. A person could have attractions toward a relative. The attraction or feeling isn't \"wrong\" per se, but acting upon them is wrong, in my opinion.\n\n \n And a gay man can choose to use self control. But decide not to and then tries to make everyone agree with the choice just because they have not chosen to control those feelings. Because they take their feelings and act on them.\n \n \nI don't accuse you of being wrong I just see you as refusing or not being able to see things from another perspective due to your morals or opinions.\n\n \n Why should he compromise his morals and agree with you?! And why infringe on his morals, and opinions while holding fast to your own so-called morals and opinions?! I say a double standard is being seen here from your comments, and you better think again if you think your morals are up to par with normal standards and morals.emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Ok, now this statement is something that I whole heartedly disagree with. Just because someone does not want a teacher talking to their children about being gay, does not mean that they create the illusion that there or no gay people that exsist in the whole wide world, because that would only be lying to them. \n \n We teach them and tell them about gay lifestyle and to aviod it. What we don't want is for a gay teacher telling them their take on gay life and advocating it, and making it seem as if it is no big deal. We don't want someone elses take on a topic that we would rather discuss with them ourselves, especially when the teacher is engaging in the same activity that we teach our children is wrong. \n\n \n And what if the teacher is asked about his/her family? Or the kid with two dads? Its ludicrous for you to expect that they never speak of their families or LIE about them. Its hardly their responsibility to back up your home morality lessons.\n \n Kids may as well learn now that the whole world will not always agree with them.\n \n \nAnother thing. If a gay teacher cannot keep their private lives out of the classroom, then they need to stay out of the classroom. Because it has no place in there. So we are not saying keep it a big secret, but we are saying do it on your own time or you'll be left without a dime. Because I would personally make sure the teacher doing it gets fired.\n\n \n Unless they were not teaching the classroom material, being overtly political or they were handing out the details of their sex lives you would be hard-pressed to do this - and would flat-out fail in states where sexual orientation is a protected class (like MINE yessirrr!).\n \n As a side note; its pretty sad that you would potentially deny your kid a good teacher if they may mention that they are gay.\n \n But that is the sadness of all prejudice. It isn't just about how you (try to) limit others, its how you limit yourself. I just can't imagine cutting myself off from wonderful people on the basis of sexual orientation any more than I can imagine doing so on the basis of race or religion. Way, way, way WAY WAY WAY WAY too many cool folks out there.\n \n Nazi Germany fired Einstein for being Jewish, and if he had not emigrated to the US, he would have likely been a victim of the holocaust.

Its hardly their responsibility to back up your home morality lessons.\n \n Kids may as well learn now that the whole world will not always agree with them.\n\n \n First of all, the kid with two dads would not be teaching a class. So that question holds no weight since I'm talking about TEACHERS. Ok, and second of all not many kids, ask nor care about a teacher's family. And if they do then they are a minority. The 12 years that I have been in school none of the students asked about the teacher's personal life, BUT I have seen and heard teachers volunteering information about their personal life to students. And as a student myself I found it very inappropriate. Especially when one of my teachers felt it necessary to tell the class when she was ovulating, and brought a calendar to school to show everyone when she felt she had to make love to her husband because she was trying to have a baby. Needless to say, I reported her to the principle. If a heterosexual teacher was in the wrong for divulging her personal life to students, how much more so would it be for GAY teachers?! \n \n No one is asking them to lie about their personal life, nor are we saying not to speak about it. But do it on your own time, and not in from of students. It IS unprofessional, and is not part of the curriculum. And like I said before, I'm not about to lie to my nephews about there being gay people out there(if you would have read what I said carefully you would have seen and known this, but dare I reiterate?) and it is obvious that they may not agree with their morals so they are perfectly clear on that subject. And another thing, I never said that they had to back up my home morality lessons, but they damned well better not go against them either. Because it is not up to a gay person to try to teach them differently then what they are already learning. \n \n Also, I think your statement about not having to back up my home lessons on morality. Then why should heterosexuals have to back up what moral lessons that people who live the gay lifestyle think they have?! It is not our responsibility to back up their home lessons either, but yet here you are saying in so many words we should. Seems to me like another double standard similar to the other ones I've seen here. And if children should learn that not everyone is going to agree with them, then the grown people who live the gay lifestyle should learn that lesson as well. Since they are always the ones whining when people don't agree with them.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n \nUnless they were not teaching the classroom material, being overtly political or they were handing out the details of their sex lives you would be hard-pressed to do this - and would flat-out fail in states where sexual orientation is a protected class (like MINE yessirrr!).\n\n \n Hard-pressed does not scare me. If a teacher was holding conversations about their personal life to one of my nephews then it would be a fight that I would have to indulge in, hard-pressed or not. I never run away from a fight. And since I'm probably not in your state, then it really does not concern me, so just be happy that your in the state your in.(yessirr!)emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nAs a side note; its pretty sad that you would potentially deny your kid a good teacher if they may mention that they are gay.\n\n \n A good teacher would not speak about personal things in a classroom, so if I'm going after one that does, chances are that is not a good teacher, so to me the situation would not be a sad one.\n \n \nBut that is the sadness of all prejudice. It isn't just about how you (try to) limit others, its how you limit yourself. I just can't imagine cutting myself off from wonderful people on the basis of sexual orientation any more than I can imagine doing so on the basis of race or religion.

If you had read my earlier post then you would have seen the part where I said that if they conduct themselves in a professional way then there would be no problem, but if they are running around flaunting their lifestyle like my nephews teacher, then that is totally inappropriate. And the fact that you say there are way too many cool people out there, shows that you don't mind finding them, so happy trails!!\n \n \nNazi Germany fired Einstein for being Jewish, and if he had not emigrated to the US, he would have likely been a victim of the holocaust.

Imagine that.\n I think you're trying to sidetrack this by pouncing on his 'vicar' comment--the point really is that a teacher needs to focus on educating rather than dispensing moral influence on what is clearly a controversial matter. Seriously--everyone knows the issue of gay relationships is a controversial one; there's simply no way a teacher can't weigh in on this or talk about it without knowing full well he or she is broaching on a controversial and moralistic issue. Unless they've been living under a rock all their lives. If anything, they should intentionally try to avoid broaching such issues.\n \n I can't help but wonder if the same people here who are arguing your side of this would be as eager to let a teacher do such if the teacher were a conservative and espousing conservative views.",

   "Sister, \n \n I don't insult children. My comments have nothing to do with your nephews. Children are brilliant. All of them. Whether they be white, black, brown, Christian, Jew, Muslim, silly, grouchy, on the honor roll or a struggling student. And, since I have come to the conclusion that I believe you are in the same age-range as my son, to an old broad like me, that includes you.\n \n The whooosh comment was me letting you know that you had missed my point. \n \n To sum up: I had stated that I thought it was unfortunate that you would potentially deny your nephews a good teacher should that teacher mention that he/she is gay. I went on to say that part of the trajedy of prejudice is what you deny yourself when you are prejudiced against a group. I then cited Einstein as an example. It was not what Einstein went through that I was highlighting. It was the fact that due to their prejudice Germany lost one of the most brillient minds of all time. Einstein being fired and leaving Germany wasn't a trajedy for Einstein, it was a trajedy for Germany. The analogy being made was between the hypothetical situation where you would deny your nephews a good teacher should that teacher be openly gay and Germany denying themselves one of the greatest minds in history because he was Jewish.\n \n PS - Regarding my son. Since I do believe you are his peer in age I am sure you call kids just like him \"stupid\" all the time. And sometimes he is. Kids.... emoticon_cool",
