The article says a 1 in 75 chance of a collision. If it were to hit the Earth rather than Mars, the damage would be less simply because we have a much more dense atmosphere, meaning far more of it would burn up before actual contact. Mars, if hit, would take greater damage. Might set back their planned invasion though, so here's hoping.\n \n Smiley",
