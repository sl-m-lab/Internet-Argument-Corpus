   "European culture has contributed greatly to the knowledge of the world in advances in the sciences, the arts and a wide variety of fields. This is attested to by the fact that the most developed countries are either founded on European culture or have adopted large parts of it.\n \n However, the relative success of European culture says very little about the worth of European blood lines and race. Peoples from Asia and throughout the world have shown that it is not the race which determines a person's success but the culture which he personally practices. A white child raised only with the same meger opportunities and illiterate uneducated survivalist culture as reside in war-torn third world countries will be very unlikely to be successful. A black child given an average upper-middle-class American upbringing has a fairly good chance of being succesful. It is culture and upbringing, not race, that make a people great.\n \n By the way, I do not claim that European culture is the only one with positive characteristics nor do I claim that European culture ONLY has positive characteristics since many ugly things were done by Europeans as well.",

These include Orkney and Shetland, and the Western Isles just off the coast of Scotland. These island Kingdoms did not join Scotland until 11-12 th Centuries.

That is \"throwing the baby out with the bathwater\". Gman's posts reflect some of this rejections of European culture.\n \n I personally think that all cultures need to be judged objectively and that people should adapt the best (as they see it) from all the cultures that they come in contact with and not feel obliged to stick rigidly to their own culture of origin. Cultural identity can be all well and good but to stick to a negative aspect of a culture out of a sense of loyalty would be foolish. For example, American culture could adapt more of the sense of community that exists in many other cultures. Often the traditional American sense of the primacy of the rugged individual can be taken too far and can blind people to the advantages of a worldview that promotes community responsibilities and benefits.\n \n I don't care if the races physically mix themselves out of individual existence.
