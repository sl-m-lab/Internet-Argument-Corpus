Or are you truly clueless because you depend on CNN for your news! There are, now, several investigations into McGreevy's fundraising activities. Including a Federal Probe of his #1 fundraiser, Charles Kushner. Who is now in \"plea negotiations\" with Federal Prosecutors. For the CNN viewers out there, that means Kushner is trading \"Dirt he has on NJ Democrats\" for less jail time. McGreevy(and the NJ Democrat Party) knows the Feds are \"nipping at his heels\". And he (they) figure it is better to resign now than have the Gov dragged off in handcuffs later.\n \n By the way, that CNN story doesn't even make sense.\n The governer of that New Jersey resigned because he had an affair with another man.\n Why would a Governor of a liberal northeast state have to resign because of homosexuality or an extramarital affair? \n These are things that get a Dem Pol MUCH more sympathetic and positive news coverage in the liberal northeast. Something to celebrate, not resign over.\n \n What Jim McGreevy said, in so many words, at his newsconference was\n that he was resigning because he was gay. And gay people can't be Governor. \n \n What a lowlife creep! To keep himself out of jail and \"save face\" for the NJ Democrat Party. He set back gay rights in this country 20 years! Until today I've never heard ANY elected politician, not Democrat, not Republican, not Liberal, not Conservative not ANY elected politician say that a person was unable to Govern BECAUSE he or she was GAY.",

A \"man\" who had no counter-intelligence experience, no investigative experience, no law enforcement experience! And it seems the previous Gov. had Louis Freeh lined up to take the job.(McSleezy rejected Freeh to keep the job open for his \"friend\") Maybe Freeh wasn't the best FBI Directer, but running the FBI for years makes him VERY qualified.\n \n These Democrats just can't be TRUSTED to protect the American people!",

He also tried to bribe him with millions of dollars.",
