I never asserted that 'being gay' is a behavior to begin with.\n \n \nWhen responding, do us all a favour and avoid using inappropriate extreme examples with regard to personal dislikes ;)\n\n \n To analogize an issue from the standpoint of moral disagreement, other morally disagreeable issues have to be used. I really don't think divorce is a particularly \"extreme\" example. If stealing is to you, then I apologize. My intention is not to use analogy to make gay relationship look bad, but to simply analogize it to show that it's an issue of moral disagreement for many people. \n \n \nI disagree. You seem to think that by labeling something a \"sin\" it somehow becomes okay to level that label against others without colouring the opinions of people in the process. It is still putting someone in the wrong by default\n\n \n It's true that a behavior ultimately is done by a person. Behaviors don't just happen with no human action. Otherwise it wouldn't be behavior. But the issue isn't the person. It's not the innateness of anything. Let me put a different way that perhaps will help you understand my viewpoint and the way I approach this whole issue. Even if a person isn't gay at all, it would still be immoral to be in a same-sex relationship. Likewise, a person who is gay but not involved in same-sex relationships (and therefore refusing to give into his or her desires) is not acting in any immoral way whatsoever. It's not being gay that's the issue; it's the morality of same-sex relationships. Now, you probably don't agree with me that having gay relationships is immoral and that's your prerogative. But it's also mine to believe that it is.\n \n \nand considering the power of religion over its followers you are creating intolerance and promoting a lack of sympathy towards such people.\n\n \n So as long as a person believes what I believe and never tells anyone about it, then it's ok in your view?\n \n \nIt is attitudes like this that continue to help sustain the undercurrent of homophobia that runs through society in the UK, US or any other country you care to name where such religious opinions exist. \n\n \n That's correct. It's important to stand for what we believe. If more people come to understand once again that gay sex is wrong, then that's great. But no one is going to make you do that--I certainly don't condone imposing any moral code on people.\n \n \nWould you care to consider the effect that religion would/can have by clearly stating being gay is as \"natural\" as being straight? It wouldn't win the battle but it would make a big difference. To make a comparison we can draw a parallel between religious condemnation of homosexuality and general homophobia in society and the failure to value child raising on the same level as jobs and discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace. Both of the former will contribute to the latter effects until such opinions are openly challenged and overturned.\n\n \n Well, of course there isn't 2000 years of belief plus numerous Biblical passages against child raising, so there's quite a difference. But to answer your question, I think the whole idea of sexual orientation is very overrated. All it really means is that people are oriented towards a given behavior. Most people in the world, by far, are attracted to people of the opposite sex. This idea that the small percentage that aren't is just as normal and natural is a stretch, I think. Sure, the APA caved to politics a few years back and now supports the idea. But that doesn't make it right.",

Many people think killing is ok, many think that it's ok as long as they are a certain race or religion. Morality is an opinion, an opinion of what's right and wrong. Most people connect morality with the golden rule. I wouldn't want to be killed, so I won't do it to others. In government it goes a bit further with the fact that \"if I leave it legal for me to murder others, they may murder me\". Which is why facists have no problem allowing murder of the people living in their country, because they have no fear of retaliation or being killed.\n \n In the US and many other countries, the same laws apply to everyone. That means that it would be foolish for one person to make it legal to murder people, because then they may be murdered. People made it legal to enslave blacks and made it semi-legal to murder them. That was because at that point blacks had no power and people didn't view them as people.\n \n Abortion is similar. Some think that fetuses aren't humans, while some think they are. This is opinion, which is morality.\n \n Gay marriage/sex/etc. is a matter of morality. But it's the person doing the actions whose morality matters.

In other words, trying to reduce them in status to a point where morality no longer needs to be applied to them. I can think of no culture that says that killing is fine, just cultures that say that killing is wrong, except for that one (or more) group. The biggest moral struggle that people have faced through the ages, and one we're still struggling with, is learning to apply morality to everyone. What often looks like differences in morality is very often just morality unevenly applied. If you look at how people treat those that they consider equals you'll find very consistent behavior. Killing, stealing, raping, in general harming another is bad. This doesn't vary, this is the basis that all morality is based on. I can think of no counter examples.

If you are going to say that morality is set, and there is some standard that everyone abides by, then (a.) somebody has to set that standard, and (b.) someone has to be the arbiter of what ideals get to be included in such canonical moral code. Of course religious people DO believe there is someone who does that: God. But I find it very odd that you seem to believe in such a morality absent of religious belief. It seems to me that such belief has to have the preclusion of someone or something that sets that moral code for everyone. And if that someone of something is not there, then it's not really a moral code. It's not really a set, concrete morality. It will be one that varies from person to person, not static.",

   "This isn't quite true. Few, if any, people think that killing is ok. They are, however, willing to make exceptions for certain races, religions, etc. If you look at the rhetoric that motivates those killings you will find that they almost inevitably involve de-humanizing the victim. In other words, trying to reduce them in status to a point where morality no longer needs to be applied to them. I can think of no culture that says that killing is fine, just cultures that say that killing is wrong, except for that one (or more) group. The biggest moral struggle that people have faced through the ages, and one we're still struggling with, is learning to apply morality to everyone. What often looks like differences in morality is very often just morality unevenly applied. If you look at how people treat those that they consider equals you'll find very consistent behavior. Killing, stealing, raping, in general harming another is bad. This doesn't vary, this is the basis that all morality is based on. I can think of no counter examples. What does vary, as I said, is what groups people are willing to apply their morality to.\n \n\n You seem to be talking about entire cultures, I'm talking about people. Many people currently kill, rape, and rob their equals. That's why we need laws. If everyone TRULY believed that killing was wrong why would we need laws outlawing murder? Many people believe stealing is fine if you don't get caught.\n \n \n \n \n\n Can you explain this, without simply saying opinion = morals? Whether or not something is human is a matter of fact and definition. It's debatable, certainly, but I see no way that morals apply.\n \n\n Yes. Morals are basically an individual's view of what is right and wrong. Obviously this varies from person to person. They are actually very similar to opinion. Just as religion is opinion of what happens when we die, meaning of life, etc. morals are opinions as to what is right or wrong. I hope you wouldn't say that religion is opinion.\n \n \n\n This is the fundemental problem I have with the morals = opinions definition. If morals are no different than opinions, then why even have the word? Why pretend that morals have anything to do with good and evil if anyone can do and say anything they like and call it morals?\n\n As I said before, morals are similar to religion. They are opinion of what is right and wrong, religion is opinion of why we're here and what happens when we die.\n \n And Morals DO have everything to do with good and evil. But good and evil are subjective words. Most people are not like in the movies. If you live a decent life, you help people. But you sometimes steal a few bucks from your friend. Are you good? Evil? This is subjective and that's what morals are. Maybe because their friend is rich it is within their morals to steal from them since they may not even notice a couple bucks. Maybe money is evil because it corrupts and they are saving them. This is subjective as you can see. That's what morals are.",

   "From the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: \nReason generally is understood as the principles for a methodological inquiry, whether intellectual, moral, aesthetic, or religious. Thus is it not simply the rules of logical inference or the embodied wisdom of a tradition or authority. Some kind of algorithmic demonstrability is ordinarily presupposed. Once demonstrated, a proposition or claim is ordinarily understood to be justified as true or authoritative. Faith, on the other hand, involves a stance toward some claim that is not, at least presently, demonstrable by reason. Thus faith is a kind of attitude of trust or assent. As such, it is ordinarily understood to involve an act of will or a commitment on the part of the believer.\n http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/faith-re.htm",

Calling homosexuality inferior to heterosexuality in some way, accomplishes only bad things like fear, shame, guilt, etc., in people.

He hasn't changed his moral stance, he's just ignoring it temporarily. When the heat of the moment passes he would once again recognize that killing is wrong. I myself have done things that I wish I hadn't, things that I knew were immoral. (nothing too bad :) ) I did them out of laziness or shelfishness, not because I actually thought they were the right thing to do. Most people want to do the right thing all the time, but I don't know anyone who could honestly claim to have pulled it off. We all make mistakes, we all have moments of weakness.

Do good, don't do bad. Help people, don't harm them. However, the actions you describe, stealing to feed your starving family, involves both good and bad. For the actions you describe to be considered moral you would need to add up the total good, subtract the total bad, and end up with positive \"goodness\". Of course, good and bad are rarely easy to quantify, and so people can legitimately come up with different answers. The basic principles haven't changed though, that's my point. You don't have to invent a whole new set of guidelines and tack them on to the existing moral system to reach a moral decision here. You are right that people may reach different conclusions, but they're using the same moral principles to reach them.",
