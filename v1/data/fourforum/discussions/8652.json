This shows our military is VERY weak. How can we allow our soldiers to go out and rape and kill a family of the Iraqis?!? What were they thinking if we have people this stupid in our military how could we win any REAL war here at home. I'm outraged this was allowed to happen I would hope any commanding officers at that post are all dishonorably discharge there is no excuse for what they allowed to happen under their command. I would hope if we are going to rape and kill innocent people our military would be the ones to be able to get away with it, seems that's not the case here.",

However when you join the military it is a job where they pay you to perform a service. Therefore making it a business ran by the government. If anything the real world business rules should apply to the military. Meaning lets say your working at wal-mart and your the guy/gal who walks around keeping things clean, sorted, stocked and helping customers. Now lets say since your 17 you really could care a less about your job so you slack off. Now lets say your supervisor allows this slack off lots of times and each time he does you slack off even more not being afraid of getting into trouble. Then one day you take it to the extreme, clock in and leave an go back home and go to sleep. This is reported to the GM of the store and lets say just for theories sake the GM does nothing. Now we have a huge snowball effect here, we are getting pretty high into the company where people don't care about what is going on either because they hate their job, their life, or they hate the companies ideas. This should of NEVER been allowed to happen. I would discharge the recruiter who recruited these people, the drill instructor, ect. everyone who had anything to do with this that allowed murders and rapist into our military force. Like I said this story proves to me just how stupid our military is...... can you really rely on people like this to protect the American people?",

   "I've came to what I think is a reasonable solution to our problem here. Let's face the facts these guys are over there seeing headless bodies shipped back to their post and lots of other things we/they should never see. I think you would all agree with me that after seeing this type of stuff for even 6 months you would start to go a bit crazy maybe even insane. \n \n Now for our solution. We have a small force of psychologists that have NOTHING to do with the military no training no nothing its a thrid party that gets involved. They simply check the soldiers by sitting down with them in an environment that is safe and just talk to the soldiers and find out if they are still mentally healthy to be in combat and if not they are simply sent back out of combat. Now I realize this will bring up a few points that would make this hard 1. being how many people would try to fake it just to get out of combat. 2. lost my train of thought but I'm sure there are more holes in this plan. Regardless though if our psychologists were good enough they should be able to figure out who is really healthy and who is not even if the soldiers were trying to lie to them. Tell me what you think?\n \n \n P.S.

   "Not at all was I insinuating that I think they should be able to get away with it. However I am a smart person and I know how males are. Put a bunch of males together in a foreign place and make them go a year without having sex with a female. You'd have to be very blind not to think lust would overcome them at some point. Furthermore you'd have to assume it's going to happen and if it's going to happen you would hope that the people committing the dishonorably act to at least get away with it to up hold the military creed. We all know their is corruption in our military, I'm just stating I realize it will happen no matter what you think or believe, just stating I wish they were at least smart enough to get away with it, what we don't know won't hurt them in this case our relation with the Iraqi people. I realize this is making me look pro rape/murder but that's simply not that case as I stated all of those commanding officers should ALSO be dishonorably discharged.\n\n \n \n You've got to be kidding! Men can't control themselves? Lust will overcome us? And the VERY few bad apples DON\"T get away with it because we don't tolerate that sort of behavior. Pure statistics show that for every 100000 people a certain number of rapes will be committed and I'm confident that the cases/100K of rape when dealing with military people is less then an average 100K people in country! There's SOME corruption in ANY organization, from the UN to the Catholic church! Our military is by far a more just and honorable organization than your typically find anywhere!",

Comparisons of the crime rates of civilian and military populations during peacetime periods in 1986&#8211;92 reveal that contemporary peacetime rates of rape by American military personnel are actually lower (controlling for age and gender) than civilian rates. However, the data also indicate that peacetime military rape rates are diminished far less from civilian rates than are military rates for other violent offenses. This &#8220;rape differential&#8221; is also reflected in the World War II data: U.S. Army rape rates in Europe climbed to several times the U.S. civilian rates for that period, while military rates for other violent crimes were roughly equivalent to civilian rates. Thus, in both contexts studied, a rape differential exists: the ratio of military rape rates to civilian rape rates is substantially larger than the ratio of military rates to civilian rates for other violent crimes\n \n http://www.answers.com/topic/rape-by-military-personnel\n \n \n Other violent crimes violent crimes in general by today's vets who are out of the military...\n \n So, using the lowest of the lowball numbers -- 121 acts of mayhem out of 700,000 veterans spread over six years &#8211; yields a rate of 17.28/100,000 veterans overall. But the New York Times numbers are misleading. This is because with that 121, we now learn that they included 22 cases of DUI, two cases of speeding, three situations which even the prosecution said were handgun accidents, and most incredibly, five cases where the accused was completely exonerated or their actions were determined (in a trial) to be in self-defense. So subtracting those out and the actual number that should be considered is 12.7/100,000. But that would be for a single year, and this needs to be spread out over six years.\n \n Mind you, that is also if you stick with the probably low 700,000 number of total Iraq/Afghanistan vets.\n \n \n Mind you we should also look at those stationed elsewhere. Let's try Japanoned!\n \n SOFA personnel comprise approximately 3.9 percent of the populating and committed about 1.7 percent of crimes (average, 1972-2001), or about half as much crime compared to the entire population of Okinawa. In the past ten years of data (1992-2001) SOFA personnel committed only 0.82 percent of crimes in Okinawa, or nearly five times less than the general population.

However, the requirements for militarily personnel have been going up, so I don't see any reason for the stats (criminal) to go up as the quality of recruit goes up. You can see the statistics are recent (I think the 1st one is thru 2006). I don't know why you'd be surprised to find that soldiers are 'better than average'. The modern military is comprised of sophisticated, well trained people who've volunteered. Their quality is significantly higher than the 'average' in this country!",
