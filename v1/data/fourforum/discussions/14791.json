   "Lukashenko uses threats to Russia that in case of disavowal of the results of next president elections in Belarus he would withdraw from all post Soviet integrations! What is it? May be blackmail? I can't understand but I countenances that he is going mad. I knew always that he is all-overish man but what is he trying to prove?\n It's too hard for me to understand what for has he fobbed us off with promises during lust fifteen years? Look, if he can to separate with all of it that all his actions were made for nothing! Well, he destroyed own country, realized very strange economy and policy for the sake of his own actions! Now I know that by those words Lukashenko proved just his political failure and our own stupidity!",
