Ali...\n \n http://www.sullivan-county.com/x/honor_killings.htm\n \n And here an excerpt from it.\n When one examines the facts and logistics of Islamofascist aggression -- both in history and modern times -- it is hard to argue that the basis for this aggression is Western influence on the Islamic culture. If this were the sole reason for Islamofascist aggression there would be no excuse for attacks in the name of Islam on the Hindus or Buddhists or in any nation that doesn' t embrace Western values such as Thailand, Somalia or most of Indonesia. Yet, the slaughter of innocents in the name of Islam does take place against these people and in these non-Westernized regions.\n \n By acknowledging these facts -- and they are indisputable -- we can dismiss the argument that the US and the West have brought the wrath of Islamofascism upon ourselves, which is the basis for the argument used by the anti-war movement, the American Fifth Column and disingenuous and opportunistic politicians.\n \n What, then, is the catalyst for Islamofascist aggression and what could be so powerful as to produce legions of suicide bombers and those willing to die, without reservation, for their cause?\n \n While the many elements of this subject are complex, together they indicate an overall agenda that is not.\n \n In almost every declaration and action of the Islamofascist, from Osama bin Laden to Hassan Nasrallah, Ayman al Zawahri to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the goal is the same: the successful establishment of a global Islamic state -- or Caliphate -- ruled under Sharia Law. This notion is not a supposition on my part. Rather, it is an accurate observation, based on understanding and acknowledging the actions taken and the words used by each of these fascist leaders (note the correct usage of the word fascist).\n \n In his 1996 fatwa, Osama bin Laden proclaimed:\n \n \". . .O you horses (soldiers) of Allah ride and march on. This is the time of hardship so be tough. And know that your gathering and co-operation in order to liberate the sanctities of Islam is the right step toward unifying the word of the Ummah under the banner of 'No God but Allah'. . .Our Lord, shatter their gathering, divide them among themselves, shaken the earth under their feet and give us control over them. . .\"\n It should be noted that to bin Laden, the Ummah is considered a figurative nation comprised of all Muslims and all Islamic nations.\n \n In 2000 bin Laden declared:\n \n \". . .Afghanistan is the only country in the world that has the Shari'ah. Therefore, it is compulsory upon Muslims all over the world to help Afghanistan. And to make hijra to this land, because it is from this land that we will dispatch our armies to smash all kuffar all over the world.\"\n In October of 2005, during his address to the United Nations, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said:\n \n \"From the beginning of time, humanity has longed for the day when justice, peace, equality and compassion envelop the world.\"\n And in a speech to Friday prayer leaders he said:\n \n \"Our revolution's main mission is to pave the way for the reappearance of the 12th Imam, the Mahdi.\"\n It should be noted here that Ahmadinejad believes -- as do most Shi'ites -- that the 12th Imam (or Muhammad al-Mahdi), according to their interpretation of the Quran, will bring \"peace and justice on earth\" by establishing Islam throughout the world. This equivalent of the \"second coming\" would take place when the world has fallen into chaos and civil war emerges between the human race for no reason.\n \n If we are to take the leaders of the Islamofascist movement at their word -- and the leaders of the United States and the West have been delinquent in accepting the declarations of fascists in the past, so much so that world war has ensued -- we can only surmise that the battles taking place between Sunni and Shi'ite factions in Iraq, Gaza and elsewhere in the world are for dominance in what they perceive as an inevitable global Islamic Caliphate.\n \n It is crucial that the United States government -- and all the governments of the West -- dispense with the political infighting that currently holds hostage national unity and the collective will, so we can defend ourselves from the inevitable full-scale confrontation with an emboldened and strengthening Islamofascist movement. The first step to achieving this unity is an honest, comprehensive understanding of the enemy. The education to achieve that end must begin immediately.\n \n Make no mistake. We are essentially re-visiting the ominous days of 1938. It took everything that the freedom loving people of the world could muster to vanquish evil then. This time we may not be so lucky. This time the forces of evil will have nuclear capability.\n ",

If this were the sole reason for Islamofascist aggression there would be no excuse for attacks in the name of Islam on the Hindus or Buddhists or in any nation that doesn' t embrace Western values such as Thailand, Somalia or most of Indonesia. Yet, the slaughter of innocents in the name of Islam does take place against these people and in these non-Westernized regions.\n \n By acknowledging these facts -- and they are indisputable -- we can dismiss the argument that the US and the West have brought the wrath of Islamofascism upon ourselves, which is the basis for the argument used by the anti-war movement, the American Fifth Column and disingenuous and opportunistic politicians.\n \n What, then, is the catalyst for Islamofascist aggression and what could be so powerful as to produce legions of suicide bombers and those willing to die, without reservation, for their cause?\n \n While the many elements of this subject are complex, together they indicate an overall agenda that is not.\n \n In almost every declaration and action of the Islamofascist, from Osama bin Laden to Hassan Nasrallah, Ayman al Zawahri to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the goal is the same: the successful establishment of a global Islamic state -- or Caliphate -- ruled under Sharia Law. This notion is not a supposition on my part. Rather, it is an accurate observation, based on understanding and acknowledging the actions taken and the words used by each of these fascist leaders (note the correct usage of the word fascist).\n \n In his 1996 fatwa, Osama bin Laden proclaimed:\n \n \". . .O you horses (soldiers) of Allah ride and march on. This is the time of hardship so be tough. And know that your gathering and co-operation in order to liberate the sanctities of Islam is the right step toward unifying the word of the Ummah under the banner of 'No God but Allah'. . .Our Lord, shatter their gathering, divide them among themselves, shaken the earth under their feet and give us control over them. . .\"\n It should be noted that to bin Laden, the Ummah is considered a figurative nation comprised of all Muslims and all Islamic nations.\n \n In 2000 bin Laden declared:\n \n \". . .Afghanistan is the only country in the world that has the Shari'ah. Therefore, it is compulsory upon Muslims all over the world to help Afghanistan. And to make hijra to this land, because it is from this land that we will dispatch our armies to smash all kuffar all over the world.\"\n In October of 2005, during his address to the United Nations, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said:\n \n \"From the beginning of time, humanity has longed for the day when justice, peace, equality and compassion envelop the world.\"\n And in a speech to Friday prayer leaders he said:\n \n \"Our revolution's main mission is to pave the way for the reappearance of the 12th Imam, the Mahdi.\"\n It should be noted here that Ahmadinejad believes -- as do most Shi'ites -- that the 12th Imam (or Muhammad al-Mahdi), according to their interpretation of the Quran, will bring \"peace and justice on earth\" by establishing Islam throughout the world. This equivalent of the \"second coming\" would take place when the world has fallen into chaos and civil war emerges between the human race for no reason.\n \n If we are to take the leaders of the Islamofascist movement at their word -- and the leaders of the United States and the West have been delinquent in accepting the declarations of fascists in the past, so much so that world war has ensued -- we can only surmise that the battles taking place between Sunni and Shi'ite factions in Iraq, Gaza and elsewhere in the world are for dominance in what they perceive as an inevitable global Islamic Caliphate.\n \n It is crucial that the United States government -- and all the governments of the West -- dispense with the political infighting that currently holds hostage national unity and the collective will, so we can defend ourselves from the inevitable full-scale confrontation with an emboldened and strengthening Islamofascist movement. The first step to achieving this unity is an honest, comprehensive understanding of the enemy. The education to achieve that end must begin immediately.\n \n Make no mistake. We are essentially re-visiting the ominous days of 1938. It took everything that the freedom loving people of the world could muster to vanquish evil then. This time we may not be so lucky. This time the forces of evil will have nuclear capability.\n \n\n \n This is just propaganda. Why are you so afraid?",

   "Our troops were stationed in Saudi Arabia on 9-11. Bush ignored the Clinton administrations warnings about Al Quedia.\n\n \n That Air base was built by express request of the Saudi's. It wasn't forced on them at all. And it was Clinton who ignored the warnings about Al-Queda from the Clinton Administration. Here, read it and weep...\n The 9/11 warnings Bill Clinton missed and opportunities to kill Bin Laden\n \n Posted: Saturday, September 8, at 1:12 pm\n \n One year after the first World Trade Center bombing in 1994, Bill Clinton hushed up a federal report that warned of possible terrorist strikes, including how hijackers could use airliners to hit landmarks such as the Pentagon or White House.\n \n The Clinton administration never released \"Terror 2000\" to the public, purportedly because of concerns in the State Department it would cause panic.\n \n The Sept. 17, 2001 story by UPI Pentagon correspondent Pam Hess said the report, not only outlined the changing face of terrorism but also seemed to predict the scope and timing of the attacks carried out against the World Trade Center and Pentagon.\n \n \"Targets such as the World Trade Center not only provide the requisite casualties but because of their symbolic nature provide more bang for the buck. In order to maximize their odds for success, terrorist groups will likely consider mounting multiple, simultaneous operations with the aim of overtaxing a government's ability to respond, as well as to demonstrate their professionalism and reach,\" states \"Terror 2000.\" The report was compiled in 1994 after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, from research and interviews of 41 intelligence, government and private industry experts, including foreign governments such as Israel and Russia.\n \n \"Terror 2000\" was distributed to the Defense Department, State Department, FEMA, intelligence communities and members of Congress on June 24, 1994, according to author Marvin Cetron as reported in Newsmax\n \n On December 4, 1998, Former President Bill Clinton received a Presidential Daily Briefing entitled, Bin Laden Preparing to Hijack US Aircraft and Other Attacks. This was almost three years before the 9-11 attacks.\n \n On November 4, 1998, one month prior to the daily briefing, an indictment against Bin Laden was unsealed, charging him with conspiracy to attack U.S. defense installations.\n \n In September, 1999 Bill Clinton received a federal reportthat warned terrorists could hijack a plane and crash it into the Pentagon or another government building.\n \n The report, titled Sociology and Psychology of Terrorism: Who Becomes a Terrorist and Why?,\" cautioned that Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network might seek revenge for the 1998 U.S. air strike on bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan.\n \n \"Suicide bomber(s) belonging to al-Qaida's Martyrdom Battalion could crash-land an aircraft packed with high explosives (C-4 and semtex) into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), or the White House,\" the September 1999 report said.\n \n Reports published just two months after 9/11 explained that the blueprint for 9/11 attacks was uncovered during 1995 interrogations of Abdul Hakim Murad, partner of convicted 1993 World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef.\n \n According to the Washington Post, Yousef's plot to plant bombs on 12 commercial U.S. airliners and blow them up over the Pacific \"called for a second, perhaps even more ambitious phase, as interrogators discovered when they pressed Murad about his pilot's license.\n \n \"All those years in flight school, he confessed, had been in preparation for a suicide mission. He was to buy, rent, or steal - that part of the plan had not yet been worked out - a small plane, preferably a Cessna, fill it with explosives and crash it into CIA headquarters.\"\n \n The Post continued: \"There were secondary targets the terrorist cell wanted hit: Congress, the White House, the Pentagon and possibly some skyscrapers. The only problem, Murad complained, was that they needed more trained pilots to carry out the plot.\"\n \n What's clear is that under Osama bin Laden's direction, the two plots were merged, and Murad's Cessna suicide mission evolved into the hijacking of four commercial U.S. airliners. In fact, the 1997 Daily News report says that while Murad attended U.S. flight schools, he \"studied 747s.\"\n \n This information was available to President Clinton via published reports [if not through the intelligence briefings he routinely avoided] for most of his second term in office.\n \n Former Ambassador to the Sudan Tim Carney confirmed that the Clinton administration refused an offer from the Sudanese government to hand over terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden in the late 1990s - directly contradicting former Clinton administration officials who have attacked the story as baseless.\n \n \"In fact, what was offered [by the Sudanese] was to expel bin Laden to Saudi Arabia, and the Saudis, because he was such a hot potato, simply refused to handle him,\" Carney told Fox News Channel's Alan Colmes.\n \n \"Then, as I understand it, there was an offer to send him to us,\" Carney recalled. The Clinton administration rebuffed the overture because, Carney said, \"we did not have an indictment [against bin Laden] at the time.\"\n \n Carney's account corroborates the claims of Pakistani-American freelance diplomat Mansour Ijaz, who has maintained for months that the Clinton administration blew a crucial opportunity to take bin Laden out of circulation and ultimately foil the 9-11 terrorist attacks.\n \n While the press has largely ignored Ijaz's claims, former Clinton officials have launched a fierce campaign to undermine his credibility and keep him from testifying before Congress.\n \n \"Mr. bin Laden used to live in Sudan,\" Clinton explained to a Feb. 15 Long Island Association luncheon. \"He was expelled from Saudi Arabia in 1991, then he went to Sudan. And we'd been hearing that the Sudanese wanted America to start meeting with them again. \"They released him,\" the ex-president confirmed.\n \"At the time, 1996, he had committed no crime against America so I did not bring him here because we had no basis on which to hold him, though we knew he wanted to commit crimes against America\". \"So I pleaded with the Saudis to take him, 'cause they could have,\"\n \n Clinton explained. \"But they thought it was a hot potato and they didn't and that's how he wound up in Afghanistan.\"\n \n \n In the waning days of the Clinton presidency, senior officials received specific intelligence about the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and weighed a military plan to strike the suspected terrorist mastermind's location. The administration ultimately opted against an attack.\n \n A secret CIA videotape shows that the Clinton administration had pinpointed the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden a year before the 9/11 attacks, but declined to kill him because of White House orders that he should be taken alive.\n \n The video, obtained and broadcast by NBC News, \"illustrates an enormous opportunity the Clinton administration had to kill or capture bin Laden,\" the network reported.\n \n Images filmed in Afghanistan by CIA Predator Drones show a man clad in white robes who towers over his entourage. (Bin Laden is 6' 5\" tall.)\n \n The film was shot over Tarnak Farm, the walled compound where bin Laden was believed to live at the time. The layout of the buildings in the Predator video perfectly matches previous photos and diagrams of Tarnak Farm prepared by U.S. intelligence.\n \n The clip left CIA analysts convinced they had located the man who in 1998 had bombed U.S. embassies in East Africa and whose agents, four years earlier, had detonated a bomb in the parking garage of the World Trade Center.\n \n \"It's dynamite. It's putting together all of the pieces, and that doesn't happen every day,\" said William Arkin, a former intelligence officer and now military analyst for NBC.\n \n Though President Clinton has boasted repeatedly that he issued orders to kill bin Laden, no action was taken when the White House finally got its chance.\n \n Gary Schroen, a former CIA station chief in Pakistan, told NBC that the White House had in fact ordered the CIA to do just the opposite - take bin Laden alive or not at all.\n \n The order \"reduced the odds from, say, a 50 percent chance down to, say, 25 percent chance that we were going to be able to get him,\" Schroen told the network.\n \n Former National Security advisor Sandy Berger claimed the Pentagon never gave authorization to strike, yet that is the job of the commander-in-chief of the military to issue the order to the military to strike, not the Pentagon to issue a strike.\n \n The directive effectively killed the plan and, along with it, the U.S. greatest chance to prevent the 9/11 attacks. Watch actual CIA footage: NBC exclusive video.\n \n (You can click this link to the portrayal of the ABC tv show The Path to 9-11 portraying the event that the CIA had Bin Laden on target. This is the video that Bill Clinton wanted to have edited.\n \n Former CIA terror analyst Michael Scheur admitted that Bill Clinton had at least 8 to 10 chances to kill or capture Bin Laden, but Bill Clinton refused to have him killed or captured.\n \n In the latest Executive Summary just released, it slams the Clinton administration for the failure to have a comprehensive report laying out the threats focusing on Bin Laden written after the 1993 World Trade Center attack.\n \n * U.S. spy agencies, which were overseen by Tenet, lacked a comprehensive strategic plan to counter Osama bin Laden prior to 9/11. The inspector general concluded that Tenet \"by virtue of his position, bears ultimate responsibility for the fact that no such strategic plan was ever created.\"\n \n * The CIA's analysis of al-Qaida before Sept. 2001 was lacking. No comprehensive report focusing on bin Laden was written after 1993, and no comprehensive report laying out the threats of 2001 was assembled. \"A number of important issues were covered insufficiently or not at all,\" the report found.\n \n * The CIA and the National Security Agency tussled over their responsibilities in dealing with al-Qaida well into 2001. Only Tenet's personal involvement could have led to a timely resolution, the report concluded.\n \n * The CIA station charged with monitoring Bin Laden - code-named Alec Station - was overworked, lacked operational experience, expertise and training. The report recommended forming accountability boards for the CIA Counterterror Center chiefs from 1998 to 2001, including Black.\n \n * Although 50 to 60 people read at least one CIA cable about two of the hijackers, the information wasn't shared with the proper offices and agencies. \"That so many individuals failed to act in this case reflects a systemic breakdown.... Basically, there was no coherent, functioning watch-listing program,\" the report said. The report again called for further review of Black and his predecessor.\n Perhaps Hillary Clinton was right when she recently stated that the next terrorist attack would help Republicans. Her husband never removed Saddam Hussein from power in 1998, when he signed into law \"The Iraq Liberation Act\" to remove Saddam Hussein from power. He had a dismal record of fighting terror,and he had 8 to 10 chances to capture or kill Bin Laden, yet he refused to give the order to have him killed.\n http://www.hillaryproject.com/index.php?/en/print_story/the_9_11_warnings_bill_clinton_missed_and_opportunities_to_kill_bin_laden/",

Would you open your arms to the Iranian invaders and occupiers?\n\n \n That's not really a correct analogy.\n \n A more accurate one would be:\n 'What would you think if your gov't allowed in the French to deal with those rat-fink Mexicans who, under Poncho Villa IX kept crossing out borders to attack American towns and villages and threatened to launch a whole scale invasion of Texas to 'reclaim it'. And were also eyeing California and other SW states.\n And daily their citizens kept crossing the border and breaking our laws.\n \n Would you support the French, or that fringe group of malcontented Hispanics of Mexican descent who actively championed for all of the US to unite with Mexico and the rest of central America into a super-state under Catholic inspired laws complete with burning stakes for the heathen and pagan idoloters.\n \n I mean...it IS the FRENCH!\n They want all our women. Talk funny. Eat Cheese and have poor bathing skills. And their puppet state Quebec is also annoying and keeps taunting Mexico in the UN...by refusing to cease to exist. I mean, who likes the French Canadians? Not even the Canadians like 'em.\n \n Yeah...lets support radical LULAC and their terroristic ways. Because they'd be better than out own ruling government currently run by El Presidente Jose Hernandez.\n \n So, if El Presidente Hernandez invited the disgusting French in to deal with the real threat of Mexico...then I don't see why people would complain. Many would like to sell them goods and services here. Provided they stay out of our holy sites, Memphis and Las Vegas and kept their greesy hands off our women folk...I don't see much of a problem.\n And so long as Ponche Villa IX is residing in Mexico, I see no problems allowing the barbaric and uncouth French to inhabit a few bases in New Mexico and Arizona while they fly bombing sorties against military instillations in Mexico.\n After all, since Napoleon XX rules France and has such extreme influence in the world, we stand a good chance of profiting off of our relationship with him. And we might even be able to use some leverage into getting the French Canadians to cede territory they occupied from the native Americans during the \"We all hate Quebec\" wars of 1616, 1732, 1888 and 2020. \n \n Oh, and if I was a non-Catholic Mexican, I might even like the French to come in and bash in Poncho Villa's head...and wipe out his loyal armed forces...and fight the rabid Catholic Costa Ricans and Guatamalans who come in to destabalize my country and kill all indiscrimiatly and seek to enforce stake burnings if they were to ever take over.\n Heck, I might even want such to happen if I were a Catholic Mexican because Poncho's rule really wasn't helping the people.",

   "What would be your position if Iran was occupying the United States? What would be your position if you watched as Iranian bombs killed your family and loved ones and destroyed your villages and cities? Would you open your arms to the Iranian invaders and occupiers?\n\n \n Your questions have no relevance in reality Abe because we weren't EVER occupying Saudi Arabia which is Osama Bin-Ladens Home Country. Neither were we bombing Saudi Arabia in any way at all, EVER. You seem to be confusing going to War with a Nation State and having civilians taking the law into their own hands by committing violence against the civilian populations in order to manipulate Public Policy of Governments around the World which Osama does regularly.\n \n If anything Saudi Arabia is one of the richest kingdoms on Earth specifically because of the United States as it was our skill, manpower, capital and technology that originally built the first oil wells that made them so wealthy. And if we didn't make Saudi Arabia so wealthy Bin-Ladens father never would have gotten so wealthy building mosques and other Palaces for the Royal's in that Country. So rather than condemn the USA, he, as the inheritor of around 150 million dollars of his families fortune should appreciate what America has done for him personally.\n \n http://www.saudiembassy.net/Publications/magspring96/aramco.html\n The history of the company is one of close Saudi-U.S. cooperation and spectacular accomplishments in the face of long odds. It took five years of hard work under harsh conditions in the desert before the well known as Dammam Number 7 hit oil in commercial quantities. On May 1, 1939, King Abdul Aziz boarded the tanker D.G. Scofield in Ras Tanura to turn the valve that let the first barrel of Saudi oil enter a tanker for export.\n The period immediately following the end of World War II was one of intense activity. New deposits were being discovered with increasing regularity, pumping, pipeline and treatment facilities were expanded and new offices, warehouses and housing were built. By 1949, the company's production capacity had reached 500,000 bpd. To circumvent the cost and time of shipping oil to Mediterranean ports via the circuitous route around the Arabian Peninsula and through the Suez Canal, the company built Tapline, a 31-inch pipeline that initially carried 320,000 bpd of crude from the production facilities in the Eastern Province through northern Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon to the Mediterranean. Although the pipeline was expanded in later years, the civil war in Lebanon, coupled with the construction of other pipelines across Saudi Arabia and the development of more cost-effective ultra-large oil tankers led to cessation of its use to deliver oil to the Mediterranean.\n As the company and its production capacity continued to grow, so did its requirements for highly-skilled and well-trained manpower. Whereas the original geologists, engineers and technicians who helped start operations in the 1930s were primarily American, by the 1950s, the majority of company employees were Saudi Arabians.

   "Your questions have no relevance in reality Abe because we weren't EVER occupying Saudi Arabia which is Osama Bin-Ladens Home Country. Neither were we bombing Saudi Arabia in any way at all, EVER. You seem to be confusing going to War with a Nation State and having civilians taking the law into their own hands by committing violence against the civilian populations in order to manipulate Public Policy of Governments around the World which Osama does regularly.\n \n If anything Saudi Arabia is one of the richest kingdoms on Earth specifically because of the United States as it was our skill, manpower, capital and technology that originally built the first oil wells that made them so wealthy. And if we didn't make Saudi Arabia so wealthy Bin-Ladens father never would have gotten so wealthy building mosques and other Palaces for the Royal's in that Country. So rather than condemn the USA, he, as the inheritor of around 150 million dollars of his families fortune should appreciate what America has done for him personally.\n \n http://www.saudiembassy.net/Publications/magspring96/aramco.html\n The history of the company is one of close Saudi-U.S. cooperation and spectacular accomplishments in the face of long odds. It took five years of hard work under harsh conditions in the desert before the well known as Dammam Number 7 hit oil in commercial quantities. On May 1, 1939, King Abdul Aziz boarded the tanker D.G. Scofield in Ras Tanura to turn the valve that let the first barrel of Saudi oil enter a tanker for export.\n The period immediately following the end of World War II was one of intense activity. New deposits were being discovered with increasing regularity, pumping, pipeline and treatment facilities were expanded and new offices, warehouses and housing were built. By 1949, the company's production capacity had reached 500,000 bpd. To circumvent the cost and time of shipping oil to Mediterranean ports via the circuitous route around the Arabian Peninsula and through the Suez Canal, the company built Tapline, a 31-inch pipeline that initially carried 320,000 bpd of crude from the production facilities in the Eastern Province through northern Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon to the Mediterranean. Although the pipeline was expanded in later years, the civil war in Lebanon, coupled with the construction of other pipelines across Saudi Arabia and the development of more cost-effective ultra-large oil tankers led to cessation of its use to deliver oil to the Mediterranean.\n As the company and its production capacity continued to grow, so did its requirements for highly-skilled and well-trained manpower. Whereas the original geologists, engineers and technicians who helped start operations in the 1930s were primarily American, by the 1950s, the majority of company employees were Saudi Arabians. In the 1960s and 1970s, tens of thousands of Saudis were sent to training centers established in the Kingdom and thousands completed their education at universities. By the end of the latter decade, Saudis were in most of the management and technical positions in the company.\n So you can see, according this saudi aramco web site that it was America who found and harvested the wealth of the Saudi's and the fact that they are one of the richest Nations on Earth is self evident proof that we didn't steal their Natural Resources as some will accuse us of. The fact is that the original Oil Concessions in Saudi Arabia were put up for bids and we outbid the Brits by offering more money, better support and more security for the Industry than any other Country seeking to harvest their oil. So please get your facts right before always condemning the US first in favor of defending the Terrorists who seek to manipulate the Public Policies of Governments even though they don't represent any Country at all.\n \n Now I answered your questions Abe, but as usual you have evaded mine.

   "\"rules of War concerning Terrorists\" (sic)\n \n Could you show us these \"rules\" please?\n\n \n Have you ever heard of the Geneva Convention? Do you know how to use a search engine? Here's a Q and A from the BBC you might be able to follow to get you started if you really want to learn something.\n \n Q&A: Geneva rules and the 'war on terror'\n The British Defence Secretary John Reid has called for a re-examination of the rules of war. In particular he asked whether the Geneva Conventions on humanitarian law are adequate in an age of international terrorism.\n \n What are the Geneva Conventions?\n \n The Geneva Conventions are a group of international treaties designed to protect the sick or wounded, prisoners of war and civilians. They had their origin in the 19th Century, when a Swiss businessman Henri Dunant witnessed the slaughter at the Battle of Solferino in 1859 in Northern Italy, part of the struggle for Italian unification.\n \n Mr Dunant helped treat the wounded in a church. He subsequently founded the International Committee of the Red Cross and in 1864 the first convention for the protection of wounded soldiers was signed by 12 states.\n \n What do the conventions say?\n \n There are four conventions, which were signed in 1949, with two additional protocols in 1977.\n \n The First Convention was a follow-up to the 1864 agreement and protects sick and wounded soldiers.\n \n The Second Convention extends protection to those fighting at sea.\n \n The Third Convention covers prisoners of war and says they must be protected from harm and not prosecuted for lawful actions on the battlefield.\n \n The Fourth Convention was new in 1949 and, drawing on the experience of civilian suffering in World War II, stated that civilians must not be deliberately targeted.\n \n What is the issue raised by Mr Reid?\n \n This concerns the Third Convention, covering prisoners of war. He argued that it needed re-examination because international terrorists are not listed as being eligible for prisoner of war status and, therefore, fall into a grey area. The convention's Article 3 says that combatants have to be identified and under proper command if they are to claim POW status. Mr Reid did not propose any specific changes but hinted that the convention should be extended to cover this gap in some way, perhaps by legalising the long-term detention of al-Qaeda-type prisoners.\n \n How could the conventions be extended to al-Qaeda if it attacks civilians?\n \n This would be a problem as the conventions outlaw any attack directed solely or mainly at civilians, which is what al-Qaeda specialises in. And to gain POW status, combatants have to follow the conventions. One idea would be that an international terrorist ignoring such rules of war might be liable to detention without having the full protection of POW status.\n \n Do the Geneva Conventions cover the Guantanamo Bay prisoners?\n \n Some argue that they should, but the US says that they do not, on the grounds that the prisoners are \"unlawful combatants\" and are not in the categories listed for protection by the Third Convention. The US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales once called the Geneva Conventions \"quaint\". However, the US also says that the prisoners are treated in accordance with the \"principles\" of the Third Convention and other humanitarian law.\n \n By denying them formal POW status, the US is free to interrogate them, something prohibited by the Third Convention, which requires POWs to give only their name, rank, age and number.\n \n Does the Third Convention not require that a prisoner's status be determined?\n \n Yes. It lays down that a tribunal has to determine if someone is a combatant and whether he or she falls into a protected category. The US has introduced tribunals at Guantanamo Bay to determine a prisoner's \"combatant status\" and some have been released or sent back to their home countries as a result. But as the US does not accept the application of the Geneva Conventions at the camp, those found to be \"combatants\" are still held as before.\n \n So what legal status do the Guantanamo Bay prisoners have?\n \n The British Appeal Court said in 2003 that they were in a \"legal black hole\". They are not formal POWs and are on territory controlled but not owned by the US, so their access to US courts was at first denied. Their position was improved somewhat in 2004 when the US Supreme Court ruled they were allowed to petition the US courts under the ancient law of habeas corpus, according to which detention has to be justified. The extent to which they can do this is currently under challenge by the US Government.\n \n Do the Conventions prohibit torture and ill treatment?\n \n Yes, and so does the separate UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Degrading or Inhuman Treatment or Punishment from 1985. The United States says it does not torture prisoners and a recent US law made clear that cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment is not permitted by any US personnel anywhere. However, US interrogation methods permit some procedures that the US says fall short of such treatment.\n \n The US-based human rights organisation Human Rights Watch says the ability of prisoners to get redress is limited by a new law and that information acquitted through \"coercion\" might still be used against them.\n \n Mr Reid called Guantanamo Bay an \"anomaly\". What does he mean?\n \n He means that the camp falls outside normal international law. However, he is less clear about how to end this anomaly. There are two ways to get rid of an anomaly. The first is to remove the anomaly itself. This would mean closing the camp and either charging or releasing the prisoners or restricting their movements to some degree.\n \n The other way is to remove the situation under which something becomes an anomaly. If international law were changed to allow for detention of al-Qaeda suspects, the \"anomaly\" would disappear. Mr Reid hinted that this was what he meant.\n \n What about the two other issues - self-defence and humanitarian intervention?\n \n Mr Reid argued that the principle of self-defence should be extended. At the moment self defence is allowed if a country is attacked or if an attack is imminent. Mr Reid thinks that the word \"imminent\" should be redefined to include, for example, the threat from preparations for international terrorism.\n \n As for humanitarian intervention, the UN has looked at this and came up with the concept of a \"responsibility to protect.\" If a government fails, as in Rwanda for example, then other countries have the right to intervene. Mr Reid appears to want this made more active.\n \n What are the chances of getting changes agreed?\n \n Very low at the moment. Many governments and human rights organisations say that no changes are needed and that terrorist suspects should be charged, freed or have restrictions placed on them in some other way. And there is suspicion of the US and UK governments following the invasion of Iraq.\n \n Paul.Reynolds-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk\n \n Story from BBC NEWS:\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/world/americas/4879942.stm\n \n ",

   "So why did the US attack Iraq? Iraq was a sovereign nation that posed no threat to the US.\n\n \n Once again you make absolute statements with no supporting facts to back your claims at all. Here is a link that belies your unsubstantiated claim very convincingly, with an excerpt from it.\n \n http://www.intellectualconservative.com/article2691.html\n The War with Iraq\n \n The war against Iraq should be seen in the context of the principles mentioned above. Firstly, Iraq posed a threat to the regional stability in the Middle East and Central Asia in terms of its continued pursuit of WMD-capability. And if Saddam Hussein acquired nuclear weapons it would have had devastating consequences. We all agreed -- including the UN Security Council by its unanimous adoption of Resolution 1441-- that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to the international community. Iraq's use of WMD against Iran and the Kurdish minority in Iraq in the 1980's combined with the continued refusal of Saddam Hussein to cooperate with the international community on disarmament simply was not acceptable in a post-9/11 world.\n \n Secondly, one of the lessons learned from leaving Afghanistan unsupervised under the Taliban regime during the 1990's was that rogue states and the rise of so-called power vacuums create safe havens for ter-rorists and terrorist organizations. In a post 9-11 environment this is not acceptable. \n \n Thirdly, the Iraqi regime's continued breach of Security Council resolutions posed a severe threat to the UN's authority in the international system, which the Danish Government could not accept. The Danish Government deeply regrets that it proved impossible to maintain the unity of the Security Council in the face of Saddam Hussein's blatant refusal to render the immediate, active and unconditional cooperation required by Resolution 1441. The months that passed since President Bush made his case in New York on September 12th, 2002 should have been sufficient to deal with Iraq's failure over the preceding twelve years to comply with the demands of the international community. Had the Security Council faced up to its responsibility, the use of force might well have been avoided. Instead, the coalition took action to finish the job that Saddam Hussein never intended to complete. Furthermore, the Danish Government believes the military action was based on sufficient authority and legitimacy under existing resolutions. \n \n Fourthly, we owed the Iraqi population an end to the years of suffering brought upon them by a ruthless dictator. The findings of thousands of bodies in mass graves after the war have only reinforced this notion. \n \n Finally, but just as importantly, the Danish Government believes that it was right to show solidarity with the United States in its fight against a repressive tyrant. In the last century, the United States has come to our help on numerous occasions. In the First and Second World Wars. By securing our freedom during the Cold War. And by US resolve in the Balkans in the 1990's, when bloody civil wars plagued the region and European leaders were hesitant. We felt that it was our duty to support the United States when the call was -- for once -- coming from the other side of the Atlantic. As our Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated on March 26, \"Only the Americans have the military strength to disarm Saddam and liberate Iraq. But we have an obligation to help. We cannot just sail under a flag of convenience and let others fight for freedom and peace. There has in fact been too much of that kind in the past in Denmark. If we mean anything seriously about our democratic values, then we should also be ready to make a small contribution to the international coalition.\"\n And here is a link to Hillary's speech justifying the invasion in no uncertain terms with another excerpt.\n \n http://clinton.senate.gov/speeches/iraq_101002.html\n Floor Speech of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton\n on S.J. Res. 45, A Resolution to Authorize the Use of\n United States Armed Forces Against Iraq\n \n As Delivered\n \n Today we are asked whether to give the President of the United States authority to use force in Iraq should diplomatic efforts fail to dismantle Saddam Hussein's chemical and biological weapons and his nuclear program.\n \n I am honored to represent nearly 19 million New Yorkers, a thoughtful democracy of voices and opinions who make themselves heard on the great issues of our day especially this one. Many have contacted my office about this resolution, both in support of and in opposition to it, and I am grateful to all who have expressed an opinion.\n \n I also greatly respect the differing opinions within this body. The debate they engender will aid our search for a wise, effective policy. Therefore, on no account should dissent be discouraged or disparaged. It is central to our freedom and to our progress, for on more than one occasion, history has proven our great dissenters to be right.\n \n Now, I believe the facts that have brought us to this fateful vote are not in doubt. Saddam Hussein is a tyrant who has tortured and killed his own people, even his own family members, to maintain his iron grip on power. He used chemical weapons on Iraqi Kurds and on Iranians, killing over 20 thousand people. Unfortunately, during the 1980's, while he engaged in such horrific activity, he enjoyed the support of the American government, because he had oil and was seen as a counterweight to the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran.\n \n In 1991, Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait, losing the support of the United States. The first President Bush assembled a global coalition, including many Arab states, and threw Saddam out after forty-three days of bombing and a hundred hours of ground operations. The U.S.-led coalition then withdrew, leaving the Kurds and the Shiites, who had risen against Saddam Hussein at our urging, to Saddam's revenge.\n \n As a condition for ending the conflict, the United Nations imposed a number of requirements on Iraq, among them disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, stocks used to make such weapons, and laboratories necessary to do the work. Saddam Hussein agreed, and an inspection system was set up to ensure compliance. And though he repeatedly lied, delayed, and obstructed the inspections work, the inspectors found and destroyed far more weapons of mass destruction capability than were destroyed in the Gulf War, including thousands of chemical weapons, large volumes of chemical and biological stocks, a number of missiles and warheads, a major lab equipped to produce anthrax and other bio-weapons, as well as substantial nuclear facilities.\n \n In 1998, Saddam Hussein pressured the United Nations to lift the sanctions by threatening to stop all cooperation with the inspectors. In an attempt to resolve the situation, the UN, unwisely in my view, agreed to put limits on inspections of designated \"sovereign sites\" including the so-called presidential palaces, which in reality were huge compounds well suited to hold weapons labs, stocks, and records which Saddam Hussein was required by UN resolution to turn over. When Saddam blocked the inspection process, the inspectors left. As a result, President Clinton, with the British and others, ordered an intensive four-day air assault, Operation Desert Fox, on known and suspected weapons of mass destruction sites and other military targets.\n \n In 1998, the United States also changed its underlying policy toward Iraq from containment to regime change and began to examine options to effect such a change, including support for Iraqi opposition leaders within the country and abroad.\n \n In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001.\n \n It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.\n \n Now this much is undisputed. The open questions are: what should we do about it? How, when, and with whom?\n Now read it and reap abe, and while you're at it, take the honest out of your name because you don't know the meaning of the word. Call yourself \"revisionist history abe\", that's more accurate.",

Nobody can know everything about anything.\n \n Your Xtian charity toward the disabled and the cognitively challenged is noted.\n\n \n And you're right, I apologize to the handicapped because comparing them to your comprehension skills is an insult to them. ;) \n \n \nHave you ever heard of the Geneva Convention? Do you know how to use a search engine? Here's a Q and A from the BBC you might be able to follow to get you started if you really want to learn something.\n \n Q&A: Geneva rules and the 'war on terror'\n The British Defence Secretary John Reid has called for a re-examination of the rules of war. In particular he asked whether the Geneva Conventions on humanitarian law are adequate in an age of international terrorism.\n \n What are the Geneva Conventions?\n \n The Geneva Conventions are a group of international treaties designed to protect the sick or wounded, prisoners of war and civilians. They had their origin in the 19th Century, when a Swiss businessman Henri Dunant witnessed the slaughter at the Battle of Solferino in 1859 in Northern Italy, part of the struggle for Italian unification.\n \n Mr Dunant helped treat the wounded in a church. He subsequently founded the International Committee of the Red Cross and in 1864 the first convention for the protection of wounded soldiers was signed by 12 states.\n \n What do the conventions say?\n \n There are four conventions, which were signed in 1949, with two additional protocols in 1977.\n \n The First Convention was a follow-up to the 1864 agreement and protects sick and wounded soldiers.\n \n The Second Convention extends protection to those fighting at sea.\n \n The Third Convention covers prisoners of war and says they must be protected from harm and not prosecuted for lawful actions on the battlefield.\n \n The Fourth Convention was new in 1949 and, drawing on the experience of civilian suffering in World War II, stated that civilians must not be deliberately targeted.\n \n What is the issue raised by Mr Reid?\n \n This concerns the Third Convention, covering prisoners of war. He argued that it needed re-examination because international terrorists are not listed as being eligible for prisoner of war status and, therefore, fall into a grey area. The convention's Article 3 says that combatants have to be identified and under proper command if they are to claim POW status. Mr Reid did not propose any specific changes but hinted that the convention should be extended to cover this gap in some way, perhaps by legalising the long-term detention of al-Qaeda-type prisoners.\n \n How could the conventions be extended to al-Qaeda if it attacks civilians?\n \n This would be a problem as the conventions outlaw any attack directed solely or mainly at civilians, which is what al-Qaeda specialises in. And to gain POW status, combatants have to follow the conventions. One idea would be that an international terrorist ignoring such rules of war might be liable to detention without having the full protection of POW status.\n \n Do the Geneva Conventions cover the Guantanamo Bay prisoners?\n \n Some argue that they should, but the US says that they do not, on the grounds that the prisoners are \"unlawful combatants\" and are not in the categories listed for protection by the Third Convention. The US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales once called the Geneva Conventions \"quaint\". However, the US also says that the prisoners are treated in accordance with the \"principles\" of the Third Convention and other humanitarian law.\n \n By denying them formal POW status, the US is free to interrogate them, something prohibited by the Third Convention, which requires POWs to give only their name, rank, age and number.\n \n Does the Third Convention not require that a prisoner's status be determined?\n \n Yes. It lays down that a tribunal has to determine if someone is a combatant and whether he or she falls into a protected category. The US has introduced tribunals at Guantanamo Bay to determine a prisoner's \"combatant status\" and some have been released or sent back to their home countries as a result. But as the US does not accept the application of the Geneva Conventions at the camp, those found to be \"combatants\" are still held as before.\n \n So what legal status do the Guantanamo Bay prisoners have?\n \n The British Appeal Court said in 2003 that they were in a \"legal black hole\". They are not formal POWs and are on territory controlled but not owned by the US, so their access to US courts was at first denied. Their position was improved somewhat in 2004 when the US Supreme Court ruled they were allowed to petition the US courts under the ancient law of habeas corpus, according to which detention has to be justified. The extent to which they can do this is currently under challenge by the US Government.\n \n Do the Conventions prohibit torture and ill treatment?\n \n Yes, and so does the separate UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Degrading or Inhuman Treatment or Punishment from 1985. The United States says it does not torture prisoners and a recent US law made clear that cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment is not permitted by any US personnel anywhere. However, US interrogation methods permit some procedures that the US says fall short of such treatment.\n \n The US-based human rights organisation Human Rights Watch says the ability of prisoners to get redress is limited by a new law and that information acquitted through \"coercion\" might still be used against them.\n \n Mr Reid called Guantanamo Bay an \"anomaly\". What does he mean?\n \n He means that the camp falls outside normal international law. However, he is less clear about how to end this anomaly. There are two ways to get rid of an anomaly. The first is to remove the anomaly itself. This would mean closing the camp and either charging or releasing the prisoners or restricting their movements to some degree.\n \n The other way is to remove the situation under which something becomes an anomaly. If international law were changed to allow for detention of al-Qaeda suspects, the \"anomaly\" would disappear. Mr Reid hinted that this was what he meant.\n \n What about the two other issues - self-defence and humanitarian intervention?\n \n Mr Reid argued that the principle of self-defence should be extended. At the moment self defence is allowed if a country is attacked or if an attack is imminent. Mr Reid thinks that the word \"imminent\" should be redefined to include, for example, the threat from preparations for international terrorism.\n \n As for humanitarian intervention, the UN has looked at this and came up with the concept of a \"responsibility to protect.\" If a government fails, as in Rwanda for example, then other countries have the right to intervene. Mr Reid appears to want this made more active.\n \n What are the chances of getting changes agreed?\n \n Very low at the moment. Many governments and human rights organisations say that no changes are needed and that terrorist suspects should be charged, freed or have restrictions placed on them in some other way. And there is suspicion of the US and UK governments following the invasion of Iraq.\n \n Paul.Reynolds-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk\n \n Story from BBC NEWS:\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/world/americas/4879942.stm\n \n \n",
