   "Police officers of Latvian (and me among them) prefer to resign from their job as soon as possible. The reason is not only low wages (but of course many of us have families with children). We are sick and tired of licking feet of every possible ragtag especially those bloody chechens - they are full of money and cheek like lords, wheel and deal mostly massive criminal cases but also never strain at minor deals like trading in prostitution. Here you put the snatch on one of them, he makes a call and in ten minutes or so some high-ranking official calls back and says we have to release him. Of course we do offering our apologies. And these rascals only sneer in return and sometimes threaten with short work. Bastards! There is absolutely nothing we can do. That's why we prefer quitting to stay on the safe side. As for me, I'm not going to be back until they put it to rights at the \"top\".",
