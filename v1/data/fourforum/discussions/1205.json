For all those people who always bring up images of the great freedom that we fought and died for, you may want to do a little bit more research. It was not only unnecessary to separate from Britain, but also a bit selfish. At the time of the American Revolution, the colonists/Americans were the least taxed and had the highes standard of living in the western world. And once they did win independence, not much really changed. If anything, conditions got worse. And although its popular these days to hate terrorists, some Americans were terrorists against the British. The somewhat famous Nathaniel Hale, often believed to have been hanged by the British for espionage, was in fact hanged because he attempted to burn down British quarters. Sounds surprisingly similar to the many attacks on U.S. troops in the middle east.\n \n Yeah, I'm not quite sure what that has to do with the topic.

   "Here is a list a of links to second amendment court cases. http://www.abanet.org/gunviol/courts.html\n \n I know that Kelvin will probably continue to bury his head in the sand, but I post this link for the benefit of others who are interested in finding out the truth. \n \n The American Bar Association, an organization which represents lawyers and accredits law schools in the US, explains that:\n \n \"The lower federal courts have uniformly followed the interpretation of the Supreme Court. No legislation regulating the private ownership of firearms has been struck down in our nation's history on Second Amendment grounds. \n \n Yet the perception that the Second Amendment is somehow an obstacle to Congress and state and local legislative bodies fashioning laws to regulate firearms remains a pervasive myth. The gun lobby has conducted extensive and expensive campaigns to foster this misperception and the result has been that the myth of the 'absolute bar of the Second Amendment' has real effects on regulatory efforts.\n \n As lawyers, as representatives of the legal profession, and as recognized experts on the meaning of the Constitution and our system of justice, we share a responsibility to the public and lawmakers to 'say what the law is.' \"\n http://www.abanet.org/gunviol/secondamend.html\n\n \n Fine, call a cop. Tell them you what to take my supposed \"illegal\" guns. If anyone trys that I'll slap them so hard with a civil rights violation law suit they will have marks from my hand on both sides of thier face.\n \n Oh BTW the way, it has already been tried. A woman at gas station called a cop on me for having an open carried firearm. Guess who the cops got angry at? Not me.",

   "Ok i think its time i introduced some greek philosophy into this debate. once upon a time there was a man named Plato. Plato came up with this idea for a perfect society. the main idea behind this society was that the good of the many outweighs the good of the one. he also goes on to talk about a man who is all knowing being murderd by his homeys because hes smarter than them. well up in canada where we actully care about our countrys best intrests we have something called gun control. basiclly this prohibits the averge joe going to the local wal mart and buying an M-16. if one were to look at the number of gun murders in the united states which last i heard was hovering around 11000 per year, and we look at the number of gun murders in great britain, which has even stricter gun control laws, we see that the number of gun murders decreases by around 10961. now we have to factor in the population diffrence and figure out how many murders that is per capita\n the population of great britain is right around 60 000 000. so we divide by 60000000 and we get approximatly 2. now lets divide that by 39 and we get 0.0000065. hmmm..... well i dont think that anybody can debate that having 100000 fewer gun murders percapita is a bad thing. anyways back to plato. If the U.S.A does not implement gun control, then what we will eventually get is a country with a massive and powerful army that will be used primarily for internal affairs, while other countrys will build up their armies to protect themselves from american attack, thus plunging the world into another cold war. oh by the ways thats a bad thing",

That is the essence of the system we both live in - rules defined by courts, not by gun-worshipping organisations.

You're against smoking near anyone else (of course you're going to say not in a private home - but what about the rights of kids to have good air?)\n \n What you believe to be lawful etc, simply chops and changes depending on whether you like it or not.

   "OK thanks. I am patient enough for a court to make the act of yelling \"fire\" when there is none a lie.\n \n BTW every citizen above the age of 18 is in the militia.\n\n \n You still don't get it.\n \n What is a lie, to you and me (read my post - I said, we'd both reckon it to be a lie) is not enought for it to be a lie 'in law'.\n \n It has to be proven in a court for the law to recognise it is a lie, otherwise, in law, it isn't. :)\n \n You for instance might think I'm an idiot. You could get a dozen people to agree with you, BUT in law, this is not good enough.\n \n If you called me an idiot, I could take you to court for deformation. I might win. In law, you have not proven your case. You still might call me an idiot, but as far as the law is concerned, I'm not.\n \n This is because the legal reality may differ from the 'real world'.\n \n Take another example. Here in New South Wales, person 'A' was issued with an Original Birth Certificate, upon his birth; there are blank spaces for father and mother because these were not known. Later he was adopted. The adpoting parents had the certificate amended at time of adoption to have their names put in as parents.\n \n When Person 'A' gets to be 18 and he wishes for a copy of his Original Birth Certificate, he applies for it, and he gets the one amended, because in law, it is the 'original' though in reality it isn't. This is what we call a legal fiction. He could keep demanding his 'original', and the Department of Births, Deaths and Marriages would keep issuing it... only they'd be issuing the amended one... because as far as they are concerned, it is legally the original.\n \n It is quite clear from my discussions with you that you are not well versed with matters legal. I am endeavouring to explain these to you, but either I'm failing as a communicator, or you're pretty thick.\n \n Your views on shouting 'fire' are a prime example. I have stated again and again, your opinion, my opinion for that matter, do not matter. As far as the law is concerned, it has to have been proven in court to have been a lie - unless your laws provide for some other body to adjudicate. It is the law that decides who adjudicates whether it is a lie or not. Not you, not I.\n \n So, when you harp on about legal rights, they are only rights, as determined by law. Your belief in 'Free Speech' must constantly be tested in court...\n \n Several posters, including myself have already shown that your Constitutional right for freedom of religion has been abridged by your courts - the Mormon Case was cited.\n \n Again, we've shown you that your right to carry a gun, has been interpreted by the courts as being valid only within the context of being a member of a militia. Your only retort is - why haven't they come for your guns, if they are illegal.\n \n I don't know why the police in your country are so poor - this is demonstrated by the fact that they arne't prosecuting you, as well by the various pro-gun posters who have stated quite frankly that they feel the need to have guns, because the police are unreliable.\n \n I know for a fact that Mormon communities in Utah continue to live in polygomous relationships, this despite the fact that its against the law. It still remains against the law, even if the police don't act.",

Your only retort is - why haven't they come for your guns, if they are illegal.\n\n \n All US citizens of 18 years and older are in the militia. Then by that militia only argument means all citizens older than 17 years are protected to bear arms.\n \n My \"only' retort is \"they have not come for my guns, if...\"? My other retort is that they have not come for my guns because I am in the militia.\n \n Not only is the government prohibited from taking my guns. The government encourages me to train with military weapons. \n \n http://www.odcmp.com/Services/Rifles/index.htm\n \n The CMP sells discounted suplus military rifles and ammo for training. If you do not want the retired rifles, they give you \"coupons\" to buy modern AR-15/M-16s at a discount from the manufacture.\n \n To qualify to purchase these rifles or get a coupon all you need to do is 1) be a basic good standing citizen older than 17. 2) Shoot a match with a club. The clubs will even loan you a rifle to shoot a match and sell discounted surplus ammo. You do not even have to prove you hit the target. All you have to do is show up and squeeze rounds down range.\n \n So not only is the government prohibited from taking my military rifles, they are making easy for me to obtain one. So \"They\" are almost giving away the rifles and ammo. So how does illegal fit in?\n \n A lie? In said example. I'll still wait for the court to stamp the act of yelling \"fire\" a lie. Then I'm still right and your wrong. Yelling \"Fire\" is not speech. It does not conform to artistic, political, economic, or communication. It is deception. It just took time for a said court to catch up with the facts. It is a deception with intent to deny rights of others to peacable assembly. It a deception to deny the right movie goers and theatre owner to complete a contract. It is a deception to deny the civil rights of movie goers and theatre owner. Violating civil rights of others is not a protected act in the Constitution.\n \n BTW in the other thread? Ever figure out which NRA policies and practices deny the civil rights non-white people?",

I am willing to entertain more relavant examples of ME(?) violating someone elses rights\n \n With the same thought. I was in McDonalds after work today because I was to lazy to cook. With a .45 on my hip, how did I violate other peoples rights today in MCDonalds?\n \n Did I deny someone free speech? Did I deny someone the right to contract. Did I deny someone right to property? Did I deny someone the right to life? Did I deny someone to illegal search or seizure? How about privacy?\n \n You accused me of affecting someones right, I must violated someone in McDonalds? Please specify a right that I affected and how I affected that right.\n\n \n That is a perfectly relevant example. I'm not saying that it was wrong for you to impinge the homeless man's rights or that it was wrong for him to impinge your rights. I'm not saying that what you did was wrong. I'm simply saying that what you did impinged another person's right and so to say that your rights extend as far as they don't violate another person's rights is simply wrong.\n \n By simply carrying your gun in McDonalds, you didn't greatly impinge anyone's rights. You could analyze the air flow created by carrying your gun or the change in weighting, and you would find that you were violating someone's rights. Yeah, it sounds silly, and I'm not saying that that is why you shouldn't carry a gun. I'm simply saying that since your rights affect everyone and everything, they are not absolute.\n \n By the way, where in the Constitution are we guaranteed the right to life?",

Be sure to run past attackers side opposite to where he is holding a weapon. Not as effective as a bullet, but a much more painful way to become disabled.

But although that right is not specifically mentioned in the Constitution (and neither is the absolute right to bear arms or the absolute right of anything), it is a right that must be considered. In fact, your favorite document (when you think it helps you), the Constitution of the United States of America, states in Amendment 9, \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\" That means that although the right to not be intimidated is not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, it is a right of the people. And your idea, \"well if it isn't in the Bill of Rights, then it isn't a right,\" is exactly what the Federalist leaders feared in having a Bill of Rights. Yes, that's right, your favorite people, the authors of the Federalist Papers, those American heros, Madison, Hamilton, and Jay, did not want a Bill of Rights because they feared exactly what you have been saying.

There should be gun control, because as in all parts of life, there must be a balance. You can't have your absolute rights. That's been my whole point. Now, I don't want you to have your gun, I don't want anyone to have his or her gun. But I don't think the solution is a complete gun ban because that would just add to your and other people's unfounded fears and suspicions. Those fears and suspicions are the problem in America, and guns are just a manifestation of that problem. I'm not sure what the solution to this is yet, but I know that a complete gun ban isn't it.

   "\n The right to self defense is considered by most people to be a natural one. And given the choice, many would choose to protect themselves with a firearm\n\n In Morton Grove, Illinois the town leaders passed a law which required everybody to turn in their handguns to the police station. A federal appeals court upheld the law as being constitutional and said that it didn't violate the 2nd, 9th, or 14th amendments. The court rejected the argument that the 9th amendment protects a right defend yourself with a firearm. \n \n \"Appellants argue that, although the right to use commonly-owned arms for self-defense is not explicitly listed in the Bill of Rights, it is a fundamental right protected by the ninth amendment....Since appellants do not cite, and our research has not revealed, any Supreme Court case holding that any specific right is protected by the ninth amendment, appellants' argument has no legal significance. Appellants may believe the ninth amendment should be read to recognize an unwritten, fundamental, individual right to own or possess firearms; the fact remains that the Supreme Court has never embraced this theory.\"\n Quilici v.
