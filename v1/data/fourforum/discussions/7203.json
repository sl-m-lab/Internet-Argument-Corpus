Seeing how they argue and what kinds of thought processes (or emotional processes), the various 'believers' put forth is interesting'\n \n 2) The 'creationists' often have a political adgenda to try to sneak their religious views to be taught in public school as if they were scientific fact.

Science, evolution in particular, has gradually eroded the religious dogma that for over a millenia dictated who we are and why we are here, just because thats what the people who controlled the dogma told us. That dogma has been shown to be false on numerous occasions and studies of sciences like evolution have help take the blinkers off our religion dominated societies. Off course the dogma advocates still fight to re-introduce their control, and such conflicts reveal much about the nature of their postion. \n \n So what I'm driving at is the question of how we came to be has far to many connertations in our existence to simply say \"Could we possibly just accept that we got here somehow, and just move on?\"",

Interest in and participation in forum discussions of any nature should be welcomed without the insulting verbal warfare that comes with differing belief systems. The creation/evolution beliefs differ enough that promoters of each cannot understand the other.\n \n The two cannot be detached from the history of human life.

Even elephants have a sense of family loss when some long lived matriarch bites the dust.\n \n Mankind has likely always wondered where we came from and where we&#8217;re headed.
