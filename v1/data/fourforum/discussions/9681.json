   "Found this posted over at IIDB.org, and thought it looked very interesting.\n NYTimes: Scientist Finds Beginnings of Morality in Primate Behaviour\n \n Here's a snippet : \nSome animals are surprisingly sensitive to the plight of others. Chimpanzees, who cannot swim, have drowned in zoo moats trying to save others. Given the chance to get food by pulling a chain that would also deliver an electric shock to a companion, rhesus monkeys will starve themselves for several days.\n \n Biologists argue that these and other social behaviors are the precursors of human morality. They further believe that if morality grew out of behavioral rules shaped by evolution, it is for biologists, not philosophers or theologians, to say what these rules are.\n \n Moral philosophers do not take very seriously the biologists' bid to annex their subject, but they find much of interest in what the biologists say and have started an academic conversation with them.\n \n The original call to battle was sounded by the biologist Edward O. Wilson more than 30 years ago, when he suggested in his 1975 book \"Sociobiology\" that \"the time has come for ethics to be removed temporarily from the hands of the philosophers and biologicized.\" He may have jumped the gun about the time having come, but in the intervening decades biologists have made considerable progress. \n \n Last year Marc Hauser, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, proposed in his book \"Moral Minds\" that the brain has a genetically shaped mechanism for acquiring moral rules, a universal moral grammar similar to the neural machinery for learning language. In another recent book, \"Primates and Philosophers,\" the primatologist Frans de Waal defends against philosopher critics his view that the roots of morality can be seen in the social behavior of monkeys and apes.\n \n <snip< \n",

They try to reduce it to evolved social behavior. I think it is a bit more than that. But it isn't a question of right and wrong, since that question question is relative. Is it wrong to kill another human? Then how can christians support the execution of so many criminals in Texas. How could we grunts be assured by chaplains that it was right to kill cong or ARVN. The question is relative.",

   "What is most interesting is that after allegedly 300 million plus years of the evolutionary process taking place, only now are we seeing the slightest signs of empathy being shown in ONLY chimps and Apes.\nRead it again and try for comprehension. Chimps are apes.\n \nNo other primates have evolved such abilities.\nFunny, the article specifically mentioned other primates that demonstrated such characteristics. Did you read the article?\n \nI SUGGEST THESE AREN'T NEWLY EVOLVED CHARACTERISTICS BUT HAVE ALWAYS EXISTED WITHIN THEIR GENETIC MAKE UP.\nBut these organisms haven't always existed.\n \nI ALSO SUGGEST THERE IS NO GENETIC EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT APES AND CHIMPS HAVE CHANGED ON THE MOLECULAR LEVEL WHAT SO EVER.\nAgain, chimps are apes. And there is evidence that they have changed. Orangs, gorillas, and chimps all differ genetically from each other and from humans. Has anyone ever told you about human chromosome 2? Would you like me to explain this little bit of evidence to you?\n \nBUT LEAVE IT TO THIS FRAUDULENT SCIENCE TO REPORT THIS STORY AS IF IT'S NEW INFORMATION.\nNo. Not new. Just more supporting evidence in more detail. Funny how creationists always claim that disagreement in \"scientific dogma\" isn't allowed and is, in fact, repressed. Well here you have a disagreement - published. All it took was some actual evidence. How about some evidence from creationists?",
