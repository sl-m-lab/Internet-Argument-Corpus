   "1. The Jewish people are God chosen people and God granted the Jewish people the Holy Land.\n \n 2. The Israelis won the 1968 War capturing the land fair and square. \n \n Both of these points many Jewish and Christian people believe to be true. It is the Old Testament of the Bible that refers to these things about the Jewish people before there were any Christians and Muslims in the world. It was the Jewish prophets saying the things that the Jewish people copy and translated it to other people. The second point only the supporters of the Greater State of Israel believe to be true. The Palestinian supporters believe nothing has been fair nor any Justice for the Palestinian people since the beginning of the Zionist movement in the early nineteen hundreds. The founding of the new state of Israel was forced onto the Palestinian people in 1948 and the 1967 War was a continuation of the expansion of the Greater State of Israel. \n \n Neither the Israelis nor Palestinians ever followed the United Nations Resolution 181 creating two states out of the Holy Land. Today the Israelis totally control the Holy Land while saying the Palestinian people are terrorists. For every innocent Israeli child killed or maimed there are four innocent Palestinian children in the same spot. The living conditions for the Palestinian people continuing to worsen during the so called peace talks of the 90's while the Israeli Jewish settlements in the West Bank are doubling in numbers, size and population. \n \n If a Palestinian kills an Israeli it is headline news in the American mass media with the Jewish people being the only victims. If an Israeli kills a Palestinian they are a terrorists. The main image via Israel that most Americans receive is the Palestinian people are protesters, terrorists and unruly. So many of the so called terrorist experts and Israeli government talking heads repeat the same lines that Hamas wants to remove the State of Israel from the map and run all of the Jewish people into the sea. When a person looks at history and the reality on the ground in the Holy Land today. The facts will tell you this is exactly what the Jewish people have been doing to the Palestinian people over the last sixty years.",

   "A massive infusion of international capital and humanitarian aid being invested into the new State of Palestine creating a strong and viable economy and job opportunities for the Palestinian people. Unemployment has been running between 40% and 70% in the Palestinian Territories for many years. Democracy without job opportunities for the people will not work. By creating job opportunities and an independent State for the Palestinian people the dignity of the Palestinian people will begin to be restored. \n \n The Israeli government agreeing to turn over in good shape the Israeli settlements in the West Bank to the State of Palestine. Some of the Israeli Settlements surrounding East Jerusalem will become an International Green Zone with final terms to be worked out. Israel will gain a great deal of international legitimacy among the international community of nations. With a temporary moratorium on new immigrates or the return of people to Palestine and Israel the problem of those there today can be workout. The Israelis agreeing to down size their military industrial complex that is mostly government owned and Palestine agreeing not to create one. A twenty-year master plan must be developed and implemented with the tourism industry being the economic cornerstone of the region. \n \n By creating a peaceful and civil way for the people of the region to settle their grievances and differences civil order will develop. Only by building the confidence of the people on both sides will trust of one and another develop. For this term of time the international community will have play a major role with operations being based in the International Green Zone. There are many considerations that have be considered in the twenty-year master plan from the preservation of the religious Holy sites to security and the development of a commercial tourism industry. Only if both sides profit from the tourism generated dollars will peace prosper in the Holy Land. \n For the Government of Israel to agree to compromising terms for peace the United States Government and the European Union guarantee the national security of the State of Israel from military attacks from foreign governments. All regional and national government will have to work in cooperation against the acts of terrorisms by disgruntled individuals and fringe groups that remain out side the peace process. The slate of pass actions will be wiped clean on both sides regarding individuals and groups being tried for War Crimes, only the future actions of possible war crimes could be tried. An Authority of Property and Personal Disputed will have to be established to help settle old grievances between the Palestinian people and the Israelis. The Israeli government will handle the financial reimbursement of the Jewish Settlers for relocating backed by a financial package from the United States Government. The Authority of Property and Personal Disputed will handle the financial reimbursement to the Palestinian people by a financial package from the Arab nations and European Union. \n \n As conditions improve in the Palestinian community so too will the relationship between the people opening the door for new opportunities. With the up coming Palestinian elections there is a chance for major changes for the better for the people on both sides if an international commitment is made as well as the governments on both sides. \n \n My Blog http://www.globalcrier.blogspot.com/",
