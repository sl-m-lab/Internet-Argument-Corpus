Craig is doubtlessly the product of his time and religious culture and has no doubt suffered as a result. However, so are thousands of other gay men of his generation who haven't chosen his particular path of attacking by daylight what he secretly practices by night and behind toilet doors.\n \n Craig is getting what he deserves.

We all have enough information about how hypocritical it would be if someone like Senator Craig were to actually BE gay and vote in such an anti-gay manner. I won't bother making that point since I frankly don't think voting to hurt people is justified no matter what your sexual orientation.\n \n Ironically on the LGBT blogs and \"insider lists\" today there was a huge discussion about whether or not Senator Craig should garner some sympathy from the community because of the historic antipathy that exists towards police entrapment methods against, particularly, gay men.\n \n But seeing his performance, I have lost any notion of sympathy.

   "How many of these incidents will it take before America realizes that the family values crowd is a big, fat fraud? They are a batch of moralizing molesters, pious pervs, closeted creeps and values voyeurs. It is time the right just closes shop and stops pointing fingers - because we have no idea where those sticky fingers have been.\n \n In recent memory, we have been treated to Florida Republican Rep. Mark Foley's preoccupation with teenage pages; The National Association of Evangelical's leader Ted Haggard's working relationship with escort Mike Jones; Florida Republican legislator Bob Allen getting arrested in a park restroom for soliciting oral sex from a police officer; The arrest of Southern Baptist Convention leader Lonnie Latham in Oklahoma City on a lewdness complaint for allegedly propositioning a plainclothes policeman; and Indiana Young Republican National Federation leader Glenn Murphy resigning after police charged him with sexually assaulting a Young Republican friend, while his comrade was napping in a drunken stupor.\n \n Forgive me if I missed a tawdry scandal, but I would need a Republican database of disgrace to keep track. Or, I could always call Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jim Naugle for the \"facts.\" The mayor is so gay sex obsessed that he recently tried to raid the city's treasury to buy robo-johns to prevent gay men from getting it on. But, it turned out the mayor may actually have issues, when the police said gay bathroom sex was a non-issue.\n \n If people, such as Naugle, have problems with restroom sex, they only have themselves to blame. Fundamentalism is the primary cause, not the solution to such behavior. People such as the moralizing mayor have made every effort to publicly shame gay people - inevitably driving some individuals to join conservative political movements and engage in shameful actions.\n \n Interestingly, Fort Lauderdale televangelist D. James Kennedy, who Naugle praises as a great man, retired the same week that Sen. Craig's secret was revealed. Kennedy's church, Coral Ridge Ministries, was the lead sponsor of the 1998 million-dollar ex-gay \"Truth In Love Campaign,\" that caused a national uproar. While the religious right heaps effusive praise on Kennedy, the Craig incident reminds us that Kennedy-type anti-gay crusades have probably lead more closeted married men to bathroom glory holes, than to the glory of God.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \u00a9 2007 Wayne Besen.

   "An excerpt from a perceptive article:\nFirst, we must learn how to distinguish the differences between sexual behavior, sexual identity and sexual orientation. Sen. Craig has vehemently denied that he is a gay man and I personally believe him.\n \n Since Sen. Craig clearly attempted to engage in gay sexual behavior but publicly denies a gay sexual identity does this mean that he is in sexual denial or perhaps deeply closeted? Not necessarily. Often men who engage in the underground culture of public restroom, rest stop, tea room sex do so as an act of sexual titillation, sexual release, and an immediate sexual gratification. \n \n They are fueled by the sexual thrill of getting caught, doing something that is taboo and the potential danger of seeking out homoerotic encounters with men who otherwise would strictly identify as heterosexual. \n \n So in every sense and definition of the word, the sex that these men have is truly, utterly and exclusively recreational. It is void of emotional value, love, respect, intimacy or an expectation of a romantic relationship to come. For them having male-to-male sex is truly a sport, a hobby, a distraction and a pastime or rebellion against convention with no emotional attachment or desire for more.\n \n To further understand how a straight man could engage in gay sex and still genuinely not identity as gay in terms of his sexual identity or sexual orientation, we must remember that it is physically possible for any person to have sex with either gender regardless of their individual level of emotional attachment.\n \n A so called 100% gay man may still be capable of having sexual relations with a woman. So does this automatically make him straight or bisexual? Not necessarily. Just because he is capable of having sex with a woman doesn't mean he wants to have a relationship with one, hence our clear understanding of sexual orientation must come into play.\n \n Understanding Gay Sexual Orientation\n \n What we feel emotionally is what defines our sexual orientation not our sexual activity. I personally am a gay man. I only desire to be in a relationship with another man. However, in the past I have had sex with women specifically my former wife. For a time while we were together she was my exclusive sexual partner. I am still physically capable of being attracted to women. \n \n But my emotional desire is to partner with another man, not a woman. Hence my true sexual orientation is gay, not straight or bisexual.\n \n I potentially could have as much illicit heterosexual sex as I want with women but at the end of the day, I will always return back to the loving arms of another man. It's just how I am wired. I romantically love and romantically desire to be with another man.\n \n Well for Sen. Craig, I believe that he romantically loves and romantically desires to be with a woman and although he may recreationally have sex with other men, his true loving desire is for women and not for men.\n \n Society must come to terms with the fact that not everyone who has gay sex is necessarily gay. Although it may be a difficult concept for some to comprehend; gay sexual behavior does not equate to gay sexual orientation.\n \n Understanding Gay Identity\n \n We live in a society that is determined to categorize and force people into a box, assigning them with a ratings value of good or bad based upon their race, class, culture and sexual identification.\n \n Today for an individual to self-identity as gay, they seemingly must take on an image created by the media that is based upon societal stereotypes. For men, we must be either feminine or super gym macho bunnies. We must be either florists or hairdressers or super witty, smart, affluent and overly-successful. But all too often, the gay identity most exclusively seen and portrayed is that of white men and their lives (i.e. Will and Grace, XXXXX as Folk).\n \n In fact members of the Black community have for years rejected the term \"gay\" and instead have embraced the term same-gender-loving (SGL) for the exact same reasons. The term gay to them means white, privileged and without regards to people of color, their issues or their situations.\n \n So to embrace a gay identity we must also accept an entirely media driven, prescribed and induced armor to wear and to show the world that this is who we are and that this is what we feel. \n \n Sen. Larry Craig rejects this identify, because simply this is not who he is. He is a conservative, married man who has very little in common with America's gay identity. In fact he is perfectly valid in stating that he is not a gay man.\n",

Posted August 30, 2007.\n \n \n It's time for Republicans to embrace their own gay wing and stop fueling the sickness of suppression that drives men like Larry Craig into airport bathroom stalls. \n \n The demise of Idaho Republican Senator Larry Craig amuses those of us who enjoy watching right-wing heroes crash to the ground, spiked on their own hypocrisy. It further confirms my theory: pr!ck any conservative and the kink oozes out. The rockier the rib, the more likely you'll find pink lingerie under the trousers or a bullwhip and manacles in the bedside drawer. You can bet those Beltway dominatrices, madams and escorts (gay and straight) have been able to buy second homes -- maybe even in Sun Valley! -- with their haul during W's reign.\n \n However, because we are people of compassion, we should also feel a little horrified by this tortured man's sad, humiliating demise. He's obviously lived his whole life afflicted by the religious psychobabble and outright bigotry of people who say homosexuality is a sickness and a lifestyle decision instead of an innate state of being that has nothing to do with illness or choice.\n \n The sickness, of course, is in the suppression, which is why closeted men seek love in rank public bathroom stalls.\n \n The Republican Party got Bush re-elected in 2004 by playing the homophobe card. In Ohio, their minions went door-to-door in Amish country and warned the historically non-secular inhabitants that if they didn't get out and register Republican, gay marriage would be the law of the land. Tens of thousands of Amish men and women hitched horses to buggies, cracked their whips, and raced to the nearest polling place to vote to repel the Sodomites. With their unprecedented help, Ohio, that crucial state, slid ever so narrowly into the red column, sending the Bush regime back to the White House with four more years to plot how to bomb Tehran.\n \n The trouble with this wedge issue, as everyone now knows, is that it's Republican suicide. The hateful public stance of the party has driven its many gay members into ever more contorted acts of self-loathing excess, driving the disease of suppression out in the open and subjecting men to public stoning by their own frenzied followers.\n \n Foley, Haggard and Craig are only the most famous. There's Florida Rep. Bob Allen, also caught lurking for sex in a public bathroom, Corporal Matt Sanchez, gay porn star and -- for a shining moment -- Fox News channel's right wing Marine of the moment. And who can forget Jeff Gannon, the right-wing faux journalist with a secret life as a gay escort favored with a hard (yes!) White House press pass by the Bush administration communications department.\n \n Yesterday, Republicans were sprinting away from shiny-shod, crisply cuffed mountain man Larry. Craig \"represents the Republican Party,\" Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Republican of Michigan, said. You got that right, Pete! And then: \"I think it's important for Republicans to step out right now and say, 'No, this behavior is not going to be tolerated.'\"\n \n \"Tolerated.\" Now there's a word Republicans should meditate on for a long moment.\n \n When I was covering Capitol Hill just before Clinton's impeachment, every other young, spiffily manicured male staffer I met in Republican Congressional offices was at least androcentric, if not obviously gay. I don't have a sensitive gay-dar, but there was something about them. Ties never askew, hair immaculately groomed, cuffs gleaming, they usually knew more about my shoes than I did.\n \n Bill Clinton's voracious heterosexuality had as much to do with drawing their rabid hatred as any of his other attributes. He loved women too much, and if only he'd given equal time and effort to seducing those beautiful men, he might have saved himself some trouble.\n \n Republicans in Washington know there are probably more gay men in their ranks than there are on Castro Street.\n \n Still, against all logic and sense, they won't utter a word about tolerance.\n \n It's time for Republicans to embrace their own gay wing and stop fueling the sickness of suppression that drives men like Larry Craig into airport bathroom stalls. Until they do, they're headed straight for the toilet with him -- not that they shouldn't jump right in anyway.",

   "The only kind of \"morality\" that this movement knows or embraces is politically exploitative, cost-free morality. That is why the national Republican Party rails endlessly against homosexuality and is virtually mute about divorce and adultery: because anti-gay moralism costs virtually all of its supporters nothing (since that is a moral prohibition that does not constrain them), while heterosexual moral deviations -- from divorce to adultery to sex outside of marriage -- are rampant among the Values Voters faithful and thus removed from the realm of condemnation. Hence we have scads of people sitting around opposing same-sex marriage because of their professed belief in \"Traditional Marriage\" while their \"third husbands\" and multiple step-children and live-in girlfriends sit next to them on the couch.\n \n ... It goes without saying that no gay candidate would stand a chance of receiving the presidential nomination from the party that stands for Traditional Marriage.

   "Sen. Larry Craig's arrest shows that 'Tearoom Trade' is alive and well despite the progress of gay rights.\n \n By David Ehrenstein \n August 30, 2007 LA Times\n \n Gentle reader, by now you've probably read more than you ever nightmared you'd want to know about the latest Republican gay-sex scandal. The revelation that Idaho Sen. Larry Craig was caught allegedly trolling for sex in a Minnesota airport men's room in June comes on the heels of Florida state Rep. Robert Allen's July restroom arrest, making it reasonable to suspect that yet another GOP bathroom bust may burst forth by the time this Op-Ed article goes to press.\n \n But barring further white-tiled tragedy, the all-too-obvious question remains, \"What in the Sam Hill is going on here?\" The answer rests on what can safely be described as bipartisan grounds.\n \n To get there, let's climb into the Wayback Machine and return to Oct. 7, 1964. That's when Walter Jenkins, one of the most senior aides in President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration, was arrested for soliciting sex in the men's room of a Washington YMCA. Being that it was three weeks before the election, LBJ suspected some kind of Republican foul play, but the GOP chose not to exploit the incident.\n \n The Jenkins affair put \"homosexuality\" on the nation's front pages in a way it hadn't been since Dr. Alfred Kinsey's famous report in 1948.\n \n Like Craig, Jenkins could well have said he \"wasn't gay.\" But who was in 1964? Then as now, if you were wealthy and well-connected, you could enjoy what's contemporarily referred to as a \"gay lifestyle\" with some ease -- and a soup\u00e7on of caution. For those less well-off, danger lurked. Sodomy laws were on the books. Bars and clubs catering to the same-sex-oriented were \"speakeasy\" affairs often run by Mafiosi who bribed the police to stay open. When the money didn't arrive on time or in insufficient quantity, such clubs were raided.\n \n On June 28, 1969, when New York's far-from-fashionable Stonewall Inn was raided, the patrons responded by fighting the cops. Although gays and lesbians had resisted before (often right here in Los Angeles), this Manhattan uprising served to jump-start the modern phase of the gay rights movement.\n \n That movement, with its defiant insistence on being free to be as gay as all-get-out, quickly left the likes of Walter Jenkins and, if the cops were right, Larry Craig in the dust. They're part of a subculture within a subculture that was memorably identified by the daring sociologist Laud Humphreys in a landmark sociological study titled \"Tearoom Trade.\"\n \n Taking his cue from Kinsey, Humphreys was fascinated with married-with-children men who didn't self-identify as gay or bisexual, yet still sought clandestine sex with other men on the side. Humphreys, when he began his research, was one of these I'm-not-gay(s) himself, though he eventually came out.\n \n Published in 1970, \"Tearoom Trade\" is full of useful information about foot tapping, shoe touching, hand signaling and all the other rituals those so inclined use to make contact with one another in such places. Clearly no media outlet should be without a copy -- especially Slate.com, whose editors revealed their cluelessness on the subject this week in a \"real time conversation\" rife with unintentional hilarity: \"I can't believe it's a crime to tap your foot.\" \"Can someone explain the mechanics of how two people are supposed to commit a sex act in a stall where legs are visible from the knee down?\"\n \n As for the less blinkered among us, in the age of Ellen DeGeneres, Neil Patrick Harris, \"Brokeback Mountain\" and the smooching gay teens on \"As the World Turns,\" bathroom cruisers seem almost antique. Today's gays want to get married, and an airport men's room is no place to propose.\n \n Moreover, if what you're \"proposing\" falls well short of marriage, there's always the Internet. Larry Craig, meet Craigslist. In short, never has the admonition \"Get a room!\" seemed more apropos. It's up to the I'm-not-gay(s) to discover the real freedoms fought for and won by the people they so fiercely claim they're not.",

The New York Times reported that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell forced Larry Craig's resignation by threatening Craig with a sensational, televised, McCarthyesque ethics investigation that could bring forth Craig's history of prior male-on-male sexual activities and force him to answer to all the lurid details.\n \n The Republicans were fretting big time about their homo-hating base -- it's really all they've got left -- and they would do whatever it took to banish Craig, including bludgeoning him into submission with threats of further exposure. The Idaho senator may have pleaded guilty to a crime but his was a minor infraction --compared to the sleazy business of other Republican senators, including Alaska's Ted Stevens, whose home was raided by the FBI and IRS in the midst of an investigation of official favors he may have done for an oil company -- and Craig paid for his crime (with a fine).\n \n [...]\n \n If the Republican Party has no choice but to tell its base that purging the XXXXX members of Congress is the way to go, well then, there seem to be a few more Republican senators and house members that must be banished. It is now even more relevant for the traditional media to report on these alleged closet cases, considering how the party leadership has treated Larry Craig.\n\n \n Signorile goes on to speculate about several other GOP members of Congress whose sexual orientation has been the topic of speculation. If the GOP intends to scapegoat gay Americans as the source of all evil, they do need to come clean about the homos in their own midst who have subscribed to this vicious strategy.\n \n The notion of outing vs. reporting is probably one that deserves its own thread.",

If someone wants to have sex in a public place they should be allowed to. If it gets distracting or becomes a nuience they should be asked to stop, much the same with cell phones.",

   "All Muck is Local: Blank Check to Coy's Mistress Brings Trouble\n By Will Thomas - September 2, 2007, 10:13 AM\n \n Make room Craig, Vitter and Bob. Coy Privette (R-NC) wants to join the summer of scandal!\n \n Privette, a 74-year old retired pastor, has pleaded guilty to six counts of soliciting a prostitute. Privette is a long-time participant in North Carolina politics, spending eight years in the state house and another nine as a commissioner of Cabarrus County. He is a staunch social conservative and, until recently, President of the Christian Action League.\n \n The trouble started for Privette back in May, when an unnamed woman cashed a blank check with his signature on it. The woman had a second check, already written out for $4,000. She explained that the checks weren't given to her, but to a friend who had asked her to cash them. Privette was alerted of the possible forgery; he said he had indeed lost the two checks and the bank refunded his money. Case closed.\n \n Well, not for the police. They traced the checks back to one Tiffany Summers. But on July 19th, a court indicted both Summers and Privette. Apparently, he had paid her for services at least six times over as many months. Privette immediately stepped down from his Christian advocacy group; he later pleaded guilty on August 22nd. The judge has agreed to expunge his record upon completing 48 hours of community service, saying he's only concerned with \"making sure the behavior stopped.\"",

   "Well, I can't say I'm sorry to see that Craig will not go down without a fight. He's a crusty old hypocrite and I've little sympathy for him, but the more trouble he can cause for the puritanical thought police who think that entrapment of gay people into public sex is a worthy endeavour, the better pleased i am. Who knows, Craig might even redeem himself, though I'm not optimistic about that, and any trouble he makes for the GOP is just icing on the cake. :)\n \n Craig's case also brings into the spotlight the hypocrisy of the GOP: it gives a senator like Vitter a free pass for breaking sex laws because his governor is a Democrat and the GOP would lose a senate seat. The GOP were happy to throw Craig to the wolves because his lawbreaking was homosexual, red meat to the party of so-called \"family values\", and because his governor is a Republican making his seat safe for the GOP.\n \n All i can do is sit back and enjoy the ensuing fracas. :)",

   "The Craig conundrum has exposed an Achilles heel that has long been present in the GOP - conservative organizations, such as the American Family Association, have removed the human element from homosexuality and replaced it with a man-made element driven by fear of the \"homosexual agenda.\" Homosexuals, therefore, are not just average citizens; they are threats to the moral order and must be opposed at all costs.\n To some of the leadership of the Christian right, the homosexual agenda is a zero-sum game where Christians lose if gays win. There is no middle ground; there is no room for compromise.\n Homosexuality, thus, has become the ultimate of sins that can be committed against the GOP establishment, and its punishment must be quick and severe, lest one is seen giving aid to the enemy. When it is unearthed that a homosexual is within the ranks of GOP leadership, they must be shown the exit immediately.\n The fact that the alleged homosexual may be a God-fearing Christian struggling with his sexual identity is irrelevant. Christian compassion stops at the Castro District.\n If you are caught fraternizing with the D.C. Madame, we got your back. Plead no contest to a DUI charge? Don't sweat it; we're all human. Have a home raided on charges of corruption? We've all been there. But get caught in a Minneapolis men's room sting, and you receive a one-way ticket to the gallows.\n There is, however, a bit of irony. In their zeal to portray homosexuals as public enemy No. 1, some right-wing activists have created a catch-22 that leaves no room for error. As demonstrated in the past, not many people can live up to such a standard.\n Because the issue of homosexuality has been blown out of proportion by a handful of fundraising fanatics, the recent Craig incident has distracted America from the real issues.\n \n http://www.thebulletin.us/site/news.cfm?newsid=18792552&BRD=2737&PAG=461&dept_id=576361&rfi=6",
