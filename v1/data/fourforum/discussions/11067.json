   "Here is another reason why him disavowing Wrights views wont work and rings so hollow for so many.

Obama can't claim to trust Wright so much yet deny he knew or knows precisely what Wright believes in life. It is impossible that Obama wouldn't know that Wright went to meet Mo'amar Quadafi with Louis Farrakan, or that his church gave Farrakan a life time achievement award. The very assertion that he was unaware of such events, or the radical beliefs this reverend promoted is an insult to the intelligence of all Americans.\n \n My most serious question as a Christian is, what is any so called christian pastor doing endorsing an anti Jewish racist like Farrakan, who also denies Christ and worships Allah, the god of islam? How do those two belief systems mesh at all, in any way? I only ask because I know they don't mesh at all. This is further evidence for me that Obama isn't a believer in Christ at all, but is a closet muslim who holds views closer to farrakan's racist islamic perspective than traditional christian values that he claims to represent.

He is either a liar OR he lacks judgment. He claims to never have suspected that the Rev. Wright believed the things he was saying on the tapes. Now, if that's true, it means for 20 years someone has been fooling him about who and what they are--that totally calls into question his judgment. On the other hand if that's not true it means that he's lying, that he DID know the Rev. felt this way. Either way Hillary's gonna have a field day!\n \n Now, for a campaign that's all about Hope and Message, Obama can't go out and claim that what you say doesn't mean anything.

The only thing anyone can come up with in arguing he's a Muslim is that his father was Muslim. Sorry, that just doesn't cut it.\n\n \n Here is where semantics get in the way of being clearly understood. I don't for a minute believe that the American Black Muslim movement is like true Islamism, or as it used to be referred to; Mohammedanism. They are very different in their precepts. The black muslim movement in America is unique in that it is meant to empower blacks in a perceived predominantly white American Society. More Black Muslims are recruited out of the American prison System than from any other sector of American Society.\n \n For Rev. Wright to have so endorsed and embraced a known racist like Louis Farrakan just screams of a hidden agenda that doesn't necessarily mean his church is black muslim, but it also means that he isn't representing Christ either. So that means we must ask ourselves why an allegedly christian church would embrace a known anti jewish racist? After all, salvation came to the World by way of the jew, so how could people who claim to be christians, hate the people through which our salvation came? \n \n It's understandable how black muslims could claim to hate jews, being a type of islamic offshoot, no matter how thinly veiled, but how does a Christian church embrace such a philosophy if they are truly committed Christians who really believe that Jesus is the Messiah? It just doesn't add up. \n \n So I'm not saying that Obamma is a closet black muslim as much as I'm saying he doesn't add up to a true believer in Christ at all. He is most likely a militant and angry black man because no one will ever convince me that after 20 years as a member of that church that he wasn't fully aware of Wrights embracing of Farrakan, and that includes Wrights trip to meet Quaddafi with him. \n \n There is no way that Obama could have remained in such radical, militant, anti-american, and extremist company as a politician with hopes for the Whitehouse someday unless he agreed with and accepted what was being represented by these men, in his heart.",

   "I knew this was going to happen. They've found that he was there at one of the sermons. Uh Oh! He's got some 'splaining to do!\n \n \n \n \n Obama Attended Hate America Sermon \n \n Sunday, March 16, 2008 7:14 PM\n \n By: Ronald Kessler Article Font Size \n \n \n \n \n Obama claims he was completely unaware that the Reverend Wright's trademark preaching style at the Trinity United Church of Christ targeted \"white\" America. \n \n Contrary to Senator Barack Obama's claim that he never heard his pastor Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr. preach hatred of America, Obama was in the pews last July 22 when the minister blamed the \"white arrogance\" of America's Caucasian majority for the world's suffering, especially the oppression of blacks. \n \n \n Senator Obama has sought to separate himself from his pastor's incendiary remarks, issuing a statement Friday rejecting them as \"inflammatory and appalling\" but failing to renounce Wright himself for his venomous and paranoid denunciations of America. \n \n \n In his press release, Obama claimed, \"The statements that Rev. Wright made that are the cause of this controversy were not statements I personally heard him preach while I sat in the pews of Trinity [United Church of Christ] or heard him utter in private conversation.\" \n \n \n Appearing on cable news shows this past weekend, Obama claimed when he saw recent videos that have Wright making such comments as \"God damn America,\" he was \"shocked.\" Obama implied that the reverend had not used such derogatory language in any of the church services Obama attended over the past two decades. \n \n \n If Obama's claims are true that he was completely unaware that Wright's trademark preaching style at the Trinity United Church of Christ has targeted \"white\" America and Israel, he would have been one of the few people in Chicago to be so uninformed. Wright's reputation for spewing hate is well known. \n \n \n In fact, Obama was present in the South Side Chicago church on July 22 last year when Jim Davis, a freelance correspondent for Newsmax, attended services along with Obama. [See: \"Obama's Church: Cauldron of Division.\"] \n \n \n In his sermon that day, Wright tore into America, referring to the \"United States of White America\" and lacing his sermon with expletives as Obama listened. Hearing Wright's attacks on his own country, Obama had the opportunity to walk out, but Davis said the senator sat in his pew and nodded in agreement. \n \n \n Addressing the Iraq war, Wright thundered, \"Young African-American men\" were \"dying for nothing.\" The \"illegal war,\" he shouted, was \"based on Bush's lies\" and is being \"fought for oil money.\" \n \n \n \n Obama's most famous celebrity backer, Oprah Winfrey began attending Wright's church in 1984. Last year, Newsmax magazine reported that Winfrey abruptly stopped attending years ago, and suggested that she did so to distance herself from Wright's inflammatory rhetoric. She soon found herself a target of Wright, who excoriated her for having broken with \"traditional faith.\" \n \n \n The Reverend Wright's anti-white theology that Senator Obama expressed surprise over is evident on the church's website. The site says the congregation subscribes to what it calls the Black Value System, which is described as a disavowal of \"our racist competitive society\" and the pursuit of \"middle-classness.\" That is defined as a way for American society to \"snare\" blacks rather than \"killing them off directly\" or \"placing them in concentration camps,\" just as the country structures \"an economic environment that induces captive youth to fill the jails and prisons.\" \n \n \n \"In the 21st century, white America got a wake-up call after 9/11/01,\" Wright wrote in the church-affiliated magazine Trumpet four years after the attacks. \"White America and the western world came to realize that people of color had not gone away, faded into the woodwork or just 'disappeared' as the Great White West kept on its merry way of ignoring black concerns.\" \n \n \n \n The Relationship Unravels \n \n \n Senator Obama now is attempting to minimize his long and close relationship with the controversial minister. \n \n On Friday, John McCain's campaign distributed a Wall Street Journal op-ed \"Obama and the Minister\" written under my byline based on my reporting for Newsmax going back to early January of this year. \n \n \n The op-ed included details of a sermon Wright gave at Howard University blaming America for starting the AIDS virus, training professional killers, importing drugs, shamelessly supporting Israel, and creating a racist society that would never elect a black man as president. [See: \"Obama's Minister's Hatred of America.\"] \n \n \n Obama's campaign quickly responded to the Wall Street Journal op-ed, posting a statement on the Huffington Post. In his statement, Obama acknowledged that some of Wright's statements have been \"inflammatory and appalling.\" \n \n \n Saying he strongly condemns Wright's comments, Obama continued, \"I categorically denounce any statement that disparages our great country or serves to divide us from our allies. I also believe that words that degrade individuals have no place in our public dialogue, whether it's on the campaign stump or in the pulpit. In sum, I reject outright the statements by Rev. Wright that are at issue.\" [emphasis added] \n \n \n Again, Obama moved to narrowly distance himself from specific comments Wright had made, while still praising his minister in recent interviews for leading him to Jesus and preaching a \"social gospel.\" \n \n \n Obama went on to claim that he first learned about Wright's controversial statements when he began his presidential campaign. But this assertion conflicts with the fact that just before Obama's nationally televised campaign kickoff rally on Feb. 10, 2007, the candidate disinvited Wright from giving the public invocation. \n \n \n At the time, Wright explained: \"When [Obama's] enemies find out that in 1984 I went to Tripoli\" to visit Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, \"a lot of his Jewish support will dry up quicker than a snowball in hell.\" \n \n \n According to Wright, Obama then told him, \"'You can get kind of rough in the sermons, so what we've decided is that it's best for you not to be out there in public.'\" Still, Obama and his family prayed privately with Wright just before the presidential announcement. \n \n \n Apparently Obama never foresaw Wright's sermons making national television or becoming a sensation on YouTube. But lending graphic detail to the saga, ABC News and other networks began running a 2003 sermon in which Wright said, \"The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing 'God Bless America.' No, no, no, God damn America, that's in the Bible, for killing innocent people ... God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America for as long as she acts like she is God and she is supreme.\" [Click Here to see video] \n \n \n Obama has described Wright as a sounding board and mentor. Wright is one of the first people Obama thanked after his election to the Senate in 2004. Obama consulted Wright before deciding to run for president. The title of Obama's bestseller \"The Audacity of Hope\" comes from one of Wright's sermons. Obama's \"Yes We Can!\" slogan is one of Wright's exhortations. \n \n \n Apologists for Wright have said that what he says is normal in black churches, and many blacks claim such preaching cannot be understood by whites. \n \n \n \"If you're black, it's hard to say what you truly think and not upset white people,\" the New York Times quoted James Cone as saying. Cone is a professor at Union Theological Seminary and the father of what is known as black liberation theology. \n \n \n But Juan Williams, a Fox News commentator and author of \"Enough: The Phony Leaders, Dead-End Movements, and Culture of Failure That Are Undermining Black America,\" tells Newsmax that Wright's sermons reflect \"the victim mindset that is so self-defeating in the black community and one that is played on by weak black leadership that chooses to have black people identified as victims rather than inspiring them as people who have overcome. In posing as victims, they say the most prejudiced and vicious things, not only about whites but about America. They call it theology. In fact, it's nothing but bigotry.\" \n \n \n In failing to condemn Wright himself and claiming that he was unaware of the preacher's hate-filled speech, Obama is continuing a longstanding pattern. \n \n \n Obama often refers to Wright as being \"like an old uncle, who sometimes says things I don't agree with.\" Wright is not Obama's \"uncle\" - a person born into a blood relationship - but a man he has cultivated for decades as a close friend, mentor and adviser. \n \n \n After Newsmax broke the story on Jan. 14 that Wright's church gave an award to Louis Farrakhan in December for lifetime achievement, Obama again sought to denounce his minister's action without criticizing Wright himself. \n \n \n Like Wright, Farrakhan has repeatedly made hate-filled statements targeting Jews (calling Judaism a \"gutter religion\"), whites, and America. He has called whites \"blue-eyed devils\" and the \"anti-Christ.\" He has described Jews as \"bloodsuckers\" who control the government, the media, and some black organizations. \n \n \n After the Newsmax story, Obama issued a statement purportedly addressing the issue. \n \n \n \"I decry racism and anti-Semitism in every form and strongly condemn the anti-Semitic statements made by Minister Farrakhan,\" Obama said. \n \n \n Again, Obama was careful not to condemn Farrakhan himself or Wright who had spoken adoringly of Farrakhan and put their church behind the award to the controversial Nation of Islam leader. \n \n \n \"When Minister Farrakhan speaks, black America listens,\" Trumpet quoted Wright as saying. \"His depth on analysis [sic] when it comes to the racial ills of this nation is astounding and eye-opening. He brings a perspective that is helpful and honest.\" \n \n \n Obama adroitly said, \"I assume that Trumpet magazine made its own decision to honor Farrakhan based on his efforts to rehabilitate ex-offenders, but it is not a decision with which I agree.\" \n \n \n In fact, Trumpet is published by Wright's church using the church's offices. Wright's daughters serve as publisher and executive editor. \n \n \n Having gotten away with sidestepping Wright's adoring comments about Farrakhan, Obama told Jewish leaders flatly in Cleveland on Jan. 24 that the award was because of Farrakhan's work with ex-offenders. To date, no news outlet has pointed out that Obama's claim is false. \n \n \n Obama went on to explain away Wright's anti-Zionist statements as being rooted in his anger over the Jewish state's support for South Africa under its previous policy of apartheid. As with his claim that the award to Farrakhan was made because of his work with ex-offenders, Obama made that up. Wright's statements denouncing Israel have not been qualified in any way. \n \n \n On Fox News' Hannity & Colmes on Friday, Obama said he would have quit the church if he had \"repeatedly\" been present when Wright made inflammatory statements. He was not asked why he did not quit the church when it gave an award to Farrakhan. \n \n \n Having considered Wright a friend and mentor for two decades, Obama now often mentions that his pastor recently retired. Wright suggested to the New York Times last year that he and Obama might have to do something of a distancing act in the run up to the election. \n \n \n \"If Barack gets past the primary, he might have to publicly distance himself from me,\" Wright was quoted by The New York Times. \"I said it to Barack personally, and he said, 'Yeah, that might have to happen.'\"",

I posted a link that said this in my post above.\n Prophet Jesus ('Isa)\n Muslims believe that Jesus, son of Mary, was a noble and honorable prophet of God. Learn more about the life and teachings of Jesus, according to the Muslim faith.\n I'm telling you straight out that I was personally taught that Jesus Christ was a prophet. In fact, when someone ever referred to Him as the son of God when I was a kid, my dad would get upset as he believed the very claim was blasphemous; because as you may know, moslems also believe that GOD IS ONE AND MOHAMMED IS HIS PROPHET. Which kind of explains why they insist that Jesus is just a MAN/Prophet and not a Savior/Messiah in any way. \n \n Here's more on Jesus:\n A. In the Qur'an, stories about the life and teachings of Jesus Christ (called 'Isa in Arabic) are abundant. The Qur'an recalls his miraculous birth, his teachings, the miracles he performed by God's permission, and his life as a respected prophet of God. The Qur'an also repeatedly reminds that Jesus was a human prophet sent by God, not part of God Himself.

And your point about which voters are even interested in this is very relevant indeed. For example, on saturday, 3 days after Rev. Wrights story hit the National News, Iowa committed Edwards Super Delegates and Obama won that contest and picked up more than Hillary did. \n \n The important message in that is that to democrats. especially the liberal ones, Wright's extreme opinions don't even bother them. In fact they agree with him so this could actually help Obama in the remaining DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY CONTESTS. Only in the general election will the Independents, conservative and moderate democrats, and republicans add up to enough votes to soundly defeat what he represents.\n \n After all, it has already been shown that he has the most liberal voting record in the Senate, even more liberal than Hillary. I truly hope that Obama wins the Primaries and defeats Hillary as he'll be easier to beat in the end because of all of these issues combined along with his general lack of experience in Washington Politics and International affairs.",

   "Thank you for your interest in Trinity United Church of Christ and for your consideration of our member, Sen. Barack Obama, in the Democratic primary election. Due to the high volume of emails and inquiries, we are unable to respond to each one personally. We were overwhelmed with \"hits\" after Senator Obama's historic victory in the Iowa democratic caucus.\n Barack Obama has been a member of Trinity United Church of Christ for nearly two decades. As a young community organizer, new to Chicago, Barack met with Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., Trinity's Senior Pastor, seeking advice. He received good counsel about the complexities of life in Chicago and the challenges faced by residents in poor communities like South Chicago's Altgeld Gardens.\n The United Church of Christ (http://www.ucc.org), Trinity's denominational affiliation, is \"a community of faith that seeks to respond to the Gospel of Jesus Christ in word and deed.\" It was founded in 1957 through the union of several different Christian traditions. Not only does Trinity not exclude anyone from membership or attendance based on race or ethnicity, but:\n The majority of UCC members are white; the conference minister of the Illinois Conference of the UCC (Rev. Jane Fisler Hoffman) and her husband (both white) are members of Trinity (You can watch a video of Rev. Hoffman speaking at Trinity about her positive experiences there.); Trinity has been instrumental in working with and lending financial and staff support to the development of new UCC churches in Gary, IN (with the Indiana-Kentucky Conference of the UCC, Milwaukee, WI (with the Wisconsin Conference of the UCC), and Benton Harbor, MI (with the Michigan Conference of the UCC). There is no anti-American sentiment in the theology or the practice of Trinity United Church of Christ. To be sure, there is prophetic preaching against oppression, racism and other evils that would deny the American ideal. Trinity is \"Unashamedly Black and Unapologetically Christian.\"\n Trinity was founded in 1961 and had 87 families when Dr. Wright started his tenure in 1972. Currently, as Dr. Wright anticipates a 2008 retirement, there are more than 8,000 members, 70 ministries, and three Sunday worship services. You and your family can watch these services online at 7:30am, 11:00am and 6:00pm CST.\n If you require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact Senator Obama's office:\n Devorah Adler at dadler@barackobama.com Joshua DuBois at jdubois@barackobama.com\n Yours in Christ!",

In fact the UN has the well deserved reputation of creating more genocide's than political fixes in the Countries they have sought to aid in times of crisis.

The middle East is still steeped in poverty for the masses while just a few families rule with an iron fist. Much of Asia is still ruled by either communist or totalitarian regimes. South and Central America are still steeped in many of the Third World problems that existed a half century ago as poverty runs rampant with weak economies and political instability everywhere.\n \n Of course there are exceptions on these Continents but with a World that has created so many trillions of dollars of new wealth over the last 50 years, and with the Creation of the UN in 1948 by the first World Countries for just the purpose of creating opportunities and wealth in the undeveloped Countries. But has that happened? Not at all. None of it. In fact the UN has the well deserved reputation of creating more genocide's than political fixes in the Countries they have sought to aid in times of crisis. And the cause of all of this same ole same ole can be summed up in one word; GREED. And that is my rant for this evening. emoticon_xagree\n\n \n \n I've never bought into the tri lateral commission personally. I think if there was the would wouldn't be so chaotic (not that I'd like some invisible hand controlling everything). I think there are too many divergent interests for something like that to take hold. Don't get me wrong, I know that the rich and powerful do have pull but just as often they pull against each other and balance out. The problem with a lot of the aid is that it just gets gobbled up by those who are in power in these country and they use it to entrench themselves further.",

I asked for the source of these quotes, as a quick search of bible gateway reveals they are from multiple versions of the bible (my guess-he's copied and pasted them from anti-gay websites and does not himself know what version of the bible each is from), and refuses to answer my original question.\n \n The trouble is, this is the exact same thing that occurs every time AA enters a discussion.\n \n If the admin would like to move mine and AA's preceding posts to this thread, the last one AA bailed on when he refused to answer me, that would be fine with me.\n \n If not, don't worry, he'll stop posting in the thread right away",

   "Why do you not ever answer a simple question archangel? What about my questions has you confused?\n \n You do realize how foolish you look when you can't answer two simple questions, don't you? If you will answer these two simple questions, then I'll address whatever you want, but until you address questions I posted four times now, why should I respond to any of yours?\n \n Again, (fourth time):\n \n What version is each of these verses from?\n\n \n You can ask me 400 times to jump through your infantile hoops but that doesn't mean I feel obligated to. Look the versions up yourself if you want to. I posted the verses and cited their placement in the bible; you're free to research which versions they come from if you want to.\n \n \nOh, and your \"answer\" above doesn't cut it, as you yourself said:\n \"It was the Age of the Law and those Laws were created for the Jewish people to observe so they would remain separate from the Gentiles who surrounded them. So asking why the Jews no longer practice them might be relevant, but that has nothing to do with Christians who live according to New Testament Principles in this Age of Grace.\", from this post\n I asked you previously for clarification, right here in fact:\n \n So again, I ask you:\n The guy who is God incarnate comes down, says \"forget all those old rules, they don't apply anymore. This is what you need to do:...\"\n and yet he made no mention of homosexuality...\n Strange, don't you think?\n\n \n My answer above cuts it just fine regarding this debate. And you are doing the exact same song and dance that you did in the thread you're quoting from. You are expert at twisting and corrupting what i say so that by the time were done, even i can't follow the debate. Twist away tq, but twist alone as I have made my point with these verses I posted that give Gods own opinion of what homosexuality represents; and all of your senseless minutia that is meant to dilute that message is nothing but bait and switch tactics and I'm not playing them. But notice that these are Old and New Testament verses so your attempt to use the Old against the New fails miserably. You've also conveniently ignored that there are 2 OT Passages condemning homosexuality, but twice as many in the NT.\n Leviticus 18:22 - You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.\n \n Leviticus 20:13 - If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them.\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.\n \n I Corinthians 6:9 - Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\n \n I Timothy 1:8-11 - \"But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully, realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching, according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.\"\n \n Jude 1:6-7 - And angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day, just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.\n Sorry fishbulb; I was replying when you wrote your post.

It seems like this thread has gone a bit off topic, so maybe this will help things get back on track.\n \n CUNxTime, if you copy and paste news articles you should include a link to the source. If you had, some might have noticed sooner that this article appeared on Newsmax, and has been shown to be incorrect. Obama was not at that sermon like the article claims.

They made such a big deal about that, but with Obama, its no problem, just out of context stuff from a guy that Obama isn't responsible for--lol.\n\n \n I haven't heard all the statements made by Obama's minister, but I actually agree with the position that his 20 years of preaching sheds a better light on his views. I hold the same position as to Ferraro's statements. She, too, has a long career that was completely discounted, along with anything she had to say about what she meant. Though I don't think Obama's minister even apologized or made any attempt to discuss himself. (Or if so, that wasn't publicized much.)\n \n My biggest gripe with what he said, though, had to do with Hillary Clinton. He just attacked her again and again in a manner that I could not see as anything except offensive and hateful. Though it also shed light, for me, on how high the stakes in this election feel for some. How carried away people have become on one side or another.\n \n However, I also think a preacher and his flock get to know one another, and he may say things in a context that makes sense in another respect to that audience. Though why he chose this particular moment in a presidential campaign is beyond me. Perhaps he had some unconscious thing about sabotaging Obama. Obama was defying the teacher and going beyond. Or perhaps, he just lost himself with the intensity of it all. It became too important to him for Obama to win, at any cost.\n \n Most of my objection to Obama, though, has not been the candidate himself-- but many of his followers -- and has actually not come from the behavior of -- say, this minister (who I would seperate from Obama) -- but his white supporters and their continuous exploitation of Republican birthed anti-Hillary hatred. And assurance that they can get away with it. Their obliviousness to what the Clinton campaign means to others -- except for their own arrogant projections there. That has been my experience. And, this is somewhat different, to me, than anti-Hillary talk from Republican supporters. Who are, IMV, coming from a different place. Even if I disagree. \n \n Anyway, eventually, my experiences with those supporters - even if it's just reading their anti-Hillary rants weekly or daily -- became my experience of the candidate. They seem to have more to say about that, than their candidate, Obama.\n \n With Clinton, it has ever been the experience of the candidate herself. Not the supporters, who are overall much more low-key. And, their campaign has not been a primarily anti-Obama campaign. It's been very issues focused, very supportive of the Democratic party winning. At least, for most of it. And my sense is that Clinton has worked hard to try to keep it that way. Despite the side-trips for them, as well.\n \n Today, however, I had an interesting encounter with another kind of Obama supporter. Not like the ones who were dished for a position in the Clinton administration, have their political grudges, are doing the frat number with the rest of the campus cattle, or have their unresolved Paglia mother issues with another generation of the women's movement, are getting a pass on the health care, fall in with some Princeton student adulation of Obama's wife, or are ready to irrationally seek out and destroy any opposition under the guise of reason, and have lived such lives of liberal privilege, that they need to feel better about themselves, and, part of that entails feeling entitled to violate others' rights in the name of civil rights. Oh yeah, the power of the fist. Only it's white, isn't it. And they know best what everyone else needs. Being who they are.\n \n Well, it is those other, quieter, voices that will convince me in Nov. if Obama wins the nomination. Not that list which I am so tired of reading, from internet forums (not this one) to NY Times Dowd to the rest who know well who they are, day after day after day with anti-Hillary talk.\n \n I hope they well remember how much effort they put into dishing the first major woman Presidential candidate (and likely the last, even in my lifetime) -- and, a Democrat -- with a long history of working in Civil Rights, on women's and family issues, in health care, gave a major speech in China -- and, whatever her vote -- which was the same as KERRY (who many of them supported and never dished, as he supported Obama) -- committed to getting us out of Iraq, getting universal health care, and salvaging the economic devastation wrought by the Bush administration.\n \n While they narry said a word this whole time about them.\n \n I will remember the rest of my life what they did during this campaign. After two administrations of George Bush and Dick Cheney (the real damners of America, and the entire planet, too), the oil bandits in the White House who have raped this nation and destroyed two others, put us on the brink, at one point, of a 3rd World War. Their hatred of Hillary Clinton, instead, and how they finished the Democratic candidacy for president for any candidate. The first woman or the first African American. With their liberal progressive white American arrogant intellectual stupidity. I will also remember the ones who oft wore their principles and courage on their breasts, but never said a word when they knew exactly what it was about. Were complicit in the same kind of silence they often condemned across time and sea. (For evil is never eating at our own table, sleeping in our own beds.)\n \n If the quieter voices don't reach me enough (for the list will likely keep blabbing loudly instead), well, then Unreasonable Nader. He will get more votes, anyway, from both Republicans and Democrats, this time around, IMO. Think NAFTA. Think globalization. Americans are increasingly sick of it. And don't see change on the horizon with either Dems or Pubs, or much differences between either. The peanuts they are still throwing aren't worth it. \n \n But John McCain, I won't support. Like each of three candidates, he has some admirable personal qualities, but just for starters, he's pro-Iraq, pro big corporate power (I know, the Dems aren't much better there), and, anti-Roe V Wade (which I think has broader implications than \"only\" abortion).\n \n I am an obstinate, however. If anyone (like, from that list) tells me I have to vote for Obama or it's ... Darth Vader, again -- AFAIC, they have only themselves to blame for that. \n \n It probably will be Darth Vader. But I am not that certain it's because of Obama's minister, at this point.\n \n Think of this post as the law of karma, which I personally have not yet transcended.\n emoticon_cool",

   "On a literal level, the statement is true. But the speech, with its focus on Hillary Clinton as an implied metaphorical example of all that is wrong in American society for African Americans, was a horrific form of rhetoric -- involving scapegoating and sexism, among other monsters rearing their heads. Though there are elements of liberation theology, elements of what is more common to some churches, the minister's so-called identity as a liberation theologian is also a smokescreen, to some extent, IMO. Especially given that this speech was made during the height of a presidential election, and, that he is trained in the many uses of rhetoric ... responsible and irresponsible use .. in some ways, he sounded quite, well, fascistic-like, to me. (Yes, that's the f word, but I use it quite intentionally, with its meaning well in mind.)\n \n I will also add, that I differ with that minister as to whether or not Hillary Clinton has ever been (figuratively speaking) called the \"n\" word. There are many, many ways to call women the n word. And Hillary Clinton, if anything, is one of the most remarkable American politicians in our nation's history for her ability, over the years, to have walked through mine field after mine field of n words being hurled at her, yet never losing her composure or lowering her head.\n \n I thank the left for showing me, during this campaign, just how sickeningly sexist they really are. Every time they went out for their daily or weekly tirades on Hillary, and, every time, they didn't, but turned their heads. While strutting about touting lip service to their fine ideals.\n \n IMO, the Obama campaign is unique is its blatant obscuration of women's issues such as these. Yes, his speech on race was excellent. But, it was not without it flaws -- one of which included his total summation of women's issues in America as \"the white woman trying to break the glass ceiling.\"\n \n Obama wants people to think this is the summation of women's issues in America.\n \n But what I think is, that is a summation of most of what he understands in that respect. Not very deep at all. Far surpassed there, intellectually, by Senator Clinton. And, over 1/2 this country and over 1/2 this planet are women.\n \n I think Obama's minister, and, Obama, should listen to this song.

I heard a guy today on one of the call in shows say that to know if it was racist or not we'd have to listen to his entire 20 years of preaching! What tripe!\n\n \n Well, I'm not sure who \"they\" are, but I wouldn't say short snippets from a long sermon are \"invalid\" per se. Certainly they deserve scrutiny. From what I've heard, the call to examine context means to look at why Rev. Wright said these things, and also to examine the greater scope of the actions of the man and the members of his church in a broader sense.\n \n As Obama indicated in his speech, Wright harbors a deep seated resentment. Such resentment seems to have bred a great deal of contempt and mistrust, as evidenced by his apparent advancing of certain conspiracy theories (that AIDS was created by the government). As someone who likely came of age during a turbulent time in the civil rights movement and during the time of the Tuskegee Experiment; and also noting other possible examples of  biological tactics against other ethnic groups in North America, it is possible to understand why such resentment might arise. Here's a similar example: mistrust of the Bush administration and its foreign policy decisions has, at least in part, contributed to some of the despicable conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11.\n \n Does Wright's resentment excuse his words? Certainly not, but it raises the point that it is important to distinguish between Wright and Obama, who are of different generations and have accumulated completely different life experiences.\n \n This of course does not answer the question most people have been asking, that \"if Obama disagrees with Wright, why did he stay with the church?\" I don't know the exact answer, or even if there is an exact answer, other than the fact that human relationships are far more complex than cable news would have us believe. As evidenced in his speech, I don't think it would be possible for him to be a part of most churches in the black community without later being associated with some of the deep resentment harbored by large parts of the older generation, even if he himself does not feel that way.\n \n \nAlso, I haven't heard much from the people who were screaming about Hagee endorsing McCain. They went on and on about so A-hole that offered support to McCain, not a friend of McCain or a guy who McCain sat with for 20 years. They made such a big deal about that, but with Obama, its no problem, just out of context stuff from a guy that Obama isn't responsible for--lol.\n\n \n As a matter of fact, McCain sought the endorsement of Hagee, whereas Obama has distanced himself from Wright and publicly denounced his words as well as the offered endorsement from Louis Farrakhan. And although I have not heard McCain's opinion regarding the words of Hagee, I, for one, doubt that he shares the view that the Catholic church is \"The Great Whore,\" or that \"military confrontation with Iran is foretold in the Bible as a necessary precondition for the Second Coming.\" (link). What concerns me instead is McCain's confusion regarding Al Qaeda and Iran, and his admitted lack of knowledge concerning economics.",

   " Interesing aside, but what does this have to do with the campaign? \n\n \n Mostly persons' impression that his minister is (1) a national security risk, and (2) that this reflects on Obama. Tending to President Johnson's most private medical concerns, or being warmly greeted by Clinton at a prayer breakfast, strikes me as an individual who has been cleared by the top levels. \n \n \n Funny how this keeps getting brought up when Obama has pretty much an insurmountable lead. \n\n \n That's not the case. It's actually quite close at present, with Clinton ahead in key states, point-wise.\n \n \n Do you really think this is a possibility? They are going to attack each other until the convention and then suddenly reconcile as running mates? Good luck.\n\n \n Well, they will need to reconcile (and starting, now) if the one who comes out of the cleaners wishes to lead nationally. I don't think the Democrats are unaware of this issue. And, since the race is so closely divided, and, with each candidate carrying a good portion of what the other shall need to get the national result. IMO, Clinton is the most electable, the most feared by McCain. Has been from the beginning. But Obama supporters obviously have a different perspective. One way or another, though, we won't find out, will we. And, assuming I am correct, Republicans will push Obama, not Clinton, however indirectly. They've been doing that anyway, from the beginning. \n \n But I am glad this thread establishes that their former affection for Obama was not all it initially seemed. And that they are capable of being just as brutal with his public image as they have been with Clinton's. What we know with Clinton, however, is that she can outlast the worst of 'em. Give Barack 4-8 years with Hillary and he, too, will be tough as Lyndon Johnson and Harry Truman.\n \n Then we'll send him in for the presidency for another 4-8. This should not be difficult, if Obama is as good as they say. Not just a passing fancy. In which case, we stand to gain a great deal more with him in the vice presidency, and then, the presidency at a somewhat different life stage.

   "Some of you are just nuts. Seriously, it saddens me that most of you are right and yet so wrong.\n \n Yes, it does royally suck that we find ourselves trying to figure out which candidate is the least bad rather than the best. But this has become reality.\n \n I used to argue that I vote for the candidate more than I vote for the party. Not so much in this election.\n \n The past decade-and-a-piece have shown that the Repugnantcans are utterly despicable. They have destroyed many of the things that make this country great. A year ago, I truly believed that even most Republicans in positions of power could see what was going on and could be relied upon to implement a change if given the opportunity. I can't really say the same anymore. I'm back to calling them Rethuglicans, because that's exactly what those in power are: a you-pat-my-back,-I'll-pat-yours group of selfish, fearmongering, religiously driven nutcases who care nothing about anything but their own indoctrinated ideology and their pocketbooks, but they're too damn stupid to realize that they're shooting themselves in the foot financially and making their adherence to dipstick mythological stories look even more ridiculous than it already is.\n \n There is no excuse for what the Rethuglican party as a whole has \"accomplished\" since 1994. Blatant fiscal irresponsibility (and on multiple levels: undertaxing, overspending, overborrowing, removing fiscal safeguards and oversights (while dumping tons of tax dollars into selective bailouts), and countless other pieces that together have our economy on the brink of collapse), the attempt at establishing a Christian government (what with the appointment of far-right judges to the SCOTUS, attempts at re-establishing prayer in public schools, the reintroduction of creationism into public schools in violation of federal law), eroding our Constitutional rights time and time again while actively arguing the legality and necessity of such violations of the founding ideas of this country, instituting policies to remove federal employees for purely political reasons and lying about it repeatedly after getting caught, tampering with elections and arguing against a method that would prevent further election tampering, starting and continuing with no plan to end a frivolous and unjustified war that has cost trillions of dollars and thousands of American lives -- countless (literally) Iraqi lives -- for political reasons instead of safety reasons, all masterminded by (the advisors who are able to manipulate) a monkey whose IQ probably qualifies him to live in a \"special\" residence.\n \n Election stealing aside, plenty of dumbass Americans voted for this idiot even the second time.\n There's no excuse for that, either.\n \n I recommend that people get their heads out of their asses and realize that this has become the modus operandi of the Rethugs, and despite the righty Presidential hopefuls who entered the race to make a change, the Rethuglican fan base decided to oust change for the better so that they could have more of the same.\n \n At this point, the Dems could nominate an actual monkey, and I'd vote for the monkey. The #1 goal that voters of this country should have is to get (and keep) the Repugnantcans out of power until they give a sh*t.\n\n \n \n Brother, I feel what you are saying and I too have been very disapointed in the Pubs. However, if one of the two dem candidates are elected and the house and senate stays in dem control, I feel that we'll be longing for the days when we only had billions in debt but still had an economy and a country that could at least be put back together.",

If you understand economics (which given your history, is dubious), Clinton DID reduce future debt. Debt and its interest is partially serviced though issuance of more debt. Vicious cycle really (it's going to get much worse due to the Republicans). We issue debt to pay debt, kind of like refinancing. What Clinton did was slow the growth of deficits and therefore debts, and therefore reduced the amount of new debt that was necessary to service the existing. \n \n And every President reduces the debt. Debt notes have maturity dates. Every president's budget includes amounts to pay for the maturation of debt notes. It is the offset that we care about. How much new debt did we issue compared to the amount that is annually retired or early retired? And as I understand it, Clinton engaged in significently more debt early retirement then other presidents. So Electro is stating the truth that Clinton did significently reduce the debt, which my figures suggest to be around $237 billion. That's pretty significant. What Electro did not mention was that more then $237 billion was issued per year.\n \n Clinton's projections of a surplus, which is actually unrelated to the amount of debt we have, was false for a simple reason: Things like the postal service were off the financials.",

   " There's no way in hell they're ever going to put that genie back in the bottle. \n\n \n The genie will come out of the bottle whether anyone likes it or not, if Justices who are older retire. I understand this is expected in the next two administrations for about 3, some of whom are on the \"liberal\" side of the court. Whereupon JSM has promised to appoint \"strict constructionist judges\" -- which is code, we all know, for overturning Roe.\n \n \nAgain, I just can't see SCOTUS taking reproductive rights away from women. \n\n \n The predicted scenario is that change (in that specific arena, i.e. Roe) will come down through the states. We shall start to see large swaths of the U.S. whereby abortion is no longer legal. Over the next decades, we shall also see the American legal landscape change significantly in other respects -- for example, prayer in the public schools, the anti-science education folks gaining an upper hand. Other ways, too; but in those respects, what I imagine you'd sympathize with insofar as change is concerned -- pro big corporate interests, non-labor sympathetic, anti-environmental, a discriminatory free-hand (anti civil rights) ... i.e. \"libertarian\".\n \n \n GOOD! \n\n \n I don't condone what happened there. As much as I disagree politically with the persons they were mocking, many were honest, hard-working individuals who sincerely believed in what they were doing and trusted their public officials. They were betrayed and stabbed in the back by the lying two-faced Bush Administration.\n \n \n\n Are you kidding me? The stuff that Wright was saying was completely unacceptable and If it were a white guy saying that stuff about other races and McCain (or any Pub) had attended it ONCE let alone 20 years that person's career would be over.

I think its disingenuous of you to claim I'm trying to 'rattle people's cages' with it. You wouldn't feel that way if it was on 'the other side'. \n\n \n Well, I've already described my opposition to many of his statements on this thread. So I think it is disingenous of you to suggest otherwise. And, I've also stated that I'm not aware of all the statements in question -- which you are not clearly indicating for the purposes of this discussion. \n \n But, the sermon in full that I listened to (and linked the audio earlier here, and again, http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2008/03/21/the-full-story-behind-rev-jeremiah-wrights-911-sermon/ via Anderson Cooper) -- I don't see what's so racist or anti-American to people. That is, the Malcolm X \"chickens coming home to roost\" quote in context right after 9-11. This was not comparable to, say, a white minister proclaiming that New Orleans deserved what it got, because \"God\" was sending down his wrath on a sinning people -- as, for example, that minister who said it was because of gay folks that the New Orleans hurricane and national disaster happened (when, btw, GWB thought it was MORE important to drop in on a birthday celebration for JSM -- how's THAT for anti-Americanism?). He was saying that this horrible thing that happened on our soil was a forseable consequence of a horrible foreign policy, as implemented by GW Bush ... and, as reflecting a long line of rotten foreign policies that this country was founded and developed on. Whereupon, he went into a number of examples reflecting what his intended meaning was. And, I agreed with much of he said. Like, the point that this nation was founded on the butchering of Native Americans. Do you deny that? That wasn't a racist statement. That was description and condemnation of a racist foreign policy.\n \n Here's Anderson Cooper summarizing and exerpting at the site with the audio link. And btw, he wasn't even quoting Malcolm X directly; \n \n ...He was actually quoting Edward Peck, former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and deputy director of President Reagan's terrorism task force, who was speaking on FOX News. That's what he told the congregation.\n \n He was quoting Peck as saying that America's foreign policy has put the nation in peril:\n \n \"I heard Ambassador Peck on an interview yesterday did anybody else see or hear him? He was on FOX News, this is a white man, and he was upsetting the FOX News commentators to no end, he pointed out, a white man, an ambassador, he pointed out that what Malcolm X said when he was silenced by Elijah Mohammad was in fact true, he said Americas chickens, are coming home to roost.\"\n \n \"We took this country by terror away from the Sioux, the Apache, Arikara, the Comanche, the Arapaho, the Navajo. Terrorism.\n \n \"We took Africans away from their country to build our way of ease and kept them enslaved and living in fear. Terrorism.\n \n \"We bombed Grenada and killed innocent civilians, babies, non-military personnel.\n \n \"We bombed the black civilian community of Panama with stealth bombers and killed unarmed teenage and toddlers, pregnant mothers and hard working fathers.\n \n \"We bombed Qaddafi's home, and killed his child. Blessed are they who bash your children's head against the rock.\n \n \"We bombed Iraq. We killed unarmed civilians trying to make a living. We bombed a plant in Sudan to pay back for the attack on our embassy, killed hundreds of hard working people, mothers and fathers who left home to go that day not knowing that they'd never get back home.\n \n \"We bombed Hiroshima. We bombed Nagasaki, and we nuked far more than the thousands in New York and the Pentagon and we never batted an eye.\n \n \"Kids playing in the playground. Mothers picking up children after school. Civilians, not soldiers, people just trying to make it day by day.\n \n \"We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans, and now we are indignant because the stuff that we have done overseas is now brought right back into our own front yards. America's chickens are coming home to roost.\n \n \"Violence begets violence. Hatred begets hatred. And terrorism begets terrorism. A white ambassador said that y'all, not a black militant. Not a reverend who preaches about racism. An ambassador whose eyes are wide open and who is trying to get us to wake up and move away from this dangerous precipice upon which we are now poised. The ambassador said the people we have wounded don't have the military capability we have. But they do have individuals who are willing to die and take thousands with them. And we need to come to grips with that.\"\n \n He went on to describe seeing the photos of the aftermath of 9/11 because he was in Newark, N.J., when the planes struck. After turning on the TV and seeing the second plane slam into one of the twin towers, he spoke passionately about what if you never got a chance to say hello to your family again.\n \n \n Goodnight. Talk to you soon. I've been really busy so I've not been on much. Very tired....\n\n \n I'll catch you on your other more quickly covered points (on the candidate's policies) another time.\n \n BTW, this is what JSM -- who was partying with Bush in the aftermath of Katrina -- is starting to (unsurprisingly) say repeatedly about Barack, in terms of foreign policy. Since I suppose they think he might be the nomination winner, and it's time to get started with the same stuff they've been dishing out to Hillary for many years .. but in a different way (she's dishonest, he's inexperienced), over and over and over and over again for the media bites and the American T.V. and internet user:\n \n Obama has \"no experience or background\" on national security, McCain#says\n http://embeds.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/04/01/obama-has-no-experience-or-background-on-national-security-mccain-says/\n \n And, of course, WHY Stanley Fish of the NY Times said McCain would pull the lever for Obama, instead of Clinton:\n \n http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/why-mccain-would-vote-for-obama/index.html\n \n That is, my take on electability issues, again. Whoever wins the nomination, and whoever I decide to vote for, by that point. But if it is Obama, I suggest he start to get a lot more familiar with the WW II experience/perspective. Hillary, I wouldn't worry about. She'll be pummeling McCain after school gets out.*\n \n \n \n * Whereupon, he can run to the teacher and report his classmate.

   "Antonia, hillary's not only a liar, but a sociopathic liar, here's another perspective for you to consider.\n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu9Oqz_xHEXABtLJXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByMDhrMzdqBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNQRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAw--/SIG=11va1dpls/EXP=1207836970/**http%3a//www.wnd.com/index.php%3fpageId=60452\n Of course, anyone who has followed Hillary Clinton's path through the 1990s knows she lies. That's not even debatable. What this anecdote illustrates so clearly is how easily she lies &#8211; how effortlessly. She lies without giving it a second thought. She lies not only about her own experiences, but the experiences of others. She lies about public events that have been recorded on video. She lies when there is no reason to lie &#8211; if she thinks she can persuade one more voter she is experienced and brave.\n \n As an employer, if a job applicant lies in his or her resume, I scratch the person from my list of considerations for the position. I don't think I'm alone in this practice. If a job applicant is going to lie about his or her background, can I really trust this person to carry out his or her responsibilities faithfully and honestly? I don't think so.\n \n The American people have got to start thinking about politicians as their employees. Why? Because that's what they are. Politicians are, in effect, campaigning to persuade citizens to hire them as public servants. Proven liars should be cast out of consideration without a second thought.\n \n Sociopathic liars like Hillary Clinton &#8211; people who lie as a matter of course, for any reason or no reason at all &#8211; should have their resumes thrown into \"the circular file.\"\n \n Unrepentant liars like Hillary are not fit for the public office of dogcatcher, let alone commander in chief.\n \n For those of you willing to give her a pass on this, please consider the following: Have you ever been shot at? Do you think you would remember vividly if you had been? Do you think it is possible to imagine that you were shot at during a well-documented public event when, in fact, no shots were fired?\n \n I don't have much use for her husband's administration, but didn't she indict Bill Clinton as a coward with her assertion that he sent the first lady on foreign missions he considered too dangerous? How bizarre is it to make such a statement &#8211; and to make it repeatedly over a three-month period?\n It really doesn't speak well for your sense of discernment and good judgment for you to give such an historically well known liar a pass as you're doing for Hillbilly. It shows that you suffer from a similar character weakness, not to recognize such a blatant and obvious flaw in her character.\n \n And here's a video of her contradicting herself a number of times within a few minutes in the same debate.\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qggO5yY7RAo",

Here is the story from your own link:\n in March 1996 Hagee caused a furor when he created an uproar in the black community of Texas. Major newspapers of the area reported on his plan to conduct a \"slave sale.\" The auction was an attempt to raise money for a seniors' class trip from his private Cornerstone High School. He announced to the congregation that \"slavery in America was returning to Cornerstone\"3 and that each senior \"would be auctioned off.\" The highest bidder could have a \"slave\" work at their house, so the congregation should make plans to \"go home with a slave.\"\n \n The fund-raising project was seen as insensitivity and a massive error in judgment. Reaction to the plan was fast and furious. Area newspapers further reported that after a weekend of criticism, Hagee issued an apology. He renamed the enterprise \"a student auction.\"",

Fortunately for her, Nixon resigned and she never filed the brief. Had she done so, she would have been exposed by the court and likely disbarred.

That's the kind of dishonest creep you support.\n \n She and Bill stole FBI files on hundreds of political opponents. That's the kind of creep Hillary is.\n \n She fabricated a story about sniper fire in Bosnia, much the same as John F. Kerry fabricated his \"heroic actions\" in Vietnam. That's the kind of creep she is. (I think it runs in the Democratic party these days.)\n \n She (and her cronies) fabricated a story about a woman recently being denied hospital care. That's the kind of lying creep she is.\n \n She and Bill had Vince Foster killed. That's the creep you want to be our President.\n \n What will it take to convince you that Hillary is a LIAR?",

   "I've addressed this issue numerous times on these threads. That you don't understand grey thinking, Jim, is not my problem, but yours instead.\n \n I don't know if Hillary has ever lied to us. I don't know whether or not many of our politicians have or haven't lied. Thus, I am a pragmatist, here. \n \n I look for what I think is the best interests of the country, prior records on issues, and predictability re performance on those issues. Not a bunch of crappy propaganda reels that would be laughed out of any reputable journalism class.\n \n I think what's really going is that we disagree on Iraq, the economy, healthcare, education, et al ... and you consistently dodge advancing any arguments there or why you're really supporting certain candidates ... because you know you don't have one leg on solid ground for standing.\n \n It's all quicksand beneath you, Jim.\n \n I think it would be major achievements for the next 4 year administration to get us out of Iraq, institute universal health care, sign international agreements on environmental protection, get excellent appointments to the courts, stabilize the downward heading American economy ... just among many other things that could be done in that relatively very short time period ... \n \n So I could care less about a court case settled by a jury of peers under our Constitution, and just because the videographer didn't like the judge. Or that you liked a lying crook named Richard Nixon, who covered up a massacre of civilians and had young children bombed with napalm .. and Hillary helped get him thrown out. Good. That's yet one more redeeming quality in her.\n \n I didn't vote for George Bush either time ... did you? How's your judgment and discernment record?\n \n 4000 Americans dead, tens of thousands permanently disabled, and John McCain doesn't want their health care paid for by the government. 600,000 Iraqis gone along with their entire country. Afghanistan now the world's greatest heroin producer. 18,000 Americans dead every year on American soil because we don't have universal health care. Thousands gone in the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, in the fields of Pennsylvania while GW said, \"Say .... what?\" People dying in the streets of New Orleans while the King played a guitar on the west coast and went partying with John McCain. \n \n Shall we start on the trade agreements, too? And how many have crossed into the U.S. illegally? While George Bush and John McCain, friend of big business, winked and nodded?\n \n I think you should be ashamed of yourselves on this board.\n\n Gee, one would think that Bush was a candidate in this election the way some are berating him as the focus of their attacks. Shall we go back and discuss the criminal acts of Bill Clinton whom Hillary supported so staunchly which is just more confirmation of her criminal character? So I repeat for your consideration the acts and proven lies that define this sociopathic liar. \n \n And the fact that you can't see through what she represents just speaks volumes about who you are also. 2 peas in a pod I'd say.\n \nAntonia, hillary's not only a liar, but a sociopathic liar, here's another perspective for you to consider.\n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu9Oqz_xHEXABtLJXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByMDhrMzdqBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNQRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAw--/SIG=11va1dpls/EXP=1207836970/**http%3a//www.wnd.com/index.php%3fpageId=60452\n Of course, anyone who has followed Hillary Clinton's path through the 1990s knows she lies. That's not even debatable. What this anecdote illustrates so clearly is how easily she lies - how effortlessly. She lies without giving it a second thought. She lies not only about her own experiences, but the experiences of others. She lies about public events that have been recorded on video. She lies when there is no reason to lie - if she thinks she can persuade one more voter she is experienced and brave.\n \n As an employer, if a job applicant lies in his or her resume, I scratch the person from my list of considerations for the position. I don't think I'm alone in this practice. If a job applicant is going to lie about his or her background, can I really trust this person to carry out his or her responsibilities faithfully and honestly? I don't think so.\n \n The American people have got to start thinking about politicians as their employees. Why? Because that's what they are. Politicians are, in effect, campaigning to persuade citizens to hire them as public servants. Proven liars should be cast out of consideration without a second thought.\n \n Sociopathic liars like Hillary Clinton - people who lie as a matter of course, for any reason or no reason at all - should have their resumes thrown into \"the circular file.\"\n \n Unrepentant liars like Hillary are not fit for the public office of dogcatcher, let alone commander in chief.\n \n For those of you willing to give her a pass on this, please consider the following: Have you ever been shot at? Do you think you would remember vividly if you had been? Do you think it is possible to imagine that you were shot at during a well-documented public event when, in fact, no shots were fired?\n \n I don't have much use for her husband's administration, but didn't she indict Bill Clinton as a coward with her assertion that he sent the first lady on foreign missions he considered too dangerous? How bizarre is it to make such a statement - and to make it repeatedly over a three-month period?\n It really doesn't speak well for your sense of discernment and good judgment for you to give such an historically well known liar a pass as you're doing for Hillbilly. It shows that you suffer from a similar character weakness, not to recognize such a blatant and obvious flaw in her character.\n \n And here's a video of her contradicting herself a number of times within a few minutes in the same debate.\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qggO5yY7RAo\n\n \n \nAnd in case that isn't enough to convince you of how corrupt the Clintons are, here is more. Pt 1 and Pt 2 of undeniable evidence of some of their crimes and how expert they are of not only covering them up but of throwing friends under the proverbial bus in order to protect themselves.\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq8aopATYyw&feature=related\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMfUajhL24I&feature=related\n\n \n \nJust admit it antonia, you're a Hillary apologist who is dedicated to blindly following her no matter what direct evidence you're confronted with regarding her poor character. That's why debating you is a waste of time but posting revealing info about her to expose her criminal acts is the only responsible thing to do.\n",

Now, I haven't ever contacted admin about checking your IP address because I don't want to get you banned again. But it might be a good idea for you not to troll after me if you know what I mean.\n \n \nWOW, talk about an extremist ploy to lie about a fund raiser in order to turn a bad marketing idea into the promoting of slavery. Can you be any more dishonest Capo? You should be ashamed of yourself for implying that he was promoting slavery, but I know you'll neither be ashamed, or apologize for lying or misrepresenting the truth. Here, from your own link is the rest of the story; and yes, it may have been insensitive, but it in no way promoted or endorsed a return to slavery at all. Here is the story from your own link:\n in March 1996 Hagee caused a furor when he created an uproar in the black community of Texas. Major newspapers of the area reported on his plan to conduct a &#8220;slave sale.&#8221; The auction was an attempt to raise money for a seniors&#8217; class trip from his private Cornerstone High School. He announced to the congregation that &#8220;slavery in America was returning to Cornerstone&#8221;3 and that each senior &#8220;would be auctioned off.&#8221; The highest bidder could have a &#8220;slave&#8221; work at their house, so the congregation should make plans to &#8220;go home with a slave.&#8221;\n \n The fund-raising project was seen as insensitivity and a massive error in judgment. Reaction to the plan was fast and furious. Area newspapers further reported that after a weekend of criticism, Hagee issued an apology. He renamed the enterprise &#8220;a student auction.&#8221;\n\n \n And you never responded to this dishonest claim either. You know that just posting false claim and never defending them is trolling, don't you?\n \n \nSure Capo, I'm all for full disclosure. So get Hillbilly to release all of the records she has had sealed until 2050. And would you care to post a link which shows that Mcain is a member of Hagees church? And better still, would you post a link of anything Hagee has done that he should be ashamed of or scorned for?\n",

It has been shown with undeniable evidence that Hillary Clinton is a power mongering criminal and a liar. She has a long proven track record of sleazy and immoral acts while allegedly serving the public interest. I have posted massive amounts of evidence proving that on the previous page, not to mention what others have posted. If not for gullible and naive people who continue to get sucked in by her lies and support her dreams of self serving power, she would have been forced out of the public eye long ago and could have melted into the obscurity that she so richly deserves. \n \n The rest of your diatribe shows how little you understand the true principles which the bible stands for as you attempt to lay guilt on me as if I'm a lousy christian for honestly stating my opinions here. You prove that the Liberal believes in free speech as long as everyone agrees with their perspective. Once someone dares to oppose their secular humanist Worldview, they immediately attempt to stifle them just as you have done in the post I'm responding to. \n \n I understand both the bible and the Constitution and respect them both which is why you and I disagree on so many issues. The word tolerance is a modern liberal term for accepting every type of sin imaginable to the fallen Man. Jesus wasn't tolerant of sin. If you'll read His Gospel you'll see that as He forgave a person for their sins, He always said \"now go and SIN no more\". He never said go and be tolerant of the sins people commit. Think about that as you're judging me for speaking my honest opinion on an open debate forum.",

But again, how typical is it that a Clinton apologist would excuse them while condemning their business partner. Here's an excerpt from the link:\n This article summarizes the following video clips which detail Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee and his business partner Peter Paul being exploited by Bill and Hillary Clinton for campaign contributions arising from an August 2000 benefit fundraiser which Bill and Hillary later denied accepting. The Clintons then proceeded to destroy the company Stan Lee created with Peter Paul and jailed Peter Paul after he spoke out about the fraud that the Clintons were engaging in. \n \n The eventual trial concerning the Clinton's involvement in election law fraud was largely covered up by the media, followed by circumstances showing a Clinton appointed judge \"fixing\" the trail proceedings to exonerate them from any wrongdoing which would have ended Hillary's political career as well as resulting in a lengthy prison sentence for her, even though video evidence exists of her involvement in the crimes.\n \n The following video clip is from the full length hour long video \"Hillary!Uncensored.\" The video clips are summarized below.",

That's not even debatable. What this anecdote illustrates so clearly is how easily she lies - how effortlessly. She lies without giving it a second thought. She lies not only about her own experiences, but the experiences of others. She lies about public events that have been recorded on video. She lies when there is no reason to lie - if she thinks she can persuade one more voter she is experienced and brave.\n \n As an employer, if a job applicant lies in his or her resume, I scratch the person from my list of considerations for the position. I don't think I'm alone in this practice. If a job applicant is going to lie about his or her background, can I really trust this person to carry out his or her responsibilities faithfully and honestly? I don't think so.\n \n The American people have got to start thinking about politicians as their employees. Why? Because that's what they are. Politicians are, in effect, campaigning to persuade citizens to hire them as public servants. Proven liars should be cast out of consideration without a second thought.\n \n Sociopathic liars like Hillary Clinton - people who lie as a matter of course, for any reason or no reason at all - should have their resumes thrown into \"the circular file.\"\n \n Unrepentant liars like Hillary are not fit for the public office of dogcatcher, let alone commander in chief.\n \n For those of you willing to give her a pass on this, please consider the following: Have you ever been shot at? Do you think you would remember vividly if you had been? Do you think it is possible to imagine that you were shot at during a well-documented public event when, in fact, no shots were fired?\n \n I don't have much use for her husband's administration, but didn't she indict Bill Clinton as a coward with her assertion that he sent the first lady on foreign missions he considered too dangerous? How bizarre is it to make such a statement - and to make it repeatedly over a three-month period?\n It really doesn't speak well for your sense of discernment and good judgment for you to give such an historically well known liar a pass as you're doing for Hillbilly. It shows that you suffer from a similar character weakness, not to recognize such a blatant and obvious flaw in her character.\n \n\n \n \n Perhaps, along with Peter Paul, you too are a pathological liar. Let's see ... you tout the merits and honesty of an individual who directed a 8.75 million dollar fraud on the Cuban government, whereby he was found guilty of federal conspiracy charges; he trafficked cocaine, he violated parole trying to cross international borders with the identity of a dead man, he engaged in millions in securities fraud - causing \"losses to the investing public and financial institutions of approximately 25 million dollars\", fled the country for Brazil, was extradited back to the United States ...\n \n It really doesn't speak well of your character that you give such a historically well known liar a pass.\n \n Oh ... would you also like a link to the Peter Paul youtubes you recommended?\n emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Yeah, WND is an excellent source for news. I mean, look at this headline:\n \"Soy is making kids 'gay'\"\n \n emoticon_wow\n\n \n Although I agree with you regarding how foolish this sounds at first glance. Further research shows that the estrogen in soy does have some potentially disturbing side affects. The bolded sections speak directly to some very real possible side effects that if one reads WAY into them, he might be able to worry about the higher estrogen levels affecting developing boys sexuality. I'm not saying I think this, but it hasn't been proven that it couldn't happen according to this article.\n \n http://www.mothering.com/articles/growing_child/food/soy_story.html\n Soy and Reproduction: Breeding Discontent \n Scientists have known since the mid-1940s that phytoestrogens can impair fertility. Fertility problems in cows, sheep, rabbits, cheetahs, guinea pigs, birds, and mice have all been reported.63, 64 Although scientists discovered only recently that soy lowers testosterone levels,65 tofu has traditionally been used in Buddhist monasteries to decrease the libido, and by Japanese women to punish straying husbands. Humans and animals appear to be the most vulnerable to the effects of soy estrogens prenatally, during infancy and puberty, during pregnancy and lactation, and during the hormonal shifts of menopause. Of all these groups, infants on soy formula are at the highest risk because of their small size and developmental phase, and because formula is their main source of nutrient.66, 67\n \n A crucial time for the programming of the human reproduction system is right after birth-the very time when bottles of soy formula are given to many non-breastfed babies. Normally during this period, the body surges with natural estrogens, testosterones, and other hormones that are meant to program the baby's reproductive development from infancy through puberty and into adulthood. For infants on soy formula, this programming may be interrupted.68-70\n \n Male infants experience a testosterone surge during the first few months of life and produce androgens in amounts equal to those of adult men. So much testosterone at such a tender age is needed to program the body for puberty, the time when a male's sex organs should develop and he should begin to express male characteristics such as facial and pubic hair and a deep voice. If receptor sites intended for the hormone testosterone are occupied by soy estrogens, however, appropriate development may never take place.71-74 To date, most of the evidence damning soy formula can be found only in animal studies, because investigations in which humans' sex hormone levels are lowered experimentally cannot ethically be done. However, in the years since soy formula has been in the marketplace, parents and pediatricians have reported growing numbers of boys whose physical maturation is either delayed or does not occur at all. Breasts, underdeveloped gonads, undescended testicles (cryptorchidism), and steroid insufficiencies are increasingly common. Sperm counts are also falling.75-79\n \n Soy formula is bad news for girls as well. Natural estrogen levels approximately double during the first month of life, then decline and remain at low levels until puberty. With increased estrogens in the environment in the diet, an alarming number of girls are entering puberty much earlier than normal.80-82 One percent of girls now show signs of puberty, such as breast development or pubic hair, before the age of three. By the age of eight, 14.7 percent of Caucasian girls and 48.3 percent of African American girls had one or both of these characteristics.83 The fact that blacks experience earlier puberties than whites is not a racial difference but a recent phenomenon.84, 85\n \n Most experts blame this epidemic of \"precocious puberty\" on environmental estrogens from plastics, pesticides, commercial meats, etc., but some pediatric endocrinologists believe that soy is a contributor.86 Of all the estrogens found in the environment, soy is the likeliest explanation of why African American girls reach puberty so quickly. Since its establishment in 1974, the federal government's Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program has provided free infant formula to teenage and other low-income mothers while failing to encourage breastfeeding. Because of perceived or real lactose intolerance, black babies are much more likely to receive soy formula than Caucasian babies.\n \n Early maturation in girls heralds reproductive problems later in life, including amenorrhea (failure to menstruate), anovulatory cycles (cycles in which no egg is released), impaired follicular development (follicles failing to mature and develop into healthy eggs), erratic hormonal surges, and other problems associated with infertility. Because the mammary glands depend on estrogen for their development and functioning, the presence of soy estrogens at a susceptible time might predispose girls to breast cancer, another condition that is on the rise and definitively linked to early puberty.87\n \n Recently, a team of researchers headed by Brian L. Strom, MD, studied the use of soy formula and its long-term impact on reproductive health. They announced only one adverse finding: longer, more painful menstrual periods among women who'd been fed soy formula in infancy.88 Dr. Strom's conclusion that the results were \"reassuring\" made newspaper headlines all over the world, though the data in the body of the report were anything but. Indeed, data left out of the headlines and buried in the report revealed higher incidences of allergies and asthma, and higher rates of cervical cancer, polycystic ovarian syndrome, blocked fallopian tubes, and pelvic inflammatory disease.89 Although thyroid damage from soy formula has been the principal concern of critics for decades, the researchers excluded thyroid function as a subject for study. Not surprisingly, this study was funded in part by the infant-formula industry.\n \n Most of the fears concerning soy formula have focused on estrogens. There are other problems as well, notably much higher levels of aluminum, fluoride, and manganese than are found in either breastmilk or dairy formulas.90-96 All three metals have the potential to adversely affect brain development. Although trace amounts of manganese are vital to the development of the brain, toxic levels accrued from ingestion of soy formula during infancy have been found in children suffering from attention-deficit disorders, dyslexia, and other learning problems.97, 98\n \n Soy apologists sometimes argue that the plant hormones in soy formula could not possibly be harmful because Japanese women eat a lot of soy products and so must have high levels of phytoestrogens in their breastmilk. Researchers, however, have measured the soy isoflavones in breastmilk and found them low even in vegetarian women who consume copious quantities of tofu, soy milk, soy protein shakes, and other soy foods.99-101\n \n Limited evidence, however, suggests that vegetarian women who eat a lot of soy foods during pregnancy may put their infants at risk in terms of their future reproductive health, fertility, and possibly increased risk of breast cancer. All of the problems that have befallen infants on soy formula, as well as estrogen-related birth defects, have occurred (in animal studies, at least) to the offspring of mothers who were given high doses of soy during pregnancy.102 One of these birth defects that has been linked to vegetarian diets in humans is hypospadias, a developmental disorder in which the opening of the penis is located on the underside of the shaft.103\n \n Until soy estrogens are definitely linked to reproductive-tract abnormalities, infertility, and other health problems in humans, most health authorities recommend that we \"wait and see.\" This could be a terrible mistake.\n \n In the 1940s and 1950s, another estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), was widely given to Western women early in their pregnancies in a misguided attempt to prevent miscarriage. That fact is relevant not only because DES bears a striking structural similarity to some plant estrogens-including soy isoflavones-but because it took more than 20 years before the full spectrum of harmful effects was observed.104, 105\n \n DES is 100,000 times more potent than soy phytoestrogens. However, the large quantities of phytoestrogens in soy products are more than enough to counteract their lower potency. When the effects of isoflavones in fetal and neonatal animals have been studied, they have paralleled those observed in human infants exposed to DES.106, 107 Recent studies indicate that the soy isoflavone known as genistein may be even more carcinogenic than DES.108\n \n Yet the belief persists that soy hormones are \"safe\" because they are \"weak\" and \"natural.\" Although the soy industry has claimed that soy estrogens are anywhere from 10,000 to 1,000,000 times weaker than the human estrogen estradiol, the correct figure is only 1,200 times as weak.109 Though this still sounds quite weak, it is not-because of the quantity of these estrogens ingested by infants on soy formula, and by children and adults who eat soy every day. These individuals consume far more soy estrogens than were ever part of a traditional diet in Asia. The average isoflavones intake in China is 3 milligrams, or 0.05 mg per kilogram of body weight. In Japan, the figures range from 10 to 28 mg, or 0.17 to 0.47 isoflavones per kg of body weight. In contrast, infants receiving soy formula average 38 mg of isoflavones, which comes to a shocking 6.25 mg/kg of body weight. Compare that dose to the 0.47 mg/kg per day fed to healthy Japanese adult men and women who experienced thyroid suppression after just three months-or to the 0.75 mg/kg of isoflavones fed to American women who experienced hormonal changes sufficient to skew their menstrual cycles after just one month.110 Although children and teenagers are less vulnerable than infants, their young bodies are still developing, and highly vulnerable to endocrine-system disruption by soy. And soy has been shown to pass through the placentas of pregnant women to their unborn babies.\n \n Meanwhile, the jury is still out on whether soy might help alleviate menopausal symptoms or prevent osteoporosis and breast cancer. The soy industry's top scientists, convened at the Fifth International Symposium on the Role of Soy in the Preventing and Reversing Chronic Disease (held in Orlando, Florida, September 21-24, 2003), conceded that the data are confusing and contradictory, with some studies suggesting that soy might be helpful, and others showing that soy contributes to osteoporosis and promotes breast cancer.\n \n What's certain is that the levels of soy estrogens that might possibly have a beneficial effect on hormonally related diseases have been proven to jeopardize the health of the thyroid. Likewise, the 25 grams of soy protein per day touted by the FDA to lower cholesterol (see sidebar, \"Boon to the Industry: The FDA's Soy Protein Health Claim\") is very likely to harm the thyroid, and thus increase one of the risk factors for heart disease.\n \n The bottom line is that the safety of soy foods has yet to be proven, and that human beings have become guinea pigs in what Daniel M. Sheehan, formerly senior toxicologist with the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research, has called a \"large, uncontrolled and basically unmonitored human experiment.\"111",

It is very interesting and makes sense that at a crucial time for the programming of the human reproduction system is right after birth-the very time when bottles of soy formula are given to many non-breastfed babies. Normally during this period, the body surges with natural estrogens, testosterones, and other hormones that are meant to program the baby's reproductive development from infancy through puberty and into adulthood. For infants on soy formula, this programming may be interrupted.\n \n And also, soy formula is bad news for girls as well. Natural estrogen levels approximately double during the first month of life, then decline and remain at low levels until puberty. With increased estrogens in the environment in the diet, an alarming number of girls are entering puberty much earlier than normal. One percent of girls now show signs of puberty, such as breast development or pubic hair, before the age of three. By the age of eight, 14.7 percent of Caucasian girls and 48.3 percent of African American girls had one or both of these characteristics. The fact that blacks experience earlier puberties than whites is not a racial difference but a recent phenomenon.\n \n Most experts blame this epidemic of \"precocious puberty\" on environmental estrogens from plastics, pesticides, commercial meats, etc., but some pediatric endocrinologists believe that soy is a contributor. These are all valid points that can't be denied as we have witnessed them in our own children. Everyone knows today how early girls develop physically. So are the claims made in the WND article completely whacked and estrogen in soy couldn't possibly effect the testosterone production of infant boys who are producing high levels of testosterone at that time of their life in order to form their masculine and sexual identities? I don't know, but it's an interesting question.\n \n \nYeah, WND is an excellent source for news. I mean, look at this headline:\n \"Soy is making kids 'gay'\"\n \n emoticon_wow\n\n \n \nAlthough I agree with you regarding how foolish this sounds at first glance. Further research shows that the estrogen in soy does have some potentially disturbing side affects. The bolded sections speak directly to some very real possible side effects that if one reads WAY into them, he might be able to worry about the higher estrogen levels affecting developing boys sexuality. I'm not saying I think this, but it hasn't been proven that it couldn't happen according to this article.\n \n http://www.mothering.com/articles/growing_child/food/soy_story.html\n Soy and Reproduction: Breeding Discontent \n Scientists have known since the mid-1940s that phytoestrogens can impair fertility. Fertility problems in cows, sheep, rabbits, cheetahs, guinea pigs, birds, and mice have all been reported.63, 64 Although scientists discovered only recently that soy lowers testosterone levels,65 tofu has traditionally been used in Buddhist monasteries to decrease the libido, and by Japanese women to punish straying husbands. Humans and animals appear to be the most vulnerable to the effects of soy estrogens prenatally, during infancy and puberty, during pregnancy and lactation, and during the hormonal shifts of menopause. Of all these groups, infants on soy formula are at the highest risk because of their small size and developmental phase, and because formula is their main source of nutrient.66, 67\n \n A crucial time for the programming of the human reproduction system is right after birth-the very time when bottles of soy formula are given to many non-breastfed babies. Normally during this period, the body surges with natural estrogens, testosterones, and other hormones that are meant to program the baby's reproductive development from infancy through puberty and into adulthood. For infants on soy formula, this programming may be interrupted.68-70\n \n Male infants experience a testosterone surge during the first few months of life and produce androgens in amounts equal to those of adult men. So much testosterone at such a tender age is needed to program the body for puberty, the time when a male's sex organs should develop and he should begin to express male characteristics such as facial and pubic hair and a deep voice. If receptor sites intended for the hormone testosterone are occupied by soy estrogens, however, appropriate development may never take place.71-74 To date, most of the evidence damning soy formula can be found only in animal studies, because investigations in which humans' sex hormone levels are lowered experimentally cannot ethically be done. However, in the years since soy formula has been in the marketplace, parents and pediatricians have reported growing numbers of boys whose physical maturation is either delayed or does not occur at all. Breasts, underdeveloped gonads, undescended testicles (cryptorchidism), and steroid insufficiencies are increasingly common. Sperm counts are also falling.75-79\n \n Soy formula is bad news for girls as well. Natural estrogen levels approximately double during the first month of life, then decline and remain at low levels until puberty. With increased estrogens in the environment in the diet, an alarming number of girls are entering puberty much earlier than normal.80-82 One percent of girls now show signs of puberty, such as breast development or pubic hair, before the age of three. By the age of eight, 14.7 percent of Caucasian girls and 48.3 percent of African American girls had one or both of these characteristics.83 The fact that blacks experience earlier puberties than whites is not a racial difference but a recent phenomenon.84, 85\n \n Most experts blame this epidemic of \"precocious puberty\" on environmental estrogens from plastics, pesticides, commercial meats, etc., but some pediatric endocrinologists believe that soy is a contributor.86 Of all the estrogens found in the environment, soy is the likeliest explanation of why African American girls reach puberty so quickly. Since its establishment in 1974, the federal government's Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program has provided free infant formula to teenage and other low-income mothers while failing to encourage breastfeeding. Because of perceived or real lactose intolerance, black babies are much more likely to receive soy formula than Caucasian babies.\n \n Early maturation in girls heralds reproductive problems later in life, including amenorrhea (failure to menstruate), anovulatory cycles (cycles in which no egg is released), impaired follicular development (follicles failing to mature and develop into healthy eggs), erratic hormonal surges, and other problems associated with infertility. Because the mammary glands depend on estrogen for their development and functioning, the presence of soy estrogens at a susceptible time might predispose girls to breast cancer, another condition that is on the rise and definitively linked to early puberty.87\n \n Recently, a team of researchers headed by Brian L. Strom, MD, studied the use of soy formula and its long-term impact on reproductive health. They announced only one adverse finding: longer, more painful menstrual periods among women who'd been fed soy formula in infancy.88 Dr. Strom's conclusion that the results were \"reassuring\" made newspaper headlines all over the world, though the data in the body of the report were anything but. Indeed, data left out of the headlines and buried in the report revealed higher incidences of allergies and asthma, and higher rates of cervical cancer, polycystic ovarian syndrome, blocked fallopian tubes, and pelvic inflammatory disease.89 Although thyroid damage from soy formula has been the principal concern of critics for decades, the researchers excluded thyroid function as a subject for study. Not surprisingly, this study was funded in part by the infant-formula industry.\n \n Most of the fears concerning soy formula have focused on estrogens. There are other problems as well, notably much higher levels of aluminum, fluoride, and manganese than are found in either breastmilk or dairy formulas.90-96 All three metals have the potential to adversely affect brain development. Although trace amounts of manganese are vital to the development of the brain, toxic levels accrued from ingestion of soy formula during infancy have been found in children suffering from attention-deficit disorders, dyslexia, and other learning problems.97, 98\n \n Soy apologists sometimes argue that the plant hormones in soy formula could not possibly be harmful because Japanese women eat a lot of soy products and so must have high levels of phytoestrogens in their breastmilk. Researchers, however, have measured the soy isoflavones in breastmilk and found them low even in vegetarian women who consume copious quantities of tofu, soy milk, soy protein shakes, and other soy foods.99-101\n \n Limited evidence, however, suggests that vegetarian women who eat a lot of soy foods during pregnancy may put their infants at risk in terms of their future reproductive health, fertility, and possibly increased risk of breast cancer. All of the problems that have befallen infants on soy formula, as well as estrogen-related birth defects, have occurred (in animal studies, at least) to the offspring of mothers who were given high doses of soy during pregnancy.102 One of these birth defects that has been linked to vegetarian diets in humans is hypospadias, a developmental disorder in which the opening of the penis is located on the underside of the shaft.103\n \n Until soy estrogens are definitely linked to reproductive-tract abnormalities, infertility, and other health problems in humans, most health authorities recommend that we \"wait and see.\" This could be a terrible mistake.\n \n In the 1940s and 1950s, another estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), was widely given to Western women early in their pregnancies in a misguided attempt to prevent miscarriage. That fact is relevant not only because DES bears a striking structural similarity to some plant estrogens-including soy isoflavones-but because it took more than 20 years before the full spectrum of harmful effects was observed.104, 105\n \n DES is 100,000 times more potent than soy phytoestrogens. However, the large quantities of phytoestrogens in soy products are more than enough to counteract their lower potency. When the effects of isoflavones in fetal and neonatal animals have been studied, they have paralleled those observed in human infants exposed to DES.106, 107 Recent studies indicate that the soy isoflavone known as genistein may be even more carcinogenic than DES.108\n \n Yet the belief persists that soy hormones are \"safe\" because they are \"weak\" and \"natural.\" Although the soy industry has claimed that soy estrogens are anywhere from 10,000 to 1,000,000 times weaker than the human estrogen estradiol, the correct figure is only 1,200 times as weak.109 Though this still sounds quite weak, it is not-because of the quantity of these estrogens ingested by infants on soy formula, and by children and adults who eat soy every day. These individuals consume far more soy estrogens than were ever part of a traditional diet in Asia. The average isoflavones intake in China is 3 milligrams, or 0.05 mg per kilogram of body weight. In Japan, the figures range from 10 to 28 mg, or 0.17 to 0.47 isoflavones per kg of body weight. In contrast, infants receiving soy formula average 38 mg of isoflavones, which comes to a shocking 6.25 mg/kg of body weight. Compare that dose to the 0.47 mg/kg per day fed to healthy Japanese adult men and women who experienced thyroid suppression after just three months-or to the 0.75 mg/kg of isoflavones fed to American women who experienced hormonal changes sufficient to skew their menstrual cycles after just one month.110 Although children and teenagers are less vulnerable than infants, their young bodies are still developing, and highly vulnerable to endocrine-system disruption by soy. And soy has been shown to pass through the placentas of pregnant women to their unborn babies.\n \n Meanwhile, the jury is still out on whether soy might help alleviate menopausal symptoms or prevent osteoporosis and breast cancer. The soy industry's top scientists, convened at the Fifth International Symposium on the Role of Soy in the Preventing and Reversing Chronic Disease (held in Orlando, Florida, September 21-24, 2003), conceded that the data are confusing and contradictory, with some studies suggesting that soy might be helpful, and others showing that soy contributes to osteoporosis and promotes breast cancer.\n \n What's certain is that the levels of soy estrogens that might possibly have a beneficial effect on hormonally related diseases have been proven to jeopardize the health of the thyroid. Likewise, the 25 grams of soy protein per day touted by the FDA to lower cholesterol (see sidebar, \"Boon to the Industry: The FDA's Soy Protein Health Claim\") is very likely to harm the thyroid, and thus increase one of the risk factors for heart disease.\n \n The bottom line is that the safety of soy foods has yet to be proven, and that human beings have become guinea pigs in what Daniel M. Sheehan, formerly senior toxicologist with the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research, has called a \"large, uncontrolled and basically unmonitored human experiment.\"111\n",

   "By JEFF ZELENY\n Published: April 11, 2008GARY, Ind. - Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell may have contributed $2,300 to the Republican presidential campaign of Senator John McCain, but he is reserving his strongest praise for the Democratic candidacy of Senator Barack Obama.\n \n In a television interview that was broadcast Thursday, Mr. Powell said he \"admired\" how Mr. Obama handled a speech last month on race. He also said he agreed with much of what Mr. Obama had said about the controversial sermons of his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr.\n \n \"I thought that Senator Obama handled the issue well,\" Mr. Powell told ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" \"He didn't abandon the minister that brought him closer to his faith, but at the same time he deplored the kinds of statements that the Reverend Wright had made.\"\n \n Mr. Powell noted that he was friends with all three presidential candidates. While he said he had not decided whom to support, he said he was impressed by Mr. Obama's ability to \"learn quickly.\"\n \n \"With Senator Obama, he didn't have a lot of experience running a presidential campaign, did he?\" Mr. Powell said. \"But he seems to know how to organize a task, and he seems to know how to apply resources to a problem at hand.\"\n \n Mr. Obama said that he had not spoken to Mr. Powell recently, but that he valued his remarks.\n \n \"He's somebody whose counsel I value,\" Mr. Obama told the Chicago television stations WGN and CLTV, \"and I'm grateful for his recognition that we can have differences of opinion - or be part of different political parties - but that we can still acknowledge the service we are rendering to the country.\"\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/11/us/politics/11campaign.html?_r=5&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=login",

Here are a few of those testimonials...\n I applaud your courage for publishing the excellent article on the risks and benefits of soy products, \"The Whole Soy Story,\" by Kaayla Daniel (May-June 2004). I found the article a refreshing alternative look at a food that seems to be almost universally embraced as a panacea for every ill. Throughout the article, I found that the author maintained a balanced point of view, even when presenting information that was rather alarming. I found the guidelines for soy consumption to be particularly useful. I relate to the article from my own experience. When I was vegan and macrobiotic, I consumed rivers of soy milk. I never had worse digestion, blotchier skin, or more irregular menstrual cycles. Currently, I am an omnivore, consuming quarts of raw milk from grass-fed cows, along with good butter, grass-fed meat, and lots of fresh organic vegetables-and my skin is clear, my menstrual cycles run like clockwork, and my digestion is great. \n Victoria Bloch \n Los Angeles, California\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n I was so happy to finally see, in a popular magazine, the truth about soy! I used to use soy in a powdered drink. I went through a two- to three-year period of horrible menstrual cycles. At age 35 I had my first child, stopped using soy, and followed a traditional diet-all organic, including meat, cheese, and dairy. After nursing, I began my soy regime again. My menstrual cycles continued to be heavy and last for a full week (plus some). I quit using all soy products, and within two months my menstrual cycles changed drastically-for the better. People need to be aware that we (women) tend to be estrogen dominant, and we don't need more of the hormone from the foods we consume! \n J. Meyer \n Fowlerville, Michigan\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n I found out the hard way about the media lies concerning soy after weaning my first child from breastmilk when he was 22 months old. Knowing that commercial milk was dangerous to consume, I put him on what I thought was a healthy alternative: soy milk. He rapidly turned into a hyperactive nightmare. I attributed it to the \"terrible twos\" and was told it would pass. Well, it didn't pass! Shortly after my son turned 3, a dear friend told me to question my choice of soy milk as a milk substitute. I did some in-depth research and was horrified to find that hyperactivity is one of the many possible effects of soy consumption in children. I immediately took him off of soy milk. Within three weeks his behavior completely normalized. \n Sarah Pope \n Lutz, Florida",

Read on...\n \n http://www.heritage.org/Research/features/issues/issuearea/Budget.cfm\n \n \n \n Federal Budget and Spending\n \n \n \n \n \n By Brian M. Riedl\n \n \nFederal spending has reached $22,000 per household, in constant dollars, for the first time since World War II. \"Discretionary\" spending voted on each year by Congress has jumped 49 percent in just three years, and entitlement spending nears 11 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the first time ever. Furthermore, the upcoming retirement of the baby boomers will put an enormous strain on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid and sharply increase spending. It is imperative for lawmakers to get the nation&#8217;s finances in order immediately by restructuring entitlement programs and reducing federal spending. Putting off the difficult decisions until the federal budget&#8217;s condition deteriorates further will result in much harsher and more expensive policy choices. \n Recommendations\n \n \n Freeze 2007 discretionary spending and remember that the core problem is runaway federal spending, not the budget deficit or taxes that are too low. Current budget deficits are merely a symptom of a larger problem: runaway spending. Lawmakers should prioritize economic growth and the low taxes needed to spur growth and recognize that runaway spending represents the most dangerous long-term threat to pro-growth tax relief. As long as federal spending remains low enough to maintain a prosperous, low-tax economy, the budget deficit will solve itself. A positive first step would be freezing 2007 discretionary spending at the 2006 level. \n Rein in runaway entitlement spending. The retirement of 77 million baby boomers could well push Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid spending to unsustainable levels. The total cost of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is projected to leap from today&#8217;s 8.4 percent of GDP to 18.9 percent of GDP by 2050. In the absence of reform, lawmakers face three options: (1) raise taxes every year until they are 57 percent ($11,000 per household) higher than today; (2) eliminate every federal program except Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid by 2045; or (3) do nothing and watch the federal debt expand so that even a minor interest rate response would induce a spiral of rising debt and interest rates, threatening the entire economy. Clearly, reforming these programs is the only real option. \n Reform the budget process. The current budget process encourages runaway federal spending because of its incentives and rules. Budget resolutions are rarely enforced, meaningful spending caps are absent, and lawmakers can create major new entitlements without proposing any plan to pay for them. Senators and Representatives who generally support spending restraint should not also seek earmarked pork-barrel spending or special programs. Budget process reform should be based on four principles: (1) establish a limit on overall spending; (2) present a full picture of future obligations in the budget; (3) bring the President into the budget process, mainly by giving the budget resolution the full force of an act of Congress; and (4) strengthen the enforcement of budget decisions.\n",

The entire system of the United States, has been based on private property rights and the incentive that those rights give people to work hard and be productive. You can't tell me that people are more inclined to work hard for 'the good of the country' rather than for 'the good of their family'.

The tax code is 200,000 pages long. You don't understand what you are talking about if you think that the fair tax would increase the size of govt. Under the fairtax, everyone gets a rebate check that eliminates the total tax up to the poverty level. Even if the checks were only mailed to the poor (which is incorrect) it would be nothing compared to the compliance that is necessary now.\n \n \n \n \nIt's called the black market, which typically arises from higher rates which can't be escaped. Under your argument, the rich will simply turn to hard to trace transactions and will hide the money. In the end tax revenues go down. Do you realize just how much money isn't taxed on transactions through Ebay? Or how much isn't taxed between two individuals who don't make paper records? That aspect will exploded. \n\n \n Yes, the black market, like drugs will exist. However, when the dealers or whatever need to buy something from the store, the tax is collected. The black market is already factored into the plan.\n \n \nYour ignorance is again appalling. A number of methods now exist to ignore taxes. China towns across the US are notorious for under reporting taxes. It's not hard. Just don't enter the transaction. There is nothing to suggest that a fair tax will decrease the black market as well as decrease tax evasion. At least with the current tax system people have incentives to enter transactions as they can take them out of earnings as expenses. With a pure sales tax that doesn't exist. You just stripped away incentives to book transactions. \n\n \n There are people who will cheat in ANY system. Those caught will be punished.\n \n \n \n \nAnd how will you verify that without income taxes? Your plan requires an expansion of government to huge proportions.\n \n Your liberalism is showing. Or perhaps you have forgotten that Conservatism is actually about smaller government?\n\n \n \n You obviously haven't even taken a minute to think through the repercussions of the fairtax or the current system of the IRS before commenting on.",

   "Nonsense. First view inheritance in a real instance. Picture a farm. Dad works hard making the land productive and produces 'produce' for sale.

With a 100% tax rate, why would they work hard to make the farm productive, just to hand it over to the govt.?

Do you realize how many transactions occur minutely on Ebay? To tax those we'd need to either force Ebay to collect taxes or track down every person and force them to pay taxes on whatever they bought. Good luck with that.

However, there are certain problem with capitalism, just like there are certain problems with your concept of involute property rights. Land is a good example.

However, I've seen first had the devastation that has accompanied the 'war on poverty'. I've met tons of people who've never had to work, never will work, and are quite happy about that. I've seen people turned in to Dependant, helpless husks that will never be able to 'make it' on their own because they've never had to try. Give a man a fish, feed him for a day.

However, since there is currently a death tax that is more than 0 and less than 100, I suppose that you've already got the compromise...\n \n \n\n Now, now, no need for the insults. I am not an elitist pooh (whatever that means). It was a valid question (part of the middle ground question). Do you:\n a) allow rich kids to keep everything daddy has earned.\n\n \n Damn near it. All that money has already been taxed before.\n \n \n \nb) spread a bit around to those who are doing their damnedest from a very difficult situation.\n\n \n Who's trying their best? How are we to find those special few? Besides, the question's with out merrit since there ARE lots of programs that allow people to get a hand up, a hand out, or a nap at noon or a weekday!\n \n [QUOTE]I applaud your hard work and your ability to make something of a very difficult position, but there will have been others who tried just as hard as you did, but were unable to make it. My question was, should they be rewarded for the effort or left to rot because society is geared towards the status quo?\n\n That does not answer the question either.\n\n \n We've got a system that works pretty well at rewarding both those who deserve it and those who don't. I mean, people on welfare still have cable and HBO as well as (usually) a car and air conditioning. Some people will fail and many more won't even try and there are programs to help them and their kids, but there must be NEGATIVE consequences to bad choices or everything falls apart.\n \n \nSo, let's try again, without all the flying off the handle this time.\n \n Where is the middle ground?\n\n \n Again, I guess we're there since we're somewhere between 1 adn 100%\n \n I will state very clearly once more that 100% death tax is not the way to go, but then neither is 0% death tax. Have you gathered that this time?\n \n \nDo we:\n a) give people a basic health service regardless of their income.\n\n \n We already do (actually much more than 'Basic')! My wife is from Mexico and you'd never believe how many pregnant illegals are perfectly well taken care of (at least here in SC and considering we trail every other state just about I imagine there are plenty of services elsewhere as well). In addition to that there's ALWAYS the hospital which can't turn anyone away. We're fine. We don't need another program, especially one that will make Medicare look CHEAP! \n \n \nb) allow people to slip into declining health and lingering death because they cannot afford to visit a hospital\n\n \n It's already free. And by the way, I don't have any health insurance, but I pay for a doctor when I need to go and when I decide to get insurance, I'll just have to work harder or give up other, less important things. That's the responsibility of living in a free society!\n \n \nDo we:\n a) give people affordable housing when they are finding it hard to cope, thus giving them the opportunity to better themselves.\n\n \n We already do. However, I will repeat, 'giving' someone something is a slippery slope, especailly when you must 'take' it away from someone else first.\n \n\n b) sod the lot of them because there are some who do not have the sense or respect to look after the housing that they are offered.\n \n Smiley\n\n \n Again, there must be a requirement for people to be responsible for themselves or they will end up wards of the state.",

Here\\'s an excerpt:\n \n http://www.newsmax.com/kessler/obama_wright/2008/04/28/91553.html\n \n Obama Distorted Rev. Wright\\'s Background \n Monday, April 28, 2008 9:39 AM \n \n In an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, Barack Obama again fabricated the background of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright to try to excuse his longtime pastor's denunciations of America and of whites.\n \n Referring to racial discrimination, violence, and segregation, Obama said Wright \"went through experiences that I never went through.\"\n \n In his speech on race in Philadelphia, Obama made similar claims. He described a \"lack of economic opportunity among black men, and the shame and frustration that came from not being able to provide for one's family . . .\"\n \n Obama said this was \"the reality in which Reverend Wright and other African-Americans of his generation grew up . . . For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away; nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years.\"\n \n But as detailed in an April 13 Newsman article, \"Obama's Rev. Wright Mythology,\" Obama's characterization of his mentor's upbringing is untrue.\n \n Wright grew up in a racially mixed, middle-class section of Philadelphia called Germantown, which consisted of homes on broad tree-lined streets. Both his parents had good jobs: His father was a pastor; his mother was vice principal of Philadelphia High School for Girls.\n \n Wright was privileged to attend the elite Central High School, which admits only the most highly-qualified applicants from all over the city. When Wright attended Central High, the student body was 90 percent white, according to students who attended at around the same time.\n \n Wright's classmates clearly respected him. The 211th class yearbook described him as the \"epitome of what Central endeavors to imbue in its students.\"\n \n In contrast to Wright, Bill Cosby, who also attended Central High, has denounced the black culture of victimhood that Wright has promoted in his sermons, a culture that Cosby says sets up blacks for failure.",
