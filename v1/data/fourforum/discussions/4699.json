   "My essay:\n \n \"They are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights...\"\n Edowed: inherited through existence\n Unalienable: incapable of being alienated, surrendered, or transferred\n \n We have heard these words many times and have undoubtedly passed over them a time or two. However, it is necessary and vital that we pause and consider these words which reflect much about the governmental paradigm our forefathers and the worldview which shaped this nation. \n \n We hold these truths to be self evident.  \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n \n Our forefathers viewed these (all assumptions underlying the previous statements) as truths which were observable (self-evident) and indisputable. They viewed that there are certain rights that transcend society and culture. This phrase, which comes straight from the declaration of independence and is revisited in the constitution, is the cornerstone of our constitution. Therefore, it can be said that this concept (that there are transcendent rights endowed by someone higher than government) is the foundation of our entire government. In the declaration we read the very purpose of the structure of government as viewed by our forefathers. The purpose of government is:\n \n That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,  \n \n Because these rights (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) transcend all of humanity, we must recognize that it is any government's responsibility to secure those rights for all members of the human race. \n \n So where do these rights come from?\n Well, if you ask a theist they will say they were endowed by God (the creator). If you ask a naturalist they will say they were created in the mind of man (endowed by nature). If you ask a transcendentalist they will say they were endowed by the force, Luke. However, rarely will someone who is reasonable deny they exist. Wherever you might like to say these rights originate, you are foolish to deny the existence of these certain inalienable rights (if not for the sheer purpose and means of self preservation!).\n \n It is essential to recognize that these rights do not come from government but are merely recognized by government. Therefore, we conclude that since they do not come from government, they should not be taken away by government.\n \n Let us examine these rights.\n We should be careful to observe any place where the concept of rights is mentioned in the documents. In observing we must look and seek to understand each right in the light and context of this statement: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \n \n First, let us examine the right to life. It is interesting to note that this right is mentioned first, and that it is mentioned first for a reason. The right to exist is a fundamental right. Once one obtains the genetic code that is specific to the human race, one exists. From this point on one has a right to continue to exist and this right no one can dispute.\n \n Now, lets examine the right to liberty. What is liberty? What is true freedom? Bottom line, this must be defined as free choice in every circumstance. However, does the possibility exist that there is a type of liberty which transcends all of the experiences of mankind? Is there an ultimate freedom which frees mankind from oppression? I leave this for the reader to examine.\n \n Finally, the right to the pursuit of happiness. This is the \"whatever floats your boat\" right. Happiness is different things to different people and has been viewed as a celebration of individuality. However, is it possible that a true and ultimate happiness exists which transcends all of mankind? A certain happiness that enthralls men and brings them unsurpassing joy? Again, I leave this for the reader to examine.\n \n An understood and observed logical hierarchy of rights.\n We can observe within the constitution and declaration a hierarchy of rights. This hierarchy is based upon one foundational right and that is the right to life. All rights derive themselves from this fundamental right. It is reasonable to say that without this right there would be no other rights. \n \n For example, let us consider one scenario within the constitution. We have the right to bare arms. This right would not exist were it not for (partly) a right to defend oneself. The right to defend one's self would not exist were it not for the right to liberty and property. The right to liberty and property would not exist were it not for the right to life (were it not for the right of a human to continue to exist).\n \n It is reasonable for one to acknowledge that in order to be happy one must be free to be happy(whatever one's definition of happiness), and in order for one to be free to be happy one must exist to be free.\n \n What happens when the rights of two persons appear be in conflict?  \n Upon casual reading one may conclude that all rights are of equal quality. However, this cannot be the case. It must be noted that the right to life is of a different quality of all other rights. The right to life is a right of sanctity and dignity while the right to happiness is a right which determines the quality of that sanctity and dignity. \n \n Whenever we see a confliction of rights within our culture there is always a right which takes precedent. Your right to bare arms stops with my right to defend myself. A rapist's right to happiness stops with the victim's right to liberty. A murderer's right to happiness stops with the victim's right to life. In every conflict of rights, it is necessary that the more fundamental right take precedent. \n \n Let us a look at the mother's right to choose whether or not to donate her bodily resources vs. the baby in the womb's right to life (the right to continue to exist). The conflict of rights between the mother's right to happiness and freedom may sometimes be in conflict with the baby's right to life. Comparing these to rights as equal is impossible and unreasonable. The right to life is of a different quality then all of the other rights. The right to life is the assumption of all other rights, and to assume it to be equal to any other right is to commit a fallacy.\n \n When it comes to a fundamental right to life(the sanctity and dignity of a human life) vs. a right to happiness (the quality and personal desires of a human life). Which one should win? Well which one is more fundamental? Upon the fundamental right to life hang all other rights bestowed upon humanity and all laws which government can ethically mandate.\n \n So, my question remains:  \n Why is there even an option of abortion (other then when the baby's right to continue to exist conflicts with the mother's right to continue to exist)?\n Here is what I think. Those whose transcendent fundamental right to life is being trampled upon are being denied their right to life because they have no voice. Neither do they have the power to stand up for themselves. They are the most innocent among us. They are the weakest of the weak. They are the smallest of the small. Therefore no one notices when fundamental incomparable right to life is denied to these voiceless human beings. While so many are choosing the road of selfishness in exchanging another's right to continue to exist for their own posh lifestyle and convenience, let those who have a voice and a heart cry out for equal justice under law for all. \n \n There may come a day when out of duty America's citizens must make application of this statement found in the declaration.\n That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  \n \n In our dynamic culture, let us embrace a culture that values a right to life. Otherwise we always be moving toward the antithesis and will become a culture that embraces death.",

The right to life cannot be compared to the right to freedom or happiness. This is an unequal comparison.\n \n \nSo by all means, that right is not fundemental. \n\n Yes it is. The victimizer robbed the victim of all of the rights when he took the right to life. The right to life is a necessary right for all other rights to exist. There for it is a fundamental right.\n \n \nHow can a slave owner say all of humanity possessed these rights yet deny them to women, minorities and slaves? Seems like humanity is either white, land owning men, or they simply did not believe in such a idea or believed it was not applicable at the time. All go contrary to your argument. \n\n The slave owners had a wrong understanding of humanity. This doens't negate the fact that the slaves were endowed with rights by their creator. Just because a murderer doesn't think the victim has a right to life doesn't make it so. Those penning these documents were observers of these transcendent rights.\n \n \nWhat they SAID and what they DID are two very different things. I'm applying what they did. And what they did goes contrary to your argument.\n\n What they did was wrong. This does not change the fact that certain inalienable rights exist of these being a fundamental right to life. This is how you are able to say that slavery was wrong. These guys just observed that the rights existed. They weren't the ones who originated them. These rights were bestowed.",

Hence, such a statement is blanket and therefore meaningless. As soon as one disagrees, the blanket falls apart and loses all crediblity. \n \n \n\n Right, they are endowed. The fundamental rights are not given by government. Our founding fathers recognized this. If you are a human you have fundamental rights. They are recognized and secured by government.\n\n \n Very silly. Oh so very silly. Before there was government, did you have rights? Did you have a right to life? no. Something could have killed your mother and bam you never had that right. Did you have a right to property? No. Something could have taken your property from you and you couldn't have done anything.

You said that they thought all humanity had them, but why did they act in a contrary manner? Again, deal with your contridictions before posting to me. \n \n gnojek: Rights as we mean in application. You can think you have everything, does it mean you do? No. Hence with rights. Rights are given, they are not fundemental. Our rights now are protected by force.

   "If you have an argument that has the premise rooted in the constitution, without any reference to gods, or the declaration, I'd like you to post it, having some more logic-driven debates on a hot-topic are always a good thing, in this case it's logic-driven, just with a flawed premise.\n \n In the end your entire argument fails because it's essentially an appeal to authority, that is, the authority of our forefathers as thinkers (which some indeed were). An argument needs to stand on the basis of sound logic and reason alone, not be rooted in the thoughts and ideas of some other person.\n\n \n The arguement that the forefathers had is what the constitution is based on. The declaration of Independance is what our country is based on. If the arguement has no standing then our country has no standing. We have FAITH (key word) that what they came up with is something good to keep our society rolling...and for so long they have been right, why try to rebuild the foundation when you already have the house.\n \n \nYou are right in the wallet scenario but if the government didn't send the person to jail or attempt to get your wallet back than you wouldn't have that right to property.\n\n \n So if the government never caught them your right would have never been violated? As I keep saying, the idea that government establishes the right is just not true. The government simply enforces the rights that you already have. The Bill of Rights was created to try and make sure the government didn't destroy your basic rights.\n \n Whether or not a government exists...you still have the right to life. This is because a government does not and can not give rights at least in the US. Our foundation to this country is clearly based on this thought. If you don't believe that, and you believe that government can make rights...then the government could say \"all killing is legal\" and you have no rights...So when your mother gets killed, will you be ok with it? If not, why not? No right was stepped on. What do you care?...the answer is, you care because you believe in a basic right to live (when you boil it down). Where does that come from? Well, thats another debate, but you could say it is a natural law.\n \n The founding fathers had their basic rights infridged upon by England. This is what led them to say \"hey, we got some basic rights that you can't step on\". So they wrote it out, sent it to England, had a war, decided they didn't wanna be in a government that \"makes\" rights, so they created one that was different. Now we are chipped away at that foundational thought, so where will that take us? Ever take the foundation away from a building...what happens?",

Unalienable rights means the rights can't be transfered to someone, doesn't mean they can't be restricted...big difference...You can be put in jail but your right to liberty is not given to the person that put you there. Haven't we been through this?\n \n Also, lets assume that there are two rights that exist...right to life and right to ones own body....one has to trump the other...why doesn't life trump?

I claim that does not make it relevant, since it's still just a document, that is not part of the U.S. legal system. \n \n \n[list]I argue from the Declaration of Independence because I value the principles that our entire system is founded upon.\n\n THAT'S the fallacy ^^ if your reason for XYZ being \"correct\" or \"just\" or \"true\", and it's an ethical, moral, or otherwise \"choice\" driven claim, your back to appealing to a document. It can be your motivation, go for it. Probably a good motivator too, but it's not a reason in and of itself. Same reason most christians don't even follow their dogmatic bible literally, it's just some OTHER humans (misguided) opinons.\n \n \n I will say this again, that our government was formed to secure the rights acknowledged in the Declaration of Independence. This is not up for dispute. This is historical fact, and is reflected in the Constitution itself as can be seen when comparing Article V with the following quote:\n Arguments should be based on principles (as the founders' were), not public opinion.\n\n \n That's simply an opinion of yours. If the founders had wanted to declare that the government was formed to secure the rights acknowledged in the Dec of Ind., they would have written \"This government is formed to secure the rights in the declaration of independance\".\n \n They didn't, you just made it up. They actually chose NOT to say that. How interesting. You are arguing against the fact that the declaration is not part of the U.S. government. It's a fact, it's not open to discussion.\n \n \n \nYou said This is nothing more than an appeal to authority (society), and by your own standard, I should not accept this as a backing for your argument. \n \n What a contradiction it is to say that I can't appeal to authority, but you can.\n\n \n Stating that it was the opinion of individuals that drove the reasoning behind the abolition of slavery, and not the authority of a document as dogma, is not an appeal to society. I'm not making a claim, I'm stating a fact. People chose to abolish slavery, they decided, in their heads, they chose. If you wish to argue that they were instead under mind control go ahead. Did the declaration motivate them? Did they persuade people by referencing it? Probably, I'll take your word for it since it's irrelevant. What is relevant is that something is not right or wrong, because it's written down on a piece of paper. That's the 'ole appeal again.\n \n \n \nSo as long as society thinks slavery is ok, it's ok? \n\n \n OK to who? Society? Yes, of course. Logically if society thinks slavery is OK, then slavery is OK to the society.\n \n \n No, my point is that slavery was wrong before society agreed that it was wrong. I can say that with 100% certainty. Slavery was, is, and always will be wrong whether or not society or government say so.\n\n \n Nonsense. Slavery was OK..i.e. legal, for quite some time. It was also legal in many civilizations in history. You again, can argue the contrary, but it's pointless. It's a fact that slavery was legal in the U.S., and in many other civilizations before it.\n \n Slavery is a human concept, and \"wrong\" is a human concept, that's of course completely relative. Suggesting that slavery existed before humans existed as a species, or that something was \"morally wrong to humans\" before humans existed, is just silly. It's also a fact that no human terms or concepts existed before humans existed, to suggest otherwise is again, simply not logical.\n \n We are the music makers, we are the dreamers of dreams. - W. Wonka\n \n Humans determine what is right, what is wrong, to themselves, as a group for society, as a society for a global society, etc., etc., etc. It's human choice, hopefully in most cases, fueled by reason and logic.\n \n If you have a reason..that is, something based on reason (!!) that makes it clear why some biological matter should have rights, do tell. If you want instead to appeal to the declaration, you can do that too, I just wish you would choose not to. People can always spot the weak argument.\n That's why your argument goes from:\n \n The declaration of independance, a historical document.\n The constitution/U.S. government/legal system.\n Abortion implications\n Slavery\n Abe Lincoln and the declaration related to slavery\n Human rights existing before humans existed\n \n It's all over the place. How could 6 unrelated things all be \"evidence\" that you're correct? Mind boggling.\n \n -Mach",

Are you implying that a right is pre-existant of its enforcement, that a right must exist in order to be enforced?\n \n\n As soon as you define what it means for a right to exist (NOT to be enforced) I will answer. You seem to think that if you have a right the government must enforce it, and you claim you have that right but you can't prove it. A right isn't something concrete you can hold in your hand.\n \n \n\n Nature's Creator\n \n Human Life exists on the earth. \n \n\n and before humans there was much killing\n \n \n\n The same way the laws of gravity came to be. and the laws of thermodynamics and motion.\n \n\n You want to bring this in? The law of gravity is being enforced as we speak. Nature enforces it. You can't violate the laws of gravity and thermodynamics and motion (all of which are actually theories by the way, same as evolution, just wanted to point that out). Obviously people can kill. Even these forces kill. Earthquakes kill all the time, people drown, people fall (even gravity can kill). I would define a right as something being enforced, but if you want to have a separate definition, fine. Just PLEASE tell me what it is.\n \n \n\n This leaves us with just one moral absolute - that is there is no absolute ethic standard. That means any type of punishment for breaking any law is ethically unjustified. That means genocide is not right or wrong. That means you can't tell me that what hitler did was wrong. - This seems to me to be a big problem and threat to the survival of the human race.\n\n \n You're right, I can't tell you what Hitler did was wrong. But since humans are kind of fond of life they decided to agree not to kill each other. It isn't right or wrong, we just know if we do it nothing will stop someone else from doing it right back to us. Obviously they didn't make that agreement with fetuses. This is the same reason we kill other animals for sport and for food. There is no absolute right or wrong, we have just made the agreement to have our life, property, and freedoms protected but we give up the RIGHT to violate the life, property, and freedoms of others. Does that make since? This right existed before because we could kill people but now we don't have the right to do it because the government enforces it. Can I say I have the right to do whatever I want the government just doesn't enforce it? Of course not.",

That is the consequence of your worldview. The consequence of mine is that an absolute standard gives us the ability to deem actions right or wrong no matter what the time period in history, what public opinion says, no matter what the culture, no matter what the law says. Thus genocide, for instance, is always wrong (that is, never right) in every circumstance, in every culture, in every time period in history, no matter what the law says.\n \n \nNo. Logic has nothing to do with such relative terms.

Placing flowerly language on an action does not in any way soften its ethical implication.\n \n \nThere is no way around this, unless you claim to mind-read every aborter, and claim that there \"intent\" is to kill. You cannot read their minds, and so you cannot know what their motive is.\n\n see above.\n \n \nThis is Communistic in two senses\n a) Asserting everyone has some right to be kept alive at other peoples' expense.
