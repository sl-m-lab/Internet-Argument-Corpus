   "Spirituality, wellness, and health outcomes\n \n Research is consistently showing a positive relationship between spiritual practices and health outcomes. And there is growing scientific evidence showing that individuals' spiritual practices and beliefs provide them with hope, optimism, meaning, comfort, and peace when coping with stressors, diseases and challenges in life. \n \n Spiritual Practices & the relationship to disease prevention\n \n Existential spiritual practices such as believing in a Higher Power/God, having meaningful relationships and a clear purpose and meaning in life have been shown to calm the release of deleterious stress hormones, such as cortisol. In addition, spiritual practices have been shown to improve immune function, decreased heart rate, blood pressure, heart disease, and decrease the overall stress response, thereby preventing diseases and improving wellness. \n \n How Spiritual Practices can Prevent Diseases\n \n The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is linked to the major brain structures, and it regulates heart rate, blood pressure, emotions, etc. The ANS has two components: sympathetic (fight or flight), which is activated during stressful events, and the parasympathetic, which maintains balance, regulates sleep, induces mediation and other soothing spiritual activities, promotes cell growth, etc. During spiritual practices, such as prayer, meditation, etc, we induce the parasympathetic system and slow down the sympathetic system, hence preventing the release of stress hormones and its effects on bodily organs. Much more, during spiritual practices, the brain releases neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, which regulate our mood thus preventing diseases such as major depression and anxiety. In fact, research shows that those who frequently meditate, pray and have meaningful relationships have higher levels of dopamine, which is associated with increased energy, motor function, happiness, and less depression. \n \n References:\n \n 1.

So the question then becomes if there is bias is it rational and reasonable? If it isn't then you try and determine if the bias influenced the conclusions and adjust accordingly. If it is then it is hard to make claims of the conclusions being unfair. There is also the possibility that he may be biased, but it was not a meaningful factor in the conclusion. Further one must ask is there bias in the rebuttal and is that bias rational and reasonable? To the latter I would have to say no you bias is not rational and reasonable. This is clearly evidenced by your failure to either read the study or understand it, which is shown in your response.\n \n \n \n\"It is literally impossible for a moral, powerful and competent creator deity to exist, and for core Christian doctrine to be correct. This is because the extraordinary amount of human suffering..... The host of theological absurdities that result from the failure of a creator to protect the innocent children further wrecks Christian doctrine.\"\n\n \n This is relevant how? So is it only researchers who agree with the Bible are credible or they can disagree but can't be trusted to do objective research on anything effecting religion? Of course despite the number of fraudulent studies done in support of religion we should never question those because, there religious and everybody knows religion is always beneficial, even when you think it isn't.\n \n \n \nSpeaking of Biblical creationism, Paul expectorates, \"If astronomy, geology and radiometric dating demonstrated that the universe and our planet were just a few thousand years old, and that a great flood had engulfed the planet, then the Bible Genesis account would be verified.\"\n\n \n Would it not?\n \n \n \n(Paul's view that the Bible says the earth is only a few thousand years old is horse dung - exactly what you would expect from a Bible illiterate.

You can argue amongst yourselves on these issues since they really have nothing to do with this thread, but hey anything to distract from the point huh.\n \n \n \nSecond, did the study measure the number of innocent unborn children butchered in non-biblical abortions in this and other \"Christian\" nations and take that into account?\n\n \n Tell that to the first born egyptians, or the Caananites, Amorites Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and the Jebusites.\n \n Do abortion rates make a difference to the conclusions?\n \n Also the more religious nations had higher teen pregnancy rates, which would lead to the choice having to be made whether to abort or not.\n \n \nThird, did Paul mention the suffering of the gay men below, all of whom engaged in ungodly sexual relations in a predominately Christian nation (how does this and other un-Christian behaviors skew Paul's statistical conclusions)? \n\n \n Indirectly he did, the more religious a country was the higher the rates of teenage transmission of syphillis. \n \n \nYou want the answer to alleviating suffering?\n \n Jesus Christ. \n \n\n \n \n No that wasn't part of the research, but thanks for your opinion, I am sure it isn't biased.\n \n \nThere it is. His study admits that following Christ and Christianity is not the cause of the suffering. And Paul's bias \"suggests\" (more unfounded inferences from an atheist) moving away from Christianity is the answer. \n\n \n Yes, shocking you would not read the study. The study doesn't say Christianity is the cause of these problem, but you can not deny that it is worth looking into why the most religious nations have the most problems in these areas.

   "\n The bible does not say anything about eons. It says days....24 hours... 7 of them specifically. \n\n \n Another crackpot conclusion on your part. Let's look at the Hebrew word for day.\n \n Strong&#8217;s 3117 &#8211; yowm (yom) - day\n \n d. days, lifetime (pl.)\n \n e. time, period (general) \n \n \n Yowm - Hebrew Lexicon\n \n In my personal Strong&#8217;s Concordance, on page 48 of the definitions, it also has &#8220;or fig. (figuratively) a space of time defined by an associated term&#8221; (and context).\n \n You apparently didn't dig deeper into context, etc. \n \n For instance, on the third \"day,\" God formed the land out of the seas. There is no time frame given for the formation of the land and seas. Some time after the land was formed, God created the plants:\n \n Then God said, \"Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth\"; and it was so. (Genesis 1:11)\n \n And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. (Genesis 1:12)\n \n The text clearly states that the earth \"sprouted\" the plants (the Hebrew word deshe, Strong's #H1877, usually refers to grasses). The Hebrew word dasha, (Strong's #H1876) indicates that the plants grew from either seeds or small seedlings in order to have \"sprouted.\" In addition, these plants produced seeds. The Hebrew word here is zera (Strong's #H2233), which is most often translated \"descendants.\" This makes matters very difficult for the 24-hour interpretation. Not only do the plants sprout and grow to maturity, but produce seed or descendants. There are no plants capable of doing this within a 24-hour period of time. Things actually get worse for this interpretation. Genesis 1:12 clearly states that God allowed the earth to bring forth trees that bore fruit. The process by which the earth brings forth trees to the point of bearing fruit takes several years, at minimum. God did not create the trees already bearing fruit. The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means. Because the process of the third day requires a minimum period of time of more than 24 hours, the Genesis text for the third day clearly falsifies the interpretation that the days of Genesis one are 24-hour periods of time. Genesis Clearly Teaches that the Days Were NOT 24 Hours\n \n What's more, it gets even worse for you and your biblically-challenged gang in thinking the Bible stipulates 24 hour days.\n \n Genesis 2:4 literally reads, \"in the day (yom) of the Lord God making (made) the earth and heavens.\"\n \n Right away, Moses, the author of Genesis, who also wrote of the 'days' of creation, describes those 'days' as one day, or one time period. It's the same Hebrew word. The implication is clear - Moses' &#8220;day&#8221; (yom) in Genesis 2:4 refers not to a 24-hour day but, rather, to a much longer period of time&#8212;in this case, the entire span of creation events.\n \n You're busted. emoticon_xbouncer",

   "For instance, on the third \"day,\" God formed the land out of the seas. There is no time frame given for the formation of the land and seas. Some time after the land was formed, God created the plants:\n \n Then God said, \"Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth\"; and it was so. (Genesis 1:11)\n \n And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. (Genesis 1:12)\n\n And the evening and the morning were the third day. (Genesis 1:13)\n \n \n \nThe text clearly states that the earth \"sprouted\" the plants (the Hebrew word deshe, Strong's #H1877, usually refers to grasses). The Hebrew word dasha, (Strong's #H1876) indicates that the plants grew from either seeds or small seedlings in order to have \"sprouted.\" In addition, these plants produced seeds. The Hebrew word here is zera (Strong's #H2233), which is most often translated \"descendants.\" This makes matters very difficult for the 24-hour interpretation. Not only do the plants sprout and grow to maturity, but produce seed or descendants. There are no plants capable of doing this within a 24-hour period of time. Things actually get worse for this interpretation. Genesis 1:12 clearly states that God allowed the earth to bring forth trees that bore fruit. The process by which the earth brings forth trees to the point of bearing fruit takes several years, at minimum. God did not create the trees already bearing fruit. The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means. Because the process of the third day requires a minimum period of time of more than 24 hours, the Genesis text for the third day clearly falsifies the interpretation that the days of Genesis one are 24-hour periods of time. Genesis Clearly Teaches that the Days Were NOT 24 Hours\n\n It's amazing. You have no problem believing that god scooped up a handfull of dirt, formed it into a man, breathed into it's nostrils, and poof...instant Adam. Likewise, you have no problem with god making instant animals. But plants...oh those pesky plants...they don't just grow in a 24 hour period. If you buy the yarn that god can scoop up dirt and make a man, or god can create instant animals...why can't you buy that plants were created in a similar manner? \n \n And further...without animals yet, how is it that ~90% of our flowering plants (including fruit trees) exist? Only about 10% of plant life on earth can pollinate itself...the rest are dependent on bees and ants and bugs...which god had not yet made. Yet you claim: \"The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means.\" Uhhh....no.",

   "Pappy you said Communism was a religion and now you are backpedalling.\n\n \n Not at all. I will respond to the post addressing this above.\n \n \nIf communism was a religion then it should have been included in the study.\n\n \n No it should this has been explained why communism is not included and you have yet to address those reasons. Instead you keep insisting that since Trebor and I think it is it should have been included and since it was not the study is flawed. So because the study conforms to what you think it should be you think it is flawed. Again if Trebor and I did the study you might have a point, but since we did not you don't.\n \n In addition the countries surveyed have freedom of religion, are 1st world countries and democratically elected governments. How is a communist country compare to these criteria? It doesn't. Those are three more reasons communist nations are not included which you have failed to respond to.\n \n \nJapan should not have been included because it has no comparison or relevance to Christian European or US governments in relation to the article's premise.\n Like you said its comparing apples to oranges( or something like that).\n\n \n \n One more time since you obviously missed it \n \n Japan grants full religious freedom, allowing minority religions such as Christianity, Islam and Sikhism to be practiced. Figures that state 84% to 96% of Japanese adhere to Shinto and Buddhism are not based on self-identification but come primarily from birth records, following a longstanding practice of officially associating a family line with a local Buddhist temple or Shinto shrine.[2][3][4][5] About 70 percent of Japanese profess no religious membership,[6][7] according to Johnstone (1993:323), 84% of the Japanese claim no personal religion. And according to Demerath (2001:138), 64% do not believe in God, and 55% do not believe in Buddha.[8] Japanese streets are decorated on Tanabata, Obon and Christmas\n \n \n Japan is a 1st world country (the reasons why are irrelevent) Japan allows freedom of religion, Japan has an elected government.\n \n So why does Japan not fit the criteria? Because it isn't Christian or European?\n Doesn't matter, those were not requirements. Why did they not use South or Central America? High Christian population with high crime and poverty rates. Would have put the study through the roof, but they don't fit the criteria.\n \n \nYou say one thing then say what you say is irrlevant when it suits you.\n Its not about being stubborn, if anyone is stubborn its you...you wont admit you cannot support a bogus argument....\n Keep wriggling though...re post 77\n\n \n The only bogus argument is yours and I am not supporting it except that I keep responding to your asanine reasoning.\n \n \nThere are other reasons why this article is misguided if not dishonest..which I have explained\n\n \n Really, other than your misunderstanding of the criteria what else have you put forth?\n \n \nFreedumb uses the same argument as you..you dont understand and...Ive already explained..when I do and you havent..so he is more on your wavelength.\n\n \n How else do you argue someone who actually doesn't understand?\n \n \nActually I think he accuses others of being stubborn when they show he cant support his argument too...can I expect a snarky pm and a mention on your signature?\n\n \n Have you ever gotten either from me?

Claims that secular cultures aggravate abortion rates (John Paul II) are therefore contradicted by the quantitative data\n \n \n \nSeriously Pappy the study is fine if you are preaching to the converted but it is ( by its own admission) not a definitive study and is a bit half baked.\n\n \n If you could just give some credible reasons why it is half baked I might agree, but saying it is because it goes against common belief is not going to cut it.\n \n \nIt does not negate the view that a more religious society would make a better one..just highlight that one does not exist.\n\n \n What it does is show that the commonly held belief that religion is necessary for society and conversly without religion society cannot be functional.\n \n As I stated in the op\n \n Now this does not say religion is the cause, but it does say religion is not the solution and suggests that moving away from religion may be the answer. \n \n \nAs said there is no truly secular society to compare.( China is the only secular society)\n\n \n Not really, but closer than many.\n \n \n \nI'll repeat part of a previous post that you ignored \n \n 'Japan the land of Karoshi,the drudgery of the salaryman and the huge consumption of schoolgirl rape bongo movies not to mention its extremely high suicide rate is a beacon to all of us who live in christian democracies.\n Japan who believed their emperor was related to the sun and they were supermen owes more to the Allies crushing it and the huge amount of capital injected into it( along with modern American business practices) to its lack of religion.\n\n \n And I will repost 1 of my responses to your claims about Japan. The other half I have already again responded to in the begining of this post\n \n Japan grants full religious freedom, allowing minority religions such as Christianity, Islam and Sikhism to be practiced. Figures that state 84% to 96% of Japanese adhere to Shinto and Buddhism are not based on self-identification but come primarily from birth records, following a longstanding practice of officially associating a family line with a local Buddhist temple or Shinto shrine.[2][3][4][5] About 70 percent of Japanese profess no religious membership,[6][7] according to Johnstone (1993:323), 84% of the Japanese claim no personal religion. And according to Demerath (2001:138), 64% do not believe in God, and 55% do not believe in Buddha.[8] Japanese streets are decorated on Tanabata, Obon and Christmas\n \n \nWithout the Americans rebuilding it and forcing pacifism onto it they would be cutting themselves in half with katanas.\n Once again Christian America forced its values onto Japan and protected it since WW2 thats why it is a stable country.'\n\n \n So which is it? Japan is not eligable because it share no common ground with western european democracies or the US has replaced Japenese culture by forcing US values and systems onto them which is the only reason the country has any stability.\n \n \nIf you cant see that including a society that has never believed in Western Christian morals should not be included in a survey that asks the question..would more people believing in Western Christian beliefs( creator God etc) and morals be beneficial to that society then you are more dense than you realise.\n\n \n Sorry I can't help that you consider Japan incapable of moving past the sterotype Samurai of feudal period. Your just determined to keep Japan out of the study even if it means contradicting yourself. That they practice a democracy similiar to the West, that they are a first world country, that people's beliefs are not surpressed by government are all reasons that qualify Japan. \n \n From the study\n \n Although they are by no means utopias, the populations of secular democracies are clearly able to govern themselves and maintain societal cohesion. Indeed, the data examined in this study demonstrates that only the more secular, pro-evolution democracies have, for the first time in history, come closest to achieving practical \"cultures of life\" that feature low rates of lethal crime, juvenile-adult mortality, sex related dysfunction, and even abortion. The least theistic secular developed democracies such as Japan, France, and Scandinavia have been most successful in these regards. The non-religious, pro-evolution democracies contradict the dictum that a society cannot enjoy good conditions unless most citizens ardently believe in a moral creator. The widely held fear that a Godless citizenry must experience societal disaster is therefore refuted.\n \n \n I am sure you will have something creative in the way of a response that will clearly show, at least in your mind, the validity of your position. Can't wait I am looking forward to a good chuckle. Don't forget to throw in one of those mocks they are always entertaining coming from you.",

The study was not trying to establish is a secular society better than a religious one. It was a response to the statements that society can not survive without religion. This shows that the success of society is not necessarily dependent on religion.\n \n \nLifestyle and financial success was not at the core of the study because the study was flawed by not recognising that lifestyle and financial success was the reason why european democracies became secular..not the other way round.......waving it away wont make it go away pappy.\n\n \n I am sorry but that just doesn't fly. If wealth were a factor in whether people are religious or not there are plenty of times in history where prosperous nations remained religious. Lifestyle changes drifting away from religious values are going to be caused by a decline in religious practice. If people are practicing their religion they don't adopt a lifestyle that takes them away from it. They are either unsatisfied with their religion, which can be from any number of causes or they no longer believe it's relevant and/or true.\n \n But your again not argueing what the focus of the study is about. Your not disproving the study by saying it's flawed because it doesn't address something it wasn't intended to.\n \n \n \nThe fact that there is NO truly European democracy is very important.\n It allows the survey to speculate far more than if it were honest and include one..China.\n\n \n What are you talking about? So what if there are no true European democratic governments. The study is using nations whose governments are are similar which is all that is necessary for the purpose of it and which is why a country like China is not included. It has nothing in common with the other nations along with the other reasons stated in the study. \n \n \n I will let you clarify China is a Democracy, I think you made a mistake there.\n \n \nIncidentally what is the abortion rate in China pappy?\n\n \n Numerically one of the highest as a percentage of population though lower than many of the nations in the survey. You only looked at the numerical number didn't you. ooops\n \n \nIgnoring the points and cut and pasting does not enhance your argument.\n\n \n No it proves my argument by using evidence. Will you provide anything to support your claims some time soon?\n \n \nThe rest of your post asks questions that are already there in the post you are replying to.\n\n \n Stop repeating the same bogus arguments and I will stop refuting them with the same evidence. Sounds like a win win to me.\n \n \nI cant be bothered to repeat points that you dont seem to understand and ask questions that require me to repeat the point you dont understand.\n\n \n This coming from the person who has yet to actually address the questions raised in the study and that I have repeatedly asked you that you somehow never get to. Instead you keep making it about something else. \n \n \nI admire special needs teachers far more than I did before ' debating ' with you.\n\n \n Ahh yes bitter table for 1. Your too amusing to be considered insulting. \n \n \n\nThe study is not definitive one , without a clear conclusion and admits that it cannot make a clear conclusion...perfect for third rate intellectuals to make a third rate conclusion[/QUOTE]\n \n Nor has it or anyone said it was. Yet it does have conclusions you can't miss them they are under the title headings\n \n RESULTS\n and below that is one that says \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n \n You keep thinking your doing good, it builds your confidence.
