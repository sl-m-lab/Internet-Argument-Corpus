   "I'm starting this thread with a horrific story from the New York Times:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/12/national/12priest.html\n \n January 12, 2006\n Trial Opens in Prison Slaying of Ex-Priest \n By PAM BELLUCK\n WORCESTER, Mass., Jan. 11 - The murder of John J. Geoghan, a defrocked priest, in 2003 by an inmate in state prison was a shocking and almost surreal d\u00e9nouement to one of the darkest chapters of the sexual abuse crisis in the Roman Catholic Church.\n \n Mr. Geoghan's violent death in the most secure prison in Massachusetts was to some an appalling failure of the state to protect one of its most despised inmates. To others it was a horrible but justified retribution against Mr. Geoghan, one of the most reviled priests named in the abuse scandal, accused of molesting some 150 children in several parishes over three decades.\n \n Now, the man who admits he killed Mr. Geoghan, Joseph L. Druce, is having his day in court, and for anyone watching the trial, it is hard to figure out where to put one's sympathies - with the murder victim or the man who killed him.\n \n Mr. Druce, 40, is pleading not guilty by reason of mental illness. His lawyer, John LaChance, does not dispute the details of the case. Prosecutors say Mr. Druce followed Mr. Geoghan into his cell at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center on Aug. 23, 2003, and jammed the cell door shut with a nail clipper and a ripped-up copy of \"The Cross and the Switchblade,\" a book about a minister who transformed the lives of teenage gang members by introducing them to Christianity.\n \n Mr. Druce then tied Mr. Geoghan's hands with a T-shirt, wrapped stretched-out socks around Mr. Geoghan's neck, tightened them with a shoe, and then jumped up and down on his body.\n \n According to testimony by corrections officers on Wednesday, Mr. Druce later told them he \"did it for the children,\" to stop Mr. Geoghan, 68, from molesting more boys when he got out of prison.\n \n Mr. Geoghan was serving 6 years of a 9-to-10-year sentence for groping a boy in a swimming pool, and Mr. Druce told law enforcement authorities that he had heard Mr. Geoghan talking about plans to assault more children upon his release. Mr. Druce also signed a card waiving his Miranda rights \"the Reverend Joseph Druce.\"\n \n Mr. LaChance suggested Wednesday that Mr. Druce's behavior was evidence of insanity, saying \"he began fantasizing about being an individual who would save the kids and save the world.\"\n \n The prosecutor, Lawrence Murphy, suggested the opposite, that the fact that \"Mr. Druce was planning to kill John Geoghan\" showed that he was not insane.\n \n Mr. Druce is serving a life sentence without parole for beating and strangling a driver who he said made a sexual advance toward him when he was hitchhiking in 1988. He unsuccessfully tried an insanity defense in that case in 1989, and his lawyer in that case emphasized Mr. Druce's highly troubled background, including serious behavior problems, drug use, a mother who did not want him and a father who was abusive to his mother.\n \n Mr. LaChance referred to that background Wednesday, saying that Mr. Druce was \"like a little puppy you beat and beat,\" adding, \"Eventually the puppy strikes back when it is old enough and big enough.\"\n \n At the time of Mr. Geoghan's slaying, Mr. Druce's father, Dana Smiledge, said Mr. Druce also had white supremacist leanings - a hatred of gay people, Jews and blacks.\n \n Mr. Geoghan's murder not only stunned victims of abuse by priests, but also ignited a state investigation into the prison system. Several correction officials were removed, including the correction commissioner. \n \n The investigation found that only one guard was monitoring the 26-inmate unit at the time Mr. Druce slipped into Mr. Geoghan's cell and that the cell doors had been left open while the inmates were taking their lunch trays to a collection point.\n \n Mr. Geoghan was jailed in early 2002 and moved from a medium-security prison in Concord to the maximum-security Souza-Baranowski prison in Shirley in early 2003 after complaining that he felt harassed by guards and afraid for his safety.\n \n The state investigation said that Mr. Geoghan was indeed mistreated by guards in Concord and that he was inappropriately transferred to Shirley, where he was put in a wing for inmates who needed to be separated from the general prison population. But some of them were violent offenders, and many were younger than the frail Mr. Geoghan.\n \n Mr. Druce was transferred there not long afterward because he, too, had felt unsafe in his previous prison, where he had become a jailhouse informant, his lawyer said. Mr. Druce had changed his name, from Darrin Smiledge, because he was afraid of his prison enemies.\n \n Mr. LaChance said that Mr. Druce had been delusional in the past, pretending he was a rich person who owned yachts and million-dollar houses, and subscribing to Robb Report, the luxury magazine, at his previous prison. He said Mr. Druce fantasized that if he killed Mr. Geoghan \"he would be someone like a rich person with a yacht.\"\n \n Mr. Druce, who has previously held up photographs and demonstrated other showy behavior in court, was medicated Wednesday with Ritalin and possibly other drugs, Mr. LaChance said. He made a thumbs up sign to several reporters, but otherwise seemed less attention-seeking. If his defense is successful, Mr. Druce is likely to be moved to a psychiatric institution.",

   "Surely the fact that the article mentions that a lot of people can symphasise with him and understand his actions means its clearly not a product of insanity - if the motive was to prevent Geohan from removing the colour purple, one leopard at a time, or more reasonably because Druce was convinced that Geohan would go after his family in 'revenge' for some imagined act then it would make sense.\n \n I think its a bit of a push to assume that everyone with an abusive childhood has been sexually abused, far more likely Druce was just more violent due to likely being the subject of violence and decided to try and make up for his actions and possibly 'spare any other children from a miserable childhood like his', if that.\n \n I think you've got to be mentally ill pretty much to not grasp right and wrong to the extent mentioned, children don't live in a complete vacuum in their parents house and adults certainly don't.

Are you claiming that the illegitimacy rate is lower post-feminism than it was before feminism? If so, you're living in Wonderland. \n \n\n According to the most recent data released by the Center for Health Statistics at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), illegitimacy continues to rise rapidly while marriage continues to decline across the U.S.\n \n According to the recently released HHS data, out-of-wedlock births represented 31 percent of all births in the U.S. in 1993--up from 30.1 percent just a year earlier. That rapid increase in illegitimacy of nearly one percentage point in a single year follows the pattern of increasing illegitimacy that has occurred since the beginning of the War on Poverty in 1965. In that year, 7.7 percent of children were born out-of-wedlock. By 1993 the number had risen fourfold.\n \n The percentage of out-of-wedlock births is increasing rapidly for both whites and blacks. Among whites in 1993, 23.6 percent of births took place out of wedlock, up from 11 percent in 1980. Among blacks, 68.7 percent of births were out of wedlock in 1993, up from 58 percent in 1980.\n \n Reflecting the general erosion of marriage in U.S. society, the HHS data also show that the absolute number of children born within marriage fell in the last reported year. In 1992, 2.84 million children were born to married couples; by 1993 the number had declined to 2.76 million. \n \n By contrast, the number of children born out of wedlock rose from 1.22 million in 1992 to 1.24 million in 1993. The increase in illegitimate births reflects both an increase in the number of women who are not married as well as an increase in fertility among unmarried women.\n \n The HHS data show that the fertility rate (births per 1,000 women of childbearing age) has fallen for American women in general over the past two decades. But the fertility rate for unmarried women has risen sharply during the same period. In fact, the fertility rate for unmarried women has nearly doubled in the last quarter-century, rising from 26.4 births per 1,000 unmarried women (ages 15 to 44) in 1970 to 45.3 births per 1,000 unmarried women (ages 15 to 44) in 1993.http://www.heartland.org/archives/ia/janfeb96/welfare.htm\n \n\n \n Now, if the case of fireFIGHTERS, I do believe that a woman ought to betall and very strong to be a fireFIGHTER, but I see no reason why a small woman with a gun couldn't be a police OFFICER or a soldier.

   "I don't think I ever claimed that the illegitimacy rate is lower post-feminism. The illegitimacy rate is about the same. The only difference now is that it isn't hidden away as it was some 30 or 40 years ago and before that.\n\n \n You're dead wrong. The illegitimacy rate is MUCH higher post-feminism. I included the data and you're STILL making false claims. That takes brass...er, nevermind. :) \n Here it is again, just in case you missed it.\n \"According to the recently released HHS data, out-of-wedlock births represented 31 percent of all births in the U.S. in 1993--up from 30.1 percent just a year earlier. That rapid increase in illegitimacy of nearly one percentage point in a single year follows the pattern of increasing illegitimacy that has occurred since the beginning of the War on Poverty in 1965. In that year, 7.7 percent of children were born out-of-wedlock. By 1993 the number had risen fourfold.\"\n Now, I'm sure that you will continue to not let the facts get in the way of your fairy tale, but for those of us that do know the facts, you're contention won't fly. Sorry. :xbanghead \n \n\n That kind of situation has happened to men as well and I think it illustrates something that was missing in their training.\n\n No, something was missing in their genetics. It goes way beyond training. I don't care how much training you have, a 110 pound woman isn't going to subdue a drugged out 200 pound man. With only rare exception, women lack the physical strength that men naturally possess. To believe otherwise is to refuse to accept basic facts of nature.\n \n\n I would think that it would be necessary for a woman to have a certain level of strength to qualify to be a soldier on the battlefield. A lot of men would be weeded out too. \n\n \n You would think so, wouldn't you. Unfortunately, the physical requirements for women have been eased. Foir example, men must do pull-ups; women just have to be able to hang on the bar!emoticon_wow \n Here: read it for yourself.\n http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA431871&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf\n And while you're at it, read what really happens to female combatants captured during war.\n \n http://cmrlink.org/WomenInCombat.asp?docID=219\n \n\n It's not a recent phenomenon. We are just more aware of poverty now and poor people are not as invisible as they formerly were.\n\n \n Poor people were invisible! Ever hear of the Depression? It was in all of the newspapers. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n Geeze, we're damned for being men-hating lesbians in the same breath as we are damned as being sluts. I've never seen \"Sex in the City,\" but coverage of the show never impressed me as indicating that the show was about feminist women.\n\n Who mentioned anything about lesbians? emoticon_confused \n As for Sex in the City, I'd suggest that you, at least, watch one episode before giving an uninformed opinion about what it \"might\" be about. emoticon_wow \n \n\n In fact, they seemed about as unfeminist as Ann Coulter--and I think she likes to brag about all the men she's shagged. She could be lying, of course, because one wonders if Coulter ever tells the truth.\n\n And this is relevent because.......? emoticon_confused",

   "About the birth rates: Just because the couples aren't married doesn't mean they aren't a couple. Also, many girls got pregnant and were then forced to marry to save face/ retain family reputation. Personally, I think that's far worse for the child, mother and husband than the child having a single-mum. Then you have to include factors such as shame and social stigma when you use the statistics. I'm sure illigitimacy were lower in the 20s, but this can be partly explained because few people would admit they had an illigitimate child.\n \n On feminism as a whole, I believe a lot of good has come from it. In its purest form, it is the belief that women and men are equal in as many ways as biologically possible. I can generally agree with this. There are some things I disagree about, because as a rule of thumb men tend to be better at some things, while women tend to be better at others, but I believe it roughly evens out.\n \n Unfortunately, at times feminism has gone too far, or, at least there was no strong male equivalent of feminism, so while rights of women increased, rights of men stayed roughly the same. Sexual harassment would be a good example. Feminists campaigned to make this illegal, but there was no male equivalent to raise awareness about women sexually harassing guys. As such, women got (imo) more rights in this area\n \n That said men get the benefits of sexism more than women (imo), even if the man concerned isn't sexist.

Never mind that I was the one who recruited her from a former company that we both worked for and brought her into my group via a promotion. emoticon_wow \n When I heard what she was spreading, I went to our HR Director and told him that she had two choices. 1. put in a formal complaint that I discriminated against her because she was a woman or 2. shut the Hell up and apologize to me for her unfounded statements. She chose the latter, admitted that she was just blowing off steam and that her claim was unfounded. If I hadn't have pushed for a resolution, my reputation would have been tarnished. emoticon_angry",

I believe that the term \"inner\" city is a relatively new term in useage.\n\n \n Would you prefer it if I just said city instead? Here's the statistics for blacks. IIRC, the same trend holds for whites but to a lesser extent. \n \n\n The black illegitimacy rate is close to 70 percent. Less than 40 percent of black children live in two- parent families. This produces devastating socioeconomic consequences, but is it caused by racial discrimination? Or, might it be a legacy of slavery? In the early 1900s, black illegitimacy was a tiny fraction of today's rate. Roughly 75 percent, and in New York City 85 percent, of black children lived in two-parent households. The fact of lower illegitimacy and more intact families, at a time when blacks were much closer to slavery and faced greater discrimination, suggests that today's unprecedented illegitimacy and weak family structure has nothing to do with discrimination and slavery. It's explained better by promiscuity and irresponsibility, and as such it's not a civil rights problem. \n Family Secrets \n TownHall.com ^ | Wednesday, November 20, 2002 | by Walter Williams \n\n \n In 1954, <20% of blacks were born out of wedlock; in 1997 ~70% were.\n Reference: Table 4\n http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.14891/pub_detail.asp\n \n The statistics are EVERYWHERE.
