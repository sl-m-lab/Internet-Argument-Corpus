But people accept that the earth revolves around the sun readily while condemning evolution and the big bang because it doesnt follow their view of how the world was created.\n \n Edit: Almost forgot to say something.

Just remember there are still parts of the evolutionary puzzle that we dont understand yet but that doesnt mean we have to throw out the entire theory.\n\n \n The common view of evolution is that it's processes explain all improvement over time in lifeforms.\n \n I pointed out a concept called irreducible complexity, now if you google this you will find many articles claiming to debunk the idea.\n \n I have read many of them and can assure you they are written without understanding exactly what it is they are refuting, a symptom shared in some degree by members of this forum.\n \n A irreducibly complex system is said to be one which has several parts all of which are crucial to the function.\n \n To be extremely brief it claims there is a difference between improving a function and creating a function.\n \n The reason for this should become clear once you consider the mechanism of evolution which is Random mutation filtered by natural selection.\n \n For evolution to guide any genetic movement every step of that movement must give benefit to the organism.\n \n So when exactly will natural selection stop working?\n \n Never, it doesn't \"stop working\" but we can say (by definition) that it will not move DNA in a direction that does not have benefit all along the way.\n \n Therefore if one attempts to explain a system using evolution one must explain how it first began to function.\n \n The gist of the argument is that there are no beneficiary intermediates between a non-functional/different function sequence of DNA and a novel function accomplishing sequence except by chance.\n \n The conclusion is that every novel function even if just it's most primitive form must have formed fully in a single mutation else a series with the exact same odds of the former.\n \n This argument was not defeated but the debate was shifted, after it was finally admitted that this was the case, that there is a fundamental difference between evolving a fluke from a limb (modification with constant intermediate benefit) and evolving mussels (novel) the last tag of the argument \"except by pure chance\" was latched on to.\n \n It was claimed that the evolutionary mechanism was not required to form novel function in any kind of predictable or methodical way, in fact the only way natural selection comes into this new view of evolution is to preserve a function once it appeared.\n \n While this appears conceptually similar to the preserving of a sequence of small mutations it is not.\n \n For every base pair changed in a single mutation the number of possible outcomes grows very fast.\n \n Preserving 2 or 3 base pairs that help an organism is entirely the same as preserving 200 or 300 base pairs, but if natural selection is not given a chance to choose until the end it does not have the same effect as the gradual change, where it is allowed to guide movement by rejecting directions which are not beneficial.\n \n It is the analogous to stopping and asking directions at every turn in a maze as opposed to randomly turning corners.\n \n If every time you ask you get an answer \"warmer\" \"colder\" you are almost infinitely more likely to find the prize than the random turning, however if you asked for directions right in front of the prize you would get \"very warm\"\n \n The last answer does not mean you got there with help, it does not mean you were guided.\n \n I called this analysis of genetic movement guided mutation.\n \n This however is a tangential debate on whether random chance could have produced life, it is similar to the origin debate in it's premises.\n \n It is however certain that no matter what the out come of this debate evolution has already been debunked as a producer of novel function, therefore it cannot be a theory of the advancement of life but only a theory of the refinement and repurposing of life.\n \n and those are the highlights emoticon_xhoho",

He's become a celebrity, and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way, without fear of discrimination, academic or otherwise.

It is a subtle diversion from the subject of the IC which is the formation event and is inconsequential to the concept of IC. Here I explore the difference with the concept of HIC. Every article I have read attempting to explain why IC is not a problem for evolution uses the basic example of an HIC system improving and then becoming an IC system, this transition is not the one which matters to Behe or I. it is confusing unless you have read Darwin's blackbox and know exactly why IC is significant.\n \n 2) Lucky for Behe neither does the real world, if coopting happens it's because of pure chance.\n \n \n This has been pointed out to you, yet you fail to acknowledge it.\n\n I would not call refuting it every time failing to acknowledge.\n \n \nBecause of those two processes, irreducible complex structures can be shown to evolve naturally.\n\n The second is not a process it is a possibility, the first is a process that cannot take place between functional domains and wouldn't matter if it did.\n \n \nTQ doesn't, and of course he'll tell you that I don't.\n\n I have noticed he seems content to drop a Ad Hominem neglecting to actually argue.\n \n \nRead \"The Edge of Evolution\", or \"Darwin's Black Box\" sometime. :)\n\n Darwin's black box is overflowing with simple analogies so there is no excuse on ground of technical incompetence!\n \n \nSome irreducible complex structures, but not all of them. For atheists, that's good enough.\n\n Here I have to disagree, no one can show anything evolved naturally without observing it happen or some equivalent piece of evidence.\n \n More importantly though no one has even given a proposed natural explanation that would produce any IC system except pure luck.\n \n A double knock out of \"I didn't see it happen and I don't know why it would happen\"\n \n Do not be fooled by the attempted rebuttals by people like ken miller.\n \n They have not debunked IC the concept so they cannot and have not debunked any specific example of IC.\n \n An appeal to odds is not a solution, a large scale strawman has been setup. The burden of proof they place on IC is to show that something could not have physically happened.\n \n Consider that for a second, for it to be physically impossible there has to be a scientific law preventing it's formation.\n \n These things are built all the time all around us, no such law exists.\n \n It is not physically impossible.\n \n In fact a cell could have flown together from random particle collisions.\n \n You can then see how ridiculous it is to come up with a counter argument like \"IC just says none of the parts are functional, and clearly there is nothing stopping lots of different parts from combining and forming a new machine.\"\n \n Of course there is nothing stopping that, nothing causing it either.\n \n It's not science anymore if it just means \"this isn't impossible\", it must be \"this happens because of... and in this manner\"\n \n \n...As the number of required parts increases, the difficulty of gradually putting the system together skyrockets, and the likelihood of indirect scenarios plummets.\" \n\n Right this has to do with the \"by pure chance\" tag as it's all that's left for the evolutionist to fight with.\n \n Not only are the odds of a single system outside of rational consideration but considering the fact that it must have happened thousands of times at least you are looking at one word despite all the trials and possible functional sequences: Practically impossible.",

As for your 'religious authors' being respected.. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about. \n \n \n\n Some irreducible complex structures, but not all of them. For atheists, that&#8217;s good enough. But it&#8217;s not good enough for everyone. In Behe&#8217;s words; &#8220;&#8230;as biochemists have begun to examine apparently simple structures like cilia and flagella, they have discovered staggering complexity, with dozens or even hundreds of precisely tailored parts. &#8230;As the number of required parts increases, the difficulty of gradually putting the system together skyrockets, and the likelihood of indirect scenarios plummets.&#8221; Behe wrote this in 1996, and since then it has only gotten worse for the atheists, no matter how much they dance.\n\n \n As for Irreducible complex structures, one thing you have yet to understand, even though it has been explained to you at least a dozen times, is there are two methods for ic structures to evolve naturally, and indeed it has been shown this is the case\n \n 1) Scaffolding, where the 'supporting structure' no longer is needed, and then eventually gets removed.\n 2) Co-opting of existing pieces that have a different function for a new purpose.\n \n Behe , and you also ignore the fact of 'incremental development'. I am sorry, but his understanding of that kind of process is very lacking (or at least his writing of it). It's really a simple concept, but it seems to go over Behe's \n head, since he didn't address it when people pointed it out as a flaw in his first book, nor did he address it, despite having it pointed out to him for many many years in his second book. Until he addresses that subject, his entire thesis is terribly flawed.",

   "1) Scaffolding is a process for making non-crucial parts crucial, not for forming crucial parts from irrelevant or non-existent DNA. It is a subtle diversion from the subject of the IC which is the formation event and is inconsequential to the concept of IC. Here I explore the difference with the concept of HIC. Every article I have read attempting to explain why IC is not a problem for evolution uses the basic example of an HIC system improving and then becoming an IC system, this transition is not the one which matters to Behe or I. it is confusing unless you have read Darwin's blackbox and know exactly why IC is significant.\n\n \n Freedom, I don't know why you still have the definition of scaffolding wrong, but you really need to correct yourself before you continue to refute something you obviously don't understand. \n \n You know the temporary structure that is erected to construct buildings, to paint, etc etc. That is what this concept is analogous to. Scaffolding results when you have an evolved structure, not IC, where multiple parts are replaced by more efficient parts and maybe fewer parts and then the less efficient parts are removed. Any IC structure can be explained this way. We don't need to develop exact paths that the scaffolding took. If IC is a concept then it can be defeated by a concept. \n \n Working backwards, you can take any IC system, add a redundant part or many parts that create redundancy, take away the modern part you are replacing and by doing a few iterations of this you can create a non-IC system. A non-IC system can obviously evolve, but now run the film back forward again and what do you know, you have created an IC system through scaffolding. Best of all, not giant leaps were required as the concept of IC contends. I can imagine this process for any system that fits the definition of IC. \n \n Please stop misusing the concept. Or, if you refuse to acknowledge what it actually means, don't use it at all!",

I'm permitted to have \"theories\" about it. emoticon_xangel\n \n When the word \"theory\" is applied to a very wide range of subjects, It's not fair to label someone who questions one theory a rejecter of all theories.

You haven't gotten in over your head - most who post here don't know much about science. TQ doesn't, and of course he'll tell you that I don't. There's a big difference between science, and the creation/ evolution controversy. Many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel \"intellectually fulfilled\", to discredit religion. Some of the best reading on the creation/evolution controversy isn't written by scientists, but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy, without confusing it with too much detail. Michael Ruse and Bradley Monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject. Religious authors, practically too many to name. William Dembski, David Berlinski, Phillip Johnson, Cornelius Hunter, many others. You would do well to read anything by any of these people. Far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists, like Richard Dawkins. He's become a celebrity, and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way, without fear of discrimination, academic or otherwise.

For atheists, that's good enough. \n\n \n \nHere I have to disagree, no one can show anything evolved naturally without observing it happen or some equivalent piece of evidence.\n \n More importantly though no one has even given a proposed natural explanation that would produce any IC system except pure luck.\n \n\n \n I agree with you, but the reason I worded it that way is because one of the heavies at EvC said that if they can show just one IC system to evolve naturally, then it completely debunks IC for all systems. I don't automatically accept it when I hear claims that they've shown one, but I'm not a scientist so I sometimes give them the benefit of the doubt. It doesn't change my belief that some IC systems could be too mathematically complex to naturally allow what simpler systems could naturally allow. \n \n \n \nNo, real information doesn't convince you at all, not when you have THE BIBLE. \n\n \n I was referring to, and responding to another poster who was referring to \"common speech\" and word usage. Where you get \"THE BIBLE\" from that I have no idea. \n \n \nHowever, there is a difference between a scientific theory, and how the word 'theory' is used by the layperson. \n\n \n And I would like to know why that is. I asked the question in post #2 and got no answer. Are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that it's hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists? Since they share the same society, put their pants on one leg at a time in the same way, eat, sleep, and share economic processes in comparable ways, it seems to me it would be beneficial for them and laypersons both to understand each other when they use identical terms. (like the word, \"theory\") \n \n \nThat is where you mess up, and apply the logical fallacy of equivocation. You are also doing what is known as 'willful ignorance'. \n\n \n And you do what many atheists do when they don't know what else to say, you clang the fallacy bell. \n \n \nIt is very obvious you are not 'in' science' understand science, care about information, or education, because that might upset your precious belief in the BIBLE. \n\n \n Link me to where I've referred to the Bible in this thread, and we'll discuss it. \n \n \nWow, a web site called 'hot air' accuses obama of wanting to 'control the people'. \n\n \n Uh no, it reported where a politician in Obama's controlling party actually said it, with recorded proof. \n \n \nThis sounds very paranoid, and far\n removed from reality. \n\n \n It is reality, because a Democrat ally of Obama's really said it. \n \n \n Do you need your tin foil beanie yet? \n\n \n You're immune from committing fallacies aren't you - must be a benefit of being a parrot of the scientific community. \n \n \nAs for Irreducible complex structures, one thing you have yet to understand, even though it has been explained to you at least a dozen times, is there are two methods for ic structures to evolve naturally, and indeed it has been shown this is the case \n\n \n A dozen times? Link me to just one, or it may be time to awaken the liars corner forum. \n \n \n \nYou know the temporary structure that is erected to construct buildings, to paint, etc etc. That is what this concept is analogous to. Scaffolding results when you have an evolved structure, not IC, where multiple parts are replaced by more efficient parts and maybe fewer parts and then the less efficient parts are removed. Any IC structure can be explained this way. \n\n \n When did the concept of scaffolding originate? Before or after Behe's book of 1996? A quick internet search doesn't find anything about that for me. I'm also wondering if one person is given credit for the concept. \n \n \nWe don't need to develop exact paths that the scaffolding took. \n\n \n Why not? Can't more scientific things be learned if we try to find those paths? \n \n \nIf IC is a concept then it can be defeated by a concept. \n\n \n So the only purpose of the concept of scaffolding is to defeat IC? \n \n \nWorking backwards, you can take any IC system, add a redundant part or many parts that create redundancy, take away the modern part you are replacing and by doing a few iterations of this you can create a non-IC system. A non-IC system can obviously evolve, but now run the film back forward again and what do you know, you have created an IC system through scaffolding. Best of all, not giant leaps were required as the concept of IC contends. I can imagine this process for any system that fits the definition of IC. \n\n \n So that's it - there's nothing else to study on the subject? The process you describe naturally takes long periods of time. Do you wonder if, during this process, information/health/life could lie dormant for long periods of time, or if it would have to make some of its changes close to the time when other things changed, or when the system became operational? In mid-2001, the Human Genome Project and Celera Genomics jointly presented the true nature and complexity of the digital code inherent in DNA. We now understand that each human DNA molecule is comprised of chemical bases arranged in approximately 3 billion precise sequences. Even the DNA molecule for the single-celled bacterium, E. coli, contains enough information to fill all the books in any of the world's largest libraries. ID proponents are often accused of saying \"goddidit, that settles it, stop looking\", and it seems that atheists do that quite often as well. Can you quote any ID proponent saying what you said, that \"we don't need to develop exact paths...\"? Behe can describe exploration of paths, that aren't being explored to any great extent now. (too religious, don't-cha-know :p) In his words; \"Since the simplest possible design scenario posits a single cell -formed billions of years ago - that already contained all information to produce descendant organisms, studies could test this scenario by attempting to calculate how much DNA would be required to code the information (keeping in mind that much of the information might be implicit) lf DNA alone is insufficient, studies could be initiated to see if information could be stored in the cell in other ways - for example, as positional information. Other work could focus on whether larger, compound systems (containing two or more irreducibly complex systems) could have developed gradually or whether there are compounded irreducibilities.\" \n \n \"Blind, purposeless, happenstance nature did it, that settles it, stop looking\"? Is that your answer? Is the type of study Behe describes something for atheists to be afraid of?",

I promise you, nothing you say will matter to me, any rational readers, and the truth except reasoned logical discourse.\n \n The only pattern here is purposeful ignorance, yours.\n \n\n define 'advancement of life'. How do you 'measure' the advancement of life.\n\n Alright, looks like we got another one. That wasn't an argument, arguments have support for their conclusions, this conclusion had support only in other threads.\n \n This was just repeating the conclusion from my previous arguments in a perverted yes/no battle game thing with T.Q. and other people who don't feel they are able to actually argue with me.\n \n I would say the advancement of life could be pretty well defined as the formation of new functions as opposed to repurposement and refinement of previous ones.\n \n The vagueness with which evolution is taught and spoken of gives great sanction to the idea that there are no distinctions of this type.\n \n It is intentional that you are to believe that \"change is just change, there is only one kind of change in species\" that there is only one kind of \"improvement\" and since advancement is improvement it is just change and that happens all the time right?\n \n When one looks at life with clean eyes you will see that you cannot modify any given system to do any given task.\n \n A knife can be many things, it has many purposes and can be improved and specialized for many many things; An airplane is not one of them.\n \n \nFreedom, I don't know why you still have the definition of scaffolding wrong, but you really need to correct yourself before you continue to refute something you obviously don't understand. \n\n It is the addition of components to a functioning system that allow previously necessary parts to be removed thereby causing these additional components which previously were only an improvement to be necessary for the system to function.\n \n How Can Evolution Cause Irreducibly Complex Systems?\n \n I once thought the term was extended to include entire systems themselves, thanks to peeling and you I now know they have a special term for that, co-option.\n \n Co-option is like scaffolding for a system that does not exist but I am not calling it that so we can debate without terminology problems.\n \n \nYou know the temporary structure that is erected to construct buildings, to paint, etc etc. That is what this concept is analogous to. Scaffolding results when you have an evolved structure, not IC, where multiple parts are replaced by more efficient parts and maybe fewer parts and then the less efficient parts are removed. Any IC structure can be explained this way. We don't need to develop exact paths that the scaffolding took.

If you don't believe so, bring forth the I.C. system of your choice.\n\n Bacterial flagellum, again I have others and you can pretty much find one every other page of a biology text book but I want you to have your biggest guns.\n \n You might want this guys help.\n \nTo say 'But you don't know all the answers' is just the logical fallacy known as 'argument from ignorance'. \n\n Not for all conclusions, can you tell me the conclusion that would follow from that premise?\n \nBehe brings a system up that he claims is IC.. the pathway for evolution is discovered, and Behe trys another one.

He is simply documenting them as he analyses them; He is a scientist you know.\n \nThe concept is falsified.\n\n Note you didn't actually falsify it, you said it has been falsified and you said Behe is dishonest.\n \nDo you have a point with a bunch of links to the 'discovery org'?\n\n Yes that Behe has responded to critics of his book and argument.\n \n Do you have a point putting the name 'discovery org' in quotation marks as if the site hosting his articles had some significance?\n \nDo you want to discuss the actual data, or you just doing a 'let us overload with links and not discuss the data so I can ignore the fact they are lying through their teeth'?\n\n Do you want to discuss the actual theory and data or do you just want to ignore me until I say something you think you can refute? (didn't wait long enough)\n \n It was claimed that Michal Behe did not address attacks on his logic when they were pointed out, the number of links was to properly emphasize that he has.\n \n \nWant to take just ONE of those links, and discuss it in depth, or are you going to play \"THe Gish Gallop\" and try to overload with misinformation, and run away from each issue?\n\n You want to take one of my arguments and discuss it in depth or can you only argue against young earth creationist?\n \nWhy don't you , well, take one of hte links, distill it and tell use WHY you think it tells the truth, and then have it dissected. \n \n Or why don't I not and let any person who still believes Behe has abandoned his stance on IC go and read it themselves.\n \n \nI agree with you, but the reason I worded it that way is because one of the heavies at EvC said that if they can show just one IC system to evolve naturally, then it completely debunks IC for all systems.\n\n That is true, if IC as a concept says that a system could not evolve then that system evolving is direct evidence against IC.\n \n They think that telling a story about how it might have happened is equivalent to showing that it could have evolved naturally. Obviously they need to point out how the mechanism of evolution functioned at each step of their story to produce the effect of creating this system.\n \n I don't automatically accept it when I hear claims that they've shown one, but I'm not a scientist so I sometimes give them the benefit of the doubt. It doesn't change my belief that some IC systems could be too mathematically complex to naturally allow what simpler systems could naturally allow. \n\n Ah I see, I misunderstood you.\n \n This is different from evolving naturally.\n \n You are saying that the odds of an IC system appearing through pure chance are not all equal, some might be within the realm of possibility.\n \n Yes I completly agree with you now.\n \n I humbly ask that you use the correct terminology for this, to say it evolved is to imply that the naturalist process of random mutation filtered by natural selection produced the system as the result of a series of predicted events.\n \n It implies that there was a reason it appeared and that given the same variables it would happen again.\n \n \nWhen did the concept of scaffolding originate? Before or after Behe's book of 1996? A quick internet search doesn't find anything about that for me. I'm also wondering if one person is given credit for the concept. \n\n Good point, if you google it combined with evolution you get mostly links to people trying to debunk IC.\n \n Since some around here seem to think making up your own rules is against the rules what makes the concept of scaffolding valid while guided mutation is not?\n \n \n \n\"Blind, purposeless, happenstance nature did it, that settles it, stop looking\"? Is that your answer? Is the type of study Behe describes something for atheists to be afraid of?\n\n Very much so.\n \n Atheist in epistemology behave the exact opposite from theist (as their name suggests)\n \n If something is unexplained and a person may be tempted to say something supernatural caused it an atheist will consistently tell you that since it is unexplained it must have no cause; but more sinisterly they will say it needs no cause, simply accept it's existance and let the subject be. There are more examples of this than just evolution and it is an attack on the fundamental function of a human mind.",

   "The common view of evolution is that it's processes explain all improvement over time in lifeforms.\n \n\n Not \"improvement\", but rather diversity of lifeforms over time. \"Improvement\" is a subjective term.\n \n \nI pointed out a concept called irreducible complexity, now if you google this you will find many articles claiming to debunk the idea.\n \n I have read many of them and can assure you they are written without understanding exactly what it is they are refuting, a symptom shared in some degree by members of this forum.\n \n A irreducibly complex system is said to be one which has several parts all of which are crucial to the function.\n \n To be extremely brief it claims there is a difference between improving a function and creating a function.\n \n The reason for this should become clear once you consider the mechanism of evolution which is Random mutation filtered by natural selection.\n \n For evolution to guide any genetic movement every step of that movement must give benefit to the organism.\n\n \n Again, RM/NS only changes functions - \"improvement\" is subjective. A change can be beneficial in one environment but detrimental in a different environment. \n \n Also, evolution does not \"guide\", i.e. it does not have a target that it moves towards. \n \n Also, every step does not have to be beneficial - most genetic changes are neutral.\n \n \nSo when exactly will natural selection stop working?\n \n Never, it doesn't \"stop working\" but we can say (by definition) that it will not move DNA in a direction that does not have benefit all along the way.\n \n\n No, changes can be neutral along the way or even detrimental. A change can have negative and positive aspects at the same time - for example a protein change that lessens its efficacy but prevents infection by a prevalent virus. If that virus is then removed from the environment, we end up with a protein that is \"less beneficial\".\n \n \nTherefore if one attempts to explain a system using evolution one must explain how it first began to function.\n \n The gist of the argument is that there are no beneficiary intermediates between a non-functional/different function sequence of DNA and a novel function accomplishing sequence except by chance.\n \n The conclusion is that every novel function even if just it's most primitive form must have formed fully in a single mutation else a series with the exact same odds of the former.\n \n This argument was not defeated but the debate was shifted, after it was finally admitted that this was the case, that there is a fundamental difference between evolving a fluke from a limb (modification with constant intermediate benefit) and evolving mussels (novel) the last tag of the argument \"except by pure chance\" was latched on to.\n \n It was claimed that the evolutionary mechanism was not required to form novel function in any kind of predictable or methodical way, in fact the only way natural selection comes into this new view of evolution is to preserve a function once it appeared.\n \n While this appears conceptually similar to the preserving of a sequence of small mutations it is not.\n \n For every base pair changed in a single mutation the number of possible outcomes grows very fast.\n \n Preserving 2 or 3 base pairs that help an organism is entirely the same as preserving 200 or 300 base pairs, but if natural selection is not given a chance to choose until the end it does not have the same effect as the gradual change, where it is allowed to guide movement by rejecting directions which are not beneficial.\n \n\n \n There are a couple of problems here, on both ends of this probability argument:\n \n 1. You seem to be assuming that mutations happen base pair by base pair. In fact, this is not a common form of genetic change. You need to consider genome duplication, chromosome duplication, gene duplication, nonhomologous recombination, retrotransposons, retroviral insertions, etc. In these cases hundreds, thousands, or millions of base pairs are all \"changed\" in a single mutation.\n \n 2. You seem to be assuming that there is one single \"target\" that evolution is changing to. The odds may be overwhelming for RM/NS to account for human cytochrome C, but if you consider that there literally trillions of trillions of base pair sequences that will yield a cytochrome C protein, the \"odds\" become trivial.",

'Survival of the fittest' is really a misnomer - it is more like 'survival of the adequate'. Minimal functionality to stave off extinction works just fine from an evolutionary perspective. And don't forget that 9 out of 10 species ends up extinct. Evolution, based on random genetic mutations, guarantees many more failures than successes. It also guarantees that organisms will over-reproduce to compensate for this fact.\n \n \nThose changes are random.\n\n Yes, neutral mutations are random, just like beneficial and detrimental mutations. And whether they are neutral, beneficial, or detrimental can be different with varying environments. A 32 base pair deletion of the CCR gene produces a slightly different protein structure, which is generally neutral. But if there is an outbreak of the plague it becomes very beneficial.

The problem is attempting to calculate the odds of getting to a specific protein or function. That is not the way evolution works: there is NO 'target'.

But given that there are 100,000,000 human births each year, we can expect that each year 4 people will be born with that specific base pair change every single year.

Without both those preceding neutral mutations the beneficial mutation does not occur.\n \n Or take for example a gene duplication that simply produces more of a protein, whose excess is broken down by the cell. That is a neutral mutation with no change in functionality. But the duplicate gene is available for mutation to produce new proteins while the original gene produces the original protein. Neutral mutations provide genetic diversity, which is a good thing evolution-wise.\n \n \n \n\n Birdan: The problem is attempting to calculate the odds of getting to a specific protein or function.\n Why?\n \n Birdan: That is not the way evolution works: there is NO 'target'.\n Then there is NO prediction.\n \n\n \n Bingo!

To misrepresent evolutionist arguments in reference to single base pair mutations I would have had to change some aspect of the role single base pair mutations play in the evolutionary argument against my IC challenge.\n \n Can you find such a change?\n \n\n \n Here are excerpts from just two of many research papers one can find on the subject of gene duplication:\n \n \n\n The classical model of new gene origination by duplication has been tested by examining young duplicates of ribonuclease and other genes, and has shown a clear link between new biological traits and the evolved functions of new proteins. The expansion of protein diversity through exon shuffling and, therefore, domain shuffling has been shown to be unexpectedly common. Also, retroposition and transposable elements have been found to shape the structures of protein-coding genes in an impressive portion of mammalian genomes. Lateral gene transfer and gene fusion/fission not only have an effect on prokaryotic genomes but have also been identified in higher eukaryotic genomes.\n \n An obvious feature that is associated with the formation of new genes by these mechanisms is the rapid evolution of new sequences, structures and expression. Most of these evolutionary changes are probably adaptive changes made under positive Darwinian selection, as tests in several new genes and selective laboratory experiments in yeast and Escherichia coli have shown. These studies have also shown that new genes are not as rare as was previously thought. Furthermore, the finding that new retroposed genes in fruitflies 'escape' from the X chromosome has shown a general pattern of new gene evolution.\n https://faculty.washington.edu/wjs18/Newgenes.pdf\n \n\n \n \nThe major conclusions are as follows: (i) Almost all (<97%) of human proteins have a history of duplication of some part of their length, and (ii) most (&#8776;80%) proteins show relationships to more than one other protein in different regions, reflecting an ancient composite structure. The work was limited to the KGMV library, which consists only of proteins of known function, showing that these conclusions apply to working proteins. \n Preliminary tests with Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) and with several bacterial protein sets show similar patterns of relationship. The indication is that the ancient sequence relationships occur generally, which is to be expected if they are truly ancient. \n Almost all human genes resulted from ancient duplication ? PNAS\n \n\n \n Your model of base pair mutations building up functionality (and the corresponding odds of doing so) is not in line with current research.

   "sorry for the various random late replies everyone. i just signed up today :p\n \n i did a paper on theory vs fact vs law in school once, it went as follows:\n \n a fact is the easiest to understand, it is a fact that i am sitting down right now and have a lamp behind me. in respects to evolution and creationism, the fact is that we are alive today, on this earth with billions of other species of plants and animals living along side us. facts are everywhere. everything tangible is a fact. 'when we jump in the air, we land on the ground again' is a factual statement.\n \n a theory is something that attempts to describe the details of a fact. for example, the earth is here (fact), and the sun is up there (fact), but how do they interact? the idea that the sun and everything else revolves around the earth is a theory - valid for the time period, but we have since ruled this theory out. that doesnt mean that the earth may very well be the center of the universe, because sun-centered is just a theory, we have enough evidence to prove that it isnt, although no one who ever lived has been able to see the earth revolve around the sun. same thing with evolution. we havent seen it happen, but we have enough evidence to prove that it's true. and yea, creationism is equally a theory, valid for the 18th century.\n \n a law is the most boring, its like the laws we have in politics, only for the world around us, like everything abides by the laws of physics and the laws of chemistry, and yes, even the laws of biology. - basically when we know enough about a certain thing that we can apply a mathematical formula to it. example: laws of thermodynamics.\n \n at least thats how i would put it in my own words.",

Richard Dawkins also wrote a book called The Ancestor's Tale which is a very well written book that describes the process and timeline of evolution. excellent read, highly recommended. and his latest book, The Geatest Show on Earth subtitled Evidence for Evolution looks very good as well, and very relevant, although i havent read it yet.",
