Genetic analysis pushes the estimated origin of HIV back to between 1884 and 1924, with a more focused estimate at 1908.\n \n Previously, scientists had estimated the origin at around 1930. AIDS wasn't recognized formally until 1981 when it got the attention of public health officials in the United States.\n \n The new result is \"not a monumental shift, but it means the virus was circulating under our radar even longer than we knew,\" says Michael Worobey of the University of Arizona, an author of the new work.\n \n The results appear in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. Researchers note that the newly calculated dates fall during the rise of cities in Africa, and they suggest urban development may have promoted HIV's initial establishment and early spread.\n \n Scientists say HIV descended from a chimpanzee virus that jumped to humans in Africa, probably when people butchered chimps. Many individuals were probably infected that way, but so few other people caught the virus that it failed to get a lasting foothold, researchers say.\n \n But the growth of African cities may have changed that by putting lots of people close together and promoting prostitution, Worobey suggested. \"Cities are kind of ideal for a virus like HIV,\" providing more chances for infected people to pass the virus to others, he said.\n \n Perhaps a person infected with the AIDS virus in a rural area went to what is now Kinshasa, Congo, \"and now you've got the spark arriving in the tinderbox,\" Worobey said.\n \n Key to the new work was the discovery of an HIV sample that had been taken from a woman in Kinshasa in 1960. It was only the second such sample to be found from before 1976; the other was from 1959, also from Kinshasa.\n \n Researchers took advantage of the fact that HIV mutates rapidly. So two strains from a common ancestor quickly become less and less alike in their genetic material over time. That allows scientists to \"run the clock backward\" by calculating how long it would take for various strains to become as different as they are observed to be. That would indicate when they both sprang from their most recent common ancestor.\n \n The new work used genetic data from the two old HIV samples plus more than 100 modern samples to create a family tree going back to these samples' last common ancestor. Researchers got various answers under various approaches for when that ancestor virus appeared, but the 1884-to-1924 bracket is probably the most reliable, Worobey said.\n \n The new work is \"clearly an improvement\" over the previous estimate of around 1930, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md. His institute helped pay for the work.\n \n Fauci described the advance as \"a fine-tuning.\"\n \n Experts say it's no surprise that HIV circulated in humans for about 70 years before being recognized. An infection usually takes years to produce obvious symptoms, a lag that can mask the role of the virus, and it would have infected relatively few Africans early in its spread, they said.\n \n ___\n \n On the Net:\n \n Nature: http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081001/full/news.2008.1143.html\n",

Because it is all based on speculation and certain assumptions which must be made in order to come to any conclusions, no matter what they are. But let's assume this is correct and HIV came through Haiti from CENTRAL Africa. It still had to have entered through the homosexual community before entering the general population via random and unprotected sex, since the first outbreak in America was from within the homosexual community.\n HIV's path out of Africa: Haiti, the US then the world\n \n Two hypothetical family trees for HIV/AIDS. Research by Michael Worobey of The University of Arizona and his colleagues has shown that HIV went from Africa to Haiti and then to the U.S. (the family tree on the left.) Credit: Michael Worobey, The University of Arizona. This graphic may only be used in conjunction with a news story about the study described in this news release.\n The AIDS virus entered the United States via Haiti, probably arriving in just one person in about 1969, earlier than previously believed, according to new research.\n \n After the virus, HIV-1, entered the U.S., it flourished and spread worldwide.\n \n \"Our results show that the strain of virus that spawned the U.S. AIDS epidemic probably arrived in or around 1969. That is earlier than a lot of people had imagined,\" said senior author Michael Worobey.\n \n The research is the first to definitively pinpoint when and from where HIV-1 entered the United States and shows that most HIV/AIDS viruses in the U.S. descended from a single common ancestor. The actual ancestral HIV entered the U.S. long before the storied \"Patient Zero,\" Worobey said.\n \n \"Haiti was the stepping stone the virus took when it left central Africa and started its sweep around the world,\" said Worobey, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at The University of Arizona in Tucson. \"Once the virus got to the U.S., then it just moved explosively around the world.\"\n I also believe that it's a huge leap to assume that the US was the jumping off point after Haiti for HIV to take on its journey around the World. As many Americans visit the rest of the World, as foreigners visit here after all. It seems a real leap to believe they can go back 30 years and determine directionality of the virus. And finally, let's not forget what \"hypothetical\" means.\n Noun 1. hypothetical - a hypothetical possibility, circumstance, statement, proposal, situation, etc.; \"consider the following, just as a hypothetical\"\n hypothesis, theory, possibility - a tentative insight into the natural world; a concept that is not yet verified but that if true would explain certain facts or phenomena; \"a scientific hypothesis that survives experimental testing becomes a scientific theory\"; \"he proposed a fresh theory of alkalis that later was accepted in chemical practices\"\n Adj. 1. hypothetical - based primarily on surmise rather than adequate evidence; \"theories about the extinction of dinosaurs are still highly conjectural\"; \"the supposed reason for his absence\"; \"suppositious reconstructions of dead languages\"; \"hypothetical situation\"\n conjectural, hypothetic, suppositional, suppositious, supposititious, divinatory, supposed\n theoretic, theoretical - concerned primarily with theories or hypotheses rather than practical considerations; \"theoretical science\"\n Based on WordNet 3.0, Farlex clipart collection. \u00a9 2003-2008 Princeton University, Farlex Inc.\n So tell foundit that he can jump up and down and repeat himself a hundred times but that doesn't make this hypothetical any more absolute or factual than his belief that the Moon is made out of cheese. It only confirms for objective observers how irrational he is. emoticon_rolleyes",

It still had to have entered through the homosexual community before entering the general population via random and unprotected sex, since the first outbreak in America was from within the homosexual community.\n\n And here, Archie makes an obvious ASSUMPTION, insisting it has to be true.\n While it is true that the HIV problem did have a majority creation amongst gays, to assume \"it had to have entered\" through gays is not founded.\n It obviously did find a foothold and early means of propagation, but that's about it...\n \n \n \nHIV's path out of Africa: Haiti, the US then the world\n Two hypothetical family trees for HIV/AIDS. Research by Michael Worobey of The University of Arizona and his colleagues has shown that HIV went from Africa to Haiti and then to the U.S. (the family tree on the left.) Credit: Michael Worobey, The University of Arizona. This graphic may only be used in conjunction with a news story about the study described in this news release.\n The AIDS virus entered the United States via Haiti, probably arriving in just one person in about 1969, earlier than previously believed, according to new research.\n After the virus, HIV-1, entered the U.S., it flourished and spread worldwide.\n \"Our results show that the strain of virus that spawned the U.S. AIDS epidemic probably arrived in or around 1969. That is earlier than a lot of people had imagined,\" said senior author Michael Worobey.\n The research is the first to definitively pinpoint when and from where HIV-1 entered the United States and shows that most HIV/AIDS viruses in the U.S. descended from a single common ancestor. The actual ancestral HIV entered the U.S. long before the storied \"Patient Zero,\" Worobey said.\n \"Haiti was the stepping stone the virus took when it left central Africa and started its sweep around the world,\" said Worobey, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at The University of Arizona in Tucson. \"Once the virus got to the U.S., then it just moved explosively around the world.\"I also believe that it's a huge leap to assume that the US was the jumping off point after Haiti for HIV to take on its journey around the World.\n\n Why?\n Just cause your mind can't fathom it being true?\n \n \n \nAs many Americans visit the rest of the World, as foreigners visit here after all. It seems a real leap to believe they can go back 30 years and determine directionality of the virus.\n\n You obviously don't understand anything about the capabilities or techniques of disease epidemiology.\n \n \n \nAnd finally, let's not forget what \"hypothetical\" means.\n\n And there it is...\n I swear. If a paper mentions the word \"hypothetical\" even ONCE, then people like Archie will assume that every single part of the paper is \"hypothetical\".\n The paper referred to the \"two hypothetical family trees\".\n The paper refers to them as \"hypothetical\" because there are two possibilities.\n Two \"hypothetical\" alternatives.\n Not \"Three\" hypothetical, or \"Four\" hypothetical, but TWO hypotheticals.\n \n \n \nSo tell foundit that he can jump up and down and repeat himself a hundred times but that doesn't make this hypothetical any more absolute or factual than his belief that the Moon is made out of cheese. It only confirms for objective observers how irrational he is. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Archie, you keep trying to move the goalposts and you fail miserably at it.\n My point was simple. I said it repeatedly.\n HIV-1 ORIGINATED IN AFRICA.\n THAT part is NOT \"hypothetical\".\n Let me repeat that.\n The fact that HIV-1 originated in Africa IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL.\n \n Like I said above, you have found a spot in the article where it says \"hypothetical\", and therefore you try to pretend that none of it is fact.\n It doesn't matter how hard you insist on sticking your fingers in your ears, HIV-1 originated in Africa!\n \n I challenged you earlier to show me ANY scientific article which assessed \"HIV-1 did not come out of Africa\".\n You have still failed to do so.\n Cause you can't.\n The only reason you THOUGHT it could is because of a previous thought you put forward which has already been proven inaccurate.\n And now you try to move the goal-posts...",

   "The reason why this article and the proceeding claims that the African strain of HIV has been around since the late 19th or early 20th century, is not only irrelevant, but ludicrous as it relates to the American AIDS debate is because that strain of African HIV is completely unique to, and different than the strain of AIDS that afflicted the homosexual communities in New York and San-francisco GAY bath houses in the late 70s and early 80s.\n \n AIDS didn't pop up in any American communities other than the GAY community. So your attempt to make it a universal disease by using the African strain as evidence is both dishonest and fraudulent at its most basic level. But that is par for the course for how the radical homosexual community will cling to any potential opportunity to deny their culpability for being the cause for the existence of this particular American strain of HIV which was created within and spread from its own community because its promiscuous and unsafe sexual activities.\n\n \n Archie watch rent. Thats all I have to say. If you dont feel an ounce of human pity or shed a tear well then your not even close to the realm of compassion. There is an element which I fear you overlook and that is the human element.\n \n The people suffering the families the grief. All of it. We need a cure and hopefully we'll find one.",

   "Great link. NOW PROVE IT!\n\n The gall of some people.\n You ignore the evidence we provide, making baffling statements like \"prove it\" even though you are being shown proof...\n ... and on the other hand, you throw out the most absurd ideas, and demand others prove you wrong.\n \n The only consistency in all of this is no matter what the case, the responsibility is on somebody else to do work, while all you have to do is make stupid junk up!\n \n \n \nemoticon_xdonno From your link:\n He said the team were currently working to understand if the genetic differences between SIVcpz and HIV evolved as a response to the species jump.\n Keith Alcorn of Aidsmap said: \"The researchers have pinned down a very specific location where they believe the precursor of HIV came from.\n \"But there are vast areas of west Africa where other forms of SIVcpz lineages exist, and the possibility remains for human infection.\n Yusef Azad, policy director of the National Aids Trust said: \"This research is interesting as all discoveries which relate to the history and origins of HIV could be of value to the vital work being carried out by scientists in developing a HIV vaccine.\"\n \n It seems that many questions and much work remains to be done before anything absolute is known. Yet you people stand by these links as if they are absolute confirmation of something.\n\n Archie, you're taking questions about X and pretending that means something about Y.\n The ideas about HOW the species jump happened (the mechanics) do not mean the species jump did not happen.\n The species jump DID HAPPEN. THAT is not in dispute...\n \n \n \nAnd foundit, quote my whole statement if you intend to critique it. Not just cherry picked parts of it which redacts the meat of the point I was trying to make.\n\n What a pathetic and boring complaint.\n I quoted you accurately.\n My reply would have been changed, in absolutely no way, by wasting more space by \"quoting your whole statement\".\n \n Why don't you argue what WAS said instead of mewling out these meaningless complaints?\n \n \n \nFor example, I am posting what the experts \"believed\" about this virus's birth and its growth, not my own personal beliefs.\n\n 1) You have yet to supply any proof of that claim.\n You NEED to supply proof of that claim.\n \n 2) You demanded others DISPROVE a theory that is \"not your own personal belief\"???\n How ridiculous is that?\n \n 3) I have already explained why what you said was ultimately completely ridiculous.\n If ANY \"expert\" actually did put forth your ridiculous idea as a potential idea, it was at such an early stage in the discovery of the AIDS problem that it was based more on ignorance of the problem, with little available data, than an actual biological assessment.\n As I said, but of course you failed to respond to, viruses don't form from \"bacteria\".\n \n 4) In the end, I think this is just another one of those things where you don't know what you're talking about.\n Like your claim that the U.S. HIV virus was \"unique\" to the U.S., when it has been proven that not only is it not unique to the U.S., but it also originated in Africa.\n You take some little tidbit, fail to comprehend what is REALLY going on, and derive all sorts of illogical conclusions.\n And when somebody calls you on it, you run from the subject with meaningless complaints.",
