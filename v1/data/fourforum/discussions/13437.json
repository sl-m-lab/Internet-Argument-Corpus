   "Bathed in camera flashes during a \"news conference\" on October 7, 2009, New York City's mayor, Michael Bloomberg was in his element in announcing \"a wide-ranging undercover investigation by the City of New York into illegal gun sales\" that revealed \"a willful disregard of the law\" by \"74% of gun show sellers.\" \n \n Or, so he claimed. The ego-driven multi-billionaire's publicity stunt was neither \"wide-ranging\" nor representative of what occurs at gun shows, nor was it intended to be. And it determined nothing about \"74%\" of all gun show sellers. \n \n Instead, as Bloomberg's report on the stunt openly admits, his \"investigators\" attended gun shows only \"in states . . . that supply crime guns trafficked across state lines at the highest rates,\" only in neighborhoods with the highest incidence of \"federal prosecutions for straw buying and trafficking, and proximity to urban areas experiencing gang violence,\" and ultimately focused their attention on only 47 individuals who, based upon their comments and actions, seemed the most likely to violate a gun sale law. \n \n Even that amount of deliberate skewing of Bloomberg's sample of the nation's \"gun show sellers\" did not work as he expected. Only 35 of the 47 (hence, the fraudulent \"74%\" claim) ultimately exercised poor judgment with respect to a gun sale law or, in perhaps some of the cases, may have been willing to break a law, and thus be subject to prosecution. \n \n Anti-gun groups and politicians immediately heralded Bloomberg's effort as definitive proof of the need for more restrictions on guns. \"Thanks to Mayor Bloomberg and the New York City Police Department, the public can see firsthand what goes on at these weapons markets,\" said the Brady Campaign. \"This investigation reveals how easy it is for criminals and even terrorists to purchase firearms at gun shows,\" said Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.). \n \n And, since the day of fair, hard and objective reporting has apparently passed into journalism's history, newspapers went along with Bloomberg's charade like shills at a carnival game of chance, reminding us why public confidence in \"the press\" has dropped to 15% in annual polls. \n \n \"[I]n almost three out of four instances, undercover investigators were able to purchase guns illegally,\" the New York Times dutifully reported. Bloomberg's investigators \"repeatedly bought guns from unlicensed dealers at gun shows even though they disclosed they probably couldn't pass a background check,\" said the Washington Post. \"Bloomberg's sting documented that these transient marketplaces for guns, ammunition and accessories are a multibillion-dollar business that is funneling weapons directly into criminals' hands, in plain sight,\" said the New York Daily News. \"Any doubt that stricter regulation would be helpful was removed last week when the results of an undercover investigation of gun show sales in Tennessee and two other states was released by the office of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg,\" the (Memphis) Commercial Appeal editorialized. \n \n Bloomberg's bottom line? You guessed it. Congress should adopt S. 843 and H.R. 2324 to \"close the gun show loophole by requiring background checks on all firearm sales at gun shows.\" Bloomberg and his media friends failed to mention, of course, that both bills also propose that gun show promoters be registered, be required to pay unspecific fees, and be required to maintain ledgers of all non-dealers who bring firearms to shows (even if they bring them to sell only to dealers). H.R. 2324 further proposes that promoters be required to provide such ledgers to the Attorney General.\n \n Reporters worthy of the name would have pointed out that buying a gun for a family member or friend as a gift is not a straw purchase. It's a violation of the law only to buy a gun for a prohibited person. And competent reporters would have also noticed that Bloomberg's \"investigation\" actually undercuts his call for requiring background checks on non-dealer sales at gun shows. The most common gun sale violation, Bloomberg says, is that straw purchasers defeat the background check. Requiring more sales to be run through checks would not alleviate the straw purchase problem one whit. \n \n Individuals-dealers and non-dealers alike-who knowingly break the law should, of course, be prosecuted, as NRA has long advocated. Obtaining and providing a gun for a prohibited person are both federal felonies, each punishable by 10 years in prison. \n \n However, enforcing gun sale laws is the responsibility of the BATFE, and state and local agencies. Bloomberg has no jurisdiction in other cities, let alone outside New York State. His periodic interstate escapades, of which \"Gun Show\" is but the latest, are not only possibly illegal (in that they may violate firearm sales laws), but risk compromising federal, state and local law enforcement agencies' investigations. \n \n At the bottom line, Bloomberg's effort shows that even when you work very hard to find law-breakers at gun shows, you find that such individuals are few and far between. \n Once again, Hizzoner demonstrates his true priority-media grandstanding.",

It's like saying he bought a cup of coffee in another state. Anyone can do that too.\n\n \n No it can't be done. The mayor of one city can't authorize an undercover sting investigation in another state. The mayor is not law enforcement and can't orchestrate with other divisions. He has no power to usurp the authority of another mayor for any reason, because it's not his territory.\n \n Your entire argument is akin to claiming that North Korea is freely able to send spies over to America because we're currently in a hostile climate with them.\n \n \nBeing a multi-billionaire is not evidence of fraud.\n\n \n No but conducting investigations, the likes of which designed to be law enforcement work, and defrauding unsuspecting victims, is evidence of fraud. Bloomberg has done both.\n \n \nPrivate investigators don't have the authority to arrest people. They are not law enforcement.\n \n \n Oh really? Well if that's the case then these \"investigators\" have to be brought before the courts for their crimes. Since no arrests were made, that means nobody but Bloomberg was informed of what took place, and he didn't tell anyone.\n \n If you have knowledge of a crime taking place, you're required to inform the police so they can make an arrest. Otherwise you're guilty of the crime of aiding and abetting a known or suspected criminal, and hindering a police investigation. And since these matters are delegated to federal authorities these \"investigators\" can be charged with felony offenses. That means serious prison time for them.\n \n And if investigators aren't law enforcement, how can they carry out undercover sting operations in the first place?\n \n \nYes, it did. Four specific recommendations are given under the \"Solution Two: ATF Should Enforce Existing Laws at Gun Shows\" part of the report.\n\n \n And where is the evidence that they aren't enforcing the existing laws?\n \n \nSo the ATF needs a judge to sign a warrant before investigating a crime?\n \n \n In this case, yes. The ATF, like any other law enforcement agency, is prohibited from investigating a person without sufficient proof to actually warrant the investigation. \n \n Otherwise it would be like the police saying \"We're going to investigate this black man because we saw him standing at a street corner last night. We think he's guilty of a crime, but we don't know what that crime is yet. Find any evidence you can to justify his arrest.\"\n \n \nYou were complaining that he wasn't doing enough about those 35 sellers in other states.\n\n \n Because if these 35 sellers committed actual crimes, then why weren't they reported to the police? Surely if Bloomberg is serious about getting tough on crime, he'd have them all brought up on charges, right?\n \n And nevermind other states. Bloomberg hasn't been able to even address the crime levels in his own city. What gives him the authority to outsource his mayoral power to other parts of the country? If he can't control his own city, why should he try and control matters outside his city territory?",

   "There is nothing illegal about Bloomberg hiring private investigators to conduct \"investigations\" for him in my state. However, those PIs were bound to obey Federal and Virginia law. \n \n But the very concept of hiring private investigators to conduct investigations was problematic at best. These men had a financial motive to deliver what their employer wanted in order to keep the money flowing. I have dealt with PIs before, and in my experience when the truth conflicts with satisfying the money man there is a strong tendency for the truth to suffer from the encounter. Additionally, these \"investigations\" were conducted in secret and with a reckless disregard for whether or not they interfered with any legitimate law enforcement investigation. He never informed law enforcement of what he was doing, and he never checked to see if what he was doing would run afoul of a legitimate law enforcement operation. Imagine the embarrassment that would have ensued if Bloomberg's PIs had blown up a legitimate investigation while being arrested by mistake for trying to make a straw purchase. It was fortune alone that kept these men from bungling into a legitimate investigation by sworn officers. \n \n On the gun store purchases the premise of the PI investigation was that the dealer was told the gun was being purchased on behalf of another person who could not make the purchase himself because he could not pass the background check. The following crime applies to this situation-for which there is an exception for a legitimate investigation by a sworn law enforcement officer but not an exception for an amateur PI: \n \n Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2 (L)(1) Any person who attempts to solicit, persuade, encourage, or entice any dealer to transfer or otherwise convey a firearm other than to the actual buyer, as well as any other person who willfully and intentionally aids or abets such person, shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. This subsection shall not apply to a federal law-enforcement officer or a law-enforcement officer as defined in \u00a7 9.1-101, in the performance of his official duties, or other person under his direct supervision.\n \n Needless to say the disclosure of this \"investigation\" ruffled law enforcement feathers in my state. But instead of choosing to waste time prosecuting these incidents our Attorney General chose to intervene and put a stop to the amateur hour political propaganda tour. \n \n Attempted purchases from private individuals are another matter, and Bloomberg's PIs did not break any laws by doing so. But you need a little more explanation of why it is difficult to prosecute a private seller. If a private seller goes to a gun show or runs an ad for his gun in a newspaper you still must prove he was predisposed to sell to a prohibited person. If law enforcement just blunders up to him (as apparently Bloomberg's PIs did) and says something like \"hey I'm a felon (or I probably can't pass a dealer's background check) but will you sell your gun to me\" then you run the risk of an entrapment defense. See the Virginia model jury instruction:\n \n Entrapment is the origination and planning of an offense by an officer of the law and his procurement of its commission by one who would not have committed it except for the trickery, persuasion or fraud of the officer. Where a person intends to and does commit the crime, the fact that officers of the law provided a favorable opportunity for, aided or encouraged the commission of the offense is not entrapment. If you believe:\n (1) That the defendant had no previous intent or purpose to commit the crime; and\n (2) That an officer of the law, directly or through his agents, originated in the mind of the defendant the idea to commit the crime; and\n (3) That an officer of the law, directly or through his agents, caused the defendant to commit the crime by trickery, persuasion or fraud;\n then you shall find the defendant not guilty even though you may believe from the evidence that he consented to the commission of the crime.\n \n This is why legitimate investigations into illegal gun running take months to complete. You have to build up a case to show that the runner or seller is predisposed to commit the crime, and that all your agents did was give him the opportunity to do what he already wanted to do. This involves following and tracking what the target suspect does over a period of time. And all the time and resources which are devoted to these investigations are put at risk when a politician from another state decides to secretly send amateur mercenaries into the arena. \n \n Finally, let me say this. The fact remains that handguns are cheaper and easier to obtain in Virginia. No one has to run guns into Virginia to avoid a law restricting handguns. And so the question for the mayor is this: If, as he has claimed, the supply of illegal guns is the problem in his city, then why is Virginia's per capita murder and violent crime rate so much lower than New York's? If it really is the supply of guns, then why is the rate so much higher in his city-so many miles and states away-than in the Virginia city which actually hosts the gun show?",

   "Lets be clear. What Bloomberg is attempting to do is scam the country into persecuting the 2nd Amendment just as much as they possibly can scam America into doing! If he and or Galileo could, they would Kill the 2nd Amendment in a heart beat! However they have several problems. \n \n 1.   New Gun Law Polling Data  suggest that We the American people aren't buying the anti-gunners lies. \n \n 2. Gun control is NOT crime Control! \n  The CDC studied 51 of the best gun control studies the World could produce. What did they find?  \n \"the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.\" \n\n They suggest more studies. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n Here is an article about the study  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n \n 3. Crime in the U.S., but especially violent crime is at or neat historic lows.   The U.S. Justice Department says Serious violent crime levels remained well below levels of 10 years ago.  and this excellent trend is continuing.\n   Crime in the United States -- per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1989-2008 \n 1989 Violent crime rate = 666.9 Murder rate = 8.7\n 1991 Violent crime rate = 758.2 Murder rate = 9.8\n 2008 Violent crime rate = 454.5 Murder rate = 5.4\n \n So he and the rest of the Anti-2nd Amendment crowed have to continually invent reasons to SCAM America into doing what they want.\n \n The ONLY rights that the Anti-gunners have to persecute the Bill of Rights and our Inalienable Rights is the laws we enact, and it usually is ALL a SCAM! But even those, we have in abundance.\n   The \"Unregulated\" Gun  \n \"Gun Laws of America is 384 pages of just the federal statutes that regulate guns-more than 88,000 words. Additionally, the associated federal regulations interpreting these laws are even larger. Minimum penalty for a violation is typically 5 years in federal prison for every offense.\n \n It is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America. Those laws include restrictions on possession, carry, distribution, storage, transfer, manufacture, sale, ownership, importation, use and more. \n\n Allow me to remind everyone about all of the Federal gun laws passed during the Gun HATING Clinton Administration.\n 1.Brady background checks for all handgun buyers, \n 2.institution of the waiting period,\n 3. Making it illegal for anyone under 18 to own or even possess a handgun.\n 4. The President's executive order stopping the importation of many guns,\n 5. Excessive fees and regulations that drove many legitimate gun shop owners out of business.\n 6. The widening of Brady to include background checks from just handguns to include all new firearm purchases. \n 7. Insta Check! \n 8. Additional disqualification's and changes to legal firearms purchases on form 4473, \n 9. The assault weapons ban. \n 10. The ten round magazine,\n 11 Lautenburg.\n 12. Just recently the NICS improvement act!\n \n But they are not even remotely satisfied. And they Never will be! They will keep trying until the 2nd Amendment, and consequently the Bill of Rights is Dead! What you do to one of the Bill of Rights can and WILL be done to the rest!",

   "Study on guns was just scare tactic - TribToday.com - News, Sports, Jobs, Community Information - Tribune Chronicle - Warren, OH\n \n On Thursday the Tribune Chronicle ran a story titled, \"Study: Guns bought illegally at shows.'' Darcie Loreno did a good job on reporting the facts as they were given to her. The same is true for the radio and television coverage the story received.\n \n However, I find serious fault with the details reported to the media. While the facts may be accurate and correct, the motive and purpose behind the investigation is another assault on the Second Amendment. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Mayors Against Illegal Guns are only trying to use scare tactics to promote their personal agenda.\n \n If the ''test'' at the Niles Gun Show produced five illegal purchases of handguns, why were the sellers not arrested? They broke the law and there is solid proof or is there? Bloomberg and MAIG are after the shock factor trying to scare people into thinking we need more laws on the books, yet they don't enforce existing laws. If you believe their cries for more legislation, shame on you. The public should be outraged that these so called illegal sales were made to undercover investigators in our community, and no arrests were made.\n \n If Mayor O'Brien is honestly trying to prevent the illegal sale of firearms, why doesn't he insist the existing laws are enforced and the individuals who made the sale are arrested? I'm sure Niles police Chief Bruce Simeone would gladly make the arrests when provided the proof from the undercover investigators and MAIG. O'Brien does nothing since there is allegedly proof of the illegal sales, shame on him. He might find out that the so-called ''illegal purchases'' may not be as credible as they are purported.\n \n Supporting MAIG and more legislation is not the answer to illegal gun sales.",

The words are there but not the total meaning of them! emoticon_smile\n \n Lets take a look at this thinly veiled attempt to move ever closer to absolute gun registration. First is was, \"We ONLY want a background check when someone buys a new handgun. That is all we are asking for. Nothing more.\" However we now have a background check when anyone buys every kind of a new gun, not just handguns. Are you satisfied? NOPE!\n \n Now there is a loophole, instead! People can buy guns at a gunshow from private sellers without a background check. Wouldn't we want to do that, since that is the purpose of the regulation in the first place? That is all you are asking for, (now)! Just when someone buys a gun from a private seller at a gunshow. Nothing more. Will you then be satisfied? NOPE!\n \n Then there will be the private seller loophole! Wouldn't we want to do that, since that is the purpose of the regulation in the first place? If you get that, would you Antis be satisfied? NOPE! Because how can we tell if everyone is complying with this regulation? Wouldn't we want to do that, since that is the purpose of the regulation in the first place? So what you will ask for then, is absolute and total Gun Registration with very serious felony penalties for possessing an unregistered gun! \n \n All of THAT to criminalize the law-abiding citizen for actually having the AUDACITY to believe, and participate in a Constitutionally recognized as Inalienable, and there for protected from this kind of infringements in the first place. \n \n   Preamble to the Bill of Rights \nTHE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution.\n \n 2nd Amendment.  \"A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\"\n \n The ONLY rights the Anti-Constitutionalists have against our Bill of Rights are the Infringements we grant them in what they call the Bill of Rights Loophole!\n \n   The Second Amendment strikes back  \n Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence Tribe says, \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\"   Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \n",

You call these matters irrelevant?\n \n Operations like this, when carried out by people other than law enforcement, is classified as vigilantism.\n \n \nCan you back up your claims that crimes were committed by Bloomberg and the private investigators with actual evidence? I didn't realize that failure to report a crime is a crime but if I asked you to quote the text of the law that says that it would probably never happen.\n \n \n The crime of obstruction of justice includes crimes committed by judges, prosecutors, attorneys general, and elected officials in general. It is misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance in the conduct of the office. Most commonly it is prosecuted as a crime for perjury by a non governmental official primarily because of prosecutorial discretion. Prosecutors and attorneys general however commit obstruction of justice when they fail to prosecute judges and other government officials for malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance in office.\n \n Modern obstruction of justice, in United States jurisdictions, refers to the crime of offering interference of any sort to the work of police, investigators, regulatory agencies, prosecutors, or other (usually government) officials. Often, no actual investigation or substantiated suspicion of a specific incident need exist to support a charge of obstruction of justice.\n \n \nAnd the NYC report may lead to people being brought to justice:\n\n \n The ATF already said none of the licensed dealers inspected by Bloomberg broke any laws.

Ten years in prison isn't good enough for you?\n \n \nIf the police arent gonna protect our rights\n\n \n First, what makes you think the police are doing nothing? The invest hundreds of man hours and millions of dollars in conducting undercover investigations to apprehend criminals. Do you call that doing nothing?\n \n Second, the police aren't there for protecting your rights, or even you. The duty of the police is to enforce the laws and apprehend those that break them. And if you get killed by some loose criminal with a gun then it's just too bad, that's just par for the course. You have no right to sue the police for failure to protect you, as said by the courts, meaning you never had a right to be protected by the police.\n \n \nfrom criminals at gun shows\n\n \n The ATF and DOJ has long said that less than 1% of the guns used by criminals ever came from a gun show. You're trying to make a mountain of a molehill. If you were serious about actually protecting the rights of others, you'd be in support of keeping convicted criminals behind bars for their total sentence.\n \n \nthen someones gotta do it.\n\n \n Oh? Is this Brady calling for widespread acts of illegal vigilantism? Is he slitting his own throat here and now? First he comes out and admits he's a serial killer, and now he's saying he basically wants homeowners to act like judge, jury and executioner when dealing with criminals.\n \n \nAnd gun nuts certainly dont wanna do anything about the problem.\n\n \n That's because there is no problem here. The only problem is in the justice department, where criminals are allowed to plea to lesser charges in exchange for getting off harsher punishments. Most convicted criminals don't even serve one half of their sentences.\n \n \nIf bin laden himself got caught on tape at a gun show gun nuts here would only care about putting the guy with the camera behind bars.\n\n \n If Bin Laden has enough money to buy crates of rocket launchers and RPGs, why would he ever come to America and limit his buying market to semi-automatic-only AK-47 variants; variants that no army of any sort has ever used in organized warfare?\n \n That's like saying Obama wouldn't go to his private physicians because he felt standard American health care was all he ever needed.",

New York City's per capita murder rate was 6.3 per 100k, and the violent crime rate was 583.5 per 100k. Virginia's statewide murder rate was 4.7 per 100k and the violent crime rate was 255.91 per 100k. The city I was referring to was Salem, Virginia. I used it because it hosts an annual gun show held at the Salem Civic Center every year, and I have bought both arms and ammo there in the past. Salem had only 2 murders in '08 and only 36 violent crimes in '08, and so was perhaps an unfair example to use to compare with New York City (particularly when Bloomberg avoided Virginia altogether when he did his gun show sting report-having worn out his welcome attempting to investigate gun dealers in my state). \n \n It may also be unfair to consider the actual gun show cities cited by Bloomberg in his report. Niles, Ohio, was the first city he cited in his report which had data reported in the '08 UCR table. Niles had no murders in '08, and so compares unfavorably to NYC no matter how great the difference is in population density. I suspect, however, that if you look at some of the metropolitan cities which had gun shows he \"investigated\" you would find crime rates comparable to NYC-which begs the question of what impact, if any, the metropolitan nature of the location has to do with crime rates....",

This report just confirms what weve known for a long time that alot of bad things are happening at gun shows. \n\n \n Wait a minute. &#8220;Found a memo from bin laden&#8221;?!? Come on, Brady. In my line of work I often argue that &#8220;a bad lie is often better than a good confession.&#8221; A confession is at least an acknowledgment of wrongdoing that can justify mercy in sentencing&#8212;but bad liars just as easily convict themselves by being caught in their lies while deserving no mercy because they remain defiantly unrepentant. \n \n I searched the VPC site for your claim, Brady. The closest I could get to finding Bin Laden at the VPC website was an old claim that during the time the U.S. supported the Afghan resistance against the Soviet invasion Al Queda obtained 25 .50 rifles&#8212;which the VPC claimed must have come from the U.S. civilian market: \n \n \"As the VPC surmised in its original report, Voting from the Rooftops, Essam al Ridi apparently bought these rifles on the civilian market. By some means unknown he then shipped them to the bin Laden organization. We can only speculate on whether al Ridi got help in this transaction from the private network of nongovernment Americans who were actively supporting the provision of military arms to the Afghan resistance.\" \n \n http://www.vpc.org/graphics/snipercia.pdf\n \n You will no doubt note that the VPC makes its claim using terms like &#8220;apparently,&#8221; &#8220;by some means unknown,&#8221; and &#8220;we can only speculate&#8221;--words used to fill in the cracks left when the evidence is spread too thin. \n \n But to return to your claim, Brady: &#8220;why did the vpc say they found a memo from bin laden instructing al quada members to go to US gun shows and buy weapons?&#8221; The answer, Brady, is it didn&#8217;t make such a claim. \n \n No, Brady, bin laden did not add the VPC to his e-mail distribution list. Josh Sugarman has not gone to Afghanistan and found a bin laden memo crumpled up in a trash can in some cave. There is no evidence of a bin laden memo, and I found the VPC was &#8220;apparently&#8221; unwilling to further &#8220;speculate&#8221; that a bin laden memo exists directing his operatives to get guns from a gun show, leaving me to conclude that your latest claim (like so many of your others) is sourced &#8220;by some means unknown.&#8221; \n \n Liar, Liar, pants on fire, Brady.\n \n ---\n \n \"The hardest tumble a man can make is to fall over his own bluff.\" Ambrose Bierce\n \n \"It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief, if I may so express it, that mental lying has produced in society.

I was worried that if I first claimed this must be your source and jumped you about misrepresenting it then you would have either ignored it or pretended that it was not the source for your claim. So I wanted to see if I could get you to identify it as your source first. You know as well as I do that what I cited from and your source are both linked together around the VPC \"study\" it calls \"Voting from the rooftops.\" I intentionally misdirected you to the related document I cited from the VPC to try and draw you out into confirming your source. I also intentionally took a play on words from your \"source\" when I argued \"Sugarman has not gone to Afghanistan and found a bin laden memo crumpled up in a trash can in some cave.\" I thought it might help prompt you to come back and hit me with what your source claimed-\"reportedly been found in abandoned terrorist safe houses in Kabul, Afghanistan.\" \n \n To tell the truth I expected you to run away from me again as you have done so often in the past. That's why at the end of my post I stung you with the quotes about lying to try and force your hand. \n \n So now that you have claimed it let's look at how you have misrepresented your source.... \n \n You will first note that I will quote nothing from your source which touches on the topic of the thread-gun shows-because your source does not mention them at all. But your source does claim this about the pamphlet: \n \n \"The Violence Policy Center (VPC) has obtained the full text of the pamphlet, which has also reportedly been found in abandoned terrorist safe houses in Kabul, Afghanistan.... \n \n jihad training pamphlet posted on a web site that has been used by a most-wanted Al Qaeda fugitive....\n \n a newsletter published by the pro-jihad site....The site has been cited as supporting the Taliban and Al Qaeda....\n \n the anonymous authors of the jihad training document....\"\n \n An honest reading of your VPC source reveals that the VPC does not even claim the pamphlet was authored by an Al Qaeda operative. The VPC most certainly does not claim that bin laden himself authored it. \n \n You could have accurately cited the VPC press release and used it by analogy to attack gun shows, but obviously the story as written was not good enough for you-and you decided to embellish it. \n \n You took what the VPC said-\"the anonymous authors of the jihad training document\" found on a web site \"cited as supporting the Taliban and Al Qaeda\"-and you changed it to read \"a memo from bin laden instructing al quada members.\" \n \n You should have stuck to what the VPC said, Brady. \"Beware of the half truth. You may have gotten hold of the wrong half.\"-Author Unknown. But you could not leave well enough alone.\n \n Now by posting your source as an after-the-fact justification for your claim you do at least give the impression that you read it beforehand. And I do not discount the possibility that you read the VPC press release so long ago that you cannot remember exactly what it said. But that only proves the wisdom of the following: \n \n \"It is not without good reason said, that he who has not a good memory should never take upon him the trade of lying.\" Michel de Montaigne\n \n Do you want to still claim we are only \"splitting hairs\" here, Brady? \n \n ---\n \n \"Nothing is easier than self-deceit. For what each man wishes, that he also believes to be true.\" Demosthenes\n \n \"He who permits himself to tell a lie once, finds it much easier to do it a second and third time, till at length it becomes habitual.\" Thomas Jefferson",

These investigations involved a total of 84,128 firearms that had been diverted from legal to illegal commerce. All told, the report identified more than 26,000 firearms that had been illegally trafficked through gun shows in 212 separate investigations. The report stated that: \"A prior review of ATF gun show investigations shows that prohibited persons, such as convicted felons and juveniles, do personally buy firearms at gun shows and gun shows are sources of firearms that are trafficked to such prohibited persons. The gun show review found that firearms were diverted at and through gun shows by straw purchasers, unregulated private sellers, and licensed dealers. Felons were associated with selling or purchasing firearms in 46 percent of the gun show investigations. Firearms that were illegally diverted at or through gun shows were recovered in subsequent crimes, including homicide and robbery, in more than a third of the gun show investigations.\"\n http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/downloads/pdf/Following_the_Gun%202000.pdf",

The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association has a suggestion for saving several million taxpayer dollars each year: abolish the Combined Ballistic Identification System (COBIS).\n \n The COBIS program was introduced by Gov. Pataki in 2000. Its stated purpose is to collect identifying data from the shell casings of all new handguns sold in the state. This information is then entered into a database for use by law enforcement to aid in identifying and prosecuting criminals. Since its inception, over a quarter of a million shell cases have been collected and entered into the database at an estimated cost of $32 million and not a single arrest or conviction has resulted. In fact, COBIS has proven to be such a boondoggle that no other state is even considering implementing their own version of it.If Gov. Paterson is serious about saving money, then COBIS ought to be at the top of the list of programs to be cut.

I don't see how the state can prove a reduction in transfers which people by necessity hide from the government.

That figure might tell us something about how effective the law has been. And by this I mean those which were not mistaken denials because the purchaser had a similar name or similar SS# of someone else who was a felon and the dealer mistyped a number or a letter into the computer.

   "Mere speculation? You call their own organizations severing their ties, to be mere speculation?\n \n What kind of denial are you in?\n\n What are you talking about? I was talking about the claim that fraud was committed so the results of the study can't be believed. \n \n \n \n\n What exactly are you writing off as accusations?\n \n Is it the part that as a mayor, Bloomberg has no training in law enforcement matters, and as such he should just butt out of the matters of the police?\n \n Or is it the part that in his zeal to capture the spotlight, his undercover sting operations have put legitimate investigations on the line and might have let known gun traffickers escape justice on a technicality?\n \n Hypothetical question for you, Galileo. If I gathered up a dozen of my friends and we stormed the local crack house, making citizen arrests of everyone that was there, beating them with truncheons, and killing those that gave us resistance and tried to flee the scene, and we justified our acts with something along the lines of \"The police had firsthand knowledge about what was going on here but chose not to do a thing about it, so the duty fell to us to keep the neighborhood safe!\" would you consider that an act of vigilantism, or would you support our actions?\n \n If you consider that to be vigilantism, then why would Bloomberg's actions NOT qualify as the same. You keep saying the private investigators aren't law enforcement, which means they didn't have grounds to conduct such investigations. Or are you going to make an exception for Bloomberg and his cronies since they're not private citizens like the rest of us?\n\n It's clear from my previous posts I'm not making an exception for anyone. I'm not writing anything off but I'm not jumping to conclusions about what happened. Vague claims about vigilantism mean nothing if you can't show specific laws that were broken. \n \n \n \n\n No evidence presented that armed people posed any danger to airlines. Your argument fails, and so do you.\n\n Nice dodge again. My point was not to argue for the effectiveness of a certain policy but to show an example of a policy that is intended to stop the bad guys but also effects the good guys. \n \n \n \n\n And you believe that the way a country views the rights of its people and what protections they have against government intrusion, to not be relevant on the matter at hand?\n \n The crime statistics that STILL don't add up: Ministry of Justice 'shambles' | Mail Online\n \n Violent Crime Surges 22% after police reveal they miscounted serious attacks - mirror.co.uk\n\n Your first link is about sentencing statistics- not really relevant to what I'm talking about. The second link is about an increase in violent crime but the date is more than a decade after the UK handgun ban so it really can't be blamed on that. \n \n \n\n True or false: The Rwanda massacre, which was carried out primarily with machetes, was situation in a nation with very over the top gun control, but still left between 500,000 and one million people dead.\n\n So your solution is to hand out guns to people who massacre each other with machetes. You should visit other African nations and observe boys as young as 12 toting around AK47s. More guns just makes things worse and prolongs conflicts. It's really an argument for more government control to stop the people from killing each other.",

If Violence reduction and crime control is the game it becomes relatively simple. Those who commit the crimes of violence get segragated from those who don't. Stop the revolving door joke of a criminal justice system. \n \n You make a statement of more guns just makes things worse and expect the reader to swallow that canard whole hog. Sorry you need a lot more evidence that you say so. Remember all the screeches and screams of the blood bathes to follow when Florida passed their concealed carry laws? They didn't happen. More guns have the opposite effect. For you statement to ring true in any fashion then Washington DC, NYC and Chicago should be among the safest cities to live in. Yet we find much higher violence and murder rates in the less or no guns areas. For your scenario to be true then Alexandria VA should have much higher rates of murder and violence than DC since they have many more guns. Yet they don't.

The government was responsible for the Rwanda massacre, they hired the guerrillas that killed everybody. Why exactly is more government sanctioned gun control the answer when they made the massacre possible in the first place?\n\n \"Between April and June 1994, an estimated 800,000 Rwandans were killed in the space of 100 days. Most of the dead were Tutsis - and most of those who perpetrated the violence were Hutus.... Ethnic tension in Rwanda is nothing new. There have been always been disagreements between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis, but the animosity between them has grown substantially since the colonial period... Soldiers and police officers encouraged ordinary citizens to take part. In some cases, Hutu civilians were forced to murder their Tutsi neighbours by military personnel. Participants were often given incentives, such as money or food, and some were even told they could appropriate the land of the Tutsis they killed.... On the ground at least, the Rwandans were largely left alone by the international community. UN troops withdrew after the murder of 10 soldiers. Finally, in July, the RPF captured Kigali. The government collapsed and the RPF declared a ceasefire. As soon as it became apparent that the RPF was victorious, an estimated two million Hutus fled to Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). These refugees include many who have since been implicated in the massacres. \"\n BBC NEWS | Africa | Rwanda: How the genocide happened\n \n Main points:\n So an ethnic minority is persecuted and massacred by members of the majority in a country. There is a history of conflict between these two ethnic groups. Civilians are encouraged to take part in the massacre. The UN decides it does not want to get involved in the conflict and withdraws its troops. Finally, a rebel group (the RPF), composed of members of the minority, is victorious and is able to overthrow the government. Millions of people in the majority group flee the country. Many of them fear retribution for having taken part in the massacre. \n \n I still don't see how having more guns around would have improved the situation. More guns would also have empowered the bad guys.",
