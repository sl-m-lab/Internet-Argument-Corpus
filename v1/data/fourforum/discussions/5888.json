   "I've been hearing this from local LE for the last couple of years:\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050705/ap_on_re_us/methamphetamine_report\n \n Our johnny on the spot federal government still says pot is the number #1 dangerous drug. This has been brought up in other threads, where a county sheriff (mine and others) can fund a helicopter to search for growers through a federal grant within weeks by stepping up pot busts and showing activity, but the DEA still claims meth is a 'localized' problem. A meth bust is dirty, can be health endangering and doesn't have the big amounts of money and product to spread on tables for newspaper publicity federal agencies seek in every activity. \n \n Well, we're still in denial about Iraq, so why not include meth in that getting full bag of horrors.",

I can't remember the last time I read about a pot arrest other than school kids on campus and this is a big pot growing area. Alcohol and meth are the drugs of choice here that get LE attention. They like DWIs for revenue and have no choice about meth because tweakers get way out of control.",
