   "Do any of you members have a Talking Starling?\n I do! and he is AMAZING!\n \n I found Sweet Pea when he was about 9 days old - he had fallen or, pushed out of his nest.\n He is now 9 months old and has been talking up a storm since he was 3 months!\n \n Here is a partial list of his vocabulary:\n \n Hi Honey\n Hi Sweet Pea\n Hi Jack\n Hi Sweet Jack\n Jack's a good boy\n Here kitty, kitty, kitty\n Where's the Kitty?\n Ohp! There's the Kitty!\n Hey! get off a the door!\n Bad Cat\n What ch doin?\n What are you doing?\n Meow\n Gotta go to work\n Okay?\n See you later\n Did you eat all your crunchies?\n \n Starlings require a certain amount of 'flight time' every day so, I let him out of his cage in the evenings to take his bath in his crystal bowl/tub.\n \n He used to be very camera shy and it was hard to get him on video but, he is getting more relaxed about it. I'm still trying to record him when he goes off on one of his hour-long ramblings when he says everything - at least 10 times! :p\n \n Here is the latest video of him after he had a bath:\n YouTube - Sweet Pea Talking Starling after bath preening2.AVI\n \n I have 8 of them posted but, this is the best so far. :p\n \n \n European Starling - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

   "Are mynah birds related to starlings?\n\n \n Actually, I read on that Wiki page that Starlings are often called 'The poor man's Mynah'.\n \n Birds do not have a larynx, but sing/talk with an organ called the syrinx. The syrinx is located at the bottom of the trachea (the tube just above the lungs). It is made up of chambers whose \"walls\" (membranes) vibrate when air passes them. Birds use special muscles to change the shapes of the membranes, which changes the sounds of their songs. It is interesting to note that birds with some of the most beautiful songs -- such as Mockingbirds, and superb mimics, such as European Starlings-- have more muscles to control the membranes of the syrinx\n European Starlings: Information Resource on Sturnus Vulgaris\n \n To answer your question (yes), I found this:\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myna\n \n Here is an incredible video of Starlings in flight:\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-groCeKbE&feature=PlayList&p=149D7ED380FC94E1&playnext=1&playnext_from=PL&index=40",
