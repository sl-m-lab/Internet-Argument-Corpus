   "It seems as though Tel Aviv has sent copies of over 800 documents to Washington concering the diaspora that occured in the late '40 in Iraq. Compensation for the ousting of Jews out of Iraq is being sought by the state of Israel. \n \n Hmm, now isn't this a little ironic, just a dash hypocritical. Oh my suffering brothers, it seems that a state that doesn't recognize external diaspora is seeking reparations after dealing with hardships of settling another people's land. I ask you, where is the Palestinian compensation? The Palestinian right of return? The people that were uprooted and driven to ghettos or neighboring countries. \n \n The hypocrisy is clearly evident in Israel's side stepping tactic of sending the documents to Washington, not Badhdad, just to make sure that the newly controlled interim government, I mean democratic body, takes a closer look at another issue that America finds oh so important. \n \n I guess it's just that old school democracy that can only find justice within itself, setting standards that are followed by convienence rather than creed. One would think that those families would recognize the paradox and have the decency to keep quiet. But when has decency ever been a normal attribute of the state of Israel anyway?\n \n http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/9C7587BA-2976-4ECA-9409-B3CA2D72515A.htm\n \n Remi",

Lets see....Denied basic himan rights, no, that is correct.....millions of them....again correct.....living under occupation requires resiliance....difficult to prove, since that is soft scince type ****, though I think there are several accounts from occupied france that would seem to back this up......superior war machine....again, true.....supported by worlds single superpower....so far they are batting 1000......never lost hope....don't know about this one, and everybody eventually wants freedom, peace and prosperity, and we all know they want an independant homeland.\n \n \nThis gives sympathy to the Palestinians and shows how they are suffering, while actaully providing no specific historical information OR ANYTHING ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE.\n It doesn't mention Israelis fears of getting on a bus for fear of being blown to peices by Palestinian terrorists.\n\n \n Take a look at some of the stories, the israeli fear of stepping on a bus..blah blah blah..is all outlined. Every article has statements from the palestenians, statements form the Israelis, and usually a \"man on the street\" prospective. What is the problem here? If you consider the # of palestenian deaths vs the number of israeli deaths, the israeli deaths are just a footnote anyway.\n \n \nIf you cannot see this is biased, then I doubt you can see anything.\n\n \n I have read worse EDITORIAL COMMENTS in the NY times, or even my local paper. If you cannot see that his is an EDITORIAL COMMENT as opposed to a reporting of the news, you are the blind one.\n \n \nThey kill innocent civilians!\n Taking this idea of \"resistance fighting\" and \"resistance groups\" anyone, anywhere for pratically any reason could be considerd resistance fighters\n.\n \n You are right, they kill innocent civilians. So do the israelis (well over 100,000 so far). Does this preclude the israeli fighters from being a \"military\"? I think that you will find that whroughout history, resistance movements have killed lots of civilians in the course of affairs. When you are facing a vastly superior force, you cannot afford the luxury of a sharply defined set of moral values. Tehse are reserved fro people who use helicopters and tanks and fighters to attack at long range, in which case they claim it was an accident. \n \n \nAl Queda under your terminology is a resistance fighter, because they are resisting the US's existance.\n\n \n AQ is not resisting our existance, simply our foreign policy. I don't think they fit the definition of either resistance fighter or insurgent, since they are not revolting against the US, nor are they under a military occupancy. I suppose it could be argued that they ARE living under an undeclared occupancy, but it wuld be something of a stretch.\n \n \nTimothy Mcvaeh (spelling) is a resistance fighter because he was resisting what he considerd an opressive US government.\n\n \n He certainly viewed himself as such. Generally such terms are used in relation ot some kind of organised movement.\n \n \nHow is the killing of women and children in Tel Aviv resistance to occupation?\n\n \n From a realistic stand point, every israeli who is not opposing the occupation is guilty. Israel is a pseudo democratic country. They could get rid of the hardliners and get people in office who would move ahead for peace instead of war mongering. \n \n If things continue as they have, israel is doomed to defeat. They simply cannot afford to spend what they have been on their military and security measures forever. Looking at the US economy, there will come a time in the forseeable future that Israel will not be able to count on the US to deliver them a big bag of gold every year. The time will come when enough israelis will have died, and they will have to admit that they cannot stop the attacks. Then the negotiating will begin. Gone are the days when the israelis could simply wipe out the palestenians. Israel knows (as does the US) that even with US support they will never again be able to wipe out Palestenians 30 or 40 thousand at a time like back in the \"good old days\".\n \n \nI'd hate to dissapoint you but \"resistance fighters\" is not correct terminology and it does not potray Hamas and other terrorist groups in Israel for what they really are.... TERRORISTS\n\n \n Again, take a look at the dictionary definition above. Terrorist and resistance fighter are not mutually exclusive. It could be argued that all resistance fighters are terrorists. \n \n \nBoth sides?\n Like when they DIDN'T mention that Hamas is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Israeli civilians?\n\n \n Exactly where do you think it would have been appropriate to insert that little tidbit? In their articles, they always list death tolls for both sides, and always tell you how many of those dead were militant (or suspected militants, as the case may be). \n \n While they dont post the total civilian death toll for the Israelis on every page, they don't do this with the palestenian death toll, either.\n \n Would you really want them to, seeing as how you are pro-israel? The most official numbers I have seen since the beginning of the conflict are:\n \n Israelis:\n 6,412 (israeli government)\n \n Palestenians:\n 169,463 (Red cross, including the 40,000 civilains killed in 2 days following the invasion of lebanon).\n \n You really want this at the top of every page? It owuld make it rather more difficult for the pro israeli folks to prove any kind of point about the Palestenains being barbarians or any such drivel.",

   "I believe alJazeera has a long history of reporting the Palestinian claims in Israeli attacks as fact, do they not? :-\\ Certainly on their TV station.\n\n \n Nope, you can almost always count on a statement from the Palestenians (usually Hamas), and a statement from the israelis (though when it involves something like the recent killing of protesters israels official comment is usually \"no comment\" for a couple of days).\n \n Oddly enough, AJ is loosing some of their viewership int he ME because it is seen as \"too western\". Al-Arabia is picking up a lot of those lost viewers, and they are real \"kill the american satan\" types. \n \n \nThis was the plan all along to get the gullible, cannibalistic Americans to go to work destroying the war effort and making all this so much more difficult for the soldiers to do their job. \n \n \n Plan by who exactly? Why wait until afterwards to question the government? If we question them now, and they are wrong, we can likely stop the killing of thousands of innocents. Whay exactly is the \"new definition of patriotism\"?\n \n \nOsama's war is not conventional war fare. The target is innocent civilians. \n\n \n The US will never see another conventional war most likely. We are too big, too powerful, and too ready to spread \"shock and awe\" when needed. If you were going to take down a 400 lb, 7 ft tall man, I certainly hope you would be smart enough to attack from behind. This is how smart people fight wars when they are vastly outnumbered and ougunned. You really expect those who would wish to oppose us to fight a \"conventional war\"?\n \n Get a clue.\n \n \nYes but we didn't purposefully target them. It is not our policy to do so. On the other hand targeting civilians is the policy of groups such as Hamas.\n\n \n The very first cruise missile we fired in the war in Iraq was at a civilian resteraunt in downtown Baghdad becasue we thought Saddam was there. \n \n We ahve relied heavily on cluster bombs during this war, including ones carrying ground penetrating, pressure activated bomblets. wht these nifty little buggers are designed to do is to burrow into the ground and then arm themselves. 80-90 pounds of pressure is all it takes to set one off (they are effectively land mines). We have used these all over the place in Iraq, including civilian areas.\n \n You might also look into studies on the long term effects of the usage of depleted uranium rounds. Iraqis will be dying for years to come from the number of DU rounds we fired during the war.\n \n Just like the other side, we will do whatever we feel we can get away with to win, regardless of the civilian casulties.\n \n \nAljazeera is biased as I have shown through its reporting.\n Hamas is a terrorist orginization and that is self evident.\n\n \n You have shown that you have some kind of preconcievd notion of the meaning of the term \"resistance fighter\" which you can't back up. The people of Hamas are certainly resistance fighters, and arguably freedom fighters. Whether or not they are terrorists has little bearing on the matter.",

I have watched AJ for a few years now and have always found their stories to be factual and informative. i have always been a little confused by people who writye them off as \"biased\" apparently without any real reason. \n \n You may note that an the US news channels, they will often show ground perspective footage with \"courtesy Al-Jazeera\" in the corner. This was always one of my favorite things about AJ. They ALWAYS have man on the ground coverage. Even when the coalition ordered them out of Iraq, their people stayed and were still providing on the ground coverage. \n \n I personally also welcome it when they play tapes that the US stations won't play, like the Bin Laden tapes. Listening to the man gives you some interesting insights into his thought processes. You don't get this from a 2 second quote.\n \n I simply don't understand why some people insist on claiming that they are biased, despite the fact they cannot find a biased story to illustrate their point (and I am not just talking about, silent). \n \n \n \nEvery news organization is biased... just to what side and what extent is the question.\n \n Obviously they'd be in a different leauge than, say, CNN or Fox.\n\n \n I'll give you this one. broker. Of course, watching other Arab language channels, I would definatly say that AJ is the Fox news of the Arab world, comparatively pro Bush, pro America, etc....\n \n I generally view AJ like I would MSNBC. Kind of middle of the road as opposed to being the communist news network or the republican parties pro0oganda network. \n \n Of course, trusting just a single source for all your news is foolish in any case. Always shop around, compare stroies, and then think and decide who is telling you the truth. It helps if you can speak a few different languages (I woud suggest Arabic and Hebrew if you are interested in the ME, Japanese if you are interested in business, and French or German if you are interested in Europe. Russian is also good to have, but time consuming to learn.)/",
