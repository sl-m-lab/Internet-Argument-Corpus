   "I'm taking this class called \"The Bible as Literature\", we're reading the Torah right now (5 books of Moses). I was just wondering what Christians think of all the contradictions throughout the bible, such as in Genesis. \n \n Examples.\n \n The creation story: One part says Man plants animals woman and another part says Man Woman plants animals (the plants animals part might be in the wrong order i'm not sure) but you get my point. How do you explain a contradiction like that?\n \n Also, God is supposed to be omniscient correct? Well if God was omniscient than why wouldn't he know that Man would need a partner? That man wouldn't be satisfied with going about looking through the animals for a mate and that God should make him another like him. Why go through all that if God is omniscient. Also, why allow the snake to \"deceive\" Eve in the first place if you know what is going to happen and that will forever change the course of human existance. Why does God say that he will kill them and then not?\n \n Also, why would God (this is really the most rediculous) KILL the entire population of the earth in a flood!?!? What the hell is that about!? \n 6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.\n Wouldn't God know this before it happened if he was Omniscient.\n \n It just seems that there are so many contradictions in the bible but I suppose it can be easily explained. The fact that so many different people wrote and contributed to the Bible and the fact that sometimes one page has 2 or 3 authors explains the differences in stories. It's interesting that God is also presented differently. One part says that god just BOOM there was the world, another part says that he slowly made the heavens and stars and blah blah....another part makes him seem kind of playful like when he is curious as to what Adam will name the animals. Also when he walks through the garden to find Adam...it personifies him a bit.\n \n Anyways I'm just making some observations as to what I've read in Genesis so far. Thoughts?",

   "Well in class this issue came up that when God (Yahweh, Elohim..whatever you want to call him), made the animals...did he make both male and female animals at the same time? Because it never really says...so if he did why wouldn't he make two different sexed humans at the same time. Why make one and then the other. But then again one parts says they were created at the same time and another part says that God realized -kind of important word there- that Adam should not be alone and that he should find a mate...he looked upon the animals and couldn't find one so God put him to sleep and took a rub blah blah.\n \n One girl also said it was interesting how Adam kind of gives \"birth\" to Eve in a sense that she was taken and made from him. Also that God never breathed \"life\" into Eve. My teacher said that he read a book where this lady claimed that when God made Adam he wasn't really a man yet and only was a man when Eve was made a woman. However, that kind of contradicts if God created two sexed animals before Eve.... \n \n My point is...it's interesting to really analyze the bible instead of just reading it for what it is because when you really study it you begin to see so many things that obviously tell you how many different people wrote the bible, why they wrote it, when they wrote it...who edited the bible? It's also interesting to look at the old Hebrew bible and than compare that to the Septuagint and compare that to the New testament. The bible is very interesting and i'm glad I can study it without religion getting crammed down my throat.",

   "Yes, when Adam became lonely and needed a helpmeet, God paraded all his freshly created animals before him in an effort to ring his dinger. But noooo...Adam, it turned out, was quite discriminating. The baboon did nothing for him apparently. The chimp was chumped, the gorilla was a no thrilla, etc.\n \n Luckily for us Adam knew better than God. At least that is the lesson we should take from that silly chapter.",

Thoughts?\n\n \n Because The Torah, the first 5 books, are completely made up. It is a work of fiction. There was a program in the late 1980's early 1990's A series of documentaries called Testament \n Testament. Antelope Films/Channel 4: London, 1988. 7 programs. \n As It Was in the Beginning\n Chronicles and Kings\n Mightier than the Sword\n Gospel Truth? \n Thine Is the Kingdom\n The Power and the Glory\n Paradise Lost\n \n John Romer goes through the Bible from begining to end and discusses how the Bible was written.
