As inflation makes itself known, normally in an abrupt manner, stepped interest increases will create chaos for the general public. \n \n I'd take increasing taxes to carry social burdens in a service economy as versus expanding national debt, as will Brown. That gives him the ability to resort to debt. Due to our political structure, we're doing it in reverse. \n \n Your economic views are far from amateurish. I've also been through what inflation and increased money supply without industrial expansion can accomplish. I'm selfish, like Brown I guess, in that a long term focus allows profit from short-term circumstances.
