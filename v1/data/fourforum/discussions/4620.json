   "Crimes against children will increase as the population of the internet increases.\n \n http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/judiciary/hju58269.000/hju58269_0.HTM\n \n Recently, highly publicized news accounts in which pedophiles have used the Internet to seduce or persuade children to meet them to engage in sexual activity, have sparked vigorous debate about the wonders and perils of the information superhighway. One report indicates that almost half of all children ages 12 to 17 use the Internet. Another study claims that 10 million children have access to the Internet. That number is expected to more than double in the next 5 years.\n \n With the advent of ever-growing computer technology, law enforcement officials are discovering that criminals roam the Internet just as they roam the streets. While parents strive to warn their children about the dangers outside the home, they may be failing to warn their children about the dangers within on the World Wide Web. Cyber-predators often cruise the Internet in search of lonely, rebellious, and trusting young people. The anonymous nature of the online relationship allows users to misrepresent their age, gender, and interests to reach into the home and befriend a child.\n \n ...\n \n \n Unlike drug trafficking, there is no one looking to take the place of an arrested pedophile. A concentrated effort at all levels, aimed at pedophiles engaged in child exploitation, could have significant impact on the problem.\n \n \n ...",
