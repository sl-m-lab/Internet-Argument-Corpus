   "I've seen a couple older posts that brought up the subject of memetics, but nothing much in the way of debate. Is this because people either take the existence of memes for granted or assume they're too silly to even discuss? For me, its an interesting subject, but for reasons that have don't have much to do with the theory itself.... \n \n I'll save myself the trouble of having to define memes and point to an older post:\n \nRichard Dawkins: Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches. Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leading from body to body via sperm or eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation. If a scientist hears, or reads about, a good idea, he passes it on to his colleagues and students. He mentions it in his articles and his lectures. If the idea catches on, it can be said to propagate itself, spreading from brain to brain.\n Memes should be regarded as living structures, not just metaphorically but technically. When you plant a fertile meme in my mind, you literally parasitize my brain, turning it into a vehicle for the meme's propagation in just the way that a virus may parasitize the genetic mechanism of a host cell. And this isn't just a way of talking -- the meme for, say, 'belief in life after death' is actually realized physically, millions of times over, as a structure in the nervous systems of people all over the world. \n \n\n \n I used the Dawkins definition since he's credited with coining the term. There are other definitions available in Anastasia's post if anyone would like to make use of them (thanks, Ana!).\n \n So...Memes. Brilliant or bogus?",

First off, I'm not a neuroscientist and if I were the answer would probably take up a thesis length paper, but I'll still try to sum up here. Input comes in from the senses and is processed through traditional neural pathways so that we can at least make sense of it. If it is new information, the brain will be able to tell because the neural imprint will be slightly different from patterns identified with older information. A neuron that receives strong signals in new patterns will physicall change its structure (dendrite growth), which by in turn altering its connections with its neighbors and establishing new connections, effectively stores new information.

You can observe this happening - I tell you something and then you know, as is the case of genetics the actual mechanism is completely irrelevant when working out most of the rules.\n \n Its the basic rule of evolution that memes are involved in - things other than genes evolve, that computer simulations can shows that actual DNA isn't needed (again, if you are interested at all, check out the Selfish Gene where Dawkins first mentions memes and describes computer modelled evolution in a different section).\n \n Fair enough, the actual application of memes is more debatable - I would say that's because we are at the same level as Mendel was, we can see something happening but we don't know why or the full extent of how it happens. But if the meme theory is correct then it means that a brain works like a computer - and that it stores bits of information that together comprise something useful. At the moment I don't think we know quite what level of information a single neuron connection codes for - whether something in the league of a bit (On/Off) or something far more complex.\n \n The importance of memes is this...without it the brain is just a big mass of connections that would be near impossible to study except of a very general way.

I show you this - and your brain will react in a certain, predicatable way to store the information.\n \n Technology and our knowledge of the brain hasn't caught up enough to be able to really apply any of the possibilities of memes - but again, the same was true for Mendel when he discovered particulate inheritance. \n At the moment its completely useless as we can't test it yet to see if its true (though without information being copied completely to the brain I can't see how you could actually use it - what rivals theories to memes are there?)",

   "You envision a future world where through the study of memetics we can customize people's brains with certain memes to enhance their knowledge. Sort of like The Matrix where Neo gets implanted with the \"kung fu\" meme and becomes a badass. Let's look at this scenario.\n \n As we both seem to agree, information coming into your brain will physically manifest itself through chemical and physical neural changes. If you want to call that a meme, fine. Will the kung fu meme entering my brain look anything like the kung fu meme entering your brain? Perhaps similar regions of motor control will be affected, but the likeness will end there. The neural framework that accepts the information in my head will be different from yours by an order of billions of neurons. Information that comes in is filtered through all the schemas I have developed before it finds physical form. This means that my neural version of kung fu - or lets make it even simpler and say my neural version of an apple - will look very much different from yours. Psychologists have been studying this phenomenon for years, looking for, say, an \"apple pattern\" that might be the same from person to person, but none has been found. Why? Because in addition to what I've talked about above, even something as simple as \"apple\" is made up of different neural components that are spread throughout the brain: in the smell and taste centers, in the pattern recognition centers, in the language centers, and probably more. \n \n As I said before, if you want to call this pattern a meme, go ahead, but since my memes and your memes for the same objects and concepts are very much different from each other, that kind of renders memes useless by your definition. Not to mention that the idea of memes replicating themselves makes absolutely no sense at this point.\n \n Your assertion that without memes the study of the brain would be nearly impossible flies in the face of decades of research that has made strides in mapping out the brain and determining how it controls not only our bodies but our \"minds.\" Granted, there is a long way to go, but if you ask your average neuroscientist how the study is coming, he or she will say they're doing just fine without memes, thank you. \n \n Speaking of which, I will leave you with a quote I culled from a cognitive psychologist not too long ago on this subject:\n \n \nI'm a bit familiar with the idea [memes] (it having invaded my cortex a few years ago) and remember thinking at the time, hmm, an engaging metaphor. I think its status among the \"mainstream scientific community,\" which in this case would be cognitive scientists, is akin to the idea of \"quantum consciousness\" in physics - i.e., those guys are WACKO, reifying (that's one of my favorite I'm-smarter-than-you words, means to make into a thing) what should remain a metaphor, without the science to go with it. The absence of serious empirical exploration reflects the absence of some realistic framework for asking concrete questions that are testable - i.e., scientific...\n \n ...here's a few thoughts about memes in particular: yes, we seem to have a talent for becoming obsessed with certain ideas or concepts, but there's good evidence that one's current cognitive framework - their \"schemas\" in our terms - is critical in what concepts will find fertile ground. Is that notion equivalent to \"good memes?\" If so, I'm OK with that. Second, selective adaptation occurs under conditions of limited resources and many competitors - but I haven't noticed an abundance of ideas (he's a third of a wit; how many more wits does he need to be a half wit?). Third, I haven't noticed that we are unable to maintain contradictory ideas about things; we can compartmentalize wonderfully, and many \"ideas\" are \"situated\" in particular contextual frames. Last, the idea of limited resources refers mostly to immediate cognition, working memory, attention etc; in long-term memory, where presumably the memes reside, no one's demonstrated any ultimate capacity or storage limits. So what's to compete for?\n",

Are they the only thing that can be used - no, clearly not.\n Its considered generally impolite to just make up peoples views like that, especially someone such as yourself who holds such bizarre opinions like that 'all cats are green one'.\n \n As to implanting Kung fu, I recognise this is probably a little far fetched and probably impossible - however something simpler like in the book Snow Crash could be realistic if there are certain basic rules. \n \n The apple pattern problem seems to me based of the techniques used - showing someone an apple and seeing what areas trigger. What is the resolution of this (i.e individual neurones or areas of the brain)?\n Whilst its not my specialilty, I have covered some of these types of study that focus on where a thing is in the brain (comparing damaged and whole brains - monitering blood flow whilst exposed to a stimulus) and I haven't heard of any method that actually looks for specific structures of neurons in relation to a peice of information, I just don't think we have these capcability yet.\n \n As for the meme, the pattern is not the meme - the information encoded by it is. If you did similar experiment on a computer you are going to get the same thing - areas will appear whe parts of a program are activated but you couldn't interpret information just by looking at a hard drives structure without knowing what you are looking at and finding a specific piece of information would be impossible without knowing what else is there or even what parts of the computer may actually hold the information we are looking for and the brain is more complicated than that.\n \n The information is clearly in the brain - and we can see the information in other forms as it enters our brains. The brain clearly must follow rules for storing information - but previous information will usually effect precisely where these parts are stored (and what they are linked to).",

   "You're putting words in my mouth now\n\n \n I'm sorry if my last argument came out that way. I thought it was fairly clear that I was just examining a logical extension of the statement you made previously: \"...you have the potential to design and alter sections of the brain.\" To me this implies the ability to implant knowledge and ideas directly into people's brains. As the kung fu argument was a little far out (for both of us, apparently), I pared it down the apple, and believe I showed just how immensely complex even that little thing was. But you diligently answered me here...\n \n \nThe apple pattern problem seems to me based of the techniques used - showing someone an apple and seeing what areas trigger. What is the resolution of this (i.e individual neurones or areas of the brain)?\n Whilst its not my specialilty, I have covered some of these types of study that focus on where a thing is in the brain (comparing damaged and whole brains - monitering blood flow whilst exposed to a stimulus) and I haven't heard of any method that actually looks for specific structures of neurons in relation to a peice of information, I just don't think we have these capcability yet.\n\n \n It's pretty fascinating to think about, I admit, but my earlier point was that it matters not how finely we're able to look at the brain, since each person's neural representation of a thing is different from one another. Each concept, each notion of the world that comes in gets placed not in some definitive neural pattern, but worked into the context of all the other connections, making each person's neural patterns unique. \n \n \nThe brain clearly must follow rules for storing information - but previous information will usually effect precisely where these parts are stored (and what they are linked to).\n\n \n I couldn't have said it better myself. :)\n \n But since we're talking about memes here all this is somewhat moot according to your following statement....\n \n \nAs for the meme, the pattern is not the meme - the information encoded by it is.\n\n \n Now we are in the realm of the intangible. There is actually a very large, interesting discussion to be had here on the nature of information, but that's another thread for another time. For now, I'll just put forth that there is no such thing as \"information\" outside of our frameworks, or our neural networks if you want to get specific. For something is only meaningful, and thus informative, once you place it in context with other things you know. To say you receive information about something is only a metaphor for saying that you percieve something that is not already in your various schemas and so you physically build it into your framework. (I could go even farther and say that perception is only a metaphor as well, but let's not get bogged down...). \n \n To directly address your comment: you cannot separate \"information\" from brain structures and activity. The information is the patterns and vice versa. When we speak of \"information\" we only use a metaphor for the way our brain adapts to the world around it.\n \n So, by at least this definition of information, we can conclude the following: Memes = Information. Information = metaphor. Memes = Metaphor. Which brings us back to where we started.",

   "I'd like to further explore my last point here - \"There is no such thing as 'information' outside our frameworks.\" It would seem there is a fault with this. But what about computers, you might ask. Who would argue that information isn't stored in vast amounts on a hard drive, and that's most definitely not inside our neural frameworks?\n \n Again, it's all about context. Here's a relevant quote:\n \n \nyou couldn't interpret information just by looking at a hard drives structure without knowing what you are looking at and finding a specific piece of information would be impossible without knowing what else is there or even what parts of the computer may actually hold the information we are looking for....\n\n \n In other words, the ones and zeros on a hard drive do not constitute information. A hard drive by itself it but a piece of metal. Only in context with the rest of the computer, the mechanisms that interpret the ones and zeros and interact with one another, do we have information. And that system is capable of making further changes to itself in response to input, so it can be said to gather information as well.\n \n Considering this, I think I should revise my point to \"There is no such thing as information outside a system which is able to place data into context.\"\n \n So computers can have information. Organisms can have information. Can any of those be said to transfer some literal form of information(/memes) between each other? No. When we communicate we re-encode that information into various patterns of sound/light/etc, which are completely meaningless by themselves and only gain meaning when they're received and processed by another organism (or computer). \n \n But since this concept is a bit long-winded and cumbersome to speak of, we go ahead and say things like \"she got information from him\" or \"I transfered information from my system to his.\" Just know that we're talking in metaphors and anything that addresses that process at that level, such as memes, can only be another metaphor itself.",

   "Will have to get back to this after having a look at it from a different angle, information may 'exist' though I think its still debated, remember seeing some thing on Stephen's Hawkings bet with another researcher (for an complete enclyopedia) as to whether information exists on its own and could therefore be destroyed/couldn't be destroyed by black holes (original bet was for existance of black holes, this is the second I think). \n \n Back to memes - but the whole pattern is not needed for a looking for in the computer we can place the peice containing the information and put it into a machine (i.e another/same computer) that converts the isingle peice of information.

The information exists in a discrete packet, we just don't know enough about the second machine to read it directly from there without using the linked machine (body) to pass it on.\n Its the same principle as an email or telephone call - the information is packaged and converted into another form for transport and then able to be converted back into a copy of the original at the other end of the line.\n The information can not disappear in between and could be read halfway (say I speak to you- information is transmitted by compression waves in the air and then through the ear to chemical and electrical and eventually into the brain where the information can be interpretted - however the information must be within the sound wave and not relying on the receiver seeing as we can record it on a mircophone whilst it is travelling).\n \n Energy doesn't exist outside a context, but is obseved tranferring between objects - I don't see why information can't be a similar thing in a way (there are physical laws governing information's behaviour in the form of entropy).",

Real, existing things.\n \n \n \n I'm not sure anyone is suggesting memes are anything other than a convinient label for how communication i.e. sensory input, can lead to physical changes in an organism, and how this \"sensory input\" is like a package, a virus if you will, that actually moves symbolically from one host to another.

   "I have the sneaking suspicion that we're starting to go around in circles here, but I'll try to address some issues here for one last go around.\n \n \nBack to memes - but the whole pattern is not needed for a looking for in the computer we can place the peice containing the information and put it into a machine (i.e another/same computer) that converts the isingle peice of information. I don't need the entire computer, or all the information in it if I only want one picture from it. Because we know what we are nformation into a form able to be read by another (the brain). The information exists in a discrete packet, we just don't know enough about the second machine to read it directly from there without using the linked machine (body) to pass it on.\n\n \n Apologies if I'm wrong, but I think I understand what you're trying to say here, which is: a specific chunk of data on a disc will represent a picture regardless of whether the computer is there to interpret the data or not. Is this correct? Consider if I were to write a program that retrieved that specific chunk of data. I could write a program that interprets the ones and zeros into pixel data which is displayed on my screen and wa-la, I have my picture. Or.... I could write a program that intreprets that same set of ones and zeros into audio signals which are turned into vibrations in my system's speakers and instead of a picture I have an aural experience. Same data. Different context. Different information. \n \n How does this relate to memes and the brain? Instead of ones and zeros we have neural patterns, but the principle is the same. Suppose you could implant a picture meme into a brain the same way a laser burns at a disc (this goes against everything else I've argued, but what the hey?). Everyone should have the same picture in their heads, right? Actually, a great many people will have totally different perceptions of the information we place in their heads. Consider a condition called synesthesia. These folks' brains are wired differently, much like the different program we wrote earlier. They mix up visual information with aural, tactile information with taste, and so on and so forth, and no two individuals do so in the same way. So information that's supposed to be a picture might to them might be rendered as a series of sounds, or a bitter taste, or even a particular odor. Same pattern. Different context (different brain). Different information. \n \n Information is data placed in context. There are no \"discrete packets\" of information going back and forth between you and I here. To get an idea to me your brain has to utilize many functions culminating in your fingers typing, which gets turned into electronic signals which themselves get split up hundreds of times, circling the globe before they get to my computer where they're converted into light patterns which my brain receives, filters through its comprehension routines and stores in spacial and temporal patterns (which is another whole issue I really haven't gotten to here) that are unique to me. This, to me, is a very messy process, and not discrete at all, not to mention that \"discrete\" implies something that is going specifically from somewhere to somewhere else, yet hundreds of other people are reading this thread and picking up these concepts as they go back and forth. To me, an example of a \"discrete packet\" would be a photon. It is a single unit of light (nevermind the whole wave/particle thing) that goes specifically from somewhere to somewhere else, affecting an atomic change where it strikes. There is no such thing for ideas or memes.\n \n \nthe information must be within the sound wave and not relying on the receiver seeing as we can record it on a mircophone whilst it is travelling\n\n \n Again, I could create a receiver to pick up those sequential air compressions and interpret them as visual signals instead of noise. Come to think of it, this is exactly what animals do that use sonar, yes? If I were to sing to a bat at a high pitch, it might experience a barrage of distance and landscape information. The same air compressions amount to different information to different species, or even the same species if you consider the synesthesiests. The air compressions contain no information on their own.\n \n To sum up:\n Data going between you and me contains no information. Only when we process it and place it in context does it amount to information. The contextual neural pattern that represents the \"transferred\" idea in my head is physically unique to myself since everyone filters information through their own schemas, and my framework is different from everyone else's. This theory of information transfer and storage has no need for, and is indeed at odds with the concept of discrete packets of information transferring themselves between systems. This also precludes the notion of those packets somehow reproducing, evolving and spreading according to some vague evolutionary principle, save at a metaphorical level. Yes, you could say that an idea mutates slightly when I run it through my filters and store it, and then I spread that mutated idea to others. But such an assertion has absolutely no scientific value, and such can be said about memes.\n \n \n Talking through this subject has helped me articulate and clarify some important concepts to myself. Thanks for the help. :)",
