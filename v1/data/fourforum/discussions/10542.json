   "===< Click here to view the Do you love your GOD picture <===\n \n Last Sunday, GOD gave me the idea for this message during Pastor Scott Borden sermon (Click here to visit the First Alliance Church's Site). During his message, Pastor Scott made this statement, \"When you LOVE someone you TREASURE what they TREASURE\". In other words, you're willing to watch over and protect the things the people you love care about. \n \n After thinking it over, I gotta BELIEVE there's MORE to his message than what he talked about. By that I mean, \"If you love someone, you'll NOT ONLY care about the things they care about but you'll also care about the gifts they give you.\" I know that's true because I've notice how much my mother cares about the gifts she's received from her children. Even a couple of the outdoor plants that HAVEN'T amounted to much so far. Every time she sees them she says something like: that's the plant Betty gave me. She DON'T have much but what she cares about most are the things that were given to her by people she loves. It's the THOUGHT THAT COUNTS and who gave them to you not how expensive or pretty they are.\n \n Anyway Pastor Scott's sermon and GOD'S thoughts got me to thinking. I've always had a HARD TIME defining love and who I love. I've also wondered if I love GOD. And I've wondered how I could tell? Thanks to Sunday's sermon and GOD'S inspiration, I know the following questions will give you and me the answer : \n \n ---------------1st - WHAT ARE the GIFTS and TREASURES GOD gave you and me? \n \n ---------------2nd - DO WE LOVE GOD?\n ---------------(If we LOVE HIM we take care of the GIFTS and TREASURES HE gave us.)\n \n To answer the second question, you have to answer the first question first. We'd be a FOOLS to presume we knew what is important to GOD. But WE should be able to figure out what GIFTS and TREASURES HE gave us. As humans, we'll NEVER know what's MOST important to GOD. HE knows about things we'll NEVER know about. So what's MOST IMPORTANT to HIM might be something we've NEVER heard or seen. So I WON'T WORRY about that. GOD will help me find that answer if HE wants me to know it.\n \n So let's answer the first question first:\n \n ---------------1st - WHAT ARE the GIFTS and TREASURES GOD gave you and me?\n \n For the answer, all you have to do is read the first Chapter of the first book of the bible. GOD gave Adam all the animals of the world to be his company. HE even let Adam name all the animals. HE also made everything we could see, smell, eat and drink. When that wasn't enough to make Adam happy, he created Eve and gave us the ability to raise our own families.\n \n Now we can answer the second question:\n \n ---------------2nd - DO WE LOVE GOD?\n ---------------(If we LOVE HIM we'll being take care of the GIFTS and TREASURES HE gave us.)\n \n I CAN'T answer that one for you but I can say the world as a whole ISN'T taking care of the GIFTS and TREASURES GOD gave us like we take care of the treasures and gifts that the ones we love give us. So I'd say as a whole man DOESN'T love GOD as much as we love the ones closest to us. If we did, our rivers and streams WOULDN'T be polluted. If we did, NO ONE on earth would be going without because GOD LOVES THEM and we'd be taking care of the people and things that HE LOVES because they would be important to us too. If we LOVED GOD we'd be reading and studying HIS MESSAGES in the bible. HE gave us that TREASURE and GIFT too. I'm NOT EVEN going to talk about war. I DON'T have all the facts to KNOW if the war in Iraq is justified. Remember, the American president used BAD INFORMATION to justify the war. If he DIDN'T have the RIGHT information when he made his decision, I CAN'T assume I have the RIGHT INFORMATION. The REAL PROBLEM is that we DON'T know each other and treat each other the way GOD wants us to. If we did know each other better; shared our GIFTS and TREASURES; and helped each other, I bet we WOULDN'T need or want any more wars. The problem is those with more will have to SACRIFICE like bible (GOD'S WORD) taught us, so those without WON'T have to go without. That's what GOD wants us to do and if WE LOVE GOD, we'll do what makes HIM HAPPY.\n \n So thanks to Pastor Scott's sermon and GOD'S inspiration, I know I LOVE GOD. I do my BEST to take care of HIS GIFTS (people in need, plants, animals, water, air, ...). Now it's time to for YOU to decide if you REALLY LOVE GOD. Take the DO YOU LOVE GOD TEST by answering the following questions:\n \n ---------------1st - WHAT ARE the GIFTS and TREASURES GOD gave you?\n ---------------(I already helped you with that one.) \n \n ---------------2nd - DO YOU LOVE GOD?\n ---------------(Remember, if we LOVE HIM you'll be taking care of the GIFTS and TREASURES HE gave you.)\n \n Once you've answered those questions, you'll know how much you REALLY LOVE GOD or should I say how important GOD is to you.",

   "If you cannot love an eternal torment god (without links)\n \n For the first 500 years of the Christian church, universal salvation was the prevailing doctrine of a large majority of the Christian church. To find the evidence that this is so, type into Google\n books prevailing\n \n Universalism The Prevailing Doctrine Of The Christian Church During Its First Five Hundred Years\n \n The author, J.W. Hanson wrote \"The purpose of this book is to present some of the evidence of the prevalence in the early centuries of the Christian church, of the doctrine of the final holiness of all mankind. The author believes that the following pages show that Universal Restitution was the faith of the early Christians for at least the First Five Hundred Years of the Christian era. He has aimed to present irrefragable proofs that the doctrine of Universal Salvation was the prevalent sentiment of the primitive Christian church.\n \n The salient statements and facts in all which will be found in these pages show that the most and ablest of the early fathers found the deliverance of all mankind from sin and sorrow specifically revealed in the Christian Scriptures.\" And they were reading the Bible in its original language.This online book also explains why and how this changed. \n \n Up until now, after reading this post, many believers in eternal torment have said something like, \"I truly sympathize with your sufferings, but it's what the Bible says that matters, not whether or not it makes you suffer.\" That's why I want to say right at the outset that all of the links referred to but not posted here show that a correctly (literally, not interpretively) translated Bible actually teaches universal salvation, not eternal torment, or even annihilation.\n \n I'm 69 years old. The idea that God lets anyone suffer forever has caused me more suffering, including a twelve year nervous breakdown 1966-78, than all the other sufferings of my life combined. \n \n This suffering was caused by the fear produced by not being able to love a god who would let anyone suffer forever and wondering what this god would do to me for not being able to love him. Even though I was and am trusting for my salvation in what Jesus accomplished by His death and resurrection, through the power in the blood of His cross, I was, and still am unable to love a god who would let anyone suffer forever.\n \n You can Google up many similar testimonies by typing in\n tentmaker hells fruit (small case letters)\n \n If you are like me and cannot love a god who would let anyone suffer forever, you can Google up THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD SERIES and find out that a literally (not interpretively) translated Bible actually teaches universal salvation, not even annihilation.\n \n THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD SERIES (Google it up)\n \n THE GOD THAT CALVINIST AND ARMINIAN ETERNAL TORMENTORS PROFESS TO LOVE\n \n The eternal torment theology of the Arminian Christian relies on so-called \"free will\" and luck.\n \n The god that Arminian eternal tormentors profess to love says to his fallen creatures\n \n \"Unless you are lucky enough to find out about my son during this lifetime, and even if you are that lucky, if you don't have the good sense to cooperate with my son properly before you die, then I am going to raise you from the dead and I will sustain you alive in an inescapable state of eternal torment forever.\"\n \n The eternal torment theology of the Calvinist Christian relies on God alone, not \"free will\" at all. It is summed up by the word TULIP: Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, and the Perseverance of the elect.\n \n The god that Calvinistic eternal tormentors profess to love says to his fallen creatures\n \n \"I created most of you for the purpose of torturing you forever. However, I am going to choose a few of you undeserving ones to go to heaven where you will be happy forever.\" John Calvin said there will be infants a span long in hell because they were not among the elect. (A span is the distance between the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger.)\n \n And then both the Arminian and Calvinistic eternal tormentors say that the feelings that they have for this god of theirs is \"love.\"\n \n To read a description of eternal torment combination Calv-Arminianism Google up ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE IN JESUS CHRIST \n \n Without God's sustaining power everyone would cease to exist. So if anyone were to suffer forever, our all-powerful God (Who is Love in essence, not just loving) would be fully 100% responsible for it. We would have to conclude that any definition of the manifestation of \"love-in-essence\" includes eternally sustaining people alive in an inescapable state of suffering.\n \n What a travesty; what a revolting definition of love it is that God, Who is love personified, would grant any creature a will so strong that they can choose themselves into an irreversible state of never ending suffering (Arminian), or deserve to suffer forever just by being born into the human race (Calvinistic).\n \n Thank God the Bible does not teach such insane ideas! Yes, God is just but He is not justice personified. However, God is Love personified. That is why He will temper all of His administrating of justice only to be for the good of the individual being judged.\n \n Here is what the God that universal transformationists love and worship with complete abandon will do. He will complete the process of salvation for the first fruits of election, (the remnant chosen by grace), after the first resurrection. Then He will complete the process of salvation for the non-elect after the great white throne judgment. For some, it will include an experience in the lake of fire.\n \n Jesus died on the cross and rose from the dead to guarantee that any necessary \"kolasis aionian\" (age-during corrective chastisement) will be 100% effective in changing wrong attitudes. All acts of sin have been forgiven for everyone. Attitudes cannot be forgiven. Attitudes must change. This is what the lake of fire which is the second death will do. It will last no longer than God sees is good for everyone involved. Google up\n lake of fire eby\n \n You can also Google up good articles on this subject by typing in kolasis aionian\n \n Or, they will go to the search engine at the top of TENTMAKER (Google it up), and will type in a key word or phrase from any argument or scripture passage. Ten articles will come up refuting the claim that the Bible teaches eternal torment. Then they may click to the next page and ten more articles will come up, and so on and so on for many pages. \n \n This was the information that enabled me to recover from a twelve year nervous breakdown 1966-78, and it gives me great joy to keep learning that it is helping more and more other people too!! I'm 69\n \n I am also going to guide you to the testimony of a man whose experience was almost identical to mine. Even the thought processes that took him into, through, and out of his breakdown are the same as mine. His name is Charles Slagle. He responds to the question, \"Which view of salvation is true?\"\n \n You can Google up his answer by typing in \n ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE IN JESUS CHRIST",

   "\"THE EONS OF THE EONS\" (plural/plural) COMPARED WITH \"THE HOLIES OF THE HOLIES\" (plural/plural) \n \n There are several analogous expressions in the Scriptures which should show the meaning of the words under discussion. In Ex. 26:33, tou hagiou ton hagion, \"in the holy of the holies.\" This is similar to the \"eon of the eons\" of Eph. 3:21. In II Kings 8:6 we see, eis ta hagia ton hagion, \"for the holies of the holies\"-similar to \"eons of the eons.\" The \"holy of the holies\" and \"holies of the holies\" refer to the tabernacle. Psalm 44:7 says, ho thronos sou ho theos, eis ton aiona tou aionos, \"Thy throne, O God, is for the eon of eon\"-similar to Heb. 1:8. Daniel 7:18: \"until eon of the eons\" and similar to that of Eph. 3:21, where a singular is followed by a plural, \"eon of the eons.\" In these expressions we see the eons corresponding to the holies in the tabernacle.\n \n While there are many different teachings on the types in the Tabernacle of Moses, it should not be too difficult to see that there were at least five divisions: (1) without the camp; (2) in the camp; (3) in the court; (4) in the holy place; and (5) in the holy of holies. These may be likened to the five eons we find in the Scriptures (past eons, present eon, future eons). The last eon is called the \"eon of the eons,\" because it, like the \"holy of holies,\" is the climax of the others. In Hebrews chapter 9, the Greek text of Nestle reads (margin v. 25), eis ta hagia ton hagion, \"into the holies of the holies,\" and (v. 3), hagia hagion, \"holies of holies.\" \n \n Just as the two holy places in the tabernacle are called the holies of holies, so the last two eons are often called the eons of the eons. As the tabernacle illustrated man's approach to God, it corresponds closely with the eonian times, which also brings man to God. The \"holy of holies\" was a single holy place. The \"eon of eons,\" a single eon. It was the pre-eminence of the \"holy of holies,\" in relation to the other holy places, which caused it to be so designated. So the pre-eminence of the \"eon of the eons\" lies in its being the fruitage and harvest of previous eons. The same is true of the \"holies of the holies\" of Heb. 9:25. They may be likened to the \"eons of the eons\" of Rev. 11:15; 22:5. Luke 1:33 says of Christ's \"kingdom there shall be no end.\" While the kingdom itself will not end, the reign of Christ for the eons of the eons will end when He delivers up the kingdom to the Father (1 Cor. 15:24-26).",

To argue against the understanding that there are souls cast into the lake of fire forever, universalists look to extra-biblical works to support their arguments against the Greek word for \"eternal.\" They quote such and such said this and who and who thinks this, and so on and so forth. They exhaust all their resources to refute this because, quite literally, if the word does indeed mean eternal in regards to the after life, the age to come, the case for Christian universalism evaporates before their very eyes.

No one comes to the Father except through Me.\n \n 1Ti 2:5 For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus,\n Can you show in the gospel itself where it say's that everyone is saved whether they accept Christ or not? Not where it say's that Christ died for everyones sins, because we know that He did that. But that all are saved whether they receive Christ's free gift of salvation or not? It is understood that salvation is a free gift, but that it must be accepted in order to be received. It isn't just a blanket covering over all the sins of humanity in perpetuity.\n \n And if people who don't even acknowledge God are automatically saved, how do you reckon that belief with this warning?\n Hbr 6:4 \n For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,\n Hbr 6:5 \n and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,\n Hbr 6:6 \n if they fall away,[fn2] to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame.\n Those who never acknowledged salvation through Christ were never enlightened at all, so how do you overcome this inconsistency regarding universal salvation?",
