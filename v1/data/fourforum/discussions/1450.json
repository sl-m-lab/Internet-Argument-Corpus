But such labels are somewhat irrelevant, as whatever punishment one gets for being immoral don't apply to God. \n\n \n I wrote to a born-again friend of mine for an answer to this very type of question (as posed by Mizmaxx on the \"Islam\" thread). I will give you his response, which makes sense, to me.\n \n Now, a sceptic reading the OT may say that even though God describes himself as just and as such, he is wrong. God claims to be compassionate and merciful, but his actions (in ordering the destruction of the Canaanites for example) are 'evil'.\n \n How can we respond to this charge?\n \n 2. The theological angle - the sceptics claim that God is evil shows that\n they do not understand the context of God's judgement on the nations. The two most important elements in that context are CREATION and SIN.\n \n a) CREATION (Genesis 1-2) - from the point of view of the OT, God is the\n sovereign creator of all that is. Everything and everyone owes its very\n existence to God. God sustains the universe and every human being. If he stopped doing so, the whole thing would collapse in a second and we would all be destroyed. This puts things in perspective. Who are we to claim that God is evil? How come we, the mere creatures, get to make up the standards or right and wrong? God is the creator. He defines goodness and justice and right. Further, none of us have any claim on God. He is under no compulsion, except that of his own character, to be merciful to us. He is completely within his rights to do whatever he wants with us. We are HIS creation.\n \n b) SIN (Genesis 3) - On top of that, we have to remember that even though we owe our whole existence to God, each of us has rejected his rule over our lives. Like Adam and Eve, all of us have rebelled against him, even though we owe him everything. We are like two year olds who tell our parents we hate them and then try to run away from home. Doing so is both wrong (the two year old owes its existence to its parents) and stupid (a two year old can't survive 5 minutes without its parents!).\n \n In this context we would expect God to wipe out the entire human race as a failed experiment. We should NOT be surprised when he judges, but we should be surprised when he is merciful, because mercy is the last thing we deserve. In the specific case of those people in the OT whom God destroys, they are always people who have rejected his rule over them, rejected his people Israel, and lived in wickedness and rebellion. They are not 'innocent'. A good example is the Pharaoh in Exodus 4-15. God continually warns him that he should free the Israelites from slavery, but he continually and obstinately refuses. When God finally destroys him and his people, it is only after repeated warnings and pleadings to stop being so rebellious.\n \n And there is more:\n \n 3. The 'whole Bible' angle - in order to understand God's judgement on\n people in the OT, we have to take into account the story of the whole Bible, and in particular, the climax of the story in Jesus Christ. When we\n understand this context it becomes clear that God chose the Israelites for a reason. He did not choose them as his 'chosen people' arbitrarily. All along his plan was to bring salvation to ALL people through the Israelites (this is clear in God's original covenant with Abraham in Genesis 12.1-3).\n Throughout the OT then, the Israelites were God's vehicle for bringing\n blessings to the nations. This is why it was such a sin in the OT to oppose the Israelites. To oppose them was to oppose God's peace mission to you. But so many of the nations roundabout, having rejected their creator, then rejected the people through whom he had chosen to bless them. This double rejection of God and his plans to bless them is what earned the nations God's judgement (as if the original rebellion wasn't enough!!)\n \n When we get to the New Testament, we see that God fulfilled his plans to bring blessing to ALL peoples through one Israelite in particular, that is, Jesus Christ. Through his death (when he took the punishment for our sins) and his resurrection (through which he defeated death), God has now opened up the way for all people to be forgiven and reconciled to him, their creator.\n \n Since God's plans have now been fulfilled, this now means that many of the commands of the OT are simply out of date. They don't apply anymore (Jesus said so, for example, in Matthew 15). On thing in particular which doesn't apply anymore is that the Israelites are no longer God's chosen people. the purpose of God choosing them has now been fulfilled because salvation and blessing has been brought to everyone through Jesus' death and resurrection.\n Therefore, the way people oppose God's plans to bless them today is not by rejecting the Israelites (as the OT nations did), but by rejecting Jesus.\n When people ignore or reject Jesus they are rejecting the only way of\n forgiveness that God has provided for them. And, just like in the OT, there will be terrible judgement for people who continuing rejecting God even to the point that they reject his offering of peace in his son, Jesus. But, like in the OT, God would much rather forgive than judge. That is why he has not brought the final judgement yet. The apostle Peter says that God is holding off his judgment to give people time to repent and turn to him so that he can forgive them (2 Peter 3.1-11). That is what he would much rather do.\n \n But the judgement will come, just like it did in the Old Testament. So if\n the God of the Old Testament is evil, then the God of Jesus and the NT is\n evil also, because he also judges. In fact, Jesus talked often about God's\n judgement, and Christians believe in hell on Jesus authority, because he\n talked about it alot. So there is no 'good' God in the NT and 'evil' God in\n the OT. God is the same throughout the Bible. He is gracious and\n compassionate and loves to forgive. But because people reject him and ruin his world and hurt other people, he is also a God who judges. God's\n judgement, far from being itself evil, is actually a good thing because it\n rids the world of evil and the suffering which it brings. But judgement for\n God, in the OT and now, is always a last resort, he would much rather\n forgive. that is why he sent his son to die for us.\n \n \nHowever, I'd like to address something said above equating atheism with absolute moral relativism. This doesn't make sense, and indeed the entire secular humanist movement tries to create moral law via logic and reason.\n\n \n On what basis? How do they determine 'good'?",

If he stopped doing so, the whole thing would collapse in a second and we would all be destroyed. This puts things in perspective. Who are we to claim that God is evil? How come we, the mere creatures, get to make up the standards or right and wrong? God is the creator. He defines goodness and justice and right. Further, none of us have any claim on God. He is under no compulsion, except that of his own character, to be merciful to us. He is completely within his rights to do whatever he wants with us. We are HIS creation.\n \n\n I have serious problems with this take on things. Even accepting the claim (we owe our existance to God), I dont think the impact u give can be logically derived from it. Sure, God doesn't have to do anything he doesnt want to. But capability and morality are seperate concepts. The fact that no one is there to tell God \"stop!\" is not relavent in judging moral culpability.\n You then assert that God defines good etc. Fine, lets assume God defines good/evil. I don't dispute it (for the sake of argument at least). The point I was trying to make was that if God makes moral law, then if God violates his own precepts then he is, by definition, immoral. Thus, when God says \"don't murder\" and he murders, he is immoral not by human but by divine definition. To make this more practical, simply take the situation of a senator. He gets to make the laws about what folks can and can't do. But he is still in violation of said laws if he breaks them. I don't accept that being a creator gives one absolute authority over the creation. That seems highly patriarachal, hierarchial, and quick to justify all sorts of abuses.\n \n \nIn this context we would expect God to wipe out the entire human race as a failed experiment. We should NOT be surprised when he judges, but we should be surprised when he is merciful, because mercy is the last thing we deserve. In the specific case of those people in the OT whom God destroys, they are always people who have rejected his rule over them, rejected his people Israel, and lived in wickedness and rebellion. They are not 'innocent'. A good example is the Pharaoh in Exodus 4-15. God continually warns him that he should free the Israelites from slavery, but he continually and obstinately refuses. When God finally destroys him and his people, it is only after repeated warnings and pleadings to stop being so rebellious.\n \n OK, one this assumes that the penalty for any act of disobdience against the creator could be death (to carry your analogy, do u kill the 2 year old that runs away? Do you even consider that a tool in the toolbox?). But taking my two examples, you don't address Job (where are Job's sons committing any wrong?), and RE: Exodus you miss a very key section that reveals, in my view, a large part of God's character. In Exodus, basically, what happens in most of the plagues is this sequence of events\n 1) Plague happens\n 2) Moses says let my people go and Pharoah says ok\n 3) Pharoah changes his mind\n 4) repeat to top.\n The interesting thing occurs in part 3. Because pharoah changing his mind is not of his own volition. Instead, the bible says specifically \"and God hardened Pharaoh's heart.\" That is, Pharaoh didnt let the Israelites go until God let him let them go (presumably this is so God can impress the Israelites and thus reinforce their faith. There is an old Jewish story that the failure of this tactic of \"big miracles\" as proven by Mt. Sinai/Golden Calf caused God to switch tactics, instead of a few big miracles, he gives us small ones every day). But once again, this misses the point. Even granting the Egyptians culpabiltity, even if you dont buy the above analysis, that still doesnt change the fact that God killed INNOCENTS. To quote my patent pending line from 6th grade \"what about the 2 year old?\" the two year old first born son hasn't had time to sin, hasn't oppressed, is at this stage not doing anything wrong, and still dies. Murder without cause = sin by God's own standard.\n \n The last part doesn't clash with my analysis, and really is somewhat inapplicable to the feelings/sentiments of this jew :)\n \n 3) Atheism and moral standards.\n First, I said they were trying, not that they were succeeding :). But here's my personal work on the matter.\n Moral judgments, are, almost by definition a priori. We take guesses on what is \"right\" and \"wrong.\" In an amoral world, one would be free to do anything, but as everyone knows this literal freedom isnt substantive freedom (my \"freedom\" to act can be restricted or taken away by whoever teh biggest bully on the block is). So, in order to form a stable society, we necessarily restrict at least some liberty. The problem comes in deciding what liberties and how much. Since there is no real warrent to restrict liberty (again, our moral claims are really just guesses) I propose two main guidelines.\n 1) the restrictions on absolute liberty must serve the purpose of expanding substantive liberty\n 2) the restrictions on absolute liberty must be the narrowest ones possible.\n The way one goes about this (and my personal philosophy) is the Harms Principle, articulated by John Stuart Mill. What he says is that one has the absolute liberty to do whatever one wants, so long as it doesn't infringe on someone else's liberty (AKA, my right to wave my fist ends at your nose). This meets the requirements, it is the narrowest possible restriction on liberty, because it only restricts absolute liberty when it conflicts with substantive liberty. And none of it needs a theological root!",

   "Parcum,\n \n \nOf course God knew- but the evil came on it's own. Once again, God had ONE will on what the world should be like. This will included having free will. THis free will is the knowledge of good and evil. He gave us freedom- in return, the ability to do evil.\n\n \n So if I create a situation in which I KNOW something horrific will happen, I am not in any way responsible?\n \n \nEither way, however, your logic is senseless. Because you don't like it, it doesn't exist?? What??\n\n \n I never claimed that because \"I don't like it\" that it doesn't exist. I am not aruging for my atheism here.\n \n \nWhy do you believe in evidence? What evidence do you have that there is no God? There is no logic in atheism!\n\n \n Thats nice. But this isn't the topic.\n \n Montalban,\n \n \nI thought you said you didn't believe in 'evil' just 'negative' consequences.\n\n \n Sorry for being misleading. I often speak as if I have a different view point. I am trying to point out a contradiction between calling God all loving and saying that the same God created the world in which we now live.\n \n \nTell me, where did you see God loading up the trains of Jews to take them to the death camps? Did you see Him unloading them and guiding them into the 'showers'?\n Where did you see God acting in the killing of the Jews? I'd be interested in seeing your evidence, especially as you don't believe in God.\n How did he 'create' the scenario?\n\n \n Once again, if I create a scenario in which I know that something horrific would happen, am I not partly responsible?\n Yes of course I am.\n \n Dsadevil,\n \n \n have you ever read \"Grendel\" by John Gardner? The section with the Dragon helps explain how knowledge of the future doesnt = eliminating free will.\n\n \n I don't claim to beleive that the knowing of the future eleminates the possibility of free will.\n But I haven't read it...\n Too much to read and not enough time.\n \n \n \nIf God makes moral absolutes, then God is bound by them, and thus if he violates them (don't murder) then he is immoral by his own judgment. Which makes sense, because there is no reason why God is \"Good,\" nor is there a reason why he should be \"good.\" What is God's incentive to be good? He is amoral in the sense that moral judgments don't impact him. In otherwords, God can be labeled good or evil from act to act, even using his own standards. But such labels are somewhat irrelevant, as whatever punishment one gets for being immoral don't apply to God. \n \n \n You bring up a good point. But with this you must agree that God cannot be labeled as all good.\n \n Dreamweaver,\n \n \nI suggest that you check the doctrine of the Trinity on the Internet.

   "Epaphras_faith,\n I just find it a bit wondersome (sp) why God would require or desire three different parts to function. I don't consider three to be one.\n \n \n\n \n One could say that man has three different parts, Body, mind, and soul. \n \n The concept of mind as something more than chemical process is a fairly old psychology concept. It includes the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and that it effects and changes that from which it comes. Psychologists call it \"Emergent Downward Causality\".\n \n It certainly is wondersome to be three and one. A paradox. But then, that would make sense that it is a paradox to us and not to God. Have you ever read \"Flatland\" by Edwin Abbot? An excellent book. More of a social commentary than anything. It is very old and about 80 pages. An easy read but fascinating. \n \n He describes a two dimensional world. In it live lines, and polygons and circles. To be a cirlcle is to be clergy and the highest form of life. The more sides you have the higher your class (circles are considered to have infinite sides). Lines (no sides) are the women in the story. They are treated very poorly and are required to walk sideways so they can be seen. If they walk front to back they could kill someone by impaling without being seen. (As I said, social commentary).\n \n In this world lives a square. One day something strange happens. A sphere decides to interrupt the day of this square and speak to him. The square has no concept of up or down so only sees a point on the ground (where the sphere intersects the square's plane). When the sphere speaks the square hears the voice coming from...........inside of him. Then the sphere grabs the square (with what appendage I have no idea) and lifts the square through the dimension called \"up.\" The square sees a succession of circles, first growing in size then diminishing and then in reverse.\n \n The point (longwinded) is that why would you expect God to conform to what you know? If He is infinite, then Time and space would have only partial meaning to God. If He is the Alpha and Omega, then time would be something He is outside of and sees both ends equally. It is like me looking at my desk and seeing the whole thing. Why would it have to be a paradox for God. It is for us, but that is a very limited point of view. Even if you subscribe to the idea that God does not exist, then at least science has put forth the idea of multidimensions. All of which we cannot understand.\n \n Do you know what a tesseract is? We see three dimensions built on three geometric axes (X,Y,Z). All of these are at right angles. If there is a fourth dimenision (W) then it would also intersect at a right angle.
