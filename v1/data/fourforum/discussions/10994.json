The consumer advocate also blamed tax and other corporate-friendly policies under the Bush administration that he said have left many lower- and middle-class people in debt.\n \n \"You take that framework of people feeling locked out, shut out, marginalized and disrespected,\" he said. \"You go from Iraq, to Palestine to Israel, from Enron to Wall Street, from Katrina to the bumbling of the Bush administration, to the complicity of the Democrats in not stopping him on the war, stopping him on the tax cuts.\"\n \n \"In that context, I have decided to run for president,\" Nader told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"",

(You know, just dental care, in some parts of the country, has been compared by American medical professionals to third world conditions. We are no longer the leaders we once were. And we are continuing to nosedive, in part, because we do not address this issue.) We have lost control of our healthcare system. People aren't getting health care. People can't pay for health care. \n \n You are paying instead for what we don't receive.\n \n Indeed, the costs for universal health care would be negative:\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyJ5cHLuXuM&NR=1\n \n As for Iraq, I agree that Congress has not delivered as expected by voters who sent them in as Democrats to get us out. But where the logical connections in that to the problems in our broken health care system, and how to redress it?\n \n Consider the real implications to what you are saying:\n \n (1) The money we pour down the drain in Iraq could be used to provide medical care to every American; and\n \n (2) Congress' repeated failures of action only point to how pressingly we need leadership on health care from someone exactly like Hillary Clinton. A person who has spent decades working for universal health care for all Americans, has obtained health coverage for so many, including 6 million children through SCHIP ... has a demonstrated record of commitment to the issue and under repeated fire.\n \n Hear about Hillary Clinton from those who know her best:\n \n http://www.thehillaryiknow.com/",

Ask an Aussie, some of whom boast of having the best health care system in the world.\n \n Did you even link the buzz words that shiver you to the soul? Here's a sample of what the American Medical Association says about your dreaded \"individual responsibility\":\n \n Key reasons for requiring individuals to purchase coverage \n include: (a) achieving universal coverage; (b) avoiding adverse \n selection, whereby low-risk individuals opt out of insurance, \n driving up average costs and premiums for those who are \n insured; and (c) avoiding the free rider problem, whereby care \n for the uninsured is ultimately paid for by the rest of society \n through higher taxes and higher premiums.\n \n http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/478/indivresponsibility.pdf \n \n Does that make sense? Let's just say, rather, you've got it backwards. For, if you are not covered, a lot of people are paying for you. \n \n \n That's funny. \n\n \n No, it's not funny. It's criminal and tragic. Over 600,000 Iraqis are dead, an entire nation is devastated, tens of thousands of American veterans are permanently disabled - and many of them are unable to obtain sufficient health care, thousands of American soldiers have come home in coffins, we are trillions in debt .... and all while 18,000 Americans die every year on American soil because they do not have sufficient health coverage or care, while 47 million (and still growing) are uninsured, with 80 percent working adults, and 20 percent, children.\n \n Yet every wealthy industrialized nation in the world today, with the sole exception of the United States, insures health care for all its citizen. They live free of fear that, if they get ill, they can't get medical care, or, that medical care will completely bankrupt them and destroy their lives.\n \n While tens of millions of your fellow Americans do live with that fear in their lives.\n \n Your fears are not real, nor do they have any factual basis. Their fears, however, do have a factual basis, and, are real. While we can well afford to do it differently. We cannot afford not to.\n \n Tell me, Snakespit, are you even aware of a health care problem in our country?\n \n From the first part of your post:\n \n \n [...] I will go to my psychic with tincture of bat toe and boil it in mystic oils before she rubs it on her crystal ball. She foresees: Wealth redistribution. \n\n \n If you mean, that I think just a tiny fraction of what we've spent on Iraq is better spent on universal health care, and could easily fund as much, yes, we should, and yes we can.",

Which obviously impedes natural conception. Another effect is that children who are born become autistic - the frequency of autistic children increases clearly with the amount of Mercury consumed. And there are other effects of this additive which is called thiomesal - such as diabetes. \" \n \n So, any vaccine containing Mercury, is a defertilization drug.\"\n \n Most likely, Rockefeller wanted mercury put into vaccines as a population control method.\n \n http://www.newstarget.com/z022014.html\n \n \n Vaccines\n \n \"Think vaccines are safe? You've been hoodwinked by the popular media parroting drug company propaganda. Vaccines are preserved with methyl mercury, one of the most dangerous chemical forms of the toxic heavy metal. This mercury is injected directly into the bodies of children where it causes severe neurological damage. And yes, it does cause Autism, despite what you've read in the dumbed-down press. Only a fool would inject their child with mercury-preserved vaccines.\" \n\n \n Actually, it's Thimerosal, not Thiomesal. And if the author had done his/her homework, they would know that since around 1998-2001, the FDA and CDC had encouraged drug manufacturers to devise preservative free vaccines. All of my youngest daughters vaccines were Thimerosal free. From the FDA website:\n \n \nAt present, all routinely recommended vaccines for U.S. infants are available only as thimerosal-free formulations or contain only trace amounts of thimerosal (&#8804;1 than micrograms mercury per dose), with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine. Inactivated influenza vaccine for pediatric use is available in a thimerosal-preservative containing formulation and in formulations that contain either no thimerosal or only a trace of thimerosal, but the latter is in more limited supply;\n \n \n http://www.fda.gov/cber/vaccine/thimerosal.htm#guid\n \n And to my knowledge, methylmercury has never been used as a preservative in any vaccine. Methylmercury is the known organomercurial that is commonly found in fresh and saltwater fish such as large tuna, swordfish, and shark. The author may have meant to say ethylmercury, but then again, would still be wrong. Ethylmercury is a metabolite of Thimerosal, not the actual preservative itself. Ethylmercury has not been shown to be bioaccumulative like methylmercury.",

I read the whole article, but those 2 paragraphs were the only I took the time to pick apart. I'm sure if I took the time to go back through and read, there is plenty of other information that can be shown to be fiction as well. \n \n \nHowever, my reason for sharing the site -- his survey of some of the research on our 37th ranking internationally for health care, which is not at all laughable (unless you're a middle-schooler), the sources being quite reputable. \n\n Apparently not.\n \n \n Note that in addition to average life span, we are also being outpaced from our former status regarding infant mortality rates.\n\n You act as if universal health care will cure all the ills in this country. It will not. Proper diet and excercise would probably save and prolong far more lives than universal health care...and they are free. Keep in mind, that not everything will be gumdrops and lolipops with universal health care.

It's basically 6 deaths per 1,000 live births in each country. The USA has 26.43 times the population of Cuba. I'm sure if Cuba had the population of the US and was spending $500 a year per person on healthcare, people would be dying left and right.\n \n The bottom line is, and this has already been said in this thread, anybody in the US who needs care can get it. The people who have insurance pay for them to get care. Antonia already admitted as much. So the question is, why do we need to get the government involved? People like Michael Moore advocate socialized healthcare while bashing HMOs. Too bad HMOs were created and are funded by the federal government. They are chock full of federal regulations and red tape and, for once, I actually agree with Michael Moore. The HMOs are horrible. Socialized healthcare is simply an HMO for everyone, which will most likely be mandatory.\n \n No thanks.",

It's hardly a fault of governmental structure that people elected Reaganite XXXXXX.\n \n As for the claim of getting healthcare if you are uninsured, unless I'm very much mistaken that is only emergency care, and you will usually be pursued for the bill afterwards. This means someone often leave treatment as late as possible, hoping it will go away on its own, and preventative care will be non-existent.

Again, there's a huge difference in keeping us safe and making sure we've all got cable TV. Furthermore, I haven't heard anyone (H or O) say that they would withdraw troops and defund the war. Actually, the Dems could do that today if they thought it was the best thing to do for the country.\n \n Again, I'd like to reiterate that taking money (property) from someone, ie. forcing them to hand over the fruits of their labor, so that someone else can sit at home and work on creating more mouths to feed should not be the function of the govt.

   "Let's think about the impact of conservative policies verses the use of government to regulate business in the public interest and to bolster the economy. The latter ideas were NOT started by FDR. They went back further, to the Progressive Reform movement of 100 years ago and even before that. Progressives and labor activists challenged the conservative doctrine of laissez-faire. They worked for government regulation of business. Their efforts produced laws setting maximum hours of work, minimum wages, health and safety regulations in workplaces, the banning of child labor, the breaking up of monopolies and trusts, the regulation of monopolies and trusts, regulations to protect the safety of food and drugs. Progressives also fought for conservation legislation, for setting aside lands for public use and to protect wildlife. \n \n After World War I, the federal government returned to a conservative, pro-laissez-faire approach, and Republican Presidents promoted no government regulation of business and the cutting of taxes exclusively on the wealthy. What was the result of this smaller government, pro-laissez-faire approach to governing? The Great Depression. The policies of the conservatives gave us 10 years of Depression and a collapse of the capitalist system.\n \n FDR stepped in and used the federal government effectively to rescue democratic capitalism. Not all New Deal programs were effective, because they were trial-and-error efforts, and most New Deal programs were temporary. But FDR resumed and expanded the approach of the Progressive reformers by using government to intervene in the economy, to regulate business, to protect workers and ordinary people, and to provide a safety net for people who, through no fault of their own, were thrown into poverty and in many cases destitution. \n \n What were the positive long-term results of the New Deal? We have Social Security, a program that is so popular today with the elderly that conservatives have been unable to strip it away by privatizing it or even privatizing part of it. We have the tradition of government action to stimulate the economy and prevent depressions. Even conservatives today believe in this. We have government regulation of banks and the stock market, and government insurance for bank deposits. We have government price supports for farm products, which, while always controversial, have enabled farmers to survive. And the Wagner Act enabled workers in industries to unionize in the late 30s and early 40s, thus turning what had been poor workers into middle-class consumers who in turn helped the economy by consuming and were able to send their children to college. These highly paid industrial jobs have mostly now disappeared with globalization, and that has undermined the American economy and the well-being of American workers generally. \n \n Since the New Deal, we have added federal government programs that remain highly popular, such as Medicare and government-funded loans and grants for college students, and Head Start. These programs are popular because they provide real benefits to people and enable people to live well and to get ahead by going to college. Children from poor families are given a chance to learn more at an early age with Head Start. These programs have not made people lazy. They have given people a chance. \n \n The problem with the conservative vision of small government and no government assistance to people is that it leaves many people out, in a capitalist system that seeks to drive down wages in the quest for profits. That tendency, as we have seen, leads to depressions, because low wages undermine the ability of ordinary people to consume. A degree of government redistribution of wealth helps the economy by promoting consumption. That's why tax breaks given now are NOT aimed only at the wealthy, as they were in the days of Calvin Coolidge and Andrew Mellon. Even conservatives recognize that we need to promote consumption, and to do that, we need to give tax breaks to middle-class and poor people, who do the bulk of the consuming. \n \n One of our biggest challenges today is providing health care to all Americans. And the only way to do it is to use the government. Even Mitt Romney realized that, as he signed into law a bill in Massachusetts that mandates universal health insurance and uses government to help provide universal health insurance in the state. He later disavowed his own health care achievement in Mass. as he tried to sound more conservative in the Republican Presidential race, but he apparently didn't appeal enough to the conservatives in his party, and he dropped out.\n \n I think we are seeing a push from the grassroots not for less government, but for government to step in and provide all Americans with access to affordable health care. This is the wave of the immediate future, I think.",

   "Well, I agree with you to some extent, there. At least, in the shorter term. But this is also one reason why it makes little sense, to me, to blame Nader for the Democrats' self-inflicted problems. \n \n Now, both Democratic candidates' presence in the general election will  (unlike Nader) do much to alter that.

It's not sexist or whatever other nonsense that you and others seem to think. It's her personality.\n\n \n Oh please. Whatever you may personally think or feel, or however it suits your interests to rationalize this for your candidate, it's politics. The bottom line is that many in the Obama campaign -- mostly the more privileged white supporters -- have thought they could exploit a fundamentally right hate campaign against Clinton. And do so regardless of hurting the people whose interests she represents. Because those persons, being more vulnerable in certain respects, meant they could get away with it. But it's obvious they can't. We're moving further into the twenty-first century, dear.\n \n As for who doesn't like who -- plenty of people don't like McCain and plenty of people don't like Obama and plenty of people don't like Nader etc etc ad naseum. \n \n As far as that poll is concerned that I just pasted from, Clinton and Obama are in exactly the same place nationally, relative to McCain. So start thinking twice, Obamites.\n \n Hillary, Girl, this one's for you:\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ogb3NHtTvw&feature=related",
