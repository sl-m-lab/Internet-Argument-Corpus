   "You claimed to have proof of god, some undeniable logical train of thought that actually proved God's existence.\n \n That would require one good argument.\n \n Instead, you have decided to serve us up with 500 poor arguments you have dredged out of the sewers, that aim to convince by virtue of their great numbers, because no one can be bothered to refute them all.\n \n So firstly, I would like to point out that you are a liar. You claimed to possess a proof, you do not. I have no \"respect\" for this thread whatsoever, and in your lengthy first post you wasted so much time preparing we don't have any argument for god at all - just preaching about the \"dangerous\" people who disagree with your worldview and the merits of apologetics (supported by scripture).\n \n People don't dislike apologetics because it is \"rational\", people dislike apologetics because of its deceitfulness and shady tactics, which you have illuminated for us once again.\n \n Either give us ONE good argument, let's see if it holds up, and then if it doesn't, you can try again. Trying to circumvent debate by drowning the opposition in every poor argument you can find is simply disgraceful.\n \n And what the hell is this doing in a thread supposed to be proving god\n \nThe correct theological term for those who label themselves \"liberal\" or \"left wing\" or \"progressive theologians\" is \"heretics\"\n\n \n Why would a logical proof of god be littered with insults towards \"liberals\", am I to expect the garbage dump of arguments which is to follow to be littered with cracks about \"homos\" and \"sluts\"?\n \n If you want respect, you earn it, but so far you have done quite the opposite.",

   "[quote]\nLASTLY THANK YOU FOR SPOILING THE CONTINUTIY OF THE THREAD. YOUR DENMAND\n \n \n \n WILL NOT BE MET UNTIL EITHER YOU DELETE YOUR POST OR IT IS REMOVED\n \n BECAUSE I SIMPLY WONT WASTE MY TIME AND EFFORT ON PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHO HAVE NO RESPECT.\n\n \n Actually it won't be met whether I do delete my posts or not, since you possess no such argument. \n \n Thank you also for illustrating the \"joy and peace and love incomparable to anything in this world\" Christianity brings to you, your posting style certainly reflects the character of a man who is at peace with the world.\n \n Perhaps when you pray tonight you could ask Conservative Jesus to send you a new caps lock key, as it appears yours is broken.",
