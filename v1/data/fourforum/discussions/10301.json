   "This thread follows on from a discussion elsewhere, in which I said I would consolidate the issues I have with EAM as it has been described to me.\n \n I'd like to preface my comments with a bit of personal context. I'm often accused of being a 'darwinist', the implication being that I am emotionally shackled to a particular philosophical perspective. This is not the case. Accusations of being a 'materialist' similarly have no teeth in this discussion, for the very simple reason that if a Vital force exists and can influence the physical world then it too belongs to the natural and material, rather than the supernatural. Materialism would simply expand to accommodate it, as it has with other forces.\n \n What I am is someone who appreciates the value of the scientific methodology, and its repeatedly demonstrated power to yield elegant, testable, useful and predictive hypotheses, including - over the past centuries - the discovery and modeling of novel forces at work in nature as well as the Theory of Evolution. If you plan to set that methodology aside in favour of something else, I would want the payoff to be commensurately spectacular.\n \n The Inference of Vitality and its Nature\n \n In my most recent discussions about EAM, WW has provided a more detailed manifesto regarding the link between Vitality and physical form. His contention is that certain physical configurations of matter are analogous to a 'key', accessing and subsequently motivated by a corresponding aspect of the vital force, which according to WW explains why that matter behaves differently to that of inanimate objects.\n \n There are a number of anomalies here.\n \n First, WW is effectively saying that certain configurations of matter, motivated by the Vital force, are behaving differently than they would under the physical forces alone. But the comparisons WW uses are not like for like: they are between living and dead/inanimate entities that are physically different, leaving open the possibility that the difference in behaviour is explicable by the physical forces acting upon different configurations of matter.\n \n Nor can WW say what the behaviour of biological matter would be if not motivated by Vitality. He cannot point to a chemical reaction inside a cell and say: \"look, if it weren't for Vitality's intervention right there, this would have happened instead according to the physical forces\". It's all very well talking in high-level terms like autopoesis and teleology, but at the end of the day to accomplish anything Vitality is going to have to get its hands dirty and move some molecules around. So where are the molecules that are breaking the laws of physics?\n \n At this point, WW abandons scientific methodology entirely by saying that he does not need to know how biological systems would behave under the physical forces alone. Since his whole case for Vitality's existence is grounded upon the alleged observation of behaviour violating the established laws of physics, it seems unlikely in the extreme that this 'observation' can be accurate if WW does not know what he is distinguishing that behaviour from.\n \n Wheels Within Wheels\n \n In addition to these flaws in its premise, EAM has demonstrated a propensity to accumulate epicycles in an attempt to resolve internal contradictions, discrepancies with evidence, and unexpected and unwanted deductive deviations from WW's philosophical vision.\n \n For example, WW has stated on many occasions that it is impossible to create life from non-life; impossible to create a Frankenstein's monster. However, this did not follow from his recent depiction of physical configuration enabling the activity of vitality upon the matter in question. If that is the case, then in principle at least, constructing an organismic replica of sufficient fidelity ought to result in life behaviour.\n \n WW's response to this deduction was to accuse me of making the 'unfounded assumption' that the circumstances necessary for vitality to start acting upon matter billions of years ago are still present today. However, since EAM did not include any statement that circumstances had changed in the past until after I pointed out the contradiction, it's clear this is an epicycle contrived to avoid having to retract or qualify an earlier statement. Moreover, the plain fact that organisms create life from non-life all the time by ingesting dead and inanimate matter and configuring it into replicas of themselves strongly argues against WW's earlier statements. Failing to do WW's job of adding epicycles for him is not 'making an unfounded assumption'.\n \n When queried about the contradiction of how the first physical 'key' was moulded by the force that lies beyond the 'lock', WW modified EAM again, saying that Vitality actually acts upon all matter to some degree, not just 'living' matter. However, since according to EAM access to Vitality defines what is living, and Vitality has also been described as quantum in nature - you have it or you don't - it's not clear how there can be any such thing as\n 'non-living' matter according to this new rule. Not a lot more has been said on that particular subject, I suspect because it's a can of worms to which WW is reluctant to return. It is worth noting that WW's philosophical bias forced him to eschew the one semi-reasonable avenue of escape: that the first, very, very simple physical 'key' arose by chance and was seized upon by Vitality.\n \n Other epicycles have included:\n \n 1. The quiet retirement from public view of the original mantra of organismic response -< epigenetic inheritance -< genetic change, and its replacement with a system whereby the organismic response itself can be the induction of stochastic genetic mutations.\n \n 2. The introduction of the 'just in case' hypothesis, whereby bacteria induce mutations adaptive to potential future environments just in case those environments arise. This epicycle was added in response to incontrovertible proof that mutations were arising in growing populations prior to exposure to selective environments. While this could conceivably make sense in the case of life-or-death resistance to antibiotics, it makes absolutely no sense at all for lesser, easily survivable variations. The idea that a bacterium would intelligently cripple itself now just in case one particular environmental change out of billions were to occur at some point in the future is not rational; akin to throwing yourself down a flight of stairs just in case the nurse who looks after you in the hospital turns out to be the love of your life. The observable fact that people occasionally do fall first down the stairs and subsequently in love with their nurses - a net gain for them - is not, as WW would have us interpret random mutations, evidence that they do it on purpose.\n \n 3. Also during a discussion of mutations preceding the environments to which they are adaptive, the assertion was made that the traits in question were not arising anew, but were in fact being 'remembered' from earlier generations that had been exposed to the same environment. At first, this gigatonnage of genetic history was described as being stored communally at the colony level. The analogy was made with neurons collectively encoding memories. However, this epicycle was impatiently ripped out and replaced with slightly different one when it was pointed out that colonies grown from a single abstracted bacterium also seemingly 'remember' these mutations, disallowing the possibility of communal storage. Instead, these genetic memories are now stored entirely non-physically (that is, not involving matter in any way, even as an encoding medium) and once again, I was at fault for making the unfounded assumption that this wasn't happening.\n \n Just as with the Ptolemaic system of cosmology, all these epicycles are starting to get very messy, and are introducing their own contradictions besides. For example, EAM asks us to believe that bacteria can 'remember' mutated genes they don't physically possess, over unlimited generations, while being clearly incapable of remembering what those mutations actually did, since there is no evidence of mutations being chosen to fit the circumstances. The 'just in case' hypothesis also treads on the toes of the 'apparently random mutations are actually a heuristic search' claim. All in all, it's become increasingly clear that EAM doesn't really care what's going on, so long as it can continue to claim it's happening on purpose.\n \n With Friends Like These...\n \n Finally, much of the evidence cited in support of EAM is actually devastatingly bad for it. A case in point is the hypermutational response of some bacteria to stress. WW seizes upon this as proof of EAM at work. We can immediately dispense with the 'A' part, since the mutations are not statistically biased towards success, but that's not the whole story by a long way.\n \n The Catch22 for EAM is this: if Vitality motivates the organism to adapt and induces mutations, why would an organism need physical mechanisms like the SOS response to leverage error-prone proteins in times of stress? On the other hand, if the physical mechanism is necessary, and the organismic response it produces is required for evolution to proceed, how could the mechanism have itself evolved? \n \n To put it another way: if organismic response is necessary, then how did the physical hypermutation mechanisms that enable that response evolve? If the answer is 'Vitality created them' then the physical mechanisms are de facto unnecessary; vitality was pushing evolution along just fine without them. And while it's easy to see how a stochastic hypermutational stress response mechanism could be beneficial in a Darwinian model (ie, to an organism otherwise passively relying on environmental mutagens to supply it with variation), it's much harder to see how it would be an upgrade in the world according to EAM, where organisms are already intelligently designing their genes.\n \n And in conclusion, read my lips.\n \n EAM is described as an attempt to formalise the philosophy that something 'drives' life, that volition or purpose are quantities that exist in their own right, rather than being labels we give to behaviour emerging from the interaction of other forces. And there's nothing wrong with that; it's at least worth talking about. But WW's surpassing personal hostility and contempt toward classical evolutionary theory - his conviction that it must all be wrong in every respect - has thrown EAM in front of one train after another, until the roughly-stitched and bleeding mess that remains bears no resemblence to the clean and elegantly-worded - if scientifically lightweight - hypothesis he brought to this forum.",

   "Basically EAM fails because it views the process from the end result point of view and then overlays human behaviors and capabilities on top of what is observed. \n \n An organism is observed after several million years of evolution and the result is an interesting set of adaptations which IN RETROSPECT seems to represent some sort of deliberate rational design because thats the way the observer would have carried out the process. All the observer sees of couse is the RESULT not the process behind it. To see the result as being the product of design and intention is the easy way out in a cognitive sense. To grasp the process from the other end - namely going back to the origin of the adapataion and asking how the result came about is more difficult and challengning. WW simply takes the easy way out and attributes intention, foreknowledge, and will to organisms as simple as bacteria. This is HIGHLY irrational and is in effect a refusal to deal with the extreme weakness of the EAM idea.",

The fact of evolution, as descent with modification from one or a few common ancestors, predates darwin by hundreds of years, and is not the private property of materialism/mechanism/darwinism.\n\n Well to start its a theory not a notion. Secondly if everybody already agreed on common ancestry with modification as the means whereby the species arose then why did anyone every think Darwin had anything new and novel. Simple explanation is he explained HOW such descent might be accomplished in a rational and testable context and provided significant evidence and analysis supporting his scheme. In other words his basic scheme coheres while the alternatives fail to do so.\n \n \nThe real \"payoffs come from 2 sources--the understanding of inheritance that grew out of Mendel's inheritance theory, and the concept of dynamic systemic 'adaptation', as opposed to passive particulate 'selection', in evoltion.\n\n \n What in the name of heaven is \"passive particulate selection\" is that found in quantitative genetics in some obscure corner - I challenge you to produce a reference to the term in the open literature. And Mendel's theory was itself (if anything is) particulate in nature and it was NOT derived from Darwin at all. It preceded Darwin and later of course DID serve as a plug in addition to supplant Darwins own inadequate theory of inheritance. And of course Mendel is long ago supplanted by much more detailed and modern genetic knowledge.\n \n As to \"dynamic sytemic adaptation\" I also suggest you need to document where that term originates from other than yourself. Just what does that mean which is NOT covered by the vary-select-inherit process? Please tell us oh mighty lagomorph how antibiotic resistance arises by \"dynamic systemic adaptation\" instead of plain old VSI processes and how you distinguish the two.\n \n [QUOTEHave to go now.[/QUOTE]\n \n Good because my tolerance for people who pontificate in pseudoscientific terms while pretending to themselves that they know what they are talking about is wearing very very thin.",

I like it a lot, and for several reasons. I come to such debating rooms as this bb in order to debate. That means, a/finding someone with opinions that conflict with my own, and b/finding an opponent who can debate like a mature adult, relying on facts and logic to present his/her case.\n \n Finding opponents ,a/, who will defend darwinism with all the fervor of ideological zealots and fanatics is easy--they make up 99% of all darwinists who post to internet debating forums. Engaging darwinists who fulfill the conditions of b/ is next to impossible. Many start out rationally and with their emotions under control, but very rapidly become no different from the common herd after they've had their assumptions and dogma shot down more than once. They very quickly become 'froth at the mouth' trolls who think that insult and personal attack constitutes legitimate debate. Such people are nothing more, intellectually speaking, than a pain in the XXX, and need to be ignored as much as is possible. You, almost entirely alone, have, to this point, resisted the temptation to turn into an irrational, splenetic, pin in the XXX,as are the ovwerwhelming majority of this board's regulars. However, if you are about to 'go over to the dark side' with the rest of them, that's up to you. I'll miss debating you.\n \n \n\n and from the options available to explain that disagreement you alternately choose 'Peeling is stupid/simple minded'\n\n \n **\n Sorry to hear you say this. I have never attacked you personally, never said anything like what you accuse me of saying. I have characterized certain ideas, notions, and opinions as stupid and simple-minded, but not you personally. If your personal identity causes you to believe that an attack on those ideas is an attack on you personally, than obviously what I've been saying about your personal commitent and emotional involvement with materialist/mechanist/darwinist/atheism is spot on the money.\n \n \n\n and 'Peeling is driven by an emotional, philosophical imperative' -\n\n \n **\n Which is true, [see above], but which is nothing to be ashamed of, since it applies to anyone, including myself, who feels motivated to debate philosophy. And although many darwinists kid themselves that they are here to debate 'science', they are not. They are here to defend their metaphysics and its place in their personal psychological identity, i.e., ego, against the metaphysics of others, just like everybody else.\n \n What is so very strange and unnatural, IMHO, about many materialist/mechanist/positivist/darwinist/atheists is that they will go to great lengths to deny that that is the worldview that their ego revolves around, and will always attempt to convince themselves and others that they are actually somebody else. Somebody utterly uninfluenced, psychologically, by any worldview, any metaphysic, any particular set of unconscious assumptions and prejudgements, at all. The rest of us are proud of the intellectual sub-strate upon which our opinions are based, be those opinions open to challenge or not. So why are materialist/mechanist/darwinists so often ashamed of being identified as such? Beats me. \n \n \n\n the former because it's always a handy and ego-inflating explanation for disagreement and you don't have any respect for other people's intellect anyway,\n\n \n **\n Well, there it is.

I do not debate stupid people, there is no challenge in it. Nor do I debate arrant foolishness and irrational notions such as biblical literalism. It's no more challenging than shooting fish in a barrel, and no more satisfying than destroying a child's faith in the tooth fairy.\n \n But I do take offence at you characterizing my ability to reason logically and to think with some originality as being nothing more than 'manipulation' and sophistry.\n \n \n\n I do think you are ignorant of much that would beneficially inform your hypotheses,\n\n \n **\n True, but then, who is not? Yourself, perhaps?\n \n \n\n that you cherry-pick just that evidence which seems to support your preconceptions rather than critically applying your hypothesis to all the available evidence,\n\n \n **\n Not true. I most certainly do apply EAM to all empirical observations of biological originality, just to see if it still applies. To date, it always has.

What materialism has done, under a long series of name changes, [the last being 'naturalism', if I'm not mistaken], has been to desperately rationalize the evidence of actual reality in the form of 'forces' and other phenomena antithetical to its principles and assumptions by pretending that what it says isn't what it means. For example that its denial of all things immaterial and incorporeal and insubstantial doesn't apply to forces, mass, energy, and so on. All very darwinian SOP.\n \n \n\n I explicitly described science as a methodology, not a philosophy.\n\n \n **\n Science is more than a methodology. Empiricism and validation by prediction from anticipated regularit is its methodology.

But 'should' is not the issue. The fact is that, falsely and irrationally, you and other materialist have tried, and with great success unfortunately, to convince the public that your materialism and 'science' are one and the same.

If you say something to me about how Vitality works, and I say 'that's a stupid / simple-minded idea', are you seriously telling me you wouldn't take that as a personal attack? \n \n \nIf your personal identity causes you to believe that an attack on those ideas is an attack on you personally, than obviously what I've been saying about your personal commitent and emotional involvement with materialist/mechanist/darwinist/atheism is spot on the money.\n\n \n If I were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong, you might have a point. But I don't; never have, so far as I recall. An idea can't be stupid, or simple-minded. An idea can be right or wrong, or perhaps partly both. When you describe an idea as stupid, you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that. When you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple-minded to think that.\n \n \nWhich is true, [see above], but which is nothing to be ashamed of, since it applies to anyone, including myself, who feels motivated to debate philosophy. \n\n \n But I'm not debating philosophy, WW; I'm debating evolutionary theories.\n \n \nAnd although many darwinists kid themselves that they are here to debate 'science', they are not. They are here to defend their metaphysics and its place in their personal psychological identity, i.e., ego, against the metaphysics of others, just like everybody else.\n\n \n So you're not wrong; everyone else is a liar.\n \n \nSomebody utterly uninfluenced, psychologically, by any worldview, any metaphysic, any particular set of unconscious assumptions and prejudgements, at all.\n\n \n Rather like how a scientist should aspire to behave, really.\n \n \nWell, there it is. You have 'gone over to the dark side'. Too bad. I hope it's a temporary lapse, but if not, our debate was quite good while it lasted.\n\n \n I think I've been remarkably patient so far, actually. I made a simple personal statement to qualify my opinions, and you have decided that I'm lying or deluded because that better fits the image of 'darwinists' you like to think you're debating. I've endured with very little complaint regular comments deriding my intellect, and even kept my temper when hours of painstakingly constructed logical argument and evidence is completely ignored or dismissed as 'blowing smoke' because you can't come up with a better response.\n \n The idea that I'm the one somehow teetering on the brink of civilised debate, and should mend my ways lest I topple into your personal oubliette... I think you need a quick perspective and soda.\n \n \nSez u. Your problem being that when you assert the assumption that your philosophy, [materialism, etc.], mirrors reality, my reasoning repeatedly shoots it full of holes, and, quite understandably, that ###### you off. \n\n \n Nothing you've ever said regarding classical evolutionary theory has ever '######' me off, because in every case you have demonstrated contempt-fuelled ignorance of what it actually states. The number of incorrect statements you've made about what 'darwinists think' or 'darwinists believe' or, quite recently, what darwinists' materialist ideology 'forces them to assert' is large and increases daily. And so long as you continue to batter your pet strawman of the ToE in preference to tackling the real deal, I won't have to 'defend' anything; I'll just have to keep on correcting the same old mistakes.\n \n \nBut I do take offence at you characterizing my ability to reason logically and to think with some originality as being nothing more than 'manipulation' and sophistry.\n\n \n The value of logical reasoning is dependent upon your axioms. Highly religious people are no less capable of reasoning logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exists enters into every equation. For you, one axiom is the existence of Vitality; volition made quantifiable, and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect.\n \n There is no logical reason for you to deride NS the way you do; it's an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be; the occurrence of mutations, volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own. But your axioms prevent you from incorporating it into EAM and getting on with your life.\n \n \nNot true. I most certainly do apply EAM to all empirical observations of biological originality, just to see if it still applies. To date, it always has.\n\n \n That's because it's not a falsifiable hypothesis. No matter what happens to an organism, you will always be able to say it happened on purpose.\n \n The observations you cherry-pick are those you use when attempting to prove that darwinian evolution cannot work. So you ignore the countless studies where variation is unambiguously stochastic and focus on the very small number which seemed initially to show non-random mutation. You ignore the countless studies where adaptive mutations arise, and can be elevated by carcinogens, in the absence of any hypermutational organismic response, and focus only on those where it does occur.\n \n \nWhy not? Why would you doubt me? Unfortunately for your express denial of the materialist metaphysic as the philosophical view that informs the opinions you are trying to promote, that denial is worse than dubious, it's ridiculous.\n\n \n So you are truthful, but I am a liar. Just like you are clever, but I am stupid. You have no respect for me, WW; I've never seen you demonstrate respect for anyone.\n \n \nYou can 'describe' materialism in ways that are untrue, \n\n \n You mean, in ways that are different from your pet version? WW, what defines materialism - the phenomena it recognises - if not their susceptibility to the scientific method? \n \n Science is more than a methodology. Empiricism and validation by prediction from anticipated regularit is its methodology. If science were nothing more than a methodology, than no science would exist beyond the confines of any particular experiment and/or collection of observations/measurements undergone currently.\n \n \nHowever, you are right, in so far as 'science' _should not_ be conflated with and confused for any particular philosophy, with the possible exception of empiticism.\n\n \n Then you concede that EAM is not scientific, since its premise is philosophical.\n \n \nI \"pretend\" to nothing. I am not \"pretending\" to beilieve you to be a materialit/darwinist. I do believe exactly that.\n\n \n Excuse me, I stand corrected. For 'pretend' please substitute 'wrongly believe'.\n \n \nAnd as for your threat to make my arguments look silly, I'm not shaking in my boots. I've made your arguments look presumptuous, pretentious and silly, but you have never yet succeeded in doing that to any of mine.\n\n \n Well, we can agree to disagree on that one. I won't bother putting it to a vote :)\n \n \nIt's up to you. Stop bringing up red herrings and/or arguing by personal attack, or don't expect me to treat your posts with any less contempt than I have for most of what's been posted to this board.\n\n \n Evidence or logic that causes you a problem is not a red herring. As for arguing by personal attack, once again I think I've been remarkably patient given the unending stream of dismissive and insulting comments I've endured along the way.",
