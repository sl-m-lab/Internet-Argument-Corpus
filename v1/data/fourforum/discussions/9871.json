   "Zardoz, fear not, Benedict XVI is on the march and will save your faith:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/world/americas/10pope.html\n \n May 10, 2007\n Pope Opens Trip With Remarks Against Abortion\n By IAN FISHER and LARRY ROHTER\n S\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil, May 9 - Benedict XVI arrived in Brazil on Wednesday, starting his first papal trip to Latin America with strong words against abortion, and roiling a Catholic continent increasingly divided by the issue.\n \n On the plane from Rome, Benedict appeared to go further than the Vatican had before on the contentious issue of Catholic politicians who favor abortion rights. He seemed to suggest that Mexico City legislators who recently voted to allow abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy had excommunicated themselves.\n \n \"Yes, the excommunication isn't something arbitrary - it's part of the code\" of church law, the pope said in Italian, in response to a question during the first full-fledged news conference of his two-year pontificate. \"The killing of an innocent human child is incompatible with going into communion in the body of Christ.\"\n \n The pope's spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, quickly issued a clarification that played down his words, but then issued a statement approved by the pope that seemed to confirm a new gravity on politicians who allow abortion.\n \n \"Legislative action in favor of abortion is incompatible with participation in the Eucharist,\" the statement said, and politicians who vote that way should \"exclude themselves from communion.\"\n \n The deeply divisive issue has surfaced in Italy, Spain, Britain and the United States, where in the 2004 presidential election, several bishops said that Senator John Kerry, the Democratic candidate and a Catholic, who supports abortion rights, should not receive communion.\n \n According to church law, those who play a material role in an abortion should not receive the sacrament of holy communion. In effect, they have automatically excommunicated themselves from sharing in communion. (Much rarer, and more complicated, is an active declaration by the church of excommunication.)\n \n Inside the church, that automatic excommunication is understood to apply to women who undergo abortions and medical personnel who perform or assist in them. But there is a debate inside the church over whether that also applies to politicians who support abortion laws.\n \n Father Lombardi's initial clarifying statement said the pope had intended to refer to current Vatican policy, as expressed in a document on the Eucharist that Benedict issued in December. In that document, Benedict said that certain values, including protecting human life from conception to natural death, were \"not negotiable\" and that Catholic politicians had a \"grave responsibility\" to promote such laws.\n \n On Wednesday afternoon, Benedict, who is 80 years old, arrived here in S\u00e3o Paulo, the largest city in South America, for the start of a four-day trip, his first as pope to Latin America, where nearly half the world's Catholics live. Under chilly gray clouds, his chartered Boeing 777 landed here after a 12-hour flight from Rome.\n \n He was greeted by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who is weathering his own abortion maelstrom.\n \n The controversy began Monday, when Mr. da Silva gave an interview to Roman Catholic radio stations in which he said he was of two minds on abortion. Though personally opposed, he said, as president he believes that \"the state cannot abdicate from caring for this as a public health question, because to do so would lead to the death of many young women in this country.\"\n \n Except in very limited and specific circumstances, abortion is against the law in Brazil, which has more Roman Catholics than any other country. Nevertheless, estimates of the number of illegal abortions performed annually here, in clandestine clinics known in Brazilian slang as \"angel factories,\" run between one million and two million.\n \n But the minister of health, Jos\u00e9 Gomes Tempor\u00e3o, suggested in March that legislation calling for prison sentences of up to three years for women convicted of having illegal abortions should perhaps be altered. He called for a national referendum, which led to attacks from pulpits across the country and to a protest march on Tuesday in Bras\u00edlia, the capital.\n \n And on Tuesday, after the president's initial remarks, Dr. Tempor\u00e3o described abortion as \"a theme that should be treated delicately,\" and complained that \"some sectors of the church have made declarations that are very aggressive and quite distant from the teachings of Jesus.\"\n \n That drew a caustic rejoinder from a spokesman for the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops. Dr. Tempor\u00e3o's job is to be \"the minister of health, and not of death,\" said the spokesman, Bishop Ang\u00e9lico S\u00e2ndalo Bernardino.\n \n But the minister of women's affairs, Nilc\u00e9a Freire, weighed in to support her colleague. \"I think it is important that the church or religious or fundamentalist groups not act as censors of a discussion that society needs to have,\" she said.\n \n The Brazilian church's senior cleric, Cardinal Geraldo Majella Agnelo, also condemned government policies on reproductive health, which have won praise from international public health groups. He singled out sexual education and condom-distribution programs, which have helped cut AIDS transmission rates.\n \n \"This is inducing everyone into promiscuity,\" Cardinal Majella, who is the departing president of the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops, said in an interview with the Portuguese-language service of the BBC. \"This is not respect for life or for real love. It's like turning man into an animal.\"\n \n President da Silva is scheduled to meet here with the pope on Thursday. The president's press spokesman, Marcelo Baumbach, said that while abortion was not on the government's agenda, whether the matter is broached \"is going to depend on the dynamic of their private conversation.\"\n \n For Mr. da Silva, a 61-year-old former labor leader, abortion has been an extremely sensitive issue.\n \n He is the second youngest of seven children of a poor peasant family, has eight other half-brothers and sisters, according to local press accounts, and had to drop out of school at the age of 12 to go to work to help support his family.\n \n Later, as a factory worker here, he fathered a daughter out of wedlock.\n \n When he first ran for president in 1989 as candidate of the left-wing Workers' Party, the mother of the girl went on television to say that he had encouraged her to have an abortion, an accusation that is thought to have contributed to his defeat in the runoff vote that year.\n \n \"No one is in favor of abortion,\" Mr. da Silva said Tuesday, as the controversy was intensifying. \"But the question is: should a woman be imprisoned? Should she die? It's necessary to look at the woman as a human being.\"\n \n Laurie Goodstein contributed reporting from New York.",
