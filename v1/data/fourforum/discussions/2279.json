A couple of people at my school are on the Pagan path and both of the are \"weird\". I'm not trying to say anything about Pagans but they don't fit in to the groups at school.\nI'm not surprised they are different. To be a Pagan in a Christian dominated society you must make an active stance in breaking with tradition and 'normality' by definition. It is therefore understandable that they wouldn't 'fit in' as seamlessly as others. Of course this is a generalisation, but still true to an extent.\n \n 'Magic' in the Pagan religions is generally the channelling and use of 'natural' energy and will power to make changes in the world of varying extents.\n \n And while we're on the subject of definitions, Wicca itself isn't (as the thread title appears to assume) a form of witchcraft as such. Wicca is a Pagan religion, whos followers usually, but not always, use witchcraft.",
