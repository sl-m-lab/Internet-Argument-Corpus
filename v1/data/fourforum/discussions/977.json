   "France has stood in the way of the US's war against Iraq and the US's attempt to reorganize Iraq after the war and it has cost American lives as well as Iraqi lives. France has also been trying to form a rift between the US and the UN and they have been succeeding in doing so. They are dividing the world over the Iraqi war even as Germany and Russia are beginning to turn in their opinion about helping the US reorganize Iraq. France seems determined to stand in the way of any country cooperating with the US if they are able to. Had it not been for France's objection to the war in Iraq there might never have been a war as Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was pinning all his hopes on France to protect him from the US. Had it not been for France's objection to helping the US reorganize Iraq the UN may have already been in Iraq helping our efforts as it would seem the two other leading voices of opposition have been coming around. France is not America's ally at this time and is a threat to political peace between the US and other countries and their opposition has already cost American lives.\n \n A statistic I've heard is that the French economy has lost $500 Million since the beginning of the year due to lost revenues from products commonly sold in the US. That is only .03% of their GDP but with the economy hurting in most parts of the world I'm sure the loss will have it's impact.\n \n I have no doubt many of you have already noticed this and have heard people talk about a French boycott. It has been sometime since I last heard about this until I turned on the radio today and heard some conversation about it. I thought I would bring it up again here to get opinions on whether this boycott should continue, it should end, or it was never started.",

I think it is the fault of the UN that the US had to pass this resolution in the first place. Had the UN simply followed the rules in place from the end of the last war then they would have been in there fighting Iraq without this resolution.

North Korea is the bigger threat, they have WMDs, and they are spitting in the face of the US and UN at every corner. I would have taken a much harder stance on North Korea early on just as the US did with Iraq. We should have cut off aide right away and begun to put our forces in place for a strike. If the UN wouldn't back us on this blatant disregard for the Nonproliferation Treaty that they were in at the time that they claim they began their nuclear program, then screw them. But I would have expected China to get involved simply to prevent a war from taking place so near them and of course the easiest way to do that would have been to side with the US. North Korea probably would have backed down had we done something early on and I think if we really got tough with them right now they would still back down. But that is just my opinion and I can say that this failure to take care of North Korea is the second worst thing about Bush just behind him not taking care of the Mexican border.",

   "We didn't encourage Iraq to invade Kuwait. The \"sources\" you've provided on that claim are no where near credible. And compare the civillian death counts in WW II or Vietnam to those in Iraq. Very, very low deaths. The WMD that the US provided Iraq was insignificant. What was? Those German bioreactors and Russian-trained scientists.\n \n I agree, we shouldn't have let the people down last time. That was what the world wanted, and we listened to the world. Stupid idea? Very. Lesson learned, ignore what the world thinks and do what you know to be right. \n \n You know what? Blame the UN for lack of medicine, food. The UN Oil for Food Program bought Iraq a soccer stadium, cartoon animation equipment, sports cars, oak paneling, etc, etc. Food and medicine? I think not. We know some, not all. The UN doesn't make those books public. I wonder why. You're chasing the wrong people on that one.\n \n The UN disagreed? Resolution? What? There is none? Then how did the UN disagree? \n \n Let me sort this out. UN inspectors get 8 years, and the US gets three months. Come on. What did the UN find in those 8 years? Nothing. Was it obvious there was something to hide? Well, when you have people walking out the back door with documents, large trucks driving away when UN convoys approach, Iraqis telling you that there will be no inspection today, and Iraqis detaining the UN inspectors in a parking lot because they have found some documents... you tell me if they had something to hide. No one said we'd have the WMD in a week after the war. Another issue... why did the Iraqi soldiers have all that WMD gear? I don't think it's because they thought the suits looked cool.\n \n This just in: we haven't formed a new government. If you're referring to the governing council, that's a very diverse body where everyone is represented. It only has so many seats. How would a US appointed council be democracy anyway? :-\\ Democracy doesn't begin for a year or so.\n \n Who's blaming France? I want you to answer me this time, last time you ignored it. Who's blaming France for what? I'm not blaming France for anything--haven't seen anyone else blame them. I support the French boycott because France undermined the US position and sent people with checkbooks to Africa to buy UNSC votes. Is that how an ally behaves? Opposition is fine. There are no German, Russian, Chinese boycotts. Why? They didn't do what France did. They said, \"we disagree, we won't help out.\" \n \n The French Foriegn Minister promised Colin Powell that they would not veto a US resolution on Iraq and wouldn't interefere. Then that changed. France said that they'd veto NO MATTER WHAT, and that they'd do everything in their power to stop US action in Iraq. It's not blame or hate, it's about forgotten promises and alliances. That's why only 20% of Americans consider France a US ally.\n \n The true winners are the Iraqi people. Are US companies going to get the contracts? Of course--who else did anything to deserve contracts? I will fully support giving contracts to nations who help out, including France. The Iraqis now get to see the food and medicine from the UN. The Iraqis can now enjoy freedom and soon enough success. We're spening money that looks to be made a grant. It's not so we can take the oil, that's absurd and will be proven wrong soon enough. It's to further secure our freedom and our safety and inspire freedom and hope in the Middle East. Iraq will become the jewel of the region within 10 years, if we and the international community make sure we do it right.",

   "So, Reagan was concerned about Islamic extremism so he sold weapons to Islamic extremists... Iran. That is what is generally defined by hypocricy.\n \n But you kid yourself. The US only now claims to be worried about the extremists. That is why you guys also armed and trained the Taliban and Al-Queda!\n \n You bombed the Serbs for attacking Kossovo - the KLA were a muslim terrorist group.\n \n War is good for business!\n \n It is about the 'business' of war that is the priority of the US government - Lockheed for instance is one of you biggest companies.\n\n \n About time someone told the truth, America will trade weapons with, and bomb whoever they feel like when it suits them. The library of Congress documents all the trades that went on between the U.S. and Saddam, and it's not just a tiny amount. Over 100,000 Iranians were killed by biochem weapons sold and supported by the U.S. government, that's a few more than were killed in 9/11...\n \n And by boycotting French multinationals, you just lose Americans jobs who work for those firms, the same way that imposing steel tariffs (free trade indeed..) to protect the industry, has led to 20,000 job losses in car manufacturing because they can't afford overpriced American steel.\n \n emoticon_xkill Read The Truth",

   "Winner - Iraqi people, Middle East peace/stability/democracy\n\n \n Yes, I'm sure that in between rebuilding the crumbled ruins that were their homes, mourning their dead children/families, and avoiding US military still running about they're feeling like real winners!\n \n Have you ever spoken to an Iraqi? I can tell you in all honesty that none of my friends from the \"middle east\" feel like a military invasion is either peaceful, stable or democratic. Well, perhaps stable because Iraqis have been living with this since 1990.\n \n Saddam Hussein might very well be a lunatic, but I think dealing with a horrible dictator is still less difficult than dealing with a horrible dictator and a violent military invasion. I'd like to see you tell the thousands of children still dying in hospitals all over Iraq, and their parents, all about how they're winners and this was all for their own good. For democracy and all...although you didn't bother to respect the \"democratic\" opinions of other world leaders, nor the \"democracy\" of Iraqi resistance to Hussein and his party, so why should anybody believe you?\n \n Anyway, this whole thing is ludicrous. I'd like to see the US get rid of their WMDs- oh, wait, they refuse to sign any international disarmament agreements... hmmm.....",
