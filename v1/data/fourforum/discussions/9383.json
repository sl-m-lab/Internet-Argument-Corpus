I would focus largely on that.\n\n \n Actually, he can't because odds are either his opponent will paint it as a personal attack or a strawman (a case could be made for either) and he would loose points for using a logical fallacy, and his opponent would gain points for exposing one.\n \n It may play well to the audience initially, but it will not play well to the judges, and it is the judges that matter. \n \n In my experience, arguing the pro-choice side of the debate is pretty difficult. You are pretty much screwed on the legal side because the constitutional argument is deeply flawed. In reality, there is no precedent for Roe vs Wade, and abortion should fall firmly under the blanket of states rights. It was a politically driven ruling, and frankly you have to either be an idiot who has never read the constitution, or blinded by your prejudice to buy it. \n \n I am pro choice, and even I recognize that Roe vs Wade was a terrible decision. It is a states rights issue, and it is simply not possible to formulate a defendable, logical debate in a formal environment that will work to prove otherwise. I have seen some of the best deabters in the country try to do it, and none has ever managed to formulate a winning strategy there. The problem is that you are essentialyl restriced to the confines of the constitution, and the logic of Roe Vs Wade, and there is just no way to win that one.\n \n Stay the hell away from anything resembling a theological or moral debate. Both are too dicey to trust.\n \n Biological is your best bet. Where you can get into trouble with biological is if the rules you guys operate under allow for props. I have seen several debates of this type that went very well, until the pro life side pulled out a picture of a fetus with little arms and legs and a face. The really devestating ones are the ones where they are sucking their thumb. Those come out, and you loose the crowd. \n \n things to avoid like the plague:\n \n The \"parasite\" argument...basically the argument that Abortion is OK because the fetus is wholloy dependant on the mother for survival. This inevitably bring about the \"toddler\" rebuttal where your opponent points out that a 2 yr old is wholly dependant on its parents for survival, and it is unacceptable to chop up your 2 yr old and throw them in the trash. There is abviosuly as difference there, but it is one that is difficult to prove in a logical debate and in trying to do so, you run the risk of falling into the \"geographic location\" trap. You argue that it is different because the baby is actually IN the mother, and the opponent comes back with the following (or variations of the following):\n \n If I have a sex with a woman, does my penis become hers to do with as she desires while engaged in that activity? If she wished to do so, could she amputate it and argue that it was inside her?\" Think about it for a second...it is surprisingly difficult to counter. If you argue for removal the penis, they will argu for the birth of the baby (i.e removal).\n \n The other potential counter you will see is the actual geographic location counter. They will say \"It appears that, according to my opponent, the \"right\" to kill the baby in question is based soley on the geographic location of said baby.\" Depending on cues form the judges as to how this is being percieved and whether or not a little levity is allowable they may finish with something along the lines of \"If these are the standards we are going to use, I think it is apporpriate to post a list of locations where murder/death is allowable so we can all avoid visiting them\".\n \n Again, this is difficult to counter since if you try, you end up going down a long and convoluted road that you don't want to be on.\n \n Your best bet in a formal abortion debate is to try to get your opponent to cede some ground to you right off, then exploit that to make them look like a hypocrite who is trying to use a double standard. The best way to do this is to play the \"rape and incest\" card right in your opening.\n \n Now, even a tiny bit of research will net the fact that rape and incest victims account for a VERY tiny percentage of abortion recipients, but that does not matter for the purpose of winning the debate. There are 2 things that matter there:\n \n 1. How the resolution is worded. If the resolution is somethign along the lines of \"resolved: abortion should be outlawed\" and you get them to concede that abortions in the case of rape and incest are OK, then you have won. Get up at the next round and point out that your opponent has just conceded that incest should NOT be outlawed, but rather that it should be restricted, which, if your jusdges are honest, should essentially end the debate. \n 2. That most people will concede that abortion in the event of rape and incest is acceptable.\n \n The beauty of #2, if you can't get them on #1, is that just like it is impossible for you to win the \"parasite\" argument, it becomes likewise impossible for them to take any point on the moral, theological, or even LEGAL side once they have conceded that rape and incest victims should be allowed abortions. At that point, every time they step into ANY of those areas, you simply point out that their position is dependant on arbitrary moral judgments relating to the way the fetus was concieved. \n \n This is one they cannot win because from a logical standpoint, how the fetus came to be does not matter. What matters is the disposition of the fetus once it is there. How the fetus came to be is completely irrelevant to the debate unless you have an extremely wordy resolution. \n \n Get somebody to do a formal debate with you here, nocturnal. It will help you kind of bolster your argument and see what traps you don't want to fall into.",

In that case, if you concede that roe v wade was a poor, politically motivated, nonsensical decision that should never have been made and that, in fact, there is no circumstance where the federal government should be involved in abortion at all since it is clearly outside the federal powers as laid forth in the constituion and there is no logical way to connect it to the bill of rights. Immediatly turn around and say \"But just as our constitution fails to convey the power to the federal government to grant abortions, it fails to convey the power to PROHIBIT abortions as well.

   "Would it not be easy to argue that some geographic locations are outside the bounds of a national document?\n\n \n In an informal debate, yes. In a formal debate, where you have to prove your assertations and back them with logic, it becomes dicey at best. \n \n \n \nThis would seem to fail unless he argued entirely against Incorporation of the Bill of Rights against the states.\n\n \n In order to beat it in that manner, you would first have to show that the bill of rights somehow includes the right to an abortion. In Roe, the court ruled that we have an inhernet right to privacy, and that abortions was essentially an exercie of that right...essentially they protected the privacy between a woman and her doctor. They essentially said \"her choice to have an aboriton is a private matter\". The problem with this is that it is wholly illogical. It requires from the outset that there is an option to have an abortion in the first place, and if abortion was illegal, there would be no such option. they essentially made a ruling on the legality of abortion based on the assumption that abortion was legal. It is a logical fallacy.\n \n The second problem with the ruling is that there are several contradictory rulings from the supreme court. They have uphled the power of the FDA to regulate drugs and medical procedures as well as upheld the power of the government to limit what drugs can be prescribed.\n \n If you try to argue that the issue of abortion is a matter of privacy between a patient and their doctor, your opponent will invariably bring up the fact that every single drug and medical procedure used today is directly controlled by the government, up to and including the licensing of said doctor at the state level. It is virtually impossible to overcome this because there is no logical argument as to why the government has the ability to regulate and conrol every single operational aspect of your relationship with your doctor, but they can't touch abortion. The very idea is ludicrous. \n \n A slightly weaker counter to this that is sometimes used (though not as effectively) is the \"anarchist doctors office\" attack. In this, the opponent essentially argues that under the logic of roe v wade, ANYTHING that takes place in your doctors office is private and therefore constitutionally protected. \n \n That particular argument is generally easily beat, but you have to plan for the first defense simply because the abortion debate has been done in debating circles so many times that the various offensive and defensive techniques are out there in the open.\n \n Like I said, I personally am pro choice. I do not like having the pro choice side in a logical debate. The problem is that, as a whole, the abortion debate is more an emotionally charged issue than a logical one. The public likes emotionally charged issues, but they are a bitch to debate logically and all too often you end up debating the logic of the emotional side, and it just turns into a mess. I have debated both sides of this one, and neither side is easy, and on both sides the debate is always pretty weak. I would rather argue the pro side of \"humans were brought to earth by space aliens\" than EITHER side of the abortion debate in a tournament.\n \n The only real advantage that the pro life side has is on the legal, since roe v wade is easily shot down. This does NOT win the debate for them, though, since all it really shows is that the court ruled illogically and improperly. From there, the only real conclusion that can be drawn is that it is a states rights issue. When you get to that point, you still have to come up with a logical argument that the states should outlaw it and you are back to arguing the logic of emotional stances. \n \n The strong side for the pro choice side is always the biological, and that is not much easier to argue than the legal side. In order to effectively leverage the biological argument, you have to define and defend when a person becomes a person. Scholars and philosophers have been working on this question for thousands of years. I am not holding my breath waiting for an answer. What it boils down to is that you have to pick an arbitrary point and then figure out the best ways to defend it. Typically I have seen the most sucess with the pro choice side choosing the onset of brain function since most people recognize that a person with no brain function is not a person. \n \n The one thing I think you want to stay COMPLETELY away from is in trying to claim that a person becomes a person when they are born and not one second before. There is no way you are going to be able to convince any thinking person that a baby is a person the second it is born, but it was not 30 seconds before. The supreme court use viability as a criteria, but if you try to do the same, you will get the \"toddler\" rebuttal every time.",

I would contest this. Quoting from Roe vs. Wade itself:\n http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=410&invol=113 (see section VIII)\n \nThis right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation. \n\n It seems clear that the right to privacy which Roe vs Wade presents is mainly a right of personal liberty. The right to privacy between doctor and patient is another privacy right, but not the main one addressed in this \"Right to Privacy\" claim of Roe vs. Wade. Since it is, in the view of the court in Roe vs. Wade, an issue of inherent personal freedom (not specifically only an issue of privacy of medical records, etc.), there is no logical inconsitency.",
