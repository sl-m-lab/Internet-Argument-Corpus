   "I was watching the Bill Maher show today and they had Jane Fonda on. She mentioned that she has recently become a Christian and that HER god is one that supports a womens right to choice. Now there are so many problems with this that I don't even know where to start. Not only that, I am saying this as almost a \"newbie\" Christian as in I don't know everything there is to know about the Bible. However, I do know that the Christian God that is defined in the Bible is against abortion. Many argue that the Bible is not what the Christian God is because it has been translated into a meaningless document. How is this true when we have so many of the original scrolls? Moreever, how can one claim what God thinks if they don't have anything to base it on? For example if you say the Bible is worthless, you are a Christian, and God believes abortion is ok...then how did you come to this conclusion? The Christian God talks about how one is created before they were put in the womb. God also talks about not killing. So if you wish to be Christian and for abortion you need to rethink one of those stances. God doesn't conform to anyone.",

   "lol Linus...You provide no proof for this.\n \n However the Bible does say \"I create you before I placed you in the womb\"...this would imply that God created you before you are even conceived. Now He also talked about how you can't kill an innocent person. Maybe you should read up a little bit about what the Bible says on abortion. Christians are supposed to believe in the Bible as it is the Word of God. You are supposed to be able to figure out anything that you have question on in the Bible (such as abortion, slavery, homosexuals etc..). \n \n \nThe Bible tells us God is involved in our creation from the womb:\n \n \"Did not He who made me in the womb make him, And the same one fashion us in the womb? (Job 31:15)\n \n Yet Thou art He who didst bring me forth from the womb; Thou didst make me trust when upon my mother's breasts. Upon Thee I was cast from birth; Thou hast been my God from my mother's womb. (Psalms 22:9-10)\n \n For Thou didst form my inward parts; Thou didst weave me in my mother's womb. I will give thanks to Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Thy works, And my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from Thee, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth. Thine eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Thy book they were all written, The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them. (Psalms 139:13-16)\n \n Thus says the LORD who made you And formed you from the womb, who will help you, `Do not fear, O Jacob My servant; And you Jeshurun whom I have chosen. (Isaiah 44:2)\n \n Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, and the one who formed you from the womb, \"I, the LORD, am the maker of all things, Stretching out the heavens by Myself, And spreading out the earth all alone, (Isaiah 44:24)\n\n \n Then Exodus says the following:\n \nIf men fight, and hurt a woman with child, so that she gives birth prematurely, yet no harm follows, he shall surely be punished accordingly as the woman's husband imposes on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. But if any harm follows, then you shall give life for life\n\n \n Not that hard to figure out dude...What is your proof?",

Oh well, I suppose it is all beliefs no matter how silly it sounds. \n \n \n \n \n\"Now He also talked about how you can't kill an innocent person.\"\n\n \n I have read the Bible myself...never found such a verse anywhere. Then again I suppose that depends on your definition of \"innocent\", considering God sponsored the slaughter of non-Jews, disobedient children, people based upon their ethnic origin and etc.. And also person.\n The burden of proof would be for you to prove that God applies this to fetuses. \n \n \n \n \n\"Maybe you should read up a little bit about what the Bible says on abortion.\"\n\n \n It is impossible to read something that can't be found. \n \n \n \n \nThen Exodus says the following:\n Quote: \n Originally Posted by God \n If men fight, and hurt a woman with child, so that she gives birth prematurely, yet no harm follows, he shall surely be punished accordingly as the woman's husband imposes on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. But if any harm follows, then you shall give life for life\n \n\n \n You mean Exodus 21:22-23 and you are using a contemporary translation of it...not tradition. The traditional interpretation of this text, which even rabbinical scholars accepted for thousands of years, is this: if a man hurts a woman enough to cause a miscarriage, he reciprocates according to how much injury he caused her, i.e., an eye for an eye, etc. However, if the miscarriage resulted in no injury to the woman, then all the assailant had to pay was a monetary fine. The fact that the Bible does not equate the assailant's life with the stillborn's life is proof that the Bible does not count the fetus as a person. Further more we should have found replications of your contemporary translation since the copying of laws in the Middle East was widespread. Instead, the Assyrians, Hittites, Sumerians, Babylonians, Hammurapi and Eshnunna all have similar laws that go according to the traditional interpretation of it. \n Lastly, if a woman gave birth \"prematurely\" back in Biblical ages it would have resulted in the birth of a stillborn. Saving premature babies is an achievement of modern science. Not God. \n \n \n \n \n\"Not that hard to figure out dude...What is your proof?\"\n\n \n If it isn't so hard then why haven't you found it yet?

Now what does it say about abortion? Well it says you can't kill a person. God defines person as before being concieved even!!!! The person that argrees differently has not read the Bible nor taken the time to understand it. You have disproved nothing.\" \n\n \n The Bible says you can't kill a person? WRONG! The Bible is filled with countless stories of god sanctioned aggressive warmongering, genocide, pillaging, plundering, wanton destruction, sexual slavery, rape, misogyny, child abuse, homophobia, unfair laws, cruel and unusual punishment, the punishment of innocents, and brutal chattel slavery. God defines birth as following the commonly held Jewish belief that people are made from soil and lifted into the bellies of their mothers. Conception is a modern discovery, not biblical. \n Before you attempt to preach about what is in the Bible why don't you read it? Blindly saying stuff that you might think is \"cool\" or \"neat\" in the Bible is no longer cutting it.",

The traditional interpretation of this text, which even rabbinical scholars accepted for thousands of years, is this: if a man hurts a woman enough to cause a miscarriage, he reciprocates according to how much injury he caused her, i.e., an eye for an eye, etc. However, if the miscarriage resulted in no injury to the woman, then all the assailant had to pay was a monetary fine. The fact that the Bible does not equate the assailant's life with the stillborn's life is proof that the Bible does not count the fetus as a person. Further more we should have found replications of your contemporary translation since the copying of laws in the Middle East was widespread. Instead, the Assyrians, Hittites, Sumerians, Babylonians, Hammurapi and Eshnunna all have similar laws that go according to the traditional interpretation of it. \n Lastly, if a woman gave birth \"prematurely\" back in Biblical ages it would have resulted in the birth of a stillborn. Saving premature babies is an achievement of modern science. Not God. \n\n \n After looking up some stuff I found out that miscarriage is not used. Yatsa is the word that is commonly misused to mean miscarriage while here is means to give birth. This is clear because later on the writter refers to a miscarriage using the word shakal. So in conclusion we can determine this quote to mean you can't kill the baby inside the mother.

Thus it is impossible to refute my claim, on Biblical grounds, that God is just in everything He does.\n \n \nMore me to judge your god is to imply just that...I can judge. If you want to search for hidden meanings then be my guest but you are just utilizing the fallacy of attacking the messenger instead of the message.\n\n I have shown that for you to judge God is to in fact claim that you know more than God. The only way you could be right in saying this is if you know more than He does. This thread is arguing on Biblical grounds, that is, what the Bible says; and as such, it is again impossible to refute my claim.",

   "Suppose Jim wants to do the following: take his newborn infant, and with a knife cut off its fingers and toes. Then he decides he wants to cut off its legs and its arms. Being a good Christian though, Jim wants to find out what the Bible has to say about this particular action. He decides that he needs direct evidence that this action is wrong, therefore he will need to find one verse that specifically says this particular action is wrong.\n\n \n Jim needs to look in the Bible whether or not God would forbid it? Geez! So much for Christian morality. The kid must be lacking common sense, needs to be locked up and be given a new set of parents who can actually teach him morals. Secondly, the Bible is silent on the issue of that as far as I know but what multiple verses will he use? \n Someone can mix up five verses that regards Jim as having the right to even kill his brother. People have used the Bible to support all kinds of cruelties throughout the ages; slavery, anti-Semitism, the torture and murder of women as witches, sexual repression, censorship and the Inquisition, Crusades and other aggressive wars, and capital punishment for misdemeanors. \n None of these were directly supported by the Bible, just like abortion, but they were implied as such.",

   "\n So you admit that a Christian can't support abortion. As God determines a person to be a person long before they are even in the womb. And he talks about not killing innocent people (murder).

As long as you and JP and so many pro-lifers trivialize what women face, and the Hunters of this world feel women are porperty I will be pro-choice.\n \n Until I see real respect for women and a real interest in operating in her best interest (which ultimately will also be the fetus') fom lifers I will remain pro-choice. On this board, Steve is the only lifer who has a willingness to recognize and acknowledge women's issues. He is the only one who does not demonize them or trivialize them. He is a rare gem amongst pro-lifers. I have occasionally encountered others with his views like him, but they have always been women. Conservative men have real troubles respecting women - COMPLETELY respecting them (respect goes beyond not using them as sex objects and not beating them up).

We don't have time to read the last 500,000 posts on that website to see whether or not he is a hypocrite. So either you back up your claim or we will just assume he is not a hypocrite. At the same time we will assume that in the event you try to call someone out again, you will have no credibility because all you have done is smear him without providing proof.

And when He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written: 18 \"The Spirit of the LORD is upon Me, \n Because He has anointed Me To preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives \n And recovery of sight to the blind, To set at liberty those who are oppressed; \n 19 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD. ' 20 Then He closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were fixed on Him. 21 And He began to say to them, \"Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.\"\n \n Jesus claimed He had fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah 61, thereby confirming the testimony of Isaiah as God's word. If Jesus lied, He was not God.\n \n \nGod certainly did enough killing or innocents, so he is a hypocrite even if he was just. The commandment says you shouldn't kill. The world's corrupt, let's just kill everyone besides one family, the rest are pure evil and don't deserve to live. Meanwhile today there are serial killers and rapists that are still alive and free. Why doesn't he kill them?\n\n God can kill anyone He wants because 1) The commandment says you shall not murder. 2) if God takes life justly, it follows that He did not murder.",

Essentially, you have done the following: VOR supports the murder of abortion doctors and pedophiliacs. To prove this, we'll give a post where he supports calling people names.

If Jesus lied, He was not God.\n \n\n Or maybe people wrote it to try to support belief in God.\n \n\n God can kill anyone He wants because 1) The commandment says you shall not murder. 2) if God takes life justly, it follows that He did not murder.\n\n I never claimed that he did, I am saying that many people murder such as serial killers yet he doesn't punish them, he punished EVERYONE with the flood. Was EVERYONE worse than these serial killers? I don't think so.\n \n This quote is one of the reason I don't agree with Christianity. When you have a ruler that by definition is always just I don't like it. Too much authority. He could say that you have to eat your children and it would be considered just.\n \n \n \n \n Also someone earlier brought up finding anything you want to in the bible. Someone mentioned that the bible promoted homosexuality because it says \"love thy neighbor\" and maybe I want to go love my neighbor. They've used it to justify wars against innocent people (they weren't Christian, that was their only \"crime\"), they've used it to execute \"witches\" and other stuff like that. Politicians use it to justify wars all the time (in fact Bush said that \"God told me to strike Al Quadea and I did, then he told me to strike Iraq, and I did\"). You can twist and bend verses of the bible any way you want which is the problem. While you say that it states that fetuses are babies and murder is a sin but many also use the bible to claim that women should be inferior to men. They use it to justify their actions every which way and that's why the bible being so vague is a bad idea. If only they had written the word abortion or had an appendix at the end defining murder we'd know but unless there is a direct mention about abortion all you can take is an educated guess. People already admit that we can't comprehend God, how can we comprehend what he meant with 2 separate verses? Maybe he used different logic than us.

   "Or you believe that God/Jesus didn't write the bible but man did.\n\n This is a common belief, though I disagree with it. And since this thread is about what the Bible says, it really isn't necessary to settle this question.\n \n \nI never claimed that he did, I am saying that many people murder such as serial killers yet he doesn't punish them, he punished EVERYONE with the flood. Was EVERYONE worse than these serial killers? I don't think so.\n\n \"Will the fault finder contend with the Almighty?\" Read Job. 38-41.\n \n \nThis quote is one of the reason I don't agree with Christianity. When you have a ruler that by definition is always just I don't like it. Too much authority. He could say that you have to eat your children and it would be considered just.\n\n First of all, the thread is about what the Bible says, so my quote is not refutable on biblical grounds. Secondly, you don't believe the Bible is God's word because you don't like what it says?\n \n \nAlso someone earlier brought up finding anything you want to in the bible. Someone mentioned that the bible promoted homosexuality because it says \"love thy neighbor\" and maybe I want to go love my neighbor. They've used it to justify wars against innocent people (they weren't Christian, that was their only \"crime\"), they've used it to execute \"witches\" and other stuff like that. Politicians use it to justify wars all the time (in fact Bush said that \"God told me to strike Al Quadea and I did, then he told me to strike Iraq, and I did\"). You can twist and bend verses of the bible any way you want which is the problem. While you say that it states that fetuses are babies and murder is a sin but many also use the bible to claim that women should be inferior to men. They use it to justify their actions every which way and that's why the bible being so vague is a bad idea. If only they had written the word abortion or had an appendix at the end defining murder we'd know but unless there is a direct mention about abortion all you can take is an educated guess. People already admit that we can't comprehend God, how can we comprehend what he meant with 2 separate verses? Maybe he used different logic than us. With God you never know, that's why I like to stick with what I do know.\n\n That people have abused the Bible cannot be denied. This does not show that the Bible can't be understood in a sound, consistent way. You again in this quote assume that the Bible is the word of man, not the word of God. I, on the other hand, believe the Bible speaks clearly on every moral issue past, present, and future. How could it do such a thing? \n16 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; 17 so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work. \n",

   "\n \"Rashach : To murder, slay.\n I don't know where you get something differently.\" \n\n \n Because you use contemporary Hebrew...not classic, which is hundreds of years outdated like Old English. The grammar and definition have changed for many words in Hebrew since the reestablishment of Israel. Understandably, the community part would be dropped off so rashach would sound similar to the more accepted definition of murder. \n However splitting hairs isn't going to do you any good either. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"After looking up some stuff I found out that miscarriage is not used. Yatsa is the word that is commonly misused to mean miscarriage while here is means to give birth. This is clear because later on the writter refers to a miscarriage using the word shakal.\" \n\n \n Your site is just using the regular old contemporary translation of Exodus 21 that I pointed out earlier. For thousands of years Rabbis translated it as this; if a woman is injured then it is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life. If the fetus is injured then it is only a small crime that and those responsible must pay a fine according to the father. As such, even such a law was reflective in all other surrounding cultures. \n You don't have to go far into Judaism to see that Jewish culture didn't really cherish fetal life since an embryo is not reckoned a viable living thing (in Hebrew, bar kayama). Even the phrase adopted to \"unborn children\" is ubar yerech imo-- which deems the fetus as being part of the pregnant woman's body.\n If the webmaster to your site wants to play history revisionist because he thinks Exodus 21 should be interpreted differently from the way it has been done traditionally for many centuries then so be it. It doesn't change history or the original interpretation. And yet it still doesn't say anything against abortion. \n Try again. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"So in conclusion we can determine this quote to mean you can't kill the baby inside the mother. For a further explanation of this I have found a link that kinda says this\" \n\n \n No, even if the Jews had translated it as such it would not condemn abortion. By your interpretation a man is being punished for wrongfully killing a fetus. This doesn't bar the parents from attaining an abortion. \n Once again you are using a logic fallacy. If situation Z provides punishment Y then situation X would provide punishment Y too. Your logic doesn't make any sense. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"Liberals are losing a lot these days.\"\n\n \n Indeed...we have already lost 3,000 on 9/11 because of Bush incompetence and 1,500 soldiers because of his war on demand in Iraq. However it is not a loss that is exclusive to just us. I would like to think it applies to many Americans. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"Every one of them?\"\n\n \n Everyone of them that I have read (and I have read a lot). From the most conservative (Falwell) to the most liberal (Kangas), the bible is silent on the issue. If there was a direct verse against abortion then we wouldn't be arguing about this but since there isn't, both sides dig in the Bible looking for verses that might support their political agendas. \n I find it to be rather pathetic. If you need to pervert ancient scripture for the sake of their political ideology then it certainly shows a lack of conviction on their part. \n \n \n \n \n\n The constitution says nothing about abortion either. How are they implied rights? \n\n \n The constitution provides many rights that are implied. An officer reading you your rights before being arrested is an implied right. Using birth control is an implied right. Owning a firearm is an implied right from the second \n \n \n \n \n\n \"Maybe the Bible implies that you can't do abortion?\" \n\n \n Maybe the Bible implies people can have abortions? It doesn't matter...if something needs to be implied by multiple passages then it isn't direct. Which once again proves my point. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"In case you forgot you said \"abortion is not mentioned in the Bible therefore it is ok\"...\"\n\n \n Not a case of me forgetting but a case of me never suggesting anything of that nature on this thread. I have searched all over this thread for that phrase and used the forum search engine; nothing. My position doesn't need the Bible to prove a point. I find the Bible to be absolved of all moral teachings. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \"...so I asked if you believed banning abortion is unconsitutional...you never really answered but if you said YES then you would be inconsistent in your views because the constitution never mentinos the word abortion at all...if you can't imply abortion in the Bible how can you in the constitution?\"\n\n \n You are confused. \n I am not the one pigeonholing the entire argument for supporting/condemning in Christianity by only using the Bible. I demanded for a direct passage against abortion and now even you admit this is impossible because it involves implying it from multiple sources. \n As for your question it is irrelevant but if you desperately need it answered to ease your mind it matters nothing to me if abortion is constitutional or not...it matters more if it is moral. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"I still don't see your point about Christians supporting abortion for hundreds of years...THey supported slavery too and this was against the Bible.\"\n\n \n For many reasons. \n If you are writing off every person from being a Christian because they do not support your position then you need to condemn the majority of Christians as being false. This would mean Christianity is a minority at best and a dead religion at worst. \n Secondly, you appear to be totally ignorant of Christian history. If the Bible had a direct passage on abortion, as you admit, then the religion would have never practiced abortion for centuries. This isn't proof that abortion is right according to the Bible, but proof that it doesn't have sound message on the issue. \n Lastly, chattel slavery was supported in the Bible...the worst form of slavery; people being treated as property. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"I go by the Bible and it says you can't murder a person and also says a fetus is a person.\"\n\n \n The two do not connect. Murder is a relative term applied to illegal killing (remember, abortion is legal). The Old Testament does not view the fetus as a viable life form. The Bible treats \"unborn babies\" as extensions of the woman. If a pregnant woman was guilty of prostitution they were to be incinerated...not spared (Genesis 38). The Bible shows God didn't spare fetal life from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra and the drowning of the entire human race during Noah's Flood. God never prohibited the slaughter of pregnant women of the Mideanites, Amalekites and countless other tribes. Like always the fetus was viewed as a part of the woman. Her sin was tied to the fetus. \n There are even countries that legally treat fetuses as people and abortion is perfectly legal. \n You are forging a link and it is a link that doesn't prove anything. Seriously, where is this direct passage at? \n \n \n \n \n\n \"Not only that, in Exodus it says if you kill the unborn you pay the price as if you murdered. So silent on abortion? No. Have you proven the Bible is silent? Not even close. Keep working at it.\" \n\n \n Exodus doesn't say anything about abortion. Instead Exodus 21mentions how a man must pay if he accidentally injures the husband's pregnant wife. It doesn't say anything about killing a fetus intentionally nor does it say a woman cannot have an abortion. Instead it sets a punishment that is exclusive to this situation and not any others. Also husbands were allowed to destroy the fetuses of their wives if she became pregnant due to adultery (Numbers 5). Families were given the right to kill their children if they became rude (Exodus 21). \n If you were an archeologist studying American laws hundreds of years from the future, you'd probably claim we always banned abortion because our legal system punish people for accidentally damaging a fetus...even though abortion was perfectly legal since the beginning of our history.\n Once again, you are going back to forging links.

   "Because you use contemporary Hebrew...not classic, which is hundreds of years outdated like Old English. The grammar and definition have changed for many words in Hebrew since the reestablishment of Israel. Understandably, the community part would be dropped off so rashach would sound similar to the more accepted definition of murder. \n However splitting hairs isn't going to do you any good either.\n\n Because you say so right? Everywhere I looked it said that word (which you even spelt wrong making it harder to look up) means murder and not kill...this was because they had another word for kill. Would you like to post a credible site that states otherwise?\n \n \nYour site is just using the regular old contemporary translation of Exodus 21 that I pointed out earlier. For thousands of years Rabbis translated it as this; if a woman is injured then it is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life. If the fetus is injured then it is only a small crime that and those responsible must pay a fine according to the father. As such, even such a law was reflective in all other surrounding cultures. \n You don't have to go far into Judaism to see that Jewish culture didn't really cherish fetal life since an embryo is not reckoned a viable living thing (in Hebrew, bar kayama). Even the phrase adopted to \"unborn children\" is ubar yerech imo-- which deems the fetus as being part of the pregnant woman's body.\n If the webmaster to your site wants to play history revisionist because he thinks Exodus 21 should be interpreted differently from the way it has been done traditionally for many centuries then so be it. It doesn't change history or the original interpretation. And yet it still doesn't say anything against abortion. \n Try again. \n\n \n I actually got it from a number of sites. It doesn't matter how rabbis translated it for many years as it still shows that the Exodus 21 phrase doesn't translate into miscarriage as you claimed earlier. Not only this...it can only have one meaning which doesn't change and since you have provided no evidence to contradict what I said it is just what you think.\n \n \nNo, even if the Jews had translated it as such it would not condemn abortion. By your interpretation a man is being punished for wrongfully killing a fetus. This doesn't bar the parents from attaining an abortion. \n Once again you are using a logic fallacy. If situation Z provides punishment Y then situation X would provide punishment Y too. Your logic doesn't make any sense. \n \n\n If we translated as I had stated then ther person that killedthe fetus would be punished as killing a person (eye for an eye) as they said and would be punished by death. So logically since the fetus is considered a person and abortion kills a person....Do I need to spell it out? logic fallacy...I think not.\n \"try again\" as you always say.\n \n \nIndeed...we have already lost 3,000 on 9/11 because of Bush incompetence and 1,500 soldiers because of his war on demand in Iraq. However it is not a loss that is exclusive to just us. I would like to think it applies to many Americans. \n\n and 600,000 under Lincoln...way to take the statement and try to prove a different point.\n \n \nEveryone of them that I have read (and I have read a lot). From the most conservative (Falwell) to the most liberal (Kangas), the bible is silent on the issue. If there was a direct verse against abortion then we wouldn't be arguing about this but since there isn't, both sides dig in the Bible looking for verses that might support their political agendas. \n I find it to be rather pathetic. If you need to pervert ancient scripture for the sake of their political ideology then it certainly shows a lack of conviction on their part. \n\n \n You know..the Bible doesn't directly talk about a lot of things, however, we can easily figure out what it is talking about. This is because the Bible is written to provide answers to morality of today, yesteday, and future (I believe Cone posted a quote from the Bible showing this in this thread). And if you think Falwell is silent on the issue of abortion...think again.\n \n And you continue on for pages....\n However proving nothing and even going as far as to suggest that I am desperate and not very insightful. Maybe you didn't mean this and I will give you the benefit of the doubt, however, you make a lot of claims which seem ok however you provide no evidence for these. You claim that NO theolgian has my views (eventhough I believe I posted one) and yet you provided nothing to prove your point other then a crazy website about religious tolerance. Shall I submit a website about how we are all robots as evidence that this is true? I am just suggesting that you provide some evidence to back your claims of hebrew words..etc...in order for me to actually take your claims seriously. WHo knows, you may actually be correct on some things...however you just saying it will not convince me when I find things contrary to what you say....Just a suggestion :)",

   "Since when was knowing more then the other guy a prerequisite to judgment?\n God commits murder, therefore I condemn the murderer. Understood? I am not interested in the excuses of a murderer. Murder is murder.\n\n The only way you can accuse God of murder is if you know that he killed someone unjustly. If you know this, you know more than God, because God, who is omniscient and just, obviously feels He has done no such thing.\n \n \nAnother logic fallacy. Are we catching red herrings in order to compensate for a lack of substance to the topic? Do you have an axe to grind with me? I must warn you that people who hold grudges discard logic and dignity to fulfill their emotionally charged impulses. Having an axe grinding and army of logic fallacies will serve you no good against me.\n\n Good grief, Charlie Brown. Let me take you through the whole process so we can see if I have done any such thing...\n \n Here was an initial claim:\n \nLinus, when it comes to abortion have you ever considered you might be wrong?\n \n What is the harm in denying a woman and abortion because she has a headache or had a bad night?\n\n To which you responded:\n \nI don't understand your question. Why is it only applying to women with just headaches and bad nights? Last time I checked abortion was legal for all women.\n\n To which Voice of Reason responded:\n \nBecause a lot of women get abortions for convenience......\n \n To which you said:\n \nBecause pregnancy is just a minor inconvenience for all women, right? A big blow over that doesn't mean anything.\n \n To which chloe responded:\n \nI think that maybe the point is that because of the way the courts have defined \"the woman's health\" that an abortion can be performed for any reason at all and for no reason at all.\n\n And here's the biggy, this is what you said:\n \nI don't think it is the point at all...I think it is just his shot at defacing the seriousness of having an unwanted pregnany.\n\n \n Obviously you are unwilling to give anyone the benefit of the doubt. You automatically assume that someone defaces the seriousness of an unwanted pregnancy with no evidence, save that he didn't believe convienece abortions should be legal. Thus, I took your statement and held it to your own standards, i.e., I did not give you the benefit of the doubt. Thus I said:\n \nI guess by this statement you are defacing and trivializing the seriousness of a wanted pregnancy, seeing how you only think pregnancy is serious if it is unwanted.\n\n See what happens when people don't give you the benefit of the doubt, and instead try and imply what you mean? I love how people on this board hold others to a higher standard than they hold themselves.\n \n As for this claim,\n \n \nI must warn you that people who hold grudges discard logic and dignity to fulfill their emotionally charged impulses.\n \n \n \nBecause pregnancy is just a minor inconvenience for all women, right? A big blow over that doesn't mean anything. Keep thinking that way. The less you understand about those having an abortion the more it helps us. We are here to help, we are here to take a woman's crisis seriously and not deface it as being a matter of \"inconvenience.\"\n\n His statment did not imply in the least bit that he did not think pregnancy is serious. You read it that way because you wanted to. Is this a case where you have a grudge, thereby you dicard logic and dignity to fulfill your emotionally charged impulses?",

   "\n This quote is one of the reason I don't agree with Christianity. When you have a ruler that by definition is always just I don't like it. Too much authority. He could say that you have to eat your children and it would be considered just.\n\n While the Bible claims God is just and true in all his ways (and backs it up with evidence), it also makes multitudes of claims about other aspects of his nature (and then backs it up with evidence). \n Psalms 145\n 8 The LORD is gracious and merciful; Slow to anger and great in lovingkindness. 9 The LORD is good to all, And His mercies are over all His works.\n \n Ex 33 \n 18 Then Moses said, \"I pray You, show me Your glory!\" 19 And He said, \" I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion.\"\n And then...\n Ex 34 \n 34:6-7 \n Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, \"The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness and truth; \n who keeps lovingkindness for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression and sin; yet He will by no means leave {the guilty} unpunished, visiting the iniquity of fathers on the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations.\" \n \n None of these attributes ever conflict with justice. \n \n \nYou can twist and bend verses of the bible any way you want which is the problem. ....that's why the bible being so vague is a bad idea. \n\n The Bible makes the claim of clarity. But you have assumed that just because anyone can twist and bend it, take it out of context, do whatever to make it say what they want, then it is not clear (which happens to be a wrong assumption). It is true that anyone could distort and misrepresent any clearly written document in the same way that they can take the letters of the alphabet and make it say whatever they want. This is why it is imoportant to read the document in question in context before buying into any claim made of the document.\n \n \nPeople already admit that we can't comprehend God, how can we comprehend what he meant with 2 separate verses? Maybe he used different logic than us. With God you never know, that's why I like to stick with what I do know. \n\n While God cannot be fully known he can be known and can be rightly known and the Bible can be rightly known and understood. This is according to the Bible's claim.",

   "So you resign then? However I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and believe you were merely confused and have thus retreated from your post and have acknowledged my superiority over you in this thread. \n A very honorable thing you do. \n \n \n \n\n Because you say so right? Everywhere I looked it said that word (which you even spelt wrong making it harder to look up) means murder and not kill...this was because they had another word for kill. Would you like to post a credible site that states otherwise?\n\n \n Like I said. It isn't going to matter whether we use an ancient or contemporary definition of Hebrew. You still can't prove your point either way because murder applies to only illegal killing. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"I actually got it from a number of sites.\"\n\n \n I am sure you have. \n \n \n \n \n\n \" It doesn't matter how rabbis translated it for many years as it still shows that the Exodus 21 phrase doesn't translate into miscarriage as you claimed earlier.\"\n\n \n So? You are too busy arguing over moot detail. Time to do a little research on ancient abortion history, shall we? Hebrew laws were often copied by surrounding cultures and vice versa. \n \n \"The earliest laws that provided punishment for killing fetuses seemed to have been made in the interest of the fathers and not the fetuses themselves. The Code of Hammurabi, which was thought to have been written in the Eighteenth Century B.C.E., required that silver be paid to the father of a pregnant woman who was caused to miscarry by another person (Platt). The Hebrew Torah or Old Testament likewise requires simply a payment to the \"master\" of the woman who was caused to miscarry (Exodus 21:22-25). A Middle Assyrian law that was in force around five centuries after Hammurabi's code provides the most striking example of a law protecting fetuses in the interest of the father. It punished a woman who purposely caused herself to miscarry with impalement and no burial, but fathers had the right to practice infanticide on their unwanted offspring (Lerner; Reiman).\"\n http://www.geocities.com/dnwppg/research-editorial/prologic.html\n \n I see you are wrong once again. I know your rhetoric like the back of my hand and if you want to squabble over petty detail about Hebrew words then have fun. My position is not only solid but Exodus 21 cannot be used to imply abortion is wrong. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"If we translated as I had stated then ther person that killedthe fetus would be punished as killing a person (eye for an eye) as they said and would be punished by death. So logically since the fetus is considered a person and abortion kills a person....Do I need to spell it out? logic fallacy...I think not.\"\n\n \n But it doesn't. It doesn't say a fetus is a person. It doesn't say that the perpetrator has committed such a crime (murder) to begin with. Once again, you are forging links which are not there. Judaism, as I stated over and over again, acknowledges life at first breath. \n The Bible gives permission to destroy fetal life in many occasions. If killing a fetus was murder then you need to find a passage that absolutely condemns killing a fetus. \n The Hebrews could kill the unborn babies of the enemy and a husband could abort a fetus if it was the byproduct of an affair. \n Sorry, the Bible isn't a one way street on the issue of preserving fetal life. \n \"Try again\" as I always say.\n \n \n \n \n\n \"and 600,000 under Lincoln...way to take the statement and try to prove a different point.\"\n\n \n You are the one who made the claim...I am only agreeing with you and explaining my answer. Is that a now crime? \n \n \n \n \n\n \"You know..the Bible doesn't directly talk about a lot of things, however, we can easily figure out what it is talking about. This is because the Bible is written to provide answers to morality of today, yesteday, and future.\"\n\n \n So you now admit there isn't a direct passage on abortion. How long did it take you to figure that out? \n Anyone can imply that the Bible supports X position. You could even use it to support infanticide, genocide or slavery. It has been done before. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"And if you think Falwell is silent on the issue of abortion...think again.\"\n \n\n \n Never said that I thought this. \n \n \n \n \n\n How did that one work out for them?\n\n \n Wonderfully. As we speak, you guys elected a president who campaigns for pro-choice candidates. \n Hmm GOP \"morality\" doesn't exactly win you elections...it really just frightens people. Remember the Republican convention in 1996? Jerry Falwell or Robertson declaring a \"war\" on the \"godless\"? \n Or how about Bush in 2000 constantly having to address the fear in moderate voters about him possibly outlawing abortion?\n Arlen and Arnold enjoy your support.",

I simply stated my opinion that he doesn't take pregnancy, esp. if unwanted, as serious. VOR has been slandering abortion as a reason done mostly out of convenience. The nature that anyone can whittle down such a situation as merely being an issue of comfort shows not only a lack of insight about how stressful pregnancy is but also apathetic to their plight. If VOR wants to believe women have abortions because they had a bad day or their head hurts and if so I would label him as that; someone who doesn't take unwanted pregnancies serious. \n You know, it really speaks volumes when you make a post that is entirely irrelevant to the topic and to you, but also apparently condone such a statement as VOR's over nailing someone for not giving someone the \"benefit of the doubt.\" If I were still pro-life I would be embarrassed by VOR.",

   "Nope, I just know what murder is. Stop the spinning...you are making yourself dizzy. \n God isn't even omniscient...it is just something it claims and is never proven. If god was all knowing then it would knowingly create people who would go to hell. It would knowingly create people who would be aborted, punished, oppressed and sinned. It would knowingly create people who would rise against him and later be outraged...even thought it knew it would happen. It knew and planned out the holocaust. It knew and planned out 9/11 terrorist attacks. It knew and planned out Stalin's great purges upon the Ukrainians. \n And it would know all of this before the world was ever created. So basically you worship the greatest murder of all times; god. \n Thanks for making that clear.\n\n Look, when arguing from Biblical grounds, which this post is supposed to be doing, it is not possible to say that God is unjust, even in all the situations that you stated.

The majority of Christians in the USA believe abortion is a right or believe it should be allowed in only a few circumstances. So does that mean only a few Christians reside here in America then? Last time I checked only about 5-9% of Americans are absolutely opposed to abortion so I guess 9/10 Christians are false. Apparently George W Bush and over 90% of republicans are not Christian anymore because you said so. \n Keep it up, you are defeating yourself with your own logic. By the time you are done shunning heretics within your own religion on the abortion issue alone, Christianity would be a tiny, irrelevant faith left on the footnotes of modern history. \n A great way to turn people away from Christianity. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"Please, at some point you appeal to authority...\"\n\n \n Aren't you the same guy who claimed I said abortion was okay because the Bible is silent on it and yet never proved I said it? \n \n \n \n \n\n \" However, having a PHd holds more credibility then a geocities website.\"\n\n \n So what if someone with a Phd made a website on geocities...then what? Are they no longer credible? And what makes a geocities website less credible then a regular website? Is it because someone felt like forking over money to pay for web space and the other didn't? Or is it because the creator of the website knew HTML scripting and the other didn't? Please explain. A Phd only means the level of education of someone...it doesn't mean they'll utilize that knowledge. Today, we have people with Phds that claim the world is flat. \n I find such comments like yours amusing. Apparently you don't even bother to think these things through and just post out of impulse. Following your logic, pro-lifers are irrelevant because the Supreme Court is ruled by those who have taken years and years of classes on American law as opposed to a group of angry religious zealots who usually just have a high school education. Based on your conclusion these judges know what they are talking about and you don't. \n See what happens when you base reason on appeal only? \n Most Americans support Roe v Wade. So does that makes abortion right?\n The Supreme Court supports Roe v Wade. So does that makes abortion right?\n The AMA supports Roe v Wade. So does that makes abortion right?\n You guys lose. Time for you to take a class in logic. \n \n \n \n\n \" So I suggest you get a source to prove some of your stuff or this is a worthless debate.\"\n\n \n Already have but the only problem is that you ignore the information provided and attack the messenger instead. If the information on these sites are so wrong and invalid then you wouldn't feel so threatened by them. Either you find the website too \"anti-Christian\" or it is ran by a web service you don't like.\n You need to suggest yourself a source to prove that the Bible directly condemns abortion before you can suggest anything to others. Your topic is centered on explaining how Christians cannot support abortion but yet never have you provided a source to prove this. Only innuendo and post-hoc logic. \n \n \n \n\n \"I have shown what all of those passages mean and how they fit together to show that God doesn't support abortion at all.\"\n\n \n No. You haven't. They don't \"fit together\", you make them fit together in order to create a viewpoint that is totally alien within the Bible. It is called forging a link. Not once have you provided evidence that God condemns abortion. \n \n \n \n\n \"So go ahead and call me an \"ungrateful loser\", I choose facts and sources to show my points.\" \n\n \n No, you only select facts and positions that support your viewpoint and then attempt to discredit or ignore facts that collide against your precious views. Any time I use a source you find an excuse to avoid acknowledging or simply ignore it. This is what makes you an ungrateful loser.

The majority of Christians in the USA believe abortion is a right or believe it should be allowed in only a few circumstances. So does that mean only a few Christians reside here in America then? Last time I checked only about 5-9% of Americans are absolutely opposed to abortion so I guess 9/10 Christians are false. Apparently George W Bush and over 90% of republicans are not Christian anymore because you said so. \n Keep it up, you are defeating yourself with your own logic. By the time you are done shunning heretics within your own religion on the abortion issue alone, Christianity would be a tiny, irrelevant faith left on the footnotes of modern history. \n A great way to turn people away from Christianity.\n\n \n No need for petty insults on me.

I then posted MANY quotes about how God forms one in the womb and how God creates you before you were in the womb. You then responded by claiming hebrew words have been mistranslated...I then refuted those with a source that shows otherwise and you have yet to refute that.\n \n From a recent CBS poll, 24% of people outright don't support any abortion. 38% said stricter limits. LA Times has it at 53% that say few strictions or none at all. The polls go on. Most people support abortion for a few cases such as rape or death of mother and child.

There is a difference in calling Jane Fonda being a Christian a joke and calling me a joke...refrain from direct attacks as it is in the forum rules.\"\n\n \n So there is a difference between calling Jane Fonda a joke for what she believes (God supporting abortion) and calling you a joke for what you believe (God condemns abortion)? Your hypocrisy is astounding and the fact that you don't dismiss this probably means you agree with my assessment. \n The double standards you present are tearing your argument to pieces. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Linus, I think you are the one refusing to look at the facts...How many times do I have to post this stuff. I posted a quote from Exodus which suggests that killing an unborn is murder and deserves \"an eye for an eye\". \n\n \n You posted this ten pages down and I have defeated it again, again and again. It is like beating a dead horse. Lets go over the motions once again.\n I. Your interpretation of Exodus 21 NEVER states killing a fetus is murder. In fact, it wouldn't be murder at all; it is manslaughter. The man who harms the woman did it by accident while murder would require him to premeditatedly attack the woman. However you use commandment 6 in conjunction with Exodus 21 to make your point but commandment 6 only condemns murder...not manslaughter. So commandment 6 + Exodus 21 do not equal abortion is wrong. Try again. \n II. Give Exodus 21 the benefit of the doubt. There are many countries that punish people for harming pregnant women and allow legal abortion. \n III. The Bible doesn't absolutely condemn killing fetuses. In Numbers 5 and Exodus 21, people are given the right to destroy innocent fetal life. Hebrews could slay \"unborn babies\" of the enemy, husbands could make their wives miscarry if his wife became pregnant due to adultery and etc.. \n IV. Biblical laws were often emulated and vice versa to similar neighboring cultures. Their laws interpreted the same way Rabbis have been interpreting Exodus 21 for hundreds of years. The Code of Hammurabi and the Sumerian code fined the man who induced a miscarriage upon the husband's wife (in the Sumerian case, it was based on the woman's social status.) In Assyrian Code, a man charged with the crime only had to do public service. Again and again, accidentally inducing abortion was only a misdemeanor. Not murder nor manslaughter.\n \n \n \n \n \n \"I then posted MANY quotes about how God forms one in the womb and how God creates you before you were in the womb.\"\n\n \n And I posted this as irrelevant and goes to a more thornier question; if god knew us before the moment of conception then why would he supposedly \"ensoul\" a zygote that would have been knowingly aborted? \n \n \n \n \n \n \"You then responded by claiming hebrew words have been mistranslated...I then refuted those with a source that shows otherwise and you have yet to refute that.\"\n\n \n I don't need to refute; it isn't going to make my position anymore right then it already is. I have already over-killed your argument. If you want to squabble over Hebrew words be my guest...not going to spend hours at a library finding the definitions of such words in a classical Hebrew dictionary. \n \n \n \n \n \n \"From a recent CBS poll, 24% of people outright don't support any abortion. 38% said stricter limits.

Possibly with Lexington KY (college town) having closer results to Louisville.\n If I target strong Blue states, and marginal Red states, the results will say RvW is supported. Reverse it and it's the opposite.\n Or, poll a N.O.W. convention of several hundred from 'all across america' and see the results...or the 'Bible Thumpers of America.'\n \n In general, other than a slight selection of people (like bible thumpers and activists or people who like to butt heads in a PnR forum) not many people really give a lot of thought to their stances on any issue. \n \n For example, I've met many pro-lifers who support abortion only in the case of threat to the mothers life OR abortion and incest. And, they're religious nutters. When asked, why they oppose abortion, the respond that it takes a human life and is murder. Self defense of the mothers life is understandable but, when pointed out that abortion of a normal rape or incest baby also results in the taking of a human like you get a emoticon_frazzled result often since they really haven't thought it through.\n \n There are many different types of pro-lifers as there are pro-choicers.\n A lot of europeans would seem to be extremely pro-choice but, most seem to find 3rd term abortion distasteful and it's not often allowed in their nations.\n There are hair splitters on when human life begins (person). And will make semi-arbirtary determinations like, 'conception' or '3rd term' or even 'when it can breath with it's own lungs'.\n If you say it's alive in the late 2nd term and abortion before that is ok but after wards is murder, are you 'pro-choice' or 'pro-life'? Seeing as your definition of life is different to others.\n \n To think that all members of either group have to be the same is laughable.\n Not all 'Pro-choicers' are the same like not all 'Pro-Lifers' are.\n A person who predominatly believes in the pro-life agenda isn't a pro-choicer if they make an exception. Nor is a pro-choicer if the situation is reversed. A pro-choicer can detest partial birth abortions and still be 'pro-choice' just as a pro-lifer can believe in an abortion for life theatening risks to mothers life and still be 'pro-life.'\n So, I find it funny when some point at the visable members of another group and say they are all the same.\n Of course, I'm also a hypocrit... ;)\n So, you big mean ole liberal baby killers (did you serve in Nam?) better watch out cause gawd itshelf is gonna lays smack downs upon your hiney...\n Ummm, quick toss me a line some nutter would use in a mud slinging contest.\n \n @Hunter, that's what I got.

I try to get a good scalp massage while I'm on the computer but, that's a little close to the demon idols on my desk and she seems to not be that enthusiastic around them. But, she shouldn't complain when I'm tripping over bibles left and right. \n Had I known she was going to turn out to be a fundy 12yrs ago, I'd have sped off faster than the roadrunner. But, that would have left an available fundy woman on the market. Can't have that happen. She might have hooked up with a fundy man and started another televangical ministry. Or, worse...bred with one and produced 100% fundy babies. *shudders*\n That's almost as bad as allowing 2 liberals to breed. :p",

I honestly think we do need to help out more..and not just with women but eveyone. And there are some groups out there that help pregnant women without ever recommending abortion. I am not sure how you fix unwanted pregnancy caused by two people having sex and realizing they just didn't want the pregnancy. You would have to do a major culture shift involving many things. However, having abortion, in my opinion, probably won't help people stop having sex but would encourage it. If there is a way out people will do it. I suspect that if abortion was banned and the next 5yrs or so many teens get pregnant then we would see a drop because people would get a bit smarter. So culture shift if the only way to get rid of that portion of abortions. The rape, incest, and probably the poor problem could be solved with some community support groups. Have people be less selfish (another culture shift). However, having abortion here wouldn't help people become less selfish because abortion in itself is selfish (atleast on someones part, not always the mother).\n \n So those are my views on it. I don't see people starting to help women until abortion is gone. One other side-not thing. The people that are more inclined to help are the ones that don't support abortion. This is obviously not a fact but is an opinion that I have observed. Church groups come to mind when I think of this.",

Now, that all assumes inflation isn't going anywhere. But inflation when it has nowhere to go but up causes some real problems. Sure, if inflation went to 6% and you were getting 4%, your buying power actually decreases by 2%. That $50,000 could have been invested in a higher interest, or could be removed to fund such a investment. Can't do that with a CD, you're stuck (unless you want to break the contract and get whacked with a high cancellation fee on top of the inflation difference).

During the 80s inflation hit 18%. Some CDs were offering mid 20%, and you can take a CD out for YEARS. Imagine investing $50,000 with 25% interest rate. Now imagine you signed the contract for 5 years. The rates fell very quickly. In the 90s inflation never broke 6%. You were litterally getting 19% return. Sick. That's $12,500 a year in nominal, but $9,500 in real money at 6% inflation. Now that's a long term investment that uses high interest rates which were based off of high inflation to profit when inflation has nowhere to go but down.

And since I actually am a woman - I am a little more qualified to judge that than you. You have NEVER, not even ONCE, acknowledged that the reasons that women choose abortion are serious. That these women have serious issues and needs that HAVE to be addressed for a successful pregnancy to occur. Steve is pro-choice and recognizes that. But not you. All you do is demonize and preach preach preach.\n \n Not only does your stance on abortion demean women, your stance on anything that deals with women demeans women. You are a garden variety sexist. \n \n \nOnly an up-side down deranged liberal could believe that.\n\n \n Only the truly unimaginative continually resort to stereotypes.\n \n \nSorry about your failure to keep your husband, divorce is a sad state of affair for this country.\n\n \n Can you read? I didn't fail to keep my husband - he failed to keep ME. I threw his sorry, lazy, abusive XXX out and I filed for divorce. Typical misogynist - thinks a woman can never be the one who walks. Or maybe I should have just let him keep on with the abuse? Wait for him to start on our little boy? Would the your misogynistic idea of God approved of that? I bet he would - the already born don't matter to Hunter - especially the female ones and the brown ones.\n \n \nIf you think that your divorce and your pro-death view on innocent children is compatable with a walk with the Lord; you need some very serious self examination. \n\n \n Further proof you can't read. We have been down this road before Hunter. Once again I ask you to show me where I said this OK with God? \n \n hmm?\n \n And I will ask you again now as I did then - where in the Bible do you get that the mistreatment, trivialization, domonization of women is OK?\n \n \nI wish you well in that regard. You need to walk to the light, not run from it. How can any Christian believe in murdering children knowing that every baby is a gift from the Lord? Answer: A true Christian can't!!\n\n \n Actually a Christian can believe a lot of things you don't. Your ego barely fits on this board. Continually speaking for the Lord you are. \n \n I think abortion is a sad horrible thing - and wish we could get more of you lifers on board to actually doing something about it. But you don't give a damn about babies. You just like to preach. You never offer a solution. You won't even discuss ways to help these mothers. You applaud the monkey for the butchery of already born brown children in Iraq.\n \n I believe in freedom of concious and choice. So does God. That's why we have it.

   "I was watching the Bill Maher show today and they had Jane Fonda on. She mentioned that she has recently become a Christian and that HER god is one that supports a womens right to choice. Now there are so many problems with this that I don't even know where to start. Not only that, I am saying this as almost a \"newbie\" Christian as in I don't know everything there is to know about the Bible. However, I do know that the Christian God that is defined in the Bible is against abortion. Many argue that the Bible is not what the Christian God is because it has been translated into a meaningless document. How is this true when we have so many of the original scrolls? Moreever, how can one claim what God thinks if they don't have anything to base it on? For example if you say the Bible is worthless, you are a Christian, and God believes abortion is ok...then how did you come to this conclusion? The Christian God talks about how one is created before they were put in the womb. God also talks about not killing. So if you wish to be Christian and for abortion you need to rethink one of those stances. God doesn't conform to anyone.\n\n \n \n I do agree with you. I also think that Jane either is supporting the wrong religion, or she has the wrong concept of it. \n \n God often tells us that our bodies are not ours, but his. So, if our outsides are not his, what makes us think that the insides are? Therefor, I don't think that it's right to get an abortion.\n \n Also, while \"HER\" God might be one of choice, the TRUE CHRISTIAN GOD is not. He has often told us to not kill, as it is even one of the Ten Holy Commandments. So, what makes us think that we have the right to take a baby's life?\n \n And don't confuse yourself. It might be a bunch of cells, but the cells evolve into something more. Therefor, it is considered a baby. If it's not, than why do you say that you are pregnant, when you find out that you are positive? To be pregnant means that you are with child, and your justification for getting an abortion is that it's not technically a child yet. SO does that mean that you are simply with cells?\n \n My question is not how can someone claim to know what God thinks when they have nothing to base it upon, but it is \"How can one, especially one that claims to be a Christian, claim to know what God thinks in the first place?\"\n \n We, as Christians, know that you can not tell God what to do, nor can you tell him what not to do. So, if you can't do those two things, how do you manage to know what he is thinking? I ponder this...\n \n And I agree:\n \n God doesn't conform to anyone.",

If you'd like I could give you verses in which he not only supported abortions, but ordered forced abortions through his people (that is if you take the OT as literally true)\n\n \n Let's see your best one (1) example. \n \n In the meantime, you can revel in this:\n \n What does the Bible say about abortion? \n \n \"And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life.\" (Exodus 21:22-23)\n \n Straight from the Jewish Torah, God immediately affirms the value of human life in a mother's womb.\n \n Next, a divinely appointed prophet from the womb:\n \n Jeremiah 1:5 - 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,\n before you were born I set you apart;\n I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.\"\n \n Psalm 139:13 - 'For you created my inmost being;\n you knit me together in my mother's womb.'\n \n Of course, the question here is: What divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mother's womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating? \n \n That was a future prophet to the nations in the womb. But the pro-infanticide crowd wants to pretend that instead of a baby with a divine plan, it's nothing more than an unviable tissue mass. Well, God is not fooled, and neither are we.\n \n Finally, every time you see another child playing and laughing, every time you see a boy or girl graduate, get married, have their own child, and so on, I hope you see that innocent little baby you had ripped from your body. \n \n I recommend you ask God / Christ to forgive you.",

Now there are so many problems with this that I don't even know where to start. Not only that, I am saying this as almost a \"newbie\" Christian as in I don't know everything there is to know about the Bible. However, I do know that the Christian God that is defined in the Bible is against abortion. Many argue that the Bible is not what the Christian God is because it has been translated into a meaningless document. How is this true when we have so many of the original scrolls? Moreever, how can one claim what God thinks if they don't have anything to base it on? For example if you say the Bible is worthless, you are a Christian, and God believes abortion is ok...then how did you come to this conclusion? The Christian God talks about how one is created before they were put in the womb. God also talks about not killing. So if you wish to be Christian and for abortion you need to rethink one of those stances. God doesn't conform to anyone.\n\n \n Have you read the Old Testament?

   "Okay I know I'm getting in on this debate late and quoting stuff from a long time ago but I was shocked that no one brought this up earlier in the discussion. \n \n \nI didn't see the word abortion in Luke. Maybe if you wouldn't mind so much could you please show me where God mentions something about it? Because I asked for a direct passage on abortion. Not one that you think/feel/believe that COULD be. I am looking for the concrete. Not the subjective.\n\n \n Linus, I can see your point. It seems like something that has become such a big issue these days would in some way be referenced by God in the Bible to lead believers in the right direction on this issue. I understand why you would want a concrete reference specifically to abortion to make the case for or against rock solid. \n \n But, just because God doesn't DIRECTLY say anything about abortion in any book in the Bible doesn't justify it. Abortion was not even created yet when the Bible was written, so you can't expect the biblical authors (who God spoke through but were still fully human) to write about it when it didn't exist! \n \n The Bible doesn't mention anything about murder by handgun. God doesn't mention murder by a bomb in the Bible. Both of these still go against the commandments and everything Jesus taught, so they are wrong. In the same way, you can extend this reasoning to the abortion debate.\n \n Even in a non-Christian context, you can't validly claim something is false just because there's no way to see it or it is not specifically referenced somewhere. For example, you can't see electrons. I truly doubt that you would make an argument against electrons just because you can't see them.\n \n In the same way, just because you can't see a way that the Bible doesn't specifically condemn abortion doesn't mean that it doesn't condemn abortion. Jeremiah 1:4-5 and Luke 1:15 (which have both already been quoted) point to God blessing and knowing babies in the womb, which should prove to those who believe in the Bible that unborn babies are people that have worth in the eyes of God. \n \n \nSo once again you didn't find a direct verse that said God was against abortion? So my point still stands. \n If God didn't want us killing someone in the womb then why did he order his followers to murder unborn babies of the Mideanites and Amalekites?\n How can you explain the barbaric tale of Numbers 5?\n\n \n In regards to your whole point about God killing babies with the flood, ordering the Israelites to kill people in Numbers, etc., those were the actions of God. They were not human actions. Godly actions are so far out of our comprehension that it is impossible to compare them to human ones. Therefore, you quoting these verses lends nothing to this argument. \n \n Corey Collins",

The word \"abortion\" does not appear in any translation of the bible!\n Out of more than 600 laws of Moses, none comments on abortion. One Mosaic law about miscarriage specifically contradicts the claim that the bible is antiabortion, clearly stating that miscarriage does not involve the death of a human being. If a woman has a miscarriage as the result of a fight, the man who caused it should be fined. If the woman dies, however, the culprit must be killed:\n \n \"If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.\n \n \"And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth . . .\"\n \n -Ex. 21:22-25\n The bible orders the death penalty for murder of a human being, but not for the expulsion of a fetus.\n When Does Life Begin?\n According to the bible, life begins at birth--when a baby draws its first breath. The bible defines life as \"breath\" in several significant passages, including the story of Adam's creation in Genesis 2:7, when God \"breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\" Jewish law traditionally considers that personhood begins at birth.\n \n Desperate for a biblical basis for their beliefs, some antiabortionists cite obscure passages, usually metaphors or poetic phrasing, such as: \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" Psalm 51:5 This is sexist, but does nothing other than to invoke original sin. It says nothing about abortion.The Commandments, Moses, Jesus and Paul ignored every chance to condemn abortion. If abortion was an important concern, why didn't the bible say so?\n \n Thou Shalt Not Kill?\n Many antiabortionists quote the sixth commandment, \"Thou shalt not kill\" (Ex. 20:13) as evidence that the bible is antiabortion. They fail to investigate the bible's definition of life (breath) or its deafening silence on abortion. Moreover, the Mosaic law in Exodus 21:22-25, directly following the Ten Commandments, makes it clear that an embryo or fetus is not a human being.\n An honest reader must admit that the bible contradicts itself. \"Thou shalt not kill\" did not apply to many living, breathing human beings, including children, who are routinely massacred in the bible. The Mosaic law orders \"Thou shalt kill\" people for committing such \"crimes\" as cursing one's father or mother (Ex. 21:17), for being a \"stubborn son\" (Deut. 21:18-21), for being a homosexual (Lev. 20:13), or even for picking up sticks on the Sabbath (Numbers 15:32-35)! Far from protecting the sanctity of life, the bible promotes capital punishment for conduct which no civilized person or nation would regard as criminal.\n Mass killings were routinely ordered, committed or approved by the God of the bible. One typical example is Numbers 25:4-9, when the Lord casually orders Moses to massacre 24,000 Israelites: \"Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord against the sun.\" Clearly, the bible is not pro-life!Most scholars and translators agree that the injunction against killing forbade only the murder of (already born) Hebrews. It was open season on everyone else, including children, pregnant women and newborn babies.\n \n Does God Kill Babies?\n \"Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.\"\n -Psalm 137:9\n The bible is not pro-child. Why did God set a bear upon 42 children just for teasing a prophet (2 Kings 2:23-24)? Far from demonstrating a \"pro-life\" attitude, the bible decimates innocent babies and pregnant women in passage after gory passage, starting with the flood and the wanton destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, progressing to the murder of the firstborn child of every household in Egypt (Ex. 12:29), and the New Testament threats of annihilation.\n \n Space permits only a small sampling of biblical commandments or threats to kill children:\n \n Numbers 31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones.\n Deuteronomy 2:34 utterly destroyed the men and the women and the little ones.\n Deuteronomy 28:53 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters.\n I Samuel 15:3 slay both man and woman, infant and suckling.\n 2 Kings 8:12 dash their children, and rip up their women with child.\n 2 Kings 15:16 all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.\n Isaiah 13:16 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished.\n Isaiah 13:18 They shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not spare children.\n Lamentations 2:20 Shall the women eat their fruit, and children.\n Ezekiel 9:6 Slay utterly old and young, both maids and little children.\n Hosea 9:14 give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.\n Hosea 13:16 their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.\n Then there are the dire warnings of Jesus in the New Testament:\n \n \"For, behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the womb that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.\"\n -Luke 23:29\n The teachings and contradictions of the bible show that antiabortionists do not have a \"scriptural base\" for their claim that their deity is \"pro-life.\" Spontaneous abortions occur far more often than medical abortions. Gynecology textbooks conservatively cite a 15% miscarriage rate, with one medical study finding a spontaneous abortion rate of almost 90% in very early pregnancy. That would make a deity in charge of nature the greatest abortionist in history!\n \n Are Bible Teachings Kind to Women?\n The bible is neither antiabortion nor pro-life, but does provide a biblical basis for the real motivation behind the antiabortion religious crusade: hatred of women. The bible is anti-woman, blaming women for sin, demanding subservience, mandating a slave/master relationship to men, and demonstrating contempt and lack of compassion:\n \n \"I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\"\n \n - Genesis 3:16\n What self-respecting woman today would submit willingly to such tyranny?\n \n The antiabortion position does not demonstrate love for humanity, or compassion for real human beings. Worldwatch Institute statistics show that 50% of abortions worldwide are illegal, and that at least 200,000 women die every year--and thousands more are hurt and maimed--from illegal or self-induced abortions. Unwanted pregnancies and complications from multiple pregnancies are a leading killer of women. Why do antiabortionists want North American women to join these ghastly mortality statistics? Every day around the world more than 40,000 people, mostly children, die from starvation or malnutrition. We must protect and cherish the right to life of the already-born.\n \n Do Churches Support Abortion Rights?\n Numerous Christian denominations and religious groups agree that the bible does not condemn abortion and that abortion should continue to be legal. These include:\n \n American Baptist Churches-USA\n American Ethical Union\n American Friends (Quaker) Service Committee\n American Jewish Congress\n Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\n Episcopal Church\n Lutheran Women's Caucus\n Moravian Church in America-Northern Province\n Presbyterian Church (USA)\n Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\n Union of American Hebrew Congregations\n Unitarian Universalist Association\n United Church of Christ\n United Methodist Church\n United Synagogue of America\n Women's Caucus Church of the Brethren\n YWCA\n Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice\n Catholics for Free Choice\n Evangelicals for Choice\n Belief that \"a human being exists at conception\" is a matter of faith, not fact. Legislating antiabortion faith would be as immoral and unAmerican as passing a law that all citizens must attend Catholic mass!\n \n The bible does not condemn abortion; but even if it did, we live under a secular constitution, not in a theocracy. The separation of church and state, the right to privacy, and women's rights all demand freedom of choice.\n \n \n Sorry, but you have no argument that holds any water. -poet",
