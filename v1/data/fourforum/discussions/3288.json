The idea is that if you don't give people cause to hate you enoguh to be willing to die just to spit in your eye, they won't be lining up to do it. There simply aren;t enough psychcopaths in the world to account for the number of presumed terrorists out there. Therefore, it logically follows that there must be some reason beyon complete delusional hate that they are choosing to strike at America. \n \n I am certainly not saying that everybody in the world wants peace, but the vast, vast majority of people in the world prefer not to be killed (survival instinct perhaps). When you are dealing with people who arew so seriously dedicated to a cuase that they are lining up to die for it, logic would dictate that there is some reason for this.\n \n \nThe problem is that while most people can be rational, it does not follow that most people want peace. Or that all people can be peaceful.\n\n \n I still say the vast, vast majority want peace, they just want it on their terms. The trick is that evcerybody has to have enoguh of \"their terms\" to keep them from killing other folks. \n \n Not all people can be paceful? Pls explain.\n \n \nAnd what kind of people are we fighting? Has anyone seen the Olin beheading on video? It is not clean and tidy like an Elizabethan head lopping. \n \n \n Elizabethan head loppings commonly took 5 or 6 good whacks, and the executioners generally missed the neck and got the shoulders, or the top of the head on the first couple of hits. The crowd gave them tips for a good show. This is why most prominent families during the period had their own private executioners. They paid these guys and fed them to ensure that if the time came to get their heads lopped off they had a well paid, knowledgable person doing the lopping. It was also customary for those who did not have private executioners to tip the public executioner in hopes that they would be merciful and get you on the first try.\n \n \nIt is not fast. It can best be described as the sawing off of a living head with a paring knife while the victim screams in pain. \n \n \n It wasn;'t a paring knife, adn if you really think about it, not that bad a way to die. Over in less than a minute and you most likely only feel the first 10 seconds, then you are in shock. Not as good as dying in your sleep, but certainly better than dying over the course of 2 or 3 days in a hospital after your \"liberators\" bomb your home.\n \n \nIt is a deliberately cruel atrocity perpetrated by vicious animals.\n \n \n Actually, it is a well thought out, traditional form of execution. The Arabs quit chopping peoples heads off with axes and swords and such several thousands of years ago because it was seen as inhumane for the very reasons that the elizabethans tipped their executioners, it is hard to do a thorough and complete job with one wack. It often took several blows to take off somebodies head, and could take over a minute to finally get the job done since the executioner had to wind up again after each blow. Cutting their head off with a knife is quick, clean, and sure, though it is more work for the executioner.\n \n You want cruel execution? Check out the british and early Americans. We hung people, but not the quick, neck popping hangings of the old west. They would tie a rope aroudn their neck and hoist them up. there are accoutns of people who took several hours (sometimes an entire day) to finally die. Nasty stuff.\n \n \nIt is the most gruesome and disgusting thing I have ever seen. It opens a window on the mind of the enemy. I would post the link, but I'm not sure it would be allowed here\n\n \n You need to get out more. it isn't that bad. Certainly unpleasant, but reasonably short. \n \n You want cruel and disgusting? I went on a medic call today (I am a volunteer paramedic in my community) and treated a kid who had been locked in a closet for 2 weeks and given a 20 oz bottle of water per day. Kid was stick figure thin, covered in bed sores and excrement. This was an 8 yr old boy who kept wetting the bed (wonder why).\n \n Oddly enough, child abuse is almost unknown in the Arab world, where these \"vicious animals\" come from. America leads the world in that one.\n \n GOD BLESS THE USA",

A large number of our population lives with a thin veneer of civilization covering their racism and hate. Go back to pre-1960s, before the federal government used its might to force integration if you want multiple incidents. If you haven't noticed, we're currently being programed to use that hate against other ethnic groups. \n \n If we were invaded and our country destroyed at the level Iraq has experienced, most all the people I know and myself would consider any representative of the occupying force, military or civilian, as enemies to be killed, especially if they were forcing their ideology on us. I would also consider anyone so passive as to accept occupying power reconstruction of my country's primary economic asset while the citizenry was unemployed to be a fool.

It's just instinct to want this. It's ludicrous to think that the average Iraqi doesn't want a normal peaceful life.\n\n \n First, you ask if the average Iraqi condone such acts. Let me broaden the question to include the \"average Muslim\". No, the average Muslim or Iraqi doesn't condone it, but neither do they condemn it. This distinction is important simply because the average person is not a fanatic of one belief or another and as such does not adopt radicalism of any sort. The average person DOES however lean in one direction or another, and the vast majority of Muslims lean to varying degrees toward the Jihadists. Restated, there is a great deal of latent sympathy toward the Islamofascists out there.\n \n Second, I don't believe I said that \"most\" people don't desire peace. I think most people do. Many do not. Radicals do not, because they are by definition anti-status quo, and war is the best way to overthrow the status quo. Neville Chamberlain once said:\n \n \"We should seek by all means in our power to avoid war, by analysing possible causes, by trying to remove them, by discussion in a spirit of collaboration and good will.\"\n \n The problem is with his base assumption...that all parties desired peace. Hitler did not. Al Queda does not. Short of tearing down our society, we will not satisfy them. Were the US to pull out of the middle east...were the US to hitail it out of both Afghanistan and Iraq...were we to do exactly, in every particular, what the Jihadists demand, we would suddenly, like Chamberlain, be faced with new demands, and then more.\n \n It goes against your obviously rational and liberal values, but we have to fight this 6th century barbarism.

Survival motivation, regardless of the circumstances, overcomes all social conditioning.\n\n \n It is not a question of \"capability\", and I am not suggesting that Americans are genetically or inherently distinct from Islamofascists. This is a bit of a strawman on your part. What I am saying, obviously, is that the fanaticism of Islamofascism allows them to overcome the bounds of decency. This transcendence occurs as an organization...not as a human aberration as in the case of dragging someone behind a pickup truck. It is an important distiction to make...to compare apples to apples one has to compare the US government to the leadership of each group.\n \n The use of napalm and nukes is different...not in effect, but in rule of law...from sawing off the heads of innocents. Whatever one may think of law, without it we would be in a state of nature...and not the nature of Rousseau, but of Hobbes. The rules of war allow the use of force in war. War is within the bounds of international law. Without the conventions of war, and without adherence to them, we would be screwed. Look at the hoopla over \"torture\" that took place illegally in Iraqi proisons by a few guards. \n \n There is a difference also between killing and the deliberate and unecessary cruelty with which killing is done. Radiation and napalm burns are indiscriminate, regardless of how they stack up to beheading on a pain scale. An individual does not intentionally burn another individual with the intent of causing pain in war. He does it to kill, and the quicker the better. There is no intent to cause pain. \n \n As for the intentional cruelty of the beheading, someone earlier tried to make the case that it was in fact humane. This is nonsense, as is much of the revisionism he used in support of his contention. The assertion, for instance, that beheading with a sword was discarded in favor of a knife \"thousands of years ago\" is ********. The Saudis use a sword today and always have. So, as far as I know, do all the gulf states, and the more progressive Islamic nations don't use beheading as a punishment at all. During the reign of Edward I of England beheadings were rather gory, but by the time of Elizabeth it was a distinct aberration to have hackings about the shoulders and back. I could go on, but suffice it to say that the method of beheading used in this case is the epitome of barbarism. Only takes a minute? Try counting to 60 by means of \"one thousand one, one thousand two...\" while someone hacks away at your neck with...yes...a paring knife.",
