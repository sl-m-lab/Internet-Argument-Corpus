If you visit my site\n (below)you will see some of the arguments which should be considered. Because there is so little turnover in Congress,\n you have no idea how many \"Lincolnesque\" type individuals don't even consider running for office. And if they do, and win, they never get to do anything because they don't have seniority.\n \n And who says the 'neophytes' don't have more brains and talent than the tenured pols who have never had to earn a paycheck in the real world? \n Real world citizens have real experience, professional politicians only have cunning as to how to game the system!\n \n nels96\n www.tenurecorrupts.com",
