   "A little late in posting but since I'm a major Dodgers fan just wanted to give a shout out to my lifelong favorite team! Congratulations! And hopefully we'll see them go to the World Series. Oh and food for thought, the Dodgers have not won a World Series since I was born. Yep 21 years ago. I still have the baby shirt my dad bought from Dodger stadium when he saw them play in the Series along with an autographed ball by the entire team that I still have in safe keeping.\n \n \n \n Go Dodgers!! emoticon_xbouncer",
