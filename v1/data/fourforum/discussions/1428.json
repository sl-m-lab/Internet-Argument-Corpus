(One boy from my year came close to killing one of them when he 'speared' their car - he threw a sharpened metal stake at them as they cruised around our school looking for trouble).

I do have several Catholic friends and have attended a few Catholic services, which I enjoyed.\n\n \n I think we touched upon it - that we (the traditionalists; Catholic and Orthodox) maintain that not only was Mary a virgin before the birth of Jesus, but also during, and after. That she never had any other children.\n \n \nI have a few questions for you. Does the Orthodox Church have a pope?\n\n \n The short answer is 'no'. The long answer follows; which helps explain the difference between Orthodoxy and Catholicism.\n \n The best thing I can do; if it's not to boring is to give a very brief history\n \n Jesus founded the Church. He commissioned Apostles to act as custodians of Holy Tradition. These Apostles were the first leaders (bishops) and they kept the knowledge of right teachings.\n \n Over time the chief Sees (bishoprics) developed around Rome, Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem, and at Constantinople; which were the chief cities of the Roman world. We hold that each of these bishoprics are equal - but that we (used to) call Rome first of equals - like the Chairman at a meeting.\n \n When the Roman Empire collapsed in the West it continued on in the East for another 1,000 years (ending c.1453). This caused the first division - Rome was mostly cut-off from the other Sees. As the West rebuilt it's church structure, it was at the behest of the Bishop in Rome - whereas we maintained in the East, Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem and Constantinople continued as a collegiate system. Thus in the west all Churches began to take their orders from Rome, in the East no one church dominated the others.\n \n When we took Christianity to other areas - such as to the Bulgars we established a Church for them. Once we did so, we basically said \"Okay, you have the tools to work, you run things yourself\" Thus adding to the collegiate system. This continued until quite recently thus we have Serbian Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Bulgarian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox etc and my own; Antiochian Orthodox (which as the name suggests is based in Antioch). Each Church kept in contact with each other and would meet in Councils of Bishops - with eventually the Bishop in Constantinople taking over the role of chairman.\n \n Whereas in the West the one church as it spread, maintained control. It would for instance go into Germany, and instead of creating the liturgy in German (which we would have done), said that Latin must remain the language of the liturgy. Even independent churches, like the Celtic Churches founded by St. Patrick and St. Columba were forced to swear allegiance to Rome (at the Synod of Whitby). \n \n Rome began taking more and more power and made decisions without consulting other bishops in Council. Rome also demanded that we easterners pay homage to Roman supremacy as western churches did.\n \n This led to an official split between the two halves of the church. We continued on our way, Rome did likewise. We both have a common ground in Church Fathers and Holy Tradition that was established before the split. Thus we can both agree on a large number of things.\n \n For us, the leader in each one area is called something different. Some are called Metropolitan, some are Patriarchs etc, but this denotes no supremacy over any other bishop - I think this is even within one's own See - thus the Metropolitan in Constantinople is the equal of all the other Bishops in the Greek church (but he is the chairman of the board)\n \n Unfortunately when Orthodoxy went to America, and to Australia, they broke with tradition and you find Greek, Russian etc within the same area. No Bishop is supposed to be in the area of another Bishop. \n \n In America they have started to rectify this by creating the American Orthodox Church but this is only in its infancy. But people being failed humans are clinging to power and don't want to give this up. And, to add to the confusion, the American Orthodox Church has come to Australia! It is also un-Orthodox for an Orthodox Church to be speaking Greek, in Australia - who's language is English. This is another thing that we have to over-come.\n \n My own Church; the Antiochian Orthodox Church has regular English speaking services - which is why I went along - as otherwise all Orthodox Churches are the same.\n \n Further, during the Soviet years, the Russian Orthodox Churches outside of Russia refused to take instructions from the Russian Orthodox Churches within Russia - because Stalin forced a puppet into the seat in Moscow - so there are two Russian Orthodox Churches. We have been a captive Church - to the Turks, and then to the Soviets. These periods also put the brakes on our missionary works so that Catholicism has leapt ahead of us in this regard.\n \n We were once a single Church with the Roman one. Thus when we say \"We believe in One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church\" we believe that to be us... Catholic meaning simply 'universal'.\n \n Out Divine Liturgy (which Catholics call the Mass) was developed about the year 300. In the West, a separate Liturgical tradition grew up - which is now being rediscovered as some westerners are re-developing the Orthodox Church in Britain. Many Anglicans, unhappy with their church are re-discovering the Orthodox roots of Christianity in the West. This is the only place I'm aware of within the Orthodox Church that has a different Liturgy.\n \n In understanding this, too there is light now shone on the reason we don't just believe in the Bible. We can read the words of Bishops that wrote before the Bible was ever put together; such as St. Clement of Rome and St.Ignatius of Antioch; both Sees founded by St. Peter.\n \n \n Does the Orthodox Church and/or the Catholic Church for those that might be reading this, believe that Protestants are saved?\n\n \n We do believe that it is possible.\n \n http://www.unicorne.org/orthodoxy/a...wers/heaven.htm has a question and answer page which deals with that subject...\n \"Now with regard to your final question as to whether you must convert to be saved. With all humility - alas, many of us are not humble! - we Orthodox maintain that the clearest vision of the truth is available through the priceless heritage that we have obtained. We do not however maintain that those who are not here and now linked visibly, palpably to the Orthodox Church are doomed to hell. That is just the kind of literal approach I have tried to avoid in my long-winded answer.\n  It is not Church membership that saves us, but a loving relationship with the Lord and His creation. He does not look at our membership card but at our heart! The brother who has told you that you would be damned if you do not join the Orthodox Church (perhaps you misunderstood him, or he spoke hastily without thinking of the implication of his words?) also has to bring his heart, not his membership card to the Lord for inspection - continually and humbly.\"\n \n But we do believe Orthodoxy is the best way.\n \n Another difference too that emerged is that because Catholicism grew up under Rome it is more rational-legalistic than our church - which is 'eastern' and therefore more a church of 'mystery'.\n \n Getting back to Mary; I don't know if you'd accept it as a valid point - but we have always maintained certain extra-Biblica beliefs - they do not conflict with the Bible. One is Mary's perpetual virginity.\n http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/evervirgin.htm \n \n \n post script\n Catholics will argue that the Church in Rome was always a Supreme Head of all the other Churches - thus they see no problem with the Pope making pronouncements ('pontificating' if you will).",

   "Actually, when I was growing up Catholic - I believed it was about Jesus too! You'd be amazed how few Catholics are aware that they now worship a demi-god.\n\n \n Catholics never have and never will worship Mary. We venerate her.\n \n Montalban,\n \n \nThis is also a doctrine that they have come up with by themselves, quite recently in fact; in the 1800's. (http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07674d.htm)\n\n \n Modern Catholics did not invent the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, nor did the Pope. \n \n St. Augustine wrote this in the 4th century, \"When it is a matter of sin we must except the holy Virgin Mary, concerning whom I will have no question raised, owing to the honor due to Our Lord.\" \n \n St. Ephrem (4th Century) also taught the Immaculate Conception.\n \n When the dogma was defined in 1854, a new truth was not added to the Revelation but it was defined that this teaching was always a part of the original revelation. Often a dogma is believed for years before it is defined and often it is only officially defined due to circumstances/challenges surrounding the belief.\n \n \nI believe their rationale is that Jesus was without sin therefore the 'vessel' which contained Him must also be pure.\n\n \n Not exactly, that would mean that Mary's mother would have to be without sin to contain Mary who was without sin. And that would mean that St. Anne's mother...\n \n \nWe believe that Mary was made sinless at the time of conception of Jesus; thus she still 'needed' Jesus to be saved. And it also allows for the 'purity of the vessel' argument.\n \n Whereas Catholics say she herself was conceived without sin, therefore I believe that they are saying that she doesn't need Jesus to be saved; why would she - if she was sinless.\n\n \n Wrong again. The Catholics do not say that Mary does not need a savior.\n \n Regarding the Immaculate Conception: Here is some food for thought. Consider this allegory. You are walking along a remote path in the woods that is unfamiliar to you. Suddenly, you lose your footing and fall in a huge pit that was covered with leaves and branches. As much as you struggle and fight, you cannot get out of the pit by yourself. A park ranger hears your cries for help and he comes along and pulls you out of the pit. The ranger has just saved your life. You surely would have perished in the cold with no shelter, food, or water. A short time later, the park ranger sees someone coming up the path and he jumps in front of her just as she is about to fall in the pit. He grabs her and pulls her aside, telling her of the danger. Has the park ranger saved both of you? Yes. \"Mary is not sinless by her own power, virtue, or merit. It \n was not her merits but those of her Son, which were applied to her at conception. The primacy and necessity of the Incarnation and Christ's fullness are not diminished by Mary's Immaculate Conception, because more than any other human being, she received of his fullness (John 1:16).\" * Luther believed this, as I have already demonstrated with his own writings. Jesus saved Mary just as he saves us. He just chose a different time frame with her. \n \n *Father Mateo, Refuting the Attack on Mary  (San Diego, Catholic Answers 1993), 25-26.\n \n God made Adam and Eve \"perfect and holy.\" Consider the fact that Mary is the new Eve. Why? Because God said in Genesis 3 that Eve's offspring and the serpent's would live with enmity between them. Eve's seed would bruise the head of the serpent (as you also mentioned in your letter when writing on Purgatory). Mary's seed is Christ, who crushed the head of the serpent because he destroyed death with his gift of grace. He destroyed Satan's work. Mary was created perfect and holy like Eve. Eve welcomed death into the world at the tree in Eden. Mary welcomed eternal life through her son at the tree (crucifix) on Golgotha. Eve rejected God and welcomed sin into the world. Mary rejected sin and welcomed God into the world. Mary chose not to sin by cooperating with the grace of God when she said, \"I am the handmaid of the Lord. Be it done to me according to your will.\" Again the Old Testament imperfectly foreshadows the New Testament perfection. Mary was \"full of grace.\"Only Jesus is spoken of in this manner. (Look into the use of the word kecharitomene in Luke 1:28). \n \n \nThey have taken the veneration of the Theotokos (the Mother of God) almost to the point of her being part of the Trinity - which itself would have to be changed to Father, Son, Holy Ghost & Mary\n\n \n No we haven't.\n \n By the way, the pope does not dictate to Catholics. He is not a dictator, he is a vicar. He does not simply proclaim doctrine of his own accord either. There is more to it than that and you know it.",

But that this came about when Jesus became incarnate within her... thus she still needed Jesus to be saved. You would have it that she did not - why would she if she was already in a state of Grace from her inception?\n \n It is an attempt to rationalise a decision in dogma to suggest that it was something you always believed in; such as in the filioque controversy.\n \n In a similar fashion comes papal supremecy - to make a decision then to go back and try and find things that allude to it.\n \n The Catholic Church is a kingdom - the Pope is the King (and yes you can have limited elected kings - such as in the Kingdom of Poland -where nobles elected one of their number to be king).\n \n The Pope can claim to speak the exact words of God - without error.

I don't know why.\n \n I do believe it is to undermine Orthodoxy - which is why your 'valid' reasons don't apply to those who defect to Catholicism.\n \n Neither do the 'valid' resons for supporting the addition to the Nicene Creed.\n \n I do like how you refer to it though - 'Christian unity', which means 'only Catholicism'... so much for not wanting to undermine Orthodoxy.\n \n I also don't actually think that inter-religious dialogue is a good thing, not if you believe you hold the truth.\n \n The Catholic West launched a Crusade against our church in 1204. It didn't help us in the 1400s when we were beset by the Turks - excepting if we acknowledge Catholic falsehoods first.\n \n Catholics from Poland set about suppressing Orthdoxy in their realms.\n \n The list goes on.\n \n Attacks physical and doctrinal.\n\n \n Mont,\n I never said that inter-religious dialogue meant compromising the truth. Ecumenism that sacrifices the truth is worthless. Holding the truth is good but you must bring others into the truth. Christianity is not isolationism--in the world but not of the world.\n \n Now tell me how allowing clergy to remained married undermines the Orthodox faith. The clergy that are converting aren't converting because of marriage. They already have that option in Orthodoxy. Marriage is not the attraction. They are converting because they want to, because they have found more in Catholicism. Marriage does not attract them, something else does. These men are not being coerced.\n \n What do you think of the Russian Orthodox Church's usurpation of Catholic Churches/property/dioceses that has occurred in the past? What do you think of their current resistance to giving up those things that were Catholic?\n \n The only Church that demonstrates the unity instituted by Christ is the Catholic Church. The only Church that has the unifying authority granted by Christ is the Catholic Church. Have you gotten Soloviev's book yet?",

They are converting because they want to, because they have found more in Catholicism. Marriage does not attract them, something else does. These men are not being coerced.\n\n \n Not the issue. I don't care, for the sake of this argument, that people are moving or not moving towards Orthodoxy on the basis of married clergy. That is, beside the point... especially as you allow Orthodox who have defected to remain married\n \n The point is you have an idea about married priests, within Catholicsm, which I've heard heaps of arguments about, in favour of (from Catholics), yet you guys undermine this dogged stance by allowing so many exceptions - in order to attract believers away.\n \n Marriage, is in a sense, made a non-issue, because you create the exceptions. If you didn't then it would be an issue, because the priest thinking about defecting would also have to decide on the issue of marriage vs celibacy. You put it in as a sweetner - saying \"Don't worry, you can still marry\"\n \n \nWhat do you think of the Russian Orthodox Church's usurpation of Catholic Churches/property/dioceses that has occurred in the past? What do you think of their current resistance to giving up those things that were Catholic?\n\n \n Indeed. On an issue of scale though I think, allowing Constantinople to fall is far worse (even attacking it in 1204 is still worse).\n \n But in context, Russia is an Orthodox nation. It became so c.988. What are Catholics been doing? Seeking to convert Russians.\n \n When Russia was a middle-weight power, you used Catholic Poland to discriminate against Orthodoxy - it would be better to admit these churches have been 're-claimed'.\n \n \nThe only Church that demonstrates the unity instituted by Christ is the Catholic Church. The only Church that has the unifying authority granted by Christ is the Catholic Church. Have you gotten Soloviev's book yet?\n\n \n Not true. I can go from Catholic Church to Catholic Church and have a plethora of Liturgies presented to me. Ones in Latin, or English, with Chorals, Chanting or Rock; ones where the children pass out the chalice, ones where the wafer (not bread) only is given to the laity, ones where the laity get both.*\n Ones where the service has the original statement of faith of the Nicence Creed, one's where it's been modified.\n Ones where Charismatic Catholics jump and wail, others not.\n \n Catholicism has given the okay to anti-God theory such as evolution - saying it's not inconsistent with Christianity, when it is.\n \n \n Do you count \"Old Catholics\" as Catholic?\n \n \n *When I was young they sang such songs as \"Let It Be\" at St.Joseph's Catholic Church, Enfield. I enjoyed it though, 'cause the Mass only went about 45mins, whereas the Mass in Ashfield or Concord went well over an hour.",

An example might be, that I believe that there is gas in the tank of my car. My guage is broken and it has been a while since I filled it. I don't really know how much I have but I think I have enough to get home. Therefore, I get in the car start it and attempt to drive home. Faith is the acting on something you believe rather than just believing something. I know a lot of people that say they trust God and live their lives trying to control everyone and everything around them. They show no faith. They say they believe, but don't really. \n \n The issue then becomes what do you put your trust in? I submit that if one puts their faith in the thing that is true then their faith is well placed. eg. I didn't make it home because I ran out of gas. My faith was not placed in that which is true. I can believe there is gas in the tank but if there is not, then I am screwed. I can even get others to believe it with me but if there is not gas in my tank I am still screwed. I can start a whole religion about believing that my tank has gas and can get millions to believe it and even to send me money to show that they believe it, but that doesn't mean there is gas in my tank. (With all the money though I could by gas and get the guage fixed.) emoticon_xangel",
