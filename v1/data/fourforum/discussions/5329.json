It's written very simplistic so it's not a \"technical\" read, it moves fast and stays light. The end get's a little philosophically nonsensical, but it had some clinical studies about just that sort of thing. How does the mind differntiate what is real, and what is not. Some of the stories are really mind boggling. A fun read otherwise I wouldn't mention it.\n \n Phantoms in the Brain : Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind\n by V. S. Ramachandran\n \n http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0688172172/104-5524229-4656711?v=glance\n \n In short, evidence seems to suggest there are \"areas\" (in a functional sense) of the brain that control differentiating \"reality\" from fantasy. Other areas that actually know how to do things that consciously we do not, and in some cases the area of the brain that keeps the leash on the unconscious idiot is damaged...and people do things, literally, that they not only didn't plan on doing, but didnt' want to do (choke themselves). It's outrageous, I know, but everything dealing with brain functions is crazy. \n \n For instance, split brain:\n http://www.macalester.edu/~psych/whathap/UBNRP/Split_Brain/Split_Brain_Consciousness.html\n \n I ran into this in a pshychology book years ago, it was a treatment for severe epilepsy (that sort of worked), where they cut the nerve bundle that connects the two brain hemispheres. Low and behold, the left and right hemisphere could learn things, but could not share them, but you could get both to answer questions correctly. \n \n -Mach",

Thanks for replying.\n \n \n (1) Knowing 'the truth' would likely not be conducive to replicating but the genetic component might be a 'trade off' for some other 'advantage' which tips the scale back to being an overall advantage. \n\n The kind of truth I'm talking about is philosophical truth. For example, that one is a bag of self-replicating proteins; not that sharp sticks are better than blunt ones. It seems advantageous to know that sharp sticks are better than blunt ones, but it does not seems advantageous to view yourself as a self-replicating bag of proteins as opposed to a sole with eternal life.\n \n \n (2) You use the word 'stupid' when I would use the word 'blind' so \"people are better off being immensely blind\". \n\n Blindness is one thing, I guess. But one really must be stupid to believe so wholeheartedly in knowing the truth (e.g., christianity) when the guy across the street believes just as wholeheartedly in knowing a different truth (moslem). Do you deny that this is incredibly stupid? \n \n \n (3) The chimp philosopher thing... erm... no i haven't noticed chimps are better philosophers than the average human. \n\n Well notice (think about it). I imagine that chimps pretty much think that things are. I don't imagine that they think they are an eternal sole, that there are sins, and that some bloke died for those sins on a cross 2000 years ago. \n \n \n I think animals don't have our level of consciousness and in fact human consciousness is a massive evolutionary gamble. \n\n \n And exactly why do you think chimps don't have our level of consciousness? Do you have any evidence? Chimps are self aware tending to indicate that they are conscious. How does one measure the difference in consciousness? Surely we are better trained and have the \"advantage\" of more accrued learning (we write stuff down), and it seems likely that we simply have more mental horsepower, but I would not confuse those with consciousness, because the conscious mind does not think.\n \n As to consciousness being an evolutionary gamble, I could not agree more.\n \n \n On the whole human consciousness allowed us (in part) to become the dominant species and achieve all that we have...\n\n I would agree that there seems to a correlation between consciousness and dominance, but I do not think that you've shown cause and effect. It seems quite possible that consciousness is not an advantage in and of itself, but a weird by-product. My guess is that consciousness was the easiest path toward higher thinking. Note for example that dolphins evidently evolved their consciousness (self-awareness) separately from ours. Consciousness isn't the only possible path, but the easy path.\n \n \n ...but it can lead on an individual basis to a state of mind where biological drives can be considered trivial (at best) and not acted upon.\n\n \n I'm sorry; I'm not following.",

   "It is arguable whether eternally not achieving removal from the wheel of life is eternal punishment through suffering. \n\n Well, I think one eventually meets his guru and he assists the one in getting off the wheel. Anyway, this seems to be tangential to the central theme.\n \n \nDepends on the parents but provoking confrontation between yourself and your main care giver as a minor is innevitably going to cause some amount of conflict. \n\n Since there is no Darwinistic advantage in conflict, as one might end up dead or damaged, it is best to believe whatever nonsense is being spouted. There is a tremendous correlation between the religious beliefs of parents and children. This suggests that there is a Darwinistic advantage in stupidity (believing whatever nonsense happens to be present). \n \n \nUmmm... yes and no, I think what you're suggesting is part of the reason why new age spirirtuality is becoming more popular. \n\n No: I'm not trying to suggest anything about new age religions. I think you were arguing that there was an advantage in not believing religions, because it gave greater freedom in doing things that might allow better self-replication. I'm arguing that one should want to give the appearance of conformance to the prevailing religion, but should do whatever he finds convenient and justify it (spin it up). Does not a chaplain pray over men before they go into battle? In other words, religion (usually) does not get in the way of Darwinistic expediency, but rather supports it. \n \n \nSome people will have problems when they realise they are just picking and choosing what they want froma religion/god. \n\n The only problem they have is not replicating more replicators. When people start having such realizations, they tend not to replicate as much. Stop being philosophical and find yourself a nice catholic. \n \n \nAgain yes and no, I see both 'slurping up' and 'imposed ignorance' -- I have witnessed people choose not to investiaget certain matters because they have an inkling that the answers may shake their belief system. \n\n Their \"choice\" is an illusion. They are merely acting in accordance with whatever slurping they have been doing. Do they want their belief system shaken? Heck no. How does it benefit them Darwinistically to have their beliefs shredded? Do reasonable people replicate more? \n \n \nDepends what you choose... as to whether I'd call you stupid. \n \n Let's look at the situation of the African and the Native American with respect to slavery in the Caribbean. It appears that the Natives would rather be dead than be slaves, and thus were (essentially) wiped out. Africans, not suffering from tremendous pride, generally took the other alternative. The question is not what is pleasant, but solely what supports replication. It is probably helpful for a slave to view himself lower than the master, just so long as he gets to replicate. Just as you say, the Native may have been right, but the Native is also dead. The African may have been miserable, but alive and replicable. \n \n \nBy keeping a closed mind? \n \n Not: How does one stay ignorant? But: How does one obtain ignorance if one is not already?\n \n \nYes despite being 22 and not having a child I can empathise with this dilema as I have often thought about the problem myself. \n \n Well, let me know if you have any revelations. I still have this notion that it is best to mate with somebody religious. I did not; therefore to some extent my hand is played. \n \n \nI find that many people have to choose whether they want to be 'happy' or 'right' thats not to say both are mutually exclusive but one has to be chosen as the main 'target' in life. \n \n I don't believe choices like that are made. One can dupe oneself into believing that some such choice is made, but this is largely an illusion. One can proclaim to have eaten his last doughnut, but that doesn't make it so. These mental games are mostly a charade to preserve the ego.\n \n \nWhile existance is harsh I feel animals are more content with this reality than humans are (with our consciousness). \n \n Possibly they are. However, I'm not very comfortable with the projection of one mentality onto another (if that's what's happening). You do not know how another person feels contentment, much less a chimp. I would hazard a guess that chimps in the wild do not commit suicide at the same rates as humans, but perhaps it doesn't occur to them. It's really tough to say much definitively. Nonetheless our feelings (romantic as they may be) seem to jibe.\n \n \nI think unless you believe that the monk in my example actually does achieve a higher plane of eternal existance then you are correct in your comments. \n\n I do not see how my comments are undone even if the monk attains enlightenment.

   "Since there is no Darwinistic advantage in conflict, as one might end up dead or damaged, it is best to believe whatever nonsense is being spouted. There is a tremendous correlation between the religious beliefs of parents and children. This suggests that there is a Darwinistic advantage in stupidity (believing whatever nonsense happens to be present).\n\n \n If your parents think it then likely your surrounding community does too. Remember 'multi-cultural civilisation' is not what humans evolved to live like rather we are pack/troop/tribe animals. Anyway, I agree with your comments although I'm slightly 'unsure' regarding the use of the word 'stupid' as you know from my previous comments.\n \n \nNo: I'm not trying to suggest anything about new age religions. I think you were arguing that there was an advantage in not believing religions, because it gave greater freedom in doing things that might allow better self-replication. I'm arguing that one should want to give the appearance of conformance to the prevailing religion, but should do whatever he finds convenient and justify it (spin it up). Does not a chaplain pray over men before they go into battle? In other words, religion (usually) does not get in the way of Darwinistic expediency, but rather supports it.\n\n \n I think that while not being religious would give hefty advantages it would also make the individual a pariah so I'd have to judge the relative merits on a case by case scenario.\n \n \nThe only problem they have is not replicating more replicators. When people start having such realizations, they tend not to replicate as much. Stop being philosophical and find yourself a nice catholic.\n\n \n Again, I can tend to agree with you but then I ponder about people becoming hedonists, or rapists (especially in a religious society that prohibits abortion).\n \n I'm some what reminded of Genghis Khan -- suggested to be the most prolific man in history. Mr Khan took advice supposedly from various eastern monks in his later years about extending his life and they proposed the benefits of abistenance (well a bit more complicated but the end result is the same). Khan was reportedly not religious (although he did bring in laws that forbade overt religious or racial persecution).\n \n \n Their \"choice\" is an illusion. They are merely acting in accordance with whatever slurping they have been doing. Do they want their belief system shaken? Heck no. How does it benefit them Darwinistically to have their beliefs shredded? \n\n \n I'm tempted to agree with you...\n \n \n Do reasonable people replicate more? \n\n \n See above.\n \n \n Let's look at the situation of the African and the Native American with respect to slavery in the Caribbean. It appears that the Natives would rather be dead than be slaves, and thus were (essentially) wiped out. Africans, not suffering from tremendous pride, generally took the other alternative. The question is not what is pleasant, but solely what supports replication. It is probably helpful for a slave to view himself lower than the master, just so long as he gets to replicate. Just as you say, the Native may have been right, but the Native is also dead. The African may have been miserable, but alive and replicable. \n\n \n *Nods in agreement*\n \n Again it depends whether or not there really is some otherworldly benefit to be 'right' rather than 'alive and replicating'.\n \n \nHow does one obtain ignorance if one is not already?\n\n \n Highly difficult question... I'm not sure it is possible in the context of what we are discussing.\n \n Depends how you would define 'one' -- you could choose to destroy your brain's higher reasoning functions until the point that for all intense and purposes you regress to ignorance and remain in such a state perpetually. The problem arises as to whether one still regards himself as the same 'person' after such damage.\n \n \n Well, let me know if you have any revelations. I still have this notion that it is best to mate with somebody religious. I did not; therefore to some extent my hand is played. \n\n \n Ha! You should get in contact with a member of the board called Zardoz who I know from another forum. Zardoz married a staunch christian despite being an agnostic himself (well, I think he would describe himself as much). I have often read with interest his comments regarding his wife's and his choices and disagreements regarding how to raise their children.\n \n Now you mention it though it would seem beneficial to mate with someone religious, although conflict may arise... but yes I can see your line of reasoning.\n \n \n I don't believe choices like that are made. One can dupe oneself into believing that some such choice is made, but this is largely an illusion. One can proclaim to have eaten his last doughnut, but that doesn't make it so. These mental games are mostly a charade to preserve the ego. \n\n \n Yes, again when I talk about 'choice' it's a case of something to placate the ego rather than because you really *have a choice*. In this case I find people can be split into those who pursue 'contentment' (happiness, ignorance) and those who pursue 'truth' (which generally doesn't lead to contentment going by my anecdotal evidence).\n \n \n You do not know how another person feels contentment, much less a chimp. I would hazard a guess that chimps in the wild do not commit suicide at the same rates as humans, but perhaps it doesn't occur to them. It's really tough to say much definitively. Nonetheless our feelings (romantic as they may be) seem to jibe. \n\n \n Again, yes, agreed -- I may well be guilty of anthropomorphism.\n \n \nI do not see how my comments are undone even if the monk attains enlightenment. Humans that go along blindly with the crowd still seem to replicate (on the whole) better than those that don't. (A monk isn't going along with the crowd. He is probably duped, but in a way not very good for self-replication. That's an anomaly soon to be corrected by Darwin.)\n\n \n My comments were related to whether we could call the monk 'stupid' or not for not choosing to be succesful in the darwinistic sense.\n \n \n There is no proof that I need to put gas in my car in order that it work. There is no proof that the gas or car even exist. There is no proof of much of anything. What there is is evidence. I've given you a plausible story with supporting evidence (e.g., Caribbean slaves).

Why aren't kids born believing in god or disbelieving in god? For one simple fact: The truth is not a handy thing to have. Knowing what is true is not beneficial for replication. \n\n \n Yes, you're highlighting my clumsy use of words -- my apologies.\n \n I'd be interested to postulate on what a more 'evolved' religion in the darwinistic sense might one day 'look like' given the points you've raised in our previous discussion.",

Anyway, I agree with your comments although I'm slightly 'unsure' regarding the use of the word 'stupid' as you know from my previous comments. \n\n Stupidity: Believing whatever nonsense is spouted: Virgin sacrifices, burnt offerings, journeys to Mecca, chanting, eating crackers, discussing horseradish, whatever. \n \n \n \nI think that while not being religious would give hefty advantages it would also make the individual a pariah so I'd have to judge the relative merits on a case by case scenario. \n\n I don't think it takes much thought: One simply does not want to be an outcast.

I'm not saying that one \"should\" be stupid, based on some other set of criteria, as yet unspecified. I'm merely arguing that stupidity is best for self-replication. Whether you or some monk or somebody else \"should\" take any course of action is really not the issue. People are going to do whatever they are going to do. The fact that the monk finds enlightenment, the native dies with dignity and finds a better hunting ground in the beyond, or whatever is beside the point.

   "If the target is reproduction then conformity and emulation of the parents behaviour and 'values' provides (seemingly) the best 'starting point' for future success. \n\n Yes, my argument is not specifically about parents, but the environment (parents, society, etc.), whatever they are immersed in. I think this is pretty clear in cases where children have been raised by dogs, and thus act like them. My argument is that children conform to their environment, and that knowledge of the truth is counterproductive to replication. Why is it that kids are not built such that they either believe in sikhism or disbelieve in sikhism (and believe instead in something else)? Sikhism is either true or it is not true, but that does not seem like a handy piece of information to have. If you still resist in admitting that stupidity (the inability to distinguish sense from non-sense) is being selected for, please explain how all these conflicting religions can exist, each person \"knowing\" he is right, and that the other is wrong. Explain, in the absence of stupidity, how Hitler could convince all those people that they were a super race, destined to rule greater Europe for 1000 years. What Hitler said was: It is good for governments that people do not think for themselves. But that's what he said. What do you say?\n \n \nWell if the only target is reproduction once a 'good number' of females are impregnated what does it matter if you are killed? \n\n My point of saying that you might end up dead is that you'd be non-replicable (not that it was somehow objectionable). However, the correct goal is make more replicators (not merely babies). Likely your offspring will fare better if you're around to provide, teach, and protect. You don't want them dead, either. If you are merely \"choosing\" to be a rapist (it isn't genetic), you'll not be able to reliably pass down your mating strategy, unless you are around to teach it. Therefore the long term outlook for your strategy is dubious. \n \n \nOf course you'd have to way it up -- how many offspring you could father by raping carefully selected (hopefully radical 'pro-life') women before incarceration and/or death versus how many offspring you could father in a socially 'acceptable manner'. \n\n This certainly is a valid question, but it doesn't seem to work. Females have evolved such that they are not likely to become impregnated by hit-and-run. They are not fertile except for a couple of days a month, and even then their environment is extremely hostile to prospective little fertilizers. Women are more likely to become impregnated if they orgasm, and this is a doubtful occurrence if they are being raped. If you then take into account the day-after pill and abortion, this just doesn't seem like a winning strategy, especially since it has no long term advantage--unless you are driven to do it genetically and can actually pass it down, and for that you'd have to sire boys that also have your trait. \n \n A more clever fellow started a reproductive clinic and fertilized women with his own sperm. Still this is a one time blip and not a long-term advantage (i.e., his kids probably won't start their own clinics). He probably would have been better off with one hippy catholic (of course he could have done that in his spare time).\n \n \nIndeed I am male and I found the perfect candidate during the time I was studying for my A levels (16 to 18~19).

Foolishly, I have the romantic notion that the lack of romance would make life passable.

Subjugation of women in general is a very good thing: Keep 'em barefoot and pregnant, and definitely not in charge of their own reproductive \"choices\". An evolved religion is going to control its women; men, needless to say, don't need to be controlled. \n \n \nI noticed you haven't commented on my Genghis Khan 'exception to the proposed rule' example -- I think he shows that if the individual has 'power' enough that he becomes 'the authority' of the society that not having a religion could be of benefit to reproducing. \n\n I'm sorry: I didn't see it you bringing it forth as an objection (but as an aside).\n It's good to be king.

   "No I don't resist anymore ...\n\n Good. Where to now?\n \n \nrather when one describes the 'monk' from our examples I personally would clarify that in the context of Darwinism he is stupid. Now this doesn't mean I don't think there is a very strong argument for calling him simply 'stupid' it's just I find it too general a statement.\n\n \n I think I follow. I'm not quite sure that we have an argument, though. I don't recall saying the monk was stupid. I said: \"He is probably duped, but in a way not very good for self-replication.\" He may not be duped at all, and on his way to enlightenment. What are we arguing about? (Find the quote, so that I may retract it.)\n \n \nI do agree that being religious is being selected for. \n\n Well you can't be agreeing with me, because I don't think that (at least I'm not putting that forward), unless by religious you mean generally stupid (not being able to distinguish sense from nonsense). The whole idea is that the child swallows everything whether it is of a religious nature or not (lip-discs, neck rings, tattoos, cannibalism, head-hunting, eating dogs and cats, not eating dogs and cats, Santa, the Tooth Fairy, materialism, whatever). \n \n \nI can see why you class religion as being 'stupid' -- I tend to agree although I'd be tempted to replace 'religion' with 'blind faith'. \n\n I guess I haven't made myself clear. Religion (i.e., the plethora of religions) is evidence of stupidity (the inability to distinguish sense from non-sense). Religion isn't stupidity (that sentence doesn't even make sense to me). I tend to pick on religion, because it is such an easy mark, but I am not particularly trying to make a point about religion. Materialism, ascetism, fatalism, free-will-ism, capitalism, communism, nihilism, moralism, freudism, jungism, ...pick your ism...are other evidences of stupidity (people believing whatever they are exposed to). Why do you suppose that two supposedly intelligent people can't agree on what evidence seems to show? It isn't that they concede that an issue is murky; they maintain that they are right and the other guy is wrong. How is that possible? How is it possible that Spinoza says one thing and Kant says something else and Hume says a third thing and somebody else says something else, and each of these guys is some kind of great thinker? Have you not seen for yourself on these forums that (essentially) nobody ever convinces anybody of anything? How is this possible?\n \n \nHence careful research... \n\n Yes, research would be helpful, but do you suggest that the desire to do the research might be genetically driven? Again, if it is your \"choice\" to research, this will only get you a blip, not long-term benefits (unless you stick around to teach your kids to research). Keep in mind also that if your technique (either genetic or not) should ever take hold to any degree, Darwinistic (as well as social) forces may fight back. Ovulation cycles may become even more irregular, for example. The female orgasm may make itself even more elusive. The environment may become even more inhospitable.

   "\n I think I follow. I'm not quite sure that we have an argument, though. I don't recall saying the monk was stupid. I said: \"He is probably duped, but in a way not very good for self-replication.\" He may not be duped at all, and on his way to enlightenment. What are we arguing about? (Find the quote, so that I may retract it.)\n\n \n Erm.. I'm not all together sure any more. ;)\n \n \n Well you can't be agreeing with me, because I don't think that (at least I'm not putting that forward), unless by religious you mean generally stupid (not being able to distinguish sense from nonsense). The whole idea is that the child swallows everything whether it is of a religious nature or not (lip-discs, neck rings, tattoos, cannibalism, head-hunting, eating dogs and cats, not eating dogs and cats, Santa, the Tooth Fairy, materialism, whatever). \n\n \n I see so 'conformity without question' is being selected for?\n \n \n I guess I haven't made myself clear. Religion (i.e., the plethora of religions) is evidence of stupidity (the inability to distinguish sense from non-sense). Religion isn't stupidity (that sentence doesn't even make sense to me). I tend to pick on religion, because it is such an easy mark, but I am not particularly trying to make a point about religion. Materialism, ascetism, fatalism, free-will-ism, capitalism, communism, nihilism, moralism, freudism, jungism, ...pick your ism...are other evidences of stupidity (people believing whatever they are exposed to). Why do you suppose that two supposedly intelligent people can't agree on what evidence seems to show? It isn't that they concede that an issue is murky; they maintain that they are right and the other guy is wrong. How is that possible? How is it possible that Spinoza says one thing and Kant says something else and Hume says a third thing and somebody else says something else, and each of these guys is some kind of great thinker? Have you not seen for yourself on these forums that (essentially) nobody ever convinces anybody of anything? How is this possible? \n\n \n So stupidity is the inability to see past our 'conditioning'? That which we 'slurp up' to use your past expression?\n \n Well then all of us are highly stupid then it is only to what degree we are stupid which varies. Now I can see what you meant when you talked about 'stupidity' being selected for.\n \n \n Yes, research would be helpful, but do you suggest that the desire to do the research might be genetically driven? \n\n \n Well, I have no proof but then I have no proof to the contrary either. If it isn't genetic the plan/tactic will fail.\n \n \n Ovulation cycles may become even more irregular, for example. The female orgasm may make itself even more elusive. The environment may become even more inhospitable. Etc. \n\n \n Possibly, yes however if any tatctic becomes that popular then it will face the same problem.\n \n My study on the evolutionary 'battle of the sexes' is coming back to me now -- pitty so much I once knew gets 'covered up' with day-today trivialities.\n \n \n My mind did the same thing.

These very acts, part of the definition, necessity random results as described by quantum mechanics, it's consistent since we've introduced measurement. That is, if an event X is to be known, it must be observed (measured, etc.). If to be classified as random, we must know the result of X to see if it was not predicted. To know X requires us to interfere with the \"logic\" of the test, and interact with it. That is, X is no longer the X we thought it was, X is now affected, literally, by the measurment. But if we know what effect our measurement will have on the test, can we THEN predict the outcome? Once again, to know the effect of the measurement requires you measure it, and you once again introduce uncertainty.\n \n Questions like this push the necessity of people accepting that when we talk about particle A and particle B, they aren't neat little independant particles (as logic requires) but rather part of the fabric of the universe.

A wave acts entirely causally, deterministically, NOT randomly. However, for us to KNOW it's position and momentum, necessarily requires us to interfere, and introduce uncertainty.

This is bivalence turned on its head. The proposition is not \"A proof exists of FLT\", but FLT itself. You have the FLT being \"false\" one minute and \"true\" the next. FLT holds just as well before the proof as it does after, and therefore is just as true before as it is after. The issue is whether it holds, not whether it has been shown to hold. I already mentioned that you may want to look up Intuitionist Logic; it may suit you better if you want truths to be \"proven\". (But even there, they wouldn't claim FLT is false, just undetermined.)\n \n There is another problem with insisting on proof for something to be true: Where is the proof of the proof? Was FLT true following Wiles first proof of it, even though the proof was bogus? Then was FLT false once again when Wiles realized his mistake? Only then to be true again now? And what if Wiles current proof has an error, then is FLT false once more? Are you insisting on objective proof (the proof must actually be correct), but the proposition has no objective truth itself (it is not true unless there is objective proof)? This makes no sense to me. FLT holds (or doesn't hold) regardless of the existence of proof. \n \n Again: I don't insist on the existence of proof for a proposition to be true. I prefer to keep bivalence. A proposition is either true or it is false. Note again there is not one word there about anything being demonstrated.\n \n \n If T is a theorem that always results in a true answer, in a particular system, but does not necessarily have to be formally proven, then it was true since no one had, or has, show the result has non-zero integer solutions for x, y and z when n < 2. Thus, it always produced true answers, even before it was proven. \n \n Just because nobody had shown it to be false, doesn't make it true. Perhaps there are numbers, but just untried at the time, that make FLT false. FLT is true (or false) because it holds (or it doesn't hold), regardless of who does what. \n \n \n No \"needs\" associated with it. You cannot use classic logic to prove classic logic is correct, or the \"right one\", or anything else like that, why try? \n \n I'm not trying to prove classical logic. I'm saying that your insistence of proof is incompatible with classical logic. [In classical logic, a statement is either T (it holds) or it is F (it doesn't hold). There is no third truth state. Statements are not F until they are \"proven\" T. Where did you get that?] If you want to assume classical logic is correct for the moment and see where that leads, please do so. \n \n \n \n No, I already stated it has it's uses, so do other logics. Classic is the most prevelant, and arguably the most useful. \n \n So, are you willing to stick to classical logic for this discussion?\n \n \n \n Define T or F. It's meaningless without reference. Once you define it, we can answer. \n \n I'm only talking about number theoretic propositions in our system of mathematics now. If a proposition holds (in our system of mathematics) it is true.

The proposition does hold and it held just as nicely prior to it being proved as it did after. \n \n \n Yes, if in the inconsistent system of mathematics (if it involves number theory, for example), that is the definition of \"true\", then FLT was true, but not proven to be true, until later. And this notion of truth is relative to both the system and classical logic. \n \n \nYou seem to want \"truths\" to be proven. However, I do not see this as being part of classical logic.

This is bivalence turned on its head. The proposition is not \"A proof exists of FLT\", but FLT itself. You have the FLT being \"false\" one minute and \"true\" the next. FLT holds just as well before the proof as it does after, and therefore is just as true before as it is after. The issue is whether it holds, not whether it has been shown to hold. I already mentioned that you may want to look up Intuitionist Logic; it may suit you better if you want truths to be \"proven\".

   "If for reasons of usefulness or efficiency, sure. \n\n Good.\n \n \n \nHow do you know what statements can, and cannot be about? Based on what? Why is it not allowed? Sounds emotional to me. \n\n Self referential statements aren't allowed for the rather self-serving fact that allowing them causes problems. Bivalence demands that propositions be either T or F. Therefore, in order to preserve bivalence, such statements are excluded. [Note that anything you'd like to say about primitive statements is accommodated by meta-statements. For example: \"All primitive statements are false\" is a valid (but false) meta-statement. If you want to talk about meta-statements, then you'd use meta-meta-statements. Etc.] This is standard in logic; not my own device.\n \n \n\"hold\"? \"shown\"? \"Hold\" is a verb, I'm completely confused about how it's being used and why, please clarify. \n\n Hopefully this became clear later by the FLT example. FLT holds means: No whole numbers A, B, C, n exist such that A^n +B^n=C^n, for n<2. That is, no matter what whole numbers are picked (n<2), the left-hand side will not equal the right-hand side. This is just an affirmation of FLT. In other words, FLT holds means that FLT is true. This is circular, but all definitions are circular. Note that FLT holding has nothing to do with it being shown to hold. FMT was only shown to hold in 1995 (assuming Wiles' proof is valid), although FLT has held (was true) since it was first written down (as a property, it existed much earlier). Wiles gave a \"proof\" in 1995. This doesn't affect the actual truth of FLT in any way (it was already either T or F). The \"proof\" does, however, affect our perception of whether FMT is T or F. Wiles \"proof\" may be bogus (in fact, his first \"proof\" was bogus). We may think that FMT is T, but it may actually be F. \"Shown\" means that a valid proof* exists. For example, FMT being shown means that a valid proof of FLT exists. [I've purposely tried to keep this ideal for the moment. In the real world, we have \"proofs\" which may be valid or invalid. Therefore, it is not entirely clear, when faced with a \"proof\", whether a conjecture has actually been shown (in the ideal sense) or not. This real world uncertainty does not undermine bivalence. The conjecture is still either T or F-it hasn't changed. Whether the conjecture has been shown is also T or F.]\n \n *A valid proof (of a conjecture being true) consists of valid (logical) steps (within the assumed system) which lead from axioms of the system (or other previously proved results) to the conjecture under test. If valid steps lead from the conjecture to a contradiction of an axiom, then the conjecture is proven false. \n \n \nYes, if in the inconsistent system of mathematics (if it involves number theory, for example), ...\n\n Why is our system of mathematics inconsistent?\n \n \n...that is the definition of \"true\", then FLT was true, but not proven to be true, until later. And this notion of truth is relative to both the system and classical logic. \n\n You seem to want to hedge on what truth is. You agreed to stick to bivalence. If you have an alternate definition of truth (that is consistent with classical logic), please propose it. Agree or disagree-get off the fence. (Yes, classical logic and mathematics are being assumed.)\n \n \n... Again, I don't \"want\" anything with regards to truths, and again I not only defined truth/false for you with regards to reality (Justified via evidence/rational demonstration, NOT PROOF), I've never implied it either. \n\n I don't accept your definition of truth with regards to reality. If you don't want anything with regards to truth, why do you keep putting forth this definition? If it is all the same to you, why not put forth another definition? \n \n Anyway, I did not mean to imply anything with regards to what might be acceptable demonstration for you in reality, but only in regards to number theoretic propositions. Do you now accept that (given classical logic and our mathematics) number theoretic propositions can exist which are true and unprovable (G\u00f6del); that proof is not required for a number theoretic proposition to be true?\n \n \n You're not catching it all, read it again without the bias, it was a for instance, pushing you for a definition of your notion of \"truth\". \n\n I did catch the IF, eventually.\n \n \n  \"IF all T's must be mathematically proven via a defined axiomatic system, and Fermat's Last theorem upon declaration was not accompanied by such a written proof, it was indeed False, until proven true.\"\n I'm giving a for instance, and the proposition is true.\n IF for X to be termed T requires proof, and no proof is given, X is false until proven. I hope that's more clear. It's not my definition of truth, I've already given one (Reality), and asked for one for mathematics, which you have supplied, but still need to further define (hold/shown). \n\n All T's do not have to be proven. This notion is in violation of bivalence. Number theoretic propositions are either T or F. They don't flop back and forth from state to state, just because someone picks up a pencil, bushes his teeth, or has a smoke. Agreed?\n \n \n This elusive power of \"holding\" will be defined by you as requested, before I can comment. \n\n I've tried to define \"holds\" above. My comment was:\n \"Just because nobody had shown it to be false, doesn't make it true. Perhaps there are numbers, but just untried at the time, that make FLT false.

In order for there to be any hope of getting anywhere, it is necessary to back up to where our positions diverge. I'm still unsure where that is. My idea was to attempt to keep the environment as pristine as possible (number theoretic proposals), so that we may be able to discuss our positions without getting into unnecessary complications. Like a mathematical proof, I want to start out with axioms (premises), and move forward to conclusions. I think it is pointless to argue conclusions if we don't agree on the premises. \n I'm not \"requiring\" anything. If we can't agree on logic, then it is best to know that's where the stumbling block is. You supposedly wanted to adhere to classical logic for this discussion.

   "Were the two influences truly equal, the dog would be unable to choose. It seems to me likely that the brain has evolved ways to overcome such an unprofitable situation - for example, preferences being in a constant state of slight movement, such that any \"equality of desires\" is overcome with a moment's hesitation.\n \n Either this, or it is possible preferences are encoded in a ranked order, in which case it is not possible to have two things equally preferred, so long as they are distinguished from one another. Some psychological evidence I have seen appears to support this, and it would be a firm way of ensuring there were no inabilities to act generated, without the need for a constantly shifting preference scale.\n \n So there is a theoretical possibility, but even if it exists, it should only be of minor importance - a slight hesitation, not a lengthy freezing.\nMy point was to make an abstract theoretical position.

As I already said: \"I am doubtful that we will agree on what it means for something to be true.\" I doubt that we will ever get to whether something is random, so I really don't have much of a definitive plan in that regard. Admittedly, my primary interest is to address Truth, and randomness is a bit of a red herring. \n \n \nIf we define a system, and what T or F in that system is, and we agree upon it.....how do you propose to show it's incorrect relative to that system, if we adhere to the rules of the system and to logic? \n\n I have no plan to propose anything. You are on the hook to demonstrate something if it ever gets there. \n \n \nWhat is or is not, is certainly easily demonstrated within any sufficiently defined system where we reject recursiveness. \n\n I'm not following. Far from being easy, Godel says that it's impossible to demonstrate all truths.\n \n \nAlso, on a side note, I'm not familiar with any true statements in a given system which cannot be proven, except for those of the recursive kind which you reject. Are you? \n\n Apparently both the Axiom of Choice (AC) and the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) are un-decideable within Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) Set Theory. Both of these (or their negations) can be added to ZF as axioms forming a new set theory. In the new set theory, there will still be other propositions which are True and yet unprovable (Godel). There is no way to know (in general) whether these propositions are True or not. There is also no way to know (in general) whether they are unprovable. If one is found to be unprovable, it (or its negation) can just be added as an axiom. There are a whole host of suspects (beyond AC and CH) for un-decidability. For example, Riemann's Hypothesis has been tested for a huge number of values and seems to hold. Despite a $1M reward for a proof (offered in 2000), no proof has apparently been found. Another famous elusive little devil is whether there are an infinite number of twin primes (i.e., prime numbers that differ by 2, such as 5 and 7). There is no shortage of candidates. Here: I'll make one up. Consider any whole number (N) which is greater than 1. Step 1) If N is not divisible by 2 go to Step 2, otherwise divide N by 2, creating a new N. If N is now 1, you're done; otherwise go back to Step 1. 2) If N is not divisible by 3, go to Step 3, otherwise divide N by 3, creating a new N. If N is now 1, you're done; otherwise go back to Step 1. 3) Multiply N by 5 and add 1, creating a new N, then go back to Step 1. Proposition: For any whole number N greater than 1, a finite number of steps are needed to reduce N to 1. For example, 124986134 is reduced to 1 in 80 iterations. 723612063532 is reduced to 1 in 127 iterations. 62985623468125 is reduced to 1 in 290 iterations. According to you, what is or is not True is easily demonstrated. Okay, demonstrate it easily. \n \n I have no good reason to want to find issue with Godel, although I can see why you would.\n \n \nThen would it not also be true to say, given your rejection, that any true statement can be proven? \n\n I do not understand. What have I rejected: self referential statements? Yes: They have been rejected-they are not well formed. Again, this isn't my personal predilection, but an acceptance of the position taken by logicians and mathematicians historically. This rejection is to allow all well-formed statements to be T or F; it doesn't make them provable. Godel says that there are True (well-formed) statements that are unprovable.",

   "Toby,\n You're off an a goose chase, that's why it's difficult to understand what you're writing.\n \n\n I am? Please quote me: I have no idea what you are talking about.\n \n \nTo be clear:\n - I have never stated that I believe a formal proof is required for something to be. That would be absurd.\n \n\n I assume you meant to say: \"...for something to be [true].\"\n \n Excellent: Because proof /demonstration of any kind is not required for something to be True or False. I notice that you do not bother to quote me, nor to answer all of my points. I would like to think that you understood my point about the whether the sun revolved around the earth each day during the year 1,000,000 BC. It either did or it didn't. If it did revolve around the earth each day, then the proposition is True. I may have no good way of knowing definitively whether or not the proposition is True or False, but it must be True or False according to bivalence. \n \n \nBack to your definition:\n \n Your notion of \"holds\" seem to be analagous to:\n \n 1. Sufficient evidence (rigorous) \n\n No. Whether a proposition holds has nothing to do with evidence. It has to do with whether it is True. If I note that the sun rises, floats across the sky, sets, and comes up the next morning, over several 24 hour periods, I have demonstrated that the sun rotates about the earth once each day. Does that mean that the proposition that the sun rotates about the earth once each day is True? Not at all. It merely means that I believe that the proposition is True. The proposition is True if it is actually True. What has been demonstrated doesn't change the whether the proposition is True. Bivalence demands that the proposition be True or False before anybody provides any demonstration. Bivalence isn't going to sit around idly and wait for you to pick up a pencil. Bivalence doesn't care what you do, how confused you are, what you happen to believe or not believe. The proposition is True or it is False, and bivalence couldn't care less that you don't know whether the proposition is True or False. Bivalence doesn't care if you can never know. \n \n \n \nFrom mathworld:\n http://mathworld.wolfram.com/True.html\n True:\n A statement which is rigorously known to be correct. A statement which is not true is called false, although certain statements can be proved to be rigorously undecidable within the confines of a given set of assumptions and definitions.\n ================================\n \n\n This is not \"True\" according to bivalence. Bivalence demands that propositions are True or False. Bivalence cannot wait around for somebody to \"know\". We discussed Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT) previously. FLT was shown by Wiles to be True in 1995 or something. Was FLT True in 1994? Not was it known to be True, but was it True? Of course it was True. It HELD just as nicely in 1994 as it did in 1995. In 1994, bivalence demanded that FLT be True or False. So which was it? The \"True\" of bivalence concerns itself with whether the proposition is actually True, it does not give a hoot about what has or has not been \"demonstrated\", or what is \"known\". What is \"known\" is a concern for people; it is not a concern for bivalence.\n \n \n \nEither:\n \n 1. You require a formal proof (certainty) in a mathematical system to know if something is true (and invariably unprovable sentences are neither T nor F).\n \n or\n 2. You do not require a proof to know if something is T or F in a mathematical system.\n \n\n The definition of \"True\" has nothing to do with proof. You seem to want to talk about how to \"know\" whether a proposition is True. This is an interesting topic, but I really don't think you realize what it means for a proposition to be True. Why concern yourself with how to know whether a proposition is True until you can grasp what it means for the proposition to be True. \"Knowing\" is an epistemological issue. Here I'm merely trying to define True and False as you requested. After I define them, then you can go about showing me how we can know whether anything is random or not.\n \n Please stop injecting knowledge into this discussion about Truth. Truth has nothing to do with \"knowledge\". Bivalence simply cannot wait around for \"knowledge\" to happen. I gave you an example of whether N can be reduced to 1 in a finite number of iterations (see my previous post). Well, is the proposition (that it can be reduced) True or is it False? Bivalence demands that the proposition is already True or False; it isn't going to wait around for your analysis. As far as bivalence knows, you may never be able to figure whether or not it is True or False. Bivalence doesn't care one iota about you or your analysis. It has its own timetable to keep. Bivalence knows instantaneously whether any (number theoretic) proposition is True or False (according to PM). That you do not know instantaneously is not bivalence's concern. Bivalence is concerned with Truth of propositions, not your \"knowledge\" of Truth.\n \n \nNotice I'm not talking about what is or isn't, naturally any discussion of what is or isn't necessitates having knowledge of what is or isn't if we are to discuss it, which is exactly what's in question.\n \n\n You have asked for a definition of True and False. I have given it to you numerous times. You have agreed to bivalence. Bivalence demands that propositions be True or False. Bivalence is mute on the subject of knowledge. You can \"know\", you can \"not know\"; bivalence doesn't care. If you disagree with anything I say, please quote me, and state your objection. Otherwise just concede that once buy bivalence, you have bought a kind of Truth that has absolutely nothing to do with evidence, demonstration, proof, or knowledge.",

I suspect that falsifiability is inconsistent with bivalence. Perhaps the way out of this bind is to suggest that apparent scientific propositions are not the subject of science. I do not, at present, find this very satisfying. I worry, for one thing, about the parallelism with number theoretic propositions, and what justification (for falsifiability) can be given in physics that is not (usually) given in mathematics. Again, a lot is riding on the term \"in principle\". I worry also that we don't know what is falsifiable and what is not? We may end up in a position that whether something is a subject of science, is itself not a subject of science. I guess I will have to wait to see what falsifiability means.]",

I have a more step by step attempt at understanding your position, but this may be quicker. \"Nothing to do with\" is so broad it's just going to hang your definition up. \n\n What I'm saying is that the truth of a proposition has nothing to do with demonstration or evidence concerning that specific proposition. It would probably not be wrong (i.e., too broad as to be rendered invalid), however, if I wasn't talking about only demonstration or evidence of that specific proposition, but rather all demonstration and evidence. I gather I shall have to think about strengthening the definition to pertain to all demonstration, all evidence. \n \n \nGiven: A planet, let's call it Zeno exists.\n Let's assume to that the existence of Zeno is (of course) independent\n from anything we say about it, or our knowledge of it.\n \n Given: The planet Zeno is so far away that no human can yet detect it's\n existence with current technology and won't be able to for at least\n another 50 years.\n \n toby (present) wants to discuss truth or falsity with regards to\n \"reality\".\n Question: Can toby form a meaningful sentence that must be either true\n or false with regards to the planet Zeno? No. \n\n This is not quite right. I can state that the star Gizram (which can be seen) has a large planet orbiting it. [Actually, astronomers do guess that unknown planets do exist in a way similar to this.] I may not know to call the planet Zeno, but that really doesn't matter. I may also state such things as the planet has an atmosphere. Statements are possible (even if they are baseless), and IF such statements exist, then their truth is independent from their demonstration (and since I don't see why the truth would be dependent on another demonstration, that might as well be added). Any claim that no such statements can be made actually does nothing to invalidate the definition. If the premise is necessarily False (not my supposition, but yours), then the condition relying on the premise is necessarily True.\n \n \ntoby lives to be 120, obtains data on the planet Zeno, then says:\n Mach, either the planet Zeno was formed before the earth, or not before\n the earth, is a true statement. \n \n toby's statement of the planet Zeno presupposes knowledge of the existence of the planet Zeno, which obviously was acquired through evidence/observation. The statement, whether evaluated as true, false, following bivalence or not, is entirely dependent on the evidence of the planet's existence. \n\n Sorry. If the statement doesn't exist, then I am in no worry about the truth of the statement. The definition, once again, is about the truth of a statement, not the existence of the statement. The definition presupposes that a proposition exists. If no proposition exists, the definition can never be shown to be invalid. The definition doesn't care how statements come into existence. Statements do come into existence, but that is not demanded by the definition. Once statements do come into existence, the definition works fine. The definition doesn't claim that evidence is not needed for statements to come into existence. The definition is about the truth of statements that exist; it is mute on how the statements come into existence.\n \n \nTo discuss Zeno, then to reject that observation/evidence were required to form the definition that is used as a premise is the fallacy of stolen concepts (ala cult of objectivism leader Rand). \n\n I'm not sure I'm following you. Let's see if I can find a problem. Evidence is required for a proposition to be made (otherwise we'd be dead). The truth of the proposition has nothing to do with evidence (we'll assume the broadest possible interpretation). Therefore (perhaps), the truth of a proposition has nothing to do with the existence of the proposition. Although, seemingly an oddity, there doesn't appear to be a logical problem with this. If the proposition doesn't exist, then I don't have to worry about its truth. If the proposition exists, then there is evidence of something (in order to support life, or even construction of the proposition), but the truth of the proposition needn't be dependent upon it (and is not in fact). I'm sorry; I tried to find a problem. [That doesn't mean there isn't a logical problem, but I'm afraid the burden to find it may fall upon you.] I did look at an example of stolen concept, and my definition doesn't appear to violate it. Interestingly the site said: \"Rand's argument about stolen concepts is an important argument resting on her view about epistemological hierarchy. The hierarchical view invoked is that all of our knowledge rests on perception.\" Perhaps I should remind you that truth (of bivalence) has nothing to do with knowledge. As I already said: Knowledge is a subject of epistemology. We haven't gotten to knowledge, yet. We are still trying to agree on what truth is. Rand is not (evidently) saying that truth rests on perception, which is a MUCH stronger (and may I say a completely unsupportable) premise.\n \n \nYou must first acknowledge that all knowledge of what we term reality, is obtained through observation/evidence. (axioms not being technically knowledge, they are \"self-evident\", assumed as true because to deny them is not the choice we make). To not do so, then discuss it, is \"stealing\" prior assumptions that you then reject, statements which are not possible to make unless those prior assumptions are known. \n\n Once again: I'm not attempting to discuss knowledge. Does truth depend upon knowledge? Truth solely relies upon whatever axioms are in play. Knowledge may or may not exist. Truth doesn't care. If you want to discuss knowledge, please kindly wait until we decide on what truth means, unless you can show how truth depends on knowledge.\n \n It seems that the mistake in your argument is that anything is being denied. The definition doesn't say there is no evidence. The definition's claim is that the truth of the proposition is logically independent (\"doesn't have anything to do with\") from evidence. In some cases, where evidence (seemingly) needs to exist for the proposition to exist, the definition has no problem whatever of the proposition not existing. The definition is (at least) vacuously True in those cases, but True nonetheless. There simply is no denial in the definition. \n \n \nAny relevant statement in physics is the same:\n Newton's first law of motion states that \"An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.\"\n \n Where do these laws of newtonian physics come from?

There certainly are other examples, including theories of unseen dimensions. Propositions of things unseen are possible. \n \n \nIs this not the proper flow you are looking for? Or are you labeling the \"existence\" itself as \"truth\"?\n\n I'm not following: Existence as truth? Not at all. Statements may be about existence (for example the existence of an unknown planet), but statements may also be about things \"known\" (e.g., the sun is yellow).\n \n Let's try again: \n The truth of a proposition has nothing to with any demonstration, nothing to do with any evidence.\n \n Are you buying this?",

You can also use any concessions \"against\" me. If I don't concede, I tell you why, and you can argue against my reasoning. Is there some reason that you don't want to address everything that I say? If you can't break my argument, just admit it.\n \n \nEvidence of X is necessary to form a sentence about X.\n \n Therefore any true sentence and any false sentence about X, requires evidence of X. \n\n Yes (if you want to think that). But you are not saying that the truth of the proposition has anything to do with evidence. I already pointed this out previously: It is odd that the truth of the proposition doesn't depend on the existence of the proposition. But once again, instead of addressing what I write, you choose not to. As a result, I just repeat myself ad infinitum. Go back and address my claims regarding this oddity.\n \n \nScientists make guesses all the time about things based on experience, data collected through observation, etc. They don't, to my knowledge, regularly as part of a professional career in science, make claims about things that they have no evidence of. \n\n Yes, usually they don't (at least as categorical statements of truth), since the propositions would be baseless. I've already stated that, but you refused to recognize my statements. However, such statements are not only possible, but are actually integral to the scientific method. An astronomer can make a hypothesis: An earth-crossing asteroid is now at such and such a position. He can then go and look for such a satellite. His hypothesis is a proposition about something of which no evidence exists. Anyway, none of this has anything to do with the definition (i.e., the definition presumes that a proposition exists).\n \n \n That's faith based truths. God exists, etc. You have not given anything other than broad, hand waiving examples, I cannot question the astronomers you mention. \n\n Why not? You can look in the region they specify with the largest telescope, and see if you can see something. Perhaps you can see the planet. Perhaps you can see perturbations in the star. Perhaps you can launch a telescope into orbit and look for something. Perhaps you can launch a voyager to visit the region of space in question. \n However, even if none of this is fruitful, that does not mean that the planet being hypothesized doesn't exist, only that you could not collect evidence. If the proposition is well-formed, then it has a truth value, regardless of whether you can determine its truth value. Bivalence demands this. The existence of the planet may not have a place one way or the other in your knowledge base, but that does not mean that the planet does not exist in reality. We are not discussing knowledge. We are trying to agree on what truth is. Why are you asking whether or not you can question the astronomer?!?!? Does your ability to question the astronomer affect the truth? You once again seem to want to change the discussion into one regarding knowledge. Give up.\n \n \n If they are just pulling categorical statements out of their A** and saying \"All gh024gh42g have h0ghg\", they are irrational, I don't know what they are saying. \n\n The proposition needs to be well-formed in relation to whatever system is being assumed. \n \"All gh024gh42g have h0ghg\" has no meaning. \"An earth-crossing asteroid is now at such and such a position\" does have meaning (don't quibble-you know exactly what I mean-it can include whatever data are necessary to define the conditions of a hypothetical asteroid). \n Anyway, once again, this has nothing whatsoever to do with the definition. If you aren't going to object to the definition, please just accept it. Then you can debate knowledge if you like.\n \n \n If they say \"god exists\", I don't know what they are saying. \n\n God would need to be defined relative to whatever system is being agreed to. It may well be the case that no agreed system exists. If you can agree on the system, then somebody would need to define what god is in relation to the system. Obviously, to say that god is outside the system, does not make it a subject for the system to consider, and any proposition about god is not well-formed, and thus is disallowed (it needn't be True or False).\n \n \n If you say that I have a dog named MuchMacho, you too are irrational, if you are attempting to make claims about X, when you admittedly know nothing of X. \n\n You are only agreeing with me, okay? Irrational claims have truth values. You either do or do not have a dog named MuchMacho. You are not addressing the claim of the definition. If you can't address the definition, please just concede.\n \n \n \n -----------------\n \n Why is this false?\n \n Given arithemetic etc.\n P = 1\n Q = 2\n S: P+Q=4\n \n P+Q is false because it violates the rules of the system.\n \n Please list the rules of the system of the universe. \n\n I don't have to know the rules of the universe. The definition doesn't rely on me knowing all the rules of the universe. It relies upon bivalence, and that has already been accepted.\n \n \n Since we don't know if we can know all rules, we assume we cannot determine truths purely through premise/conclusion..that is, we are not omniscient. \n\n So what? The definition doesn't say anything about whether we can figure out any truths. Stick to the definition.\n \n \n Enter, o/e as the method for forming rules and premises, then declaring truths about reality, that are necessarily falsifiable precisely because we accept as truth, that we do not know all rules of the system. \n\n Once again, you seem to want to talk about knowledge. Give up. The definition doesn't have anything to do with declaring truths. The definition is about truth, which has nothing to do with declarations. \n \n \n \n \n ======================================\n But what are your premises. I cannot evaluate a logical statement unless you provide premises. \n\n What premises are you talking about? Why don't you try quoting me (all of me!) as I have asked you to do? \n \n \n Your avoidance of them might shed some light on why you are still making the same statements? Not that you are intentionally avoiding them. \n\n I might be intentionally avoiding them. Who knows.\n \n \n \n Premise: The sun exists\n S: I claim the sun exists.\n True\n \n Premise: The sun does not exist\n S: I claim the sun exists:\n False\n \n Don't wait until you have the premise figured out, you cannot. We accept it as true, either arbitrarily, or based on evidence. I'll let you decide which you prefer, faith or reason, both are attractive to be sure. \n\n I do not understand your point. Faith and reason are subjects of epistemology-knowledge. We haven't gotten to knowledge, yet. The sun either exists or doesn't exist (relative to our assumed universe--don't quibble). \n \n \n \n Yet another example of the absurdities that arise:\n \n I saw god.\n God either exists, or does not exist, is a true statement?\n \n\n Maybe or maybe not. As I already said: \"God would need to be defined relative to whatever system is being agreed to.\" If god is a smallish chunk of rock hurdling through our solar system on such a such a course, then the statement is well-formed and is either True or False. \n \n \n \n Q. What's god?\n \n The statement is rejected on the basis of being meaningless. It's equivalent to saying nothing. \n\n Yes: \"God would need to be defined relative to whatever system is being agreed to.\" \n \n \n Bivalence doesn't save the day and suddenly give meaning to meaningless symbols. Likewise, your notion of \"the sun exists or does not exist\", is equally illogical if we don't first define the words used. \n\n Yes.\n \n So, finally you will agree then:\n The truth of a proposition has nothing to with any demonstration, nothing to do with any evidence.",

   "\n It's true if it's \"actually\" true, or actually exists (in this case)....How is \"actually\" existing different from just saying \"existing?\" \n\n The word \"actually\" is supposed to distinguish things which actually are from those things which we think are. We can think that the sun revolves around the earth or that the earth is flat. We can look up into the sky and see a yellow ball (the hypothetical sun), but it might just be a reflection of the moon bouncing off the atmosphere in some sort of wacky way. If the \"sun\" is really a reflection of the moon, then there is no big gaseous ball up there, and the \"sun\" (as we think of it) actually doesn't exist. \n \n \nSo if it's based on our definition of existence, how did we form that definition for a sun, and for \"existence\"? Did the terms originate from information we obtained through senses? \n\n You can think that if you want to; it doesn't have anything to do with the definition. Suppose I say that the air in houses has nothing do with wood, stone, plastic, metal. Do you object? The air in houses might not exist as air in houses without wood, stone, plastic, metal, but that is immaterial. If air in houses doesn't exist, then the statement that \"air in houses has nothing to do with wood, stone, metal, plastic\" is vacuously true. (However, once again, that does not mean that a house cannot exist that requires wood, stone, plastic, metal. Perhaps a house of snow can be contructed.)\n \n \nNonsense.\n \n 1. A meaningful definition is not circular. It rests upon previous definitions, and at the root some things are assumed/accepted. Yet circular definitions are pointless.

My contention is that if you don't understand anything (i.e., the set being assumed is the empty set), then I can't define anything separate from everything else-definitions will be circular.

It has no bearing on the definition.\n \n \n Logically FLT was indeterminate, was it not? \n\n No. \"Indeterminate\" is not a valid truth state in the bivalent (classical) system we have accepted for this discussion. FLT was (presumably) True.\n \n \n given:\n - Not all true statements are provable within the system that they are defined in.\n - It is not always possible to know what true statements are not provable.\n - FLT was not proven, yet appeared to hold for every case tested.\n \n\n Yes, not all statements are provable. That doesn't mean that they aren't True or False. (Godel isn't saying they aren't True or False, just that it can't be shown.) In fact, FLT was provable, so it doesn't even fit the unprovability condition. Please try to stick to bivalence.\n \n \n Conclusion: FLT being true, or false, is logically indeterminate based on these accepted true premises. \n That is, whether or not FLT is true or false was unknown, and I think it was accepted as \"probably true but still unknown\" at the time, which was correct. \n\n Please try to stick to bivalence. FLT was either True or False in 1994. Face it.\n \n \n To claim it is true, in the time that you had the above premises, would be illogical? Are you suggesting that at that time, it would be logical, based on those premises, to state a conclusion as \"FLT is true\"? \n\n This is not about what people thought regarding FLT. This is about Truth, not knowledge. You seem to be repeatedly confusing the two. Please stick to discussing Truth.\n \n \n Just curious. I do know what you mean that it held, but if we form any sentence that reads \"FLT holds\" or \"FLT is true\", reasonably isn't it rejected because it's assumed these is a statement of knowledge, which we already see above is irrational to claim? \n\n If you accept bivalence, then you accept that \"FLT is holds\" (or \"FLT is true\"--same thing) is True or False. It doesn't matter that you don't know which. Once again, this is about truth, not knowledge. Truth (being accepted classically) can't sit around and wait for knowledge to occur-it needs to be instantaneously T or F. \n \n \n Whether it held or not I don't think, is something we can state in language as true, until our premises support our conclusion. In the FLT case, every time you test it \"holding\", that's evidence that it holds for that case. All evidence was consistent with the assumption \"FLT is true\", but it was still an assumption, supported by evidence. \n\n Once again, I'm making no claim whatever as to your knowledge of FLT being True. For all I know, Wiles' proof is wrong, and furthermore FLT is actually False. If a counterexample to FLT exists (Wiles' proof is bogus) and therefore FLT is False, then are still going to say that FLT is actually True, because there just happens to be a \"proof\" of it? In this case, FLT is False, and always has been. The Truth doesn't care about Wiles.\n \n ===========\n \n \n I'm also not sure why you think it's appropriate to write that a definition which, to be formed, required observation, has nothing to do with observation.
