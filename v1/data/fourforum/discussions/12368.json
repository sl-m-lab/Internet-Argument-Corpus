Provides that any person who owns a firearm in this State shall maintain a policy of liability insurance in the amount of at least $1,000,000 specifically covering any damages resulting from negligent or willful acts involving the use of such firearm while it is owned by such person.\n \n Provides that a person shall be deemed the owner of a firearm after the firearm is lost or stolen until such loss or theft is reported to the police department or sheriff of the jurisdiction in which the owner resides. \n \n Provides that the Department of State Police shall revoke and seize a Firearm Owner's Identification Card previously issued under this Act if the Department finds that the person to whom such card was issued possesses or acquires a firearm and does not submit evidence to the Department of State Police that he or she has been issued in his or her name a liability insurance policy in the amount of at least $1,000,000 specifically covering any damages resulting from negligent or willful acts involving the use of such firearm while it is owned by such person. \n \n Effective January 1, 2010.",

Citizen responsibility - through a variety of participatory activities - ensures that government remains accountable to the people.\n\n And here our Government says:\n  Rights and Responsibilities  \n Fundamental Rights\n \n This relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n \n More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.\n\n And here our Government recognizes: \n  Rule of Law: Fundamental Rights of Citizens Democracies exist to serve their people \n Democracies rest on the principle that government exists to serve the people.

Furthermore, given that you're not a fan of my reasoning anyway, how does this support your position without validating my own?\n \n \nThe fact that if somebody's willing to rob a bank, they're not gonna think twice about jaywalking to do so?\nNope. I said 'all crimes', not 'minimal crimes compared to serious ones'.\n \n \nFace facts. If you're selling crack cocaine and shooting people, then you really don't give a damn what the laws say, and you're not likely going to be concerned with obeying any of the rules. If such weren't the case then we would have high-speed police chases.\nStill not enough. We have high-speed chases because, compared to the alternatives, breaking a minor law like 'reckless driving' is irrelevant. That's simply a repetition of your earlier, flawed position - it doesn't include proof that people who commit 'minor' felonies are prepared to go on a shooting spree.\n \n \nI have every link that Tither has posted in response to Penfold's and Sinjin's idiotic claims and beliefs, a lot of which talk about the prolific availability of banned and prohibited weapons in the United Kingdom. And then there's the story about the arms factory that was recently broken up in Australia, with many, many palm-sized and operational pistols found on the property.\n\n And I have the internet. Would you mind being a little more specific? Normally I'd go and do your work for you, but Tither's posted a heck of a lot of links lately.\n \n If his links say anything like what you've been claiming, they aren't what I asked for. I asked for the change, not the end result on it's own. You're committing the same fallacy you tried regarding DC gun crime.\n \n \nHow does it limit the effects of gun crime? Are criminals going to suddenly throw away their arms because they can't scrape together the possible thousands of dollars necessary to pay their monthly premiums?\n \n Explain your statement.\nWho would the insurance money go to in the event of it being paid out? Presumably - the victims of the crime. That's reducing the (harmful) effects of crime, which is what I said - not reducing crime itself, which is what you seemed to have turned it into.\n \n \nA little prohibitive!? A million dollars is only a minor detail to you!? Who the #### can afford such an obscene amount current economic times?\n ...\n Well if you can't find what it would cost to have a one million dollar insurance policy for a car, don't try and tell us that such a rate would be acceptable for gun owners.\nUntil you find such a quote, neither of us have a clue what the rate would be.\n \n Off you go.\n \n \nFree enterprise maybe?\n \n There's a difference though. Prices on a gun depend on the MSRP, current market demand, what the dealer actually pays for the product, and how much markup they feel can actually be had while still getting the product sold.\nAnd, I'm assuming, this insurance is based on the damage that might be caused by such a gun.\n I suspect, also, that you would be complaining just as loud were there no minimum limit placed on insurance, just the requirement for some (cf: cars).\n \n \nThere's a difference though. If you can't afford something like a Kimber 1911, which is supposed to be one of the best, then you might consider a Hi-Point or a Ruger or something that would cost considerably less. But with this bill there are no options for those in the lower income tax bracket. The only two choices are pay the charged fees no matter how expensive they are, or don't be a gun owner at all.\n\n Sorry, did I say \"some people cannot afford a Kimber 1911\", or \"some people cannot afford a gun\".\n As far as I know, there is no 'free weaponry' system for the impoverished in the US.\n \n \nHow do you actually expect to force them to obtain coverage, when the vast majority of the guns they use don't even come from legal transactions and might be decades old?\n\n I don't know how many times I've asked you for evidence on this one, but I'm gonna ask once more. Proof?\n \n inpostedit: I got tired of asking. This states that of the sources of illegal guns, most come from straw purchases, the second most frequent method is illegal purchase from a licensed seller, and the third most frequent is someone acting as a middle man who obtains his weapons by one of the first two methods. In short, the vast majority of weapons used in crime have their source in a licensed dealer. Given that mandatory tracing of a gun from the instant it it sold allows more enforcible accountability on gun dealers, I can't see how you can argue against it.",

I asked for the change, not the end result on it's own. You're committing the same fallacy you tried regarding DC gun crime.\n\n \n I don't see how what you're asking is relevant. The legal market for firearms gets killed off in hopes of hindering criminals, and instead the criminals continue buying from the black market, importing them illegally, or making their weapons themselves.\n \n The only thing that more firearm restrictions will do is make it harder to regulate them in a legal manner. Germany has gone on record saying that it's now much easier to buy a weapon illegally in the country, than it is to buy one legally.\n \n \nWho would the insurance money go to in the event of it being paid out? Presumably - the victims of the crime. That's reducing the (harmful) effects of crime, which is what I said - not reducing crime itself, which is what you seemed to have turned it into.\n\n \n It's not going to matter any, because the person who shot and paralyzed you intentionally isn't likely to be the kind of person who has insurance. Ergo the whole scheme is useless; the ones who intentionally shoot and kill others aren't anymore likely to have insurance policies, than they are to only drive when they have a license.\n \n \nAnd, I'm assuming, this insurance is based on the damage that might be caused by such a gun.\n\n \n You're assuming wrong, just as one would when it comes to the ten round limit that so many people want on magazines; it's an arbitrarily decided number.\n \n \nSorry, did I say \"some people cannot afford a Kimber 1911\", or \"some people cannot afford a gun\".\n\n \n What I was trying to point out is that there are options available to almost any income bracket.\n \n \nI got tired of asking. This states that of the sources of illegal guns, most come from straw purchases, the second most frequent method is illegal purchase from a licensed seller, and the third most frequent is someone acting as a middle man who obtains his weapons by one of the first two methods. In short, the vast majority of weapons used in crime have their source in a licensed dealer. Given that mandatory tracing of a gun from the instant it it sold allows more enforcible accountability on gun dealers, I can't see how you can argue against it.\n\n \n We already have a system in place that is capable of tracing any recovered gun to its original source. As said before, anytime the police recover a firearm, all they have to do is call the ATF with the model and serial number, the ATF will call the manufacturer, the manufacturer will tell the ATF which store they shipped that particular gun to, the ATF will call the distributor, the distributor will look up their sales records, and report that information back to the ATF, who will relay it to the police.\n \n The system we have in place is sufficient for all tracing and tracking needs. We have absolutely no need for any other licensing or registration programs.",

However, most murderers only kill one person - 44% of murderers and 60% of those who commit manslaughter have no prior criminal convictions. How are they affected by current gun control?\n \n \nI don't see how what you're asking is relevant\n\n You don't see how statistics showing the effects of gun control on criminal availability are relevant to a discussion on how gun control affects criminal availability?\n I'm... not sure how to respond without sounding massively condescending, so I'll let your statement speak for itself.\n \n \nThe legal market for firearms gets killed off in hopes of hindering criminals, and instead the criminals continue buying from the black market, importing them illegally, or making their weapons themselves.\n\n However, the criminals do not get primarily them from 'the black market'. Their primary source is by legal means, their secondary source is by illegal means from a legal seller, and their tertiary source is getting a middle man to buy guns by either of the two first methods. That's hardly a 'black market'.\n \n For a black market to be unaffected by gun control, it must get it's weapons from an illegal source - that's theft or illegal/unlicensed manufacture. As all three of the main methods come from legal sources (and would be tracked all the way by registration), you don't have an argument here.\n \n \nThe only thing that more firearm restrictions will do is make it harder to regulate them in a legal manner. Germany has gone on record saying that it's now much easier to buy a weapon illegally in the country, than it is to buy one legally.\nHow is this meant to be a surprise? If something is criminalised for most of the population, it's always going to be easier for that part of the population to get the criminalised item illegally than legally, because they can't get it legally.

Bold added by me for accuracy - watch the video on the page if you don't believe me.\n \n \"The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is capable of doing a trace of a particular firearm because it will be identifiable by brand and serial number. They can go back to the manufacturer and say, \"When did you sell this numbered gun to the first person?\"Then they go to that distributor. Then they go to the dealer. Then they go to the other dealers that might have been involved until eventually they don't know perhaps, where the gun is and where it went because people in most states in this country can give guns to other people.

Because when an illegal arms factory pops up in a country with tight gun control, and they're in the process of manufacturing illegal weapons for distribution, I see that as a massive failure of the law to provide any protections to the people. To me that's the same as the criminals coming right out and saying \"#### you! We're gonna do what we want, when we want, and there's not a thing you can do about it!\".\n \n So you closed down every gun store in the country.

The thing is that the poverty line in America is approximately $10,000 a year for a single person, with about $3,500 added to that figure for each additional person. I don't know exactly how much of that money goes to food, bills and housing, but I do know that with the income my family makes we're right at the upper poverty level for a group our size, and we're doing well for ourselves; nobody is going hungry, nobody has to wear clothes that're far too small for them, we can even afford two cars. I've even managed to afford several nice firearms for myself despite our economic ranking. By firearms budget for this year along was over $700.\n \n So you're gonna have to excuse me for not believing that people in poverty can't afford to own a gun; especially when some military surplus outlets are selling genuine Mosin Nagants, for $40 for a carbine, or $70 for a rifle, and that's with all their accessories included.\n \n \nIn short, ATF trace data is largely useless because in order to investigate a gun, they have to follow it's trail from manufacturer, to distributor, to dealer, to other dealer, to purchaser, to second purchaser, to....\n\n \n Yes, that's investigative police work, it's their job to handle paperwork and follow leads.\n \n \nAn up-to-date firearm database would be massively more effective and usable, because a firearm could be instantly traced to it's current owner.\n\n \n And if somebody ballsy enough decides to act as a middle man and supply his licensed firearms to the criminal element and report them as stolen to take the suspicion off of him, the database has been defeated. In the end what you propose is no different than what we have now, it can only be used to find the last known and registered buyer, after that it's useless.\n \n \nA scheme such as this adds very large incentive for people to subscribe to such a database for general sales, because unless they do, they can be held responsible.\n\n \n And such a scheme would become too large to be effective.

   "NB:Response to Tither is at the end of this post.\n \nHow about those that intentionally shoot their victims, but don't kill them in the process? What's the available evidence for them?\n\n I'm guessing that would come under the heading 'assault', no? 44% of assaults are committed by people without a prior conviction.\n \n Not to sound tiresome, but the relevant figure was in precisely the same table as the other two figures I got, which I did link to. Is it really so hard to do your own research?\n \n You're onto 44% of murderers, 60% of manslaughter-ers and 44% of assaulters, now. To repeat my question, how were these people affected by current gun control?\n \n \nNo I don't see the relevance to me. Because when an illegal arms factory pops up in a country with tight gun control, and they're in the process of manufacturing illegal weapons for distribution, I see that as a massive failure of the law to provide any protections to the people. To me that's the same as the criminals coming right out and saying \"#### you! We're gonna do what we want, when we want, and there's not a thing you can do about it!\".\n\n Arms factories?\n Is this a story I should be familiar with? Link, please - I have no memory of it apart from a half-remembered claim of yours about a factory that turned out to be in China - and I still can't find even that after ten minutes of searching the forums.\n Google agrees with me - some factories in Thailand, India and China, but nothing in the US.\n \nSo you closed down every gun store in the country. So you managed to make it absolutely illegal to be in possession of a handgun. Big deal, the criminals have found a way around all of these hurdles, and the only ones faced with a shortage are the ones who weren't doing anything wrong to begin with.\nIs this in the US, or the UK? If it's in the US, this hasn't happened yet (DC aside, which we've exhausted already), so I assume you're talking hypothetically. This is (as far as I can see) nothing more than saying 'criminals would probably manage to get guns anyway, so why try to stop them?' If that is the case, then it is a very poor argument indeed - for example, why ban felons from owning guns in the first place? Why ban teenagers from buying alcohol or cigarettes?\n If you are talking about the UK, then you're also onto a loser. Gun crime in the UK is significantly less than in the US - numerically less, numerically less per capita, and (most significantly) a smaller proportion of total crime. That is to say; in the US, 51% of homicides are caused by handguns - 68% if all guns are included (source). In the UK, this falls to 9% for all firearms (source, page 49).\n \n Note also that your reply has in no way been an answer to my question. \n \n \nWe've already gone over how weapons are being imported illegally from outside the country. Do we have to rehash this point again?\n\n Yes - we said that this is definitely occurring in the UK and (to an unknown extent) probably also in the US. However, as mentioned before, that isn't the methods by which most of the US' criminals get their guns.\n \n \nIt doesn't?\n\n Nope.\n \n An analogy for those without basic maths skills. I have 4 red counters (guns brought for criminals by one of the three main methods), 95 green counters (legal guns, sold to 'honest citizens') and one black counter (the 'black market' guns), all in a bag. If I chose a random counter, there is a 1/20 chance that I will get a red/black counter - a gun used for a criminal purpose.\n \n Now I introduce counter control. I take away all of the green counters, because green counters are now banned and, as such, entirely removable. I can also take away some of the red counters, because the 'counter control' is still aimed at the legal sources, so supply to illegal purchasers is greatly reduced, if not wiped out altogether. The black counter is unaffected.\n \n I now have a 100% chance of getting a red/black counter. However, the number of red/black counters has not increased - just the chance that I will get one. Even if all of the red counters were removed, it would still be 'easier to get a red/black counter than it would be to get a green, because all the greens have gone.\n \n And yes - the black is still there, and that's unlikely to change.\n \n NB: No, proportions are not accurate. It's a nice enough analogy, though.\n NB2: Remember that ~50% of would-be criminals can still get the 'green counters' in the US at the moment (see the data on recidivism that I've been posting). That's an additional reason for gun control, even if you want to argue that cutting down on greens will not affect the number of reds.\n \n \nSo once again we're gonna wind up blaming somebody who was a victim of crime and making them pay for something they didn't do, and we're going to ignore the fact that there are illegal avenues for obtaining guns that the criminal element knows about and uses regularly.\n\n Have you even been reading what I've posted? Deliberate straw purchases are the main method by which criminals get guns.\n While some straw purchasers today are undoubtedly dupes, this is entirely changeable with the change to the law - if mandatory registration takes place.\n \n \nSo you're gonna have to excuse me for not believing that people in poverty can't afford to own a gun; especially when some military surplus outlets are selling genuine Mosin Nagants, for $40 for a carbine, or $70 for a rifle, and that's with all their accessories included.\n\n *shrug*\n I was just going on what you said, with the 'almost any'. I can't say I've ever tried to buy a cheap gun.\n \n \nYes, that's investigative police work, it's their job to handle paperwork and follow leads.\n\n That, without meaning offence, is the mindset of the children at school who refuse to pick up their own litter because \"the cleaners will pick it up, it's their job\". It strikes me as, at best, irresponsible.\n \n \nAnd if somebody ballsy enough decides to act as a middle man and supply his licensed firearms to the criminal element and report them as stolen to take the suspicion off of him, the database has been defeated. In the end what you propose is no different than what we have now, it can only be used to find the last known and registered buyer, after that it's useless.\nHow many guns do you think a 'middle man' such as this could pass on without arousing either suspicion or charges of massive negligence? It's hardly a feasible solution for many.\n \n \nAnd such a scheme would become too large to be effective. The larger the database, the more it costs, and the more cumbersome it is to use. Tither has already gone over this with the British gun registry.\n\n Only kinda true. Tither's link is outdated - the UK gun registry is now up, running and (presumably - that is, there hasn't been any negative press coverage) working well. It's very true that the UK registry has had far too many setbacks from conception to creation, but that's more a matter of government incompetence than a flaw in the original idea.\n \n \nI have a better suggestion. When we catch somebody who intentionally shoots people up for whatever reason, if we find them guilty then we stick them in work camps and make them work for slave labor to pay for the medical and insurance bills that their victims are faced with.\n\n Cruel and unusual? Humanitarian issues aside, I have no issue with forcing criminals to pay for their victim's care - but I tend to oppose corporeal punishment, as a rule. For one thing, I'm fairly sure it doesn't have that much effect.\n \n \nHaven't done much good in states like California or New York where you have to get a permit to own a gun; they've still got all kinds of firearms-related offenses going on.\nYou should have seen these coming from DC...\n Firstly, evidence?\n Secondly, relevant evidence? That is, evidence of negative impact of firearm control, not simply evidence that there is crime in cities.\n Thirdly, what prevents the same arguments that I used with regards to DC? That is; what prevents people from leaving the state, buying a gun and coming back in?\n \n \nI feel the need to ask the question: why is it that when it comes to the discussion of fighting crime, the subject of gun control laws always come up?\nIt does?\n I'm guessing... because this is a 'gun control' forum? You're going to have to clarify beyond that, I'm not sure what you're talking about.\n \n *****************************************\n \n EDIT:For Tither\n USDOJ on Recidivism, as all you could find was something on families, and a bunch of news reports.\n \n The report is a study of 272,111 inmates released in 1994.\n \n \nFor 56% of the 272,111, the prison sentence they were serving when released in 1994 was their first-ever prison sentence\nWithin three years, 46.9% of criminals had been reconvicted for another crime\n\n In short - of people committing felonies at any one time, just under half have prior records, whereas just over half can fully legally purchase a gun.",

Link, please - I have no memory of it apart from a half-remembered claim of yours about a factory that turned out to be in China - and I still can't find even that after ten minutes of searching the forums.\n\n \n Thousands of pistols seized in raids - www.smh.com.au\n \n \nThis is (as far as I can see) nothing more than saying 'criminals would probably manage to get guns anyway, so why try to stop them?' If that is the case, then it is a very poor argument indeed - for example, why ban felons from owning guns in the first place? Why ban teenagers from buying alcohol or cigarettes?\n\n \n No that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that the criminal element will still manage to get their guns, either by buying those already flowing in the black market or import them illegally, and the only ones who'll be without guns will be the people who weren't breaking the laws in the first place and have no intention of breaking them.\n \n There's no probably or might to this. We've seen stories in the news about the criminal element violating local or national prohibitions on weapons, drugs and booze to get what they want, it's stupid to believe a prohibition has the ability to hinder this.\n \n \nIf you are talking about the UK, then you're also onto a loser. Gun crime in the UK is significantly less than in the US - numerically less, numerically less per capita, and (most significantly) a smaller proportion of total crime. That is to say; in the US, 51% of homicides are caused by handguns - 68% if all guns are included (source). In the UK, this falls to 9% for all firearms (source, page 49).\n\n \n They were also much lower than the US even before the aftermath of 1997. It's a moot point. For it to be considered you'd need to show that crime rates have dropped in the UK since 1997, and are progressively less than they were in the pre-97 timeframe.\n \n \nYes - we said that this is definitely occurring in the UK and (to an unknown extent) probably also in the US. However, as mentioned before, that isn't the methods by which most of the US' criminals get their guns.\n\n \n It would be if other revenues were cut off, right?\n \n \nAn analogy for those without basic maths skills. I have 4 red counters (guns brought for criminals by one of the three main methods), 95 green counters (legal guns, sold to 'honest citizens') and one black counter (the 'black market' guns), all in a bag. If I chose a random counter, there is a 1/20 chance that I will get a red/black counter - a gun used for a criminal purpose.\n\n \n Look, this is my beef with the whole thing. We have all of these laws currently in place to govern the sale, the purchase, the ownership, the recording, and the tracking of firearms. We have lists of prohibited individuals by class, we have a database of people who are to be denied a sale, we have a system in place that tracks gun traffickers.\n \n Federal regulations state that if an FFL dealer sells two or more handguns to one individual in a five business day period, they have to send the buyer's information into the ATF. This is what the ATF uses and relies on to catch people who're buying guns to sell to the criminal element.\n \n Maybe what we need is an ATF reform bill that requires them to refocus their efforts on bulk purchasers rather than the dealers. Somebody buys two or three handguns in a week but their name doesn't show up after that for months or years at a time, it's safe to categorize them as a low probability threat. Somebody purchases 25 or 30 guns in a month all under a single name, he gets marked as a questionable threat level. If some of the guns bought by Mr. Bulk Purchaser turn up at a crime scene within a reasonably short amount of time after they were purchased, then you have enough suspicion to estimate that he's a gun trafficker, and you have all of his information so you know where to perform a sting operation.\n \n We have all of these laws in place currently, but they're not being used. I say that if we're to put any new laws into place, shouldn't we first prove beyond reasonable doubt that the current laws are insufficient and unsuitable for making a dent in the criminal element and putting violators away where they can't hurt anybody.\n \n Doesn't that sound fair and orderly? If the laws we have now won't work then show us so we can see for ourselves. Stop dropping various firearms charges anytime you bust somebody, grill them to the wall since the offenses are felonies, get tough and stop the soft shoe method.\n \n \nNow I introduce counter control. I take away all of the green counters, because green counters are now banned and, as such, entirely removable. I can also take away some of the red counters, because the 'counter control' is still aimed at the legal sources, so supply to illegal purchasers is greatly reduced, if not wiped out altogether. The black counter is unaffected.\n \n I now have a 100% chance of getting a red/black counter. However, the number of red/black counters has not increased - just the chance that I will get one. Even if all of the red counters were removed, it would still be 'easier to get a red/black counter than it would be to get a green, because all the greens have gone.\n \n And yes - the black is still there, and that's unlikely to change.\n\n \n Nice theory, but it doesn't take something into account. There's an unknown number of firearms that're still qualified as stolen or missing, unable to be found by the police currently, circulating in the illegal market. The number is estimated by some to be in the millions, if not tens of millions. Once in a while a shipment of stolen guns is found and impounded. But this doesn't always take them out of circulation. So far at least one police officer has been caught knowingly selling them back to known criminals, and I found at least one story some time ago of a police evidence storing facility being broken into and all of the guns inside being stolen again.\n \n \nHave you even been reading what I've posted? Deliberate straw purchases are the main method by which criminals get guns.\n While some straw purchasers today are undoubtedly dupes, this is entirely changeable with the change to the law - if mandatory registration takes place.\n\n \n Yes I've been reading what you've said, and I can't believe most of it. There's no evidence that mandatory registration is going to make any sort of difference for the better.\n \n \n*shrug*\n I was just going on what you said, with the 'almost any'. I can't say I've ever tried to buy a cheap gun.\n\n \n You haven't tried to buy a gun at all, cheap or expensive.\n \n \nThat, without meaning offence, is the mindset of the children at school who refuse to pick up their own litter because \"the cleaners will pick it up, it's their job\". It strikes me as, at best, irresponsible.\n\n \n A lot of people have said to leave the police work to the police, because they're trained to do it properly. So why should we have to do their work in this case?\n \n If you're alright with us doing the work of police then say so. But if that leads to a call for letting civilians be more forceful when it comes to confronting criminals who cross their path, remember how it all started. If you want us to police our own paperwork instead of leaving it to law enforcement who knows what they're doing, then let us handle other matters, like being armed in case of a violent confrontation occurring in our location.\n \n \nHow many guns do you think a 'middle man' such as this could pass on without arousing either suspicion or charges of massive negligence? It's hardly a feasible solution for many.\n\n \n If the middle man in question lived in a high crime neighborhood, it might be reasonable to assume quite a few. He could claim that he was robbed on the way back from the gun store or police station, or his house was broken into while he was gone, or that he was carjacked, or any number of stories. Some neighborhoods the police won't even go to because they're too dangerous, it's not unreasonable to assume that they'd choose not to investigate the report and just write it off instead.\n \n \nOnly kinda true. Tither's link is outdated - the UK gun registry is now up, running and (presumably - that is, there hasn't been any negative press coverage) working well. It's very true that the UK registry has had far too many setbacks from conception to creation, but that's more a matter of government incompetence than a flaw in the original idea.\n\n \n The Canadian gun registry isn't doing as well. It serves as an example of a system that's too large and cumbersome to be of any use.\n \n Or we could go with New York's ballistics database. It's cost millions in taxpayer dollars and hasn't proven to be a substantial crime fighting tool.\n \n \nCruel and unusual?\n\n \n Cruel and unusual is in the eye of the beholder. If the victim of the guilty party has been paralyzed and will spend the rest of their life in a wheelchair, I doubt they'd consider the punishment their shooter got to be cruel, unusual or unreasonable.\n \n \nHumanitarian issues aside, I have no issue with forcing criminals to pay for their victim's care - but I tend to oppose corporeal punishment, as a rule. For one thing, I'm fairly sure it doesn't have that much effect.\n\n \n Well if we can keep them in contained work camps, toiling away for long hours every day for years at a time, never getting a vacation or time off, being treated like black people in the decades and centuries before the equal rights movement, we could free up prison space and might even convince some of them to never get sent back again.\n \n If you were gonna spend the next five years of your life being a prisoner on a remote island and reduced to the status of 18th century slave and knowing the work conditions might kill you, for something like smoking dope, would you ever smoke dope again?\n \n \nFirstly, evidence?\n Secondly, relevant evidence? That is, evidence of negative impact of firearm control, not simply evidence that there is crime in cities.\n\n \n How about anytime Mayor Bloomberg goes on the news and talks about how New York doesn't have enough gun control and how they've gotta deal with armed criminals? How about Chicago last year saying it had a crime emergency because of all the violence and murder?\n \n The negative impact of gun control is when getting a gun requires a mountain of red tape and multiple trips to the police station to fill out forms and be fingerprinted and photographed, etc. and the civilian death toll still tops the criminal death toll. Innocent people get killed more often than those that would kill them. Doesn't sound fair or like a working system to me.\n \n \nThirdly, what prevents the same arguments that I used with regards to DC? That is; what prevents people from leaving the state, buying a gun and coming back in?\n\n \n Federal guidelines that state you can't buy a firearm out of state and take it back with you? \n \n You're the one saying we need laws, so I'm pointing out that we've got laws in place already. If you're arguing that the laws in place aren't working, how can we reasonably believe any other laws would be more effective?",

   "\n EDIT:For Tither\n USDOJ on Recidivism, as all you could find was something on families, and a bunch of news reports.\n \n The report is a study of 272,111 inmates released in 1994.\n \n For 56% of the 272,111, the prison sentence they were serving when released in 1994 was their first-ever prison sentence\n\n \n In short - of people committing felonies at any one time, just under half have prior records, whereas just over half can fully legally purchase a gun.\n\n \n \"First note the words \"1994 was their first-ever prison sentence\"\n \n Prison is different from the words previous criminal arrest record. \n \n Now note the 2004 USDOJ table of previous arrests. The numbers shown are for Without prior arrest in percentages.\n   USDOJ Felony Defendants 2004 \nWithout prior arrest in percentages.\n \n Violent offenses = 25% \n Murder = 17%\n\n And In 2006 the percentages were again different. 67%.\n   From the USDOJ Violent Felons in Large Urban Counties July 2006, NCJ 205289 \n\n * Seventy percent of violent felons had a prior arrest \n record, and 57% had at least one prior arrest for a \n felony. Sixty-seven percent of murderers and 73% of \n those convicted of robbery or assault had an arrest \n record.\n \n A BJS analysis of felony convictions in \n the 75 most populous counties found that a majority \n of those committing violent felonies had--\n * multiple prior arrests\n * at least 1 prior felony arrest\n * at least 1 prior conviction.\n \n .... Half of convicted murderers were younger than 25; \n .... Blacks (46%) comprised a higher \n percentage of murderers than Hispanics (27%) or \n whites (23%).\n \n ... Prior arrests\n \n An estimated 70% of violent felons in the 75 \n largest counties had been arrested previously. \n Seventy-three percent of those convicted of robbery \n or assault had an arrest record, as did 67% of \n murderers, and 53% of rapists. \n\n \n And I am certainly not going to let you blow off this 2004 report from the USDOJ. This study combined figures available and the averages are as shown as a combination of reliant data over the years. \n   Murder in Families \n Seventy-four percent of murder defendants had a prior criminal record of arrest\n or conviction for a crime. A substantial percentage of murder victims, 44%, also had a prior criminal record. \n\n Yes the report is about murder in families but the above quoted is talking about murder in general. The study then goes on to explore murder and their victims in families. \n   Murder in Families \n However, 19% of family murder victims had a prior record, compared to 51% of nonfamily murder victims. Also, 56% of family murder defendants, compared to 77% of other murder defendants, had a prior record.\n\n All of this agrees with the University of Tennessee Med school study done in 1991.\n  Study done by the University of Tennessee Med school \nLooking only to official criminal records, data over the past thirty years consistently show that the mythology of murderers as ordinary citizens does not hold true. Studies have found that approximately 75% of murderers have adult criminal records, and that murderers average a prior adult criminal career of six years, including four major adult felony arrests. These studies also found that when the murder occurred [a]bout 11% of murder arrestees [were] actually on pre-trial release--that is, they were awaiting trial for another offense. \n \n The fact that only 75% of murderers have adult crime records should not be misunderstood as implying that the remaining 25% of murderers are non-criminals. The reason over half of those 25% of murderers don't have adult records is that they are juveniles. Thus, by definition they cannot have an adult criminal record. Juvenile criminal records might well show these murderers to have extensive serious criminal records. \n\n The above data also agrees with this 2001 article and the number of violent crime statistics shown here.\n Gun Violence and Constitutional Issues \n The FBI statistics reveal that 75 percent of all violent crimes for any locality are committed by six percent of hardened criminals and repeat offenders.18 Violent crimes continue to be a problem in the inner cities with gangs involved in the drug trade.\n",

   "@Tither - yes, I know that there is a difference between the types of recidivism. However, most of the current legislation in the US for gun purchase requires no felony convictions for a sale, not that the purchaser has never been arrested (and not convicted) before. Arrest is not proof of guilt.\n \n This is why I'm looking at prior conviction rates - because those are the things which affect who can buy what, not prior arrests. If you look at your own DoJ report (which you kindly quoted) - \"44% also had a prior criminal record.\"\n \n That matches quite nicely with the figures I'm claiming.\n \n In short, all of our surveys are correct - but the figures you are focusing on are largely irrelevant when it comes to 'who can buy what'.

To answer it for you - those <50% of murderers could buy a gun entirely legally under the current US gun laws.\n Secondly - given that the current gun laws 'being judged' are those of the US as a whole, I would agree with you. They are hardly sufficient.\n \n \nThousands of pistols seized in raids - Sydney Morning Herald - Business & World News Australia | smh.com.au\nSo someone tried to set up a 'gun factory', and managed to make a whole 813 micro-guns before being shut down again? You'll have to excuse me for not considering that a 'massive failure of the law'. Also note the quote from the NSW Premier - \"all the guns up until now have been 100 per cent imported\".\n \n \nNo that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that the criminal element will still manage to get their guns, either by buying those already flowing in the black market or import them illegally, and the only ones who'll be without guns will be the people who weren't breaking the laws in the first place and have no intention of breaking them.\n \n There's no probably or might to this.

   " but the figures you are focusing on are largely irrelevant ...\n\n Just so you know, guncite is not a pro-gun site. It has always been totally accepted as credible. Certainly the University of Tennessee is, so you lose points for trying to suggest that the studies I link are somehow tainted. \n \n However, you are free to disregard whatever you feel like. The point we are making is, that the average citizen does not commit crimes, but especially murder. Hence gun control is not crime control. \n \n Neither does the increase in the number of firearms equal greater crime. In fact, the exact opposite is the reality.\n \n It has been accepted that before NICS background checks started, there are an   estimated 250 million guns in this country. \n \n Now enter the NICS background checks, which started processing background checks in Nov 1998   National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Section \n From the inception of the NICS on November 30, 1998, to December 31, 2006, a total of 72,097,650 transactions have been processed through the NICS.\n\n 72 million more transfers.

   "Firstly, that completely fails to answer the question. To answer it for you - those <50% of murderers could buy a gun entirely legally under the current US gun laws.\n\n \n Assuming that this is both factual and accurate....so what? People obtain guns before they have a criminal record? I don't see the problem with this. Yes it would be nice if we could keep those bent on wrongful acts from obtaining weaponry, but unless you're suggesting we implement an Orwellian system where a group of secret police are monitoring us through two way camera systems and studying our facial features and reading our body language to try and determine what we're thinking or what our intentions of, I don't see how it's possible, or why we should even be focusing on it. Until somebody does something wrong, you can't legally do anything about it.\n \n \nSecondly - given that the current gun laws 'being judged' are those of the US as a whole, I would agree with you. They are hardly sufficient.\n\n \n This doesn't even come close to addressing the point I originally made.

You'll have to excuse me for not considering that a 'massive failure of the law'. Also note the quote from the NSW Premier - \"all the guns up until now have been 100 per cent imported\".\n\n \n First, the article mentioned that the guns were in the process of being assembled and made ready for sale, suggesting that somebody is making them from parts, meaning that there has to be a factory somewhere in Australia. And second, the article mentioned thousands of pistols being seized, not mere hundreds.\n \n \nIn short (and to continue a metaphor) - you're claiming that because the black counter is still there, it's not worth trying to remove the red counters.\n\n \n In essence, yes. We can't touch the black market operation, so you're suggesting we tackle the legal market and blame that instead. But no matter what law you pass you're simply not going to be able to impound any of the possibly tens of millions already in criminal circulation, or the immeasurable number of illegal weapons that could be imported and sold through underground channels.\n \n Tackling the legal firearms revenues isn't going to address or inhibit the illegal channels that exist, nor is it sending the right message to anyone. So kindly stop with the tired old nonsense of \"I don't believe it's possible to affect the illicit arms trade, without first targeting the legal arms trade\" because it's a crock of beans. Why do we have all of these police in the country if we're not going to have them carrying out investigations to catch the ones that're responsible?\n \n \nDoesn't hold together, though - you have no evidence that criminal arms supply is unaffected by gun control. Last time I asked you for it you ignored my request.\n\n \n What evidence would you like? The links to the talk of the illegal arms trade going on in England where you can buy a prohibited firearm for as little as 50 pounds isn't enough? The article had pictures of captured illegal guns and talking about how prolific they are. What is it going to take to convince you about how real a problem this is?\n \n \nI've provided a reason why criminal gun availability in the UK is less than the US - because in the US, half of would-be criminals can still purchase a gun, and most of the others get theirs by straw purchase from licensed dealers. In the UK, this simply isn't possible, so that massively cuts availability.\n\n \n That's not a reason, that's a theory.\n \n I have a better theory as to why there's a supposed smaller availability of guns to criminals in the UK; because there are less people and obviously fewer guns were ever made or imported to begin with. There's no Second Amendment in Britain, there were no protections against the government passing one law after another after another, slowly and methodically making it harder and harder for anybody to get a gun, slowing down the source to a mere trickle, etc.\n \n \nIndeed. However, given that the vast majority of criminals would then change to such a tiny source, and availability drops\n\n \n This is assuming that the illegal supply will remain constant despite the increase in demand from a single source. This is a mistaken belief. If all the demand for illegal guns was switched to a single source, a single marketplace, then the arms dealers could import larger numbers of guns from their sources outside the country to meet with this demand. The more people want them, the more money they can make by buying in bulk. All you're gonna be doing is making these arms dealers richer and more powerful than they currently are, because you killed off all the competition.",

That the way criminal justice system works may explain this. You know as well as everyone here knows that not all convicts are convicted of their crimes in a court of law, there is such a thing as plea barganing. Most criminal cases are resolved through plea barganing than are resolved in the courts. Many DA's will drop some of the charges in an offence to give the defendant the incentive to enter a guilty plea. This usualy means going from a felony to a misdemeanor which will allow the defendant to still legaly qualify to purchase a firearm. The figure that I would like to see is how many of these murders were previously arrested on felony charges, it may be more telling to then see how many were plea barganed down. In my opinion I beleave that the courts and DA's could have prevented some of these murders by doing their job and not take the easy way out.

   "Second post, because I thought that the one above deserved one of it's own.\n \n \nJust so you know, guncite is not a pro-gun site. It has always been totally accepted as credible. Certainly the University of Tennessee is, so you lose points for trying to suggest that the studies I link are somehow tainted.\nApologies, then, if this is the case - I based that on a quick look at the GunCite home page, which contains the prominent line \"Until the Second Amendment is treated as normal constitutional law, this web site will always be under construction...\" That struck me as being fairly pro-gun. \n With regards to the figure itself - the UoT need not be pro-gun, just the members - if members they are, the article itself was originally published in Tenessee Law Review and I can find no mention of the UoT beyond the hint in the URL of the piece. The actual figure you linked me to was citation #280, and turns a '75% with an arrest record' (from the citation) into '75% with a criminal record' (from the article) - implying that 75% had been convicted, not merely arrested as the citation claims.\n That's why I discarded that figure. As a 'prior arrest' figure, it stands - but that wasn't what the article implied, nor was it the figure (of prior convictions) that I was focusing on.\n \n With that said, I'd like to add a minor (and totally off-topic) *shudder* at the notion that I might 'lose points'. While this is a serious debate forum, I'm here for the purpose of exchanging my ideas with others and having those ideas tested, not trying to 'score points' for my agenda. IMO, there would be a lot less of the passive- (or all-out-) aggressiveness if more people shared that approach. [/mini-rant]\n \n \nNeither does the increase in the number of firearms equal greater crime. In fact, the exact opposite is the reality.\n [snip]\n we must be doing something right!\nSomething, indeed. However, I remain dubious that is is your gun policies. Perhaps the fact that the US prison population is almost 1% of it's total population has something to do with it?\n Meh, speculation.\n \n \nAssuming that this is both factual and accurate....so what? People obtain guns before they have a criminal record? I don't see the problem with this. Yes it would be nice if we could keep those bent on wrongful acts from obtaining weaponry, but unless you're suggesting we implement an Orwellian system where a group of secret police are monitoring us through two way camera systems and studying our facial features and reading our body language to try and determine what we're thinking or what our intentions of, I don't see how it's possible, or why we should even be focusing on it. Until somebody does something wrong, you can't legally do anything about it.\nSurely I've explained repeatedly to you the methods by which you can seriously hinder those bend on wrongful acts from acquiring weapons legally? Notably - stop selling guns to those who cannot give a reason beyond 'self-defence' for the purchase.\n \n \nThis doesn't even come close to addressing the point I originally made. Nor do I remember even suggesting something like this.\n\n In that case, you've just been given a taste of your own medicine. Note that you are responding to the 'secondly' here, and the 'firstly' was a request for you to stay on-topic.\n \n I'm not sure where you got your 'point' from in the first place. As such, I answered it in the same context as you gave it - none whatsoever. If you want to add some actual context to the thing, please be my guest.\n \n \nIn essence, yes. We can't touch the black market operation, so you're suggesting we tackle the legal market and blame that instead. But no matter what law you pass you're simply not going to be able to impound any of the possibly tens of millions already in criminal circulation, or the immeasurable number of illegal weapons that could be imported and sold through underground channels.\n \n Tackling the legal firearms revenues isn't going to address or inhibit the illegal channels that exist, \nYes it is! I've already shown you evidence that the three main methods for criminal purchases are legal sources.\n \n \nnor is it sending the right message to anyone. So kindly stop with the tired old nonsense of \"I don't believe it's possible to affect the illicit arms trade, without first targeting the legal arms trade\" because it's a crock of beans. Why do we have all of these police in the country if we're not going to have them carrying out investigations to catch the ones that're responsible?\nAgain with the 'it's the cleaners job' mentality...\n \n \nFirst, the article mentioned that the guns were in the process of being assembled and made ready for sale, suggesting that somebody is making them from parts, meaning that there has to be a factory somewhere in Australia. And second, the article mentioned thousands of pistols being seized, not mere hundreds.\n\n Firstly - not at all. The parts could well have been imported in - it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier to smuggle in some abstract-looking bits of metal than something that clearly looks like a gun.\n Secondly - to quote the article. \"813 ready-made weapons... were seized\". They found the parts for \"Up to 2500 of the mini-guns\", but that's not the number of actual assembled guns. It looks like they got \"753 illegal firearms\" in the process as well, but they weren't the ones being created. Journalistic truth-bending at it's finest.\n \n \nThat's not a reason, that's a theory.\n\n It's possible you should go read the 'evolution vs creationism' forum a little before you start dismissively flinging words like 'theory' about :p.\n \n \nI have a better theory as to why there's a supposed smaller availability of guns to criminals in the UK; because there are less people and obviously fewer guns were ever made or imported to begin with. There's no Second Amendment in Britain, there were no protections against the government passing one law after another after another, slowly and methodically making it harder and harder for anybody to get a gun, slowing down the source to a mere trickle, etc.\nThat is what I'm advocating the US do, too. I'm not saying 'immediate gun control to this extreme level'. I'm advocating a slow process that cuts down on supply gradually. It has the same end state as immediately limiting supply, but far greater effects, because criminal gun availability must (obviously) lag behind legal gun availability, due to the number of illegal guns in circulation.\n \n \nWhat evidence would you like? The links to the talk of the illegal arms trade going on in England where you can buy a prohibited firearm for as little as 50 pounds isn't enough? The article had pictures of captured illegal guns and talking about how prolific they are. What is it going to take to convince you about how real a problem this is?\n\n You've repeatedly claimed this, and I've repeatedly responded in the same manner - it doesn't matter, because that just shows the availability now, not the change. I even gave you a long counter-related analogy!\n \n \nThis is assuming that the illegal supply will remain constant despite the increase in demand from a single source. This is a mistaken belief. If all the demand for illegal guns was switched to a single source, a single marketplace, then the arms dealers could import larger numbers of guns from their sources outside the country to meet with this demand. The more people want them, the more money they can make by buying in bulk. All you're gonna be doing is making these arms dealers richer and more powerful than they currently are, because you killed off all the competition.\n\n While this may be true, a larger operation is much much harder to hide - and illegal arms dealers are easier to shut down than legal arms dealers whose past sale history may be a little dubious, but unprovable corrupt.\n \n \nI know that I haven't been in this debate but had to make a comment to iangb this 50% bought their gun legaly. \nNot 'did buy', but 'could have brought'.\n \n I'm glad I finally found figures on it, TBH. I knew it had to be quite a large figure, as no-one is born with a criminal record, but to have <50% is quite impressive.\n \n \nThe figure that I would like to see is how many of these murders were previously arrested on felony charges,\n\n The figure is in the studies that myself and Tither have linked to - it is about 70-75% (I believe - I don't really have the time to go and recheck, sorry). I don't consider this figure to be entirely accurate because clearly not all arrestees are guilty of that which they are arrested for, and not all of the guilty ones need to cop a plea to get off a felony (lack of evidence etc).\n \n I fully agree that 'plea bargaining' results in travesties of justice - although I can't help but wonder how many of the criminals would still have been convicted had the not plead guilty to misdemeanour.\n \n With all of that said, though, even a figure of 75% means that 25% of criminals have never been arrested. When you have the crime rate that the US has, that's still a significant number of criminals.\n \n EDIT:\n \nNot it isn't. Jails are minimum security, used for housing people guilty of misdemeanor offenses that carry minor punishments. Prisons are high security facilities for housing people guilty of felony offenses, which carry much harsher penalties. And under federal laws, only those guilty of felony offenses that can earn you more than a year in prison are disqualified.\nThanks for the clarification.\n So, in other words, I still wasn't being misleading. Number of people who have never been to prison before indicates first-time felons, which indicates all those who can still buy a gun (before their current felony was committed).",

And since no reason must be given, denying firearms for self-defense will not come about!\n \n \nYes it is! I've already shown you evidence that the three main methods for criminal purchases are legal sources.\n\n \n No it isn't, get it through your foreign skull already! The legal market being killed off will do nothing, because the illegal market will continually remain. I've provided evidence of this repeatedly. I don't care if the criminals couldn't get their guns from legal revenues anymore, they would just continue to get them from illegal markets. There are far too many guns currently in the open market for any dealer shutdown scheme to actually have any sort of effect.\n \n What was the figure, 220 million firearms in private hands already? That's a lot that can be stolen and traded and trafficked. Explain how those won't be available to criminals if dealers are shut down.\n \n \nAgain with the 'it's the cleaners job' mentality...\n\n \n So then why have the police if we're not going to use them?\n \n How about this: from now on if we catch anyone who's broken into our home illegally, we'll detain them, charge them, find them guilty, and then execute them ourselves, showing how we have absolutely no need for the police or the courts or the jails, because we're capable of handling any and all matters on our own, the way it was done back in the 1800s. \n \n After all you're the one who's saying that we should be charged with doing the duties of the officials with all the training and resources, so why not just expand that theory of practice to cover all angles and cut out the middle man. If we do the work of the authorities ourselves and put them out of work we'll never have to worry about repeat offenders, overcrowded prisons, plea bargains going to the wrong people, and we'll even stabilize the economy because of all the excess spending that'll be stopped.\n \n Leave the police work to the actual police. They have the training, the resources, and the knowledge of what they're doing. The whole \"do it yourself\" mentality, if implemented, will have to eventually be expanded to cover all areas that're tended to by other people, and you don't want that going on.\n \n \nSecondly - to quote the article. \"813 ready-made weapons... were seized\".

I even gave you a long counter-related analogy!\n\n \n Are you saying that guns later became illegally available after the legal acquisition was banned and done away with, that it's not important because gun access was stopped once the ban was put in place?\n \n I don't get what you're saying, all I know is that it makes absolutely no sense. Guns were banned, criminals flipped the legislators off and have completely sidestepped the issue and continue to get access to guns at their leisure, without a care for what the laws say. The only ones who can't get guns are the people who're routinely victimized by the criminal element. That is nothing more than pure and undeniable failure no matter how you're trying to pass it off!\n \n What part of \"the criminals are still armed even though regular people can no longer do the same\" isn't registering as a failure of the laws with you?\n \n \nWhile this may be true, a larger operation is much much harder to hide - and illegal arms dealers are easier to shut down than legal arms dealers whose past sale history may be a little dubious, but unprovable corrupt.\n\n \n Again, nothing more than theory.

   "Why are we still going over this?\n \n\n I was just clearing it up. But also because I think you are under a misconception. First, it shows that gun owners are not the murders and criminals. Those who hat the 2nd Amendment want to use crime and murder rates to put more limits on the law-abiding gun owners, even when they are near historic lows. \n \n Second, if you are a drug user you are prohibited from owning a gun. Third, if you have ever had an order of protection against you you cannot purchase a gun. Fourth, if you have ever been convicted of some violent crime you are prohibited. All of these things can and often are handled by jail terms on County or city jails. \n \n Next. It is a great indicator of who is likely to be trouble makers in the future. Instead of doing gun control, responsible people should be proactive to stop them from even worse crimes. \n \n Show me which of these gun control will solve.   Crime factors from the FBI website \nHistorically, the causes and origins of crime have been the subjects of investigation by many disciplines. Some factors that are known to affect the volume and type of crime occurring from place to place are:\n \n \u00b7 Population density and degree of urbanization. \n \u00b7 Variations in composition of the population, particularly youth concentration. \n \u00b7 Stability of population with respect to residents' mobility, commuting patterns, and transient factors. \n \u00b7 Modes of transportation and highway system. \n \u00b7 Economic conditions, including median income, poverty level, and job availability. \n \u00b7 Cultural factors and educational, recreational, and religious characteristics. \n \u00b7 Family conditions with respect to divorce and family cohesiveness. \n \u00b7 Climate. \n \u00b7 Effective strength of law enforcement agencies. \n \u00b7 Administrative and investigative emphases of law enforcement. \n \u00b7 Policies of other components of the criminal justice system (i.e., prosecutorial, judicial, correctional, and probational). \n \u00b7 Citizens' attitudes toward crime. \n \u00b7 Crime reporting practices of the citizenry. \n\n So one would wonder when they are going to learn?

I was there when my father had to turn in his Colt 1903 pistol so it could be cut in half with a power saw.\n \n Then there's the issue of just how big and how unreliable a nationwide registration system would be. Canada is getting ready to kill their registry off once and for all because it's cost too much and given back nothing in its entire existence. The same thing with New York's ballistics database. In fact I've never seen even one news article claiming that any sort of registration database has played a vital role in solving any sort of crime. Surely if they were working we'd hear about one case or another that was solved because they were a registration system to check.\n \n \nI don't see this going anywhere, to be honest. I can see the reasoning for reducing criminal gun supply by a significant amount, you can't. There's only so many times I can come up with novel counter-metaphors.\n \n \n Criminal gun supply! But you haven't talked about the criminal supply of guns even once, all you've talked about is the legal firearms market and have tried to say that they're both the same, or that they're directly related and connected to each other, and that without one the other can't possibly hope to survive. But the illegal arms trade in Britain has proven you wrong. Criminals are still buying guns freely in the good ol' UK without hassle, shopping from underground vendors, having their pick of foreign-made weaponry, regardless of the fact that the legal arms market has just about been completely destroyed.\n \n \nFirstly, you're making an excellent argument against the vigilantism that I've heard advocated by some around these parts.\n\n \n And you're making an excellent argument in favor of vigilantism. If you want us to do the work of the police for them, then let us handle all of the other matters as well. If we should carry out the investigations then let us make the arrests and interrogations and extract confessions from the suspects.\n \n \nSecondly, I'd rather the police's job actually involved catching criminals, rather than chasing paperwork trails. The police don't fill in my tax returns for me, they pay attention when I don't fill them in myself.\n\n \n Again, why should we be required to do the work of the police for them? I don't care if it sounds childish, it's their job to worry about these things, not ours. They investigate the crimes, they catch the criminals. Do you know how many times the police raid the wrong house because of faulty information from a bad source? Imagine that on a larger scale because of citizen incompetence. \n \n A lot of people could get killed because of faulty information because we don't know how to do the job of the police for them the right way. So unless you're suggesting a nationwide citizen education program that'll teach everybody to do the jobs of the police as thoroughly and efficiently as they do it themselves, and provide it free of charge, I don't see any way what you're suggesting actually be possible. And what's worse, once everybody knows how to do it, those with bad intentions might be able to better carry out crimes and be less likely to get caught.\n \n \nIt's the same with guns - if each person had to take the five minutes to register their gun themselves,\n\n \n Five minutes? Where do you get this \"five minutes\" ####, as if it actually took such a short amount of time to register a gun and get it entered into the system?\n \n \nit would save massive amounts of time in the long run.\n\n \n And just how exactly would it do that?\n \n You started it, you finish it. Explain in detail how requiring private citizens to register their firearms, would save large amounts of time when it comes to catching criminals and solving crimes and all that other ####. How would it be anymore efficient than the system that's already in place? How would it shave time off of an official investigation?\n \n \nWith the 'litter' mentality - either you can leave the cleaner to pick up your crisps, or you can pick 'em up yourself and give the cleaner time to actually clean the windows.\n\n \n And if it's found that our actions compromised official police business and now the charges against an individual have to be dropped despite all of the evidence?\n \n \nLike I said, 'journalistic truth-bending at it's finest'. The parts for thousands of the manufactured pistols were seized, and technically over a thousand guns were seized - but only ~800 of those were the manufactured ones, the rest were regular guns.\n\n \n So the papers shouldn't be heavily trusted and relied upon because it might all be lies motivated by somebody's personal agenda? Then that would mean all the news report about America's crime problem being out of control might not be trustworthy either.\n \n How about this instead: http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/gun-blitz-launched/2007/08/11/1186530674425.html 20,000 illegal guns seized in a single year.\n \n \nFair. It's still something, though.\n\n \n So's an ant hill. But an ant hill being something doesn't make it worth our time.\n \n \n...because you've read my post on 'quality of life' and decided that it's better to base your laws on logical reasoning rather than a scriptural Constitution?\n\n \n We tried that back in Britain, it didn't work for us. We prefer having a Constitution that's still observed in this day and age.\n \n \nNo? Well, it's why I would do it. If you have something against it, I'd love to see some actual responses to that post of mine.\n\n \n Do you have any protections against government interference? Any way at all to level grievances against them, take the matter to court and have it ruled as violating human and civil rights, and thus getting it stricken from the books and the measure outlawed from further attempts?\n \n \nWhut? No, I'm saying that because the criminal market is mainly supplied by the legal market, it makes sense to slowly reduce the legal market so that there isn't a period when the pro-gun fear of 'only criminals have guns' is dominant.\n\n \n Doesn't work. Those who run the black market aren't stupid people. If they suspect that a tapering off scheme is in the works then they could just slowly taper up the illegal importations to make up the difference.\n \n The supply of Arms in America isn't going to remain static, the overall production level isn't going to stop and leave us with only so many guns total. The number continues to grow and fluctuate every single day. The number of guns coming into this country continues to grow based on demand. For what you suggest be possible then the number of guns would have to stop growing and actually shrink, with demand continuing to skyrocket. But that isn't happening, and it's not going to happen. \n \n \nYou're saying that a bigger organisation is easier to hide? I'd label that as more speculative than mine, personally...\n\n \n Why not? Countless tons (not pounds, tons) of cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs are smuggled into this country every year, from as close as Mexico to as far away as Thailand. The feds can't stop these imports, at best they can only apprehend the dealers and distributors after the fact when they're peddling it. They might get lucky and stop a shipment once in a while, but the majority of them are getting through to those who ordered them.\n \n The same goes for alcohol during Prohibition. The proliferation and supply of illegal booze was so great that there were hundreds of thousands of speakeasies opened to meet the demand for alcoholic beverages; a bare minimum of 30,000 in New York City alone. The feds obviously weren't able to do much at all if there was enough booze flowing to keep all of these gin joints open during a time when all liquor was prohibited.",

   "I'm unaware of exactly how Bryan would phrase his answer. But to me the mandating the people keep their arms locked up and inaccessible, thus unusable, is highly unconstitutional; like saying the people have freedom of speech, but they're forbidden by law from talking in public or posting on a blog. \n \n This belief of mine is further emboldened by the Heller ruling:\n \n \n \"3. The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District&#8217;s total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of &#8220;arms&#8221; that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition&#8212;in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute&#8212;would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional.\"\n --DC v Heller, page 2-3.\n \n \"We turn finally to the law at issue here.

The handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of &#8220;arms&#8221; that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose. The prohibition extends, moreover, to the home, where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute. Under any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to enumerated constitutional rights, banning from the home &#8220;the most preferred firearm in the nation to &#8216;keep&#8217; and use for protection of one&#8217;s home and family,&#8221; 478 F. 3d, at 400, would fail constitutional muster.\"\n --DC v Heller, page 59-60.",

   "I believe that if a safe storage law required you to \"disarm\" a gun in such a manner that it could not be immediately used in an emergency for self defense then the law would be an unconstitutional infringement on the 2nd. A. protected right of self-defense. \n \n As has been already noted by someone else, this is the boundary Heller established for safe storage laws. DC required that every firearm be kept inoperable by either trigger lock or disassembly. Heller ruled that this requirement rendered the weapon impossible to use for self defense-and therefore unconstitutional.\n \n When arguing Heller, DC anticipated that self-defense was going to be recognized as a core right protected by the 2nd. A. DC attempted to salvage its safe storage law by urging SCOTUS to apply an exception to its safe storage law for the purpose of self-defense (SCOTUS noted the law itself provided no such exception, and SCOTUS wisely declined the invitation to become a super-legislature and rewrite DC's law):\n \n We must also address the District's requirement (as applied to respondent's handgun) that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times. This makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. The District argues that we should interpret this element of the statute to contain an exception for self-defense. See Brief for Petitioners 56-57. But we think that is precluded by the unequivocal text, and by the presence of certain other enumerated exceptions: \"Except for law enforcement personnel . . ., each registrant shall keep any firearm in his possession unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device unless such firearm is kept at his place of business, or while being used for lawful recreational purposes within the District of Columbia. \n District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 58 (2008) (bold emphasis added by Bryan)\n \n Does this mean that a safe storage law like DC's which also has a workable exception for self-defense could be constitutional? I think so. \n \n Now for some personal philosophy....I believe safe storage is always the responsibility of, and should remain in the discretion of, the owner/possessor-so long as the storage option chosen does not endanger someone in the home, like for example a small child. I believe the extraordinarily low rate of accidental shootings tells us that big brother is not required to pass a statute to tell us how to best store our property safely. Additionally, firearm owners are not free from liability for grossly negligent storage just because a firearm-specific safe storage law does not exist. In Va. you can be prosecuted under the general child endangerment statute if you leave a loaded firearm lying around for young and curious hands to play with-the same as if you endanger a child by driving them around while drunk, or leaving an infant alone to drown in a bathtub because it was more important to see Oprah interview Tom Cruise. I suspect similar child endangerment laws exist in other states which could apply to negligent storage of firearms. Having said this, however, a safe storage law designed to protect those in the home would be constitutional so long as the requirement does not prohibit the homeowner from being able to use the firearm in an emergency for self-defense. \n \n And then there is the issue of mandatory anti-theft laws. I believe the same constitutional boundary applies for laws designed to prevent firearm theft during burglaries. So long as it does not prevent the firearm from being used in self-defense, then the law would be constitutional. I do not agree with the policy behind an anti-theft safe storage law, however. I do not believe we should punish the innocent homeowner with the cost of complying with a law passed under the specious pretext that he too could be the next burglary victim.",

Whether District of Columbia v. Heller will be a boon for the National Rifle Association and its allies isn't clear yet because few places have gun laws as restrictive as the one that the court struck down. But Heller also left some room for gun opponents to make a new case before state legislatures.\n \n Brian Malte, director of state legislation for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, believes Heller will actually help the cause of gun control. The reason: Now that the Court has said guns can't be banned entirely, the NRA can't cast milder restrictions on gun ownership, such as safe-storage laws, as secret steps toward government taking people's guns away. \"A lot of times they were able to scare legislators,\" Malte says. \"Now, there is no more slippery slope.\"\n \n What's more, the NRA may be a victim of its own legislative success. Earlier this decade, the NRA persuaded virtually every legislature in the country to permit gun owners to carry concealed firearms &#8212; only Illinois and Wisconsin still completely forbid concealed guns. Now, the NRA has moved on to other issues that face longer odds, such as allowing guns on college campuses.\n \n Both of those factors explain why, for the first time in years, gun-control advocates feel they're on offense in state legislatures. They're pushing for expanded background checks for gun buyers and for \"microstamping\" of firearms &#8212; technology that makes it possible to identify the gun that fired a bullet.\"\n http://www.governing.com/articles/0901issues.htm",

If they hadn't been so bad at wiring the timers, the propane bombs they set in the cafeteria would have wiped out 600 people. After those bombs went off, they planned to gun down fleeing survivors. An explosive third act would follow, when their cars, packed with still more bombs, would rip through still more crowds, presumably of survivors, rescue workers, and reporters. The climax would be captured on live television. It wasn't just \"fame\" they were after-Agent Fuselier bristles at that trivializing term-they were gunning for devastating infamy on the historical scale of an Attila the Hun.

   "Well, I use a safe to hold lots of property, and this includes guns that I do not rely upon for self-defense. I do so because I feel it deters theft and also protects my guns, my papers, and my other valuables from fire damage. I think it is a good idea to have one if you can afford it, and I recommend it to everyone. But, it is one thing for me to say you should-and it is quite another for the government to say you must. \n \n I'm just going to have to agree to disagree on this issue Sinjin. An anti-theft law runs counter to my understanding of a core principle of our system of criminal justice-we do not punish the innocent for the crimes of the guilty. An anti-theft storage law threatens to turn burglary victims into criminals. Such a law would serve to deter the reporting of a burglary by persons who did not have their guns stored in accordance with the wishes of government. For them, the law would provide an incentive to ignore the criminal justice system and instead try to recover their property by means of vigilante \"street justice.\" A law which encourages this is just not good policy in my opinion.\n \n In my opinion laws mandating reporting of gun thefts are also ill advised. Such a law also threatens to criminalize the burglary victim. The only purpose I can see for this policy goal is a belief that it would increase the number of immediate reports of burglaries and thereby aid in the recovery of stolen firearms. But in my experience I just do not see a problem with guns not being reported stolen from homes. In my experience homeowners report all property stolen as soon as they realize it. Guns are no exception. Guns are just like expensive jewelry and high-end electronics-they have tremendous value. Homeowners either want their guns back or someone to pay for the value of the loss. Many home insurance policies require a report to the police before stolen guns will be covered. A court will not order restitution for property which was not reported stolen, and I have never yet met a homeowner who didn't want someone else, be it the insurance company or the convicted burglar, to pay for the loss when they go to court. In my experience home burglaries are already nearly always reported within minutes of their discovery-and unless a known suspect is developed quickly the guns are rarely is ever recovered. I do not see how a mandatory reporting law would increase the percentage of immediate burglary reports or the percentage of recovered firearms. Finally, there already exists a tremendous incentive for reporting a stolen gun. Even in cases where the gun is not immediately recovered, if it is found three years later hidden under a bed in a crack house raid then law enforcement is obligated to return the gun back to the one who reported it stolen. Stolen guns are entered into NCIC, and I have seen guns returned to owners that are recovered years later in other states. \n \n Now are there cases of guns being stolen in burglaries which go unreported? Yes. These cases almost always involve guns held by persons who can't lawfully have them in the first place. For these people (felons, etc), the fear of being prosecuted for having the gun in the first place deters them from making a burglary report ( it is similar to the fear an otherwise innocent homeowner would have of being prosecuted for reporting a stolen gun which he did not have secured in a manner approved by an anti-theft storage law). These individuals are the ones who are most likely to try instead to get restitution for their loss by engaging in private \"street justice.\" They simply will not incriminate themselves by reporting the stolen gun anymore than a drug dealer will call the police to report that someone broke in and stole all his cocaine-and no law can force them to do so.",

   "sinjin I have said all throughout my posts that I make no excuses for our murderous drug trade and our burgeoning gang problems. I am looking for REAL solutions to our problems, not phony feel good ones that persecutes the 2nd Amendment. \n \n Situations in societies create differing problems and solutions to each problem. However, if one says gun control is going to solve the problem and murders actually go up, and Violent Crime goes up drastically, then one must conclude that that solution did not work. The exact thing happened in Australia, except that their murder rate did not rise drastically, but fluctuated normally. Not only did it NOT work, but so much so that both the National Academy of Sciences and the CDC exhaustive gun control studies could not say that the gun laws and even a combination of gun laws had any effect on violent outcomes. \n \n Here are the causes of crime and murders in our county. By ignoring these and seeking to lay all of these cause on the law-abiding gun owner. How is that even remotely fair. Gun controllers make us conclude that they are being disingenuous, and even using these crime factors to further their aim of more and more and more and even more gun control. \n \n One might also conclude that that by focusing on phony solutions that they may actually even be impeding real solutions. \n \n Now if you do not mind, show us which of these your solution solves. \n \n  FBI - Crime in the United States, 2002\n Crime factors from the FBI website\n \n Historically, the causes and origins of crime have been the subjects of investigation by many disciplines. Some factors that are known to affect the volume and type of crime occurring from place to place are:\n \u00b7 Population density and degree of urbanization. \n \u00b7 Variations in composition of the population, particularly youth concentration. \n \u00b7 Stability of population with respect to residents' mobility, commuting patterns, and transient factors. \n \u00b7 Modes of transportation and highway system. \n \u00b7 Economic conditions, including median income, poverty level, and job availability. \n \u00b7 Cultural factors and educational, recreational, and religious characteristics. \n \u00b7 Family conditions with respect to divorce and family cohesiveness. \n \u00b7 Climate. \n \u00b7 Effective strength of law enforcement agencies. \n \u00b7 Administrative and investigative emphases of law enforcement. \n \u00b7 Policies of other components of the criminal justice system (i.e., prosecutorial, judicial, correctional, and probational). \n \u00b7 Citizens' attitudes toward crime. \n \u00b7 Crime reporting practices of the citizenry. \n\n   Violence in America - Effective Solutions \n more than two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are involved with drug trafficking or have evidence of ante-mortem illicit drug use.\n \n Not only do the data show that acquaintance and domestic homicide are a minority of homicides,[26] but the FBI's definition of acquaintance and domestic homicide requires only that the murderer knew or was related to the decedent. That dueling drug dealers are acquainted does not make them \"friends.\" Over three-quarters of murderers have long histories of violence against not only their enemies and other \"acquaintances,\" but also against their relatives.\n \n The gun control advocacy literature from the \"medical community\" shows that fully two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are, in fact, drug dealers and their customers who wreak tremendous human and economic havoc upon society. In failing to account for this, the medical literature cannot and does not honestly assess these deaths.\" \n\n \n http://www.davekopel.org/CJ/Mags/InnerCityCrisis.htm]  CRIME: THE INNER-CITY CRISIS [/url]\n The problem of youth homicide is very heavily concentrated in black males aged 15-19.3\n For inner-city black teenagers, the homicide rate is astronomical. The huge rise in gun crime perpetrated by older urban teenagers has not been replicated in other areas. In the suburbs, where legal restrictions on guns are generally less severe, the mortality rate has stayed about the same.\n \n Gun control advocates sometimes convey the impression that current murder rates are dramatically higher than ever before. And if one looks at statistics for particular age groups, one finds a substantial rise in murder arrests. From 1985 to 1991, arrests of adults for murder declined, but arrests for murder of 17-year-old males rose 121%; arrests of 16-year-old males rose 158%; arrests of 15-year-old males rose 217%; and arrests of boys 12 and under rose 100%.\n \n The white youth homicide arrest rate has remained stable, while the black rate has skyrocketed. Some drug policy scholars trace the sudden upsurge in violence to the pharmacological effects of crack/cocaine. Economist Sam Staley argues that the war on drugs and the criminalization of the drug trade generate levels of violence that make the inner city unlivable, with levels of violence far higher than would occur in a world where drugs were controlled by means other than the criminal law.20 Since drug dealers are likely to be carrying large sums of money, they are at serious risk of robbery. Since they cannot rely on the police for protection, they must, to survive, protect themselves. \n\n \n   Fact 7: Crime, Violence, and Drug Use Go Hand-In-Hand \n From the DEA\n \n A 1997 FBI study of violence against law enforcement officers found that 24 percent of the assailants were under the influence of drugs at the time they attacked the officers and that 72 percent of the assailants had a history of drug law violations.\n\n \n   In sum, increased firearm availability to honest, responsible people--of any race--does not cause increased violence. \n Neither is lower firearm availability to such people associated with lower violence.\n \n The actual causes of murder--other than competing in the murderous drug trade--are hopelessness, poverty, and a lack of substantial employment opportunities. Studies suggest that rates of homicide and other violence among blacks are no greater than those of similarly situated whites \n \n \"Fixating on guns seems to be, for many people, a fetish which allows them to ignore the more intransigent causes of American violence, including its dying cities, inequality, deteriorating family structure, and the all-pervasive economic and social consequences of a history of slavery and racism.\"\n",

   "Well, I use a safe to hold lots of property, and this includes guns that I do not rely upon for self-defense. I do so because I feel it deters theft and also protects my guns, my papers, and my other valuables from fire damage. I think it is a good idea to have one if you can afford it, and I recommend it to everyone. But, it is one thing for me to say you should&#8212;and it is quite another for the government to say you must.\nBut might it be \"reasonable\"? \n \n \nI&#8217;m just going to have to agree to disagree on this issue Sinjin. An anti-theft law runs counter to my understanding of a core principle of our system of criminal justice&#8212;we do not punish the innocent for the crimes of the guilty. An anti-theft storage law threatens to turn burglary victims into criminals. Such a law would serve to deter the reporting of a burglary by persons who did not have their guns stored in accordance with the wishes of government. For them, the law would provide an incentive to ignore the criminal justice system and instead try to recover their property by means of vigilante &#8220;street justice.&#8221; A law which encourages this is just not good policy in my opinion.\n \n In my opinion laws mandating reporting of gun thefts are also ill advised. Such a law also threatens to criminalize the burglary victim. The only purpose I can see for this policy goal is a belief that it would increase the number of immediate reports of burglaries and thereby aid in the recovery of stolen firearms. But in my experience I just do not see a problem with guns not being reported stolen from homes. In my experience homeowners report all property stolen as soon as they realize it. Guns are no exception. Guns are just like expensive jewelry and high-end electronics&#8212;they have tremendous value. Homeowners either want their guns back or someone to pay for the value of the loss. Many home insurance policies require a report to the police before stolen guns will be covered. A court will not order restitution for property which was not reported stolen, and I have never yet met a homeowner who didn&#8217;t want someone else, be it the insurance company or the convicted burglar, to pay for the loss when they go to court. In my experience home burglaries are already nearly always reported within minutes of their discovery&#8212;and unless a known suspect is developed quickly the guns are rarely is ever recovered. I do not see how a mandatory reporting law would increase the percentage of immediate burglary reports or the percentage of recovered firearms. Finally, there already exists a tremendous incentive for reporting a stolen gun. Even in cases where the gun is not immediately recovered, if it is found three years later hidden under a bed in a crack house raid then law enforcement is obligated to return the gun back to the one who reported it stolen. Stolen guns are entered into NCIC, and I have seen guns returned to owners that are recovered years later in other states. \n \n Now are there cases of guns being stolen in burglaries which go unreported? Yes. These cases almost always involve guns held by persons who can&#8217;t lawfully have them in the first place. For these people (felons, etc), the fear of being prosecuted for having the gun in the first place deters them from making a burglary report ( it is similar to the fear an otherwise innocent homeowner would have of being prosecuted for reporting a stolen gun which he did not have secured in a manner approved by an anti-theft storage law). These individuals are the ones who are most likely to try instead to get restitution for their loss by engaging in private &#8220;street justice.&#8221; They simply will not incriminate themselves by reporting the stolen gun anymore than a drug dealer will call the police to report that someone broke in and stole all his cocaine&#8212;and no law can force them to do so. \nFirstly, theft reporting laws are meant to target those who arm criminals and later simply claim that the gun was stolen/lost when it turns up at a crime scene. Secondly, I understand that the negligent might think not to report but if failure to report could make one an accessory to any crime committed with the gun, or liable for damages caused by the gun, it might be better to report even if it carried a penalty. Making negligent gun owners criminals is just fine by me. All at the discretion of my DA of course.\n \n And thank you as always for your thoughtful and intelligent contributions.",

   "Like Don Quixote we go about fighting windmills, rather than address the Real Problem. We would rather blame the object rather than the person. Therefore, there still exist a segment of our people, especially some dysfunctional youth, have received the impression that it is OK to take out their frustrations and disappointments at the point of a gun, or what is worse, sometimes with bombs. Why do these problems still exist? They exist because we refuse to do Anything to help these people. We have also raised a sub culture where gangs socialize some of our country's precious youth. In these instances, the gang has replaced the family and society's norms and mores, with the norms and morays of the gang leadership. \n \n This is clearly not a legislative problem, it is a Social Problem. If your goal is to truly cure our crime problem, and that is my goal, we cure sick people with Doctors, and we cure the dysfunctional with behavior modification. Not Gun Control! \n \n How can Gun Control cure anyone? \n \n If we were to ban every gun, bottle, knife, rock, bowling ball etc. from the planet the Dysfunctional will just use something you have not yet banned. They will beat the hell out of us with a baseball bat or a golf club, or perhaps blow us up with something we cannot ban like gasoline or propane. Perhaps they will start throwing acid, or poisoning us. \n \n How can gun control cure one person? It cannot. \n \n England has proven that even if guns are totally banned, the criminals will just import them in with their drugs. Canada's problems with licensing and registration has proven to be a nightmare where Police complain about cost effectiveness, and say that the money would have been better spent on more policemen. But there again, supplying more cops and equipment might actually work, and then they could not use crime as an excuse to persecute the gun rights. The Citizens there are angry, and the Government officials are fighting the liberal government because of unbelievable cost overruns. The only thing gun control does is satisfy the Anti-gunners lust for the destruction of the 2nd Amendment, and to take guns away form Law Abiding people, but Amazingly and non existent, not the criminals. \n \n The only thing that will cure this societal problem is if we change what is in the hearts and minds of man. We need to do a better job of socializing our youth, making sure none of them slip through the cracks. We need to teach our people right from wrong. \n \n To ignore this simple truth is sheer folly. \n \n If you say you want to stop the senseless gun violence and do not work to change what is in the hearts and minds of men, you are guilty of everything you accuse the Pro-gunners of being. If you only work to remove guns from our Law Abiding will we be any safer? \n \n Prohibition was a total flop. As a matter fact, it caused one of the most violent times in our history. The Gang wars of the Roaring Twenties. Now look at the violence that Drugs are causing? We are already aware of the fact that the U.S. Government cannot prevent drugs from coming into this country even for ten minutes. How long have we been fighting this war on Drugs? For over thirty years, and drugs are as prevalent as they have ever been. Given these examples, and the example of England, I am absolutely sure that we all are aware that there will be 10,000% availability of illegal guns for any Rapist, Predator, Criminal, and Thug who wants one, or even a dozen more to sell. Plus, even if all firearms are illegal, and if one were to illegally obtain a gun, why not own and use automatic weapons, just like the gangs in England are now using? What would be the logical reason to own a single shot weapon? They both are illegal! The only people who will be disarmed will be the Law Abiding citizen who are not the problem. We will be defenseless! \n \n Question: if your spouse or perhaps one of your children were about to meet one of these dysfunctional, or a newly socialized gang member, would you hope that they came from a Gun control rally or would you dearly hope he came from a Psychiatrists office? \n \n The question is, do you really want crime control, or just only gun control, because guns hurt your sensibility, and hang the Constitution? Crime will never be cleaned up until we as a society do the hard work of proper socialization. To ignore this fact is sheer folly!\n \n   Groups link media to child violence ",

   "Like Don Quixote we go about fighting windmills, rather than address the Real Problem. We would rather blame the object rather than the person. Therefore, there still exist a segment of our people, especially some dysfunctional youth, have received the impression that it is OK to take out their frustrations and disappointments at the point of a gun, or what is worse, sometimes with bombs. Why do these problems still exist? They exist because we refuse to do Anything to help these people. We have also raised a sub culture where gangs socialize some of our country's precious youth. In these instances, the gang has replaced the family and society's norms and mores, with the norms and morays of the gang leadership. \n \n This is clearly not a legislative problem, it is a Social Problem. If your goal is to truly cure our crime problem, and that is my goal, we cure sick people with Doctors, and we cure the dysfunctional with behavior modification. Not Gun Control! \n \n How can Gun Control cure anyone? \n \n If we were to ban every gun, bottle, knife, rock, bowling ball etc. from the planet the Dysfunctional will just use something you have not yet banned. They will beat the hell out of us with a baseball bat or a golf club, or perhaps blow us up with something we cannot ban like gasoline or propane. Perhaps they will start throwing acid, or poisoning us. \n \n How can gun control cure one person? It cannot. \n \n England has proven that even if guns are totally banned the criminals will just import them in with their drugs. Canada's problems with licensing and registration has proven to be a nightmare where Police complain about cost effectiveness and say the money would have been better spent on more policemen. But there again supplying more cops and equipment might actually work, and then they could not use crime as an excuse to persecute the 2nd Amendment. The Citizens are angry and the Government officials are fighting the liberal government because of unbelievable cost overruns. The only thing gun control does is satisfy the Anti-gunners lust for the destruction of the 2nd Amendment, and to take guns away form Law Abiding people, but Amazingly non existent, not the criminals. \n \n The only thing that will cure this societal problem is if we change what is in the hearts and minds of man. We need to do a better job of socializing our youth, making sure none of them slip through the cracks. We need to teach our people right from wrong. \n \n To ignore this simple truth is sheer folly. \n \n If you say you want to stop the senseless gun violence and do not work to change what is in the hearts and minds of men you are guilty of everything you accuse the Pro-gunners of being. If you only work to remove guns from our Law Abiding will we be any safer? \n \n Prohibition was a total flop. As a matter fact, it caused one of the most violent times in our history. The Gang wars of the Roaring Twenties. Now look at the violence that Drugs are causing? We are already aware of the fact that the U.S. Government cannot prevent drugs from coming into this country even for ten minutes. How long have we been fighting this war on Drugs? For over thirty years, and drugs are as prevalent than they ever have been. Given these examples, and the example of England, I am absolutely sure that we all are aware that there will be 10,000% availability of illegal guns for any Rapist, Predator, Criminal, and Thug who wants one, or even a dozen more to sell. Plus, even if all firearms are illegal, and if one were to illegally obtain a gun, why not own and use automatic weapons, just like the gangs in England are now using? What would be the logical reason to own a single shot weapon? They both are illegal! The only people who will be disarmed will be the Law Abiding citizen who are not the problem. We will be defenseless! \n \n Question: if your spouse or perhaps one of your children were about to meet one of these dysfunctional, or a newly socialized gang member, would you hope that they came from a Gun control rally or would you dearly hope he came from a Psychiatrists office? \n \n The question is, do you really want crime control or just only gun control because guns hurt your sensibility, and hang the Constitution? Crime will never be cleaned up until we as a society do the hard work of proper socialization. To ignore this fact is sheer folly!\n \n   Groups link media to child violence \n\n \n Big +1. This country is going down because of the lack social responsibility, enforcement and rehabilitation. People are willing to give up their constitutional rights for stupid things like spinners, drugs, and of course a job where they do nothing.",

   "Whew! I finally have a few minutes before I go to bed.\n \n sinjin you mentioned the low murder rates of both England and Australia as if that proved gun control caused their lower murder rates. However you failed to take into account the fact that before 1997, and the institution of their draconian gun control laws, they already had low murder rates because that is a normal condition for their society. Maybe it is their social conditions and their socialization or whatever, however life is not as cheap as it seems to be here in our inner cities. That is the shameful facts.\n \n Australia's murder rate has remained constant for a very long time. Yes it has normal fluctuations up and down but it is pretty much a flat line ever since the 1920's. I hope we can learn something from them someday, but their rates are not because of their gun control! \n \n As for speaking of England's 2007 murder rate. \nThe rise in gun crime represents an increase of 427 offences to a total of 10,182 firearms offences, but Home Office statisticians said the main increase had been in incidents in which guns had been used to threaten but no one had been hurt.\n \n The number of gun-related deaths went down from 55 to 49 in the year to September 2007. Incidents involving serious injury also fell, by 16%.\n\n Good. I feel for our cousins, the British. However after years of increase, one year hardly makes a crime trend. But I wish them luck.\n \n However, if gun control actually worked as advertised, shouldn't their crime rates and their murder rates have gone down? Just a question of logic. \n \n Then you mentioned our high murder rate, as if guns was the cause of it. However, even if we totally banned guns and subtracted all of the murders committed with firearms, as if some magic happened and no substitution were to take place at all,(and as if that were possible to be even a likely scenario) our murder rate would still higher than both Australia and or England's with all of the firearms murders subtracted out. Probably because of our socialization and our social conditions.\n \n In my community of Fairview Park, a community of about 200,000, we had zero murders. What shall we deduce from that? If we add in the other 3 surrounding suburbs it would add up to well over a million citizens and probably closer to 1.5 million. We suffered 1 murder in all of our surrounding communities last year and none the year before. What shall we glean from that?\n \n Maybe since we have a much higher concentration of homes with firearms than our fellow citizens in Cleveland, we can say guns are the cause of our low murder rate! Not really. :)\n \n It is more likely that this is a fact because of intact family structures, higher education levels, better parenting, better peer groupings etc.\n \n And then there was the time when I spent a lifetime in a Cleveland Housing Project in just the 3 years I needed to retrain after my disability. My eyes were forced wide Flippen Open. The socialization seemed more like one would see in a wild animal setting than anything produced by a civilized society. The gangs and the drug dealers socialized many of the children, and if you applied yourself in school, the black kids were made fun of and told they were acting white. The white kids were also ridiculed as well. Cleveland, during those years, had a high school graduation rate of 39%. \n \n So now, does anyone want to tell me again how come many of these kids grow up to be thugs and predators? The lack of gun control? Please! They are acting exactly like they are being taught! Socialization, pure and simple.",

   "But might it be \"reasonable\"? \n \n Firstly, theft reporting laws are meant to target those who arm criminals and later simply claim that the gun was stolen/lost when it turns up at a crime scene. Secondly, I understand that the negligent might think not to report but if failure to report could make one an accessory to any crime committed with the gun, or liable for damages caused by the gun, it might be better to report even if it carried a penalty. Making negligent gun owners criminals is just fine by me. All at the discretion of my DA of course.\n \n And thank you as always for your thoughtful and intelligent contributions.\n\n \n \n I do not believe the targets you suggest will be impeded by a theft reporting law. These individuals are already making a calculation to purposely violate the law. For them the immediate economic gain far outweighs the consideration of any reasonable punishment you could suggest which might or might not be imposed in the remote event the gun happened to be recovered later.\n \n Now let me turn to your accessory liability proposal. I am going to strongly disagree with the suggestion that we should hold a victimized homeowner criminally responsible for the subsequent actions of his burglar. If a murder is committed with a stolen gun, then we should respond to it in the manner we have always done: \n \n We should hold those who are a truly at fault accountable&#8212;the person who chose to kill while acting on an unjustifiable motive, be it anger, hatred, revenge, greed, etc. \n \n We should seek to hold accountable the person who knew right from wrong, who understood the nature and consequences of his actions, and who made a conscious choice to take someone&#8217;s life without a shred of legitimate excuse or justification. \n \n We should further hold those responsible who choose to work with the killer towards the accomplishment of a common scheme or plan&#8212;those who agree the murder should occur and who take an active role to encourage, entice, or assist the killer accomplish his goal. \n \n This is how we should respond to murder.\n \n I have said before that this is not a new or novel concept. It has formed the foundation of our system of criminal justice for more than two centuries.\n \n In my opinion your proposal amounts to a radical expansion of the criminal doctrine of accessory liability. I want to use my state&#8217;s jury instructions to illustrate this point. The instructions will be &#8220;in italics.&#8221; \n \n Let&#8217;s assume a gun is used to commit a murder. Here is where criminal liability starts:\n \n The principal in the first degree&#8212;the gunman who actually pulls the trigger: &#8220;A principal in the first degree is the person who actually commits the crime.&#8221; \n \n The first level of accessory liability is for those who are also present at the crime scene and who are encouraging/helping the killer (urging him to shoot, handing the gun to the shooter, acting as a lookout/getaway driver, etc). We call these &#8220;accessories&#8221; to the crime &#8220;principals in the second degree&#8221;:\n \n &#8220;A principal in the second degree is a person who is present and assists by helping in the commission of the crime. It must be shown that he intended by his words, gestures, signals or actions to encourage, advise, urge, or help the person who actually committed the crime. Presence and consent alone are not sufficient to make a person a principle in the second degree.&#8221; \n \n Those who helped, counseled, or advised beforehand but who are not present when the crime is committed can also be held liable as an &#8220;accessory before the fact&#8221; (for example, a person hiring someone to kill their spouse, or someone providing the gun to the killer beforehand while both knowing that the crime will and agreeing that the crime should happen):\n \n &#8220;An accessory before the fact is one who was not present at the time of the commission of the crime, but who, before the commission of the crime, in some way planned, advised or assisted in the commission of the crime, knowing or having reason to know of the intent of the principal to commit the crime.&#8221;\n \n This is the common law theory of accessory liability which has served my state well for over 200 years&#8212;from capital murder all the way down to possession of alcohol under the age or 21. You cannot be an accessory to the crime of another unless I can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you knew the crime will be/is being committed, that you shared a common desire or willingness to have the crime occur, and that you did something to encourage or help bring that crime about. \n \n Your theory of accessory liability for homeowners having a gun stolen in a burglary turns all this on its head. Your theory amends the law of accessory liability to read:\n \n &#8220;Unless you are a gun owner who did not secure your firearm in a manner approved by the board of safe gun storage. In which case you are responsible for every future crime your gun is used in&#8212;committed by a person you have never met&#8212;and whose only connection to you is that he chose to commit the felony offense of taking your firearm from you against your will. \n Your liability as an accessory to his future crimes is justified solely because the Commonwealth believes you made it easier for him to make you his first victim.\n With this in mind, the Commonwealth is not required to prove that you have any knowledge of his future crimes, nor is it required to prove that you took any action to encourage, advise, urge, or help the burglar commit the future crime. Additionally, any claim of opposition to what your burglar did to you first and to someone else later does not prohibit or limit your accessory liability. \n You can be charged as an accessory for each and every subsequent gun crime committed by your burglar, and this liability is not diminished by your complete inability to control, know about, or even predict his future actions.&#8221; \n \n We have all probably heard the famous question: &#8220;Am I my brother&#8217;s keeper?&#8221; For me, this proposal for homeowner accessory liability begs the question: &#8220;Am I now to be my burglar&#8217;s keeper?&#8221; I believe the proposal answers &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and I believe it threatens to open a long and dangerous road of imposing criminal liability on the innocent that would not stop at just the despised gun owning homeowner, but which would ultimately expand to other, non-gun crimes. \n \n Therefore, Sinjin, I must respectfully disagree.",

Criminal intent is knowingly GIVING the firearm to a convicted felon or other prohibited persons. If you did not know, proof of criminal intent has not been established! Next the prosecutor would have to show a jury that you intended to break the law. Confession from the criminal or videotaping the transaction, or someone providing testimony that you, in fact, knew that he was a criminal, prohibited from owning a firearm, and you intended to break the law. \n \n The burden of proof is 100% on the State.

Whether or not he is a felon, if you give someone a gun knowing they intend to commit a particular crime with it then you are responsible as an accessory before the fact. It requires more than just speculation, however. It requires that you knew of the criminal intent, and that giving the gun \"assisted\" in the commission of the crime.

   "Care to cite some of those extrapolations now moving through Ohio courts?\n\n \n I asked two lawyers who post on Ohioans for Concealed Carry.\n \n \nI'm currently drafting a brief analogizing, in part, Title VII employer liability to Title VIII Fair Housing Act actions. The point is to support a post-acquisition discrimination claim against a landlord who failed to intervene in the case of tenant-on-tenant racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3604(b) and 3617. The critical difference is that Title VII actions employ vicarious liability through agency while Title VIII actions lack the agency element.\n\n \n \n\"Public Nuisance\" statutes of many states. They are typically civil tort laws. What constitutes a public nuisance is usually not well defined. I think we'd all agree that a guy who starts burning poison ivy in his back yard is creating a public nuisance even if open burning isn't specifically illegal. Ditto for an absentee landlord who lets a property fall into such disrepair that it detracts from the surrounding property values and attracts vermin. In most cases, the public nuisance laws were enacted to enable injured parties to recover damages from someone who creates a public nuisance. For example, if the city has to pay $50,000 to clean up your property they would have recourse whereas if they just cited you for the various building violations they might not come close to recovering their costs on fines alone.\n \n What we've seen is that public nuisance suits have been levied against just about anything and in significantly wider scales than expected. Prior to being outlawed by Congress, many suits against gun manufacturers were brought under public nuisance laws claiming that the manufacturers of a 100% legal product were responsible for causing public harm even though they had nothing to do with the underlying criminal act. I could be mistaken, but I believe this is the route that New York was pursuing.\n \n Public nuisance laws have been used to go after paint manufacturers for lead paint - never mind that when the paint was used it was legal and nobody knew about the hazards. The Rhode Island Supreme Court recently dismissed a public nuisance suit against paint manufacturers and ordered the state to pay the defendants' legal bills - over $200,000 if I remember right. Since that decision other states, including Ohio, have been reconsidering whether they want to continue pursuing their cases.\n \n <flamesuit=\"On\"<Personally I would like to see the ##### ice fishers who necessitate a Coast Guard and fire department rescue each year be charged with creating a public nuisance and each person billed a pro rata share of the rescue effort's costs rather than the relatively low fines that are sometimes imposed.</flamesuit<\n \n PN lawsuits are also handy for getting around the usual statutes of limitation because if you can prove that the nuisance is on-going, for example, asbestos and lead paint removal efforts continue today, you can often go back to what started the nuisance even if it was 100 years ago.\n",

   "Yes&#8212;if you knew he was intending to commit a crime with the gun you gave him. Whether or not he is a felon, if you give someone a gun knowing they intend to commit a particular crime with it then you are responsible as an accessory before the fact. It requires more than just speculation, however. It requires that you knew of the criminal intent, and that giving the gun &#8220;assisted&#8221; in the commission of the crime. It requires a meeting of the minds over the common scheme or plan to commit a crime which you agree to assist by providing the weapon.\nWhere the person you gave the gun to was not a felon. Correct? Must you have specific knowledge of a specific crime when they are a felon?\n \n \nWe do not have a meeting of the minds or any kind of agreement when a burglar steals your gun against your will.\nAnd when you choose not to report that theft to police? No change in your level of involvement? Morally or legally? \n \n \nBurglars tend to conceal their minds and their criminal intent from their victims. I do not think we can assume that a homeowner can know the mind of his burglar and predict his next move any more than he was able to predict the burglar breaking into his own home.

Guess not according to my understanding of your statements.\n \n Burglary is a felony, yes?\n \n The occasional fine dining experience overshadows any amount of fast food.;)\n \n Thanks.\n\n \n To be an accessory before the fact, you have to have specific knowledge that the person you are giving the gun to intends to go commit a crime with it. This is the rule whether or not the person you are arming is already a felon. You do not have to know what the exact crime is, you only have to have knowledge of the specific event planned by the person you are giving the gun to. An accessory before the fact is responsible for all crimes committed during the execution of the common plan he has assisted beforehand, whether he knew about the additional crimes or not (for example, if I give a person a gun to commit a bank robbery, and he tells me \"I promise I won't hurt anyone,\" but during the robbery he shoots and kills the teller, then I am guilty of the murder as well even if I did not intend for that to happen)\n \n Accessories before the fact can receive the exact same punishment as the person who actually commits the crime (the only exception is Virginia's \"trigger man rule,\" which holds that except in the case of murder-for-hire only the trigger man can receive the death penalty in a capital murder case-so in the example above I could receive life but not a death sentence for providing the robber/killer with the gun). \n \n From a legal standpoint, failing to report a stolen gun has no impact on whether you could be considered an accessory before the fact. Whether there is any degree of moral culpability for crimes committed with the gun after it was stolen and not reported would in my opinion be for the individual reader to decide. \n \n In my state, home burglary is a felony punished by a maximum sentence of 1-20 years, unless the burglar is armed with a deadly weapon when he breaks in, which increases the punishment to 20 years to life. Stealing an operable firearm is also a felony called grand larceny, which can be punished by a maximum 20 year sentence. Therefore, a person who breaks into my home while I am away and steals a gun from me faces a maximum penalty of 40 years for the burglary/grand larceny. However, none of this time is mandatory, and the average sentence in my state for a conviction of both grand larceny and burglary is probation without any incarceration if the burglar does not already have a prior felony record.",

   "NATO, that's a good question without a satisfactory answer. In my state all sentences imposed are tracked by the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission This commission is responsible for calculating the average sentence given throughout the state for each type of crime, but paradoxically the agency charged with calculating the averages does not release that data to the public. Instead, it uses the data to create average \"sentencing guidelines\" which probation officers use to tell judges what other judges are doing for particular crimes throughout the state. Although we talk about the guidelines in court during a sentencing event (and by and large prosecutors mock them for their leniency), the guidelines are sealed documents and are not otherwise open for public inspection. You can find VCSC reports online which will happily tell you how often each jurisdiction follows the guideline recommendations in sentencing, but the agency will not tell you what those guidelines (containing the average sentence) actually are. \n \n My knowledge of burglary/grand larceny average sentencing for first time offenders (which is generally probation) comes from institutional knowledge of 15 years experience handling cases like this.\n Now in my opinion criminalizing a gun owner for not reporting the theft would not be a violation of due process. I could probably write a law which could avoid that issue-but I won't. I'm opposed to criminalizing burglary victims as a matter of public policy. \n \n To prove a crime of making a false report I have to prove more than just that the report was false. I also have to prove you knew it was false at the time you made it. An honest mistake does not constitute a false report of a crime to a law enforcement officer.",
