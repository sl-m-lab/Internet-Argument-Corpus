I am really interested in what if anything about this ad is honest.\n \n YouTube - NOM - Gathering Storm\n \n \nThe National Organization for Marriage, which spearheaded the start of the Proposition 8 campaign in California, is launching a national effort to organize two million opponents of same-sex marriage.\n \n They hope the new activists will be the ground troops of \"an online army of marriage activists willing to stand up for marriage on a moment's notice, sending emails and making phone calls to legislators whenever marriage is threatened,\" according to an e-mail sent to supporters.\n \n The group plans to air a new TV ad called \"A Gathering Storm\" featuring testimonials from gay marriage opponents.\n \n The ad, at least initially, won't be airing in California, but other battleground gay marriage states.

   "Background Ad Rebuttal\n \"The Real Truth Behind the Fake Ad\"\n \n The general argument of the ad is that the push for marriage equality isn't just about rights for same-sex couples, it's about imposing contrary values on people of faith. The examples they cite in the ad are: \n \n (1) A California doctor who must choose between her faith and her job\n \n (2) A member of New Jersey church group which is punished by the state because they can't support same-sex marriage\n \n (3) A Massachusetts parent who stands by helpless while the state teaches her son that gay marriage is okay \n \n The facts indicate that (1) refers to the Benitez decision in California, determining that a doctor cannot violate California anti-discrimination law by refusing to treat a lesbian based on religious belief, (2) refers to the Ocean Grove, New Jersey Methodist pavilion that was open to the general public for events but refused access for civil union ceremonies (and was fined by the state for doing so) and (3) refers to the Parker decision in Massachusetts, where parents unsuccessfully sought to end public school discussions of family diversity, including of same-sex couples. \n \n All three examples involve religious people who enter the public sphere, but don't want to abide by the general non-discriminatory rules everyone else does. Both (1) and (2) are really about state laws against sexual orientation discrimination, rather than specifically about marriage. And (3) is about two pairs of religious parents trying to impose their beliefs on all children in public schools. \n \n The real facts of each case are:\n The California doctor entered a profession that promises to \"first, do no harm\" and the law requires her to treat a patient in need - gay or straight, Christian or Muslim - regardless of her religious beliefs. The law does not, and cannot, dictate her faith - it can only insist that she follow her oath as a medical professional. \n \n The New Jersey church group runs, and profits from, a beachside pavilion that it rents out to the general public for all manner of occasions -concerts, debates and even Civil War reenactments- but balks at permitting couples to hold civil union ceremonies there. The law does not challenge the church organization's beliefs about homosexuality - it merely requires that a pavilion that had been open to all for years comply with laws protecting everyone from discrimination, including gays and lesbians. \n The Massachusetts parent disagrees with an aspect of her son's public education, a discussion of the many different kinds of families he will likely encounter in life, including gay and lesbian couples. The law does not stop her from disagreeing, from teaching him consistently with her differing beliefs at home, or even educating her child in a setting that is more in line with her faith traditions. But it does not allow any one parent to dictate the curriculum for all students based on her family's religious traditions.\n \n HRC | Human Rights Campaign Exposes National Organization for Marriage's Fake Ad for Fake Problems",

The main issue here is not the minute squabble over timing or even the basis behind such actions as closing peoples business due to them knowing it's over gays and lesbians.\n \n The issue at hand is that it is a problem. Gays and Lesbians should not have to be singled out or been thought as a \"special\" group, especially under the law. GLBT people shouldn't have to go to special wedding planners or clergy or such. But due to the discrimination by those claiming to be \"christian\" we see the gap widen and the distinction between being gay and being strait in society even grow more and more diverse.\n \n To be willing to close a business over someones sexual orientation just shows how misinformed and how ignorant mainstream people really are. To think of gays and lesbians as a \"plague\" or a \"disease\" upon this nation or any other nation for that matter is not only hateful and based upon ignorance and blind assumption. But it is also very discriminatory and very bigoted. To blame gays and lesbians for problems that they are not directly involved in, and to put them within the same category as \"heathens\" and \"works of Satan\" and so forth is hurtful, demoralizing, and shocking to those who only seek normality and fair treatment and equal rights, just as their heterosexual citizens already do.",

Let me know if you need more for it to sink in. \n \n \n[Vermont Senate panel unanimously passes gay marriage bill\n MONTPELIER - A state Senate committee unanimously passed a gay marriage bill yesterday, moving Vermont one step closer to allowing same-sex couples to legally wed.\n \n \"It provides. . . gay and lesbian couples the same rights that I have as a married heterosexual,\" said Senator John Campbell, vice chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and chief sponsor of the bill.\n \n The measure would replace Vermont's first-in-the-nation civil unions law with one that allows marriage of same-sex partners beginning Sept. 1.\n \n The committee's vote ended an intense week highlighted by a public hearing Wednesday night in which more than 500 people swarmed the State House to speak for and against allowing same-sex marriages.\n \n If approved, Vermont would join Massachusetts and Connecticut as the only US states that allow gays and lesbians to marry.\n \n Civil unions, which confer some rights similar to marriage, would still be recognized but no longer granted after Sept. 1.\n \n Campbell said marriage is an improvement over civil unions both substantively and as a matter of wording.\n \n On the first score, he said, marriage is more widely legally recognized than civil unions. If a couple from Vermont got into an accident in Kansas, a spouse probably would have a stronger claim to hospital visitation rights if they were married than if they were in a civil union, he said.\n \n Semantically, Campbell argued that if there were no difference, opponents of same-sex marriage would not be so vehement that the word \"marriage\" should apply only to heterosexual unions. \"Children should be able to say to their friends that their parents are married, and not have to explain what a civil union is,\" he added.\n \n Both Houses, under Democratic control, are expected to pass the measure. The Senate is taking the lead and is expected to debate the bill next week.\n \n Governor Jim Douglas, a Republican, has said he opposes the bill but has declined to say whether he will veto it if it reaches his desk.\n \n \"I've made my position quite clear that I believe marriage is and ought to remain the union of a man and a woman, that our civil unions law affords equality of opportunities and rights under state law and that that should suffice,\" the governor said on the eve of the Senate committee vote.\n \n The bill would exempt members of the clergy from performing same-sex marriages if their faiths forbid such unions, and would bar lawsuits prompted by such refusals.\n \n The exemption would not extend to justices of the peace and other public officials who perform civil marriages but who might object to officiating at same-sex unions. Those people are agents of the government and are barred by law from discriminating based on sexual orientation, Campbell said.\n \n Vermont in 2000 became the first state in the country to pass a civil unions law, which grants many of the rights and responsibilities of marriage to same-sex couples. But gay marriage advocates have argued since then that the law does not go far enough. California, New Jersey, and New Hampshire also permit civil unions.\n \n Yesterday's committee vote followed the panel's rejection of an amendment proposed by state Senator Kevin Mullin, a Republican, that would have put the gay marriage question to a statewide referendum next March. After the amendment was defeated, Mullin joined his colleagues in voting 5-0 for the bill.\n \n The committee's action drew praise from a leader of the Vermont Freedom to Marry Task Force, one of the leading organizations supporting gay marriage in the state, and condemnation from a leader of the anti-gay-marriage Marriage Advisory Council.\n \n \"The committee was attentive throughout the week. They heard a wide range of witnesses on a wide range of issues, and I think, ultimately, they did the right thing,\" said Beth Robinson, chairwoman of the Freedom to Marry Task Force.\n \n Stephen Cable, president of the group Vermont Renewal, an organization that opposes same-sex marriage, said the civil unions law and the possible passage of a gay marriage bill shows the state \"no longer seeks to promote that each child have a mother and a father. And I think that's shameful and very sad.\"\n\n \n I haven't seen a gay marriage bill that does not include this exclusion. Please post one if you can find one.\n \n Vermont Senate panel unanimously passes gay marriage bill - The Boston Globe",

You twist everything, from democracy, to the Constitution, to the civil rights movement, in a pathetic attempt to force people to accept you, when they clearly reject you. It is truly sad the lengths that you would go to, to be accepted. A strong person would find acceptance in himself instead of trying to use force to gain acceptance, a concept you clearly want nothing to do with.\n \n \n\n And all you did was repeat what I did, refuting none of it.\n \n\n \n That is of course a lie, but you are free to believe that.

I will never \"realize\" this. \n \n I totally agree that denying people rights to decide what words in the English language mean, and what values people will have is wrong. It's unfortunate that you do not agree with this. I agree that having a lot of people agree with you is not necessarily a good reason for denying rights. It is just as bad to deny people's rights to believe what they wish merely because you want people to accept behavior that they consider repugnant.

I'd be in favor of the government taking no more action at all on this. Just stop all government policies regarding gays from ever being passed again. Can you say the same? You can't, because you are the one who wants government to step in and tell people what to do (after it's been hijacked by liberal judges, or by a decision made by politicians in a state capital). \n \n Again, no one cares what you do with your boyfriend in your home. You are the one who cares how people regard gays. \n \n \n\n Many constitutional ideals are invoked, one of which is freedom of religion.\n How can I have freedom of religion if I have to follow your religion's rules???\n \n\n \n A clumsy mistake. I'm agnostic and I am not a Christian, Jew, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist or any other organized religion. So obviously it was dishonest of you to say that you must follow my religion, when I have none of those religious doctrines to offer you even if I tried. \n \n \n\n Other constitutional ideals are also invoked like equal protection.

You can live your life in your own restrictive way as you see fit.\n You don't have to \"follow\" my morality at all...\n \n\n \n Same goes for you.

You say that you can't understand why people won't give up their attempts to use the government to change what people believe, yet that is EXACTLY what you are doing. Why don't you and other gay activists just leave us alone? Why must you try to get us to recognize your union and respect it? We don't, so please leave us alone. I am totally in favor of you having all the tax benefits, and benefits of seeing your partner in the hospital and whatnot. Don't try to use the government to make me respect your behavior.

   "Gay marriage proponents are getting away with passing their will as law without going through a democratic process. \n \n \n \n Gay marriage is ruining lives because it teaches young impressionable minds that it is ok to engage in disgusting degenerate acts. Young people don't know any better. If people want to grow up to the age of 21 without any pro-gay influence and then decide to be gay, then I could understand that, but influencing young people from the moment they are born that being gay is alright allows them to think that something which is degenerate is acceptable. It thus increases the chance of an unknowledgeable person making a grave mistake. That is ruining a life. \n \n As for your accusation that this is a personal issue for me, rather than a broader general reason, that seems pretty hypocritical coming from a guy who spends his every waking moment of his life to legalize gay marriage.\n\n \n Ok I am 21 and had NO gay influence. I'm a veteran, a tax payer, a christian and I'm also as ##### as a three dollar bill. I was raised by heterosexual parents in a strong heterosexual environment so then why am I gay?\n \n Let me make this perfectly clear to you. You cannot teach someone to be gay! It is just as natural as someones skin color or their eye color. It is a part of who they are. For you to sit here and say that my life is ruined is rediculous. I have a very loving smart, cute, and caring boyfriend, I'm in college working towards my music degree, and I am perfectly healthy and content with who I am. Sure there's rough patches with family and such but hey whos family is perfect?\n \n My life is NOT ruined. Jesus loves me for who I am, not what your bigoted pastor says i should be. It is people like who who spread your lies and misinformation to America's youth that now more than ever teen suicide is UP in the GLBT community. It is because of your ignorant hate filled claims that young teens in Ohio and in Massachusetts are committing suicide. \n \n It's because of your pointing of blame and incomprehension to the severity of your words and those of others jsut like you that there are young teens in San Fransisco, in LA, in New York and all over America who are homelss because their families drop them the moment they realize their son is a ###### or their daughter is a ####.\n \n Well I for one shun and refute your slander. I for one say to you sir you are wrong! Today was national day of Silence for those who in the GLBT community have died for being ##### in America and around the world. \n \n I say this to you now that I for one will not be silent. I for one shall not while a breath is in me let bigotry and hate fill the minds of young Americans. I will not while there is a single cry for help and love rest until this world realizes the pain and suffering these brave and bright souls have endured. \n \n And I for one will fight to show them that they are loved! Their God loves them, and they are not sick, they are not wrong, and they are a valued as a person for who they are. If you sir cannot see past your\"moraility\" to see the suffering of these people then I dare say you are as blind and hypocritical as the Pharisee's who slandered and plotted to kill christ!",

Screwing a goat is in NO WAY the same thing as two consenting adults of the same sex engaging in sex with one another. If you wish to go further a goat does not have the brain capacity to consent. Sure it may stamp it's hooves of make a sound but that is in no way a clear indication that either the animal is in agreement or is either realizng what is happening. So your claim and basis has no solid ground to stand on.\n \n Let me also clarify this. Me engaging in intimacy with my boyfriend is not wrong, it is not sick, and I must admit is the bee's knees! I however, could say that I find your intimacy with your wife or girlfriend or secretary or what have you disgusting as well. I for one do not like the smell of raw fish mind you.\n \n As far as diminishing others lives thats their choice! You have no right to tell them that being gay is diminishing. As far as drugs it is an escape and an addiction. Sure people are addicted to sex in some regard but generally gays and lesbians engage in sex for the same reasons heterosexual couple do. A level of intimacy with whom they LOVE.\n \n As far as your \"morailty\" goes sir, I bet you have quite a bit of skeletons in your closet. Everyone does! But for you to sit here and try to blot out what you \"think\" is immoral is not only a basic violation of civil rights, it is also pure bigotry at it's finest. \n \n Klansmen thought it immoral for a black man to marry a white woman, or for blacks to be viewed as equal. Thus, they murdered such people and instilled fear on the population. In their minds it was \"immoral\" sir. \n \n As far as the government there is a separation of church and state for a reason....",

I for one shall not while a breath is in me let bigotry and hate fill the minds of young Americans. I will not while there is a single cry for help and love rest until this world realizes the pain and suffering these brave and bright souls have endured. \n \n And I for one will fight to show them that they are loved! \n \n\n \n You need a life. I have been on this forum for one day and I can see that all you do is post on this forum trying to legalize gay marriage. You prefer drama and this is all your life is about. Sad. \n \n \n\n Their God loves them, and they are not sick, they are not wrong, and they are a valued as a person for who they are. If you sir cannot see past your\"moraility\" to see the suffering of these people then I dare say you are as blind and hypocritical as the Pharisee's who slandered and plotted to kill christ!\n\n \n I'm not Christian.

   "Let me start by saying this. Screwing a goat is in NO WAY the same thing as two consenting adults of the same sex engaging in sex with one another. If you wish to go further a goat does not have the brain capacity to consent. Sure it may stamp it's hooves of make a sound but that is in no way a clear indication that either the animal is in agreement or is either realizng what is happening. So your claim and basis has no solid ground to stand on.\n\n \n Well just to set things clear, some libertarian poster was asking me why this is such a \"BFD\" and I was explaining how I felt about homosexuality using bestiality as an example of something he might find disgusting, so that he could see how I find homosexuality disgusting. I was not saying that homosexuality is the same as bestiality there. \n \n \n\n Let me also clarify this. Me engaging in intimacy with my boyfriend is not wrong, it is not sick, and I must admit is the bee's knees! I however, could say that I find your intimacy with your wife or girlfriend or secretary or what have you disgusting as well. I for one do not like the smell of raw fish mind you.\n\n \n bleh You are entitled to your opinion. \n \n \n\n As far as diminishing others lives thats their choice! You have no right to tell them that being gay is diminishing. As far as drugs it is an escape and an addiction. Sure people are addicted to sex in some regard but generally gays and lesbians engage in sex for the same reasons heterosexual couple do. A level of intimacy with whom they LOVE.\n\n \n You have no right to tell people that being gay improves them. I'll make a deal with you: I won't use the government to tell people that homosexuality is not OK and you won't use the government to tell people that homosexuality is OK. Deal? Of course you won't accept, because your whole argument is a lie. Your whole argument is to play the victim, while using the government (without a popular vote) to use force and propaganda to change people's beliefs. \n \n \n\n As far as your \"morailty\" goes sir, I bet you have quite a bit of skeletons in your closet. Everyone does! But for you to sit here and try to blot out what you \"think\" is immoral is not only a basic violation of civil rights, it is also pure bigotry at it's finest. \n\n \n You know nothing about me, and your attempt to talk about my personal life is not what one would call an honest debate. Your attempt to hijack the civil rights movement is also a well-practiced sham by the gay activist movement.\n \n \n\n Klansmen thought it immoral for a black man to marry a white woman, or for blacks to be viewed as equal. Thus, they murdered such people and instilled fear on the population. In their minds it was \"immoral\" sir. \n \n As far as the government there is a separation of church and state for a reason....\n\n \n Yeah and Mongol hordes sacked China, the Egyptians discovered papyrus, the French built a palace at Versailles. All of this is as relevant as your comments on the KKK. We're talking about gay marriage here, not random historical events. \n \n Again, your discussion of the separation of church and state is based on your religious bashing. Since I am not a member of any Church, your bigoted religious bashing is also irrelevant as an excuse to pass laws on people without a vote.",

   "You can teach someone that it's ok to be gay, and then young people will do it and think it is ok. You can teach people that it's ok to stick a paper towel roll up their butt with a hamster inside and they'll do that. People are malleable, especially young people. \n\n \n \n \n Your example is disgusting if not pure vulgarity. As far as it being ok to be gay thats a seperate issue. Would you rather someone be ok with themselves or live a depressing life filled with self guilt and ridicule?\n \n \n \n \nSo all sexual behavior is natural? Some people like to have sex with animals and inanimate objects. Was this how nature created us? Some people will #### a wall, and whatever is on the other side, so be it. The only thing that is absolutely natural is that if you have testosterone in you, you want to ####. What people choose to screw is guided by nature but not necessarily restricted to nature.\n\n \n \n \n And many species in nature have displayed homosexual tendencies. As many as 1500 to be exact. And I did not say all sexual behavior is natural, but you putting homosexuality into the same context as bestiality or something else is ridiculous.\n \n \n \n \nA child's who has been taught that being gay is fun and becomes gay has had his life ruined.\n\n \n \n \n Wow. I really hope you don't have a gay son or daughter. I can see them tricking in the Castro or on Santa Monica because you kicked them out. Your in a sad state of illusion.\n \n \n \nThe only bigot here is you. You are bigoted against religious people. I do not have any pastor because I am agnostic. I don't belong to Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shintoism or any of those religions. So when you start talking about my \"bigoted pastor\" you merely show that you are a bigot against religious people and a filthy pervert.\n\n \n \n \n Actually, Roe I am a christian. I am using the term in a generalization to those who are of the neoconservative right wing spectrum of the pulpit. And congratulations on calling me bigoted and a filthy pervert. Were you abused as a child? or beaten? seems like your lashing out for some hidden and unresolved issues here......\n \n \n \nIt is people like you who take away the decency of America's youth and corrupt them, just so that you might force people to accept you. You would tear us all down, just to bring you up a little. You use the dead to demagogue for your political agenda. You are selfish, disgusting and you have no honor.\n\n \n \n \n Use the dead? it is because of your hate filled comments and those of your constituents that they ARE DEAD!! They are a testament to the suffering gays and lesbians endure! How dare you say I use them. How dare you! And I have no honor? Me willing to risk my life and sacrifise my self for this nation and I have no honor? I must admit you have struck a nerve. Such a nerve I will not reply to your sick twisted insults for I do not wish to be banned.\n \n \n \n \nIt's because of you that there will be more children who grow up to be gay, when they might otherwise not have been. You will take away the pride and joy of many parents and destroy that, just for your convenience. You will corrupt and destroy what could have been a very fulfilling and decent life for those kids. You will do this by avoiding normal democratic procedures and forcing people to change their will by using their government against them.\n\n \n \n I cannot change peoples orientation just as much as you cannot no matter how many lies and slanders you spew from your bigoted venomous lips Roe.\n \n \n \n \nYou need a life. I have been on this forum for one day and I can see that all you do is post on this forum trying to legalize gay marriage. You prefer drama and this is all your life is about. Sad.\n\n \n \n \n My life is that of purpose Roe. I have a wonderful life. And I am not on here just about Gay marriage. But Civil Rights and Equality Roe. As far as drama I have enough of it in my daily life. I need not seek it from a slanderous closet case....\n \n \n \nI'm not Christian. What's your next move, bigot?\n\n \n \n Nothing.

   "Your idea of democracy is the Stalinist USSR. The state decides what is democratic and the people obey. \n\n That is thoroughly false.\n I believe the people can and should vote on a wide variety of tactics.\n \n But when it comes to protection of rights, like the rights of blacks or women or Jews or gays, the public should not vote to restrict rights.\n Otherwise, you have the rights of the people subject to the whim of the masses.\n \n The other really sad part of this is I am talking about the EXISTING system. The one we already have in the U.S.\n For you to declare that as \"Stalinist USSR\" is the height of absurdity!\n \n \n \nThe Constitution is a mix of rights and democracy. Democracy itself is a right, obviously one which you hold in little regard. Your position favors neither democracy nor rights.\n\n Your assessment of my position is a blatant strawman, for which you give no foundation for your assessment.\n I have talked repeatedly of affirming rights.\n \n One cannot debate with a person whereby I say \"It is white\" and the other person insists \"You think it is black\". There is no intelligible discourse there.\n Listen to my words. Respond to my words.\n \n Otherwise, you're talking out of nothing...\n \n \n \nThis line of argument of what the SCOTUS has done with regards to other laws is relevant to other laws and not relevant here.\n\n Talk about insistent denial!\n It is entirely relevant, as it shows the purpose and function of the court.\n \n I suspect the REAL problem here is that you like the idea of the courts protecting rights for SOME groups, but when it comes to the courts protecting the rights of OTHER groups, you object and think it undemocratic.\n I'm sure racists and xenophobes went through the same thing. They felt it proper to protect the rights of groups they APPROVED of, but when it comes to other groups they objected loudly thinking they had rediscovered that the wheel is round.\n What you fail to recognize is that EVERY issue of discrimination will incur somebody who objects. \n \n \n \nThe courts do need to determine was is legal, to protect this democracy and not to let a group of extremists create laws and then have those laws turned into enforcing propaganda on the citizens of the United States. It is that commitment which makes the US the leader of the free world.\n\n Nobody is creating laws here.\n It is enforcing the constitution. Enforcing equal rights.\n \n You label that as \"propaganda\", ignoring what makes this country great just cause you object loudly to gays... :xbanghead\n \n \n \nI would sooner ship you off in a crate to a country where there is no democracy, perhaps North Korea or Cuba would suit you. If you can somehow hijack the state as you are attempting here, you can then tell people what is right and what is wrong and then use the state and propaganda to enforce your will.\n\n :xbanghead\n You are obviously not listening.\n I am not telling people what is right.\n \n People like you get confused cause you think that \"equal rights\" is about \"what is right and what is wrong\".\n I think Brittany Spears was totally screwed up in her three hour wedding, but it was HER CIVIL RIGHT to get married and divorced like that.\n \n But people like YOU judge civil rights by \"right and wrong\" morality, and YOU attempt to GIVE civil rights based on \"right and wrong\" morality.\n That isn't the way it works in the U.S.\n \n \n \nIf you feel no need to engage me, then that contradicts this lengthy post and this lengthy argument that you are having with me.\n\n Over and over again, you refuse to listen to my words. You react haphazardly and quickly, failing to recognize what is really being said.\n I feel no need to change you.\n What I talk about invokes NO POWER to cause you to change.\n That is what you need to realize.\n \n \n \nIf you feel no need to engage me, why are you responding to what I write on this forum?\n\n I feel a need to refute the tyrannical prejudice I see where it exists.\n I am responding to your words.\n That is the point.\n \n \n \nYou feel the need to engage me, just you prefer to do so with dirty debate tactics and twisting around what I say.\n\n I have imposed no \"dirty debate tactics\".\n You not liking what I say is not \"dirty debate tactics\".\n \n If you want a REAL \"dirty debate tactic\", then look in the mirror when you misrepresent what I have said.\n \n \n \nI also have a fairly low opinion of people who make hypocritical arguments about rights, while taking away people's rights to determine what they believe.\n\n I urge you to THINK about what you just said...\n After all, YOU are talking about \"taking away people's rights\".\n \n And I have in no way made any effort to \"determine what you believe\".\n If you had more honesty and insight, you could recognize that you can STILL believe what you want even with gay marriage legal.\n \n \n \nI said that I could reduce your comment to a series of biased abstractions the same way you did to mine. It's a meaningless debate tactic that you employed to put spin on what I said.\n\n Your reply is meaningless.\n When courts look at issues, they look at the ABSTRACT of the issue. Is free speech involved. How does the 14th amendment apply. etc, etc...\n \n And who do you think you are kidding with this dishonest response?\n You HAVE reduced my comments to a series of biased abstractions repeatedly.\n When you claim I am \"taking away people's rights to determine what they believe\", that is you reducing what I have said to not only a biased abstraction, but a false one.\n \n I can't take away a right you never had in the first place...\n \n \n \nYou destroy what makes this country great in order to gain acceptance through force, since you cannot gain it by merit.\n\n Discrimination against gays has never made this country great.\n Respecting equal rights IS one of the things that makes this country great.\n \n \n \nWRT \"twisting\" the real twisting is you pretending to be an advocate for democracy and rights, while using undemocratic methods to take away people's rights.\n\n You don't have a right to vote to take people's rights away.\n I can't take away what you never had.\n \n \n \nIt is truly sad the lengths that you would go to, to be accepted.\n\n This has nothing to do with being accepted.\n Just cause gay marriage is legal doesn't mean anybody \"accepts\" us.\n \n \n \nI showed how what you said was merely a series of meaningless dirty debate tactics, refuting all of it. I can hardly call it a refutation though, since there was hardly any substance to refute, mainly bad logic and debate tactics.\n\n And another area where you imposed biased abstraction...\n And despite what you may believe, just saying \"bad logic and debate tactics\" does NOT refute anything.\n You should SHOW WHERE the logic was bad.\n WHAT \"debate tactic\" was used? Ad hominem? False summary? Strawman?\n Oh wait. Those are yours...\n \n You claimed \"poisoning the well\", but you don't understand what that phrase means. Just cause an analogy shows the flaw in somebody else's thinking doesn't mean it is \"poisoning the well\".\n I could rewrite that analogy for the abstract, including \"Attribute X\" and \"Action Y\", and it wouldn't change the analogy.\n \n \n \nI totally agree that denying people rights to decide what words in the English language mean, and what values people will have is wrong.\n\n Repeatedly, you fail to listen.\n Gay marriage is legal in Massachusetts.\n Does ANYBODY there have to change their \"values\" on whether or not gay marriage is wrong???\n \n \n \nYour comment here is hypocritical as you accuse me of copying what you say, while at the same time copying how I have identified your dirty debate tactics.\n\n You fail to recognize what I said.\n I am saying it is pointless to JUST repeat what I said, and say nothing to argue against it.\n \n I am repeating your point, then REFUTING it.\n For some reason, you JUST repeated my point and failed to refute it at all.\n \n \n \nYou mention racism and you talk about racism, and it's still completely irrelevant to the gay marriage issue. You continue to employ the \"poisoning the well\" dirty debate tactic.\n\n You seriously don't know what \"poisoning the well\" means...\n \n Fallacy: Poisoning the WellThis sort of \"reasoning\" involves trying to discredit what a person might later claim by presenting unfavorable information (be it true or false) about the person. This \"argument\" has the following form:\n \n 1. Unfavorable information (be it true or false) about person A is presented.\n 2. Therefore any claims person A makes will be false. \n \n \nI don't care what you think about my beliefs and I don't care how you live your life.\n\n That is blatantly false.\n If you didn't care how I lived my life, you wouldn't try to limit me as I get married to my same sex partner.\n People like you wouldn't try to limit my right to adopt or to serve in the military.\n \n Limiting rights, and your insistence that YOU have to have the capability to limit my rights, is entirely about \"caring how I live my life\".\n \n \n \nYou are the one who is telling people how to live their lives by way of the government, not me.\n\n And that is false as well.\n Suppose gay marriage was legal in your state tomorrow.\n HOW would your life change between today, and tomorrow???\n \n Truth is, it wouldn't.\n \n \n \nI'd be in favor of the government taking no more action at all on this. Just stop all government policies regarding gays from ever being passed again. Can you say the same?\n\n What are you really asking for here?\n Are you asking that ALL government policies regarding gays, including EXISTING ONES be eliminated?\n So the laws that prevent gays from adopting are gone.\n The laws that prevent gays from marrying are gone.\n The laws that prevent gays from serving in the military are gone.\n \n Before I answer your question, I need to know exactly what it is you're asking, so please explain yourself further first.\n \n \n \nAgain, no one cares what you do with your boyfriend in your home. You are the one who cares how people regard gays.\n\n You are very wrong in this regard.\n There is a variety of people who still think sodomy laws should be enforced.\n \n It was only a few years ago when the sodomy laws were repealed, and I saw the news coverage of emotional people (emotional like you) feeling downtrodden because they could not make that illegal.\n \n \n \nSame goes for you.\n\n I have to laugh at this, cause you just showed a statement that says you understand and accept what I said...\n But in your preceding statements, you HABITUALLY REFUSED to agree with that assessment... :xbanghead\n \n You obviously do not understand what was said...\n \n \n \nThat's why I'm not a judge who tries to mold the law into my own personal beliefs. Nor am I politician who tries that. That is what you support, not I.\n\n This statement is so grotesquely false it isn't funny.\n You are a citizen who tries to mold the laws into your own personal beliefs.\n You have REPEATEDLY complained about \"democracy\" being denied because courts rule on rights issues.\n \n The absurd thing you fail to recognize is that in a \"clash of rights\", one right is going to lose. If the courts ALLOWED \"the right to vote\" to overturn people's CIVIL rights, then one right would still be losing out to another. :xbanghead\n \n \n \nEverything you've said here is just sheer hypocrisy. You say that you can't understand why people won't give up their attempts to use the government to change what people believe, yet that is EXACTLY what you are doing.\n\n :xbanghead\n Tell me how ANYTHING I am doing would change ANYTHING you believe in???\n You can't...\n \n \n \nWhy don't you and other gay activists just leave us alone?\n\n You insist on passing laws that limit my life and my rights, yet complain that I need to leave YOU alone?\n Oh. That is RICH!\n \n \n \nWhy must you try to get us to recognize your union and respect it? We don't, so please leave us alone.\n\n Man. This is so laughable it's actually NOT funny.\n You came here to a GAY RIGHTS thread to call gays \"degenerate\", and then you turn around and insist we leave YOU alone as you use your \"right to vote\" to limit the rights of gay people... :xbanghead",

   "That is thoroughly false.\n I believe the people can and should vote on a wide variety of tactics.\n\n \n \"Tactics?\" You consider laws to be \"tactics\"? \n \n \n\n But when it comes to protection of rights, like the rights of blacks or women or Jews or gays, the public should not vote to restrict rights.\n Otherwise, you have the rights of the people subject to the whim of the masses.\n\n \n No one is proposing a vote on restricting the rights of gays. The American people define what the word marriage means for them. Whether or not a union is recognized as the word \"marriage\" and whether or not gays can have all the financial, hereditary, medical, tax benefits of a domestic partnership is an entirely different debate.\n \n \n\n The other really sad part of this is I am talking about the EXISTING system. The one we already have in the U.S.\n For you to declare that as \"Stalinist USSR\" is the height of absurdity!\n \n\n \n No less absurd than your charges of wanting to take away rights. \n \n \n\n Your assessment of my position is a blatant strawman, for which you give no foundation for your assessment.\n I have talked repeatedly of affirming rights.\n \n One cannot debate with a person whereby I say \"It is white\" and the other person insists \"You think it is black\". There is no intelligible discourse there.\n Listen to my words. Respond to my words.\n \n Otherwise, you're talking out of nothing...\n \n\n \n Again, no different than your strawmaning my position. I'm waiting for you to figure out that I'm using the same dirty debate tactics on you every time you use them on me.\n \n \n\n Talk about insistent denial!\n It is entirely relevant, as it shows the purpose and function of the court.\n \n\n \n No, talk about insistent rejection. The mere fact that you repeat yourself does not make you right. Defining the purpose and the function of the court does not mean that the SCOTUS should rule from the bench in your subjective favor.\n \n \n\n I suspect the REAL problem here is that you like the idea of the courts protecting rights for SOME groups, but when it comes to the courts protecting the rights of OTHER groups, you object and think it undemocratic.\n I'm sure racists and xenophobes went through the same thing. They felt it proper to protect the rights of groups they APPROVED of, but when it comes to other groups they objected loudly thinking they had rediscovered that the wheel is round.\n What you fail to recognize is that EVERY issue of discrimination will incur somebody who objects. \n\n \n The real problem is that you are using a standard talking point of gay marriage proponents which is that race = sexual preference. That is obviously false. The color of a person's skin is not the same as who they like to have sex with. What you have been slow to understand is that those are two completely different things and thus, your constant use of that talking point is empty rhetoric.\n \n \n\n Nobody is creating laws here.\n It is enforcing the constitution. Enforcing equal rights.\n\n \n You are breaking equal rights by trying to prevent people from having a say in laws that will affect them. \n \n \n\n You label that as \"propaganda\", ignoring what makes this country great just cause you object loudly to gays... :xbanghead\n\n \n You spout your propaganda because you want to use the government to influence people to be more open to homosexuality, but you don't want to let the people decide if they want to be more open to homosexuality. You want to make this country less great by casting down our democratic values.\n \n \n\n :xbanghead\n You are obviously not listening.\n I am not telling people what is right.\n \n People like you get confused cause you think that \"equal rights\" is about \"what is right and what is wrong\".\n I think Brittany Spears was totally screwed up in her three hour wedding, but it was HER CIVIL RIGHT to get married and divorced like that.\n \n But people like YOU judge civil rights by \"right and wrong\" morality, and YOU attempt to GIVE civil rights based on \"right and wrong\" morality.\n That isn't the way it works in the U.S.\n\n \n You can't hear over the gay marriage talking points that you are yelling about. You are telling people what is right. You are telling people that gay marriage is ok. You are not letting people decide if gay marriage is ok with them. \n \n People like you have problems being accepted in society, so you want to use force on society to get them to accept you. That is why you avoid things like popular referendums. You want to influence society, not let society make up its own mind. Your way is what does not work in the US.\n \n \n\n Over and over again, you refuse to listen to my words. You react haphazardly and quickly, failing to recognize what is really being said.\n I feel no need to change you.\n What I talk about invokes NO POWER to cause you to change.\n That is what you need to realize.\n \n\n \n You are unable to distinguish between your opinion and facts. Your arrogance blinds from being able to see that I am applying the same kind of tactics on your comments, that you have applied on mine. You are so flustered by having your own barbs thrown back in your face that you cannot remain focused on trying to expand your argument beyond your opinions and talking points. \n \n I feel no need to change you either. You are trying to change the people of this country by making them accept homosexuality. You and people like you are a small amount of people who want to tell a vast amount of people what to believe. That is wrong. People should be able to determine what they believe on their own, not have it dictated to them by a small percentage of the population. \n \n \n\n I feel a need to refute the tyrannical prejudice I see where it exists.\n I am responding to your words.\n That is the point.\n\n \n It's sad when a person can't even be consistent with his own vitriol. If you feel the need to reply to me, then that's inconsistent with you saying you feel no need to engage me. If you're going to be arrogant and nasty, please at least try to be consistent with your own arrogance and nastiness. That's not asking too much.\n \n With regards to \"tyrannical prejudice\" that is exactly what you are pushing for, the tyranny of a handful of extremists telling hundreds of millions of people where it exists. If you truly believed in refuting tyrannical prejudice, then you would allow people to make their own policies. \n \n \n\n I have imposed no \"dirty debate tactics\".\n You not liking what I say is not \"dirty debate tactics\".\n \n If you want a REAL \"dirty debate tactic\", then look in the mirror when you misrepresent what I have said.\n\n \n You have tried \"poisoning the well\" dirty debate tactics and you have consistently misrepresented what I have said. There are other things you have tried, but I'm not going to go back looking for them. I do use your own tactics on you when you use them on, however you are so closed-minded and irrational that you don't even recognize your own tactics when they are being used on you.\n \n \n\n I urge you to THINK about what you just said...\n After all, YOU are talking about \"taking away people's rights\".\n \n And I have in no way made any effort to \"determine what you believe\".\n If you had more honesty and insight, you could recognize that you can STILL believe what you want even with gay marriage legal.\n \n\n \n I urge you to follow your own advice. You are talking about taking away people's rights. We have the right to decide what we want to consider marriage. It is not the right of a small fraction of the population to define marriage. That's our right. People can believe what they want before and after you make the government set a policy, but that doesn't change that it is the people who should be making the policy. Instead of trying to talk up \n how your undemocratic methods would still allow some freedoms, you would be less of a coward if you simply admitted that you believe so passionately in your cause that you don't care how you get it accomplished. Unfortunately, you do not have the honesty to admit this, nor the intelligence to analyze the talking points you repeat.\n \n \n\n Your reply is meaningless.\n When courts look at issues, they look at the ABSTRACT of the issue. Is free speech involved. How does the 14th amendment apply. etc, etc...\n \n And who do you think you are kidding with this dishonest response?\n You HAVE reduced my comments to a series of biased abstractions repeatedly.\n When you claim I am \"taking away people's rights to determine what they believe\", that is you reducing what I have said to not only a biased abstraction, but a false one.\n \n I can't take away a right you never had in the first place...\n\n \n Your reply is meaningless. Now you're just copying what I'm saying and saying it back to me. You apply a spin on my comments and then make comments on what you've spun my comments into. That is meaningless, which was the point.\n \n WRT the courts, the courts look at the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Your spin is not in anyway the same thing courts do.\n \n You completely fail to see my point. If you consider my argument a biased abstraction, then your argument is also a biased abstraction. You can't even see your own hypocrisy. \n \n You can't even see how perfectly your own comment applies to you're position of so-called gay rights:\n \n \"I can't take away a right you never had in the first place...\"\n \n \n \n\n Discrimination against gays has never made this country great.\n Respecting equal rights IS one of the things that makes this country great.\n \n\n \n You're the only one proposing discrimination. Discrimination in favor of a small percentage of people to determine the beliefs of the vast majority. That is a trampling of democracy and equal rights and it makes our country less great.\n \n \n\n You don't have a right to vote to take people's rights away.\n I can't take away what you never had.\n \n\n \n Neither do you. You don't have a right to use the government to influence what people believe without the people's consent. You believe that only people who think like you do have the right to set government policy and that right is what you are trying to take away.\n \n \n\n This has nothing to do with being accepted.\n Just cause gay marriage is legal doesn't mean anybody \"accepts\" us.\n \n\n \n It's about being accepted. Legalizing gay marriage is about achieving a status that tells people that homosexuality is ok. People are free to make up their own minds if homosexuality is ok or not, they don't need you using courts or state capitals to make that decision for them.\n \n \n\n And another area where you imposed biased abstraction...\n And despite what you may believe, just saying \"bad logic and debate tactics\" does NOT refute anything.\n You should SHOW WHERE the logic was bad.\n WHAT \"debate tactic\" was used? Ad hominem? False summary? Strawman?\n Oh wait. Those are yours...\n \n You claimed \"poisoning the well\", but you don't understand what that phrase means. Just cause an analogy shows the flaw in somebody else's thinking doesn't mean it is \"poisoning the well\".\n I could rewrite that analogy for the abstract, including \"Attribute X\" and \"Action Y\", and it wouldn't change the analogy.\n\n \n Firstly, biased abstraction is your tactic. Secondly, you were arguing that all abstraction is good. You said how the SCOTUS used abstraction to make its rulings. In your dishonest attempt to use debate tactics you are conflicting with your own comments. I don't just say that your tactics are bad, I've pointed out every time and every place where you've used them. If you want to read them, then maybe you should stop ignoring those tactics, but then you'd have to stop lying and it's obvious that you couldn't do that. \n \n You don't understand how to debate honestly. You used poisoning the well tactics by bringing up irrelevant topics (i.e. racism) in this topic (gay marriage). You're not showing any flaws in arguments but your own. You can make any abstraction you want and I can make the argument even more abstract. Just resting your argument upon a completely random point of abstraction is not a logical argument. \n \n \n\n Repeatedly, you fail to listen.\n Gay marriage is legal in Massachusetts.\n Does ANYBODY there have to change their \"values\" on whether or not gay marriage is wrong???\n\n \n You fail to appreciate democratic values and you place your opinion over other people's rights to determine their own opinions. Nobody has to change their beliefs on gay marriage in MA. The government is still changing them by granting them the status of marriage. It's also likely that this will lead to changes in education as well, teaching kids about gay marriage. \n \n \n\n You fail to recognize what I said.\n I am saying it is pointless to JUST repeat what I said, and say nothing to argue against it.\n \n I am repeating your point, then REFUTING it.\n For some reason, you JUST repeated my point and failed to refute it at all.\n \n\n \n You fail to be consistent with what you say. You copy what I say and then accuse me of copying what you say. You want to take away people's rights to determine their beliefs and then accuse gay marriage opponents of taking away rights. You imply that reducing everything to the abstract is always right and then say that there can be \"dishonest abstraction.\"\n \n \n\n You seriously don't know what \"poisoning the well\" means...\n \n Fallacy: Poisoning the WellThis sort of \"reasoning\" involves trying to discredit what a person might later claim by presenting unfavorable information (be it true or false) about the person. This \"argument\" has the following form:\n \n 1. Unfavorable information (be it true or false) about person A is presented.\n 2. Therefore any claims person A makes will be false. \n\n \n Poisoning the well might not be an exact fit to your attempt to bring racism into this, as that is your assertion and not factual, but your bringing racism into this is still a logical fallacy, despite your inability to be honest about that.\n \n \n\n That is blatantly false.\n If you didn't care how I lived my life, you wouldn't try to limit me as I get married to my same sex partner.\n People like you wouldn't try to limit my right to adopt or to serve in the military.\n \n Limiting rights, and your insistence that YOU have to have the capability to limit my rights, is entirely about \"caring how I live my life\".\n \n\n \n Nope, you're just blatantly dishonest. I don't care how you life your life, period. No amount of your argument is going to change that. As long as people like you don't try to enact your desires on children or other illegal ways, then that's your business.\n \n Again, what you continue to ignore is what I actually object to: your attempting to affect the beliefs of the American people instead of letting them decide what they want to believe in.\n \n \n\n And that is false as well.\n Suppose gay marriage was legal in your state tomorrow.\n HOW would your life change between today, and tomorrow???\n \n Truth is, it wouldn't.\n \n\n \n I know it's news to you, but things are not false are true just because you say so. How my life would change if gay marriage is irrelevant. While you view this entire issues as about you, I don't view the issue as about me or you, but about the rights of American citizens as a whole. \n \n \n\n What are you really asking for here?\n Are you asking that ALL government policies regarding gays, including EXISTING ONES be eliminated?\n So the laws that prevent gays from adopting are gone.\n The laws that prevent gays from marrying are gone.\n The laws that prevent gays from serving in the military are gone.\n \n Before I answer your question, I need to know exactly what it is you're asking, so please explain yourself further first.\n \n\n \n I'm really asking what I really said. You choose not to really answer. \n \n \"Just stop all government policies regarding gays from ever being passed again. Can you say the same?\"\n \n I think words like stop are pretty simple. Maybe I should say \"no more.\" Make no more policies regarding gays. Everything stops the way it is right now. That would be fine with me. \n \n \n\n You are very wrong in this regard.\n There is a variety of people who still think sodomy laws should be enforced.\n \n It was only a few years ago when the sodomy laws were repealed, and I saw the news coverage of emotional people (emotional like you) feeling downtrodden because they could not make that illegal.\n \n\n \n You again confuse your opinion for facts. A handful of people care about what you do. There's always a handful of people who care about anything, just like the handful of people who are so mentally unstable by how society views them (like you) that they want to tell society what to believe. I do not care how you live your life, neither do the vast majority of people. You are egocentric enough to believe that everyone wants to know what you're doing.\n \n \n\n I have to laugh at this, cause you just showed a statement that says you understand and accept what I said...\n But in your preceding statements, you HABITUALLY REFUSED to agree with that assessment... :xbanghead\n \n You obviously do not understand what was said...\n \n\n \n That's cool, you can laugh like a lunatic all you want. Not surprising. You don't specifically back up any of your claims because that is typical of your deceit and immaturity. Carry on.\n \n \n\n This statement is so grotesquely false it isn't funny.\n You are a citizen who tries to mold the laws into your own personal beliefs.\n You have REPEATEDLY complained about \"democracy\" being denied because courts rule on rights issues.\n \n The absurd thing you fail to recognize is that in a \"clash of rights\", one right is going to lose. If the courts ALLOWED \"the right to vote\" to overturn people's CIVIL rights, then one right would still be losing out to another. :xbanghead\n\n \n Your comment here is again the same pattern of dishonesty and hypocrisy that you've exhibited throughout your posts. You are doing exactly what you accuse other people of: trying to mold the laws into your own personal beliefs of accepting gay marriage. My position is simple: let the people decide.\n \n I'm glad that you've finally admitted that vote by plebiscite in this case is a right. Are you going to take that back now? \n \n \n\n :xbanghead\n Tell me how ANYTHING I am doing would change ANYTHING you believe in???\n You can't...\n\n \n Well firstly you misrepresent my comments. I said you will change what \"people\" believe, not what I believe. Secondly, calling gay union a \"marriage\" would influence young people to believe that being gay is ok. I prefer letting people make up their own minds without any badges of honor or shame for gay couples. \n \n \n\n You insist on passing laws that limit my life and my rights, yet complain that I need to leave YOU alone?\n Oh. That is RICH!\n \n\n \n My comments aren't rich, yours are dishonest. I favor domestic partnerships backed up with a provision that any decision to decide over the word marriage be done so by popular vote. Domestic partnerships include laws that do not limit your life and rights, so you just lied.\n \n \n\n Man. This is so laughable it's actually NOT funny.\n You came here to a GAY RIGHTS thread to call gays \"degenerate\", and then you turn around and insist we leave YOU alone as you use your \"right to vote\" to limit the rights of gay people... :xbanghead\n\n \n Well you keep on laughing like a lunatic. I'm sure that's usual for you. It's also typically dishonest how you only show half of the facts. You show my disparaging remarks, but not those of people who share the same far left positions that you do. \n \n So typical. Go bang that head some more.",

   "You know, I haven't been following the threads the last few days. I've caught up on many of Roesgen's posts. I hadn't realized how much they proved my recent reply on this thread to Archangel.\n \n There is so much insecurity in Roesgen's posts. He fears people can be made gay, and this would be a bad thing. That's because homosexuality is said to be disgusting, etc. Any sexual act, gay or straight, is ugly, in abstract terms.\n \n And again, as has been argued by opponents, civil unions are ok in their view, but not marriage. Yet people are doing the same things in marriage as in civil unions. What the issue really is for gay opponents, is the fact that they don't want acceptance on par with heterosexuality. They believe heterosexuality, is threatened by homosexuality.\n\n \n Well that's your own warped view, that anyone who opposes gay marriage is afraid. If you are interested in making this personal, instead of just discussing the issue, I would say that saddened is a more appropriate word for describing how I view gay marriage's passage by judges and state capitals. You on the other hand are so insecure that you need other people to tell you that being gay is alright. You are so hurt by your rejection in society that you want to trample over essential democratic rights in this country just to feel better about yourself. I pity you.\n \n Regardless, I support a domestic partnerships law, as has been done in Washington State, with the provision that any future labeling of gay unions as \"marriage\" be decided by popular vote.",

Bigotry is not unlike what justice Marshall is reputed to have said about porn: 'I can't define it but I know it when I see it.'

It makes it much more difficult for you to paint any objection whatsoever in such a broad brush. \n\n \n You demonstrate your lack of intelligence by supporting a debate where only gay marriage supporters are allowed to use insults. My beliefs are in no way bigoted. You define bigotry as disagreement. I disagree with gay marriage initiated by a judge or a state capital and that is no bigotry.

I view it the same way you might view a man and a goat ####ing each other up the XXX and then calling that marriage. \n\n \n So as a conservative...you believe in having someone else decide for you what kind of sex you can have in the privacy of your home? Wow, maybe I'm not conservative after all. Some Jews think pork is disgusting...would you support them banning you from eating pork? I'm not saying you can't think what you want about whatever you want (I personally think drinking blood and eating dead flesh is creepy but would never attempt to enjoin a christian from doing so)...but you cross the line when you attempt to deny someone liberty when it doesn't effect you.\n \n \nI never said that it would \"impose\" on me or \"diminish\" my life. It would diminish the people who fall prey to behave in such a way and thus basically diminish us as a society, just as an individual might not necessarily be diminished by another man married to a goat, but we as as a society would be less if we had such unions. It would make our society less if we taught in classrooms that people and animals should marry each other. We would be a less respectable society, and in that way be diminished. \n\n \n I believe organized religion increases ignorance and represses progress but I'll not infringe your right to believe what YOU want and attend whatever church YOU want. Placing arbitrary restraints on private behavior (or ideas or other's beliefs) based on personal religious beliefs flies in the face of everything this country stands for. And stop bringing up ANIMALS...animals are different from PEOPLE, even the bible got that right.\n \n \nAs for what would make people happy, many things would make people happy. Legalized prostitution would make people happy, legalized drugs would make people happy, polygamy would make people happy, bestiality would make some people happy, however this is immoral behavior. I would rather that my government did not promote immoral behavior. I would rather that my government would not punish people who oppose immoral behavior. It is worth my time and energy to fight this immorality and immorality backed by government because morality means something to me, and I don't like to see morality destroyed.\n\n \n Promoting Behaviors and preventing liberties are two totally different things. An argument could be made that drugs effect the entire society just as selling poison or mislabeled medicine could...but saying \"these two people can get married but these can't\" is not what freedom is all about. Blue Laws tell me I can't shop on Sunday because someone ELSE thinks I should be attending Christian church (Jews go Sat and Muslims on SUN, should we give up half the week?). You can believe what you want and there's nothing wrong with that...until you IMPOSE these beliefs on others.",

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/opinion/19Rich.html?_r=2&ref=opinion\nWHAT would happen if you crossed that creepy 1960s horror classic \"The Village of the Damned\" with the Broadway staple \"A Chorus Line\"? You don't need to use your imagination. It's there waiting for you on YouTube under the title \"Gathering Storm\": a 60-second ad presenting homosexuality as a national threat second only to terrorism. \n \n The actors are supposedly Not Gay. They stand in choral formation before a backdrop of menacing clouds and cheesy lightning effects. \"The winds are strong,\" says a white man to the accompaniment of ominous music. \"And I am afraid,\" a young black woman chimes in. \"Those advocates want to change the way I live,\" says a white woman. But just when all seems lost, the sun breaks through and a smiling black man announces that \"a rainbow coalition\" is \"coming together in love\" to save America from the apocalypse of same-sex marriage. It's the swiftest rescue of Western civilization since the heyday of the ambiguously gay duo Batman and Robin.\n \n Far from terrifying anyone, \"Gathering Storm\" has become, unsurprisingly, an Internet camp classic. On YouTube the original video must compete with countless homemade parodies it has inspired since first turning up some 10 days ago. None may top Stephen Colbert's on Thursday night, in which lightning from \"the homo storm\" strikes an Arkansas teacher, turning him gay. A \"New Jersey pastor\" whose church has been \"turned into an Abercrombie & Fitch\" declares that he likes gay people, \"but only as hilarious best friends in TV and movies.\"\n \n Yet easy to mock as \"Gathering Storm\" may be, it nonetheless bookmarks a historic turning point in the demise of America's anti-gay movement.\n \n What gives the ad its symbolic significance is not just that it's idiotic but that its release was the only loud protest anywhere in America to the news that same-sex marriage had been legalized in Iowa and Vermont. If it advances any message, it's mainly that homophobic activism is ever more depopulated and isolated as well as brain-dead. \n \n \"Gathering Storm\" was produced and broadcast - for a claimed $1.5 million - by an outfit called the National Organization for Marriage. This \"national organization,\" formed in 2007, is a fund-raising and propaganda-spewing Web site fronted by the right-wing Princeton University professor Robert George and the columnist Maggie Gallagher, who was famously caught receiving taxpayers' money to promote Bush administration \"marriage initiatives.\" Until last month, half of the six board members (including George) had some past or present affiliation with Princeton's James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions. (One of them, the son of one of the 12 apostles in the Mormon church hierarchy, recently stepped down.)\n \n Even the anti-Obama \"tea parties\" flogged by Fox News last week had wider genuine grass-roots support than this so-called national organization. Beyond Princeton, most straight citizens merely shrugged as gay families celebrated in Iowa and Vermont. There was no mass backlash. At ABC and CBS, the Vermont headlines didn't even make the evening news.\n \n On the right, the restrained response was striking. Fox barely mentioned the subject; its rising-star demagogue, Glenn Beck, while still dismissing same-sex marriage, went so far as to \"celebrate what happened in Vermont\" because \"instead of the courts making a decision, the people did.\" Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the self-help media star once notorious for portraying homosexuality as \"a biological error\" and a gateway to pedophilia, told CNN's Larry King that she now views committed gay relationships as \"a beautiful thing and a healthy thing.\" In The New York Post, the invariably witty and invariably conservative writer Kyle Smith demolished a Maggie Gallagher screed published in National Review and wondered whether her errant arguments against gay equality were \"something else in disguise.\"\n \n More startling still was the abrupt about-face of the Rev. Rick Warren, the hugely popular megachurch leader whose endorsement last year of Proposition 8, California's same-sex marriage ban, had roiled his appearance at the Obama inaugural. Warren also dropped in on Larry King to declare that he had \"never\" been and \"never will be\" an \"anti-gay-marriage activist.\" This was an unmistakable slap at the National Organization for Marriage, which lavished far more money on Proposition 8 than even James Dobson's Focus on the Family. \n \n The Obamas' dog had longer legs on cable than the news from Iowa and Vermont. CNN's weekly press critique, \"Reliable Sources,\" inquired why. The gay blogger John Aravosis suggested that many Americans are more worried about their mortgages than their neighbors' private lives. Besides, Aravosis said, there are \"only so many news stories you can do showing guys in tuxes.\" \n \n As the polls attest, the majority of Americans who support civil unions for gay couples has been steadily growing. Younger voters are fine with marriage. Generational changeover will seal the deal. Crunching all the numbers, the poll maven Nate Silver sees same-sex marriage achieving majority support \"at some point in the 2010s.\" \n \n Iowa and Vermont were the tipping point because they struck down the right's two major arguments against marriage equality. The unanimous ruling of the seven-member Iowa Supreme Court proved that the issue is not merely a bicoastal fad. The decision, written by Mark Cady, a Republican appointee, was particularly articulate in explaining that a state's legalization of same-sex marriage has no effect on marriage as practiced by religions. \"The only difference,\" the judge wrote, is that \"civil marriage will now take on a new meaning that reflects a more complete understanding of equal protection of the law.\"\n \n Some opponents grumbled anyway, reviving their perennial complaint, dating back to Brown v. Board of Education, about activist judges. But the judiciary has long played a leading role in sticking up for the civil rights of minorities so they're not held hostage to a majority vote. Even if the judiciary-overreach argument had merit, it was still moot in Vermont, where the State Legislature, not a court, voted to make same-sex marriage legal and then voted to override the Republican governor's veto. \n \n As the case against equal rights for gay families gets harder and harder to argue on any nonreligious or legal grounds, no wonder so many conservatives are dropping the cause. And if Fox News and Rick Warren won't lead the charge on same-sex marriage, who on the national stage will take their place? The only enthusiastic contenders seem to be Republicans contemplating presidential runs in 2012. As Rich Tafel, the former president of the gay Log Cabin Republicans, pointed out to me last week, what Iowa giveth to the Democrats, Iowa taketh away from his own party. As the first stop in the primary process, the Iowa caucuses provided a crucial boost to Barack Obama's victorious and inclusive Democratic campaign in 2008. But on the G.O.P. side, the caucuses tilt toward the exclusionary hard right. \n \n In 2008, 60 percent of Iowa's Republican caucus voters were evangelical Christians. Mike Huckabee won. That's the hurdle facing the party's contenders in 2012, which is why Romney, Palin and Gingrich are now all more vehement anti-same-sex-marriage activists than Rick Warren. Palin even broke with John McCain on the issue during their campaign, supporting the federal marriage amendment that he rejects. This month, even as the father of Palin's out-of-wedlock grandson challenged her own family values and veracity, she nominated as Alaskan attorney general a man who has called gay people \"degenerates.\" Such homophobia didn't even play in Alaska - the State Legislature voted the nominee down - and will doom Republicans like Palin in national elections. \n \n One G.O.P. politician who understands this is the McCain-Palin 2008 campaign strategist, Steve Schmidt, who on Friday urged his party to join him in endorsing same-sex marriage. Another is Jon Huntsman Jr., the governor of Utah, who in February endorsed civil unions for gay couples, a position seemingly indistinguishable from Obama's. Huntsman is not some left-coast Hollywood Republican. He's a Mormon presiding over what Gallup ranks as the reddest state in the country.\n \n \"We must embrace all citizens as equals,\" Huntsman told me in an interview last week. \"I've always stood tall on this.\" Has he been hurt by his position? Not remotely. \"A lot of people gave the issue more scrutiny after it became the topic of the week,\" he said, and started to see it \"in human terms.\" Letters, calls, polls and conversations with voters around the state all confirmed to him that opinion has \"shifted quite substantially\" toward his point of view. Huntsman's approval rating now stands at 84 percent.\n \n He believes that social issues should not be a priority for Republicans in any case during an economic crisis. He also is an outspoken foe of the \"nativist language\" that has marked the G.O.P. of late. Huntsman doesn't share \"the view of some\" that \"the party was created in 1980.\" He yearns for it to reclaim Lincoln's faith in \"individual dignity.\" \n \n As marital equality haltingly but inexorably spreads state by state for gay Americans in the years to come, Utah will hardly be in the lead to follow Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa and Vermont. But the fact that it too is taking its first steps down that road is extraordinary. It is justice, not a storm, that is gathering. Only those who have spread the poisons of bigotry and fear have any reason to be afraid.\n",

He falsely identified me as a Christian evangelical, when I belong to no religious denomination. You also misidentify me as a conservative. I'm conservative on some issues and liberal on others. If you call completely misunderstanding your opponent to be \"having\" them, then your obviously not reading the situation correctly. I suggest you take your own advice: \"take a breath and think....THINK\". \n \n Again, if you would breath and think, and actually read what I'm saying instead of just ignoring what I'm saying and repeating gay marriage talking points, maybe you would understand what I'm saying. You say I want to expand the power of the government. I don't. You want to expand the power of the government by having the government attempt to change the attitudes of people about gay marriage. I say let people articulate their own beliefs about gay marriage instead. That is the path of lesser government on this issue.",

I don't want my government influencing people because the far left wants to do that. You're fundamentally saying that your opinion counts more than mine. You're implying that it's ok for you to ask the government to influence people and that I am not entitled to disagree with that.

If you teach someone something, then they believe it. You can teach people to believe in anything and behave in nearly anyway. Human behavior is modifiable, especially young people. That's why philosophers refer to people as tabula rasa or \"blank slates\".

The original definition of marriage, was decided by a court. It's still being defined by courts, as more recent cases in favour of same-sex marriage in Canada and the U.S., demonstrate. \n \n\n \n Feel free to post a source.\n \n \n\n Yes, gays are a minority. Our homosexuality is fundamental to what makes us human in terms of sexuality. Marriage has already been deemed a right, which means nothing, if one can't marry of one's choice.\n\n \n Gays are not a minority. No moreso than people who do sexting are a minority. Your sexuality is in no way being denied to you. Where has marriage been deemed a right?",

   "\n So as a conservative...you believe in having someone else decide for you what kind of sex you can have in the privacy of your home? Wow, maybe I'm not conservative after all. \n\n \n Maybe you just jump to bad conclusions instead of reading what people are saying? I'm not \"a conservative\". I'm not into labels. I have some conservative beliefs and some beliefs that are called liberal. \n \n Already answered your question about the gov't and sex moments ago.\n \n \n\n Some Jews think pork is disgusting...would you support them banning you from eating pork? \n\n \n Nope. To use your analogy, I'm not trying to ban people from having gay sex. Your analogy failed.\n \n \n\n I'm not saying you can't think what you want about whatever you want (I personally think drinking blood and eating dead flesh is creepy but would never attempt to enjoin a christian from doing so)...but you cross the line when you attempt to deny someone liberty when it doesn't effect you.\n \n\n \n Again, not trying to deny gay people from having gay sex. I'm not attempting to deny anyone their liberty. You constantly jump to bad conclusions, reading things into my comments which are not there.\n \n \n\n I believe organized religion increases ignorance and represses progress but I'll not infringe your right to believe what YOU want and attend whatever church YOU want. Placing arbitrary restraints on private behavior (or ideas or other's beliefs) based on personal religious beliefs flies in the face of everything this country stands for. And stop bringing up ANIMALS...animals are different from PEOPLE, even the bible got that right.\n\n \n Again, you automatically assume that this is about religion for me. It's not. I'm not a Christian, Jew, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Shintoist, or any other denomination. You've overlooked what I've actually said about allowing the public to decide what marriage means and jumped straight into believing things that I've never said about religion. \n \n \n\n Promoting Behaviors and preventing liberties are two totally different things. An argument could be made that drugs effect the entire society just as selling poison or mislabeled medicine could...but saying \"these two people can get married but these can't\" is not what freedom is all about. Blue Laws tell me I can't shop on Sunday because someone ELSE thinks I should be attending Christian church (Jews go Sat and Muslims on SUN, should we give up half the week?). You can believe what you want and there's nothing wrong with that...until you IMPOSE these beliefs on others.\n\n \n OK, let me clear that up for you. I want the government not to promote or discourage gay behavior, nor do I want it to prevent those liberties. Breath and think, CUNx, breath and think. \n \n I think that people should be allowed to have unions and that what those unions mean to people are up to them. If the people of one state want to call it marriage, so be it. If the people of another state want to call it domestic partnership, so be it. \n \n I agree that the state should not be trying to impose beliefs on others either for or against gay behavior.",

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/opinion/19Rich.html?_r=2&ref=opinion\n \n WHAT would happen if you crossed that creepy 1960s horror classic \"The Village of the Damned\" with the Broadway staple \"A Chorus Line\"? You don't need to use your imagination. It's there waiting for you on YouTube under the title \"Gathering Storm\": a 60-second ad presenting homosexuality as a national threat second only to terrorism.\n \n The actors are supposedly Not Gay. They stand in choral formation before a backdrop of menacing clouds and cheesy lightning effects. \"The winds are strong,\" says a white man to the accompaniment of ominous music. \"And I am afraid,\" a young black woman chimes in. \"Those advocates want to change the way I live,\" says a white woman. But just when all seems lost, the sun breaks through and a smiling black man announces that \"a rainbow coalition\" is \"coming together in love\" to save America from the apocalypse of same-sex marriage. It's the swiftest rescue of Western civilization since the heyday of the ambiguously gay duo Batman and Robin.\n \n Far from terrifying anyone, \"Gathering Storm\" has become, unsurprisingly, an Internet camp classic. On YouTube the original video must compete with countless homemade parodies it has inspired since first turning up some 10 days ago. None may top Stephen Colbert's on Thursday night, in which lightning from \"the homo storm\" strikes an Arkansas teacher, turning him gay. A \"New Jersey pastor\" whose church has been \"turned into an Abercrombie & Fitch\" declares that he likes gay people, \"but only as hilarious best friends in TV and movies.\"\n \n Yet easy to mock as \"Gathering Storm\" may be, it nonetheless bookmarks a historic turning point in the demise of America's anti-gay movement.\n \n What gives the ad its symbolic significance is not just that it's idiotic but that its release was the only loud protest anywhere in America to the news that same-sex marriage had been legalized in Iowa and Vermont. If it advances any message, it's mainly that homophobic activism is ever more depopulated and isolated as well as brain-dead.\n \n \"Gathering Storm\" was produced and broadcast - for a claimed $1.5 million - by an outfit called the National Organization for Marriage. This \"national organization,\" formed in 2007, is a fund-raising and propaganda-spewing Web site fronted by the right-wing Princeton University professor Robert George and the columnist Maggie Gallagher, who was famously caught receiving taxpayers' money to promote Bush administration \"marriage initiatives.\" Until last month, half of the six board members (including George) had some past or present affiliation with Princeton's James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions. (One of them, the son of one of the 12 apostles in the Mormon church hierarchy, recently stepped down.)\n \n Even the anti-Obama \"tea parties\" flogged by Fox News last week had wider genuine grass-roots support than this so-called national organization. Beyond Princeton, most straight citizens merely shrugged as gay families celebrated in Iowa and Vermont. There was no mass backlash. At ABC and CBS, the Vermont headlines didn't even make the evening news.\n \n On the right, the restrained response was striking. Fox barely mentioned the subject; its rising-star demagogue, Glenn Beck, while still dismissing same-sex marriage, went so far as to \"celebrate what happened in Vermont\" because \"instead of the courts making a decision, the people did.\" Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the self-help media star once notorious for portraying homosexuality as \"a biological error\" and a gateway to pedophilia, told CNN's Larry King that she now views committed gay relationships as \"a beautiful thing and a healthy thing.\" In The New York Post, the invariably witty and invariably conservative writer Kyle Smith demolished a Maggie Gallagher screed published in National Review and wondered whether her errant arguments against gay equality were \"something else in disguise.\"\n \n More startling still was the abrupt about-face of the Rev. Rick Warren, the hugely popular megachurch leader whose endorsement last year of Proposition 8, California's same-sex marriage ban, had roiled his appearance at the Obama inaugural. Warren also dropped in on Larry King to declare that he had \"never\" been and \"never will be\" an \"anti-gay-marriage activist.\" This was an unmistakable slap at the National Organization for Marriage, which lavished far more money on Proposition 8 than even James Dobson's Focus on the Family.\n \n The Obamas' dog had longer legs on cable than the news from Iowa and Vermont. CNN's weekly press critique, \"Reliable Sources,\" inquired why. The gay blogger John Aravosis suggested that many Americans are more worried about their mortgages than their neighbors' private lives. Besides, Aravosis said, there are \"only so many news stories you can do showing guys in tuxes.\"\n \n As the polls attest, the majority of Americans who support civil unions for gay couples has been steadily growing. Younger voters are fine with marriage. Generational changeover will seal the deal. Crunching all the numbers, the poll maven Nate Silver sees same-sex marriage achieving majority support \"at some point in the 2010s.\"\n \n Iowa and Vermont were the tipping point because they struck down the right's two major arguments against marriage equality. The unanimous ruling of the seven-member Iowa Supreme Court proved that the issue is not merely a bicoastal fad. The decision, written by Mark Cady, a Republican appointee, was particularly articulate in explaining that a state's legalization of same-sex marriage has no effect on marriage as practiced by religions. \"The only difference,\" the judge wrote, is that \"civil marriage will now take on a new meaning that reflects a more complete understanding of equal protection of the law.\"\n \n Some opponents grumbled anyway, reviving their perennial complaint, dating back to Brown v. Board of Education, about activist judges. But the judiciary has long played a leading role in sticking up for the civil rights of minorities so they're not held hostage to a majority vote. Even if the judiciary-overreach argument had merit, it was still moot in Vermont, where the State Legislature, not a court, voted to make same-sex marriage legal and then voted to override the Republican governor's veto.\n \n As the case against equal rights for gay families gets harder and harder to argue on any nonreligious or legal grounds, no wonder so many conservatives are dropping the cause. And if Fox News and Rick Warren won't lead the charge on same-sex marriage, who on the national stage will take their place? The only enthusiastic contenders seem to be Republicans contemplating presidential runs in 2012. As Rich Tafel, the former president of the gay Log Cabin Republicans, pointed out to me last week, what Iowa giveth to the Democrats, Iowa taketh away from his own party. As the first stop in the primary process, the Iowa caucuses provided a crucial boost to Barack Obama's victorious and inclusive Democratic campaign in 2008. But on the G.O.P. side, the caucuses tilt toward the exclusionary hard right.\n \n In 2008, 60 percent of Iowa's Republican caucus voters were evangelical Christians. Mike Huckabee won. That's the hurdle facing the party's contenders in 2012, which is why Romney, Palin and Gingrich are now all more vehement anti-same-sex-marriage activists than Rick Warren. Palin even broke with John McCain on the issue during their campaign, supporting the federal marriage amendment that he rejects. This month, even as the father of Palin's out-of-wedlock grandson challenged her own family values and veracity, she nominated as Alaskan attorney general a man who has called gay people \"degenerates.\" Such homophobia didn't even play in Alaska - the State Legislature voted the nominee down - and will doom Republicans like Palin in national elections.\n \n One G.O.P. politician who understands this is the McCain-Palin 2008 campaign strategist, Steve Schmidt, who on Friday urged his party to join him in endorsing same-sex marriage. Another is Jon Huntsman Jr., the governor of Utah, who in February endorsed civil unions for gay couples, a position seemingly indistinguishable from Obama's. Huntsman is not some left-coast Hollywood Republican. He's a Mormon presiding over what Gallup ranks as the reddest state in the country.\n \n \"We must embrace all citizens as equals,\" Huntsman told me in an interview last week. \"I've always stood tall on this.\" Has he been hurt by his position? Not remotely. \"A lot of people gave the issue more scrutiny after it became the topic of the week,\" he said, and started to see it \"in human terms.\" Letters, calls, polls and conversations with voters around the state all confirmed to him that opinion has \"shifted quite substantially\" toward his point of view. Huntsman's approval rating now stands at 84 percent.\n \n He believes that social issues should not be a priority for Republicans in any case during an economic crisis. He also is an outspoken foe of the \"nativist language\" that has marked the G.O.P. of late. Huntsman doesn't share \"the view of some\" that \"the party was created in 1980.\" He yearns for it to reclaim Lincoln's faith in \"individual dignity.\"\n \n As marital equality haltingly but inexorably spreads state by state for gay Americans in the years to come, Utah will hardly be in the lead to follow Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa and Vermont. But the fact that it too is taking its first steps down that road is extraordinary. It is justice, not a storm, that is gathering. Only those who have spread the poisons of bigotry and fear have any reason to be afraid.\n\n \n One of the real tragedies of this message board is how stuff like this will habitually go unaddressed.\n Instead, I can't help but suspect that some people post (or obfuscate) in order to scroll posts like this off the active page into one of the older history pages on the thread.\n \n It matters little ultimately. Those who need to hear it won't. They can't address it.\n And as such, it's part of the reason that their cause is doomed to fail. It's like an attack party leaving their flank wide open, refusing to admit that they have done so. As their flaws are exposed and they ignore them, their attack is weakened regardless of their refusal to admit it... emoticon_rolleyes",

   "No. I am not \"advocating legislation (of) my definition of marriage as the truth\"\n I have NEVER talked about \"truth\" on this issue.\n\n \n Yes, you are. You believe that a union between two people of the same sex is marriage. That is your truth and you don't want to let people judge that issue for themselves.\n \n \n\n I have talked about EQUAL RIGHTS.\n I have furthermore stated that legislation is not \"truth\", which anybody should be able to recognize.\n\n \n You call disagreement with you a violation of your rights. That is the argument for gay marriage: disagreement about what gay marriage is, is a violation of the rights of gay people.\n \n \n\n In discussions with anti-gay marriage advocates, I am routinely amazed at the EXTERNALIZATION that occurs from the anti-gay advocate. The anti-gay advocate will accuse the gay equality advocate of doing something, but the reality is that the anti-gay advocate is ACTUALLY the one doing the OPPOSITE or INVERSE of that thing.\n Here, YOU wish to seek to impose YOUR ideals of \"truth\" in legislation, and are annoyed when I seek to put equality into the government.\n So you accuse me of having the motivation YOU actually have... :xbanghead\n \n\n \n I am not amazed at the hypocrisy of your argument. You are the one externalizing: you want to take away people's freedom of belief in order to protect rights. You want to disenfranchise democracy to protect rights. Bang your head against the wall some more. Cling to those gay marriage talking points.\n \n \n\n Like I said, we've had at least one anti-gay marriage advocate already comment on your posting, and he thinks you are a troll. Quite frankly, I think he's the only one who has commented on you so far, but I wouldn't be surprised if others didn't eventually join him.\n Furthermore, I have seen the admin censor your posts.\n You may \"disagree\" all you like.\n You are wrong, and the evidence against you will build upon itself.\n\n \n Like I said, I identified him as idiotic. Others may join him or not. I've seen either your or someone else make a list of 5 or 6 other people who you've called bigots for disagreeing with you. I think most people on this forum have just tuned out the hate of you and the other gay marriage Westboro Baptist members here. \n \n As far as the admin, he's not censored any of my posts, not to my knowledge. Feel free to post an example if you are not lying about this.\n \n As far as evidence, you have none. You always say that your opinion is a fact. The evidence is is that you are a hateful hypocrite.\n \n \n\n Now isn't this hilarious.\n So basically EVERYBODY else but you are posting \"idiocy\", or they are outright \"trolls\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Reminds me of a joke. A guy is talking to his friend on the cell phone.\n John: Hey. You're driving on the 101 aren't you? News says there is some ##### going the wrong way on 101 South.\n Gary: One guy? Naw! There are 100's!\n :xbanghead\n \n\n \n I think you've been banging your head on the wall too much. It's clearly scrambled your brain cell. Half of the people on this thread (or more) are gay people aggressively arguing for gay marriage. They (including you) are the gay equivalent of the Westboro Baptist Church. Yeah, you've got me outnumbered on a thread on an internet forum. Since you're so confident about how you can win this debate among the American people, you should support a public referendum on whether domestic partnerships should be called \"marriage.\" You'll surely win, if you're being honest about what you've said.\n \n \n\n Let's try a different approach.\n Can you name any anti-gay and/or pro-gay poster here who DOES NOT think your posting habits are inherently slur attacks and derogatorily based?\n \n\n \n I wouldn't bother trying. Most of the people on this thread are the gay equivalent of the Westboro Baptist Church. Theirs and your opinions are hateful and worthless.\n \n \n\n Wow.\n And now you call me insane???\n You keep on tossing the insults out there, don't you...\n\n \n Just as you implied an insult, when you said that I was not like most people who oppose gay marriage. Your hatred makes you unable to be consistent with your own methods.\n \n \n\n But furthermore, you misunderstood what I said.\n I wasn't comparing you to ME.\n I was comparing you to MOST OTHER people who oppose gay marriage.\n \n\n \n You are a confused man who calls other people confused. I never said that you were comparing yourself to me. That was your bad assumption. I know you were comparing me to other people who oppose gay marriage.\n \n \n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n I invite the viewing audience to really LOOK at what Roesgen just said...\n Criticizing my approach, claiming I am mirroring Roesgen's own...\n \n A bit like a man telling another, \"You're pretty ugly, and you look just like me!\"\n \n\n \n By all means, go ahead. It really does mean a lot when the gay version of the Westboro Baptist Church passes their verdict on most the American people who disagree with them. As for your ugliness, I'll just take your word at face value about the misfortune of your looks.\n \n \n\n I have made assertions which I hold are true.\n Marriage is a right.\n The constitution protects equal rights.\n Morality alone lacks legitimate state interest to justify discrimination.\n \n\n \n You have implied that you believe that your opinions are the truth. Marriage is what people believe it is. Marriage is a right for those whom marriage applies to. Same for domestic partnerships. The issue is not about morality, but about the right of freedom of belief, which you seek to undermine.\n \n \n\n I can supply SCOTUS rulings which confirm these assertions, which you blindly label as \"rhetoric\" and you promptly ignore.\n\n \n You're lying. Show me one SCOTUS ruling that you supplied and I ignored.\n \n \n\n If you want to look at \"using no logic\", look at your own claims confusing \"legislation\" with \"truth\". You use a LOT of heavy rhetoric with absolutely NO basis in reality.\n\n \n OK, since I didn't make any claims confusing legislation with truth, I cannot comply with that request. Now let's look back to your lack of logic. You've only stated your opinion and said it was fact. There's your lack of logic. You have no basis in reality, honesty, logic or intelligence, as you copy what I say to me as a child would and repeat it back to me. Polly want a cracker?\n \n \n\n Your replies are nonsensical.\n Recognizing your approach is heavy in vilification is an OBSERVATION OF FACT.\n\n \n Your replies are dishonest demagoguery among a group of people as crazed as you are. You equate your opinion with the truth. You do that again in the bolded section.\n \n \n\n If somebody says \"The sun is yellow and heats the earth\", your reply could conceivably be \"There is no logic\".\n \n But it was an observation of fact. It didn't need to use logic cause it was MORE FUNDAMENTAL than just logic.\n \n Logic STARTS OUT with facts, and builds from there.\n When you IGNORE the facts which are the starting points, you have demonstrated you cannot even build to \"logic\". emoticon_rolleyes\n \n\n \n You just attempted to demonstrate your ability to use logic by using strawman debate tactics. Your argument is based on implying something I never said. (\"The sun is yellow and heats the earth\") Most people who debate know that a strawman debate tactic is illogical and dishonest. You proved your inability to use logic.\n \n \n\n And \"vilification\" is negative. I didn't think I would need to supply people with the dictionary definition to show that....\n vilification: to utter slanderous and abusive statements against : defame\n\n \n You have not shown that the word vilification was inappropriately used. You merely stated it was, and since in your mind, your opinion = the truth, you left it at that.\n \n \n\n ROFLMAO!\n I mimic your words to show you how illogical your claims and approach are.\n All you do over and over again is say \"no logic\" and \"proves nothing\", but you provide ABSOLUTELY NO REFUTATION of what other people say.\n \n\n \n You mimic my words and apply them where they suite you, and ignore them where they don't. All you do is state your opinion as if it were a fact, and then accuse people of doing what you want to do (take away freedoms, not provide proof).\n \n \n\n Marriage is a right.\n Your reply could conceivably be \"no logic\" or \"that's just rhetoric\", but that does not refute the fact that marriage IS a right.\n\n \n Well you show no logic and only rhetoric, which is true. Your mere repeating of true statements does not falsify them. You stated your opinion as if it were a fact.\n \n \n\n \n \"These statutes also deprive the Lovings of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.\"\n SCOTUS: Loving v Virginia\n\n \n OK, fair enough. I'll agree that there is a strong legal foundation that marriage is a right. You showed proof, instead of your opinion. You actually managed to argue correctly one time. Congratulations.\n \n \n\n There is no real discussion with you cause you take the BUILDING BLOCKS of logic, asserted facts, and IGNORE them.\n How can the discussion build to \"logic\" when you disregard even basic observations of fact?\n\n \n There is no real discussion with you because you are Westboro Baptist material in a more mild-mannered form. You don't use logic, you used dirty debate tactics (poisoning the well, strawman arguments) you conflate your opinion with facts, you must complain and moan about having your rhetoric denied instead of trying to provide something meaningful and by and large your arguments are merely talking points of the gay marriage movement.",

   "No, I never claimed human were not extremely social. You are putting words in my mouth. Everyone wants to be accepted for who they are, and you don't want to let people make that decision on their own.\n\n \n Can you put that another way? Because it's not clear what you mean. It sounds like you are saying people should be able to decide whether or not they are accepted on their own. Maybe you mean I am trying to influence people to accept homosexuality? Well, you are trying to influence people to not accept it. That's not correct and just, since you don't have a rational argument for your position.\n \n \nIf there is no difference, then why do you use the word choice that sounds more awkward when describing my argument?\n\n \n \"Made\", is more awkard then \"influenced to become\"? I don't have time to clear every word I write here with you.\n \n \nIt's my country. It's my government. That's what it is to me. I don't want my government influencing people because the far left wants to do that. You're fundamentally saying that your opinion counts more than mine. You're implying that it's ok for you to ask the government to influence people and that I am not entitled to disagree with that. You believe only you have a right to use the government to influence people.\n\n \n Granted the government is for the people, by the people, etc., it's part of society and has influence. The law has influence. I'm thinking of what foundit said about externalization. First you state you don't want \"influencing\", then in the next breath criticize me for believing I am the \"ONLY\" one who should influence government. That implies the existence of OTHER influences on government as well. Your own perhaps, which is based on homophobia? \n \n \nIt's just logic. If you teach someone something, then they believe it. You can teach people to believe in anything and behave in nearly anyway. Human behavior is modifiable, especially young people. That's why philosophers refer to people as tabula rasa or \"blank slates\". You can write what you want on it.\n\n \n There is no proof this applies to sexual orientation. Let's say for arguments sake it is true, though. It would also apply to heterosexuality. What's it to you if people are \"taught\" or \"influenced\" to be gay? You're free to partake of the heterosexual lesson. I can learn the gay one. The lesson I wish to follow should be none of your concern, if you're perfectly happy with the heterosexual lesson. \n \n \nI think that you know this but perhaps since you're insecure from beatings or public ridicule for your lifestyle, that this has clouded your judgment.\n\n \n Garbage. I'm not the one looking over at the other \"school\", and having to irrationally deride it, when it needn't affect my life. That would be you yourself. And many of those who have to beat others in another school, are also insecure, as you are, just more so.\n \n \nAs is the importance to you of all manner of degeneration (i.e. pedophilia, bestiality, etc)\n\n \n Nah, those are paraphilias. Many of those adherants may be gay or straight as their fundamental sexuality. There is harm from such paraphilias. That has to be rationionally, and reasonably, considered.\n \n \nI think your lack of patriotism is showing. Probably happens a lot. :)\n\n \n Why? Because I'm not homophobic?\n \n \nAgain, you are the one who wants government to come in and decide what others should do in bed. I prefer the democratic small government approach to this issue: let people make up their own minds.\n\n \n Fine, let people make up their own minds on the sex of their married spouse. I don't want government to decide what people do in bed. I'm saying it shouldn't regulate what people do in bed as married couples, who they choose to be in the marriage bed with. Let both \"schools\" teach, like I wrote earlier, and let people make up their own minds. You don't see me deriding the heterosexual \"school\", as I've always liked the gay one very much. The straight one doesn't affect the way I live the gay teachings or life. I don't concern myself with what the heterosexual couple next door is doing in their life. I don't need to influence society against them, nor influence government to discriminate against them.",

English common law became the basis of law in the USA and many other English-speaking countries.\n Common law developed after the Norman Conquest 1066 as the law common to the whole of England, rather than local law. As the court system became established under Henry II in the 12th century, and judges' decisions became recorded in law reports, the doctrine of precedent developed. This means that, in deciding a particular case, the court must have regard to the principles of law laid down in earlier reported cases on the same, or similar points, although the law may be extended or varied if the facts of the particular case are sufficiently different. Hence, common law (sometimes called 'case law' or 'judge-made law') keeps the law in harmony with the needs of the community where no legislation is applicable or where the legislation requires interpretation.\n\n \n Common law system - Hutchinson encyclopedia article about Common law system \n \n \n\"We face a problem similar to one that recently confronted the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the highest court of that Canadian province, when it considered the constitutionality of the same-sex marriage ban under Canada's Federal Constitution, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter). See Halpern v. Toronto (City), 172 O.A.C. 276 (2003). Canada, like the United States, adopted the common law of England that civil marriage is \"the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others.\" Id. at, quoting Hyde v. Hyde, [1861-1873] All E.R. 175 (1866). In holding that the limitation of civil marriage to opposite- sex couples violated the Charter, the Court of Appeal refined the common-law meaning of marriage. We concur with this remedy, which is entirely consonant with established principles of jurisprudence empowering a court to refine a common-law principle in light of evolving constitutional standards.\n \n \n Equal Marriage For Same-Sex Couples | Advocacy News | Massachusetts court supports equal marriage",

   ":xbanghead\n \"Truth\" is how you interpret the situation.\n You state \"I believe that ...\", which demonstrates that what follows is MY OPINION. Not \"truth\", but an opinion.\n \n You want YOUR opinion to be known as \"truth\".\n I do not.\n \n Again, don't confuse YOUR approach onto MY arguments...\n\n \n You misrepresent the situation. I understand that your opinion is an opinion, but you think it's the \"truth\" which you try to push on the rest of society and will not let them decide their own truth with a popular vote.\n \n \n\n No. I do not.\n If there is one thing you really need to learn is that when you make claims as to WHAT MY OPINION is, and I tell you explicitly that what you said is NOT my opinion, then you are wrong.\n \n \"Disagreement\" is not a violation of my rights.\n \n\n \n Not only do you call disagreement with you a violation of your rights, your advice here is hypocritical. Your <i<teaching</i< are to do what you say, not do what you do. You constantly tell me what my beliefs are, over what I'm telling you they are, but you do not want the same done to you. That's hypocrisy and you should stop pretending it's not. \n \n \n\n No. It is not.\n That is the strawman some people perpetuate in order to ignore the REAL arguments for gay marriage.\n \n Here is the argument for gay marriage.[*]Marriage is a right.[*]Since marriage is a right, the government must show a legitimate state interest for any discrimination against that right.[*]There is no legitimate state interest for withholding gay marriage.[*]As \"segregation\" SCOTUS rulings showed us, \"separate but equal\" is not constitutional for separating groups with no legitimate state interest for such separation.THAT is the argument for gay marriage.\n \n\n \n Strawman arguments are your specialty, which you've been employing on this thread. \n \n WRT your first point, let's go along with your citing of the Loving case. Let's accept that marriage is a right for the sake of argument. Marriage is a right, so long as you qualify for a marriage. It's sort of like saying that a driver's license is a right if you qualify. Bearing arms is a right if you qualify (you are the appropriate age and you are not a criminal or mentally insane). Voting is a right if you qualify (again if you are not a criminal and are of the appropriate age).\n \n \n\n Again, this is a false statement.[*]Massachusetts has legalized gay marriage.[*]People in Massachusetts still have a \"freedom of belief\" to believe that gay marriage is wrong.Obviously, your claim is just plain false.\n \n\n \n Obviously, you still don't use logic. The situation in Massachussetts has nothing to do with your personal political agenda.\n \n \n\n Like you are clinging to anti-gay marriage talking points?\n Again, you engage in menial complaints that you yourself are guilty of.\n \n\n \n Again, you are engage in hypocrisy, criticizing others of using talking points while using them yourself.\n \n \n\n In the fight for gay marriage, BY YOUR LOGIC, one set of rights is going to suffer for another set of rights.\n If I win and gay marriage is recognized as a right, then by your logic \"democracy\" loses.\n If you win and gay marriage is not recognized as a right, then by your logic \"marriage rights\" lose.\n emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n That's not my logic, since I don't accept that gay marriage is a right. That's your bad assumption.\n \n \n\n Historically, rights SUPERCEDE the vote.\n Let that sink in.\n\n \n Put your ignorance and blinders aside for a moment. Gay marriage is not a right, as I explained above.\n \n \n\n Jim Crow laws were VOTED into place, then courts removed them.\n Interracial marriage laws were VOTED into place, then courts removed them.\n Segregation was VOTED into place, then courts removed them. Laws that discriminate against rights without a legitimate state interest are NOT constitutional.\n\n \n The Tokugawa shogunate was founded and lasted 300 years in Japan. It lead to a prolonged period of peace, but of isolation for Japan. Japan would not encounter foreigners against, until American steamships forced them to trade in the late 19th century. The results of this gunboat diplomacy would eventually lead to Japan copying the UK's model for empire, which lead to an eventual clash with the United States. So gunboat diplomacy should be avoided\n \n \n\n 1) Supply proof of your claim.\n 2) Don't lump me in with other people.\n By your mentality, I could lump you in with Fred Phelps and that would be viable to assess your position on gay rights.\n \n\n \n (1) Do your own homework.\n (2) Don't make personal attacks and then feign outrage.\n \n By my mentality you would be an upstanding decent person. You obviously do not use my mentality. \n \n \n\n ROFLMAO!\n RG, in your short posting time you have had a quick assembly of people identify you as a troll.\n I challenge you to show me another poster who has identified me as a troll.\n \n It isn't me that people have tuned out... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n\n \n ROFLMAO? Are you looking in the mirror again? Then the reaction might be to cry then. Mmmm, never mind. \n \n Several members of the Westboro bigots, including yourself and others have called me a troll, because that is their way of releasing their hatred from years of rejection and failure in society. I pity them and you.\n \n \n\n In the first post of the following thread, anybody can easily see at the bottom the admin's entry for modifying your post...\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/12575-series-insults-injuires.html\n\n \n Indeed, I was not aware that he did. However, I think that only a fool would assume that people view every single word in a very long copy-paste, especially considering that I was already busy providing citations of all of the insults Jason made. \n \n \n\n Calling me a \"hateful hypocrite\" doesn't refute any of the facts I offer.\n I point out you have failed to refute the facts, and you respond with ad hominem while AGAIN failing to address what I have asserted as fact.\n \n\n \n Being a hateful hypocrite doesn't change that my assesment was correct in calling out your lack of facts and your abundance of substituting your opinion for facts. It's also dishonest for you to make rude remarks and then complain about supposed ad hominems.\n \n \n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n There has been one anti-gay marriage poster to comment on you, and it was negative.\n You responded by calling him an #####.\n\n \n You're lying (again?). Actually there were two anti-gay marriage posters who commented. One was supportive of what I've said, and the other was not. You show considerable delusion when you believe that winning popular support for yourself by championing gay marriage in a thread full of rabid gay marriage activists has any meaning whatsoever. \n \n \n\n I welcome others who are against gay marriage to comment on your behavior, but even when they do I suspect you will disregard them.\n \n\n \n Well aside from hypocrisy, and dirty debate tactics, I suspect that you chronically lie, so your suspicions don't carry much weight.\n \n \n\n Either you don't understand my statement or you are purposely misrepresenting it.\n \n The comment I was discussing was YOU and YOUR behavior here.\n You have just switched the conversation to talk about \"gay marriage\".\n As I have explained (and you ignored it), your attitude is atypical for the anti-gay marriage side.\n\n \n Misrepresentation is your game, not mine, as I've pointed out on numerous occasions on this thread. Well since you are dishonest, you are more interested in making personal attacks on me, then debating the issue. I am more interested in the latter. As for my attitude, I think it's squarely in the center of American politics. You are on the rabid side of the left.\n \n \n\n If you really believe that, why do you persist here?\n\n \n Why not? Your arguments are weak, and your personal attacks are easily overridden. Also, it would be wrong for me to let you and the other Westboro boys intimidate me as you do to all who oppose gay marriage.\n \n \n\n Feh.\n Saying somebody is not typical in a specific crowd is not an insult.\n \n Your approach is obvious. You come on here insulting like crazy, when people respond with insults you proclaim \"they started it\" and attempt to continue the insults.\n I have not insulted you, but you are consistently attempting to misrepresent my statements and my position.\n\n \n You have made insults and have had a rude attitude from the start. Your behavior is to insult those who disagree with you, thus baiting them, and then feign outrage when they return the favor. So tell me, have you called jyoshu a biggot yet? Have you implied that he is stupid or not telling the truth yet? How many people who have opposed gay marriage have you belittled and called bigots? \n \n \n\n You lost sight of what was actually said.\n I pointed out YOUR position was atypical.\n You responded by talking about MY position.\n I then pointed out that I was talking about YOU and not me...\n \n\n \n You believe your opinions are the truth and that anyone who disagrees with you is confused. That is your arrogance and delusion. Since you believed that my disagreement was confusion on my part, instead of just trying to deal with my disagreement, you invented something for me to be \"confused\" on. I told you that I had not confused what you said I was confused on, and you continue to try to say that my disagreement with you is merely confusion. You try more to attack your opponent, than to actually understand or debate what they say. \n \n \n\n Your reply showed none of that comprehension.\n \n\n \n Your thought process does not show the intelligence to realize that wishing something to be true does not make it so. \n \n \n\n You keep saying that over and over again to ignore what I have said.\n \n\n \n You fail to realize that me \"saying that over and over again\" addresses what you've said. \n \n \n\n That is the logical conclusion.\n I have outlined the logical reasons for that assessment in this post.\n We will see if you can discuss it \"logically\", or if your response will be nothing more than to call others \"Westboro\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n\n \n It was your first attempt to elevate your comments from your normal childishness of saying things are true because you say they are. You are indeed no better than the Westboro Baptist Church though. You can throw that on top of my reply to your attempted logic.\n \n \n\n Again, Massachusetts has gay marriage.\n People in Massachusetts are free to believe what they want about gay marriage.\n Your claims are false.\n \n\n \n Again, you're being dishonest. You imply that I deny Massachussets has gay marriage. Quote me where I said this. \n \n \n\n Again with the misrepresentation of what I say...\n I stated quite clearly: \"I can supply ...\"\n Indicating that I was acknowledging I haven't supplied it yet...\n \n Since then, I HAVE supplied one SCOTUS ruling statement as a test to see your response to it.\n We'll see if my prediction is accurate...\n\n \n So your saying that you predicted I would not look at what you present, even though you have never presented me with anything to look at? It is likely that you are typically rude to everyone who opposes gay marriage. Thus, you and your Westboro brothers are the trolls here.\n \n \n\n Your response is false.\n To quote you: \"You are advocating legislating your definition of marriage as the truth.\"\n \n You have clearly confused legislation with truth.\n \n\n \n Your response is based on your egotistical and egocentric view of the world. You believe that your opinions are the truth, and that therefore anyone who disagrees with you is \"confused.\" The fact that I have informed you that you mistake your opinions are not the truth, does not mean that I am confused. Your inability to differentiate your opinion from reality is a childish conceit.\n \n \n\n Show me where I have stated my opinion and claimed it was fact.\n Quote me.\n\n \n Look up.\n \n \n\n To repeat the bolded section: \"Recognizing your approach is heavy in vilification is an OBSERVATION OF FACT.\"\n \n I leave it up to the viewing audience to recognize the validity of this claim.\n In this post alone, you have repeated your claims on others \"idiocy\", accused others of being like \"westboro\", claimed others are \"crazed\"...\n \n I repeat the definition of vilification so others can recognize what I am saying is accurate...\n vilification: to utter slanderous and abusive statements against : defame\n \n The funny thing about this is that you DO NOT EVEN TRY to argue against the assessment...\n Only to complain that the assessment was made...\n \n\n \n You don't actually argue your positions. Not really. You just spin and omit information that you find inconvenient. Your attempt to reason is based on spin, bias and hypocrisy. You present others insulting me (which is just you insulting me by proxy) and then feign outrage over the unkind marks I make in return. You make further insults and rudeness, don't list those and then don't show your insults. \n \n It is funny to you that I do not try to argue against your assessments. That is because your assessments are based on the dishonesty and immaturity of the person who made them, and thus I make my own assessments of you instead. That's a better use of the site's bandwidth, than your drivel.\n \n \n\n It's an ANALOGY. emoticon_rolleyes\n I never said you said \"The sun is yellow and heats the earth\"\n \n In fact, if you READ what I actually said, you would realize I was NOT IMPLYING that you said that...\n foundit66: \"If somebody says \"The sun is yellow and heats the earth\", your reply could conceivably be \"There is no logic\".\"\n \n Logically, if I say \"somebody says\" something that YOU could conceivably REPLY TO with something else, then you are obviously NOT the original \"somebody\".\n \n\n \n If you were not such a charlatan, using strawman debate tactics, you wouldn't be using silly quotes and passing them off as something I said or agree with. You would be naked though, without your infantile bag of tricks, so I don't expect you'll stop now.\n \n \n\n The funny thing is that you have supplied nothing from your side.\n You have stated your OPINION that homosexuality is repugnant, and your opinion of this and your opinion of that, but you supply no facts of your own.\n \n\n \n The comments and yourself and the other Westboro boys has been mainly to attack me personally more than to debate the issue, so you chose not to ask me for any facts on laws or statistics or other things. The fact that you lower the level of the debate means that the outcome of such a debate rests is your doing. You tell lies, misrepresent my comments, and make strawman arguments, so perforce my replies will be to supply the facts which debunk your attacks. \n \n \n\n Yet you demand a rigid and \"logical\" response from others, as you vilify the people you respond to...\n \n Your whole approach is inherently designed to evoke an emotional outburst from others, which you will quickly claim victimization from as you continue your attacks.\n\n \n I don't demand anything, except that you try to backup your personal attacks. It's also dishonest of you to make personal attacks, anticipate me calling you on your personal attacks, and then to imply that because you knew I would call you out on those attacks, that this somehow makes your attacks valid. It's really too bad that all you have to go on are these dirty debate tactics. Ah well, maybe at least I can let some of the air out of your cheap ego.\n \n \n\n At this stage, there is no real discussion with you cause you just keep calling people names. You keep repeating the same claims over and over again.\n You complain about others using \"talking points\", as you do precisely that yourself... emoticon_rolleyes\n And then you repeat your claims that other people are \"crazed\" or like \"Westboro\" or ... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n\n \n Again, you're being the dishonest demagogue. You're talking about what I say to \"people\"? Is the discussion between you and I, or are you speaking on behalf of the Westboro boys? \n \n As far as this \"discussion\" is concerned, you're not capable of discussion. Your logic is poor and dishonest, you think you're being subtle with your insults, but you're not. Even if you were, they'd still be insults. Basically, you have an extreme emotional commitment to this issue and you just to personally wrapped up in this to view disagreement with you as anything but an attack on you personally.",

   "How about giving an example?\n What ACTUAL INSTANCE of \"anti-gay\" was seen that was treated one way, where you think it should have been treated differently? Frankly, I talk about a lot of the dregs of the issue. People who want to discriminate against gays in the worst ways. People who want to MALIGN gays, and often get paid to do it.\n\n \n I didn't say I was talking about you. I have had extended exchanges with Jake over this issue (no, I'm not going to go back and try to find those conversations, sorry), and clearly he views mere objection over this as anti-gay. IOW, in his thinking, objection over gay marriage can't EXIST without being anti-gay. Whatever that means.\n \n \nBut you shouldn't take us talking about people who ACTIVELY DISCRIMINATE against gays, and just confuse that with somebody who \"disagrees\" but does none of the more extreme stuff as the same. \n\n \n Frankly, I suspect there are many in your movement who can't get past the idea that disagreement of ANY kind on this IS a form of extremism; whether they would admit it or not, I don't know. That's just my opinion. \n \n \nemoticon_xdonno\n Would you ask people to define what \"anti-black\" means or \"anti-Jewish\" means?\n\n \n Sure, why not? It seems to me that to if someone says something, it can only be helpful if they are SPECIFIC about what they MEAN. Don't you agree?\n \n \nIf somebody said \"I think blacks are inferior\"\n\n \n No, no,  I'm not talking about cases where someone says \"gays are inferior.\" I'm talking about cases where someone opposes gay marriage because their moralistic religious view can't allow for marriage outside of being between one man and one woman. And yet this seems to be commonly the reason for the objection.\n \n \nquestions so you can quibble over the details, WHILE YOU IGNORE the discrimination that occurs against gays.\n\n \n how many times do I have to say that I agree gays are discriminated against? I have not ignored that. I have agreed with it. You're engaging in a falsehood to say so. What do you expect here ... an 'I-agree-gays-are-discriminated-against' type statement in my signature so it will literally be said in every post? Would that appease you? Done. But I suspect you'll still look for reasons to complain.\n \n \nTell you what Jyoshu. When the things I see as more important (like the anti-gay discrimination) are halted, then I'll be able to get around to defining the obvious for you down to the number of decimal points that would make you happy ...\n Until then, operationally, I think people who want to discriminate against gays are \"anti-gay\".\n I think people who malign gays with lies are \"anti-gay\".\n Does that help?\n\n \n Sure. At least you're finally putting some qualifiers out there, even if you ARE doing the rhetorical equivilent of kicking and screaming, to boot. It's progress, at least. (Though it seems to me that specifying what people really MEAN becomes even MORE important if there are issues they want halted. Unless of course, they're trying to intentionally keep the buzz-phrases vague ... emoticon_xangel )\n \n My view is that a phrase like \"anti-gay\" speaks more to MOTIVATIONS than anything else. THAT'S how I would define it--if someone INTENDS to be against gays. So I think a person can be against gay marriage without being \"anti-gay\" if their reasons aren't rooted in being against a person out of prejudice--if they have OTHER reasons that have nothing to do with that PERSON. \n \n And of course I agree with you second qualifier.\n \n For now though, I think I'll keep putting the phrase anti-gay in quotes. Er ... I mean, um, \"anti-gay\".",

   "You really need to understand something.\n I know my opinion better than you.\n You are trying to tell me my opinion is something that I have been definitively telling you that is NOT my opinion.\n You are wrong in your claim.\n\n \n You know what your opinion is, but you don't know what you consider it as. You've demonstrated that you believe your opinion and the truth are interchangeable parts. \n \n \n\n Enough of this garbage.\n Quote me.\n Quote where I \"called disagreement with me a violation of my rights\".\n \n\n \n Obviously not enough, as there is no sign that your writings have improved. Do a keyword search on the word \"right\" under your posts and you will have several examples.\n \n \n\n Wrong.\n I have told you that your OPINION is wrong.\n If you can show me a precise issue where you BELIEVE one thing, and I claim you BELIEVE something else, then please do so.\n Otherwise, your replies are nonsense.\n \n This is getting real old. Roesgen's posts are typically filled with sweeping generalizations and summary claims, but habitually NO SUBSTANCE can be found for the claim.\n A bit like saying \"John hates blacks\", but then the person making the claim can't point to ANY instance of John hating blacks.\n Below is a list of unsubstantiated claims, which Roesgen needs to start ponying up and providing the proof!\n \n\n \n lol You told me my OPINION is wrong. So your opinion is the truth and my opinion is false. Your opinion is truth and your word is proof apparently. Why are you referring to me in the third person? More of your cheap demagoguery amongst the 5 gay dudes rooting you on? Like I said, you never had any intention of honest debate.\n \n \n\n I'm sorry, but \"qualifications\" are just another form of discrimination.\n\n \n So then we \"discriminate\" against people who are underage and against criminals and the insane for voting rights and guns? We \"discriminate\" against people for showing their competence at driving when issuing them a drivers license?\n \n \n\n Suppose somebody wrote a \"qualification\" that says \"The new desk clerk must be a Christian\". That is discriminatory.\n Suppose somebody wrote a \"qualification\" that says \"Marriage applicants must be of the same race to marry\". That is discriminatory.\n \n\n \n More strawman debate tactics. I never said a word about desk clerks and Christians nor interracial marriages. That's all you. \n \n \n\n \"Qualifications\" (as you call them) must satisfy the \"legitimate state interest\" test.\n \n\n \n Says who?\n \n \n\n All you do is rephrase LEGAL discrimination methods as \"qualifications\" in order to ignore the question as to whether or not THIS discrimination method is \"legal\" or not.\n \n There are legitimate state interests in the \"qualifications\" you describe.\n There is no legitimate state interest in discriminating against gay marriage.\n \n\n \n All you do is misrepresent what I say. You criticize me for not putting the cart before the horse. It had to be established first that some certifications issued by the state need to have qualifications. You still seem to be grappling with that concept, so it makes no sense for you to say that I should have already talked about whether or not marriage is applicable to gays. \n \n I'd like to see some proof that any certification or recognition by the state must have a \"state interest.\" I'll tell you what, I'll give you a state interest: democracy and the 14th amendment. Contrary to your beliefs, your opinions are equal to mine, not superior, so the government should treat our opinions equally. We can vote on the word marriage. The outcome will be what gay unions are called in a given state. The state interest is our democratic ideals and the equality of each person's influence on their government.\n \n \n\n WRONG!\n I criticize YOUR CRITICISM of me using \"talking points\".\n You CAN USE \"talking points\" if you like, but don't criticize others for doing that WHEN YOU DO THAT YOURSELF...\n \n\n \n So you admit that you use talking points?\n \n \n\n The obvious retort would be that I don't see it as a right for you to vote on my rights.\n Ergo, you aren't losing any rights either...\n\n \n You have no retort to this point. You made a false assumption, namely that I believe two rights are competing with each other (gay rights vs democracy). Gays have a right to a legally recognized union. They do not have an inherent right to have that union recognized as marriage, so for me there is no conflict. There is no retort for your distorting my argument, only another opportunity for you to try to go on the offense again by using a strawman argument or perhaps misrepresenting something else I said.\n \n \n\n I am not talking about gun-boat diplomacy.\n Your reply was pure nonsense.\n \n I repeat my unaddressed point...\n Jim Crow laws were VOTED into place, then courts removed them.\n Interracial marriage laws were VOTED into place, then courts removed them.\n Segregation was VOTED into place, then courts removed them. Laws that discriminate against rights without a legitimate state interest are NOT constitutional.\n \n\n \n I was not talking about blacks and the KKK.\n Your reply was pure nonsense.\n \n I repeat my unaddressed point....\n Tokugawa united Japan and became its shogun.\n This lead to peace for 250 years.\n Japan had an isolationist policy.\n The US came in and forced their ports open.\n Japan decided to imitate the West, and set the UK as a model for imperialism.\n Japan became imperialist and that led to war with the US.\n Since gunboat diplomacy is a bad idea, so is implementing gay marriage without a popular vote.\n \n \n\n So \"by your mentality\", I would be changed. You admit that.\n By MY mentality, you are free to have what opinion you like. No legislation can or should change that.\n \n You are obviously more controlling than I, yet you try to pretend that I am the one controlling \"beliefs\"... emoticon_frazzled\n \n\n \n No, you just don't see that I am throwing a bomb at you every time you throw one at me. I've been doing that for a while now. Most people would have noticed by now.\n \n \n\n No. I am not.\n Like I said, show me any post showing a similar assessment for me. Otherwise, stop pointing playing this lame \"I am rubber, you are glue\" game.\n \n I repeat what you have avoided...\n RG, in your short posting time you have had a quick assembly of people identify you as a troll.\n I challenge you to show me another poster who has identified me as a troll.\n \n It isn't me that people have tuned out...\n\n \n I highly doubt all of that. People have replied to me dozens of times on this thread. I haven't been tuned out, though I wouldn't mind that so much among you Westboro bigots. I do believe that by the list someone posted on this thread, that you have identified about 5 people on this forum you consider as bigots (you act as the spokesman for the Westboro bigots, so I'll give you credit for all of your members comments) and I'm sure they've tuned you out as well. \n \n Well look, you can call me a troll all you want. Most of the people on this thread are gays who aggressively seek gay marriage. You thinking you beat me here is no different than you doing a rap in Harlem, me playing a country song, and you saying that we can determine who is the better musician by asking the locals whose best. I give you more credit than you deserve by not commenting on how lousy you play your own music, but you get the point.\n \n \n\n I seriously doubt you \"pity\" anybody.\n People don't mock and label people they pity as \"degenerate\".\n \n\n \n You're right about the first part. That was just another putdown. \n \n \n\n \"Lack of facts\"?\n I have supplied statements that you have failed to refute.\n You claim \"lack of facts\" while you give menial rephrasing like trying to claim \"it's qualifications\" instead of recognizing how the law REALLY works.\n \n (Just out of curiousity, have you ever seen ANY court say \"it's just a qualification and thus exempt from 'legitimate state interest' requirements of the 14th amendment? Of course you haven't cause you have no idea what I'm talking about...)\n\n \n Awesome. I merely rephrase, while you the great foundit have provided \"statements that you have failed to refute.\" Wow I definitely could not make statements. Only your amazing intellect can do that. I never made any statements in all my posts. You're amazing. \n \n \n\n There is no \"supposed\" here. Don't be dishonest in not admitting that you ARE perpetuating obvious ad hominems.\n And your claims of \"rude remarks\" are in a completely different situation.\n If I don't hold an OPINION in high regard, that is not the same thing as calling people \"degenerate\".\n \n\n \n Sorry, I'm not a liar like you. You are rude to me, I am rude to you. As for dishonesty, you criticize me for insults. I notice you've been silent on this:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/350199-post2.html\n \n Obviously, you cannot be objective on this issue. Neither can the other Westboro bigots. You are all gay and your acceptance in society hinges on the very issue we debate. You are not capable of objectivity, honesty or civility on this issue. For you, this issue is life and death, that's why you cannot be civilized. For me, I'll be fine one way or the other. I'm not motivated to insult, you and your boys are.\n \n \n\n No. I am not.\n Your follow-on commentary does not even talk about what I said. It's like me saying \"You called Jack an #####\", and you respond by saying \"Mark and Jill did something\".\n That doesn't make me pointing out that you called Jyoshu an ##### a lie.\n \n Here is what I said.\n There has been one anti-gay marriage poster (jyoshu) to comment on you, and it was negative.\n You responded by calling him an #####.\n \n What part of what I ACTUALLY SAID is a lie?\n Cause the truth is that what I said is documentable fact!\n Your reply is a \"dirty debate tactic\"...\n \n\n \n I believe Archangel or whatever his name is defended my comments. You omitted that, which is a lie by omission.\n \n \n\n You trying to tell me what my opinion is IS NOT \"misrepresentation\".\n \n\n \n You define my beliefs as you wish, I extend you the same courtesy. \n \n \n\n That is grotesquely inaccurate.\n 1) What \"personal attacks\" have I made?\n 2) I have debated this issue on MULTIPLE fronts that you are dropping when your position is exposed as fallacious.\n You claim I am trying to \"legislate truth\", but now you have dropped that argument.\n You claim that gay marriage will take away people's \"freedom of belief\", and you have dropped that claim as well.\n \n\n \n (1) Well you just called me dishonest in this very post. You've made indirect insults calling me stupid. \n \n (2) \n You believe marriage is a right for all people. That is your truth. You want it legislated without any vote whatsoever. You believe it should be passed on a federal level, never mind state courts or state capitals. You never said that but it's the logical extension of your deluded belief that gay rights parallels the Civil Rights Movement. That is how you want to legislate your truth. \n \n Having the government recognize gay marriage over the will of the people influences people's children into thinking gay marriage is acceptable. It damages the rights of people to believe what they wish, since you have the government telling people what it believes is true. That government belief is not based on popular belief, it is contrary to popular belief. That makes that infringement on the beliefs of people's families wrong.\n \n \n\n 1) Quote what you label from me as an \"insult\".\n 2) Quote what you label from me as a \"rude attitude\"\n \n\n \n I decline. It's a waste of my time. You act so smart. You should know how to behave. I don't need to waste my time teaching you how to behave. You keep up your attacks, I'll keep up mine. Practically all of my attacks are triggered by your rudeness, so they'll probably cease when and if you start to behave.\n \n \n\n If you do a search, you will see that I habitually avoid using the word \"bigot\" in the first place.\n People like you love to dwell on that word and complain about the label, loudly protesting so that you can obfuscate how wrong it is to discriminate against gays.\n I don't believe I have ever called jyoshu a bigot.\n \n\n \n People like you like to say that everyone who disagrees with you is a bigot, so that you can pass legislation to repeal laws against child molestation, so that you can expand your \"lifestyle\" further in that direction. \n \n As for you and jyoshu, I have found no evidence that you ever called jyoshu a bigot. Congrats.\n \n \n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n Again, you throw out a criticism that you yourself are guilty of.\n Furthermore, I have repeatedly explained that I do not talk about this issue in terms of \"truth\". Allowing gay marriage as an acknowledgement of constitutional equal rights has nothing to do with \"truth\".\n It's about respecting the Constitution.\n\n \n You've been doing that from the start, despite me calling you on it multiple times. Pot meet kettle. \n \n I would like to do a few things. First I would like to marry my houseplant Steve. Then I want to marry my next door neighbor Susie and my other next door neighbor Roxanne. After that I want to marry my dog Rover. Lastly, I want to marry this hole I have in my barnyard door. You do believe I should have the right to do this, yes? \n \n \n\n You are wrong.\n I don't see your \"disagreement\" as confusion.\n I see certain claims you make as BEING confused, and I EXPLAIN WHY they are confused. That explanation has nothing to do with you just \"disagreeing\".\n \n Like your claims that gay marriage somehow takes away people's \"freedom of belief\". That is you being confused, cause your claim is nonsensical.\n \n Your STATEMENTS being confused is a comment on your STATEMENTS.\n You improperly internalize that criticism OF YOUR ARGUMENTS, and think it's about you.\n \n It's rather obvious even by your description that you cannot take disagreement without you claiming it as an \"attack\".\n \n\n \n You really are arrogant. Seriously. Your ego is far larger than your actual intelligence. Seriously. It would have been awesome if you actually were as smart as you think you are. If you had, you could have outmaneuvered me in this debate and I would have enjoyed that. Instead, you make idiotic strawman assumptions, and when I tell you that your assumption is wrong, you say that you don't see why you should believe that your assumption is wrong. I've seen better at arguing the pro-gay marriage argument. \n \n \n\n Quote me.\n Where did I ever say *things are true because I say they are*?\n \n\n \n I can think of two spots on this post right here. One where you say my opinion is wrong, which implies you believe that the mere fact that you believe something makes it right. The second is where you say I am wrong because you believe that gay marriage is a right. I'll go along with marriage being a right (as you showed with the Loving ruling) but you didn't make the jump from marriage being a right to gay marriage being a right.\n \n \n\n I imply that you fail to recognize REALITY when two things are shown to you.\n \n\n \n Well again, it would be nice if you were as smart as your condescending remarks indicate. Sadly, you are not. You believe that since you are you, that your opinions are right, and since your opinions are right only you know what reality is. You argue like a child.\n \n \n\n This is a perfect example of the \"non-reply\" method when Roesgen's statements are exposed as fallacious.\n \n I just proved Roesgen08 wrong.\n Roesgen08's response is to ENTIRELY IGNORE MY ARGUMENT and instead personally attack me...\n \n Here is what I said taht Roesgen did not address...\n It's an ANALOGY.\n I never said you said \"The sun is yellow and heats the earth\"\n \n In fact, if you READ what I actually said, you would realize I was NOT IMPLYING that you said that...\n foundit66: \"If somebody says \"The sun is yellow and heats the earth\", your reply could conceivably be \"There is no logic\".\"\n \n Logically, if I say \"somebody says\" something that YOU could conceivably REPLY TO with something else, then you are obviously NOT the original \"somebody\".\n \n From here on out, I think it best if I just ignore your non-sequiturs.\n I make a point.\n You reply by insulting me and making false claims of \"personal attacks\" against you.\n \n You do it OVER and OVER and OVER again...\n\n \n An analogy is basically a weak argument. Given the fact that you use strawman debate tactics and misrepresentation so much, they are especially so in your case. I can pull an analogy out of my hat right now and say look that's you. In your book, that means you win. Not in mine.\n \n As for insults, you'd have to be disingenuous to say that you haven't been using them on me. Therefore, I am morally free to use them on you.\n \n \n\n The funny thing is that you have supplied nothing from your side.\n You have stated your OPINION that homosexuality is repugnant, and your opinion of this and your opinion of that, but you supply no facts of your own.\n\n \n You have supplied nothing from your side. Your comment is hypocrisy and the usual blindness you display when it comes to self-reflection.",

That's just my opinion. \n\n If we were dealing with JUST that type of situation, I would be more inclined to agree.\n But since we're dealing with one group that wants to discriminate against gays, and the other side wants to stop them, to summarize the situation by just talking about \"disagreement\" is obfuscating the bigger issue...\n \n \n \nSure, why not? It seems to me that to if someone says something, it can only be helpful if they are SPECIFIC about what they MEAN. Don't you agree?\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n If you're dealing with a boundary issue, sure.\n But as the point of this thread has established, we are nowhere near any such boundary situation.\n \n \n \nNo, no,  I'm not talking about cases where someone says \"gays are inferior.\" I'm talking about cases where someone opposes gay marriage because their moralistic religious view can't allow for marriage outside of being between one man and one woman. And yet this seems to be commonly the reason for the objection.\n\n No. It is not \"commonly the reason\".\n As evidence of that, I point to the \"approval/disapproval\" ratings when it comes to JUST CIVIL UNIONS.\n If you look at the numbers for those who \"disapprove\" of gay marriage, and then examine the percentage of those who \"disapprove\" of civil unions, you'll easily see that most people who disapprove of gay marriage ALSO disapprove of civil unions.\n \n So if it were JUST about \"one man, one woman\", then WHY such a large disapproval of civil unions?\n If it were JUST about \"one man, one woman\", it would be obvious to GRANT civil unions as an EXISTING alternative. Yet in state after state, it is fought.\n \n You can see a lot of the \"anti-gay marriage\" legislation EXTENDS PAST just marriage to prevent a \"civil union\" recognition (marriage-like benefits) as well.\n \n \n \nhow many times do I have to say that I agree gays are discriminated against? I have not ignored that.\n\n It's not an issue of CONTRADICTING that gays are discriminated against as much as it is RECOGNIZING and ADMITTING that fact where relevant and pertinent.\n Like earlier in this post, where you concentrate on \"just disagree\" when there is a much larger issue at stake.\n \n \n \nI have agreed with it. You're engaging in a falsehood to say so.\n\n BLOWI.\n I said you IGNORE it, specifically in cases where it should be recognized as the MAJOR bone of contention, and you pick at the splinters...\n \n \n \nSure. At least you're finally putting some qualifiers out there...\n\n I consistently make a point at putting qualifiers in.\n If you think I have missed somewhere where it belongs, point it out.\n Otherwise, your claim is without substantiation...\n \n \n \n(Though it seems to me that specifying what people really MEAN becomes even MORE important if there are issues they want halted. Unless of course, they're trying to intentionally keep the buzz-phrases vague ... emoticon_xangel )\n\n I said what I said, and that's my motivation.\n If you've got a kid who is tracking a couple pounds of mud from the outside, it makes no sense for the kid to demand the mother explain EXACTLY how much dirt and/or dust is allowable to be \"dragged into the house\".\n \n The APPLICATION of these phrases should be obvious.\n Furthermore, it is GLARINGLY obvious that you are NOT EVEN TRYING to argue against SPECIFIC examples of misapplication here.\n Instead, you are insisting that we provide a precise definition, which detracts from the elephant in the room...\n \n \n \nMy view is that a phrase like \"anti-gay\" speaks more to MOTIVATIONS than anything else. THAT'S how I would define it--if someone INTENDS to be against gays.\n\n I disagree.\n A person who wants segregation may argue that he is not \"anti-black\", but the EFFECTS of his efforts do detriment blacks.\n Being indifferent or clueless to the effects of your actions is not a legitimate defense.\n In the legal world, not realizing you were committing a crime isn't a defense against that. As such, not realizing that your actions were detrimental to gays is meaningless.\n \n Do you think anybody asked Martin Luther King Jr what was \"anti-black\"?\n No. Cause it wasn't relevant to the big picture.\n \n By your approach, a person could \"religiously\" envelope themself in ignorance and sincerely believe that homosexuals were pederasts, and in the interests of protecting the children do some pretty vile actions.\n The harm done (e.g. discrimination against gay school teachers, maligning gay people's reputation) may not be MOTIVATED by a desire to harm gays, but the actions are DEFINITIVELY anti-gay.",

That's really special.\n \n If I were her I'd find him the next day and slap the little creep silly.\n\n \n That is a ridiculous assumption. It's like if I said all people who own guns are delusional and paranoid. \n \n People, we are missing the point. NO ONE IS TRYING TO REWRITE OR REDEFINE marriage. If gay marriage advocates really wanted to do that they'd present legislation to do so, instead they are going to the courts to clarify how marriage is applied. If the institution of marriage is denied to people because of their sexual orientation, we are violating their civil rights. It's as simple as that. This has no affect at all on other people's marriage. This is no different then when segregation was struck down. No different at all. The reason some people are angry is because they have this moral standard/opinion that their view of marriage should be law, that is between a man and a woman. The anti-gay marriage people here keep arguing that gay marriage advocates are trying to force their views on them, when they are the ones that are trying to do that. Again, NO ONE trying to force anything down anyone's throat. Clearly, the civil rights act states that their shall be no discrimination to anyone based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion and gender. How some one can fail to understand this is beyond me.emoticon_emb",

   " If the institution of marriage is denied to people because of their sexual orientation, we are violating their civil rights. It's as simple as that.\n\n \n Wrong. Gay marriage is not a civil right, it's a special right that has to be conferred by the government. \n \n It's also a Biblical abomination and shouldn't even be voted on.\n \n And once you say two men are ok to wed, then you can't say no to three men and their pet carp. So there's no bottom to the mess.\n \n \n\n This is no different then when segregation was struck down. No different at all.\n\n \n Sure it is. Blacks cannot contol the pigment of their skin but gays can consciously keep their pants zippered. \n \n Besides, it's not a sin to be black or white, but the act of gay sex is a sin.

   "And demanding segregation of blacks could be perceived as not \"anti-black\"?\n\n \n You miss the issue. What religious people see is a movement to redefine marriage and butt into it, frankly. \n \n \nIf we were dealing with JUST that type of situation, I would be more inclined to agree.\n But since we're dealing with one group that wants to discriminate against gays, and the other side wants to stop them, to summarize the situation by just talking about \"disagreement\" is obfuscating the bigger issue...\n\n \n What a ridiculous over-simplification. There are NUMEROUS \"groups\" involved here: there are those who are ONLY gay marriage, but support CUs, those who oppose both, those who are FOR both, those who oppose gay marriage ONLY culturally and not from a legal standpoint, those who oppose it on ALL grounds, etc., etc. To IGNORE the issue that many simply disagree RATHER than prejudice is to do the whole issue as well as many people a dis-service.\n \n \nNo. It is not \"commonly the reason\".\n As evidence of that, I point to the \"approval/disapproval\" ratings when it comes to JUST CIVIL UNIONS.\n If you look at the numbers for those who \"disapprove\" of gay marriage, and then examine the percentage of those who \"disapprove\" of civil unions, you'll easily see that most people who disapprove of gay marriage ALSO disapprove of civil unions.\n\n \n Say whaaaaa??? How the heck does that prove that religious belief is not commonly the reason??? Particularly when the religious texts they hold to say things like forbidding \"a man lying with a man\" and so forth? Why would you NOT expect them to believe ANY gay relationship is morally wrong?\n \n \nIt's not an issue of CONTRADICTING that gays are discriminated against as much as it is RECOGNIZING and ADMITTING that fact where relevant and pertinent. Like earlier in this post, where you concentrate on \"just disagree\" when there is a much larger issue at stake.\n\n \n CLAFCLOW; I didn't SAY it was an issue of \"contradicting\". LOL!!! I JUST recognized it and JUST admitted it.\n \n Clearly, you're gone back into argumentativeness mode again.\n \n \nThe APPLICATION of these phrases should be obvious. Furthermore, it is GLARINGLY obvious that you are NOT EVEN TRYING to argue against SPECIFIC examples of misapplication here.\n Instead, you are insisting that we provide a precise definition, which detracts from the elephant in the room...\n\n \n \"Johnny hates Mary.\"\n \n \"What??? No, I don't have to actually PROVE that; Johnny just hates her.\" \n \n That's what you don't get. To say someone is ANTI-GAY is an ACCUSATION. You're not going to be able to just get away with it without qualifying it. Then you even have the audacity to expect OTHERS to argue where it's being mis-used rather that using it with qualification to BEGIN WITH. You want to be able to accuse, but then make the accused prove how it's NOT true. Wrongo! Sorry; that's ain't how it works. [wagging finger at Foundit.]",

   "You know what your opinion is, but you don't know what you consider it as.\n\n You keep making illogical claims like this one...\n While \"I know what my opinion is\" is true, the next part of \"but you don't know what you consider it as\" is blatantly false.\n That second part would also be part of my perception. My understanding.\n \n I can't fathom what sort of approach thinks your claim logical. I do know what I consider my opinion as.\n \n \n \nYou've demonstrated that you believe your opinion and the truth are interchangeable parts.\n\n This is false.\n Furthermore, \"truth\" is a word YOU keep trying to interject into the conversation. It is not my word to describe the situation.\n \n \n \nObviously not enough, as there is no sign that your writings have improved. Do a keyword search on the word \"right\" under your posts and you will have several examples.\n\n And thus Roesgen08 demonstrates a refusal to prove the claims made...\n \n If I search for where I have said the word \"right\", it will give me PLENTY of meaningless examples for the ACTUAL issue you claimed. I talk about gay rights a lot.\n \n But I have never claimed \"disagreeing with me is a violation of my rights\".\n \n \n \nlol You told me my OPINION is wrong. So your opinion is the truth and my opinion is false.\n\n You think illogically.\n Just because YOUR opinion is wrong does not automatically make another opinion as \"truth\".\n If Jack has an opinion that the car should turn right, and Jill has an opinion that the car should go straight, the fact that Jack's desire would put the car in the lake does not make Jill's opinion \"truth\".\n \n Furthermore, I have repeatedly explained that my OPINION is not a matter of truth. It is simply an analysis of constitutional law.\n When SCOTUS rules on court cases, do you know their rulings are NOT labelled as \"truth\", but rather as \"OPINIONS\"???\n \n \n \nSo then we \"discriminate\" against people who are underage and against criminals and the insane for voting rights and guns? We \"discriminate\" against people for showing their competence at driving when issuing them a drivers license?\n\n Yes.\n Not all forms of discrimination are illegal.\n In fact, if you had ever bothered to READ a SCOTUS ruling on discrimination, there are tests which allow a judge to determine whether a discrimination is constitutionally valid or not.\n \n \n \nMore strawman debate tactics. I never said a word about desk clerks and Christians nor interracial marriages. That's all you.\n\n :xbanghead\n You obviously don't know what an ANALOGY is.\n Furthermore, I never claimed YOU said that.\n That much should be obvious when I stated: \"Suppose somebody wrote ...\"\n I did not say \"Roesgen08 wrote ...\" :xbanghead\n \n \n \nAll you do is misrepresent what I say.\n\n QUOTE what I have actually misrepresented.\n \n \n \nIt had to be established first that some certifications issued by the state need to have qualifications. You still seem to be grappling with that concept, so it makes no sense for you to say that I should have already talked about whether or not marriage is applicable to gays.\n\n No. I am not \"grappling\" with anything.\n If you read and understood what I said, I clearly stated that qualifications/discrimination against rights CAN LEGALLY EXIST IF and ONLY IF there is a legitimate state interest for such qualifications/discrimination existing.\n \n \n \nI'd like to see some proof that any certification or recognition by the state must have a \"state interest.\"\n\n Read Loving v Virginia.\n The case clearly established that a state desired restriction on marriage (what you would call a \"qualification\") REQUIRED a legitimate state interest for existing.\n Furthermore, it REJECTED the state's claim to a legitimate state interest, REMOVING the \"qualification\" from the law books.\n \n \n \nI'll tell you what, I'll give you a state interest: democracy and the 14th amendment.\n\n If you could actually THINK about it, \"democracy\" alone is obviously NOT a legitimate state interest.\n If it were, EVERY VOTED MEASURE of discrimination (like Jim Crow laws, miscegenation laws, segregation laws) would AUTOMATICALLY SURVIVE 14th amendment requirements.\n \n The fact that I can EASILY point to these issues that SCOTUS REJECTED \"democraticly elected laws\" PROVES that democracy is not sufficient.\n \n By your approach, it's two lions and a lamb voting on what's for dinner.\n \n \n \nContrary to your beliefs, your opinions are equal to mine, not superior, so the government should treat our opinions equally.\n\n :xbanghead\n HOW do you think the government could possibly treat our two \"beliefs\" as \"equal\" when we both want the government to do different things.\n Obviously the government CANNOT treat both beliefs \"equally\".\n \n Furthermore, the government CANNOT treat our beliefs \"equally\" because it is BOUND BY THE CONSTITUTION which requires it observe EQUAL PROTECTION.\n You want to ignore equal protection out of a desire for democratic discrimination.\n It can't do that. Constitution won't allow it.\n \n \n \nSo you admit that you use talking points?\n\n I admit you use talking points.\n I admit you are acting hypocritically in accusing me of using talking points.\n \n (When I talk about \"YOUR CRITICISM\" being \"me using talking points\", that is not me agreeing... :xbanghead )\n \n \n \nYou have no retort to this point.\n\n No. That was my retort.\n Frequently, you complain about your \"democratic\" rights losing out.\n You refuse to recognize that if your \"democratic\" rights win out, my marriage rights lose.\n \n You do this by disregarding my marriage rights and claiming they don't exist.\n What you fail to recognize is that YOU HAVE NO RIGHT to vote discrimination against me without a legitimate state interest.\n \n Please don't claim I \"have no retort\". It's glaringly false.\n \n \n \nYou made a false assumption, namely that I believe two rights are competing with each other (gay rights vs democracy). Gays have a right to a legally recognized union. They do not have an inherent right to have that union recognized as marriage, so for me there is no conflict.\n\n Rather than point out your error, I'm just going to rephrase your words since they apply just as well to you...\n You made a false assumption, namely that I believe two rights are competing with each other (gay rights vs democracy). You have no right to discriminate against my rights without a legitimate state interest, so for me there is no conflict.\n \n \n \nI was not talking about blacks and the KKK.\n Your reply was pure nonsense.\n\n My reply was an analogy.\n I have NO idea what you think your reply means...\n \n \n \nI repeat my unaddressed point....\n Tokugawa united Japan and became its shogun.\n This lead to peace for 250 years.\n Japan had an isolationist policy.\n The US came in and forced their ports open.\n Japan decided to imitate the West, and set the UK as a model for imperialism.\n Japan became imperialist and that led to war with the US.\n Since gunboat diplomacy is a bad idea, so is implementing gay marriage without a popular vote.\n\n Quite frankly, what you did was akin to saying \"Jack didn't like his house. He bought gasoline. He poured gasoline in his living room, bedroom, and kitchen. He threw lit matches into the living room, bedroom, and kitchen which caused the house to burn down. The fire chief found out what Jack did and arrested him for arson.\n Sine Jack had a bad idea, so is implementing democratic vote against people's rights without a legitimate state interest...\"\n emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \nNo, you just don't see that I am throwing a bomb at you every time you throw one at me. I've been doing that for a while now. Most people would have noticed by now.\n\n That is blatantly false.\n You call gays degenerate, and I did nothing against you.\n Furthermore, you claim offense where none is present.\n \n \n \nI highly doubt all of that. People have replied to me dozens of times on this thread. I haven't been tuned out...\n\n I never claimed you were tuned out.\n I said: \"RG, in your short posting time you have had a quick assembly of people identify you as a troll.\n I challenge you to show me another poster who has identified me as a troll.\"\n \n Furthermore, you have refused YET ANOTHER challenge.\n I challenged you to show me another poster who has identified me as a troll.\n \n You can't do it.\n \n \n \nI do believe that by the list someone posted on this thread, that you have identified about 5 people on this forum you consider as bigots ...\n\n Quote and Link to that supposed list.\n Post the names of those \"5 people\".\n \n Let me guess. ANOTHER challenge you will refuse...\n You need to just STOP making up junk.\n \n \n \n(you act as the spokesman for the Westboro bigots, so I'll give you credit for all of your members comments)\n\n That is patently dishonest.\n \n \n \nWell look, you can call me a troll all you want.\n\n False.\n I have stated other people have identified you as a troll.\n That isn't me calling you a troll.\n \n \n \nYou're right about the first part. That was just another putdown.\n\n This is an example of you claiming offense where none is present.\n Not pitying another person is not something to take offense at.\n \n Does the fact that I don't pity you somehow mean I am insulting myself?\n :xbanghead\n \n \n \nSorry, I'm not a liar like you.\n\n This is also false.\n I have not lied to you.\n \n \n \nYou are rude to me, I am rude to you. As for dishonesty, you criticize me for insults. I notice you've been silent on this:\n http://www.4forums.com/political/350199-post2.html\n\n I am not rude to you.\n And as for your last claim, when YOU PICKED THE FIGHT I am not going to criticize another person for employing your tactics back at you.\n \n You get the respect you give...\n \n \n \nFor me, I'll be fine one way or the other.\n\n I thought you claimed that you would lose \"freedom of belief\" if gay marriage was allowed.\n Wait. Silly me.\n You DROPPED that argument after I proved it grotesquely inaccurate. \n \n \n \nI'm not motivated to insult, you and your boys are.\n\n That is grotesquely inaccurate.\n You just called me a liar.\n You have called gays \"degenerate\".\n You quite frequently ARE \"motivated to insult\".\n \n \n \nI believe Archangel or whatever his name is defended my comments.\n\n Where did he do that?\n \n Regardless, you are once again CHANGING THE SUBJECT.\n I am talking about people commenting on YOU. Not 'your comments'.\n \n I repeat:\n There has been one anti-gay marriage poster (jyoshu) to comment on you, and it was negative.\n You responded by calling him an #####.\n This is a factual account that you continue to fail to show inaccurate.\n \n You called it a \"lie\", which is false.\n \n \n \n(1) Well you just called me dishonest in this very post. You've made indirect insults calling me stupid. \n\n QUOTE ME.\n Your claims are repeatedly false, and when challenged you fail to respond to the ACTUAL challenge.\n \n \n \n(2) You believe marriage is a right for all people. That is your truth. You want it legislated without any vote whatsoever. You believe it should be passed on a federal level, never mind state courts or state capitals. You never said that but it's the logical extension of your deluded belief that gay rights parallels the Civil Rights Movement. That is how you want to legislate your truth. \n\n Marriage is a right for all people, as declared by the constitution.\n That is not an issue of \"truth\". Other people can believe marriage is NOT a right.\n \n But what you fail to realize is that when the government works off of legislation and the constitution, it is NOT ABOUT TRUTH.\n \n YOU keep trying to insert that word, yet you fail to recognize when I tell you that my position is NOT about \"truth\".\n \n \n \nHaving the government recognize gay marriage over the will of the people influences people's children into thinking gay marriage is acceptable. It damages the rights of people to believe what they wish, since you have the government telling people what it believes is true.\n\n Your claim is absurd.\n While the presence of gay marriage being legal may \"influence\" children in some menial way, it does NOT \"damage the right of people to believe what they wish\".\n Again, show me ANYBODY in Massachusetts (a state with legal gay marriage) that can't believe as they wish...\n \n \n \nThat government belief is not based on popular belief, it is contrary to popular belief. That makes that infringement on the beliefs of people's families wrong.\n\n The government law not coinciding with popular belief IS NOT an infringement upon beliefs.\n It IS NOT telling people's families that their beliefs are wrong.\n \n The United States has freedom of religion. We are free (and protected) to believe anything we want.\n But Christianity's FIRST COMMANDMENT says there is only one religion and one god that can be worshipped.\n Obviously, the United States LAW is in violation with the first commandment (by your approach).\n Ergo, by your way of thinking, this creates an \"infringement on the beliefs of people's families\"...\n \n You struggle to claim a victimization cause you can't victimize others.\n \n \n \nI decline.\n\n You refuse to quote what I have said that is supposedly insulting and/or \"rude attitude\".\n AGAIN you refuse to substantiate your claims.\n It's a recurring theme with you.\n \n \n \nPeople like you like to say that everyone who disagrees with you is a bigot...\n\n Prove that I do what you claim.\n You can't.\n \n In fact, if you knew anything about me you would know that I have a clear definition for \"bigotry\", and mere disagreement does not suffice.\n \n \n \n... so that you can pass legislation to repeal laws against child molestation, so that you can expand your \"lifestyle\" further in that direction.\n\n This is absurdly false.\n Anybody who has seen me post on this board has seen I find child molestation repugnant.\n \n You are simply trying to insult with such baseless accusations.\n \n \n \nAs for you and jyoshu, I have found no evidence that you ever called jyoshu a bigot. Congrats.\n\n So let's get this straight.\n You ACCUSED me of calling Jyoshu a bigot WITH NO EVIDENCE to your claim.\n AT least you admit you've done that ONCE so far.\n Unfortunately, there are DOZENS MORE times you should admit to such behavior, but you won't.\n \n \n \nI would like to do a few things. First I would like to marry my houseplant Steve.\n\n :xbanghead\n If you look at the marriage rights and responsibilities, such a claim is nonsensical.\n Furthermore, you cannot marry something that cannot consent.\n \n \n \nThen I want to marry my next door neighbor Susie and my other next door neighbor Roxanne.\n\n There are multiple reasons for the laws against polygamy, one of which is how it diminishes the marital rights of marriage inhabitants. \n \n \n \nYou really are arrogant.\n\n And that's another insult.\n You claim to insult me for me insulting you, yet you refuse to show ANY SINGLE INSULT I have given you...\n \n \n \nI can think of two spots on this post right here. One where you say my opinion is wrong, which implies you believe that the mere fact that you believe something makes it right.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n I swear. I wish I could get a moratorium on you claiming that something I did was \"implied\"...\n Again, you being wrong does NOT automatically make me right.\n NOR does it mean I am right just because I said I was right.\n \n \n \nThe second is where you say I am wrong because you believe that gay marriage is a right. I'll go along with marriage being a right (as you showed with the Loving ruling) but you didn't make the jump from marriage being a right to gay marriage being a right.\n\n What's funny is that I have already explained this to you, and you gave some menial obfuscation that involved renaming \"discrimination\" as \"qualification\".\n \n Maybe you can explain what YOU THINK is the difference between a \"discrimination\" and a \"qualification\".\n Let me guess. Another challenge you refuse???\n \n \n \nAn analogy is basically a weak argument.\n\n Is that true just cause you say it's true?\n Or can you explain WHY analogies are \"weak arguments.\n \n \n \nI can pull an analogy out of my hat right now and say look that's you. In your book, that means you win. Not in mine.\n\n Nothing anybody could say against you would be a \"win\" in your book.\n You would insult people and insult gays, claiming other people are insulting you, and sweepingly declare other people as being not worth your time.\n \n The thing with analogies is that if it is invalid, a person can EXPLAIN WHY it is invalid.\n Here, all you did was CLAIM that analogies are \"a weak argument\" and you did nothing else.\n \n \n \nAs for insults, you'd have to be disingenuous to say that you haven't been using them on me.\n\n What's really funny is that you have been responding to me all over the place.\n I challenged you to QUOTE AN INSULT, and you can't do it.\n That proves something about your claim...",

How the heck does that prove that religious belief is not commonly the reason???\n\n :xbanghead\n If you would stop and think, I TYPICALLY ARGUE that \"religious belief is commonly the reason\".\n Ergo, I was NOT arguing against that.\n \n I am talking about the SECOND part of your claim: \"view can't allow for marriage outside of being between one man and one woman\"\n I put forth that their opposition is MORE ACCURATELY recognized as opposition against GAYS, and \"marriage only man + woman\" is just an excuse to that ends.\n \n If the MAJORITY opposition to gay marriage was JUST about \"marriage only man + woman\" with NO additional anti-gay elements, then they would easily have no problem with civil unions.\n But as I pointed out, the MAJORITY of people who are against gay marriage ALSO oppose civil unions. Pointing to the fact that there opposition has MORE to do with gays than just \"marriage only man + woman\".\n \n \n \nCLAFCLOW; I didn't SAY it was an issue of \"contradicting\". LOL!!! I JUST recognized it and JUST admitted it.\n\n :xbanghead\n You are not listening. Read the SECOND SENTENCE which states what the issue ACTUALLY IS here...\n \n It's not an issue of CONTRADICTING that gays are discriminated against as much as it is RECOGNIZING and ADMITTING that fact where relevant and pertinent. Like earlier in this post, where you concentrate on \"just disagree\" when there is a much larger issue at stake.\n \n It's like saying that the Jews and Nazis \"just disagree\", ignoring the LARGER ISSUE that overwhelms simplistic observations on \"just disagree\".\n The ISSUE that they disagreed on is more important to note.\n If somebody assessed history and claimed \"Jews and Nazis disagreed\", that would be an incredible over-simplification!\n \n \n \n\"Johnny hates Mary.\"\n \"What??? No, I don't have to actually PROVE that; Johnny just hates her.\" \n \n That's what you don't get. To say someone is ANTI-GAY is an ACCUSATION.\n\n Yeah. And when the Jews said the Nazis were \"anti-gay\", that was ALSO an accusation.\n \n This gets back to my earlier request which I made of you.\n \n I put forth this challenge: \"What ACTUAL INSTANCE of \"anti-gay\" was seen that was treated one way, where you think it should have been treated differently? Frankly, I talk about a lot of the dregs of the issue. People who want to discriminate against gays in the worst ways. People who want to MALIGN gays, and often get paid to do it.\"\n \n And you replied by giving me JAKE'S assessment...\n \n If you have a problem with Jake's \"accusation\", then TAKE IT UP WITH HIM!\n When I talk about people being anti-gay, you should be able to recognize by now that it is typically one of the following:\n a) somebody espousing discrimination against gays, \n b) somebody maligning gays with slurs.\n \n My \"accusations\" are pretty straight-forward, as the PROOF ITSELF is provided in the THREAD that the accusation is made.\n Sally Kerns? ANTI-GAY!\n Do you need me to explain that one???\n \n Allowing straight marriage to provide for U.S. citizenship, while gays have no option (marriage or civil union). ANTI-GAY.\n Do you need me to explain that one???\n \n If you refuse to give me an example THAT I DID, then don't complain to me about ponying up on my accusations.\n Understand?\n \n \n \nThen you even have the audacity to expect OTHERS to argue where it's being mis-used rather that using it with qualification to BEGIN WITH.\n\n :xbanghead\n I can't believe you can't recognize that goes hand in hand.\n You DEMAND others provide reasoning for assessment of \"anti-gay\" (or some hair splitting definition thereof), and then you REFUSE to show ANY ISSUE WHERE YOU DISPUTE these assessments in the past???\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n You know Jyoshu, maybe I should revive that \"Religious\" thread where you whined about Christianity being a popular victim of \"anti-Christian\" methods, and demand YOU provide a definition...\n \n Or better yet, how about YOU provide a definition of \"anti-gay\"...\n \n \n \nYou want to be able to accuse, but then make the accused prove how it's NOT true. Wrongo! Sorry; that's ain't how it works. [wagging finger at Foundit.]\n\n :xbanghead :xbanghead\n Wow.\n Just WOW!\n \n This gets back to my earlier challenge.\n I will HAPPILY PROVE IT TRUE FOR EVERY TIME I have made that accusation.\n \n THAT WAS PART OF THE POINT of my earlier challenge Jyoshu.\n :xbanghead :xbanghead :xbanghead",

   "My comment is clear, you fail to understand it. I will rephrase for you though. You imply that I deny that humans are extremely social. I never denied that, so your implication made no sense.\n\n \n Nope. I didn't say that at all. I said humans are extremely social, and that's why we want acceptance for who we are, whether we identify as gay or straight. \n \n \nIt's incorrect for you to say that I am trying to influence people not to accept gay marriage, especially since you are trying to FORCE on people to accept it by having the laws changed.\n\n \n Ha, ha! We're both trying to influence. I've never denied trying to influence. I'm talking about equality under the law. Having the right to same-sex marriage, doesn't mean you must personally accept it into your life, by having one. HOwever, saying I can't have one, is affecting the way I live.\n \n \nIt's dishonest of you to say that I don't have a rational argument for my position. You could actually try reading my arguments if you can be bothered to actually know what you are talking about.\n\n \n You haven't made one yet. Calling me dishonest, and leaving it at that, isn't an argument.\n \n \nIf you consider debate on your word choice to be too time-consuming for you then just get lost. I believe you replied to me first.\n\n \n I'd like to debate something of substance. You want to play semantic word games. No one is buying the junk you're peddling, so why don't you get lost?\n \n \nIt's unfortunate that you do your thinking with blinders on. You can dream of me externalizing but you can't look in the mirror and ask yourself if you're externalizing. I do not seek to influence the government, that is what you are doing.\n\n \n Well, the government provides marraige. It makes sense that I'd want to influence it to accept equal marriage for same-sex couples, and you would want to influence it to not accept it. Trying to have what others have is not externalizing. \n \n \nAs for you allegations of homophobia, that is the standard personal attack to make on anyone who disagrees with gay marriage. I am not homophobic. I think that you are trying to get gay marriage legalized so that you can try to get closer to children and fantasize about them.\n\n \n Maybe you should get a dictionary, and look up the words homosexuality and pedophilia. These are not the same things. The fact that you'd suggest this proves your ignorance and homophobia. It's a standard tactic of bigots to say a group they hate are a danger to those deemed vulnerable in society. Blood Libel myth has been used for centuries to suggest that Jews are a danger to Christian children. White racists in the U.S. southern states, thought or some still think, that black men are a threat to white women.\n \n And why isn't heterosexual marriage an attempt by straight men to get closer to children? We know of men in heterosexual marriages, molest their daughters. This is very prevelent. Surely it implies a connection between heterosexuality and pedophilia. No? Do you know, that it's relatively recent that women have been allowed to refuse sex to their husbands? In Afghanistan they won't be able to do this. A study I posted in the Heterosexual Agenda: Exposing the Myths, showed that over 40% of straight men have thought of raping a woman. For the record, I am being facetious, and don't really believe this. \n \n \nIf you can apply your own criticism to yourself, that would be fine with me. You are trying to get the government to change people's attitude towards homosexuality, so the real question is: what's it to YOU if people just believe whatever they want WITHOUT the government teaching anything about homosexuality?\n\n \n Becaue they teach about heterosexuality. Go back and read what I said, unless you have a comprehension problem. I was saying let teaching occur about both. Let that teaching be accurate. People already know about these things. Gays exist, just like straight people exist. \n \n \nFor me, the question is not what lesson is being followed, but what lesson is being taught.\n\n \n Ahhh...so profound-or not. What lesson would you like to be taught about homosexuality? People are going to know about it, and will be asking questions.\n \n \nlol Well you view my opinion as irrational and I feel the same way about yours. Let's be honest here: you want your government to do what you feel is right and so do I.\n\n \n Okay, I agree. We're getting somewhere now.\n \n \nLet me ask you a question: let's say that I and a bunch of other people petition the Canadian government to set aside one day just commemorate what a great guy Stalin was. Everyone still has to go to work, but the day would just be called \"Heroic Stalin Day.\" Would you oppose it? If so, why? It doesn't affect your life.\n\n \n That's a nice try. But there are good reasons to oppose Heroic Stalin day. Stalin did a lot of horrible things, we as a Constitutional democracy, a free society, with a Charter of Rights, cannot celebrate or endorse.\n \n \nWRT insecurities, I'm not insecure. I have no interest in homosexuality. I just would like to keep people who enjoy perversion like you, away from schools, so that you do not start abusing children.\n\n \n I prefer my children slow-roasted on a spit, thank you. To talk seriously about a serious matter, that's a very ignorant piece of propaganda on your part. My choice of perversion is Men's Workout magazine. There are definitely no kiddies there. It's all MEN!\n \n \nAre you saying that pedophilia is OK? If so, then you belong in jail. \n \n \n \n No, because you say \"there is no harm from such paraphiilas.\" If that means what it sounds like, then you belong behind bars.\n\n \n \nNah, those are paraphilias. Many of those adherants may be gay or straight as their fundamental sexuality. There is harm from such paraphilias. That has to be rationionally, and reasonably, considered.\n\n \n That's obviously the opposite of what I said. But, I'll allow you a bit of leeway here. Perhaps you were confused by the way I said they have homosexuality or heterosexuality as their fundamental sexuality. I wasn't saying it's all the same or should be treated the same. I just meant that homosexuality and heterosexuality are themselves fundamental to the way one expresses one's self as a sexual human being. The paraphilias may not be. If a person represses his homosexuality or heterosexuality, that person totally represses themselves as a sexual human being. Even if pedophila could be proven just as fundamental, it is still harmful, and that need to be considered. I'll concede I could have been clearer on that point. \n \n \nWow, nearly every person whose disagreed with me so aggressively is gay. So that's why you have tried so hard to attack me. This issue hits really close to home and you see disagreement with you as an obstacle to your own personal life and your own personal status in society. That explains it.\n\n \n I don't appreciate being accused of wanting to molest children. Talk about a heinous attack! Naturally, it affects my personal life, and my status in society. \n \n \nWRT schools, I will assume that you mean that figuratively. I don't care what gay people say about gay sex. Go ahead and write the Karmasutra of gay sex. I don't care. Just don't try to actually promote homosexuality in a REAL SCHOOL.\n\n \n It's not all about sex acts, even if that's your personal issue(I don't know for sure). We discuss sex between a man and a man. There's nothing wrong with teaching that men and men have sex. It's important to teach about things like disease, relationships, just as they do with heterosexual sex. It's no more promoting for homosexuality than it is for heterosexuality. It's about providing accurate, unbiased, education.\n \n \nIn this country, we have a system called federalism. The federal government decides national policies on economics, national security and civil rights. Gay marriage is a social issue, not a civil right. It should be decided on the state level. Since gay marriage is a belief and not a right, it should be decided by a popular vote in each state. Gay couples should enjoy full tax, financial, survivor, visitation, rights that straight couples enjoy regardless of the vote. That is called a \"domestic partnership\" in Washington State and a \"civil union\" in other states.\n\n \n Canada is kind of similar. Equal marriage for same-sex couples was decided on the provincial level. Then the federal government enacted legislation, when enough provinces had passed laws(actually just complied with legislation after court rulings). But popular votes on these issues are not allowed here. I realize that balance of power, that allows for free popular votes exists in the U.S. Marriage is a social and a civil issue.",

   "You keep making illogical claims like this one...\n While \"I know what my opinion is\" is true, the next part of \"but you don't know what you consider it as\" is blatantly false.\n That second part would also be part of my perception. My understanding.\n \n I can't fathom what sort of approach thinks your claim logical. I do know what I consider my opinion as.\n\n \n You keep considering your opinion as fact, and repeating what I say to you like a parrot. Approaches don't think, so an approach can't think anything is logical. Given that you show no logic, by your thinking that your opinion is fact and you inability to little more than make strawman arguments, it is no surprise that you have reached the limit of what you can fathom.\n \n \n\n This is false.\n Furthermore, \"truth\" is a word YOU keep trying to interject into the conversation. It is not my word to describe the situation.\n \n\n \n Actually, you were the one who interjected the word truth, I just showed your hypocrisy in how you were doing exactly what you were accusing me of.\n \n \n\n And thus Roesgen08 demonstrates a refusal to prove the claims made...\n \n If I search for where I have said the word \"right\", it will give me PLENTY of meaningless examples for the ACTUAL issue you claimed. I talk about gay rights a lot.\n \n But I have never claimed \"disagreeing with me is a violation of my rights\".\n \n\n \n Thus foundit demonstrates he does not understand what he reads. \n \n You believe that disagreeing with you is a violation of your rights.\n \n \n\n You think illogically.\n Just because YOUR opinion is wrong does not automatically make another opinion as \"truth\".\n If Jack has an opinion that the car should turn right, and Jill has an opinion that the car should go straight, the fact that Jack's desire would put the car in the lake does not make Jill's opinion \"truth\".\n \n Furthermore, I have repeatedly explained that my OPINION is not a matter of truth. It is simply an analysis of constitutional law.\n When SCOTUS rules on court cases, do you know their rulings are NOT labelled as \"truth\", but rather as \"OPINIONS\"???\n\n \n You think illogically and you debate dishonestly. You copy my identification in the lack of your logic and repeat it back to me like a parrot would do. The fact that you would label an OPINION to be \"wrong\" shows that you do consider your opinion to be the truth. Unless someone's opinion is an opinion on the quantity, degree or details of a fact, then an opinion cannot be right or wrong. \n \n You opinion is just an opinion, not the truth, nor a fact, nor right, just an opinion. \n \n What you are doing now is another dirty debate trick called \"weasel word.\" I am talking about opinion in the most common meaning of the word. You are now trying to disprove what I'm saying about your opinions by using a different definition of the word. \n \n \n\n Yes.\n Not all forms of discrimination are illegal.\n In fact, if you had ever bothered to READ a SCOTUS ruling on discrimination, there are tests which allow a judge to determine whether a discrimination is constitutionally valid or not.\n \n\n \n OK, then gays not being eligible for gay marriage is also a legal form of discrimination (as you use the term). \n \n WRT SCOTUS rulings, it's too bad that you apparently didn't understand what you were reading, since you obviously can only say that the SCOTUS has tests, and you fail to actually show that there any of these tests prove your point.\n \n \n\n :xbanghead\n You obviously don't know what an ANALOGY is.\n Furthermore, I never claimed YOU said that.\n That much should be obvious when I stated: \"Suppose somebody wrote ...\"\n I did not say \"Roesgen08 wrote ...\" :xbanghead\n \n\n \n You're obviously lying again and attacking me personally, since you are incapable of mustering an argument based on logic, law or principle. Analogies are not proof. \n \n \n\n QUOTE what I have actually misrepresented.\n \n\n \n I have pointed out your misrepresentations of my argument every step along the way. If your reading comprehension is too feeble to see that and you will not invest the effort to read it when I point it out for you, then that is your problem.\n \n \n\n No. I am not \"grappling\" with anything.\n If you read and understood what I said, I clearly stated that qualifications/discrimination against rights CAN LEGALLY EXIST IF and ONLY IF there is a legitimate state interest for such qualifications/discrimination existing.\n\n \n Again, you accuse me of the failing that you had. You said that I used the foundation of an argument to avoid its superstructure. That makes absolutely no sense. You criticized me for bringing up qualifications to ignore that (according to you) qualifications are discriminatory. That's basically like saying that you brought up X, so that you could avoid X then Y. You can't discuss X then Y without first bringing up X. Again demonstrating your failure to use logic.\n \n \n\n Read Loving v Virginia.\n The case clearly established that a state desired restriction on marriage (what you would call a \"qualification\") REQUIRED a legitimate state interest for existing.\n Furthermore, it REJECTED the state's claim to a legitimate state interest, REMOVING the \"qualification\" from the law books.\n \n\n \n The opinion Loving V Virginia rejected miscegenation laws due to a violation of the 14th Amendment. I saw no mention of state interest. \n \n \n\n If you could actually THINK about it, \"democracy\" alone is obviously NOT a legitimate state interest.\n If it were, EVERY VOTED MEASURE of discrimination (like Jim Crow laws, miscegenation laws, segregation laws) would AUTOMATICALLY SURVIVE 14th amendment requirements.\n \n The fact that I can EASILY point to these issues that SCOTUS REJECTED \"democraticly elected laws\" PROVES that democracy is not sufficient.\n \n By your approach, it's two lions and a lamb voting on what's for dinner.\n \n\n \n If your ability to form intelligent thoughts was just half of your over-confidence, you would not rush to such over-simplified conclusions. Democracy is a state's interest. You imply that democracy must always come into conflict with the Constitution. It does not. Do I really have to break that down for you? \n \n \n\n :xbanghead\n HOW do you think the government could possibly treat our two \"beliefs\" as \"equal\" when we both want the government to do different things.\n Obviously the government CANNOT treat both beliefs \"equally\".\n\n \n It treats our two beliefs as equal by assigning each of our beliefs one vote, which is then used in a popular referendum. That is treating beliefs equally. All beliefs that are constitutional have an equal chance at the ballot box.\n \n \n\n Furthermore, the government CANNOT treat our beliefs \"equally\" because it is BOUND BY THE CONSTITUTION which requires it observe EQUAL PROTECTION.\n You want to ignore equal protection out of a desire for democratic discrimination.\n It can't do that. Constitution won't allow it.\n \n\n \n You continue to lie because I do not agree with your gay marriage talking points. Here again, you conflate your opinion with facts. You also enable that with bad assumptions. It is your opinion that democracy must conflict with the Constitution. It does not. We regularly pass laws, we regularly have elections, we regularly create new policies. None of that would be possible if your belief of the irreconcilability of democracy and the Constitution were true.\n \n \n\n I admit you use talking points.\n I admit you are acting hypocritically in accusing me of using talking points.\n \n (When I talk about \"YOUR CRITICISM\" being \"me using talking points\", that is not me agreeing... :xbanghead )\n \n\n \n You use talking points, you hypocritically accuse me of making the mistakes in method that you make, and you childishly repeat back to me what I have just told to you. \n \n \n\n No. That was my retort.\n Frequently, you complain about your \"democratic\" rights losing out.\n You refuse to recognize that if your \"democratic\" rights win out, my marriage rights lose.\n \n You do this by disregarding my marriage rights and claiming they don't exist.\n What you fail to recognize is that YOU HAVE NO RIGHT to vote discrimination against me without a legitimate state interest.\n \n Please don't claim I \"have no retort\". It's glaringly false.\n \n\n \n There is no retort for your mistaken assumption as to what I was arguing. You can either admit that you used a strawman tactic to say that I believe that gay marriage is a right, or you can be dishonest about it by not admitting your mistake and talking about a different disagreement we have. You have chosen the latter course. \n \n You also state your opinion as facts by saying that I must \"recognize\" your opinion as a fact.\n \n \n\n Rather than point out your error, I'm just going to rephrase your words since they apply just as well to you...\n You made a false assumption, namely that I believe two rights are competing with each other (gay rights vs democracy). You have no right to discriminate against my rights without a legitimate state interest, so for me there is no conflict.\n\n \n Your rephrasing of my words to describe what you believe is false. You have said that you believe gay rights and democracy are competing with each other, so for you to say that \"You made a false assumption, namely that I believe two rights are competing with each other (gay rights vs democracy)\" is false. You are saying that you did not argue what you are arguing. I think you proved your disavowal of logic again. \n \n \n\n My reply was an analogy.\n I have NO idea what you think your reply means...\n \n\n \n Analogies are not logical propositions on the subject. Anyone can make an analogy about anything. It has no value for determining truth. You have no idea what my reply means because you merely repeat talking points rather than logically thinking about if your methods in any way prove your conclusions.\n \n \n\n Quite frankly, what you did was akin to saying \"Jack didn't like his house. He bought gasoline. He poured gasoline in his living room, bedroom, and kitchen. He threw lit matches into the living room, bedroom, and kitchen which caused the house to burn down. The fire chief found out what Jack did and arrested him for arson.\n Sine Jack had a bad idea, so is implementing democratic vote against people's rights without a legitimate state interest...\"\n emoticon_xgood\n \n\n \n Exactly. Again, if you actually could see one inch past your nose, you would see that not only does my little historical reference make no sense, it's just as irrelevant to the topic as yours. \n \n \n\n That is blatantly false.\n You call gays degenerate, and I did nothing against you.\n Furthermore, you claim offense where none is present.\n \n\n \n You substitute your opinion for facts again. I made a number of inflammatory remarks about gays after such remarks were made about me. I even provided you a link with all of the personal attacks made by Jason. Your claim that no offense was present proves how I said that you are not capable of objective debate on this subject because you need gay marriage to be accepted so that you can sustain your self-esteem. You need this thing to break your way so desperately that you cannot be objective about it. \n \n \n\n I never claimed you were tuned out.\n I said: \"RG, in your short posting time you have had a quick assembly of people identify you as a troll.\n I challenge you to show me another poster who has identified me as a troll.\"\n \n\n \n Actually you did claim people had tuned me out: \"It isn't me that people have tuned out...\" post #204\n \n \n\n Furthermore, you have refused YET ANOTHER challenge.\n I challenged you to show me another poster who has identified me as a troll.\n \n You can't do it.\n\n \n You're lying again. I didn't refuse your request, and it's a request not a challenge. I didn't see your request, as it is was packaged among some of your less intelligent remarks. I deny your request. I have no interest in reading any more of your posts than I have to. They have less intellectual content than a TV guide. Your behavior on this thread is trollish. That is sufficient.\n \n \n\n Quote and Link to that supposed list.\n Post the names of those \"5 people\".\n \n Let me guess. ANOTHER challenge you will refuse...\n You need to just STOP making up junk.\n \n\n \n Go and find it yourself. Your so-called \"challenges\" are stupid and thus they are the perfect job for you and you alone. You lie when you say I made stuff up. You chronically lie in discussions on gays.\n \n \n\n That is patently dishonest.\n \n\n \n It's painfully true, Mr. Chairman.\n \n \n\n False.\n I have stated other people have identified you as a troll.\n That isn't me calling you a troll.\n\n \n You have stated one fool calling me a troll. That is you calling me a troll.\n \n \n\n This is an example of you claiming offense where none is present.\n Not pitying another person is not something to take offense at.\n \n Does the fact that I don't pity you somehow mean I am insulting myself?\n :xbanghead\n\n \n Perhaps, the topic is too dumb to warrant further attention. Indulge yourself.\n \n \n\n This is also false.\n I have not lied to you.\n\n \n You have lied repeatedly.\n \n \n\n I am not rude to you.\n And as for your last claim, when YOU PICKED THE FIGHT I am not going to criticize another person for employing your tactics back at you.\n \n You get the respect you give...\n \n\n \n Again, you employ your standards (and when I use that word, understand that having no standards is also a standard) selectively. When I mount reprisals, you take offense. When others mount reprisals, then you say that reprisals are acceptable if they are reciprocal. Again, you are not capable of being objective or showing any class.\n \n \n\n I thought you claimed that you would lose \"freedom of belief\" if gay marriage was allowed.\n Wait. Silly me.\n You DROPPED that argument after I proved it grotesquely inaccurate. \n \n\n \n You use strawman tactics again. The fact that people will lose some freedom of belief will not ruin my life (as having the government not assist you, would ruin yours). The fact that I would be fine does not mean that I dropped any arguments. \n \n \n\n That is grotesquely inaccurate.\n You just called me a liar.\n You have called gays \"degenerate\".\n You quite frequently ARE \"motivated to insult\".\n \n\n \n It is totally accurate. You continue to tell lies, make personal attacks and behave rudely. You employ filter out insults made by other Westboro bigots when discussing insults. You and your boys are motivated to insult since this issue is everything to you.\n \n \n\n Where did he do that?\n \n Regardless, you are once again CHANGING THE SUBJECT.\n I am talking about people commenting on YOU. Not 'your comments'.\n \n I repeat:\n There has been one anti-gay marriage poster (jyoshu) to comment on you, and it was negative.\n You responded by calling him an #####.\n This is a factual account that you continue to fail to show inaccurate.\n \n You called it a \"lie\", which is false.\n \n\n \n Find it yourself. You are quite bold in asserting your laziness and incompetence in observing a thread that you speak authoritatively on, but that does not mean I will comply. \n \n I did not change the subject, you are making more personal attacks. \n \n You - your comments, you are mincing words to dodge how you lied by omission. \n \n \n\n QUOTE ME.\n Your claims are repeatedly false, and when challenged you fail to respond to the ACTUAL challenge.\n\n \n You feign ignorance as to your own comments. I will not waste time quoting what you pretend to not know. You continually lie and your childish challenges merely show your inability to defend your opinions on this subject.\n \n \n\n Marriage is a right for all people, as declared by the constitution.\n That is not an issue of \"truth\". Other people can believe marriage is NOT a right.\n \n But what you fail to realize is that when the government works off of legislation and the constitution, it is NOT ABOUT TRUTH.\n \n YOU keep trying to insert that word, yet you fail to recognize when I tell you that my position is NOT about \"truth\".\n \n\n \n Again, you demonstrate considerable idiocy, failing to see that my use of the \"truth\" concept is the same as your use of the concept on me. Since you are merely regurgitating talking points, you fail to see that you are debunking your own argument. \n \n \n\n Your claim is absurd.\n While the presence of gay marriage being legal may \"influence\" children in some menial way, it does NOT \"damage the right of people to believe what they wish\".\n Again, show me ANYBODY in Massachusetts (a state with legal gay marriage) that can't believe as they wish...\n \n\n \n Your claim is disingenuous. You either would like to see children influenced to accept gay marriage or you do not care. That does not make the matter less important. Many parents want their children to have their values. By having the state call domestic partnerships \"marriage\" it affects the beliefs of children against their parents wishes and without even their input through a vote. \n \n Your comment on Massachusetts is another strawman argument. \n \n \n\n The government law not coinciding with popular belief IS NOT an infringement upon beliefs.\n It IS NOT telling people's families that their beliefs are wrong.\n \n\n \n That's exactly what it is. \n \n \n\n The United States has freedom of religion. We are free (and protected) to believe anything we want.\n But Christianity's FIRST COMMANDMENT says there is only one religion and one god that can be worshipped.\n Obviously, the United States LAW is in violation with the first commandment (by your approach).\n Ergo, by your way of thinking, this creates an \"infringement on the beliefs of people's families\"...\n \n\n \n The First Commandment governs individuals, not societies. An individual can follow the First Commandment with our Constitution. There is no conflict there. \n \n \n\n You struggle to claim a victimization cause you can't victimize others.\n \n\n \n You claim victimization so you CAN victimize others.\n \n \n\n You refuse to quote what I have said that is supposedly insulting and/or \"rude attitude\".\n AGAIN you refuse to substantiate your claims.\n It's a recurring theme with you.\n \n\n \n You dishonestly act rudely and then pretend that you are not. You ask me to waste my time proving to you, that which you know. Your dishonesty knows no bounds. \n \n \n\n Prove that I do what you claim.\n You can't.\n \n\n \n You first. You can't.\n \n \n\n In fact, if you knew anything about me you would know that I have a clear definition for \"bigotry\", and mere disagreement does not suffice.\n \n\n \n Prove it. \n \n \n\n This is absurdly false.\n Anybody who has seen me post on this board has seen I find child molestation repugnant.\n \n You are simply trying to insult with such baseless accusations.\n \n\n \n Yep, no doubt. Too bad you don't see the pattern of attack, counterattack. If your IQ was half the size of your ego you'd see it.\n \n \n\n So let's get this straight.\n You ACCUSED me of calling Jyoshu a bigot WITH NO EVIDENCE to your claim.\n AT least you admit you've done that ONCE so far.\n Unfortunately, there are DOZENS MORE times you should admit to such behavior, but you won't.\n \n\n \n No, I believe you are lying again. I believe that I asked you, if I looked would I find you calling Jyoshu a bigot. In any case, prove that I accused you with no evidence to back my claim. \n \n Again, WRT dozens of more times, you are merely lying again.\n \n \n\n :xbanghead\n If you look at the marriage rights and responsibilities, such a claim is nonsensical.\n Furthermore, you cannot marry something that cannot consent.\n \n\n \n Provide proof.\n \n \n\n There are multiple reasons for the laws against polygamy, one of which is how it diminishes the marital rights of marriage inhabitants. \n \n\n \n Elaborate.\n \n \n\n And that's another insult.\n You claim to insult me for me insulting you, yet you refuse to show ANY SINGLE INSULT I have given you...\n \n\n \n If you cannot see your own insults, then you are incredibly dishonest or incredibly deluded. Either way, that's your problem, not mine.\n \n \n\n ROFLMAO!\n I swear. I wish I could get a moratorium on you claiming that something I did was \"implied\"...\n Again, you being wrong does NOT automatically make me right.\n NOR does it mean I am right just because I said I was right.\n \n\n \n I wish I could get a moratorium on your dishonesty, strawman arguments, positing your opinion as facts and you accusing me of what you do. We can all dream.\n \n \n\n What's funny is that I have already explained this to you, and you gave some menial obfuscation that involved renaming \"discrimination\" as \"qualification\".\n \n Maybe you can explain what YOU THINK is the difference between a \"discrimination\" and a \"qualification\".\n Let me guess. Another challenge you refuse???\n \n\n \n Well that's you substituting your opinion for facts again, saying that qualification = discrimination. \n \n Provide proof of your explanation. \n \n As for you so-called challenge, it's not a challenge and I refuse, since you demonstrate your emotional instability by making a smarmy remark after your request. Maybe if I don't answer, it might upset you a bit more. :) \n \n \n\n Is that true just cause you say it's true?\n Or can you explain WHY analogies are \"weak arguments.\n \n\n \n That is your methodology. Sure I can explain why analogies are weak arguments. I already did. Either you have a short memory or you did not read my explanation. I am sure you will also ask me to compensate for your problems as well as your sloth by asking me to go back and repeat the comments for you. You can do that yourself.\n \n \n\n Nothing anybody could say against you would be a \"win\" in your book.\n You would insult people and insult gays, claiming other people are insulting you, and sweepingly declare other people as being not worth your time.\n \n\n \n Well that's your dishonest assertion. You on the otherhand would just state that you are right and others are wrong. You would also misrepresent the other person's argument provide an analogy which proves nothing, throw in some insults and demonstrate a lack of class with rude remarks for good measure. \n \n \n\n The thing with analogies is that if it is invalid, a person can EXPLAIN WHY it is invalid.\n Here, all you did was CLAIM that analogies are \"a weak argument\" and you did nothing else.\n \n\n \n Sure they can. Actually, if you were literate you would see that I mentioned to you that I could make up any old analogy as well, which shows how worthless an analogy is, since you can just make up any random analogy. \n \n \n\n What's really funny is that you have been responding to me all over the place.\n I challenged you to QUOTE AN INSULT, and you can't do it.\n That proves something about your claim...\n\n \n It proves that you make insults and behave with little class, and then disavow knowledge of your behavior. This proves something about you and your claims: you are tiresome and there is no substance or logic to back up your opinions.",

   "Hi Roesgen08, It's time I officially welcomed you to the forum. But what is it about the questions rider asked which you find so partisan or offensive? Wasn't Perez's tirade against that contestant misogynistic and hateful, based on her giving an honest answer to a political question? And isn't it a fair question to ask where the outrage of the women's groups is? \n \n I just want to say that I have enjoyed your posts and the arguments you have made in general, but find this criticism of Easyrider lacking in merit.\n\n \n Hi Archangel. Nice to meet you. Thanks for the support. I appreciate that. :)\n \n IMO, Perez's comments were very wrong. I think he deliberately targeted that girl because of her views and was therefore expressing his intolerance of conservative and moderate social issues. He then asked her a political question and then whined when he got a political answer. His conduct was disgraceful and one could even say it was anti-democratic, in that he opposed freedom of belief and expression. \n \n As for my response to Easyrider, it seems that he was just looking for anything to bash Democrats with. His post made me think that in general, that he is just looking for any opportunity to just to blast Democrats, regardless of whether the event is even relevant to the Democrats. He saw a random event and said to himself hey, how can I use this to bash the Dems? I know, I can use it to bash MSNBC! They're liberal. \n \n Secondly, I watched the video and found his comments to make no sense. Why would someone from MSNBC have to \"distance\" themselves from Hilton, as Easyrider claims? Is that due to an irrational identification of MSNBC with anything that goes wrong in the world? Secondly, the anchor (Norrah O'Donnell) did appear disgusted by Hilton's behavior. It was a little hard to see, but I think I saw it in her facial expression. So thus, Easyrider's partisan attack was baseless.",

   "Nope. I didn't say that at all. I said humans are extremely social, and that's why we want acceptance for who we are, whether we identify as gay or straight. \n\n \n We'll have to disagree on that then. I maintain that you implied that I was opposed to the notion that humans are extremely social.\n \n \n\n Ha, ha! We're both trying to influence. I've never denied trying to influence. I'm talking about equality under the law. Having the right to same-sex marriage, doesn't mean you must personally accept it into your life, by having one. HOwever, saying I can't have one, is affecting the way I live.\n \n\n \n What you are saying is like me saying that the government not giving me $10,000 is affecting the way I live. True enough, but I'm not owed that money from the government. Neither are you owed the description of your union as \"marriage\" from the government.\n \n \n\n You haven't made one yet. Calling me dishonest, and leaving it at that, isn't an argument.\n\n \n Actually, I have and it's dishonest of you to deny that.\n \n \n\n I'd like to debate something of substance. You want to play semantic word games. No one is buying the junk you're peddling, so why don't you get lost?\n \n \n \n You don't want to debate, otherwise you would show some honesty. In any case, I'm glad you've taken my words to heart so now act on them and get lost.\n \n \n\n Maybe you should get a dictionary, and look up the words homosexuality and pedophilia. These are not the same things. The fact that you'd suggest this proves your ignorance and homophobia. It's a standard tactic of bigots to say a group they hate are a danger to those deemed vulnerable in society. Blood Libel myth has been used for centuries to suggest that Jews are a danger to Christian children. White racists in the U.S. southern states, thought or some still think, that black men are a threat to white women.\n \n And why isn't heterosexual marriage an attempt by straight men to get closer to children? We know of men in heterosexual marriages, molest their daughters. This is very prevelent. Surely it implies a connection between heterosexuality and pedophilia. No? Do you know, that it's relatively recent that women have been allowed to refuse sex to their husbands? In Afghanistan they won't be able to do this. A study I posted in the Heterosexual Agenda: Exposing the Myths, showed that over 40% of straight men have thought of raping a woman. For the record, I am being facetious, and don't really believe this. \n\n \n So what you're saying is that you would like to get gay marriage in order to find some kids and bring them into some kind of relationship that is currently illegal? \n \n \n\n Becaue they teach about heterosexuality. Go back and read what I said, unless you have a comprehension problem. I was saying let teaching occur about both. Let that teaching be accurate. People already know about these things. Gays exist, just like straight people exist. \n\n \n No, I understood what you said the first time, though perhaps you were doing some drugs and cannot actually address what I said.\n \n \n\n Ahhh...so profound-or not. What lesson would you like to be taught about homosexuality? People are going to know about it, and will be asking questions.\n\n \n What lesson would I like to be taught about homosexuality? Hmmmm.....how often do you get beat up? \n \n \n\n That's a nice try. But there are good reasons to oppose Heroic Stalin day. Stalin did a lot of horrible things, we as a Constitutional democracy, a free society, with a Charter of Rights, cannot celebrate or endorse.\n \n\n \n Still, Heroic Stalin day does not affect you, so then we should celebrate that. It's the same logic as the justification of gay marriage. Doesn't affect you, so it's all good.\n \n \n\n I prefer my children slow-roasted on a spit, thank you. To talk seriously about a serious matter, that's a very ignorant piece of propaganda on your part. My choice of perversion is Men's Workout magazine. There are definitely no kiddies there. It's all MEN!\n\n \n So they don't have laws against pedophilia in your country?",

   "Roesgen, at this stage, you keep saying some things over and over and over again which are not part of any argument, but part of your repeated summary that still remains unsubstantiated.\n When challenged for substantiation, you habitually refuse / fail.\n For brevity sake, I am cutting out all the junk I have previously refuted which you have no response to other than to insist how bad I am and how dishonest I am...\n \n \nYou keep considering your opinion as fact, and repeating what I say to you like a parrot. Approaches don't think, so an approach can't think anything is logical.\n\n I was obviously saying that I don't understand how you could think your reply was meaningful.\n Evidently you didn't get that, and instead I get this inane \"approaches don't think\" reply... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nActually, you were the one who interjected the word truth, I just showed your hypocrisy in how you were doing exactly what you were accusing me of.\n\n Quote me.\n Show where I claimed my opinion was truth BEFORE you started claiming that I was saying my opinion was truth.\n You can't.\n \n \n \nThus foundit demonstrates he does not understand what he reads. \n You believe that disagreeing with you is a violation of your rights.\n\n This is ridiculously illogical.\n I WROTE the items in question. You are claiming that I am saying \"disagreeing with me is a violation of my rights\", and then criticizing my comprehension when I tell you that I never said that???\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nThe fact that you would label an OPINION to be \"wrong\" shows that you do consider your opinion to be the truth.\n\n That is utterly absurd.\n If John has an opinion that Mark is guilty of murder, that can obviously be wrong.\n I have repeatedly explained that I do not consider my opinion to be \"truth\", so your replies are just fruitlessly denying the obvious.\n \n \n \nYou are now trying to disprove what I'm saying about your opinions by using a different definition of the word.\n\n Much like you trying to say that the \"discrimination\" should be labeled as \"qualification\"...\n \n \n \nOK, then gays not being eligible for gay marriage is also a legal form of discrimination (as you use the term). \n WRT SCOTUS rulings, it's too bad that you apparently didn't understand what you were reading, since you obviously can only say that the SCOTUS has tests, and you fail to actually show that there any of these tests prove your point.\n\n :xbanghead\n Which brings me back to the logical thought process I have already laid out.\n First you didn't know marriage was a right.\n NOW you finally learned that SCOTUS has tests for evaluating rights.\n Do you need me to repeat the next thing in my LOGICAL explanation of gay marriage rights?\n \n \n \nAnalogies are not proof. \n\n They can be. They can help show the flaw in logic.\n It is amusing that you criticize me on the subject of \"logic\", yet you fail to recognize such a fundamental aspect of logic as the use of analogies.\n \n \n \nI have pointed out your misrepresentations of my argument every step along the way.\n\n You have claimed \"misrepresentation\", and then misstated what I have EXPLICITLY told you I was not saying.\n \n \n \nYou said that I used the foundation of an argument to avoid its superstructure. That makes absolutely no sense.\n\n Your claim of what I said is false and makes no sense.\n \n \n \nYou criticized me for bringing up qualifications to ignore that (according to you) qualifications are discriminatory. That's basically like saying that you brought up X, so that you could avoid X then Y. You can't discuss X then Y without first bringing up X. Again demonstrating your failure to use logic.\n\n As is the recurring problem here, your summary of what I said is ridiculously fallacious.\n Furthermore, I laugh at you USING AN ANALOGY (That's basically like saying ...) to refute me, just a few sentences after you insist analogies are not proof.... \n \n The TRUE analogy here is that you looked at X, said it was Y, and then insisted that my classification was wrong because you renamed it Y.\n But the truth is that you haven't refuted the actual classification of X at all by giving it another name.\n \n \n \nThe opinion Loving V Virginia rejected miscegenation laws due to a violation of the 14th Amendment. I saw no mention of state interest. \n\n It didn't use that exact phrase, but it was there...\n \"In Naim, the state court concluded that the State's legitimate purposes were \"to preserve the racial integrity of its citizens,\" and to prevent \"the corruption of blood,\" \"a mongrel breed of citizens,\" and \"the obliteration of racial pride,\" obviously an endorsement of the doctrine of White Supremacy.\"\n \n \"There is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification.\"\n \n \n \nDemocracy is a state's interest. You imply that democracy must always come into conflict with the Constitution. It does not.\n\n Again, you fail at reading comprehension.\n Typically, any time you say \"you imply\", what follows is something I AM NOT saying.\n I am saying that democracy CAN come into conflict with the constitution. When democracy DOES come into conflict with the constitution, democracy loses.\n \n \n \nYou continue to lie because I do not agree with your gay marriage talking points.\n\n That is summarily false.\n \n \n \nHere again, you conflate your opinion with facts. You also enable that with bad assumptions.\n\n I state my opinion which REFLECTS COURT RULINGS and INTERPRETATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION.\n \n \n \nIt is your opinion that democracy must conflict with the Constitution. It does not. We regularly pass laws, we regularly have elections, we regularly create new policies. None of that would be possible if your belief of the irreconcilability of democracy and the Constitution were true.\n\n This is more of your fallacious interpretation.\n It is my opinion that democracy CAN conflict with the constitution.\n When courts look at VOTED LAWS and determine them unconstitutional, and thus REJECT the laws, THAT is the mechanism I am talking about.\n \n You illogically take me talking about what CAN happen, and unintelligibly think I mean it ALWAYS happens. :xbanghead\n \n \n \nYou can either admit that you used a strawman tactic to say that I believe that gay marriage is a right, or you can be dishonest about it by not admitting your mistake and talking about a different disagreement we have.\n\n Again, you fail at reading comprehension.\n I never said that you believe gay marriage is a right.\n I said: \"You refuse to recognize that if your \"democratic\" rights win out, my marriage rights lose.\"\n \n If John refuses to recognize Mary as his sister, stating that does not mean that John believes Mary is his sister.\n \n \n \nAnalogies are not logical propositions on the subject. Anyone can make an analogy about anything. It has no value for determining truth.\n\n There you go again. You. Talking about truth.\n NOT me...\n \n \n \nYou're lying again. I didn't refuse your request, and it's a request not a challenge. I didn't see your request, as it is was packaged among some of your less intelligent remarks. I deny your request.\n\n Another sign your reading comprehension is deficient.\n So you seek to rephrase how I have assessed things, which doesn't actually contradict my assessment, and you formally refuse and/or deny my request...\n :xbanghead\n \n \n \nGo and find it yourself. Your so-called \"challenges\" are stupid and thus they are the perfect job for you and you alone.\n\n I am challenging you to prove your claim.\n The challenge is no more \"stupid\" than what you claim in the first place.\n \n Furthermore, this last one is easy to do.\n 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - Search Results\n If you go to the board search, you can find all instances where user \"foundit66\" posted the word \"bigot\".\n Four uses since January.\n Two in this thread, where I replied to YOU USING the word. I didn't have any list of five bigots.\n One reply to Easyrider talking about bigots.\n The final one over two weeks ago in a thread talking about a nurse student who was fired for being gay.\n \n Your claim is proven false!\n \n \n \nYou have stated one fool calling me a troll. That is you calling me a troll.\n\n emoticon_wow\n I leave it up to the viewing audience to judge the absurdity of that claim.\n \n \n \nThe fact that people will lose some freedom of belief will not ruin my life (as having the government not assist you, would ruin yours).\n\n I never claimed it would ruin your life. :xbanghead\n You confuse your already proven false opinion with \"fact\". \n \n \n \nThe fact that I would be fine does not mean that I dropped any arguments.\n\n When you stopped responding to that issue, THAT is how you \"dropped\" the argument.\n \n \n \nFind it yourself.\n\n And again, Roesgen08 makes claims but refuses to substantiate them...\n \n \n \nI will not waste time quoting what you pretend to not know.\n\n And again, Roesgen08 makes claims but refuses to substantiate them...\n \n \n \nAgain, you demonstrate considerable idiocy, failing to see that my use of the \"truth\" concept is the same as your use of the concept on me.\n\n Except I have not used the concept of \"truth\" on you... :xbanghead\n \n \n \nYou either would like to see children influenced to accept gay marriage or you do not care. That does not make the matter less important.\n\n It is completely unimportant.\n We have no \"right\" to be free from influence in this country.\n \n \nMany parents want their children to have their values.\n\n And the children may very well have the parents' values. That is up to the children to decide, and parents do not have a right to demand reality bend to exclude anything they don't want to see.\n \n \n \nYour comment on Massachusetts is another strawman argument. \n\n Either marriage denies people's beliefs, and we can find examples of that occurring where gay marriage exists, or your assessment is false.\n There is no \"strawman\" here. Simply a test to prove your claim invalid.\n \n \n \nThe First Commandment governs individuals, not societies. An individual can follow the First Commandment with our Constitution.\n\n Gay marriage no more \"governs\" individuals or society than the first commandment does.\n Again, you fail to recognize the logic of an analogy.\n \n \n \nYou first. You can't.\n\n :xbanghead\n Of course I can't prove your inaccurate claim.\n I never claimed I could prove your inaccurate claim. :xbanghead\n \n \n \nProve it. \n\n You want me to prove I have a definition of bigotry that contradicts your false claims as to what I believe???\n \n My definition of bigotry extends to people who want to discriminate against another group.\n \n \n \nProvide proof.\n\n Your replies are nonsensical.\n You want me to prove you can't marry a plant?\n \n \n \nElaborate.\n\n I frequently give reasons and logic, and you ignore it.\n Here, I just gave you one example of the reasons, and you ignored it.\n \"Elaboration\" would be a waste of my time...\n \n \n \nWell that's you substituting your opinion for facts again, saying that qualification = discrimination. \n Provide proof of your explanation.\n\n I have already explained this.\n You refused to address my explanation.\n \n Furthermore, it is obvious that you are simply \"parrotting\" \"proof!\" \"proof!\" as retaliation cause you can't provide ANY evidence to believe your MANY claims.\n \n \n \nThat is your methodology. Sure I can explain why analogies are weak arguments. I already did.\n\n You didn't explain squat. You claimed it was not proof, and gave no further explanation.\n \n \n \nSure they can. Actually, if you were literate you would see that I mentioned to you that I could make up any old analogy as well, which shows how worthless an analogy is, since you can just make up any random analogy.\n\n People can make up analogies, but are they GOOD analogies.\n Do they accurately portray the important aspects of the situation for logical evaluation?\n \n By a similar lack of logic as you just portrayed, the capability to form \"any old\" response demonstrates that responses cannot be used.",

   "Wrong. Gay marriage is not a civil right, it's a special right that has to be conferred by the government.\n\n \n Wrong. It is indeed under the law that minorities are protected and guaranteed the same rights in equality and protection as the majority.\n \n \n \nIt's also a Biblical abomination and shouldn't even be voted on.\n\n \n Your opinion, not fact. Some people do not believe what the bible says thus, you shouldn't base your argument solely upon a religious point of view because there is a separation between the church and the laws of the United States.\n \n \nAnd once you say two men are ok to wed, then you can't say no to three men and their pet carp. So there's no bottom to the mess.\n\n \n This is not only a fallacy and flawed assumption, but an opinion that has no merit whatsoever in the debate over same sex marriage. Also, you cannot use the old \"it will lead to bestiality\" phrase because let me repeat it clearly Animals CANNOT give consent.\n \n As far as no bottom to the \"mess\" you claim, seems there's no measurement of the depth to how far you will go to grasp at straws to object to something that neither really effects you, and certainly does not harm anyone.\n \n \n \n \nSure it is. Blacks cannot contol the pigment of their skin but gays can consciously keep their pants zippered.\n \n \n Besides, it's not a sin to be black or white, but the act of gay sex is a sin. That's the difference.\n\n \n \n This is once again a stupid assumption and ridiculous comment on your part.\n Both black and Gays have been discriminated, beaten, murdered, and harassed for who they are. For you to say they can keep their pants zipped I'm sure you then would not oppose to me saying that strait couples don't need marriage either because they can keep their pants zipped as well! \n \n The fact that being gay is a \"sin\" sir, is the reason why so many teens have committed suicide and why so many gays are persecuted due to your type of thinking which lacks depth, understanding, and most of all reason.\n \n People thought back in the Jim Crow law days that two people who were black and white could not get married and that it too was a \"sin\". What else is a sin Easy? Are you free of sin? Can you cast another stone upon the already beaten and bloodied corpses of those gays and lesbians who have been murdered in the name of \"sin?\" \n \n Do not be so quick to judge those based upon your misguided beliefs so quickly. And before you go off and call me a sinner, look at your own sins and flaws. Then come back to me and tell me I should legislate to have all your \"flaws\" become crimes.\n \n Point being is that being gay is not a sin. I love my boyfriend with as much compassion and care as any other strait man would love his girlfriend. We are both consenting adults, not him, myself, and a nice little shetland pony as you have pointed out earlier. \n \n If all you can argue is \"it's a sin\" to verify your case against same sex marriage then it's already doomed. Come up with a legitimate answer next time. Not this Archie and Roesbunkle ignorant bigotry.",

   "Exactly. Anymore it's gay this and gay that and they're trying to ram it down everyone's throat. It's disgusting. Why do we need to know which way people perform sex? Just shut up about the gay proclivities.\n\n \n Sorry that my intimate details about me pitching and catching has scarred your ears Easy. In no way has anyone described how they have performed sex. Whats disgusting is that you think we try to cram our ways down your throat. Am I forcing you to watch gay porn? Am I forcing you to partake in sexual actions with another male? \n \n I don't think so, so why don't you stop with the idiotic comments then.\n gay marriage is not a way to force you to have to deal with gay sex. And also, you don;t have to attend the wedding (though I don't think you would either) and you dont even have to eat the rather delicious and lavish cake either! \n \n Also if I may add, I find that rotten fish smell to be rather disgusting as well Easy. To each his own I guess...\n \n \n \nAnd that's why \"Don't ask, don't tell\" should remain the rule of the military. Otherwise some jerk is going to go off like Perez Hilton did and a Rambo-type is going to break his stupid neck.\n\n \n Your a #####. The military currently has thousands of gays and lesbians serving in the armed forces. There has been no proof of unit in cohesion or that gays and lesbians perform worse or make unit morale suffer.\n \n So not allowing someone to die and protect your rights due to their sexual orientation is not discriminatory? Hate to break it to you Easy but many Gays and Lesbians have already shed their blood fighting for your freedom.....",

   "Trash blogger retracts apology to Miss California USA; invokes the \"c-word\"\n \n On MSNBC (natural habitat of slimers), (Perez) Hilton says he takes back his apology for calling Prejean a \"dumb b*tch\" and then pours on even more slime by laughing that while he called her that epithet he was really thinking of the \"c-word.\" \n \n Michelle Malkin Trash blogger retracts apology to Miss California USA; invokes the \"c-word\"\n \n And that dumb \"MSNBC host Norah O'Donnell says nothing to distance herself from the misogynist attack.\"\n \n Where's the women's groups to go after that clod? Where's mainstream gay groups to denounce the creep?\n\n \n \nHi Archangel. Nice to meet you. Thanks for the support. I appreciate that. :)\n \n IMO, Perez's comments were very wrong. I think he deliberately targeted that girl because of her views and was therefore expressing his intolerance of conservative and moderate social issues. He then asked her a political question and then whined when he got a political answer. His conduct was disgraceful and one could even say it was anti-democratic, in that he opposed freedom of belief and expression. \n \n As for my response to Easyrider, it seems that he was just looking for anything to bash Democrats with. His post made me think that in general, that he is just looking for any opportunity to just to blast Democrats, regardless of whether the event is even relevant to the Democrats. He saw a random event and said to himself hey, how can I use this to bash the Dems? I know, I can use it to bash MSNBC! They're liberal. \n\n \n Regarding the bolded, I really didn't interpret his post as you do. You must admit that MSNBC IS the source for leftist rants and anti-conservative bigotry on every issue. As a liberal source of News, you would expect them to uphold everyones right to be heard and to voice their principles openly without condemnation, yet they constantly promote only one side of the issues while condemning the other side as ignorant, stupid or low class, such as the teabagging racist redneck rant they allowed Jeanine Garafalo to spew. \n \n Not to mention the very hosts of the shows they air. A more consistently subjective and blatantly narrow minded group of commentators would be difficult to find on any other Network in America.\n \n So his criticism of them as liberal mouth pieces is valid, but he never even mentioned democrats in his response since we all know that many of the protesters at the Tea Parties were also democrats. This protest is not partisan IMO, but the leftist talking heads want to make it appear so in order to divide and conquer this National movement.\n \n \n Secondly, I watched the video and found his comments to make no sense. Why would someone from MSNBC have to \"distance\" themselves from Hilton, as Easyrider claims? Is that due to an irrational identification of MSNBC with anything that goes wrong in the world? Secondly, the anchor (Norrah O'Donnell) did appear disgusted by Hilton's behavior. It was a little hard to see, but I think I saw it in her facial expression. So thus, Easyrider's partisan attack was baseless.\n\n \n Rider was accurately pointing out that there is no objective reprting going on at MSNBC and he is absolutely right about that. I don't know how old you are my friend, but you should know that there was a time when the holy grail of News reporting was to remain totally objective while reporting only the facts of the story while never, EVER influencing or taking any side of the issue. The reason for this was so the listener can decide for themselves what they believe and determine for themselves which side is right. \n \n But those days are gone as we have alleged journalists promoting a political philosophy and condemning anyone who believes differently than they do. This is wrong yet this attempt at indoctrinating the public rather than reporting on events is the status quo with sources like MSNBC. And rider is correct for pointing that out. You should know that rider will be an ally of yours here, and you'll also find him to be a fair observer of events. Just so you know... emoticon_xhoho",

   "We'll have to disagree on that then. I maintain that you implied that I was opposed to the notion that humans are extremely social.\n\n \n People don't want to be included in acceptance for who they are? Yes, we will have to disagree. If we do it for heterosexuals, we should do it for homosexuals(in terms of acceptance and inclusion).\n \n \nWhat you are saying is like me saying that the government not giving me $10,000 is affecting the way I live. True enough, but I'm not owed that money from the government. Neither are you owed the description of your union as \"marriage\" from the government.\n\n \n You're saying I can't have what the heterosexuals have because I'm gay and you don't like that. That's discrimination, bigotry, prejudice. It's not an argument.\n \n \nActually, I have and it's dishonest of you to deny that.\n\n \n When did this occur? No one's seen evidence of it. \n \n \nYou don't want to debate, otherwise you would show some honesty.\n\n \n I haven't been dishonest. Actually, there is nothing to debate with those opposed to gay inclusion. I'll agree with a point jyoshu made much earlier. I would like to see the debate end, and we can all go home. But as long as people are attacking gays personally, and using fallacies, I will be here.\n \n \nIn any case, I'm glad you've taken my words to heart so now act on them and get lost.\n\n \n I haven't taken a word of the rubbish you've written to heart. But like I just said, I'll still be here.\n \n \nSo what you're saying is that you would like to get gay marriage in order to find some kids and bring them into some kind of relationship that is currently illegal?\n\n \n That doesn't make a lot of sense. I'll take a shot at guessing a nuance to what you may be implying. I may or may not personally get married, and I may or may not have kids. I'd say parents should tell their kids that there are gay and straight people in the world. You can't isolate your kids from part of the world. Where did all the gay people come from? We came from all backgrounds, in all times. We were there when society tried to repress our sexuality. We knew who we were then, from a very young age. \n \n \nNo, I understood what you said the first time, though perhaps you were doing some drugs and cannot actually address what I said.\n\n \n It exists. Heterosexuality exists. Accurate knowledge of both is a benefit. Not talking about homosexuality, won't make it go away. And people will talk about it anyway, and it will be there. You're talking about it, just in a negative, prejudiced, hateful, way.\n \n \nWhat lesson would I like to be taught about homosexuality? Hmmmm.....how often do you get beat up?\n\n \n Your defensive insecurity is really showing! That wasn't a come-on line. Honestly, don't flatter yourself, man. I was speaking of the lesson generally taught in society. But of course I know the answer. A lesson that reflects your prejudice. By the way, I don't appreciate being threatened, physically. A secure straight man wouldn't have to do that, even if he thought it was a come-on. You've got something to prove. And you couldn't take me.\n \n \nStill, Heroic Stalin day does not affect you, so then we should celebrate that. It's the same logic as the justification of gay marriage. Doesn't affect you, so it's all good.\n\n \n Well, no. I should have added that other people's marriage or homosexuality or heterosexualty, are very personal things that don't affect anyone else.\n \n \nSo they don't have laws against pedophilia in your country?\n\n \n Well of course not. Also no laws against killing, cooking and eating small children. That's why I said I enjoy doing the latter as well. It's all I part of who I am as a homosexual man.",

   "Fine.\n Name some.\n Name some anti-gay marriage groups that \"support CUs\"...\n\n \n By groups I'm not referring to \"organizations\". I'm saying there are different groups--as in, different subsets of people--who have varying views on this. The \"us versus them\" neaderthal approach of yours is an oversimplification. THAT'S my point.\n \n \nAnd anti-black people didn't see the \"black civil rights movement\" as a means to invade their segregated territory???\n :xbanghead\n :xbanghead\n If you would stop and think, I TYPICALLY ARGUE that \"religious belief is commonly the reason\".\n Ergo, I was NOT arguing against that.\n\n \n Yeah but even then you can't bring yourself to separate it from prejudice as a possibility. Hence you've argued at length about religion in this case BEING a case of prejudice. I'm just trying to get you to see that it's not always the case. \n \n \nIf the MAJORITY opposition to gay marriage was JUST about \"marriage only man + woman\" with NO additional anti-gay elements, then they would easily have no problem with civil unions.\n But as I pointed out, the MAJORITY of people who are against gay marriage ALSO oppose civil unions. Pointing to the fact that there opposition has MORE to do with gays than just \"marriage only man + woman\".\n\n \n But that doesn't prove anything to the point we are discussing. You seem to think that opposing gay marriage AND CU's demonstrates it's not-merely-religious-belief, but if they only oppose marriage and DON'T oppose CUs, you'd be more open to that possibility. The reality is, if someone religiously objects to gay RELATIONSHIPS because of their religion, they're going to naturally not approve of either one. So the objection to CU's makes it all the MORE likely it's a religion thing.\n \n But the more important point here is that, ultimately, an accusation is being made that needs to be proven. It's effectively saying \"so-and-so is anti-gay\", but people need to prove it's NOT happening. You keep bringing up all these examples like racism or anti-semitism, so let's go with that! If someone says \"Foundit is anti-black people\", I sorta think you'd likely take umbrage with that, and expect that assertion to be proven, rather than you having to DISprove it. The same goes if someone says \"Foundit is anti-Jewish\".\n \n \nMy \"accusations\" are pretty straight-forward, as the PROOF ITSELF is provided in the THREAD that the accusation is made.\n Sally Kerns? ANTI-GAY!\n Do you need me to explain that one???\n\n \n You must have a guilty conscience about something, given that you are being extremely defensive when I have not made any claims about YOU.\n \n \nAllowing straight marriage to provide for U.S. citizenship, while gays have no option (marriage or civil union). ANTI-GAY.\n Do you need me to explain that one???\n\n \n emoticon_wow.... In the same sense that it's \"anti-polygamy\" to not allow marriage to multiple people at once, sure.

The \"us versus them\" neaderthal approach of yours is an oversimplification. THAT'S my point.\n\n Your reply kind of proves my point.\n There are NUMEROUS organizations which are opposed to gay marriage AND civil unions.\n But can you name ANY group that is opposed to gay marriage, but SUPPORTS civil unions??? :xbanghead\n \n The reality is clear.\n Over and over again, you talk about the EXISTENCE of things, but refuse to admit how insignificant your additional commentary truly is.\n \n \n \nYeah but even then you can't bring yourself to separate it from prejudice as a possibility.\n\n BLOWI.\n As I explained, my position holds that people can have a religious belief against homosexuality without it being prejudice.\n I have explained to you in the past where I draw the line.\n \n Your commentary here is just making up what you THINK is true (or want to be true) about my position.\n But your commentary is woefully inaccurate regarding my position.\n \n \n \nHence you've argued at length about religion in this case BEING a case of prejudice. I'm just trying to get you to see that it's not always the case. \n\n In THIS case. YES.\n I have NEVER said that the presence of religious objection to homosexuality ALWAYS is prejudice.\n I have REPEATEDLY explained to you before that religious objection IS NOT the same thing as prejudice.\n \n \n \nBut that doesn't prove anything to the point we are discussing. You seem to think that opposing gay marriage AND CU's demonstrates it's not-merely-religious-belief, but if they only oppose marriage and DON'T oppose CUs, you'd be more open to that possibility.\n\n :xbanghead\n :xbanghead\n You're not listening.\n And honestly? Whenever you type \"You seem to think\" or \"you imply\", whatever follows is typically NOT what I think and NOT my position.\n \n This IS NOT about \"not-merely-religious-belief\".\n When I SAID WHAT I SAID (and don't forget that it was my comments that you complained about), my point was that it was \"not-merely-MARRIAGE-PROTECTION\" that was the interests of the people seeking anti-gay marriage efforts.\n \n THAT is the point.\n NOT an issue of \"merely-religious-beliefs\", but it's an issue of being MORE than just \"marriage protection\" extending firmly into making sure that gays are second class citizens by denying them even a marriage ALTERNATIVE.\n \n \n \nThe reality is, if someone religiously objects to gay RELATIONSHIPS because of their religion, they're going to naturally not approve of either one.\n\n Jyoshu, these guys don't approve of \"divorce\". They don't approve of Judaism. They don't approve of working on Sunday. \n There are a MYRIAD of other bible verses that are established as \"God says don't do this\", but they outright ignore those in all situations.\n \n Most people can realize people CAN DO things that they \"don't approve\" of.\n I \"don't approve\" of people saying slanderous things against gays, but I support it as free speech.\n It's a pity these people can't realize that they \"don't approve\" is not a valid inhibitor for preventing EQUAL RIGHTS in this country.\n \n \n \nSo the objection to CU's makes it all the MORE likely it's a religion thing.\n\n :xbanghead\n This was never about whether or not it was a \"religion\" thing or not.\n Once again, I was talking about something else, and you try to steer the conversation into whether or not it was a religious thing.\n \n Remember that I MADE A COMMENT about my view on this, and you OBJECTED to how I explained it.\n So I am EXPLAINING WHY I made that original comment.\n \n \n \nBut the more important point here is that, ultimately, an accusation is being made that needs to be proven.\n\n I've had enough of this.\n WHAT ACCUSATION have I made that has not been proven?\n \n \"If you are going to make that accusation, you need to pony up and prove it.\"\n ***Jyoshu\n \n \n \nYou must have a guilty conscience about something, given that you are being extremely defensive when I have not made any claims about YOU.\n\n :xbanghead\n Wow dude. emoticon_wow\n YOU ARE TALKING TO ME.\n You are REPLYING TO ME.\n \n So when you talk TO ME about unfounded or unproven accusations, and you DO NOT SPECIFY what the heck you are talking about, what is a person supposed to think?\n \n I think it's time you ponied up and PROVIDED SUBSTANCE for these anti-gay \"accusations\" you claim are not substantiated.\n Whether it be me (it would be nice if you could admit that you have NONE for me, cause I think we both know that's the truth), or somebody else.

It gets in the way of simple common sense.\n \n I look at your sentence there and think \"OF COURSE it is \"anti-polygamy\" to not allow polygamy\".\n DUH!\n \n Too many of these conversations involve trying to explain the obvious to people who REALLY INSIST on replying with obfuscational comments to not get it... :xbanghead",

   "Roesgen, at this stage, you keep saying some things over and over and over again which are not part of any argument, but part of your repeated summary that still remains unsubstantiated.\n When challenged for substantiation, you habitually refuse / fail.\n For brevity sake, I am cutting out all the junk I have previously refuted which you have no response to other than to insist how bad I am and how dishonest I am...\n\n \n Well it's amazing to me how you continue to engage in the same kind of nonsense you accuse me of, I point that out and you think you can keep on going and pretending it will go away. The fact that you continue to pass of your opinion as facts, use strawman arguments, and personal attacks and think that's going to pass muster indicates that your comments are not to be taken seriously.\n \n \n\n Evidently you didn't get that, and instead I get this inane \"approaches don't think\" reply... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n\n \n It's utterly foolish how you failed to show literacy in the English language, and then attempted to use that failure as a political argument. You delude yourself into thinking that your nonsensical conclusions and poor literacy make sense.\n \n \n\n Quote me.\n Show where I claimed my opinion was truth BEFORE you started claiming that I was saying my opinion was truth.\n You can't.\n \n\n \n I called you out every time you claimed your opinion was truth. If you weren't paying attention, then that is your problem. Your pretending is dishonest and your telling me to do your reading for you is lazy. \n \n \n\n This is ridiculously illogical.\n I WROTE the items in question. You are claiming that I am saying \"disagreeing with me is a violation of my rights\", and then criticizing my comprehension when I tell you that I never said that???\n emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n You again childishly repeat what I have said to you back to me, following that up with your claim that you have not paid attention to a word I've said in these posts and your lazy demand that I go back and point out to you what I've said. \n \n \n\n That is utterly absurd.\n If John has an opinion that Mark is guilty of murder, that can obviously be wrong.\n I have repeatedly explained that I do not consider my opinion to be \"truth\", so your replies are just fruitlessly denying the obvious.\n \n\n \n You falsely claim that you do not think your opinion is truth. You use an analogy, which is not proof of anything.\n \n \n\n Much like you trying to say that the \"discrimination\" should be labeled as \"qualification\"...\n\n \n You dodge my identification of your using the dishonest debate tactic called \"weasel word\" whereby you attempt to substitute a tertiary definition of a word, in order to criticize my argument. \n \n \n\n :xbanghead\n Which brings me back to the logical thought process I have already laid out.\n First you didn't know marriage was a right.\n NOW you finally learned that SCOTUS has tests for evaluating rights.\n Do you need me to repeat the next thing in my LOGICAL explanation of gay marriage rights?\n \n\n \n You again dodge. You said \"Not all forms of discrimination are illegal.\" So then, gay marriage could be a form of \"discrimination\" that is not illegal. \n \n \n\n They can be. They can help show the flaw in logic.\n It is amusing that you criticize me on the subject of \"logic\", yet you fail to recognize such a fundamental aspect of logic as the use of analogies.\n \n\n \n Your use of analogies to prove your points show that you don't use logic and you have nothing but to justify your beliefs but your personal hope for society to accept your behavior. Analogies are utterly worthless as proof or for logic. No intelligent person would confuse an analogy with proof or as evidence of sound reason.\n \n \n\n You have claimed \"misrepresentation\", and then misstated what I have EXPLICITLY told you I was not saying.\n\n \n Again, I pointed out your misrepresentation along the way, and every time I do, you dodge and make up a new misrepresentation or lame attack.\n \n \n\n Your claim of what I said is false and makes no sense.\n \n\n \n You again dodge how I demonstrated how your comment makes no sense by playing dumb and claiming not to understand what I said.\n \n \n\n As is the recurring problem here, your summary of what I said is ridiculously fallacious.\n Furthermore, I laugh at you USING AN ANALOGY (That's basically like saying ...) to refute me, just a few sentences after you insist analogies are not proof.... \n \n The TRUE analogy here is that you looked at X, said it was Y, and then insisted that my classification was wrong because you renamed it Y.\n But the truth is that you haven't refuted the actual classification of X at all by giving it another name.\n\n \n You prove my comments about your dishonest tactics are correct, because you said my comments made no sense before you even read the explanation of them. \n \n You use further dishonest tactics in claiming that I use an analogy to make my point. I first showed how your comment does not make sense, and AFTER I showed how your comment was not logical, I used an analogy to ILLUSTRATE my point. This is not a subtle distinction. Analogies can be used to illustrate something like a power point presentation, they are not proof in and of themselves as you ignorantly believe. \n \n Your attempt to modify my analysis of your logic fails because you cannot have X without Y. You cannot have a negative characteristic that is not characterizing something. You must first have something to characterize, before you can characterize it. That's where you failed. You said that my bringing up of an issue, is an attempt to not discuss a characteristic you claim it to have, which makes no sense at all, since the issue must first be raised before you can attribute characteristics to it. You cannot attribute characteristics to nothing. \n \n \n\n Again, you fail at reading comprehension.\n Typically, any time you say \"you imply\", what follows is something I AM NOT saying.\n I am saying that democracy CAN come into conflict with the constitution. When democracy DOES come into conflict with the constitution, democracy loses.\n \n\n \n You again demonstrate your thinking to be no more advanced than an egocentric child by thinking that your opinion is automatically true. You dishonestly change your own argument after I have criticized it and then say that I failed to read your argument because it does not address your revision of your argument. \n \n \n\n That is summarily false.\n \n\n \n Provide proof.\n \n \n\n I state my opinion which REFLECTS COURT RULINGS and INTERPRETATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION.\n\n \n You state your opinion as facts and you several methods of dishonest debate tactics.\n \n \n\n This is more of your fallacious interpretation.\n It is my opinion that democracy CAN conflict with the constitution.\n When courts look at VOTED LAWS and determine them unconstitutional, and thus REJECT the laws, THAT is the mechanism I am talking about.\n \n You illogically take me talking about what CAN happen, and unintelligibly think I mean it ALWAYS happens. :xbanghead\n \n\n \n Since you cannot make an intelligent and persuasive argument for gay marriage, you resort to more hypocrisy. You call my interpretation fallacious and then make the fallacious interpretation that democracy conflicts with rights, in order to determine if gay unions shall be called marriage.\n \n \n\n Again, you fail at reading comprehension.\n I never said that you believe gay marriage is a right.\n I said: \"You refuse to recognize that if your \"democratic\" rights win out, my marriage rights lose.\"\n \n If John refuses to recognize Mary as his sister, stating that does not mean that John believes Mary is his sister.\n \n\n \n You again lie. You posited that I believe gay marriage is a right. You said: \"BY YOUR LOGIC, one set of rights is going to suffer for another set of rights\", thus saying that by my logic gay marriage is a right. By my logic, gay marriage is not a right. You continue to use dishonest debate tactics, since you have no legal argument for gay marriage and you cannot show sufficient intelligence to make a more convincing case for it. \n \n \n\n There you go again. You. Talking about truth.\n NOT me...\n \n\n \n You again use the dishonest debate tactic \"weasel word\", attempting to blur the use of one word that is being used in two different points and two different contexts. Truth, as I use it here refers to factual and logical truth, not me talking about any moral and or subjective truths that I might believe.\n \n \n\n Another sign your reading comprehension is deficient.\n So you seek to rephrase how I have assessed things, which doesn't actually contradict my assessment, and you formally refuse and/or deny my request...\n :xbanghead\n\n \n You lie again. Your personal attacks are idiotic, and so they only interest you, not I. I explained this to you, but you proved why you are naturally better suited to this idiocy by failing to understand that. \n \n \n\n I am challenging you to prove your claim.\n The challenge is no more \"stupid\" than what you claim in the first place.\n \n\n \n Your fixation with using personal insults to distract from a weak argument are as stupid as the person who believes it to be a \"challenge.\"\n \n \n\n Furthermore, this last one is easy to do.\n 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - Search Results\n If you go to the board search, you can find all instances where user \"foundit66\" posted the word \"bigot\".\n Four uses since January.\n Two in this thread, where I replied to YOU USING the word. I didn't have any list of five bigots.\n One reply to Easyrider talking about bigots.\n The final one over two weeks ago in a thread talking about a nurse student who was fired for being gay.\n \n Your claim is proven false!\n \n\n \n Prove that I made the claim that you call people bigots or you are a liar.\n \n \n\n I never claimed it would ruin your life. :xbanghead\n You confuse your already proven false opinion with \"fact\". \n \n\n \n You again lie, revising the meaning of your original comment. You implied that I thought gay marriage would ruin my life. You then backpeddle and say you did not mean that.\n \n \n\n When you stopped responding to that issue, THAT is how you \"dropped\" the argument.\n \n\n \n You tell me that my responding to the issue is not responding to the issue. Another example of how you just make things up.\n \n \n\n And again, Roesgen08 makes claims but refuses to substantiate them...\n \n And again, Roesgen08 makes claims but refuses to substantiate them...\n \n\n \n Again foundit pretends to be selectively unaware of his own comments and unaware of the comments of those around him, while speaking authoritatively of both. More dishonesty.\n \n \n\n Except I have not used the concept of \"truth\" on you... :xbanghead\n \n\n \n Except that you have. That's what your argument is premised on.\n \n \n\n It is completely unimportant.\n We have no \"right\" to be free from influence in this country.\n \n\n \n Parents have a right to freedom of belief for their children. Their freedom from government endorsed San Francisco values is completely unimportant to you.\n \n \n\n And the children may very well have the parents' values. That is up to the children to decide, and parents do not have a right to demand reality bend to exclude anything they don't want to see.\n \n\n \n Legal minors are not fully prepared to withstand the influence of extremist ideology, so their rights need to be respected by not having the government push random ideology on them.\n \n \n\n Either marriage denies people's beliefs, and we can find examples of that occurring where gay marriage exists, or your assessment is false.\n There is no \"strawman\" here. Simply a test to prove your claim invalid.\n \n\n \n State back gay marriage influences the beliefs of children who are taught about the legality of gay marriage in Massachusetts. That is an infringement on their freedom of belief. Ideology which is only backed by government alone is an infringement on the freedom of belief, especially on children. \n \n Your claims are false, since you have no proof for them.\n \n \n\n Gay marriage no more \"governs\" individuals or society than the first commandment does.\n Again, you fail to recognize the logic of an analogy.\n\n \n I never said it did \"govern\" individuals or society. That is your bastardization of my words into your comments. Gay marriage adopted as the law would affect society, whereas the First Commandment does not. \n \n Your use of an analogy failed. Your belief that the mere use of an analogy demonstrates that analogies are logical proof of a proposition indicates a lack of intelligence on your part.\n \n \n\n :xbanghead\n Of course I can't prove your inaccurate claim.\n I never claimed I could prove your inaccurate claim. :xbanghead\n \n\n \n You again fail to provide proof of your claims.\n \n \n\n You want me to prove I have a definition of bigotry that contradicts your false claims as to what I believe???\n \n My definition of bigotry extends to people who want to discriminate against another group.\n\n \n So by your definition your ideas are bigoted.\n \n \n\n Your replies are nonsensical.\n You want me to prove you can't marry a plant?\n \n\n \n foundit again fails to prove what he said.\n \n \n\n I frequently give reasons and logic, and you ignore it.\n Here, I just gave you one example of the reasons, and you ignored it.\n \"Elaboration\" would be a waste of my time...\n \n\n \n Again, you refuse my request that you elaborate on your claim. You once again believe that your mere sayso counts as the truth.\n \n \n\n I have already explained this.\n You refused to address my explanation.\n \n Furthermore, it is obvious that you are simply \"parrotting\" \"proof!\" \"proof!\" as retaliation cause you can't provide ANY evidence to believe your MANY claims.\n\n \n You explained nothing and your refusal to provide an explanation is another example of how you merely assume your opinions are the truth.\n \n As for parroting, you now repeat back to me, my identification of your childish parroting, proving my point.\n \n \n\n You didn't explain squat. You claimed it was not proof, and gave no further explanation.\n\n \n I explained how analogies do not prove anything, you failed to understand. \n \n \n\n People can make up analogies, but are they GOOD analogies.\n Do they accurately portray the important aspects of the situation for logical evaluation?\n \n By a similar lack of logic as you just portrayed, the capability to form \"any old\" response demonstrates that responses cannot be used.\n\n \n Analogies are worthless as proof and the structure of the analogy is not the structure of the argument itself. Aside from being completely arbitrary, analogies are not the actual issue being discussed and is thus less relevant than debate on the issue. You use analogies because gay marriage arguments have no merit, so they must rely on the merit of other causes which are worthy. \n \n Your second statement is you again doing childish parroting since you have no legal justification for gay marriage and you fail to provide enough intelligence to make a persuasive argument.",

That's why it's currently the standard.\n\n This claim is false.\n The standard excuse given by the military is that it's about \"unit cohesion\", which is the SAME excuse they used against blacks.\n \n Quite frankly, the military is smarter than to claim that they want to \"protect\" gays from military members who would kill them. Such an allegation is incredibly insulting towards our military.\n \n Could you imagine having a heavily populated Muslim section of our country, with a post office that says \"we don't serve Christians cause if they come here Muslims would kill them\" ???\n The PROBLEM would be fixed instead of capitulating to would-be killers...\n \n \n \nIt's a very simple answer. Canadians are slack when it comes to God and Godly values, which include Biblical admonitions against gay sex. Some 60 to 70% of American soldiers come from Christian homes and many of those families have traditional values. That's why.\n\n Honestly? Your assessments are ridiculously insulting towards the military, and now Christians.\n So Christians would be more likely to kill gays, because of their Christianity???\n \n Wow dude. Just wow!",

   "Wrong.

So there's no bottom to the mess.\n \n \n \n Sure it is. Blacks cannot contol the pigment of their skin but gays can consciously keep their pants zippered. \n \n Besides, it's not a sin to be black or white, but the act of gay sex is a sin.

Sure you can be in any religion you want, but when start to force those religious morals on the masses it akins to a theocracy. Slippery slope argument? Hmmm highly unlikely. There's the issue of consent. If 3 men want to marry each other, let them! They are not doing any harm to you or anyone else. Liberty for all, not just for you.\n \n Wrong again on the last analogy. You can't control your sexual orientation. Gays/Lesbians are not going to go out and have sex in public, your assumption that they will proves you are ignorant. Also, what some of the anti-gay marriage activists are doing is trying to legislate their morals on the masses (prop 8); and, as I said, that simply has no place in politics or in rights.",

As far as a natural animosity, sorry but I think its misguided homophobia and bigoted thinking that your referring to.. \n \n As far as unnatural sex, I could also say that you having sex with your wife or girlfriend unnatural and disgusting.

I have shown that.\n You have insisted, for unknown and irrational reason, that I must use ONLY Loving to achieve this goal. That is nonsense.\n \n It's like insisting that somebody must form an argument for abortion using only the first ten letters of the alphabet.\n \n \n \nRegardless of whether you claim here about the reasons of the involvement of the SCOTUS are true or false (they are false btw), that still does not change that the states interest concerns race and not that a state must prove its interest to pass any law, which is how you described the case.\n\n States' interest requirements do NOT JUST concern race.\n I have proven that with Romer v Evans and Lawrence v Texas.\n \n Furthermore, to educate you on the breadth of state interest application: \n A broad term for any matter of public concern that is addressed by a government in law or policy.\n \n State legislatures pass laws to address matters of public interest and concern. A law that sets speed limits on public highways expresses an interest in protecting public safety. A statute that requires high school students to pass competency examinations before being allowed to graduate advances the state's interest in having an educated citizenry.\n \n Although the state may have a legitimate interest in public safety, public health, or an array of other issues, a law that advances a state interest may also intrude on important constitutional rights. The U.S. Supreme Court has devised standards of review that govern how a state interest will be constitutionally evaluated.\n \n When a law affects a constitutionally protected interest, the law must meet the Rational Basis Test. This test requires that the law be rationally related to a legitimate state interest. For example, a state law that prohibits a person from selling insurance without a license deprives people of their right to make contracts freely. Yet the law will be upheld because it is a rational means of advancing the state interest in protecting persons from fraudulent or unscrupulous insurance agents. Most laws that are challenged on this basis are upheld, as there is usually some type of reasonable relation between the state interest and the way the law seeks to advance that interest.\n \n When a law or policy affects a fundamental constitutional right, such as the right to vote or the right to privacy, the Strict Scrutiny test will be applied. This test requires the state to advance a compelling state interest to justify the law or policy. Strict scrutiny places a heavy burden on the state. For example, in roe v. wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973), the state interest in protecting unborn children was not compelling enough to overcome a woman's right to privacy. When the state interest is not sufficiently compelling, the law is struck down as unconstitutional.State Interest legal definition of State Interest. State Interest synonyms by the Free Online Law Dictionary.\n \n \n \nYou made a specific point on states interests needing to be served for any law to be passed.\n\n I know I didn't say that.\n \"States interests\" are applied in court review of the law AFTER it is passed.\n \n \n \nWhether or not the 14th Amendment is central to Loving in no way changes that the court made a states interest test for racist laws.\n\n Yes. There are \"states interest tests\" for racist laws.\n But as I have shown, there are \"states interest's tests\" for OTHER types of laws also that have nothing to do with race. Interests like sexual orientation.\n \n \n \nIt could be true that the court endorsed all of the content in Meyers, but that still is irrelevant to your state's interest argument, which is levelled against racist laws, not any laws.\n\n I never said it was leveled against \"any laws\".\n It's leveled against laws that restrict rights.\n \n And I have already proven that it HAS BEEN USED in gay cases, so you continuing to talk about its use in \"racist\" cases is meaningless side-tracking.",

   "\"Bonus points\"? The only people looking for a bonus--in this case a FINANCIAL one--are those suing the church.\n\n You are wrong on two levels...\n First, the church was seeking a \"bonus\" in avoiding the law by employing the tactic of shutting down their entire business as a part of refusing to serve this gay couple because they were gay.\n \n Second, for better or for worse this is how redress of grievances for discrimination from private businesses is achieved in this state.\n It is what makes other businesses sit up and take notice.\n \n \n \nThe church should be allowed to close down if they find they can't sell to a given group without violating their religion.\n\n Like I explained, if a STRAIGHT couple had walked up instead of the gay couple, the straight couple would have been rented to.\n The gay couple was REFUSED service.\n \n \"Closing down\" was their EXCUSE in order to try to justify \"REFUSING SERVICE\".\n \n The law clearly states that the service cannot be different.\n Should they get \"special privilege\" just cause it's \"violating their religion\"???\n \n \n \nThey did the right thing in doing so.\n\n No. They didn't.\n They broke the law in providing different treatment between a gay couple and a straight couple.\n \n \n \nThe only way they could possibly AVOID your accusation of discrimination in the WAY they closed would be to go against their religious beliefs for a bit, THEN close.\n\n So????\n We ask people who have PREJUDICED beliefs (without religion) to \"go against their beliefs\" every day.\n \n Why does religion get a special privilege on this issue?\n Why is it that people like you keep complaining about \"religious beliefs\" and people having to go against them, but not once do I see you championing a NON-religious belief to deny service???",

   "Roesgen, you keep saying \"lying\" and then responding with nothing that refutes the point. I am cutting out any mention of \"lying\" in your commentary cause it's a pointless reply on your part.\n It would see if somebody says \"The grass is green\", and then follows that with \"the sky is blue\", you would accuse them of lying cause they said the grass was green... emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n I proved you lied. You are trying to deny that your lie on a specific point on what a specific court case is not a lie by showing your reasons for gay marriage. That makes no logical sense. Even if gay marriage were a right under the Constitution (which it's not), that would not change that you lied about your states interest argument in the court case Loving V. Virginia. You may cut out your replies to my identification of your lie. That is fine with me. It's out there on the record. :) \n \n Since you are \"cutting off\" your direct defense that you lied, I am cutting off your indirect defense of your lie whereby you attempt to show that gay marriage is legal by other means, and that because gay marriage is legal by other means (according to you) that this means that you did not lie about the Loving case. I will reply to your direct defense of your lie, not your diversionary tactics to distract from your lie. \n \n \n\n No. I didn't say that.\n \n I am simply repeatedly proving your claim false.\n Roesgen08: \"A state law does not have to show state interest period, a law that is racist must show state's interest in order to justify racial discrimination.\"\n \n What you did was like pointing to a case where Medicare helped a disabled person, and then pretending that's all Medicare does. Just because you pointed to a racial application doesn't mean \"legitimate state interests\" don't apply elsewhere.\n In fact, I have since proven it applies to gays, which you have not responded to.\n \n I could also show cases where legitimate state interest was used in other cases, like age discrimination, gender discrimination, disability, religion, etc, etc.\n\n \n You argue dishonestly. You make a laughable argument that the phrase \"at least\" in a court case, followed by arguments made on racial grounds is a legal opinion that states must show state interest to justify laws on SEXUAL PREFERENCE. \n \n \n\n I have already addressed this.\n The first time I put up this article I was addressing your inaccurate claim that democracy should win over equal rights.\n I PROVED, with historical precedent that in the U.S. court system our democracy DOES NOT win over equal rights protections of the 14th amendment.\n \n THEN you stopped arguing about democracy.\n You started bringing up ANOTHER flawed argument, and THAT is why I quoted a new relevant (to your new argument) section of Loving v Virginia.\n \n If you hadn't dropped the \"democracy\" argument, I would still be pointing at the originally quoted items to prove that to you. emoticon_rolleyes\n YOU changed YOUR argument, so the \"relevant\" (response to your flawed argument) portions of that ruling changed.\n \n\n \n You \"addressed\" this by insisting that you could show that you did not lie about the content of Loving, by bringing up two other cases. That makes no sense. The content of two other cases will not change that you argued that a specific test was established in the content of Loving. \n \n You tell other lies about what I purportedly believe about democracy vs rights, as a way for you to get off of defense on Loving and switch to the offense. Just posturing on your part. \n \n \n\n Again, your reply is missing the point.\n I have already explained to you that racial discrimination gets \"strict scrutiny\" under the 14th amendment.\n OTHER forms of discrimination get OTHER versions of scrutiny.\n \n I HAVE SHOWN that sexual orientation IS COVERED under legitimate state interest, and DOES have a version (not strict) that is applied to gay discrimination cases.\n You have not contested this historical fact.\n \n\n \n Nope, you miss the point. You attempted to justify your false interpretation of Loving's tests on racial laws by arguing that Loving made reference to a 1940's case which talks about \"strict scrutiny.\" The 1940's case involving strict scrutiny again defined strict scrutiny in terms of RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. So you get no help there either. Regardless of what you think you've proven in general (which you haven't) you have not vindicated your false claim about specific content in Loving V. Virginia.\n \n \n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n I did not misrepresent Loving.\n I brought it up because it proves that SCOTUS has jurisdiction over marriage.\n It proves that \"legitimate state interest\" applies to marriage.\n \n I never claimed it (by itself) proves every aspect of my logical procession.\n \n\n \n You misrepresented Loving by arguing that it established that the state must demonstrate a compelling state interest for laws on marriage. That's not what it said. It said that a state must demonstrate a compelling interest to uphold RACIST LAWS. \n \n \n\n I stated laws THAT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST RIGHTS.\n Don't misrepresent my position.\n \n Furthermore, I can show that state laws that discriminate against rights MUST SATISFY the 14th amendment. I have shown that.\n You have insisted, for unknown and irrational reason, that I must use ONLY Loving to achieve this goal. That is nonsense.\n \n It's like insisting that somebody must form an argument for abortion using only the first ten letters of the alphabet.\n\n \n You lie again. I have clearly NOT said that you must use Loving to achieve this goal. I said that you are trying to make your lie appear that it is not a lie by making your argument without Loving. You may be able to make your argument without Loving, but that will never ever change that you lied about Loving.\n \n What you said about Loving v. Virgina:\n \n \"The case clearly established that a state desired restriction on marriage (what you would call a \"qualification\") REQUIRED a legitimate state interest for existing.\"\n \n \n Which is not what the opinion on Loving actually said:\n \n \n\n At the very least, the Equal Protection Clause demands that racial classifications, especially suspect in criminal statutes, be subjected to the \"most rigid scrutiny,\" Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 216 (1944), and, if they are ever to be upheld, they must be shown to be necessary to the accomplishment of some permissible state objective, independent of the racial discrimination which it was the object of the Fourteenth Amendment to eliminate.\n \n\n \n Source\n \n Loving talked about rigid scrutiny and compelling state's interests for RACIST LAWS, not laws about marriage in general. \n \n \n\n States' interest requirements do NOT JUST concern race.\n I have proven that with Romer v Evans and Lawrence v Texas.\n \n\n \n You are free to believe that. I may choose to argue with you about that another time, once we clear up your lying about Loving. I will not argue with you about those, just so you have something else to say so that you can give the appearance of actual debate in the middle of your defending your lie. \n \n \n\n Yes. There are \"states interest tests\" for racist laws.\n But as I have shown, there are \"states interest's tests\" for OTHER types of laws also that have nothing to do with race. Interests like sexual orientation.\n \n\n \n Irrelevant to your claim that Loving v Virginia established a state interest test for marriage in general. \n \n \n\n And I have already proven that it HAS BEEN USED in gay cases, so you continuing to talk about its use in \"racist\" cases is meaningless side-tracking.\n\n \n Another lie. You bring up two cases talking about how they establish state interest test for marriage in general. You consider it \"meaningless side-tracking\" that you lied about the content of both, and that both cases did not establish a state interest test for marriage in general, but for racist laws. Like I say, you believe that your opinions are reality. You believe that race = sexual preference, and so you say that the fact that a case deals with race and not sexual preference is \"meaningless.\" It would be a great improvement in the honesty and forthrightness of your arguments if you simply stated that you consider race and sexual preference the same thing and the differences between them are \"meaningless.\" Then we could all see that your legal opinions rest on a laughable assumption.",

Because I see that using the power of govt. to rule over beliefs/speech/consenting adults in their own homes is dangerous to our freedom. Live and let Live is a conservative idea...don't be a hypocrite. Think about it.\n\n \n There's no hypocrisy.

The god of YOUR scripture is the creator of YOUR universe. But where does he fit in with the constitution? I see a \"creator\" mentioned, but it is clearly not defined as the god you mention. And where - in the constitution - is there anything written about sin? \n \n Clearly, we can't look to the Ten Commandments to help us figure out what is LEGAL sin and what is ILLEGAL sin. I mean, if we're going to adhere to the Bible, shouldn't we review the Top 10 hits?\n \n Thou shalt have no other gods before me.  hmmm...not illegal. What I like about this translation is that it actually accepts the idea that there are other gods! The god these nice Jews follow needs a lot of ego-stroking, however.Thou shalt not make graven images. hmmm....not illegalThou shalt not use the Lord's name in vain. ....still not illegal! G-dammit!Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.  I'll remember that - but I'm heading out to Target now.Honor thy mother and thy father. And who's going to arrest me if I don'tThou shalt not kill.  AT LAST - SOMETHING WE AGREE ON! (and depending on the translation and the appearance in the bible, yes, this is sometimes called murder, but it\\'s not how we learned it in Sunday school!Thou shalt not commit adultery.  Let\\'s ask Newt Gingrich about this one.Thou shalt not steal.  Bravo! Or should I say brava?Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.  It\\'s a nice idea, but unless it\\'s in a court of law, I really can if I want.Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor\\'s property. There is this house down the street? It has the most amazing swimming pool. And the gardens! And let\\'s not forget those cars parked out front.\n Well, us grizzly gays didn\\'t even make the finals! So - considering that these top 10 sins aren\\'t codified into constitutional law, why then, should we select this one example of sin? \n \n You see, honey, the idea of sin, and the nature of sin, is specific to the individual. Most Protestant churches would even say that we are not to judge others\\' sins, but focus on our own. \n \n So - to get back to this topic: there is nothing to be afraid of. Gay couples are getting married in 4 states now. Your house didn\\'t collapse, and the sky didn\\'t fall. Maybe you should just sit back with your pile of stones and wait for the right moment to cast them: when you are without sin.

Personally, I've spent more than 50 years reading, studying, memorizing, preaching, and teaching from the sacred texts. I earned my master's and doctoral degrees at a conservative biblical seminary to better equip myself to \"rightly divide the word of truth.\" I learned Hebrew and Greek to gain a better understanding of the original words of the biblical texts. I studied the lives and times of the biblical authors to help me know what they were saying in their day so I could better apply it to my own.\n \n I'm convinced the Bible has a powerful message for gay and lesbian Christians -- as well as straight Christians. But it's not the message of condemnation we so often hear.\n \n I'm not expecting you to take my word for it, though. I ask only that you'd consider what my research has taught me about the passages used by some people to condemn God's gay and lesbian children. Then decide for yourself...\n \n Most people have not carefully and prayerfully researched the biblical texts often used to condemn God's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender children.\n \n As you may know, biblical ignorance is an epidemic in the United States. A recent study quoted by Dr. Peter Gomes in The Good Book found that 38 percent of Americans polled were certain the Old Testament was written a few years after Jesus' death. Ten percent believed Joan of Arc was Noah's wife. Many even thought the epistles were the wives of the apostles.\n \n This same kind of biblical ignorance is all too present around the topic of homosexuality. Often people who love and trust God's Word have never given careful and prayerful attention to what the Bible does or doesn't say about homosexuality.\n \n For example, many Christians don't know that:\n \n * Jesus says nothing about same-sex behavior.\n * The Jewish prophets are silent about homosexuality.\n * Only six or seven of the Bible's one million verses refer to same-sex behavior in any way -- and none of these verses refer to homosexual orientation as it's understood today.\n \n Most people who are certain they know what the Bible says about homosexuality don't know where the verses that reference same-sex behavior can be found. They haven't read them, let alone studied them carefully. They don't know the original meaning of the words in Hebrew or Greek. And they haven't tried to understand the historical context in which those words were written. Yet the assumption that the Bible condemns homosexuality is passed down from generation to generation with very little personal study or research. The consequences of this misinformation are disastrous, not only for God's gay and lesbian children, but for the entire church.\n \n The apostle Paul says, \"Test all things and hold fast to that which is good.\" By reading this little pamphlet, you are taking Paul seriously.\n \n Historically, people's misinterpretation of the Bible has left a trail of suffering, bloodshed, and death.\n Over the centuries people who misunderstood or misinterpreted the Bible have done terrible things. The Bible has been misused to defend bloody crusades and tragic inquisitions; to support slavery, apartheid, and segregation; to persecute Jews and other non-Christian people of faith; to support Hitler's Third Reich and the Holocaust; to oppose medical science; to condemn interracial marriage; to execute women as witches; and to support the Ku Klux Klan. Shakespeare said it this way: \"Even the devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.\"\n \n We'd like to believe that no person of good will would misuse the Bible to support his or her prejudice. But time and time again it has happened with tragic results.\n \n In the 16th century, John Selden pointed at two Latin words carved into a marble wall in an ancient church in Rome: \"Scrutamini Scripturas,\" which means search the Scriptures. \"These two words,\" Seldon said, \"have undone the world.\"\n \n In one way, John Selden was right. Misusing the Bible has drenched the planet in blood and tears.\n \n But in another way, he was wrong. Most people who misuse the Bible DON'T search the Scriptures. They simply find a text that seems to support their prejudice and then spend the rest of their lives quoting (or misquoting) that text.\n \n The way certain Bible verses are used to condemn homosexuality and homosexuals is a perfect example of this.\n \n On September 22, 2000, a 55-year-old man named Ronald E. Gay, angry for being teased about his last name, entered the Back Street Caf\u00e9 in Roanoke, Virginia, a gathering place for lesbians and gays just a few miles from Lynchburg. Confident that God's Word supported his tragic plan of action, Mr. Gay shouted, \"I am a Christian soldier, working for my Lord.\" Claiming that \"Jesus does not want these people in his heaven,\" he shot seven innocent gay and lesbian people. One man, Danny Overstreet, died instantly. Others still suffer from their physical and psychological wounds.\n \n In July 1999, Matthew Williams and his brother, Tyler, murdered a gay couple, Gary Matson and Winfield Mowder, in their home near Sacramento, California. Speaking to his mother from the Shasta County jail, Matthew explained his actions in this way: \"I had to obey God's law rather than man's law,\" he said. \"I didn't want to do this. I felt I was supposed to. I have followed a higher law... I just plan to defend myself from the Scriptures.\"\n \n After Matthew Shepard was killed in 1998, a pastor in North Carolina published an open letter regarding the trial of Aaron McKinney that read: \"Gays are under the death penalty. His blood is guilty before God (Lev. 20:13). If a person kills a gay, the gay's blood is upon the gay and not upon the hands of the person doing the killing. The acts of gays are so abominable to God. His Word is there and we can't change it.\"\n \n Most of the people I know who say \"the Bible condemns homosexuality\" would never condone these acts. Most Christians have no idea that the people killing gay and lesbian persons go around quoting those few verses of Scripture as justification.\n \n But it's important to hear these stories, because I'm not writing this little pamphlet as a scholarly exercise. It's a matter of life and death. I'm pleading for the lives of my lesbian sisters and gay brothers who are rejected by their friends and families, fired by their employers, denied their civil rights, refused full membership in their churches, and kill themselves or are killed by others -- all on the basis of these six or seven verses.\n \n We must be open to new truth from Scripture.\n \n Even heroes of the Christian faith have changed their minds about the meaning of various biblical texts.\n \n It took a blinding light and a voice from heaven to help the apostle Paul change his mind about certain Hebrew texts. A sheet lowered from the sky filled with all kinds of animals helped the apostle Peter gain new insights into Jewish law.\n \n Jerry Falwell believed the Bible supported segregation in the church until a black shoeshine man asked him, \"When will someone like me be allowed to become a member of your congregation?\" Through those simple words, the Holy Spirit spoke new truth about the ancient biblical texts to the Rev. Falwell, and in obedience he ended segregation at Thomas Road Baptist Church.\n \n Even when we believe the Scriptures are \"infallible\" or \"without error,\" it's terribly dangerous to think that our understanding of every biblical text is also without error. We are human. We are fallible. And we can misunderstand and misinterpret these ancient words -- with tragic results.\n \n Almost 1,000 people believed Jim Jones was a faithful interpreter of God's Word. They died with him in the jungles of Guyana. I studied Jones and leaders of other cults while writing the book and documentary film, Deceived. I found that the only people who were able to break free of the dangerous influence of such Bible-quoting cultic gurus were the ones who took the Bible seriously enough to study the texts themselves and make their own decisions about their meaning. The others \"leave their bones in the desert.\"\n \n What if someone asked you, \"Is there a chance you could be wrong about the way you've interpreted the biblical texts sometimes used to condemn homosexual orientation?\" How would you respond? What does it say about you if you answer, \"No, I could NOT be wrong\"? I am asking you to re-examine these texts -- carefully and prayerfully. Lives hang in the balance.\n \n There are far too many tragic stories of what happens when we fail to study these texts. Mark B. was a young man who accepted his sexual orientation \"until he became a Christian\" and was told on the basis of these texts that he couldn't be both a Christian and a gay man. Mark committed suicide and wrote this suicide note to God: \"I just don't know how else to fix this.\" Mary Lou Wallner, one of our most faithful Soulforce volunteers, was led by these texts to condemn her lesbian daughter, Anna, who hanged herself. Mary Lou now says, \"If I can steer just one person away from the pain and anguish I've been living, then maybe Anna's death will have meaning.\"\n \n If heroes of the Christian faith could change their minds about the meaning of certain biblical texts, shouldn't we be prepared to reconsider our own interpretations of these ancient words when the Holy Spirit opens our minds and hearts to new truth? That's why we study the Bible prayerfully, seeking the Spirit of Truth, God's loving Spirit, to help us understand and apply these words to our lives.\n \n On the night he was betrayed, Jesus told his disciples he was going away from them for a while, but that the Father would send them a \"Comforter,\" an \"Advocate,\" the \"Holy Spirit\" who would \"teach them all things.\"\n \n I believe with all my heart that the Holy Spirit is still teaching us. When we reconsider the texts that are used by some people to condemn God's gay children, we must fervently seek the Holy Spirit's guidance, or we risk being misled by our own prejudices.\n \n The Bible is a book about God -- not a book about human sexuality.\n \n The Bible is the story of God's love for the world and the people of the world. It tells the history of God's love at work rescuing, renewing, and empowering humankind. It was never intended to be a book about human sexuality. Certainly, you will agree.\n \n In fact, the Bible accepts sexual practices that we condemn and condemns sexual practices that we accept. Lots of them! Here are a few examples.\n \n * DEUTERONOMY 22:13-21\n If it is discovered that a bride is not a virgin, the Bible demands that she be executed by stoning immediately.\n * DEUTERONOMY 22:22\n If a married person has sex with someone else's husband or wife, the Bible commands that both adulterers be stoned to death.\n * MARK 10:1-12\n Divorce is strictly forbidden in both Testaments, as is remarriage of anyone who has been divorced.\n * LEVITICUS 18:19\n The Bible forbids a married couple from having sexual intercourse during a woman's period. If they disobey, both shall be executed.\n * MARK 12:18-27\n If a man dies childless, his widow is ordered by biblical law to have intercourse with each of his brothers in turn until she bears her deceased husband a male heir.\n * DEUTERONOMY 25:11-12\n If a man gets into a fight with another man and his wife seeks to rescue her husband by grabbing the enemy's genitals, her hand shall be cut off and no pity shall be shown her.\n \n I'm certain you don't agree with these teachings from the Bible about sex. And you shouldn't. The list goes on: The Bible says clearly that sex with a prostitute is acceptable for the husband but not for the wife. Polygamy (more than one wife) is acceptable, as is a king's having many concubines. (Solomon, the wisest king of all, had 1,000 concubines.) Slavery and sex with slaves, marriage of girls aged 11-13, and treatment of women as property are all accepted practices in the Scriptures. On the other hand, there are strict prohibitions against interracial marriage, birth control, discussing or even naming a sexual organ, and seeing one's parents nude.\n \n Over the centuries the Holy Spirit has taught us that certain Bible verses should not be understood as God's law for all time periods. Some verses are specific to the culture and time they were written, and are no longer viewed as appropriate, wise, or just.\n \n Often, the Holy Spirit uses science to teach us why those ancient words no longer apply to our modern times. During the last three decades, for example, organizations representing 1.5 million U.S. health professionals (doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, and educators) have stated definitively that homosexual orientation is as natural as heterosexual orientation, that sexual orientation is determined by a combination of yet unknown pre- and post-natal influences, and that it is dangerous and inappropriate to tell a homosexual that he or she could or should attempt to change his or her sexual orientation. (See Recommended Resources, p. 23-24.)\n \n While there are some people now living in heterosexual marriages who once perceived themselves to be gay, there are millions of gay and lesbian persons who have accepted their sexual orientation as a gift from God and live productive and deeply spiritual lives. The evidence from science and from the personal experience of gay and lesbian Christians demands that we at least consider whether the passages cited to condemn homosexual behavior should be reconsidered, just as other Bible verses that speak of certain sexual practices are no longer understood as God's law for us in this day.",

   "We miss what these passages say about God when we spend so much time debating what they say about sex.\n \n If the Bible is the story of God's love for the world and not a handbook about sex, then that should shape how we read the Scriptures. So as we take a look at the six biblical texts that are used by some people to condemn homosexuality, let's ask two questions about each of them:\n \n First, what does the text say about God that we need to hear but might be missing?\n \n Second, what might the text be saying about homosexuality?\n \n PASSAGE 1\n GENESIS 2:21-25\n THE CREATION STORY\n \n Let's start \"In the Beginning...\" What does the creation story in Genesis 1-2 say about God?\n \n I'm so tired of reading signs carried by protesters that say: \"It's about Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.\" In fact, the creation story is as important to Adam and Steve as it is Adam and Eve. Gays and non-gays alike need to know and celebrate the truth at the center of this story.\n \n This creation story is primarily about God, a story written to show the power of God who created the world and everything in it. It teaches us that ultimately God is our Creator, that God shaped us, and that God said, \"It's good.\" Isn't this the heart of the text?\n \n Now what does the creation story say about homosexuality? Because the text says it is \"natural\" that a man and a woman come together to create a new life, some people think this means gay or lesbian couples are \"unnatural.\" They read this interpretation into the text, even though the text is silent about all kinds of relationships that don't lead to having children:\n \n * couples who are unable to have children\n * couples who are too old to have children\n * Anti-gay protestcouples who choose not to have children\n * people who are single\n \n Are these relationships (or lack of relationships) \"unnatural\"? There's nothing said here that condemns or approves the love that people of the same sex have for each other, including the love I have for my partner, Gary.\n \n So I believe the creation story says a lot about God's power and presence in the universe -- but nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today.\n \n \n PASSAGE 2\n GENESIS 19:1-14\n THE STORY OF SODOM\n \n Now let's consider the second biblical text used by some people to condemn God's gay children. You remember the ancient story of Sodom. First, what does the story of Sodom in Genesis 19 say about God?\n \n When Gary and I arrive at a college or university to speak, there are often protesters carrying signs that read, \"Mel White, Sodomite.\" (Has a nice ring to it.) Actually, I'm not from Sodom. That city was buried beneath the Dead Sea centuries ago. I'm from California -- but perhaps that just confirms their suspicions!\n \n Once again, this story is not primarily about sex. It is primarily about God. Some people say the city of Sodom was destroyed because it was overrun by sexually obsessed homosexuals. In fact, the city of Sodom had been doomed to destruction long before. So what is this passage really about?\n \n Jesus and five Old Testament prophets all speak of the sins that led to the destruction of Sodom -- and not one of them mentions homosexuality. Even Billy Graham doesn't mention homosexuality when he preaches on Sodom.\n \n Listen to what Ezekiel 16:48-49 tell us: \"This is the sin of Sodom; she and her suburbs had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not help or encourage the poor and needy. They were arrogant and this was abominable in God's eyes.\"\n \n Today, heterosexuals and homosexuals alike do well to remember that we break God's heart when we spend all we earn on ourselves, when we forget the poor and hungry, when we refuse to do justice or show mercy, when we leave strangers at the gate.\n \n I admit, there are a lot of gay folk who are Sodomites (and a lot of straight folk as well). Sodomites are rich and don't share what they have with the poor. Sodomites have plenty and want more. While millions are hungry, homeless, and sick, Sodomites rush to build bigger homes, buy bigger cars, and own more property -- putting their trust in safer stock portfolios and more secure retirement accounts.\n \n Whatever teaching about sexuality you might get out of this passage, be sure to hear this central, primary truth about God as well. God has called us do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with our Creator. Sodom was destroyed because its people didn't take God seriously about caring for the poor, the hungry, the homeless, or the outcast.\n \n But what does the story of Sodom say about homosexual orientation as we understand it today? Nothing.\n \n It was common for soldiers, thieves, and bullies to rape a fallen enemy, asserting their victory by dehumanizing and demeaning the vanquished. This act of raping an enemy is about power and revenge, not about homosexuality or homosexual orientation. And it is still happening.\n \n In August 1997, Abner Louima, a young black immigrant from Haiti, was assaulted by several police officers after he was arrested in Brooklyn. Officer Charles Schwarz held Louima down in a restroom at the precinct, while Officer Justin Volpe rammed a broken stick into Louima's rectum. These two men and the three other officers involved in this incident and its cover-up were not gay. This was not a homosexual act. It was about power.\n \n The sexual act that occurs in the story of Sodom is a gang rape -- and homosexuals oppose gang rape as much as anyone. That's why I believe the story of Sodom says a lot about God's will for each of us, but nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today.\n \n PASSAGE 3\n LEVITICUS 18:22 AND 20:13\n THE HOLINESS CODE\n \n Let's move on. What do the two verses sometimes cited from Leviticus say about God?\n \n Leviticus 18:6 reads: \"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female. It is an abomination.\" A similar verse occurs two chapters later, in Leviticus 20:13: \"A man who sleeps with another man is an abomination and should be executed.\" On the surface, these words could leave you feeling rather uneasy, especially if you are gay. But just below the surface is the deeper truth about God -- and it has nothing to do with sex.\n \n Leviticus is a holiness code written 3,000 years ago. This code includes many of the outdated sexual laws we mentioned earlier, and a lot more. It also includes prohibitions against round haircuts, tattoos, working on the Sabbath, wearing garments of mixed fabrics, eating pork or shellfish, getting your fortune told, and even playing with the skin of a pig. (There goes football!)\n \n So what's a holiness code? It's a list of behaviors that people of faith find offensive in a certain place and time. In this case, the code was written for priests only, and its primary intent was to set the priests of Israel over and against priests of other cultures.\n \n At the age of 10, I signed a holiness code written by the Women's Christian Temperance Union that said I would never taste beer, wine, or liquor. I thought signing it would please God and my grandmother. That's a holiness code. When I was in high school we evangelical Christians had an unwritten holiness code that went like this: \"I don't drink, smoke, or chew, or go with girls who do.\" Now I know what you're thinking. That last part about \"girls who do\" proved especially easy for me. But the point is that I obeyed this evangelical holiness code because my parents said that breaking these rules didn't please God, and I knew it didn't please them.\n \n We had another evangelical holiness code while I was in high school that prohibited dancing. I was student body president, yet I refused to go to the prom because I had promised not to dance. I did this to please God and my mother -- whose mother had made her sign a holiness code that she wouldn't go to dances either.\n \n What about this word abomination that comes up in both passages? In Hebrew, \"abominations\" (TO'EBAH) are behaviors that people in a certain time and place consider tasteless or offensive. To the Jews an abomination was not a law, not something evil like rape or murder forbidden by the Ten Commandments. It was a common behavior by non-Jews that Jews thought was displeasing to God.\n \n Jesus and Paul both said the holiness code in Leviticus does not pertain to Christian believers. Nevertheless, there are still people who pull the two verses about men sleeping together from this ancient holiness code to say that the Bible seems to condemn homosexuality.\n \n But wait, before we go any further, let's ask: What does this text say about God? Even if the old holiness codes no longer apply to us as Christians, it's important to remember that in every age, people of faith are responsible for setting moral and ethical standards that honor God. But we people of faith must be very careful not to allow our own prejudices to determine what those standards should be.\n \n Instead of selecting one item from an ancient Jewish holiness code and using it to condemn sexual or gender minorities, let's talk together about setting sexual standards that please God -- standards appropriate for heterosexuals and homosexuals alike, standards based on loving concern, health, and wholeness for ourselves and for others.\n \n Now what do the Leviticus passages say about homosexuality?\n \n I'm convinced those passages say nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today. Here's why. Consider this single Bible passage that was used for centuries to condemn masturbation:\n \n \"He spilled his seed on the ground... And the thing which Onan did displeased the Lord: wherefore he slew him also\" (Genesis 38:9-10).\n \n For Jewish writers of Scripture, a man sleeping with another man was an abomination. But it was also an abomination (and one worthy of death) to masturbate or even to interrupt coitus (to halt sex with your spouse before ejaculation as an act of birth control). Why were these sexual practices considered abominations by Scripture writers in these ancient times?\n \n Because the Hebrew pre-scientific understanding was that the male semen contained the whole of life. With no knowledge of eggs and ovulation, it was assumed that the man's sperm contained the whole child and that the woman provided only the incubating space. Therefore, the spilling of semen without possibility of having a child was considered murder.\n \n The Jews were a small tribe struggling to populate a country. They were outnumbered by their enemy. You can see why these ancient people felt it was an abomination to risk \"wasting\" even a single child. But the passage says nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today.\n \n We've talked about the passages in the Hebrew Scriptures that are used (or misused) by some people to condemn sexual minorities. Now let's look at three verses from the letters of the apostle Paul in the Christian Scriptures that are used the same way. Remember: First, we'll ask what the text says about God; second, we'll consider what it may or may not say about sexual orientation.\n \n PASSAGE 4\n ROMANS 1:26-27\n NATURAL AND UNNATURAL\n \n What does Romans 1:26-27 say about God?\n \n For our discussion, this is the most controversial biblical passage of them all. In Romans 1:26-27 the apostle Paul describes non-Jewish women who exchange \"natural use for unnatural\" and non-Jewish men who \"leave the natural use of women, working shame with each other.\"\n \n This verse appears to be clear: Paul sees women having sex with women and men having sex with men, and he condemns that practice. But let's go back 2,000 years and try to understand why.\n \n Paul is writing this letter to Rome after his missionary tour of the Mediterranean. On his journey Paul had seen great temples built to honor Aphrodite, Diana, and other fertility gods and goddesses of sex and passion instead of the one true God the apostle honors. Apparently, these priests and priestesses engaged in some odd sexual behaviors -- including castrating themselves, carrying on drunken sexual orgies, and even having sex with young temple prostitutes (male and female) -- all to honor the gods of sex and pleasure.\n \n The Bible is clear that sexuality is a gift from God. Our Creator celebrates our passion. But the Bible is also clear that when passion gets control of our lives, we're in deep trouble.\n \n When we live for pleasure, when we forget that we are God's children and that God has great dreams for our lives, we may end up serving the false gods of sex and passion, just as they did in Paul's time. In our obsession with pleasure, we may even walk away from the God who created us -- and in the process we may cause God to abandon all the great dreams God has for our lives.\n \n Did these priests and priestesses get into these behaviors because they were lesbian or gay? I don't think so. Did God abandon them because they were practicing homosexuals? No. Read the text again.\n \n In our Soulforce video, There's a Wideness in God's Mercy, the Rev. Dr. Louis B. Smedes, a distinguished Christian author and ethicist, describes exactly how the Bible says these promiscuous priests and priestesses got into this mess. Once again it has nothing to do with homosexuality:\n \n SMEDES: \"The people Paul had in mind refused to acknowledge and worship God, and for this reason were abandoned by God. And being abandoned by God, they sank into sexual depravity.\"\n \n SMEDES: \"The homosexuals I know have not rejected God at all; they love God and they thank God for his grace and his gifts. How, then, could they have been abandoned to homosexuality as a punishment for refusing to acknowledge God?\"\n \n SMEDES: \"Nor have the homosexuals that I know given up heterosexual passions for homosexual lusts. They have been homosexual from the moment of their earliest sexual stirrings. They did not change from one orientation to another; they just discovered that they were homosexual. It would be unnatural for most homosexuals to have heterosexual sex.\"\n \n SMEDES: \"And the homosexual people I know do not lust after each other any more than heterosexual people do... their love for one another is likely to be just as spiritual and personal as any heterosexual love can be.\"\n \n Thank you, Dr. Smedes. (To get a copy of the video featuring Dr. Smedes, There's a Wideness in God's Mercy, visit Soulforce : Freedom for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People.)\n \n Getting to know a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender person of faith will help you realize that it is unreasonable (and unjust) to compare our love for each other to the rituals of the priests and priestesses who pranced around the statues of Aphrodite and Diana. Once again, I feel certain this passage says a lot about God, but nothing about homosexuality as we understand it.\n \n You'll also note that Romans 2 begins with \"Therefore, [referring to Romans 1], you have no excuse, whoever you are, when you judge others; for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself...\" Even after he describes the disturbing practices he has seen, Paul warns us that judging others is God's business, not ours.\n \n PASSAGES 5 AND 6\n 1 CORINTHIANS 6:9 AND 1 TIMOTHY 1:10\n THE MYSTERY OF \"MALOKOIS\" AND \"ARSENOKOITAI\"\n \n Now what do the writings of Paul in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10 say, first, about God, and then about homosexuality? These are the last two places in the Bible that seem to refer to same-sex behavior. We can combine them because they are so similar.\n \n Moses holding the ten commandmentsPaul is exasperated. The Christians in Ephesus and Corinth are fighting among themselves. (Sound familiar?) In Corinth they're even suing one another in secular courts. Paul shouts across the distance, \"You are breaking God's heart by the way you are treating one another.\"\n \n Like any good writer, Paul anticipates their first question: \"Well, how are we supposed to treat one another?\" Paul answers, \"You know very well how to treat one another from the Jewish law written on tablets of stone.\"\n \n The Jewish law was created by God to help regulate human behavior. To remind the churches in Corinth and Ephesus how God wants us to treat one another, Paul recites examples from the Jewish law first. Don't kill one another. Don't sleep with a person who is married to someone else. Don't lie or cheat or steal. The list goes on to include admonitions against fornication, idolatry, whoremongering, perjury, drunkenness, revelry, and extortion. He also includes \"malokois\" and \"arsenokoitai.\"\n \n Here's where the confusion begins. What's a malokois? What's an arsenokoitai? Actually, those two Greek words have confused scholars to this very day. We'll say more about them later, when we ask what the texts say about sex. But first let's see what the texts say about God.\n \n After quoting from the Jewish law, Paul reminds the Christians in Corinth that they are under a new law: the law of Jesus, a law of love that requires us to do more than just avoid murder, adultery, lying, cheating, and stealing. Paul tells them what God wants is not strict adherence to a list of laws, but a pure heart, a good conscience, and a faith that isn't phony.\n \n That's the lesson we all need to learn from these texts. God doesn't want us squabbling over who is \"in\" and who is \"out.\" God wants us to love one another. It's God's task to judge us. It is NOT our task to judge one another.\n \n So what do these two texts say about homosexuality? Are gays and lesbians on that list of sinners in the Jewish law that Paul quotes to make an entirely different point?\n \n Greek scholars say that in first century the Greek word malaokois probably meant \"effeminate call boys.\" The New Revised Standard Version says \"male prostitutes.\"\n \n As for arsenokoitai, Greek scholars don't know exactly what it means -- and the fact that we don't know is a big part of this tragic debate. Some scholars believe Paul was coining a name to refer to the customers of \"the effeminate call boys.\" We might call them \"dirty old men.\" Others translate the word as \"sodomites,\" but never explain what that means.\n \n In 1958, for the first time in history, a person translating that mysterious Greek word into English decided it meant homosexuals, even though there is, in fact, no such word in Greek or Hebrew. But that translator made the decision for all of us that placed the word homosexual in the English-language Bible for the very first time.\n \n In the past, people used Paul's writings to support slavery, segregation, and apartheid. People still use Paul's writings to oppress women and limit their role in the home, in church, and in society.\n \n Now we have to ask ourselves, \"Is it happening again?\" Is a word in Greek that has no clear definition being used to reflect society's prejudice and condemn God's gay children?\n \n We all need to look more closely at that mysterious Greek word arsenokoitai in its original context. I find most convincing the argument from history that Paul is condemning the married men who hired hairless young boys (malakois) for sexual pleasure just as they hired smooth-skinned young girls for that purpose.\n \n Responsible homosexuals would join Paul in condemning anyone who uses children for sex, just as we would join anyone else in condemning the threatened gang rape in Sodom or the behavior of the sex-crazed priests and priestesses in Rome. So, once again, I am convinced that this passage says a lot about God, but nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today.\n \n The biblical authors are silent about homosexual orientation as we know it today. They neither approve it nor condemn it.\n \n We've looked closely at the six biblical texts used by some people to condemn homosexuality. But we must also remember that Jesus, the Jewish prophets, and even Paul never even comment on the responsible love a gay man or lesbian feels for another.\n \n The Bible is completely silent on the issue of homosexual orientation. And no wonder. Homosexual orientation wasn't even known until the 19th century.\n \n The discovery that some of us are created and/or shaped in our earliest infancy toward same-gender attraction was made in the last 150 years. Biblical authors knew nothing about sexual orientation. Old Testament authors and Paul assumed all people were created heterosexual, just as they believed the earth was flat,\n that there were heavens above and hell below, and that the sun moved up and down.\n \n In 1864, almost 3,000 years after Moses and at least 18 centuries after the apostle Paul, the German social scientist Karl Heinrich Ulrichs was the first to declare that homosexuals were a distinct class of individuals. It was a big moment for all sexual minorities. It's our Columbus discovering the New World. It's our Madame Curie discovering radium used for Xrays. It's our Neil Armstrong walking on the moon. It may seem like one small step for the rest of you, but it's a giant leap for us.\n \n Ulrichs assured the world of what we who are homosexual already know in our hearts. We aren't just heterosexuals choosing to perform same-sex behaviors. We are a whole class of people whose drive to same-sex intimacy is at the very core of our being from the very beginning of our lives.\n \n Although the word homosexual was not used for the first time until later in the 19th century, Ulrichs recognized that homosexuals had been around from the beginning of recorded time, that we were \"innately different from heterosexuals,\" and that our desire for same-sex intimacy and affiliation is intrinsic, natural, inborn and/or shaped in earliest infancy. According to Dr. Ulrichs, what may have looked \"unnatural\" to Moses and Paul was in fact \"natural\" to homosexuals.\n \n So this is my sixth premise. The Biblical authors knew nothing of homosexual orientation as we understand it, and therefore said nothing to condemn or approve it.\n \n The authors of the Bible are authorities in matters of faith. They can be trusted when they talk about God. But they should not be considered the final authorities on sexual orientation any more than they are the final authorities on space travel, gravity, or the Internet.\n \n Since the writers of Scripture are not the final authorities on human sexuality, since they didn't even know about sexual orientation as we understand it today, since Jesus and the Jewish prophets were silent about any kind of same-sex behavior, I am persuaded that the Bible has nothing in it to approve or condemn homosexual orientation as we understand it.\n \n Although the prophets, Jesus, and other biblical authors say nothing about homosexual orientation as we understand it today, they are clear about one thing: As we search for truth, we are to \"love one another.\"\n \n We may not be able to use the Bible as our final authority on sexual orientation. But as we search for the truth, we can and should use the Bible as our final authority on how we should treat one another along the way.\n \n A young Jewish scholar asked Jesus, \"What is the greatest commandment?\" Quoting the prophets, Jesus replied, \"The great commandment is this... to love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and the second command is like it, to love your neighbor as you love yourself.\"\n \n \"This is my commandment,\" Jesus said, \"that you love one another, as I have loved you.\" On this the Bible is explicitly clear. Even if we disagree about what the Bible seems to say about homosexuality, we can agree that above all else we are commanded by the Scriptures to love God and to love one another.\n \n Since God is the God of truth, since Jesus himself told us that the truth would set us free, one way that we love God and love one another is by seeking the truth about sexual orientation wherever we can find it.\n \n There is a growing body of evidence from science, psychology, history, psychiatry, medicine, and personal experience that leads to a clear verdict: Homosexuality is neither a sickness nor a sin. Unfortunately, the church has always been slow, if not the last institution on earth, to accept new truth.\n \n In 1632 the scientist Galileo (who was a man of faith) dared to support the radical 15th-century idea of Copernicus that all planets, including the earth, revolve around the sun. Immediately, Galileo was proclaimed a heretic by the Pope who quoted Scriptures in his attempt to disprove what science was proving.\n \n Earlier, Protestant heroes had joined in quoting Scriptures condemning Copernicus. These weren't evil men. But they couldn't admit that the Bible was a book about God, not about astronomy -- just as good men and women today have trouble admitting that the Bible is a book about God, not about human sexuality.\n \n Martin Luther said, \"This fool Copernicus wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy; but sacred Scripture in Joshua 10:13 tells us that Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, and not the earth.\"\n \n John Calvin quoted Psalm 93 in his attack on Copernicus. \"The earth also is established. It cannot be moved.\" Calvin added, \"Who will venture to place the authority of Copernicus above that of the Holy Spirit?\"\n \n Melancthon, one of Luther's closest allies, used Ecclesiastes 1:4-5 to condemn Copernicus. \"The sun also rises, and the sun goes down and hurries to the place from which it came.\" Then he added these dangerous words: \"It is the part of a good mind to accept the truth as revealed by God and to obey it.\" In other words, believe what the Bible says -- even if science disproves it.\n \n Because Christians refused to let their understanding of God's Word be informed by science, Copernicus was condemned and Galileo was declared a heretic and placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life. In 1992, 359 years later, Pope John Paul II finally admitted the church had been wrong to ignore science and to interpret the Bible literally.\n \n The Pope said something we must never forget: \"Recent historical studies enable us to state that this sad misunderstanding now belongs to the past.\" Unfortunately, the apology came too late to relieve Galileo of his suffering. What if the biblical scholars of Galileo's day had said to Galileo, \"We don't agree with your Copernican theories, but we love and trust you. As long as you love God and seek God's will in your life, you are welcome here.\"\n \n Imagine the suffering that could be avoided if the church could say this to their lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender children: \"We don't understand your views about sexual orientation, but we love and trust you. As long as you love God and seek God's will in your life, you are welcome here.\"\n \n Instead, well-intentioned Christians are driving their own children away from the church, using Scripture passages that may not even pertain to sexual orientation as we understand it.\n \n Whatever some people believe the Bible says about homosexuality, they must not use that belief to deny homosexuals their basic civil rights. To discriminate against sexual or gender minorities is unjust and un-American.\n \n Please consider one last thing. I love the Bible. I read God's Word in it and hear God's Word through it. But the United States is not a nation governed by the Bible. Our nation is governed by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Our laws were created to protect an individual's right to disagree. If the Bible (or someone's view of the Bible) replaces the Constitution as the law of the land, we undermine the great foundation upon which this country was built.\n \n When I was a guest on a talk show in Seattle, I saw what might happen to me and to millions like me if a genuine literalist gained political power over this country. The other guest on the show was an independent Presbyterian pastor. When I told him that I was gay, he said without hesitation, \"Then you should be killed.\" A Christian brother sentenced me to death, guided only by his literal understanding of Leviticus 20:13.\n \n I asked him, \"Who should do the killing, you church folk?\" He answered, \"No, that's the civil authorities' job. That's why we need to elect more good men of God into government.\" I sat there in stunned silence, until he added, \"I know it must be hard for you to hear it, Dr. White -- but God said it first and it's our job to obey.\"\n \n I hope we can agree that all of us must stand together against those who would replace the Constitution with biblical law. That's why, when I lecture on a university campus, I carry a Bible in one pocket and a Constitution in the other.\n \n Can we support full civil rights for all... even if we disagree?\n \n In this last premise, I'm asking you who disagree with my stand on homosexuality to support my stand on full civil rights for all people, including gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Americans.\n \n I hope you'll agree that we are family, all sisters and brothers of the same heavenly parent. We may be different, but we can still live together in peace.\n \n Thanks for reading this pamphlet. I'm grateful.

Or has that gone over your head as well?\n\n \n NO Jason, you were making a direct statement that I also have sexual perversions which go against Gods word as if that would somehow exonerate your sins against Him. You will find that God judges us as individuals on that day, not as a group.\n \n \nGod made him in his Image but gave us free will. Also I am comparing us to animals due to some very specific and basic functions we and animals hare together. The Old Testament condemned the act of homosexuality as a practice and sacrifice to other gods Archie. And no Archie the bible must be taken with a grain of salt and reproach.\n\n \n WOW, your ignorance and desire to compromise Gods truths for your personal sinful convenience is mind boggling. Yes Jason, God gave us free will, but not freedom to sin and rebel against Him with impunity. That's the whole point of A&Es fall from grace story, dontya know? \n \n And as for comparing us to animals, do they need to get saved in order to go to heaven? Does the bible teach that animals are in rebellion against God as Man is? Does anything in the bible place animals on equal terms with humanity as creatures regarding our personal relationship with God? Were animals created for fellowship as we were or given the aforementioned free will you admit that we have in the very paragraph I'm responding to now? \n \n Have you no ability to honestly consider the lies you are telling yourself in order to justify the blatant rebellion you are carrying out against Gods will?\n \n \nArchie with all due respect, you can;t change who you are.\n\n \n Nor would I want to.

I am not lost Archie, for once I am actually happy and know that god created me this way and that he loves me no matter what.\n\n \n You're right about one thing Jason, and that is that God does love you, and just as you are, no less. But the whole point of you loving Him back is allowing Him to remake you in His image. That requires sincere submission and trust in His authority over your life. That is the evidence of being born again. You would listen to that still small voice which is convicting you of your sin rather than ignoring Him and screaming out that you are right in your rebellion against His will for your life. And it is my expression of christian love for you that I share this truth with you without compromising the truth in order for you to like me now. \n \n My preference is that you hear my words and we can laugh about this in 10,000 years in Heaven. But that future is yours alone to choose, and if you spend your life defending homosexuality rather than the Lord who died for your sins, then you will have made your choice and it wont be Jesus you have chosen.
