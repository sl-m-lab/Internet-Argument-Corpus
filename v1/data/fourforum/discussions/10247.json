In fact, religion has been at least as intrusive in the past into public policy as it is now. Just think--it went unchecked in many cases, from prohibition to inserting references to God into pledges and coinage. And then there's the fact prayers have been included in congressional gatherings. There are even references to God in govt. documents. There are many such historical examples. If the degree of aggressive atheism is proportional to the amount of intrusion there is of religion into public policy, there should be no more, and perhaps even less aggressive atheism going on right now than ever.

If we're not living on a flat earth, then the argument falls short. What was good for people thousands of years ago can be found wanting today. If God exists, there really ought to be some independent corroborative evidence. Ancient testimony for a God/gods won't do, just as ancient testimony of a flat earth won't do. And we know that appealing to numbers is not valid argument. ;) \n \n Atheists can't see any evidence for God.

   "... This is why I am not happy, I am an atheist in the sense I do not believe in gods, but I am convinced no atheist can provide proof of their nonexistance.\n\n I don't think that's in dispute. Sometimes the problem arises in general understanding of terminology. Should we always be absolutely precise by dictionary definition as to the meanings of words, or is there natural scope to employ normal parlance? E.g. There is no God.\n \n One person may mean that they haven't seen any evidence for such a belief, and therefore states that there is no God. Normal parlance. Another means precisely that, There is no God (suggesting proof for the assertion).\n \n We all do well to assure ourselves of the context in which something has been written, for ourselves, as well as for our debating opponent. :)",

   "From the Handbook of Logical Fallacies:\nPROVING A NEGATIVE - (The Objectivist Newsletter, April 1963) \n \n \"Proving the non-existence of that for which no evidence of any kind exists. Proof, logic, reason, thinking, knowledge pertain to and deal only with that which exists. They cannot be applied to that which does not exist. Nothing can be relevant or applicable to the non-existent. The non-existent is nothing. A positive statement, based on facts that have been erroneously interpreted, can be refuted - by means of exposing the errors in the interpretation of the facts. Such refutation is the disproving of a positive, not the proving of a negative.... Rational demonstration is necessary to support even the claim that a thing is possible. It is a breach of logic to assert that that which has not been proven to be impossible is, therefore, possible. An absence does not constitute proof of anything. Nothing can be derived from nothing.\" \n \n \n If I say, \"Anything is possible\" I must admit the possibility that the statement I just made is false. \n \n Doubt must always be specific, and can only exist in contrast to things which cannot properly be doubted.\n http://www.rkba.org/libertarian/king/Fallacies",
