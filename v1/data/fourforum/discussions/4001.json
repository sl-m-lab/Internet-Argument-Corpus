There are more working people with democratic ideals (a fair shake, jobs, unions, etc.) and guided by mythological belief systems than those with the brains/education to accomplish their desires without assistance. Bush made broad appeals to the working class with self-defeating tax cuts, social engineering in the form of federal legislation of education, the workers current babysitter, and the current favorite of religion's carrot and stick approach.

Wide eyed college graduates will beat down your door, willing to work for next to nothing, willing to do anything.\n \n\n \n Not all that long ago the college a graduate attended was not a major consideration for employment in the general scheme of things, the sciences aside. There were few scholarships awarded to people less than truly academically gifted, no federal loans and certainly no fail/pass grading system. With some exceptions, easily determined, when you hired a college grad you employed an individual who had proven he/she had the desire to face and overcome obstacles of a personal nature and those imposed by a society that used that level of education to sift out all but those capable of facing and meeting challenges. Decision makers.\n \n It would be interesting to determine how many college grads from the past two decades worked full-time while attending college full-time and then worked each summer at a job paying the most they could achieve, usually seasonal, to get book and tuition money for the next year. Or what the number of college grads would currently be without federal loan guarantees defaulted in a great many cases, pass/fail grading systems and AA activity.\n \n And, of course, there's the current quality of our educational system. Or are those reports I'm reading of current college grads having the same lack of basic reading and math skills they achieved at the high school level not true? And that trade schools other than doing hair and nails have virtually disappeared from our society because of the need for everyone to have a college degree of questionable value?",

Of course not.\n\n \n Not going to argue this one with you since I think both of those are a complete waste of time anyway. \n \n \n A liberal would want exposure to more disciplines than just the one they will perform at their job..i.e. more well-rounded, and thus, better able to think critically, reason, understand psychological manipulation (marketing, salary negotiation, etc.), less able to know what's a good and bad deal (negotation of salary, the knowledge that they could start their own business with their present skill-set, etc.).\n\n \n The problem is that the things you just listed cannot for the most part be taught. They are acquired through experience. I have seen a great many fresh behind the ears job applicants, even those with MBAs negotiate themselves salaries below what I was even considering offering as base pay, and walk out of the office happy with their accomplishment.\n \n Most people couldn't start a business with their present skill set. This is why over 95% of startups fail in the first 5 years. \n \n \nI see the primary determiniants being:\n 1. Supply of a particular type of job\n 2. Employers hiring criteria for that type of job (which I assume includes education)\n 3. Individual choice as to what skills they obtain\n \n Liberal or conservative is irrelevant here as a cause.\n\n \n No, it is not irrelevant. Our liberal \"one size fits all\" school system has excelled at cranking out medicre high school graduates, who move on to be medeocre college students using federally susidized loans to become the nex crop of unskilled management. \n \n \nI hire for a similar skill set (does not require advanced degree, but is highly specialized and technical), the demand is fairly low, the pay is high. This is a result of supply and demand. If machinists were needed more, there would be more. Don't blame that on liberals, it's supply and demand and the other two above points.\n \n \n This is where you are wrong. We are running a MAJOR deficit in production workers and skilled labor, the department of labor puts it at over 10 million. We operate our social indoctorination centers (high schools) soley for the purpose of grooming these kids for college, then we insure that they can get into college for free or next to it, thus ensuring that they will do so, since college has become the easy way out. Less than 5% of college students hold a full time job. Less than 20% have any job at all while they are in school.\n \n \nIf a machinist wants to go get a job as a programmer, they cannot.\n \n \n Absolutly wrong. The ability of a machinest to program (especially Gcode and automation realted programming) is an absolute must in modern production facilities. \n \n \nAn electrical engineer, with what amounts to a minor by many standards in programming, can.\n \n \n Pls explain how an electrcal engineer has waht amounts to a minor in programming? Is this because they can use Autocads electrical desktop? Thats not programming. thats not even CLOSE to programming.\n \n \nWhen an electrical engineer is asked to be more productive through automation, they can, they have the skills. A machinist is not necessary so trained. If an electrical engineer is asked to write a paper describing their inventions origin, construction, and application, they apply their technical writing training. A machinists, good with a lathe, will not necessarily have these skills. I submit that the education matches the job.\n\n \n Again, an experienced machinist can do all that you listed above, and do a better job of it than an engineer. 2 years ago I did a little experiment. I took a machinist with 20+ years of experience in a prototyping/production environment and put him in charge of my engineering department. Efficincy went through the roof and suddenly the design realted problems we would routinely have (and most places have) vanished. There is a world of difference between being able to \"do it on paper\" and actually being able to produce something. Making it work on paper is an entirely worthless skill unless your ideas and designes can be produced in the real world.\n \n Ford has recently done soemthign similar. Every one of their design teams is now either headed by or required to consult with a mechanic. The mechanics are the best ford could find. They are front line guys out of their dealerships. These are the guys who know what works and what doesn't in a vehicle, and know exactly what to look for as far as later service requirements. \n \n The days of a mechanic being a grease monkey and a machinest being some illiterate XXXXX are over. I have a brother who is a mechanic (ford). HE took a 2 years program offered by ford (called the asset program). This is his second year as a full mechanic in a dealership and he cleared over $80,000.00 this year. Pretty good considering the other kids that he went to high school with who went on to a traditional college are just now getting out, and their average entry level job will likely pay around $35,000.00, and they will cap out (on average) at about $60,000.00.\n \n Mechanics anymore are required to have a good understanding of electronic and computerised systems, programming, even materials testing. A good machinest anymore will know more about motion control programming than most programmers and can CAD in their sleep.\n \n \n \nYes. All philosopher-kings. To want people to remain ignorant is not a good thing IMO.\n I disagree about hands-dirty, that's a red herring. Many people choose a life that involves repetitive work or hands-on types of work, not out of necessity, but through pursuit of their dreams.\n\n \n I am not talking about people remaining idgnorant. I am talking abotu loading them up with worthless educations. Big difference. \n \n \n \nNo, supply and demand. With the way markets shift, having a highly specialized degree, when it's not necessary, is a poor choice. Further, good foundational skills for certain jobs is required. Business is a tad more open ended than machining, as are certain engineer tasks, and because of this having a broader foundation gives them the tools they need to find solutions.\n\n \n But it doesn't giver them more options, it limits those options. Quite trying to turn everybody into well educated monkeys. Let enough folks become production workers, then they can pursue higher education if they feel it is warranted (and in most cases their employer will pay for it).\n \n \n \nHow dare you!! A conservative declaring that employees are inefficient, overmanaged, because of liberal teachers and not because of ineffective managers, leadership, and training? You got busted on that one :) The managers are ultimately the ones responsible, you know that, I think your contempt for the fuzzy notion of \"liberal\" made you state that. There are no excuses, only laziness and achievement.\n\n \n No, I didn't get \"busted\" this is simply the way it is. At one time, management knew fullw ell that the entire purpose of management was to support the production line workers and the sales department. Anything beyond that was a bonus. Without production and sales, you have nothing. The new thought process is that production workers and sales exist to support ever deepening layers of management. theya re actually teaching this in business schools. We have abandoned the tried and true business models for this idiotic new model.\n \n \n \nNo. Sound economic theory is allowing market forces to do the work. If your employee is better than his chief, she should be made chief. If your employee is worse than your chief, but still wants to be chief, you have an exmployee that is exhibiting unsound reasoning, or rather, reasoning that sacrifices what's best for the business, for their own selfish needs. Perhaps they don't have a good foundation of knowledge to understand that with achievement comes reward...a conservative principle if there ever was one.\n\n \n Unfortunatly that is no longer the case. As misguided a beliefe as it may be, there are a lot of folks out there that feel that a college degree can somhow make up for skill and experience. This is not the case. You can certainly replace an educated man with an experienced one (and in most cases this is a good idea if you can). Tryign to do it the other way around is a sure invitation to disaster.\n \n \nRealistically, if our education system was literally a root cause of an eventual failure of the economy, I'd agree. But it's been the opposite so far.\n\n \n how has it been the opposite? The change in our education syestem took place (primarily) in the early to mid 60's. Since the early to mid 60's, our production numbers have been in steady decline, until we have reached the point where our industrial infrastructer is GONE. This has been because of a decline in the availabilty of qualified production workers, which has driven labor costs through the roof. Instead of production workers outnumbering management (which is the way american industry used to operate), management now outnumbers production workers nearly 3 to 1 in most companies.",
