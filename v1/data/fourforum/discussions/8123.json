Looks like the GOP is falling behind some on keeping up the token support for votes. Tsk, tsk. \n \n \nDobson cited the House's actions on two measures that passed over the objections of social conservatives: a hate crime bill that extended protections to gay people and increased support for embryonic stem cell research.\n\n \n Does this mean they are FOR gay bashing? How can this be anything close to Christianity?",

   "They are either going for an incredibly shrewd maneuver, or they are just plain clueless...\n \n Right now, the republicans are having a HUGE disapproval problem. One poll I saw stated that the \"poll's\" support for democrats over republicans was the largest that they had ever seen in the history of asking the American public to compare the republicans to democrats. People in this country are really dissatisfied with the way this country is being run, and the Republican dominated house, senate, and executive branch are a neon arrow for perception on which party to blame...\n \n It could be incredibly shrewd in that the religious right might be hoping to withhold a perceived \"life-line\" in voting power. If they can get some action out of the Republicans before the election in exchange for the promise of religious right votes, that would be \"shrewd\"...\n \n On the flip side, the things that people are annoyed about towards the president and congress (looking at the polls) ARE NOT the focus of the religious right. Gas prices. War in Iraq. etc...\n \n If Republicans realize that catering to the religious right at this stage will only annoy voters who want REAL action on REAL issues, then they may play hard-ball with religious right voters who would be better off with Republicans over the alternative.\n (i.e. Take what you get or the people that are going to replace us are going to give you less...)\n \n \n Quite frankly, I think the religious right has been too pompous on numerous issues in the public perception. They boasted about how they were going to get some Supreme Court justices after the last presidential election. If that doesn't scream impropriety, I don't know what does...\n \n (Hmmm. A little bit off the topic... )\n \n \n But anyways, I think it's funny that the religious right are playing into the hands of requesting the political \"carrot\" that will be dangled in front of their nose, but never given. Isn't it interesting how the marriage amendment was made a big deal before last election, and now it looks like people are trying to bring it up again before this upcoming congressional election???\n \n And as a side-note, REPEATED polls on the FMA demonstrate a majority DO NOT WANT discrimination coded into our federal constitution.\n http://www.washblade.com/2006/5-11/news/national/opposed.cfm\n \n (And on another note, the whole \"hate crimes\" issue for gays also has a majority supporting the legislation. But I imagine the religious right members screaming for the \"majority opinion\" to rule out don't give a damn when the ball is not in their court...\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_poll3.htm )\n \n And on another level, do the Republicans REALLY want another failure on the gay marriage amendment hanging over their heads, perhaps giving an image of ineffectual leadership, before they go up for re-election? Adding to potential views of failure on the gas hikes and Iraq war issues?",
