   "Apparently, some people have found some dirt on Kerry. He has some direct connections with Moveon.org, which is placing smear ads on Bush and others (which it has been doing for over a year). However, John Kerry comes out with an ad saying Bush has ties to the Swift Boat Vets, which has been proven that there is no \"collaboration\" with them. Does Bush need to come out with an ad showing Kerry's ties and collaboration with Moveon.org?\n \n \n Connections\n \n \n 1) From Democrats.org, a Web site of the Democratic National Committee, May 9, 2003:\n \n \"The Democratic Party is partnering with MoveOn.org, People for the American Way, Campaign for America's Future, and dozens of other groups representing millions of Americans to organize a massive public mobilization. On Wednesday, May 14, join us by calling and emailing your representatives in Congress to let them know that the majority of Americans oppose more irresponsible tax cuts that go overwhelmingly to the wealthiest sliver of Americans.\"\n \n \n (http://www.democrats.org/wvc/weekinreview/200305120002.html)\n \n \n 2) From the same Web site's unironically named \"Kicking ***: Daily Dispatches from the DNC,\" here's the ultimate in hypocrisy last Nov. 13 from one of Vermont's more extreme ideologues:\n \n \"Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, took a short break from the 30-hour Republican hypocrisy-a-thon to come and see the results of the DNC's petition drive. We collected more than 310,000 signatures and comments from Americans who stand with Senate Democrats in the fight to keep ultraconservative ideologues off the federal bench.\"\n \n An accompanying photo has this caption: \"DNC Chief Operating Officer Josh Wachs (left), Senator Leahy, and Zack Exley from Moveon.org pose with the more than 310,000 signatures.\"\n \n \n (http://www.democrats.org/blog/display/00010183.html)\n \n \n 3) In its push to obstruct judges who follow the U.S. Constitution, DNC admitted elsewhere on its site that same day, \"The DNC is also conducting a major petition drive in partnership with MoveOn.org. More than 310,000 Americans have signed the petition to protect our courts - with more than 172,000 of those signatures coming in the past 36 hours.\"\n \n \n (http://www.democrats.org/news/200311140002.html) \n \n \n 4) A posting on \"the official Kerry-Edwards blog\" last Dec. 11 includes this boast from one Fe Bongolan of Berkeley, Calif.:\n \n \"The East Bay for Kerry/MoveOn House party on December 7th combined the forces of two grass-roots organizations based in San Francisco East Bay Area. We had 200 guests eating, drinking, and watching the MoveOn Documentary 'Uncovered' featuring Joseph Wilson and Rand Beers from the Kerry campaign.\n \n \"When Teresa Heinz-Kerry arrived, she handed me a pin that read in the center: 'Asses of Evil' with 'Bush', 'Cheney', 'Rumsfeld' and 'Ashcroft' surrounding it. She met, greeted and talked to a jam-packed room of Kerry supporters and others who came for the MoveOn documentary. ...\n \n \"Thanks to Teresa, we kept the party going on, and she helped us here at East Bay for Kerry, throw the Mother of All House Parties.\"\n \n (http://blog.johnkerry.com/blog/archives/000871.html) \n \n \n (http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/8/23/153719.shtml)\n \n \n \n \n What does Kerry have to say about that? Or will he refuse to answer any questions, much like he has done with his war record?",

Working with the group in those activities while pushing for the change in tv ads is fine.\n\n \n \n I don't think he has denounced the Moveon.org ads, but even if he has, his party still supports them. Bush's campaign does not support SBVFT and they have publicly stated that. In responce, the SBVFT said they won't pull their ads no matter what Bush says. That just shows that they are doing this for reasons other than electing Bush. They just don't feel that Kerry is \"fit for command\". Moveon.org has smeared tons of Republicans, so I doubt they have any respectable nature to what they do. They have smeared Bush for 4 years along with Cheney, Rumsfeld, FOX News, all of the Swift Boat vets, etc. \n \n \n \nThe Swift boat ads are from a group just formed to attack Kerry, with strong political connections to the Bush Campaign. The Swift boat group has no other political activities other then the attacks on Kerry. Bush has not denounced this particular ad, has he. I know he has denounced all 527 ads, which is not the same.\n\n \n \n The reason they just formed is because Kerry was just nominated to run for President. Why would they come out with an ad against him running for Senator, especially when many (maybe even all) of them don't live in Massachusetts? Now that he is running for the most responsible position in the country that requires leadership and integrity, they have come out to contest his abilities. The reason they only attack Kerry is because they were all there to witness what he did. They know first hand what he did and what he didn't do. And don't give me that BS that Bush hasn't denounced the Swift Boat ads. Here is a quote for you from Monday, August 23rd at Bush's ranch (the question was asked by a Bloomberg reporter)...\n \n Q That's okay. Some Republicans such as Bob Dole and some Republican donors such as Bob Perry have contributed and endorsed the message of these 527 Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ads -- \n \n THE PRESIDENT: Right. \n \n Q Do you -- when you say that you want to stop all -- \n \n THE PRESIDENT: All of them. \n \n Q Does that mean -- \n \n THE PRESIDENT: That means that ad, every other ad. \n \n Q Would you encourage Republicans not to give to -- \n \n THE PRESIDENT: Absolutely. I don't think we ought to have 527s. I can't be more plain about it. And I wish -- I hope my opponent joins me in saying, condemning these activities of the 527s. It's the -- I think they're bad for the system. That's why I signed the bill, McCain-Feingold. I've been disappointed that for the first six months of this year, 527s were just pouring tons of money, billionaires writing checks. And I spoke out against them early. I tried to get others to speak out against them, as well. And I just don't -- I think they're bad for the system. \n \n \n I think that clearly shows him denouncing that specific ad. And how come Kerry calls for him to denounce this specific ad, but Kerry doesn't denounce the MoveOn.org ad that equated Bush with Hitler, or America's Coming Together, or any of Michael Moore's movies, which flat out lie about Bush?",

How in the hell did you assume that? The only link to Republicans is that a donor from Texas, Bob Perry, gave them some money. How does that produce a link to the Bush family? What about George Soros and his ties to the Democrats? He has dished out 12 million dollars to MoveOn.org. Double standard, or hypocrite? Or both?\n \n \n \n \n \nAgain you aren't comprehending the point. Kerry's complaint isn't that their coming forward, it's that they aren't telling the truth.

What exactly have you found on Moveon.org that has been stated untruthfully??\n\n \n \n But they have told some truths, and proved Kerry wrong in the process. Cambodia, his medals, the atrocities that he says occurred, etc. So, they are in fact telling the truth in some instances, whether you believe it or not. And when Bush denounces the ads, which everyone and their mother was asking him to do, you claim he \"just sits back and watches the damage\". What do you want him to do? He did exactly what Kerry and all of his cronies asked him to do, denounce the ad!! He can't do anything else because the group is not breaking any laws. Now I will show you what I have found on MoveOn.org to be untrue...\n \n \n 1) The came out with an ad that equated Bush with Hitler.\n \n 2) They came out with an ad attacking George Bush's war record (why didn't Bush cry like a little wussy like Kerry did?).\n \n 3) They smear FOX and claim that they called the election for Bush (when in reality they were the first to call it for Gore)\n \n 4) They claim the Bush administration is \"undermining democracy\"\n \n 5) They have DIRECT ties to the Kerry campaign and the Democratic party\n \n \n Some other things (mostly lies) that need to be denounced\n \n 1) A book titled \"Checkpoint\" was just released. Checkpoint, features two characters who spend much of the 115 pages discussing how to assassinate President Bush. The book is replete with deep seeded anger and elegantly nasty epithets hurled at both the president and his cabinet. The publisher is Knopf, the same publisher of Bill Clinton's autobiography. Apparently the book has been structured so that the Secret Service can't do anything to these guys. It's not actually an attempt, and they don't follow through on it. One guy speculates that it's time to kill Bush. It's just over the top and it's time to kill Bush. The prison abuse is one of the reasons why Bush has to be killed, the whole war in Iraq is another. HOW CAN YOU NOT DENOUNCE THAT?\n \n 2) Ted Kennedy called Bush a thug and accused him of concocting a war in Texas (lie).\n \n 3) Howard Dean called Bush a liar and says Bush knew about 9/11 before it happened (this has been repudiated by the 9/11 Commission).\n \n 4) Sen. Harkin calls Cheney a coward.\n \n \n \nThe only thing you knew when you started this thread was you'd get the same responses from the same people that have replied to your other 2,000 threads attempting to criticize Kerry, Democrats, Liberals, and anyone else that doesn't share your very narrow views. Why don't you enlighten all of us that haven't been paying attention for the last 4 years and tell us all the issues Bush is campaigning on.\n\n \n 5) All of Michael Moore's propaganda (who was given the seat of honor in the President's booth at the DNC. Why doesn't Bush give John O'Neill the seat at the RNC?)",
