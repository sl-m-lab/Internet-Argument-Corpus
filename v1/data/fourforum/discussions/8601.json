Do you mean reckless or how offten/far one drives?\n I usually go nearly 3,000 miles before an oil change. When I went to a faily local community college, that was about every 4 1/2 months. When I started driving from Shawnee, KS to Lawrence, KS for classes at KU every day, that 3,000 miles came about 1 3/4 months.",

   "I let mine run to 4k two changes ago ,and really did not feel comfortable with the look of the old oil I removed. A quality oil never really wears out, it justs gets dirty , and the viscosity of the oil if working right, doesnt really change until the engine temps change. I change my own oil /filter/lube because I have had some might I say, \"crappy\" experiences with the quickie oil change centers...\n \n When my oil gets \"sooty\" looking I am ready to change it . With my many \"stop and go \" city miles driven, that happens to be at around 3K. Filters are more efficient the dirtier they get, but when does a too dirty of a filter get too effiecent and allows the oil flow/presssure to suffer ? My truck has the proverbial idiot oil light to warn of low oil pressure, and those things come on at around 7 psi. hmmm....\n \n \n The engine oil has to flow in thru some mighty close tolerances on rod /cam bearing journals/cylinder walls to protect the metal to metal parts from high friction =heat = metal loss. To me, the dirtier the oil the more that protection is lost. ..\n \n \n Yep, this debate could go on forever with everyones opinions being different, kind of like what brand name oil is best out here. ( Get a bunch of gearheads together and start that debate and see what happens :) . All done and said though, Bill is right about the 5K being a good average on change intervals... \n \n Then again I have been proven wrong on the above statement too....\n \n My dear departed brother in law had a 77 Ford F150 2w with the 302 in it. He sold it when it had over 125K miles on it and he never changed the oil , just the filter and it was smokeless and purring good when he sold it. His logic was, that if he changed the oil ever 3K over the time of him owning it, he would just save that money by not spending it on new oil and that he would just put that money it to buying another engine. I argued that logic of his for years but, hmmm :)",

Mobil 1 in everything.\n\n \n Almost 30 years ago, I used to run an oxidation/corrosion test on oils and hydraulic fluid. Air was bubbled through the fluid which had Cu, Zn, Fe, Cd and Al coupons in it. After 1 week at 250F, with air being bubbled continuously through the oil, most oils and hydraulic fluids blacked, increased in viscosity and acidity and began attacking the corrosion coupons. Mobil 1 came out of the test almost exactly as it went in. No viscosity change, no corrosion, no acidity increase. I've use only synthetics since that day for every vehicle that I've owned and some of those that I leased. emoticon_xgood",

   "I change oil every 5000 miles if I remember. 6000-7000 if I don't\n \n My father used to be the fire chief of a fairly sized town. They had enough vehicles in their fleet, and enough miles being put on, to make some oil analysis cost effective. They chose 10 vehicles from the fleet and sent in the oil for analysis every 1000 miles. Most of them needed an oil change at about 8500 miles. 2 of them made it to 10,000 miles. These were not vehicles that were used particularly lightly.\n \n Back in the old days when we used non multi weight, non detergent oils, 3000 miles was a good interval. Those days are gone.\n \n When your oil gets dark, it means nothing. That is the result of minute particles fo soot in the oil. Back in the old days, those particles woudl not be suspended in the oil. Rather they would end up as that nasty sludge that you have to scrape off when you rebuild old engines. In those days, when your oil was dark, you had certainly waited too long. Today, dark oil just means that the oil is doing its job breaking down soot and transporting it as opposed to letting it sludge up your engine. \n \n Strangely enough, there is a whole page about nothign but changing your oil at http://www.nordicgroup.us/oil.htm#The%203000%20Mile%20Myth that has some interesting tidbits (I was searching for why jiffy lubs sucks when I found it).",

   "Good link Daewoo. Referring to my negative comment on \"quickie lubes\" I will name a few things here that happened to me when I let QL's service my vehicles. I will not name company names , because they are not here to defend themselves....\n \n Different times but these things happened to me a QL's..\n \n Cross threaded my oil pan drain nut and ruined the threads in it, so I had to install a oversize self tapping one.\n \n \n \n Knocked the vac lines off of my engine and didnt bother to replace them. Discovered that one after my engine idled roughly on the way home from a QL..\n \n I asked for a total lubrication on the differential/ suspension, especially the front end. This particular compact truck I had at time, had grease fittings located on the tie rods ends, ball joints etc, that were very hard to get to , because of the 4 wheel drive unit on the front of the truck. I stood outside the front of the garage and watched as this young man changed the oil/ filter/differential lubes under the truck while working in a stand up pit. I NEVER witnessed a grease gun getting close to the front end of the truck while I watched him. ..\n \n When the cash register/clerk girl came to get me to sign off on the quickie lube invoice, I asked her had the tech lubed the front suspension of my truck. She turned and loudly asked the tech in the pit \" Did you grease the front suspension on this truck ???\". His reply was . \" 10-4 BAY one !! I sure did !! I got the truck home and checked it out and found all the grease zerks on the front suspension/steering components still had dirt on them , not fresh grease...\n \n \n I always asked for Valvoline 5w30 for my little truck. I had always changed my own oil for the past 20 years on different vehicles I had owned, but getting older now, I thought it would be easier to let a QL do it for me. So, I KNOW what new Valvoline 5w30 should look like when it is just put in the engine. CLEAN and honey colored..\n \n I watched as this one QL tech pumped my requested Valv 5w30 out of the valvoline 5w30 labeled bulk barrel in to my engine. When I got home (2 mile drive) I thought I had better check the oil level and be sure this kid got it right. So ,I pulled the dipstick out and was amazed at what I was looking at on it. This new oil the QL tech had put in was a brownish/black , as discolored as some of the old oil I have taken out of my lawnmower after 3 years. So, I am done with QL's. My vehicle today cost me way TOO much money for me to trust it to QL workers . So , I do my own now once again. jmo",

More important was to have the STP sticker in your rear window.\n\n \n LOL. I will tell you a secret that my brother told me. He worked in an oil changeplace the summer after his senior year in high school and while he was attending the Ford Asset program (until he was able to go to work for a dealer). The place that he worked he said was pretty good.\n \n Anyway, heres the secret. When you go to those places htta have the bulk tanks of oil (NOT the drums, the bulk tanks), usually all the oil in the tanks is the same, and it is all the high grade stuff, so when they offer to sell you regualr 5w40 for regualr price or the super awesome extra cool 5w40 for $30 more, it is the SAME OIL. This is because it is cheaper to buy the high grade stuff for all the bulk tanks than it is to actually buy regular 5w40 and the super 5w40 because of the volume discount. \n \n The first time he ever saw the tanks filled, he watched the guy put the same oil in all the tanks. My brother was at the shop along and refused to sign the delivery form. He made the drvier wait for an hour until the shop manager came in.",
