Maybe it's an american thing?\n\n I think Rosie's approach was more of one who didn't see how they could be justified in thinking it was racist in the first place, so why entertain the \"P.C.\" crowd.\n Football team names are a good example. How many times have we heard of groups complaining that they don't like this name or that name, because offense is taken? And then people point out that the \"Fighting Irish\" aren't up in arms and complaining that their name is being used to imply Irish like to fight.\n \n There are sometimes a small group of people who like to take offense to the slightest thing. Like people who don't like \"gay dummies\" in the windows at Macy's, or when gay people buy tickets and attend a white house event wearing matching accessories.\n \n I think Rosie's initial response probably thought it was just part of that crowd, and the \"offense\" taken was a knee-jerk reaction.\n Take Jyoshu for example. He evidently couldn't even explain why the offense was taken, but he's all ready to attack Rosie with both barrels for being \"insensitive\"...\n \n I think your one sentence sums it up: \"He said I had good points but apparently there are people who are offended so it's best to be careful.\"\n \n There's another phrase: \"If you're out to please everyone, you are going to please noone.\" \n That doesn't mean you should offend people and ignore the offense, but rather that offending some people is going to be inevitable, and that you're just going to have to learn which offenses you are going to apologize for and which need no apology.\n \n I find it interesting that some of your Asian acquaintences \"didn't care\". Evidently it's not a unilateral offensive terminology.\n Your other Asian friend was evidently hypothesizing on why offense was taken.\n Quite frankly, if the situations were reversed and somebody tried telling me that an Asian issue would pop up in an American headline with \"Howdy, howdy, howdy, Charlie Yeung, howdy, howdy, howdy...\"\n I would laugh.\n \n If anything, this just shows Rosie doesn't know how to speak Chinese. If anybody thinks that she thought she did or that she was trying to give an accurate portrayal of Chinese speech: emoticon_xdonno \n She's a comedian for Pete's sake!",

   "Ok, research done.\n \n My 3 asian roommates had not seen or heard of the incident so they didn't have any comment. One said she didn't really care. \n \n One of my asian friends said he thought asians didn't like it because that's not how they actually speak. I asked how she should have imitated an asian language if she doesn't actually speak one. Also, if it had been french for example, and she said random french words like \"parlez-vous, bonjour, vraiment\" etc with exaggerated rolled r's, I doubt that would be considered racism against white people. It's just picking a distinctive sound out of the language. He said I had good points but apparently there are people who are offended so it's best to be careful. Maybe it's an american thing?\n \n Anyway, I tend to believe that she didn't know people would think it was racist. It is completely different from what mel gibson or michael richards said IMO.\n\n \n I too have talked to several asian friends (one is my dormmate) and none of them found it offensive or anything. Most didn't really care about it, one friend found it funny, and my roomate thought that all this is, is some people trying to get some publicity by complaining about something stupid about something a celebrity did.",

Yet I think most non-Muslims see that as overkill, and don't respect the \"offense\". Yet it is universal to Muslims.\n \n In this discussion, a few points have been primarily ignored.\n 1) Is the offense by some Asians an issue of \"overkill\", taking offense where none is present or warranted?\n 2) HOW MANY Asians are actually taking \"offense\" over this?\n There are SOME indians who take offense to native american representation in football names. Some don't care.\n 3) Is this an issue where a vocal few Asians have commented, and it's being swept up by the rally of a few who want to criticize gays at every chance they get?\n \n These are legitimate questions, whether you want to address them or not.",
