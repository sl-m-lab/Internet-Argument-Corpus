   "\"As a life-long politician, Tom Daschle never earned much money. But he retired from the Senate, after being defeated for re-election by John Thune, as a multimillionaire. He retired to Georgetown, of course, not to South Dakota. This happens a lot in Washington, and Daschle's case is pretty typical.\n \n His wife Linda is or was a lobbyist, and she was the one who reported the family's income. (This is inference, since Daschle consistently chose not to make his tax returns public.) Linda Daschle made millions \"lobbying\" on behalf of various corporate interests. There was no conflict of interest, the Democrats assured us, because Linda Daschle only \"lobbied\" the House of Representatives, not the Senate, where her husband was either the Majority or the Minority Leader for much of his career. \n \n But wait! If a company hired Linda to lobby House members, the check they wrote went straight into the Senate Majority Leader's joint checking account. It would have been a felony to write the check to Tom in exchange for political services, but a check to Linda, that went into the same bank account? No problem! She wasn't lobbying the Senate! So Tom Daschle became a multimillionaire.\n \n Another thing that happens a lot in Washington is that when Democrats get appointed to visible, high-ranking positions in the Executive Branch, they suddenly discover that they owe a lot more money in taxes. We saw that with Tim Geithner. The latest example is Daschle, Barack Obama's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services:\n \n Former Sen. Tom Daschle, picked by President Barack Obama to lead the administration's health reform efforts, recently filed amended tax returns to report $128,203 in unpaid taxes and $11,964 in interest, according to a Senate document obtained by The Associated Press.\n \n The White House acknowledged Friday that \"some tax issues\" had emerged in connection with the nomination, but a spokesman said the president is confident the former Senate Democratic leader will be confirmed as the new health secretary.\n \n Daschle filed amended tax returns for 2005, 2006 and 2007 to reflect additional income for consulting work, the use of a car service and reductions in charitable contribution deductions. He filed the returns after the announcement that Obama intended to nominate him to head the Health and Human Services Department.\n \n The principal issues that Daschle is now rectifying with the IRS stem from his relationship with InterMedia Advisors of Englewood, Colo. Daschle is a limited partner and chairman of that firm's executive advisory board, and is also an independent consultant to InterMedia Advisors LLP of New York City.\n \n InterMedia Advisors was founded by Leo Hindery, who, as we noted here, was once the CEO of Global Crossing, a company that enriched a number of prominent Democrats, including Terry McAuliffe, but also turned into one of the biggest bankruptcies in the history of American business, in which creditors and innocent investors lost many millions of dollars. Hindery subsequently ran for Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, served on the Board of Advisors of left-wing Democracy Radio, and was awarded the \"Oates-Shrum Leadership Award of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund.\" In his spare time, he's been funneling cash to Daschle.\n \n Is Tom Daschle a crook, or is it fairer to think of him as a low-level tool of various big-time crooks who play the Washington game by the corrupt rules of the Democratic Party? Either way, it is hard to think of a worse person to put in charge of \"reforming\" the nation's health care system.\n \n Still, there is always a silver lining. One good thing about electing a Democrat as President is that, as he nominates fellow Democrats to senior positions in the Executive Branch, millions of dollars in unpaid tax liabilities come to light and are belatedly paid to the IRS, with interest. It is, perhaps, the most tangible advantage of electing Democrats to office.\"",

   "Simone's fav Michelle Malkin \n \n Howard Dean and Nancy Pelosi can stop clucking now. For the last three years, Democratic leaders cheered GOP ethics woes. Dean accused Republicans of making \"their culture of corruption the norm.\" Pelosi touted cleanliness as a liberal virtue. But with the eye-popping pay-for-play and bribery case against Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich topping a year of nationwide Democratic scandals, the corruption chickens are coming home to roost. \n \n U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald called the breadth and depth of charges against Blagojevich and his Democratic Chief of Staff John Harris \"staggering.\" That's an understatement. Anything that breathed was a potential shakedown target. It's the Chicago way. Democrat Blago's so dirty he'd hit up a children's hospital for money. Oh, wait. He's accused of doing that, too. \n \n Democrat Blago allegedly conspired to use his power to appoint President-elect Barack Obama's vacant Senate seat as a bargaining chip for financial payment. He explored trading on that authority for an appointment as Health and Human Services secretary or as an ambassador or for installment in a cushy union position. (He discussed his trading scheme with an unnamed \"SEIU (Service Employees International Union) official\" and unnamed \"various consultants\" in Washington.) \n \n According to the criminal complaint released yesterday, he also tried to leverage his influence over the sale of Wrigley Field (owned by Tribune media company) in an attempt to get Chicago Tribune editorial writers who called for his impeachment fired -- which illustrates the very perils of media/government entanglements I warned about in my newspaper bailout column last week. His wife, Patricia Blagojevich, was apparently in on the thuggery, too. Taking a break from her first lady duties advocating \"on behalf of women and children,\" she is heard in taped discussions about the Chicago Tribune/Wrigley Field deal telling a governor's aide \"to hold up that f**king Cubs sh*t. ... F**k them.\" \n \n Pelosi, champion of women as political cleaner-uppers, was unavailable for comment. \n \n Fitzgerald says President-elect Obama was not implicated in the plethora of charges against Democrats Blago and Harris. The national media went out of their way to absolve him, too. But declaring Team Obama's hands clean -- especially with Blago crony and indicted Obama donor Tony Rezko in the middle of it all -- is premature. (And if you're wondering why I keep putting \"Democrat\" in front of the accused corruptocrats, it's because the mainstream newspapers can't seem to remember to identify their party prominently the way they do when Republicans are nabbed.) \n \n Chicago's Fox affiliate reports that Obama Chief of Staff and Chicago hometown heavy Rahm Emanuel was the catalyst for the Blago takedown and suggests Rahm-bo tipped off the feds. If so, this raises more questions than it answers about who on the transition team may have talked to Blago and his shakedown artists about what and when. Needless to say, if it were the Republican Bush administration tied to the Blago bust, the White House press corps would be frothing like a pack of Michael Vick's pit bulls. \n \n Democrats and the media can no longer rest on the old rationalization that Blago is an exception to the \"we're cleaner than thou\" rule. 2008 was the year of Democratic Reps. William \"Cold Cash\" Jefferson, Charlie \"Sweetheart Deals\" Rangel, and former Detroit Mayor Kwame \"Text Me\" Kilpatrick. It was the year Democratic Massachusetts State Senator Dianne Wilkerson got caught stuffing bribes from an FBI informant down her shirt. It was the year 12 Democratic leaders and staffers in Pennsylvania's state Capitol were stung in a massive corruption scandal involving cash, sex and abuse of public office. And it was the year of multimillion-dollar embezzlement scandals at Democratic satellite offices of ACORN and the SEIU. \n \n The Democrats have met the culture of corruption, and it looks like it ain't just elephants among the jackasses soiling public office.",

   "Turning up heat on Democrat culture of corruption\n \n The Democrats bloodied Republicans with the \"culture of corruption\" cudgel.\n \n Republicans are finally performing some political jujitsu.\n \n Keep repeating it and don't give them a pass:\n \n Action Demanded on Rangel/Geithner Tax Violations\n \n (WASHINGTON, DC) - While Democrats continue their plan for a federal takeover of the nation's healthcare industry, new revelations show they are incapable of effectively managing even their own members in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n \n House Republican Conference Secretary John Carter (TX-31) and other GOP Members on Tuesday night demanded that the House take ethics action against the obvious double-standard IRS treatment of House Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel (D-NY) and U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner.\n \n Carter was joined on the House floor tonight by fellow U.S. Representatives Phil Gingrey (R-GA), Virginia Foxx (R-NC), Lynn Westmoreland, M.D. (R-GA), and Louie Gohmert (R-TX), and Michael Burgess, M.D.(R-TX) in calling for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to take action to enforce House rules and the law. \n \n New reports in August revealed Rangel's previous tax evasion problems now under investigation by the Ethics Committee are just the tip of long-standing failures to report income to the IRS or under House disclosure rules, prompting calls for his resignation.\n \n \"The rule of law does and should prevail in this nation,\" Carter said. \"It's the glue that holds this society together. And when we see people causing the glue to weaken, I think it's our responsibility to step up and say, 'This has to stop.' We as a Congress should hold each other to those rules.\"\n \n Rangel recently reported hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed assets, including a checking account worth up to half-a-million dollars, stock in PepsiCo and mutual fund investments. Carter is calling for the Ethics Committee to step up and take action.\n \n \"We need to get behind the business of policing up this House,\" he said. \"The Ethics Committee should not be deadlocked along political lines but should resolve this issue. The American people are more and more distrusting of this Congress for reasons like this.\"\n \n Geithner testified in January that he failed to pay nearly $50,000 in taxes he blamed on a Turbo Tax glitch. Rangel and Geithner's failure to pay taxes and a lack of penalty is an example of American citizens using their power to side step the law.\n \n \"People in power are getting special treatment over ordinary folks,\" Carter said. \"Ordinary people and people who have positions of influence should pay similar penalties. There should be no exceptions for the prince nor for the pauper.\"",

   "New Mexico's Democratic Party is besieged by corruption cases, throwing the state's political future into disarray.\n The party has suffered arrests and convictions of two state treasurers and the former Senate president pro tempore, and indictments of a director of affordable housing and a father-son team of public utility commissioners.\n Gov. Bill Richardson remains under federal investigation for a pay-to-play scheme in which he allegedly steered state contracts to various financial firms in exchange for political contributions.\n Meanwhile, after failed presidential and Cabinet bids, and just as he begins to ease back into statesmanship by entertaining two North Korean diplomats at the Santa Fe governor's mansion, one of Richardson's longtime political cohorts is charged with money laundering.\n Former New Mexico Secretary of State Rebecca Vigil-Giron was indicted on charges relating to millions of federal dollars her office spent on 43,000 voter-education commercials. The 54-year-old served three terms as secretary of state (elected the first time at age 31), ran twice for Congress, and intended to run for lieutenant governor in 2010.\n Her prospects have taken a turn for the worse. She was appointed by Richardson in 2007 to head the New Mexico Film Museum at an annual salary of $85,000, but the governor put her appointment on hold after complaints she lacked film industry experience and an audit revealed a $3 million budget shortfall in her office.\n Although Vigil-Giron's attorney told the Albuquerque Journal, \"Rebecca never took a dime of public money,\" she is facing 50 charges of fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, creating false documents and soliciting kickbacks. In addition, the indictment charges Vigil-Giron with depositing millions of dollars into the personal bank accounts of two lobbyists for the city of Albuquerque and a Texas media consultant with Democratic National Committee credentials who worked on Richardson's gubernatorial campaign.\n Awkwardly, the Democratic attorney general is steering the state corruption probe, while another Democrat, Lt. Gov. Diane Denish, is leading the call for an independent state ethics commission. Denish, whose plans to ascend to the governor's office were dashed when Richardson withdrew his nomination for U.S. Commerce secretary (amid revelations of the pay-to-play probe), must take a strong anti-corruption stance if she hopes to win next year's gubernatorial primary. With that in mind, she is lobbying for the newly created commission to have subpoena power and investigative authority.\n New Mexico Democratic Party Plagued by Corruption Cases -- Politics Daily",

   "The Washington Times asks, \"If you knew what Sen. Durbin knew, would you do what he did?\"Why do they ask? because it appears that Senator Durbin may have been involved in some insider trading.\n \n Sen. Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat and assistant majority leader, looked like such a great investor. On Sept. 19, he sold off $42,696 in mutual-fund shares, and quickly sold off another $73,000 during the rest of September. The stock market collapsed after that. Within two weeks, by Oct. 3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen by 9 percent. A month later, by Oct. 17, it had plummeted over 22 percent. On Tuesday this week, the average is still down about 25 percent from Sept. 19.\n \n If Mr. Durbin ever leaves his day job as a Democratic politician, he should have a plum position waiting for him as a market timer. On second thought, maybe not. It turns out that on Sept. 18, Mr. Durbin participated in a closed-door meeting with then-Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. The Fed chairman and Treasury secretary briefed Mr. Durbin and other congressional leaders on the financial crisis and efforts to help financially troubled banks.\n \n Mr. Durbin's great sell-off started the day after this privileged briefing.\n \n Mr. Durbin's temptation to profit on inside information is a base human instinct that reminds why insider trading is wrong.

   "Forty years of tax evasion, misdeeds and contempt\n \n Sources say that the Ethics Committee, which has been hampered by staffing issues over the past year, may vote to widen the Rangel probe even further to include an investigation into Rangel's former childhood home - the now dilapidated row house in Harlem.\n \n Among the issues that have recently surfaced about the brick building are Rangel's failure to disclose any rental income for eight years, between 1993 and 2000 - a period during which The Post found tenants were living there.\n \n In 2004, Rangel sold the row house to the First AME Church Bethel for $410,000. But Rangel left open three building code violations for failing to file an annual boiler inspection report. He owes $1,500, according to the city's Department of Buildings.\n \n Earlier this year, Rangel wrote a letter supporting the church's application for low-income housing tax credits in order to renovate an apartment building on the same street, The Post found.\n \n A source close to the Ethics Committee says Rangel's support of tax credits for the church's proposed $9 million renovation amounts to a conflict of interest since the Congressman had a business relationship with the pastor, the Rev. Henry Belin III.\n \n But while Rangel acknowledges that he may have been sloppy in his accounting records, his office has repeatedly refused to answer any specific questions on his real estate transactions.\n \n Early on, in order to get ahead of a scandal, Rangel himself called for the Ethics Committee probe. He initially blamed his wife Alma, who handled the family finances, for the Dominican villa omissions and cited cultural and language barriers in his failure to disclose rental income. Although he hired a forensic accountant to scour 20 years worth of finances, he stopped short of making his tax returns public.\n \n When all else fails, Rangel tends to go back to his favorite target: A media conspiracy.\n \n Once again, Rangel denounced The Post, saying that he was the victim of conspiracy theories concocted by the Congressman's political enemies.\n \n \"The Post's persistent and vicious attacks are an effort to undermine Democratic leaders who are trying to enact health care reform and to undo the damage done to this country by the Bush Administration,\" said Emile Milne, his spokesman.\n \n *\n \n After 19 terms in Congress, won with easy victories in his district, Rangel may believe he is immune to criticism. But the mounting evidence could prove too much.\n \n \"Congressman Rangel's record of unpaid taxes, false financial disclosure reports and hidden assets has been unfolding for more than a year,\" said Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative ethics group that has filed several complaints against Rangel. \"Speaker Pelosi has done nothing to remove him as Chairman from the House committee that writes the tax laws. Apparently, there is one set of laws for powerful Congressmen and another for everyone else.\"\n \n Republicans, watchdog groups and editorial boards have called for Rangel to resign his chairmanship of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee - demands which have intensified in recent weeks.\n \n \"To allow Mr. Rangel to continue to serve as chairman is the same as allowing a confessed bank robber to serve as chairman of the Banking Committee during the trial,\" Republican Congressman John Carter said last week.\n \n Carter said that if Rangel did not resign, he would introduce a resolution to force his removal.\n \n \n The case against Charlie Rangel",

   "WASHINGTON - Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York is increasingly in the spotlight these days and not just because he is in the thick of the health care debate as chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.\n \n Just as the health care fight heads to the floors of the House and Senate, Republicans are intensifying efforts to make Mr. Rangel a symbol of Democratic misconduct and institutional arrogance because of his belated disclosure of personal assets and other financial missteps.\n \n Despite some unease, Democrats say they are willing to stand by Mr. Rangel and will resist efforts to topple him from his chairmanship pending the anxiously awaited outcome of an ethics investigation that Mr. Rangel himself requested last year. \n \n \"My feeling, and I think it is widely shared, is that the process should be allowed to be completed,\" said Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, a longtime Democratic colleague of Mr. Rangel on the Ways and Means Committee.\n \n Other factors are also at work in the decision by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and fellow Democratic leaders to allow Mr. Rangel, the fourth-most-senior member of the House and one of the nation's best-known African-American politicians, to remain in his high-profile post for now.\n \n Plenty of Democrats are uncomfortable with the notion of Mr. Rangel's being replaced in the middle of the health care fight by the lawmaker next in line, Representative Pete Stark, a very liberal Californian with a sharp tongue and an occasionally abrasive manner. Trying to leapfrog Mr. Stark and devise an alternative line of succession could touch off a bitter intramural fight at a highly inconvenient moment.\n \n In addition, the leadership is wary of alienating the 42-member Congressional Black Caucus. Many of those votes will be needed to push through health care legislation.\n \n Some black caucus members were angry when Ms. Pelosi forced former Representative William Jefferson of Louisiana off the Ways and Means Committee before he was formally charged in a corruption case that ultimately landed him in jail. Any move to sideline Mr. Rangel, a founding member of the caucus, before a finding against him could spark serious resentment. \n \n Mr. Rangel also has a reservoir of good will among his colleagues that is helping him fend off the Republicans.\n \n \"I have not heard anyone in the caucus against him,\" said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland. \"Mr. Rangel is a legend, and I think that people believe that the ethics folks will do their job, and all of us are hoping for the best.\"\n \n But Republicans are not making it easy for Democrats.\n \n Representative John Carter, Republican of Texas and a former judge, said he intended to force a vote next week on a resolution requiring Mr. Rangel to step aside from the helm of the Ways and Means Committee at least until the internal investigation is finished. A similar effort by Mr. Carter was tabled on a party line vote in February, and the same result is expected this time.\n \n But Mr. Carter said new revelations in August that Mr. Rangel had not disclosed an additional $500,000 or more in assets required some action on the part of the House, particularly after multiple tax and financial lapses were uncovered in 2008.\n \n \"It all boils down to this, the public perceives - and rightfully so - that Mr. Rangel's indiscretions are being overlooked, and they know that theirs would not have been,\" said Mr. Carter, who said he hoped the resolution would prompt the ethics committee to finish an investigation that many think was taking too long.\n \n Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, also urged action if Mr. Rangel refused to step aside voluntarily. \"It's improper for Chairman Rangel to remain in his position with all of the influence that he has while the serious allegations remain hanging,\" Mr. Boehner said.\n \n Democrats accuse Republicans of trying to score political points. \"This is nothing more than a partisan stunt to distract from the G.O.P.'s lack of ideas to improve America's health care system and help our economy recover,\" Elbert Garcia, a spokesman for Mr. Rangel, said in a statement.\n \n Republicans do see political opportunity with the ethics troubles of Mr. Rangel, as well as investigations into whether senior Democratic members of the Appropriations Committee improperly steered projects to allies and campaign contributors. \n \n They would love to serenade Democrats with the \"culture of corruption\" refrain that Democrats so successfully employed against Republicans in gaining control of the House in 2006. But Republican efforts are being diluted by misconduct in their own ranks, including the case of Senator John Ensign of Nevada, who is drawing renewed scrutiny for his efforts to cover up an affair with the wife of one of his former top aides.\n \n At this point, Democrats say they are not overly concerned. They believe the fact that an ethics review is under way insulates them from suggestions that they are protecting Mr. Rangel. The hard decision for Democrats might come after the ethics findings. The panel could recommend that Mr. Rangel be ousted from his chairmanship. If a censure were recommended and approved by the House, he would automatically lose his chairmanship under Democratic rules.\n \n But if the ethics committee delivers a mild or moderate rebuke, Democrats might have to assess, with an eye to difficult midterm elections, whether they can take the heat of having the tax panel headed by a lawmaker who erred on his own finances and taxes.\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/03/us/politics/03rangel.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper",

   "They say taxes are a patriotic duty. So why did Geithner and Daschle have trouble paying them?\n \n During the presidential campaign, Joe Biden insisted that paying your taxes is a patriotic duty. No, scratch that. He said that supporting a tax hike was the American thing to do. \"It's time to be patriotic,\" he told America's putative tax slackers. When asked whether he might be questioning the patriotism of people who don't want higher taxes, Biden, as is his wont, took things to the next rhetorical level. Forget patriotism, insisted Joe, paying higher taxes is a religious obligation.\n \n The man who gave an average of $369 a year to charity over the previous decade fulfills his religious obligations by cutting a tax check -- a check he's required to cut by law.\n \n Now it's always perilous to take Biden's statements too seriously, but it does seem eminently fair to say that his comments reflect a common, if not universal, attitude among Democrats. Taxes aren't a \"necessary evil\" so much as a joyous affirmation of the possibilities of government and the lifeblood of a more hopeful society. \"Taxes are what you pay to be an American\" -- like \"membership fees,\" says Democratic language guru George Lakoff.\n \n President Obama merely says that taxes are necessary to \"spread the wealth,\" which is better for everybody. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman frames the issue more reasonably: \"Nobody likes paying taxes ... [but] most Americans also care a lot about the things taxes pay for.\" In other words, paying taxes -- and raising taxes in Krugman's view -- is the adult, serious, morally responsible thing to do. Government needs every last penny, and holdouts must be smoked out.\n \n Now, whatever the best articulation of liberal attitudes toward taxation may be, reasonable people can agree that they inject a lot of moralizing, righteousness and finger-wagging into the issue.\n \n As one leading Democrat put it: \"Make no mistake, tax cheaters cheat us all, and the IRS should enforce our laws to the letter.\"\n \n That Democrat was then-Sen. Tom Daschle in 1998. The same Tom Daschle, we've since learned, who failed to pay more than $100,000 in back taxes for perks he received as one of Washington's most relentless influence-peddlers -- that is, until he realized he might receive a job in the Obama administration spending the money most Americans conscientiously send to Washington.\n \n Daschle's hardly alone. The recently confirmed Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, also failed to pay taxes he owed (even though he surely must have known he owed them) until it became politically expedient to pay them. Now he runs the IRS. Take that, suckers.\n \n Meanwhile, Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the supreme tax-writing body in the United States, the House Ways and Means Committee, is under investigation for, among other things, dodging taxes. His excuse for his admitted mistakes is that he was sloppy and ignorant, but not criminal. Geithner and Daschle make similar noises.\n \n But doesn't that miss the point?\n \n When moralizing conservatives get caught, say, cheating on their wives or challenging stall mates to robust Greco-Roman wrestling in airport bathrooms, liberals justifiably howl at the hypocrisy of it all (even though conservative moralizing has no teeth, while the IRS has agents with guns). When liberals fail to pay taxes -- the wellspring of a just society -- it's merely, to borrow an old phrase from Daschle, \"sad and disappointing,\" but ultimately not that big a deal.\n \n When he was still running the Democratic Party, Howard Dean made fighting hypocrisy his top priority. \"Hypocrisy is a value that I think has been embraced by the Republican Party. We get lectured by people all day long about moral values by people who have their own moral shortcomings.\"\n \n Well, I hear a lot of lecturing from Democrats about why I should be ashamed for not liking taxes more because \"the children\" need it. Florida Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson defended the so-called stimulus bill last week by saying it \"shelters the homeless, and heals the sick. It helps us to look forward to a day where we beat our swords into plowshares.\"\n \n By the Democrats' own logic, not wanting to pay for that is selfish, unpatriotic and immoral. But who do they think tax cheats are cheating?\n \n \"I will use whatever position I have in order to root out hypocrisy,\" Dean promised. \"I'm not going to be lectured as a Democrat -- we've got some pretty strong moral values in my party, and maybe we ought to do a better job standing up and fighting for them.\"\n \n Yes, I would like to see that myself. That would be change I could believe in.\n \n Democrats are hypocrites when it comes to paying taxes -- latimes.com",

   "Staff as 'forgetful' as the boss\n WASHINGTON -- Charlie Rangel's \"forgetfulness\" is apparently contagious. \n \n Two of his top aides are among about a dozen highly paid staffers on the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee who have filed a flurry of amendments correcting their financial-disclosure statements since 2002. \n \n Jim Capel, chief of staff for Rangel's personal office, failed to file any such statements for six years. \n \n On the afternoon of July 14, Capel filed five years' worth of delinquent reports. \n \n Capel told The Post yesterday it was a simple oversight. \n \n \"I am sorry for not making these filings in the timely manner as required,\" he said. \"My failure was not done for no other reason than I just forgot to do so.\" \n \n Another serial mis-filer working for Rangel is George Dalley, who is legal counsel in Rangel's personal office. Dalley has amended his statements four times since 2002. \n \n In his 2007 statement, he failed to disclose as much as $150,000 in rental income on two properties in DC. \n \n The House Ethics Committee also discovered that Dalley had failed to report as much as $45,000 in business transactions he made in 2006. \n \n On his 2004 statement, he failed to report as much as $47,000 in income. \n \n Capel and Dalley are among about a dozen top staffers for the Ways and Means Committee, which Rangel chairs, and Rangel's personal office who have filed a combined 24 amendments over the past seven years.\n \n Staff as 'forgetful' as the boss",

   "ALEXANDRIA, VA. - Former Democratic Congressman William Jefferson was found guilty of 11 of 16 corruption charges today by a federal jury. \n The jury of eight women and four men returned a guilty verdict following five days of deliberation.\n \n \n In the 16-count indictment, Jefferson was charged with soliciting bribes and other crimes for a series of schemes in which he helped American businesses broker deals in West African in exchange for payments or financial considerations to companies controlled by members of his family, including his brother Mose, his wife, Andrea, their five daughters and a son-in-law.\n \n Jefferson, 62, who represented the New Orleans-based 2nd Congressional District for nine terms, will now face sentencing by Judge T.S. Ellis III, who earlier meted out stiff sentences for lesser figures in the case. According to the U.S. attorney's office, Jefferson faced 235 years in prison if convicted on all counts, and will still face substantial prison time.\n \n Prosecutors asked that Jefferson be held as a flight risk, but the judge allowed him to remain free pending his sentencing scheduled for Oct. 30. A forfeiture hearing will be held Thursday to decide what assets Jefferson will have to surrender. \n \n The verdict comes four years after the Aug. 3, 2005 raids of Jefferson's homes in New Orleans and Washington, D.C., in which the FBI found $90,000 in cash hidden in the freezer of his D.C. home, money the government said Jefferson was going to deliver as a bribe to Atiku Abubakar, then vice president of Nigeria, to gain his help with a telecommunications deal in Nigeria being pursued by Lori Mody, a Northern Virginia businesswoman. \n The money was the lion's share of $100,000 in FBI cash that the congressman was videotaped receiving packed in a briefcase days earlier in a suburban Virginia parking lot from Mody, who, beginning in March of 2005, had become a cooperating witness for the FBI, secretly taping her conversations with Jefferson.\n \n The jury did not find him guilty on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which was the count linked to the money in the freezer. \n \n While Mody did not testify at the trial, the jury heard segments of her taped conversations with Jefferson along with more than six weeks of testimony from government witnesses, including iGate Inc. CEO Vernon Jackson and Mody financial adviser Brett Pfeffer, both of whom are serving time after pleading guilty to their involvement in the bribe schemes, and hoped to see their sentences reduced in exchange for their testimony against Jefferson.\n \n Jefferson did not testify in his own defense and his formal defense lasted only about two hours. In his closing argument, lead defense attorney Robert Trout presented his client as a man whose dealings had placed him in an ethical \"gray\" area, but who had not broken the law.\n \n Trout's argument was that Jefferson's help on these business deals in Africa were beyond the purview of his \"official acts\" as a member of Congress, and thus did not violate bribery statutes which prohibit receiving things of value in exchange for official acts.\n \n Trout argued that most of the key witness, including Jackson and Pfeffer, and a number of others who testified to avoid prosecution for their own involvement in the various schemes, were telling stories the government wanted to hear to save their own skins.\n \n Of the government case, Trout said, \"It boggles the mind how they constructed their way around the facts to make something that was not a crime seem like a crime. That's power.\"\n \n The prosecution team scoffed at the notion that Jefferson had anyone to blame but himself, portraying Jefferson as a relentless shakedown artist.\n \n \"He never let an opportunity to demand a bribe payment pass him by,\" said assistant U.S. Attorney Rebeca Bellows in her closing argument.\n \n The jury was comprised of six white women, two white men, two black women and two black men.\n \n Jefferson, the first African-American congressman from Louisiana since Reconstruction, was defeated in a storm-delayed general election in December by Anh \"Joseph'' Cao, a little-known Republican attorney who benefited from a very low turnout.\n \n \n William Jefferson verdict: Guilty on 11 of 16 counts | New Orleans Metro Real Time News - - NOLA.com",

   "Ethics allegations against Rep. Alan Mollohan (D-W.Va.) hit the front page of two major newspapers last week, prompting fears among Democrats that the twelve-term lawmaker's reelection bid could be endangered, along with the effectiveness of their party's overall \"culture of corruption\" argument against Republicans in the 2006 midterms. With so much at stake, Democrats were quick to launch an all-out campaign to discredit the charges.\n \n The controversy surrounding Mollohan was sparked by a story in Friday's Wall Street Journal (and a similar story the following day in the New York Times) that revealed that the Justice Department is reviewing a complaint regarding Mollohan's finances. (The Times editorialized on the issue yesterday, calling Mollohan the \"latest example of the sort of shady dealings that have sent Congress plummeting in the public's estimation\"; here's a news article by The Post's Tom Edsall on the matter.)\n \n The National Legal & Policy Center, a conservative-minded watchdog group, filed a 500-page document in late February with the U.S. Attorney's office in the District of Columbia alleging that Mollohan severely underreported his personal finances in past disclosure statements. Ken Boehm, the president of the NLPC, said his group began investigating the personal financial disclosures of all the members of the House Appropriations Committee last May and Mollohan \"stuck out like a sore thumb.\"\n \n At the center of the NLPC complaint is an exponential increase in Mollohan's net worth between 2000 and 2004 that was due in large part to a series of real estate investments. In 2000, Mollohan's personal financial disclosure statement showed him with $565,000 in household assets and $465,000 in debt; four years later his household assets were estimated at between $6.3 million and $24.9 million with debts of between $3.7 million and $16.5 million. (Mollohan has said his worth is much closer to the lower end of those estimates.)\n \n During that same period, Mollohan secured more than $150 million in earmarked appropriations for five nonprofit groups that he helped establish and which are based in his congressional district. One of the groups is headed by a woman with whom Mollohan has invested in real estate in North Carolina.\n \n \"I very much understood that if you don't respond to a negative attack than the negative attack is likely to be successful,\" Mollohan said in an interview earlier this week when asked about his aggressive approach in response to the complaint. He added that he had never heard about the NLPC filing before receiving a call from the Wall Street Journal reporter late last week and still has not seen a copy of the report. (Boehm said much of the report would be available online in the near future.) \n \n Republicans quickly sought to make political hay out of the complaint. On Friday, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Reynolds (N.Y.) called on Mollohan to step down from the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, where he currently serves as the ranking Democrat, until the Justice Department offers further guidance. Reynolds also suggested that the committee's current stalemate over investigating alleged ethics breaches might be the result of Mollohan's unwillingness to have it investigate him. Speaker Dennis Hastert (Ill.) quickly echoed Reynolds's sentiments.\n \n Republicans' motives are not entirely altruistic, of course. For the first time in better than two decades, Republicans are targeting Mollohan in his northeastern West Virginia seat, recruiting state Del. Chris Wakim (R) as a challenger (with the help of the White House). Vice President Dick Cheney will head to the district, which gave President Bush 58 percent of the vote in 2004, for an April 21 fundraiser to benefit Wakim. Picking up this seat would help offset what many political observers predict will be significant gains by Democrats this fall.\n \n Given that backdrop, Mollohan has smartly sought to cast the complaint filed by the NLPC in partisan terms. \"The NLPC has in the past targeted Democrats with charges that later proved to be without merit,\" Mollohan said in a statement released by his campaign. \"Obviously I am in the crosshairs of the National Republican Party and like-minded entities, such as the NLPC.\" \n \n In a letter sent to Reynolds and Hastert, Mollohan wrote that calls for him to resign from the Ethics Committee reveal \"the entirely partisan, political nature of the attack that has been made upon me, and the reason this attack has been made.\" He added: \"The reason is...that I strongly opposed efforts by the Republican leadership that would have seriously undermined the ability of the Ethics Committee to perform its basic function of enforcing House rules and standards.\"\n \n Mollohan's campaign also is circulating a document titled, \"Timeline of Mollohan standing up to Republicans to ensure fairness in the ethics process.\" It details his work to repeal changes -- backed by GOP leaders -- to how the ethics committee would pursue investigations. The ethics committee has been essentially deadlocked for the entirety of the 109th Congress. \n \n The Democrat's campaign is sending around another document detailing the NLPC's past investigations and funding sources, which is titled \"National Legal & Policy Center: Right-Wing Extremist Group.\" According to the Mollohan document, the NLPC has filed complaints against both Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.). Cantwell was admonished by the Federal Election Commission for failing to report loan information but no further action was taken. The complaint against Moran was dismissed by the FEC.\n \n Boehm took issue with the description of his group as a partisan entity. \"We don't view ethics as a partisan issue,\" he said. Boehm said the NLPC has investigated a number of Republican congressman and Bush administration officials, including Darleen Druyun, who served time for her involvement in an a procurement scandal involving the Air Force and Boeing. \"If we were just picking on Democrats we wouldn't have picked on her,\" Boehm said.\n \n Unlike fellow Democratic Rep. William Jefferson (La.), who also finds himself under federal investigation, Mollohan is taking this controversy head on -- a savvy move given the possibility of a serious reelection fight in the fall. Much of Mollohan's fate is out of his hands, however, as it depends heavily on whether the Justice Department decides to move forward with an investigation. We'll be watching closely and will keep Fix readers updated. \n \n The Fix - W.Va.: 12-Term Democrat at Center of Ethics Storm",

   "WASHINGTON, D.C. - A federal appeals court ruled today that Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., violated federal law by turning over an illegally taped telephone call to reporters nearly a decade ago.\n \n In a 2-1 opinion, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that McDermott violated the rights of House Majority Leader John Boehner, who was heard on the 1996 call involving former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n \n The court ordered McDermott to pay Boehner more than $700,000 for leaking the taped conversation. The figure includes $60,000 in damages and more than $600,000 in legal costs.\n \n McDermott leaked a tape of a 1996 cell phone call involving former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to The New York Times and other news organizations.\n \n The call included discussion by Gingrich, R-Ga., and other House GOP leaders about a House ethics committee investigation of Gingrich. Boehner, R-Ohio, was a Gingrich lieutenant at the time and is now House majority leader.\n \n A lawyer for McDermott had argued that his actions were allowed under the First Amendment, and said a ruling against him would have \"a huge chilling effect\" on reporters and newsmakers alike.\n \n Lawyers for 18 news organizations - including ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, The Associated Press, The New York Times and The Washington Post - filed a brief backing McDermott.\n \n But Boehner's lawyers said McDermott's actions were clearly illegal.\n \n By leaking the tape McDermott \"chilled the free speech of others,\" namely Boehner and Gingrich, lawyer Michael Carvin said following a court hearing in November.\n \n A spokesman for McDermott said today the congressman had just received the ruling and was studying it.

   "\"Saul Alinsky died in 1972. He was a Marxist grassroots organizer who spent much of his life organizing rent strikes and protesting conditions of the poor in Chicago in the 1930s. However, unlike Christian socialist and activist for the poor Dorothy Day, Alinsky's real claim to fame was as strategist for anti-establishment '60s radicals and revolutionaries.\n \n Indeed, Alinsky wrote the rule book for '60s radicals like Bill and Hillary Clinton, George Miller and Nancy Pelosi. He considered Hillary Rodham to be one of his better students and asked her to join him in his efforts as an organizer of radical leftist causes. But Hillary had other fish to fry on her climb to national prominence.\n \n Alinsky had a true genius for formulating tactical battle plans for the radical left. He wrote two books outlining his organizational principles and strategies: \"Reveille for Radicals\" (1946) and \"Rules for Radicals\" (1971).\n \n \"Rules for Radicals\" begins with an unusual tribute: \"From all our legends, mythology, and history (and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins - or which is which), the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom - Lucifer.\" \n \n The devil challenged authority and got his own kingdom, and that goes to the heart of what left is really about. That of course is to get power any way you can, including lying, cheating and stealing. The ultimate rule is that the ends justify the means.\n \n Alinsky asserted that he was more concerned with the acquisition of power than anything else: \"My aim here is to suggest how to organize for power: how to get it and how to use it.\" This is not to be done with assistance to the poor, nor even by organizing the poor to demand assistance: \"[E]ven if all the low-income parts of our population were organized ... it would not be powerful enough to get significant, basic, needed changes.\"\n \n Alinsky advises his followers that the poor have no power and that the real target is the middle class: \"Organization for action will now and in the decade ahead center upon America's white middle class. That is where the power is. ... Our rebels have contemptuously rejected the values and the way of life of the middle class. They have stigmatized it as materialistic, decadent, bourgeois, degenerate, imperialistic, war-mongering, brutalized and corrupt. They are right; but we must begin from where we are if we are to build power for change, and the power and the people are in the middle class majority.\"\n \n But that didn't stop Alinsky and his followers from using the middle class for their own purposes. They counted on the guilt and shame of the white middle class to get what they wanted. In order to take over institutions and get power, the middle class had to be convinced that they were somehow lucky winners in \"life's lottery.\"\n \n Alinsky's radicals found a perfect vehicle for their destruction of the American system and more particularly for taking and maintaining power. That instrument was the Democratic Party.\n \n Transition and Transaction\n \n The transition of the old Democratic Party to what exists today should not surprise or confound conservatives. Nor should Alinsky's tactics seem foreign. After all, for nearly 40 years, Republicans and the conservative agenda have been getting hammered by the left through the successful use of Alinsky tactics.\n \n In that cause, radicals and the liberal-left gravitated toward the print and electronic media, toward the university professorate and the law. The left, consciously or unconsciously, adopted Alinsky's rules. The impact changed the nature of the Democratic Party and the direction of the United States. Increasingly, the left is succeeding in changing the nature of the Republican Party as well.\n \n Suffice to say the greatest change has taken place in the relationship between the state and the individual. America is rapidly descending from a representative Constitutional Republic to a collectivist empire controlled by elites of one sort or another.\n \n Alinsky's influence on the modern Democratic Party indicates that the ends do indeed justify the means. As Alinsky states in \"Rules for Radicals\" it was foolish to believe that means are just as important as the ends. He states that \"to believe in the immaculate conception of ends and principles ... the practical revolutionary will understand ... [that] in action, one does not always enjoy the luxury of a decision that is consistent both with one's individual conscience and the good of mankind.\"\n \n Sadly, not enough Republicans and conservatives learned Alinsky's rules until late in the game. A sign of hope is the fact that the new media, including talk radio and the Internet, are changing all that. One can hope it is not too late. \n \n In any event, Alinsky's rules include: \n \n \"Wherever possible go outside the experience of the enemy. Here you want to cause confusion, fear and retreat.\"\n \n \"Make the enemy live up to his/her own book of rules. You can kill them with this. They can no more obey their own rules than the Christian church can live up to Christianity.\"\n \n \"Ridicule is man's most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counterattack ridicule. Also, it infuriates the opposition, who then react to your advantage.\"\n \n \"The threat is generally more terrifying than the thing itself.\"\n \n \"In a fight almost anything goes. It almost reaches the point where you stop to apologize if a chance blow lands above the belt.\"\n \n \"Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it and polarize it.\" (Think Gingrich, Lott and the success of name-calling used by the likes of Bill Clinton, Paul Begala, James Carville, Maxine Waters and others against conservatives and Republicans. Think of how Clinton \"enemies\" like Paula Jones or Linda Tripp were treated.)\n \n \"One of the criteria for picking the target is the target's vulnerability ... the other important point in the choosing of a target is that it must be a personification, not something general and abstract.\" (Trent Lott comes to mind. Meanwhile, a former Klansman by the name of Sen. Robert Byrd got away with saying \"nigger\" on Fox News at least three times, and he still maintains his Senate seat and power.)\n \n \"The enemy properly goaded and guided in his reaction will be your major strength.\" For instance, Democrats imply conservatives are racists or that Republicans want to kill senior citizens by limiting the growth of the Medicare system, they imply Republicans want to deny kids lunch money without offering real proof. These red-herring tactics work. \n Of course, Republicans reaction to all this is to immediately go on the defensive. Seldom do they unleash their pit bull orators or strategists. Rather than use the immense amount of data available to prove the conservative case, Republicans tug their forelocks, say \"yes sir,\" and hope the accusations and name calling will go away.\n Why is it that Republicans consistently fail to point out the monumental failures of the new Democrats? Failures such as the massive disaster that is the \"war on poverty.\" On that topic alone Republicans should be drilling the public in every media venue and at every opportunity. Then and only then should Republicans offer alternatives to the failed policies of the Democratic left.\n \n Republicans should pound relentlessly on the fact that the Democratic Party was hijacked by leftist reactionaries way back in the early '70s. The reactionary left is the obstructionist left. They do nothing but defend and cling to the failures of the past. That fact makes them reactionaries rather than radicals or progressives.\n \n Unfortunately, Republicans still pretend that nothing has changed regarding the basic philosophy of the political parties. They refuse to understand the horrendous notion that Democrats tell us the U.S. Constitution is flexible. That means the rule of law is flexible. If that is the case the law and the Constitution mean nothing. It means that the law and Constitution are twisted by the whims and fancies of the moment.\n \n In fact, in the 2000 election Al Gore maintained the Constitution could and should be manipulated because it was \"flexible.\" Whatever happened to the amendment process?\n \n Bill Clinton used executive orders to circumvent Congress and the Constitution. He used the agencies of the federal government against his enemies. Clinton set an extremely dangerous precedent. Alinsky would have loved it. It is a perfect example of the use of the Rules for Radicals - ends justify the means.\n \n Hillary and Bill Clinton and other powerful former '60s radicals learned from Saul Alinsky. It is about time that a few more Republicans and/or conservatives did as well.\n \n Alinsky in South Dakota\n \n Remember that Alinsky's advice was that the ends justify the means. Think of Florida in 2000 and the manipulation of military ballots. Think of Milwaukee and unattended polling places, which allowed leftist college students to take handfuls of ballots to check off. Think of a million immigrants in the 1996 election granted instant voting rights by the Clinton administration. \n \n More importantly, think of South Dakota in November of 2002, or Nevada in 1998 or 2002.\n \n In a brilliant bit of investigative reporting, National Review's Byron York gave us a grand overview of the corrupt and unpleasant outline of how Alinsky's rules work during election season. Republicans, once again asleep at the switch, live in the land of euphoria. They still believe that their Democratic counterparts are among the angels on God's right.\n \n Considering that Alinsky expresses admiration for Lucifer, they are looking in the wrong place to find many modern Democrats. Republicans still assume that the modern Democratic Party, its media sycophants, its operatives during national or state elections, will play fair. It is hard to say which is worse, Republican na\u00efvet\u00e9' or Democratic cheating and law breaking.\n \n When Democrats cheat, especially under Bill Clinton's and Terry McAuliffe's watch, they whine when they discover they didn't cheat enough to win. When they are caught in the big lies, they expect Republicans to ignore it and give them a pass. The last election in South Dakota is a case in point.\n \n In the primaries and election of 2002, lawyers from Washington started showing up at polling places in the hinterlands of South Dakota. The Republican leadership and the establishment should have seen it coming but they didn't. \n \n As Byron York relates in \"Badlands, Bad Votes\": \"On Election Day, Noma Sazama knew something unusual was going on the moment she arrived at her polling place, the St. Thomas Parish Hall in Mission, South Dakota. Sazama, a member of the local election board, noticed several strangers in the room - an unusual sight in Mission, population 904, where most people know one another. It turned out the strangers were all lawyers, Democrats who had come to town to serve as poll watchers for the race between incumbent Democratic senator Tim Johnson and Republican John Thune. One was from Washington, D.C., another was from New York City, and a third was from California. 'There were no locals, and I've never seen that happen before,' says Sazama, who has lived in the area for 73 years.\"\n \n Furthermore, York maintains, \"The Democratic team of lawyers confiscated the Parish Hall kitchen only a few feet from the balloting tables.\"\n \n Witnesses swore in affidavits that party hacks had rented dozens of vans and hired drivers to bring voters to the polls. Lawyers from elsewhere made the Parish Hall their headquarters. Seventy-three-year-old Ms. Sazama stated, \"They had the names and time-of-pickup and whether someone voted on them, and from those he would contact the drivers.\" \n \n Finally she understood that the influx of outside Democrats were going to use the polling place as their headquarters, an action which is against the laws of South Dakota.\n \n The lawyers tied up the phones, which meant that the poll watchers and election officials could not make needed phone calls. York quotes the election supervisor: \"They were on the phone using it to call I don't know where, and I needed to call because we had some new districting. They were always talking on it.\" \n \n When Wanless, the election supervisor, protested, she got a chilly reaction from the out-of-towners. \"I felt like they were trying to intimidate me,\" she recalls.\n \n In fact, all this is against South Dakota law, which states: \"No person may, in any polling place or within or on any building in which a polling place is located or within one hundred feet from any entrance leading into a polling place, maintain an office or communications center. ...\"\n \n There were no Republican lawyers or authorities around to inform election officials that it was against the law for the Democrats to be running their campaign from a polling place. That was bad enough, but ever since November Republicans have failed dismally to make it a BIG national issue.\n \n There was also complete failure to understand Alinsky's second basic rule: \"Wherever possible go outside the experience of the enemy. Here you want to cause confusion, fear and retreat.\" The DNC counted on the locals being intimidated by a gang of high-priced lawyers - and of course they were.\n \n Another Alinsky rule used in the November elections in South Dakota: \"In a fight almost anything goes. It almost reaches the point where you stop to apologize if a chance blow lands above the belt.\" In other words, what you do is count on the failure of will by your opponent to call a foul. The opponent usually believes it is easier to do nothing, it is always easier to do nothing, and so Republicans \"move on.\" \n \n That is the kind of apathy Hitler's forces counted on in the Weimar Republic. The end-justifies-the-means cabal figures that even good people find it easier to do nothing.\n \n In South Dakota, lawyers from diverse places were part of a brigade that the DNC uses to \"ensure voters' rights are protected.\" But as York relates, \"According to the testimony of dozens of South Dakotans who worked at the polls, the out-of-state attorneys engaged in illegal electioneering, pressured poll workers to accept questionable ballots, and forced polling places in a heavily Democratic area to stay open for an hour past their previously-announced closing time. In addition, the testimony contains evidence of people being allowed to vote with little or no identification, of incorrectly marked ballots being counted as Democratic votes, of absentee ballots being counted without proper signatures, and, most serious of all, of voters who were paid to cast their ballots for Sen. Johnson.\"\n \n According to some witnesses, Democrats were also running car pools out of polling places on the Indian reservations, where investigators are discovering that the dead Indian vote had a major impact on the slim, last- minute, 524-vote Tim Johnson victory over John Thune.\n \n Affidavits from South Dakotans also indicate that money probably changed hands in crucial areas in the boonies. It was not gas money for van drivers either, but paying per head per vote - shades of Tammany Hall and the elections in Boston wards. Nonetheless, Republicans have decided to \"move on.\"\n \n To get the entire story, including affidavits sworn to by South Dakota residents, read York's November article in National Review Online.\n \n Alinsky Does Nevada\n \n When I worked at Nevada Policy Institute in Nevada several years ago, the Post-election analysis of the 1998 election uncovered the fact that family pets received absentee ballots in crucial districts. Dead people were counted as well. \n \n Democratic Senator Harry Reid's slim, 428-vote win against Republican John Ensign raised eyebrows and the juices of some who understand how the modern DNC and its phalanx of wheelers and dealers, lawyers and opportunists really work. \n \n A part of the tactic includes breaking the law when you can and where you can get away with it. Remember, in the minds of the hijacked Democratic Party the ends do indeed justify the Luciferian means.\n \n In Nevada on Dec. 24, 2002, the FBI seized ballots cast in primary and general elections. Said Daron Borst, FBI special agent in Las Vegas, \"There is an ongoing investigation into election fraud, but I can't go into any details due to the nature of the investigation.\" \n \n Ballots were taken after a complaint was lodged that 85 voters in tiny Eureka county did not live in that county or were long dead. The Eureka County probe marked the second time this year the FBI has become involved in a county election in Nevada.\n \n As in South Dakota, it is much easier to get away with election fraud where people don't know the law or will not enforce the law or they are intimidated by the chutzpah and law breaking of crooks in Armani suits holding credentials from the Democratic National Committee.\n \n Unfortunately, when Republicans don't pay attention to the corruption and allow themselves to get screwed time and again, they are also in league with the devil. By this failure of will, the sins of omission are as evil as sins of commission.\n \n Voting fraud was rampant in 2000 and again in 2002 and it will be more so in 2004. Why aren't Republican lawmakers and the RNC making sure this does not happen again? In 2002, Terry McAuliffe told the world that Democratic lawyers would be out in the states keeping an eye on things. They did more than that and it was against the law.\n \n The failure of Republicans to impose the rule of law on the cheaters, liars and manipulators allows those who use Alinsky's corrupt system to win. That fact tells us that the voting process means as little to our elites as does the Constitution. \n \n Because of that fact, Republicans will lose future elections. More importantly, the people of the United States will lose.\n \n The RNC and the GOP leadership just don't get it. Otherwise they would care enough to do something about it.\"\n google baby google, no more source game",

   "Celebrity Justice in a Just Society\n Ken Connor\n \n Lady Marguerite Blessington wrote: \"The vices of the rich and great are mistaken for error; and those of the poor and lowly, for crimes.\" \n \n Cynics say the term \"celebrity justice\" is an oxymoron. They point to the cases of O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson as examples; but most recently they point to Roman Polanski as the reason for their cynicism. However, after 30 years of evading justice, the notorious director--indicted in 1977 for drugging, raping, and sodomizing a 13-year-old girl--may finally be required give an account for his actions. \n In the meantime, Hollywood's cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me (which, ironically, had gathered in Switzerland to present him with a lifetime achievement award) has come to Polanski's defense. This elite group--which apparently finds nothing criminal or perverse about Polanski's behavior--has acted as an apologist for Polanski, and attempted to use its celebrity influence to prevent his extradition to the United States. \n \n This case is a classic example of a gross double standard of justice at work between the average citizen and the rich, powerful, and famous. Polanski's supporters are, in effect, arguing that he should receive a free pass because of his brilliance and talent. Swiss filmmaker Otto Weisser's comment says it all:\n \n \"I am ashamed to be Swiss, that the Swiss is doing such a thing to brilliant fantastic genius, that millions and millions of people love his work.... He's a brilliant guy, and he made a little mistake 32 years ago. What a shame for Switzerland.\" \n \n Never mind that what Roman Polanski did was morally repugnant (not to mention illegal). Never mind the fact that he is a man who has exhibited no qualms about taking advantage of young, impressionable girls. As far as the artistic community is concerned, Polanski's brilliance as a filmmaker trumps his responsibilities as a member of the human race and immunizes him from the need for accountability before the law. Using this same train of logic one can only assume that if Polanski were a mere pedestrian filmmaker, his fellow artists might be less willing to give him a pass. \n \n This same warped mindset has infiltrated other parts of our society--a society increasingly obsessed with the antics and peccadilloes of the rich and famous. Consequently, securing justice in situations involving criminal accusations against giants of the entertainment industry is often difficult. So too in the political arena, where elected officials at every level of government routinely engage in reckless conduct with an arrogance possessed only by those convinced that they are above the law. \n \n Imagine the consequences for the average Joe if he admitted to engaging in sexual relations at the workplace with a variety of female subordinates. He would be fired on the spot. What if he were exposed for tax evasion? Jail time and heavy fines, no doubt. And finally, what if our average Joe were indicted for drugging a 13-year-old girl and performing lewd sex acts upon her semi-conscious body? If convicted, he could count on a stiff jail sentence followed by a conspicuous spot on the national database of sex offenders, no job prospects, and little chance of regaining respectable standing in the community.\n \n For celebrities like David Letterman, Charles Rangel, or Roman Polanski, however, none of these consequences appear to apply. Letterman's primary worry in the aftermath of his on-air confession seems to be with his ratings--which, by the way, have skyrocketed. Charles Rangel continues to preside over the appropriation of our tax dollars as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Roman Polanski receives a lifetime achievement award for excellence in filmmaking.\n \n Exempting the rich and famous from the need to conform to the moral norms and prevailing laws of society makes a mockery of the principle of justice. As history has demonstrated, a just society cannot exist if the rule of law is not applied equally to all. Roman Polanski may be a brilliant filmmaker. His work may be admired the world over. He may be an inspiration to his peers. But none of this vitiates his obligations under the law.\n \n Polanski should be extradited to the United States and made to answer for his actions. As the saying goes, justice delayed is justice denied. Thankfully, after more than three decades of thumbing his nose at the Lady Justice, for Mr. Polanski the chickens are finally coming home to roost.",
