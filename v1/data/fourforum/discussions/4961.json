   "Sen. Edward Kennedy's Abu Ghraib Meltdown  \n By E.F. Winslow\n 4-27-2005 \n \n Yesterday, Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D) released a statement commemorating the first anniversary of the revelations of detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Never missing an opportunity for a partisan attack, he described how the now infamous images of Charles Graner and Lynndie England with their prisoners had been \"seared into our collective memory\" and laid the blame squarely on the shoulders of the Republican administration. \n \"The Administration\" Kennedy says, \"left our soldiers, case officers, and intelligence agents in a fog of ambiguity. They were told to 'take the gloves off' without knowing what the limits were.\" Read Article..http://www.conservativenews.us/articles05/42705_kennedy_and_abu_ghraib.htm",
