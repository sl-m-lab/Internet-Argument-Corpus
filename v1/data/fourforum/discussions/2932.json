However, I think that some people actually believe that if you eliminate the weapons currently used by criminals, there will eventually be no crime. They fail to see that the crime comes from the criminal and not from the tool he chooses.",

   "I agree also. I may have a partial answer to your question. I haven't browsed this forum much, so forgive me if I'm saying something that's already been said.\n \n Whenever you see a commercial, or ad, or anything put out by an organised gun control group, or many news reports concerning guns, take note of one thing they constantly try to do - they try to portray the gun itself as a live thing. It's always between the lines, and very clever, but it's there. Kids are told, \"if you see a gun, don't touch it, run and tell an adult.\" All the trigger locks and other secure gun storage are implied to be absolutely necessary so the GUN can do no harm. News reports are constantly telling us what the GUN did. Defence attorneys use this to coach their clients - \"tell them the gun just went off all by it's OWN SELF!!! \n \n Watch for it - it's a fairly new tactic, but over a long period it will work for them as it becomes a foundation in the minds of today's children - tomorrows adults.",

Marajuana is illegal, people seem to have no trouble getting it. \n \n Why would guns be any different? Admittedly there are some nations with strict gun control laws where they have much lower rates of gun crime than the US. A good example is Japan. There are also nations with incredibly strict penalties for posession of a firearm, such as S Africa, where posession of a firearm can be a capitol offense, yet they have MUCH higher rates of gun crime than the US. \n \n The problem does not seem to be the guns, but those who weild them. From a realistic standpoint, you are talking about a firearm murder rate of .000003% in regards to our population as a whole, so I personally have to wonder if it even IS a problem. From a statistical stanpoint, the data should be zeroed out in the name of keeping the numbers pretty (any statistics professor will generally tell you to zero out a number that small)",

   "Many people have at some point been faced with a situation where another person has threatened us with bodily harm. This varies in gravity from schoolyard bullying all the way up to barrom brawls etc.\n My point is, this happens so very rarely. Have any of you actually had a gun pointed at you? For that matter, have any of you ever been shot?\n I've been alive for over 11,132 days, and I've never been shot. I'd say that I have a pretty good chance of surviving today without being shot, as well as tomorrow.\n \n Sure, guns are the great equalizer. That's not necessarily a bad thing. If a gun could enable a weakling to overcome a strong person in the commission of a crime, it can just as easily enable one to protect themselves against a physically powerful aggressor. Whether or not guns are in the equation, our safety from crime depends on our trust in our fellow man, that he will not wrong us.\n \n Lets look at another fact. I've owned a gun for over 9 years, and have never had to point it at anyone. At the same time, I pay car insurance. I have needed to pull out my insurance card to protect myself against loss couple of times. I would no sooner cancel my insurance than I would give up my gun. Even though my chances of getting in an accident are low, it could happen. \n \n I seriously doubt that the roads would be safer if no one had insurance. I believe the same applies to guns. I wonder how many of these murders were committed while under the influence of drugs or alcohol? I don't think it would be a stretch to blame the intoxicants, rather than the guns. Sure, you could argue that without guns there would be no shooting, but that doesn't stop intoxicated, violent people from having murderous impulses. \n \n Have any of you ever held or fired a gun? They are not all \"designed for killing\". What they are designed for is to accurately propel a projectile. What the owner of the machine we call a gun does with it is entirely Dependant upon them. Cars weren't designed to kill either (in fact they are designed to be as safe as possible), yet they kill many more people each year than guns, and most of the time the drivers aren't trying to murder anyone. Alcohol and drugs are often blamed as the cause for these accidents, and always the driver is held responsible. How can you trust the same people you would disarm to drive? They are much more dangerous behind the wheel. \n Many people argue that guns aren't necessary. I think that cars aren't necessary either. That doesn't mean I'm going to stop driving. In fact, even though I know I stand a much better chance of dying from a car wreck than getting shot, I'm still going to use my car to go to work every day.\n \n I think everyone who is opposed to guns should at the very least spend a little time to get some firsthand knowledge about them. Go to a firing range and rent a small caliber target pistol, something with low recoil. If you aren't familiar with how to use one, you might be surprised to find how helpful and friendly the people at a range can be. In fact, I'll bet that most people who are willing to do this despite their established ideas about guns will come away with a better understanding of why gun owners like them. If you've ever played a game of darts in a bar, you know how fun it can be. Competitive target shooting is just as fun (albeit without alcohol).\n \n The solution to murder is simple. Ban murderers. You can take a gun away from a person with murderous intentions, but they will still have those intentions. In fact, I'd be willing to bet any amount of money that no crime has ever been committed by a law abiding citizen. Why not make some laws that make it harder for criminals, drug users, and alcoholics to get guns, while allowing law abiding citizens to keep them? Guess what, they are already in place.\n \n The reason these laws have not stopped people from committing crimes with guns is simple. All the laws in the world aren't going to stop crime. Crime is going to happen. People will be murdered no matter what tool they use to accomplish it. If it were illegal to turn a screw, and you banned screwdrivers to prevent it, I guarantee there will be people out there using butter knives to get the job done.\n \n Finally, I asked for people to explain why they as individuals feel unsafe around firearms based on personal experience. Forget all the same tired statistics and generalizations. What has led you to believe you stand a good chance of getting shot? How many times have you come close to being shot? How many times have you come close to being injured or killed, and of those times, how many involved guns? Please answer these questions before passing judgement on gun owners.",
