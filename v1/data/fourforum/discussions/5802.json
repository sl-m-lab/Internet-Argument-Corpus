Nets Skipped or Barely Touched Durbin & Clinton, Now Jump on Rove\n When Howard Dean made any number of his outlandish attacks on Republicans, Senator Hillary Clinton described Republicans as \"people who have never been acquainted with the truth\" and Dick Durbin slimed servicemen by equating detainee treatment at Guantanamo with Nazis and the Soviet gulag, the broadcast network evening and morning shows ignored the remarks, or got to them fleetingly months or a week or so later. But when Karl Rove, the White House Deputy Chief-of-Staff, observed that \"liberals saw the savagery of the 9/11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding to our attackers,\" the networks pounced within hours. ABC's World News Tonight, which had never shown the allegations from Clinton or Durbin, jumped on Rove. Anchor Elizabeth Vargas snidely asserted that Rove \"was not attempting to reach across the aisle.\" Jake Tapper relayed how Rove's \"remarks had Democrats up in arms today as they recall the bipartisan resolution to go to war against al-Qaeda.\" Tapper scolded: \"President Bush came to office promising to change the tone in Washington. Political observers say it has changed. It's nastier.\" NBC's Kelly O'Donnell passed along: \"Adding insult, Democrats say after 9/11, both parties stood with the President.\"\n CNN's Aaron Brown chided Rove for his \"silly\" comments. with audio and video\n \n 2. Morning Shows Pounce on Rove, Unlike Handling of Dem Comments\n CBS's Early Show has yet to utter a word about how Senator Dick Durbin's June 14 sliming of servicemen by equating detainee treatment at Guantanamo with Nazis and the Soviet gulag, but on Friday morning CBS highlighted how, as Rene Syler put it, \"presidential advisor Karl Rove stirred up a hornet's nest with a speech about liberals and the war on terror.\" NBC's Today didn't get to Durbin until the morning after his June 21 apology, and then only in a brief item during the 8am news update, but on Friday, Today led with Rove as Matt Lauer trumpeted: \"Good morning, President Bush's right hand man under fire. Did Karl Rove go too far in his comments on liberals and 9/11?\" Today aired a full story from Kelly O'Donnell before Lauer dedicated most of a session, with White House Counselor Dan Bartlett, to Rove. Lauer read how Senator Harry Reid wants Rove to apologize and resign, and then demanded: \"Why won't Karl Rove apologize?\" Over on ABC's Good Morning America, which got to Durbin with a full story only the morning after his apology, Bill Weir pressed Bartlett about Rove with two questions. Weir set them up: \"Top political advisor Karl Rove certainly stirred controversy with some comments attacking liberals this week. Let's listen to this.\"\n \n 3. Washington Post Buried Durbin, But Puts Rove on the Front Page\n Like the networks, the Washington Post showed it's a lot more excited about Karl Rove, putting him on Friday's front page, after burying Dick Durbin in short stories inside.\n \n 4. Hardball Panel Frets GOP Making National Security a \"Wedge Issue\"\n On Thursday's Hardball on MSNBC, during a discussion about Karl Rove's remarks, Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Klaidman charged that \"national security has become a wedge issue for the Republicans in a way that race was in the 1980s.\" He contended the comments were a diversionary tactic: \"They need an enemy, someone that they can demonize as they go forward. And particularly at a time when the President is having problems in terms of his poll numbers and the economy and other issues.\" Fill-in host David Gregory soon scolded the White House for having Vice President Dick Cheney \"say 'let's remember they're all bad people' [at Guantanamo] and when you send such a lightning rod like Karl Rove out to say that the left wanted to subject the 9/11 terrorists to therapy. Doesn't that sort of caricature what are important debates in the country?\"",

This is for anyone, not just VoR.\n\n \n I guess you are the last one in the USA to hear about it my friend but here you go.......This was posted by his home state newspaper...You should learn how to search on google.all id did was type in Durbin and gulag..........\n \n enjoy\n \n http://www.suntimes.com/output/steyn/cst-edt-steyn19.html\n \n Durbin slanders his own country\n \n June 19, 2005\n \n BY MARK STEYN SUN-TIMES COLUMNIST\n \n \n Throughout the last campaign season, senior Democrats had a standard line in their speeches, usually delivered with righteous anger, about how \"nobody has a right to question my patriotism!\" Given that nobody was questioning their patriotism, it seemed an odd thing to harp on about. But, aware of their touchiness on the subject, I hasten to add that in what follows I am not questioning Dick Durbin's patriotism, at least not for the first couple of paragraphs. Instead, I'll begin by questioning his sanity.\n \n Last Tuesday, Senator Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, quoted a report of U.S. \"atrocities\" at Guantanamo and then added:\n \n \"If I read this to you and did not tell you that it was an FBI agent describing what Americans had done to prisoners in their control, you would most certainly believe this must have been done by Nazis, Soviets in their gulags, or some mad regime -- Pol Pot or others -- that had no concern for human beings.\"\n \n Er, well, your average low-wattage senator might. But I wouldn't. The \"atrocities\" he enumerated -- \"Not only was the temperature unbearably hot, but extremely loud rap music was being played in the room\" -- are not characteristic of the Nazis, the Soviets or Pol Pot, and, at the end, the body count in Gitmo was a lot lower. That's to say, it was zero, which would have been counted a poor day's work in Auschwitz or Siberia or the killing fields of Cambodia.\n \n But give Durbin credit. Every third-rate hack on every European newspaper can do the Americans-are-Nazis schtick. Amnesty International has already declared Guantanamo the \"gulag of our times.\" But I do believe the senator is the first to compare the U.S. armed forces with the blood-drenched thugs of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge. Way to go, senator! If you had a dime for every crackpot Web site that takes up your thoughtful historical comparison, you'd be able to retire to the Caribbean and spend the rest of your days torturing yourself with hot weather and loud music, as well as inappropriately provocative women and insufficient choice of hors d'oeuvres and all the other shameful atrocities committed at Guantanamo.\n \n Just for the record, some 15 million to 30 million Soviets died in the gulag; some 6 million Jews died in the Nazi camps; some 2 million Cambodians -- one third of the population -- died in the killing fields. Nobody's died in Gitmo, not even from having Christina Aguilera played to them excessively loudly. The comparison is deranged, and deeply insulting not just to the U.S. military but to the millions of relatives of those dead Russians, Jews and Cambodians, who, unlike Durbin, know what real atrocities are. Had Durbin said, \"Why, these atrocities are so terrible you would almost believe it was an account of the activities of my distinguished colleague Robert C. Byrd's fellow Klansmen,\" that would have been a little closer to the ballpark but still way out.\n \n One measure of a civilized society is that words mean something: \"Soviet\" and \"Nazi\" and \"Pol Pot\" cannot equate to Guantanamo unless you've become utterly unmoored from reality. Spot the odd one out: 1) mass starvation; 2) gas chambers; 3) mountains of skulls; 4) lousy infidel pop music turned up to full volume. One of these is not the same as the others, and Durbin doesn't have the excuse that he's some airhead celeb or an Ivy League professor. He's the second-ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Don't they have an insanity clause?\n \n Now let us turn to the ranking Democrat, the big cheese on the committee, Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Leahy thinks Gitmo needs to be closed down and argues as follows:\n \n \"America was once very rightly viewed as a leader in human rights and the rule of law, but Guantanamo has drained our leadership, our credibility, and the world's good will for America at alarming rates.\"\n \n So, until Guantanamo, America was \"viewed as a leader in human rights\"? Not in 2004, when Abu Ghraib was the atrocity du jour. Not in 2003, when every humanitarian organization on the planet was predicting the deaths of millions of Iraqis from cholera, dysentery and other diseases caused by America's \"war for oil.\" Not in 2002, when the \"human rights\" lobby filled the streets of Vancouver and London and Rome and Sydney to protest the Bushitler's plans to end the benign reign of good King Saddam. Not the weekend before 9/11 when the human rights grandees of the U.N. \"anti-racism\" conference met in South Africa to demand America pay reparations for the Rwandan genocide and to cheer Robert Mugabe to the rafters for calling on Britain and America to \"apologize unreservedly for their crimes against humanity.\" If you close Gitmo tomorrow, the world's anti-Americans will look around and within 48 hours alight on something else for Gulag of the Week.\n \n And this is where it's time to question Durbin's patriotism. As Leahy implicitly acknowledges, Guantanamo is about \"image\" and \"perception\" -- about how others see America. If this one small camp of a few hundred people has \"drained the world's good will,\" whose fault is that?\n \n The senator from Illinois' comparisons are as tired as they're grotesque. They add nothing useful to the debate. But around the planet, folks naturally figure that, if only 100 people out of nearly 300 million get to be senators, the position must be a big deal. Hence, headlines in the Arab world like \"U.S. Senator Stands By Nazi Remark.\" That's al-Jazeera, where the senator from al-Inois is now a big hero -- for slandering his own country, for confirming the lurid propaganda of his country's enemies. Yes, folks, American soldiers are Nazis and American prison camps are gulags: don't take our word for it, Senator Bigshot says so.\n \n This isn't a Republican vs Democrat thing; it's about senior Democrats who are so over-invested in their hatred of a passing administration that they've signed on to the nuttiest slurs of the lunatic fringe. It would be heartening to think that Durbin will himself now be subjected to some serious torture. Not real torture, of course; I don't mean using Pol Pot techniques and playing the Celine Dion Christmas album really loud to him. But he should at least be made a little uncomfortable over what he's done -- in a time of war, make an inflammatory libel against his country's military that has no value whatsoever except to America's enemies. Shame on him, and shame on those fellow senators and Democrats who by their refusal to condemn him endorse his slander.",
