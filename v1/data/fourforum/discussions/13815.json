   "This fine upstanding pillar of the shooter community had a ccw permit. \n\n \n So?\n \n Last time I checked, MASS MURDER was against the law. Didn't care too much for following that one, did he?\n \n This is like pointing out that the man who drove through a retirement community killing 3 elderly people and 2 grandchildren in a drunk driving accident was a liquor store owner.\n \n According to your logic, this would mean he was a drunk driver because he was a liquor store owner, therefore, all liquor store owners are drunk drivers.\n \n But according to my logic, instead of focusing on a mere \"feel good\" bit of information, I would look at the actual drunk driving records of liquor store owners. What if I found out that this was the only incident of a liquor store owner killing someone in the past 50 years?\n \n Which is closer to the truth: Your assertion that liquor store owners are all dangerous because of this one incident, or mine that they aren't because of the actual facts?\n \n The state of Virginia has no requirement for a CCW permit. CCW permits are available for request for those citizens who desire documentation in order to carry in other states. There have been over 225,000 permits issued in Virginia.\n \n This means: HOW MANY PEOPLE CARRY HAVING NOT REQUESTED A PERMIT? (We know at least 225,000 are carrying there because they have requested one).....let's be conservative and say that half of them have done so. This means that over 50% of gun carriers enjoy paperwork. My guess would be less than half desire documentation, but hey, I'm gonna be conservative.\n \n So, over 500,000 people carrying CCW in Virginia everyday and one of them goes nuts.\n \n This means that CCW holders account for less than 1/10th of 1 percent of shootings in Virginia. (It looks like this - <.01%) \n \n What's the murder rate for the general population in Virginia, Penfold?\n \n By stating that this one shooter had a CCW, are you trying to point out to us that the crime rate for CCW holders in Virginia is 20 times better than the general population, or 50 times better?\n \n Maybe you're trying to point out that it's 75 times better?\n \n Even if it's only 10 times better......\n \n ....it is still better (in multiples) than NON CCW holders!\n \n WHAT DO YOU FAIL TO GRASP ABOUT CCW HOLDERS COMMITTING SUBSTANTIALLY FAR FEWER CRIMES THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD?\n \n (BTW: This is just CCW holders in Virginia. Now go through the entire nation! ......and you point out that one has committed a murder! Wow! That's a real crime wave! One out of millions and millions! Whew! Maybe if another CCW holder commits another murder in a few more years IT WILL BE A TREND!)",

What are we supposed to judge its scale by?\n \n Let's put up something along side of it in order to compare its scope:\n \n How many people have been shot to death by NON CCW carriers in the same amount of time?\n \n Answer here:____________ (hello? Can you? Or will you fold and do nothing making your omission obvious? You know where my money's at.)\n \n Now, in comparison, who is safer?\n \n If you try and argue about how few CCW carriers are, it won't work. The statistic is something like .01% of CCW holders (in comparison with other CCW holders, not the general population) commits a crime!\n \n When you compare CCW holders with the general population IT TURNS OUT TO BE MORE LIKE .0000001%!\n \n Unable to grasp this? Look at all shootings since 1970. Did you say 125?\n \n HOLY COW!\n \n Check and see how many priests were convicted of shoplifting! See how many school teachers are convicted of assault and battery! See how many nuns have been charged with drunk driving!\n \n With numbers like you're putting up chances are they'll be higher!\n \n Yet, the way you spout out statistics, it's almost as if they're wonderful in, and of, themselves. They mean nothing unless you compare them to something else. This is the entire point of a statistic: comparison. \n \n Otherwise, the fact that 150 blind people killed cats in their microwave since 1974 means nothing. \n \n How many other people killed cats in their microwaves? If it's only 50, you might have a problem with blind people. If it's 500,000.....blind people don't look so bad. This is what the statistic is for.\n \n Now, quit mindlessly trying to slant your irrellevant data to bolster your incorrect argument by neglecting to offer a comparison. When you compare these pidly little number of shootings by CCW holders to the people without CCW permits, your argument can only demonstrate how CCW holders are umpteen times safer. When you compare CCW shootings by CCW holders to other CCW holders, the safety record is SUPERIOR to the general population. When you compare CCW holders to the ENTIRE POPULATION.....\n \n WOW! Stand back! \n \n Yet, you toss a meaningless statistic into the blue in a misguided attempt to merely appear to back up your argument.\n \n Where's the comparison? Or, is this simply a \"lie by omission\"?\n \n BTW: There are 50 children molested in Britain every day. There's a statistic for you.
