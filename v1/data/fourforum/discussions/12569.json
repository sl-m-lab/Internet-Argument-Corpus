   "Do yourselves a favor and click the link to see the accompanying videos. (I of course don't expect our resident homophobes to do any such thing. And, true to their nature, they won't. \"The ostrich only sees the dirt he sticks his head in.\")\n \n Jason Mannino: Homophobia Is Killing Our Youth\n \nToday is a significant day for silence, youth, and our schools. Today, across the country schools will participate in a National Day of Silence to protest the homophobic bullying that is killing teenagers and honor those whose lives have been taken by the barbaric hands of hatred.\n \n In less than two years there have been four brutal teenage deaths resulting from homophobic bullying. Just last week Carl Walker, an eleven year old in Springfield, Massachusetts, who never actually identified as gay, hung himself with an extension cord from the 3rd floor landing of his home. This was after his mother repeatedly implored his school to do something about the homophobic bullying he experienced. Last summer a transgendered teenager, Angie Zapata, was brutally murdered in Greeley, Colorado. Last February Eric Mohat, a 17-year old student from Ohio, who also never identified as gay, committed suicide after being repeatedly harassed with anti-gay epithets such as \"###\" and \"homo.\" His school went to trial last month as a lawsuit was filed by his parents, not because they want the school's money, but because they want to know why the school didn't respond to several requests for action. Also, last year, Lawrence King, a young black man who identified as gay, was shot in the head twice in his English class. He died a few days later. His heart was donated the day after Valentine's day. \n \n GLSEN (Gay, Lesbian, Straight, Education Network) and Harris Interactive recently conducted a study called \"From Teasing to Torment: School Climate in America, A Survey of Students and Teachers.\" The study illustrates that 33% of teens report that students are frequently harassed because they are openly or are perceived to be lesbian, gay, or bisexual. It also shows that LGBT students are three times as likely to say that they do not feel safe at school and 90% of LGBT students state that they have been harassed or assaulted. \n \n The FBI shows hate crimes based on sexual orientation to be the third most prevalent type. Regardless, George Bush vetoed the Matthew Shepard Act when it landed on his desk in 2007. This legislation would have protected people from hate crimes on the basis of perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. Wyoming, the state where Matthew Shepard was tortured and left tied to a fence to die in 1998, along with 18 other states, still does not have legislation that prosecutes hate crimes towards LGBT people. \n \n Change has been a pervasive concept in our country over the past two years. Barack Obama's presidential election, along with the dissolution of our economic institutions, are catalysts for significant change. We need to start applying this same principal of change to the institution of hatred entrenched in our culture. The Greek philosopher Aristotle, and social psychology pioneer Albert Bandura have both shown that aggression and hatred are learned behaviors. If a child is taught to hate and fear diversity, then the next place he or she expresses that hate is at school. Ten percent of all hate crimes occur at schools and colleges. If hate is learned, then it lies on the shoulders of our schools, church officials, parents, teachers, and communities to teach our young kids acceptance before they continue hurting each other, and before they become adults who will likely pass their hatred to the next generation. \n \n Dissolving hatred in our society starts with each of us on an individual level. Whether we are straight, LGBT, black, white or all shades in between, if we want to heal hate among youth we must engage in a process of introspective exploration to reveal where we ourselves have held onto hatred, ignorance, fear, and anger. Amidst all this homophobic murder, and without dismissing accountability; even those of us who feel justified in our animosity towards those who hate, must forgive our judgments. Hate in any form is still hate and it contributes to its survival. In the story of the crucifixion (whether myth or fact) Jesus says himself, \"Father forgive them, they know not what they do.\" \n \n I believe a direct result of my own marginalization has been the choice I have made to look inward and heal patterns of my own judgment and fear of those who choose to hate. My experience as a gay man in this society has generated in me a depth of compassion and empathy. This facilitates my understanding that people who choose to hate in the name of \"their\" God are simply immersed in a human experience that is built on irrationality, fear, hatred and ego; but for them, truthful, nonetheless. I choose to remember that those who choose to attack are attacking an illusion they have crafted in their own minds. Even those who have died in the name of self-love and expression have not truly died, because love that has known itself as long as man has existed cannot be destroyed. I cannot say when, but I have faith that one day those who attack in the name of \"their\" god will discover that they are also attacking themselves. \n \n When we heal the hatred and anger that lies in our own hearts and come to stand steadfast in our loving we become a beacon of light for the youth of our world. Youth who deserve to live long lives fully embraced, nurtured, and loved in the truth of who they are, regardless of seeming differences among sexual orientation, race, or gender. \n \n On this day when our youth silently protest violent homophobia, and honor those whose have been murdered or committed suicide, I implore you to take a few silent moments to begin to ask the tough questions: \"Where in my own life do I harbor hatred, fear, anger, and what steps can I take to begin to resolve it?\"\n",

I was beaten in the military for being Gay to the point to where I lost two pints of blood and blacked out several times. I went into the military knowing the risks but felt the cry to answer my nations call to defend her liberty and well being more important than my well being.\n \n Let me make this clear you CANNOT teach homosexuality. It cannot be taught. Can you teach me to be strait? It sure would make my life a hell of alot easier. As a teenager I used to pray every day and night to God to make me normal. I prayed to be strait. I prayed for the feelings of my stomach churning when a cute young guy walked past me in history to vanish. I prayed for the feeling of my heart jumping in my throat when me and another boy would kiss in secret, for fear that we would be beaten or punished by our families that it too, would go away.\n \n I was miserable.

I was in a hellish nightmare I couldn't wake up from. I, with tears steaming down my face inserted the barrel of a pellet handgun into my mouth. I wanted to end it. I wanted the pain and suffering to stop.\n \n Would I like so many other gay and lesbian youth before me become a statistic? I had written a letter to my parents explaining I was sorry for being a heathen and not a good christian. But for some reason and I now know the reason why, I didn't pull the trigger.

Those like Matthew Sheppard, and Courageous leaders like Harvey Milk, who were killed for who they were and what they stood for. \n \n The government does not teach being gay. It does teach however tolerance and knowledge that we being gay and lesbian are just like everyone else! It stops the ignorance that breeds the fear that breeds the hate which in turn breeds the senseless violence and hurt that so many feel.\n \n Today I sit here a young gay man.

That means a Son, a Daughter, a brother or sister, a family member, a friend, a student, a neighbor, a human being despairs and gives in. They feel trapped and cannot see any escape. \n \n I for one write this trying so hard to fight back tears knowing exactly the daily struggle these brave young people endure. And for those in the churches and on the grandstands, and on the airwaves to call these people sick and wrong. TO tell them to kill themselves because their not loved to their fellow classmates, and for those parents to reject their own flesh and blood and damn them is in itself the greatest form of hate and intolerance I can imagine.\n \n Jews, Handicapped, and Gays were killed under Hitler. In Iran, four men suspected of being gay were killed last week. Do you not see the suffering? Do these peoples cries fall upon deaf ears? Will no one stand up and realize these poor bright and young people need us?\n \n Do they have a voice? Who hear will cry out for them? Who here will stand in the market, in the street, in the pew, and defend them? Will anyone? I will. Knowing what these people have gone through I will. And even if my life is claimed by hate and ignorance. Even if I am beaten and broken I will stand for these people. \n \n Because they need a voice. because they need hope. You've got to give them hope said Harvey Milk. You've got to give the hope. Well for the youth in this country who are scared and alone and afraid have hope. God loves you, I love you, and you can know that tomorrow the sun will rise again, and that tomorrow, there are people who will fight for your rights and your lives. \n \n Who else on these forums will answer the call? Will you stop only at words or will you ACT? Will you take actions and stop this senseless hate? Do it! stand! Do what you know is right with fervor and conviction and be the voice!

I could copy and paste numbers out of a telephone book and your replies would be no different.\n \n \n \n I already said that, the main point is no to the word \"marriage.\" \n \n \n \n It's not a fear of indoctrination, it's the rejection of your teaching kids that it's ok for them to be gay. You say \"you cannot make someone gay or strait\" but you won't actually say if you would agree that we should not be teaching kids that it's ok to be gay.\n \n \n \n I honestly don't know if you are serious or just using dramatic rhetoric, but I will say that any insults I gave were preceded by insults you threw. \n \n \n \n Oh boy, there we go with the insults again. Your truth is bullsh!t. It's all drama. The bottom line is that I favor a popular referendum to decide gay marriage and you don't. You want to force society to accept you and indoctrinate kids, since you have this mental instability about being gay.\n\n \n I'm not unstable about being gay. Your a bigot and a insulting narrow minded basket case. Debating with you is like debating with Anita White. I really hope you don't work as a public official or a school counselor.

But thats the end of it.\n\n \n I don't think it's possible for anyone who opposes gay marriage to debate you. If someone disagrees with you, you insult them. Talking to you has been like watching a child throw a fit in a sandbox and then cry after being scolded.\n \n You claim to advocate for freedom, while at the same time insisting that only people who believe as you do should create laws and that there should be no popular vote on gay marriage. You cry about the sting of insults, and are the first to use them. You talk about love but lash out with the same hatred as the Westboro Baptist Church at people who disagree with passing laws from the bench or a state capital. Extremists on either end of the spectrum can be disgusting filth, which you've demonstrated by personal example.",

   "I am speaking of the ability of a male and a female to mate and create a child. Sorry, but a man and a man cannot do this, nor can a woman and a woman.\n\n A tractor and a trailer can't procreate a child either.\n Nobody is claiming that the male/male couple or female/female couple can procreate the child.\n For some illogical reason, you think they should... emoticon_frazzled\n \n By your logic, do you criticize couples who are together PAST their procreational years?\n Suppose a 40-year or 60-year old man and a 60-year old woman fell in love. Got married.\n They can't have kids. She's too old.\n Do you criticize them as well?\n \n \n \nemoticon_rolleyesTry genetic disorder\n\n Genetic disorder: A genetic disorder is a disease that is caused by an abnormality in an individual's DNA. Abnormalities can range from a small mutation in a single gene to the addition or subtraction of an entire chromosome or set of chromosomes.\n What are Genetic Disorders?\n \n So you're calling homosexuality a disease then...\n You really need to stop tossing out excuses and half-hearted reasoning and LEARN about the subject before you try to speak on it.\n It's like a kid only learning half the multiplication table, presuming to perform math problems TO CONTRADICT MATH EXPERTS to declare that certain math contradictions and \"disorders\" exists...\n \n Cause let's not forget that aspect of this issue either.\n You are NOT a professional, but you are pretending to supply a professional diagnosis. CONTRADICTING the professionals.\n \n \n \nThats odd...I believe hearing somewhere than 1 in 3 suicides among teenagers are caused by homosexuality...\n\n :xbanghead\n And if you look up the suicide rate of dentists, it's also much higher.\n The thing is that OUTSIDE STRESS CAUSES gays to commit suicide. OTHER PEOPLE doing stuff like saying \"being gay is a disorder\" wears gays down.\n It's not something inherent to being gay.\n \n \n \nI'm sorry, but adoption is not procreation.\n\n I see.\n So do you walk around telling any adopted children you meet that they are not the same as procreated children?\n \n People like you get stuck on \"procreation\" like a skipping record. You fail to recognize bigger issues and instead presume \"procreation\" is the end-all and be-all of relationships.\n The position is actually pretty arrogant\n \n I never said \"adoption is procreation\".\n The point is that gay couples CAN SERVE society in a variety of ways.\n EVEN by procreating, just requiring a little outside help.\n Although I imagine if a couple (straight) has to go to a sperm donor to have kids, you criticize them also? emoticon_wow\n \n \n \nExplain to me how being homosexual is beneficial.\n\n I JUST DID.\n Gays can adopt kids that straight people over-procreate. They can live their lives to further society without being distracted by kids.\n The ONLY thing that gay couples don't do that straight couples do is procreate through their inter-couple sex. That is IT.\n In fact, gay couples could have a LEG UP on the situation cause when they procreate, it's not by accident. They can PLAN for the child's arrival. Ensure that there is the financial availability and other planning to ensure that the child is appropriately cared for...\n \n While straight couples get child welfare...\n I see that as a disadvantage that heterosexual couples have that gay couples do not.\n \n \n \nI was not the one who brought up other animals, but to go on that train of thought, if an animal species needed to reproduce, would homosexual animals not harm the species by not procreating?\n\n Where is the logic in that?\n It's like saying \"We need doctors in order to help the sick so the species is not wiped out by disease. So isn't the species harmed by some members of society not being doctors?\"\n \n That's obviously silly cause we all realize that we do not need EVERYBODY to be a doctor.\n But for some reason, you seem to presume that a species will need EVERY couple to procreate in order to survive, which is also nonsensical.\n \n You keep approaching this backwards. You start out with your assumption (gay is a disorder) and then you try to justify it from there.\n If you would STOP and look at things in an overall sense absent of your assumption, you would realize your assumption was false.",

Many religions value the term marriage as a holy union between men and women. Therefore, gay marriage is disrespectful towards other religions. HOWEVER, that does not mean a union simply with another name cannot be created. Allow gays to have all the civil rights that come with marriage other than the term itself. The only actually right I would not want to give to gay couples is adoption. The healthiest environment for a child is one with a set of male and female parents.

Are you man enough to admit that? \n \n \n\n Considering I agree that child molestation should be illegal, your reply is nonsensical.\n There is no \"issue\" to \"take up\".\n \n\n \n It's a pity that you act contrarily to your claimed beliefs then.\n \n \n\n Compare that to the fact that possibly only one has seen fit to disagree, and that individual was Archie...\n \n You don't get credit for those who haven't bothered to address you...\n \n\n \n You have support from other gays for gay marriage, and in their hatred for me: an opponent of gay marriage. Congratulations, this really proves you are special.\n \n \n\n No. Not quickly.\n Like I said, I had been talking to Easyrider and Jyoshu for quite a while.\n Your assessment is like knowing a boss for several months before saying \"The boss isn't very good at his job\", and then somebody else comes along and accuses the person of making that claim \"quickly\".\n \n Several months of time went into that assessment, and that is not \"quickly\".\n\n \n Provide proof of this claim. \n \n You may speculate whatever you wish about how others will weigh in on my future comments, but you still did get caught lying and being a hypocrite, so whatever else happens, that's good enough for me. :)",
