Follow closely:\n \n When the universe was created, according to the big bang theory, everything started out in a very dense state and then explanded outwards. Now let's picture a balloon...(which acts as the universe) Now draw a black dot on that balloon...(this will represent the earth). Now, near that black dot, draw a red dot on the ballon..(this represents a star.) With me?\n \n Ok...now it's time to fill the balloon (the universe) at a high rate. Suddenly the space between the black and the red dots quickly increases as the balloon grows larger. Still with me?\n \n Ok...so we have the black dot (earth) and the red dot (stars), which were both created at the same time....and at first the stars and earth were much, much closer than they are now. Only from expansion have we separated. But the thing is, the starlight, which began at the moment of creation (and originally had far less distance to travel), had the benefit of its regular speed (whatever that was at the time) PLUS the expansion........So in otherwords, the speed of light is actually \"sped up\" exponentially by way of the extremely rapid expansion. So in a way, the light begins to \"fill in the gaps\" so to say, as the universe expands. \n \n Consequently, the light that we see today is probably light that was \"stretched to us\" ....it is not light that travelled to us all the way from a star untold lightyears away.

   "Clearly you need a lesson in physics. Electromagnetic radiation (of which visible light is just a tiny part of the spectrum) does not depend on the velocity of the object emitting that radiation.\n\n \n Ah but it might have been different when the universe was young. However I have seen estimates that the expansion rate had to fall below the speed of light by about 380,000 years:\\\n \n To wit from WIKI:\n \n \nThe earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models, the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with an incredibly high energy density, huge temperatures and pressures, and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10&#8722;35 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially.[22] After inflation stopped, the universe consisted of a quark-gluon plasma, as well as all other elementary particles.[23] Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle-antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and anti-leptons-of the order of 1 part in 30 million. This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.[24]\n \n The universe continued to grow in size and fall in temperature (and hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing). Symmetry breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form.[25] After about 10&#8722;11 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in particle physics experiments. At about 10&#8722;6 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton-antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons-antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 1010 of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by photons (with a minor contribution from neutrinos).\n \n A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion Kelvin and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis.[26] Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei. As the universe cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon radiation. After about 380,000 years the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation.[27]\n \n \n\n \n So if there was any possible stretching it could only alter the estimates from the CBR by some 380K years. Not much up against the 12-14 billion years for the age of the whole shebang.",

Physics is not a precise, definable science...so there's nothing to accept or reject -- it's all an interpretation or an opinion\n\n \n I don't recognize this version of physics, and I don't know where to begin to ask you to explain it. I'm going to take a stab in the dark, and begin with my notion of definable science. In physics, there are a number of foundational theories, including Newton's version of mechanics and gravity; the corpuscular and wave theories of light; Clerk-Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism; the luminiferous ether; statistical mechanics; thermodynamics; Special Relativity; General Relativity; Quantum Mechanics; The Standard Model; Quantum Supergravity; String Theory. That's not all, but it is sufficient for our discussion. Some of these theories are still held, some have been completely discarded, and some are currently in question at the margins. For example, General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are fundamentally incompatible at the energies (=temperatures) of the Big Bang or the core of a Black Hole.\n \n All of this, to me, is quite well-defined in several ways. Each theory can be clearly stated. The main evidence for and against each theory can be clearly stated. The history of each theory is well known. The history of physics, in the sense of which combination of theories is generally accepted, is also known. There are some notable errors and unprofitable side paths along the way, and there are brief transitions when the acceptance of one idea is going down, while another is rising to supplant it. \n \n You have something else in mind.

I would like to know what you personally believe, and not continue this pointless argument against strawmen.\n \n You say \"I don't accept ToE because I don't believe life is inherently accidental.\" Which accidents? The Big Bang? The current laws of physics? The arbitrary happenstance of which planet life originated on? Or the chance mutations that are part of evolutionary theory?\n \n I'm going to make another stab in the dark, and answer just the last question. ToE says that there are two forces in evolution: random mutation, and natural selection. So nothing arises only from random mutation. Mutations are also not just point mutations, with one base pair substituted for another. Genes can be swapped, duplicated, scrambled, and up- or down-regulated. Whole chromosomes can be duplicated or copied even more times, split into two separate chromosomes, or lost entirely.\n \n Nor does natural selection only act on individual random mutations. Every individual above the level of a single cell has a unique genome, combining expressed and unexpressed genes with and without random variations. Natural selection is simply the fact that some of these combinations are more beneficial than others in some circumstances. \n \n If there is a drought for several years, the more drought-tolerant plants become more common, and the ones that are overstressed by drought die out. Then if there is excess rain for several years, the ones that do better with more water increase in population percentage. This can be observed in subsistence agriculture using land-race corn, for example, as opposed to industrial monoculture where all the seeds are identical. It is also observed in wild grasses.\n \n Do you accept this so far? If not, which individual bits do you not believe? If so, where do you stop? Somewhere between here and the evolution of the eye, the wing, the flagellum? Be specific.",

   "Ah but it might have been different when the universe was young. However I have seen estimates that the expansion rate had to fall below the speed of light by about 380,000 years:\n \n So if there was any possible stretching it could only alter the estimates from the CBR by some 380K years. Not much up against the 12-14 billion years for the age of the whole shebang.\n\n \n Sorry, Chem99 1/4. That makes absolutely no sense. The expansion rate is measured by the Hubble \"Constant\" (something like 70 km/sec-megaparsec, with a very, very slow rate of change), which is not a velocity. It is a fractional change in distance per time period, not a distance per time period. So stars one million parsecs from us (3,200,000 light-years) would be moving away at 70 km/sec. Stars 4 billion parsecs from us would have their distance from us increase at nearly the speed of light, very nearly 300,000 km/sec.\n \n Now we think that it is possible for two points to be outside each other's Hubble volumes, at a bit more than 4 billion parsecs distance, meaning that the distance between them grows by more than one light-year per year. A photon starting out at one and moving at the speed of light toward the other never gets any nearer, so we obviously cannot see such an object, even if we could wait billions of years for the light that is leaving now. But that has nothing to do with the rate of stretching of light since the CBR broke free at a redshift of about 1000.\n \n Or are you thinking of the epoch of Inflation, which was well within the first second after the Big Bang? At that time the rate of expansion was much greater than the Hubble Constant, so that points within each other's Hubble volume before Inflation wound up outside each other's Hubble volume afterwards. But they didn't move apart. The space between them just got bigger.",

   "ToE says that there are two forces in evolution: random mutation, and natural selection.\n\n \n Just a technical point. Evolutionary theory does not require that mutations should be random. Molecular geneticists are well aware that some genes in some organisms mutate more often than others; alternatively, some genes are conserved more strongly than others. It's just that hotspots apart, there is no evidence for result-orientated directed mutation of genes. Within certain constraints, they appear to be random, but evolutionary theory as such doesn't demand that they should be.\n \n Second, natural selection through competition for resources isn't the only force constraining evolution (though it is the major explanation of adaptation). There is also genetic drift which can distribute neutral mutations through populations, and there are probably also other factors such as structural constraints and canalisation affecting which mutations can see the light of day (i.e. get exposed to natural selection) and which will not.",

   "That too. Still, one could look at any rearrangement or duplication of a genome as a mutation if one's definition were broad enough, but if some want to be narrower in definition, it's fine with moi. Another interesting factor in evolution is symbiosis, though again that would take appropriate genomic rearrangements on the part of both partners to make it work smoothly. I was really arguing that reducing any theory of evolution to two factors, random mutation and natural selection, is to do it serious injustice and in essence tie both hands behind one's back against evolution deniers. :)",
