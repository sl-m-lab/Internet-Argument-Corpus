   "Quite frankly, this is a perfect example of the inanity and sometimes \"double standards\" of some people.\n They have no problem with violating the \"convictions\" of people who are against blacks. Against Jews. Against women.\n But when it comes to the \"convictions\" of those against gays, it's another story.\n \n What really amuses me is how I have come across some people who profess that they want gay equality and protection against employment discrimination, but then they bend over backwards to advocate against it when it comes to actually implementing it.\n Suddenly, the language of employment discrimination protection which has been used for a variety of other issues like race, religion, gender, etc becomes too ambiguous and cumbersome when it comes to protecting gays.\n Suddenly, the HYPOTHETICAL of a law-suit inconveniencing an employer is a show-stopping argument as opposed to actual documented discrimination against gays.\n \n And from a religious stance, WHAT THE HECK???? emoticon_wow \n Isn't everybody a sinner under the Christian dogma?\n Where does the bible say \"If you're a Christian, you gotta fire the gays. But when it comes to those who are on their second marriage, lusting after another man's wife, break the speed limit thus violating governmental laws, take the lord's name in vain? Those guys aren't sinning enough to warrant firing them...\"\n Tying a LOT of this \"gay employment discrimination\" junk to religion is pure bunk. Religion provides just as much of an excuse to discriminate against Jews as they don't acknowledge the Christ as god, violating the first commandment.\n The religion becomes an excuse for prejudice they don't show to other sinning categories.\n (And I'll say in advance to head off the inevitable strawman arguments, I said \"a LOT\" because I see exceptions for view-points of \"gay pastors\" and the like as long as they take other persistent \"sins\" as similarly necessary grounds for impeachment.)\n \n The \"I'm the victim here because I can't make gays the victim of discrimination\" is abundant, and mind-numbingly devoid of realistic logic.\n (But it is a clear minority, as a vast majority approve of legislation preventing discrimination against gays.)\n Just ask Steeeeve how preventing him from discriminating having the government discriminate against gays is similar to gays being actively discriminated against by the government... emoticon_xdonno",

   "Can't you? Why not?\n\n \n That's an interesting question. Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, an employer cannot fire someone because of their religion. I think an employer would be barred from firing someone simply because they hold anti-gay beliefs if those beliefs are part of their religion. But if an employee brought those anti-gay beliefs into the workplace and acted on them, through anti-gay speech or other actions, and the employee thereby created a hostile environment for gay employees, I think that would probably be different under the law. The employee might then be violating the employer's sexual harassment policy. And this would, I think, make an interesting legal case if the employer were to fire the person for making anti-gay statements at work, and the employee were then to turn around and sue for religious discrimination, which is barred by federal law. I think a court would have to address whether the anti-gay speech was central to the person's religion, and I suspect the court would find for the employer, not the employee. A court would probably rule that holding anti-gay beliefs out of one's religion is a protected right, but acting on those anti-gay beliefs at work through speech or other actions is not. \n \n I am not a civil rights lawyer, though I find this area of law fascinating. I am not a lawyer at all; I am a history professor. I bet there have been cases like this, and we could probably track some down if we looked. I imagine the EEOC has heard complaints like this.",

   "Getting back to Jim Jordan's argument, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 also required employers to potentially violate their \"religious convictions\" by not discriminating on the basis of race. Today most people do not believe in race discrimination as one of their religious convictions, but that was not the case in 1964, or for most of American history. \n \n A central debate that swirled around the employment section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was whether the government should have the power to tell private employers what their employment practices should be. Many conservatives and libertarians saw the debate as not about race so much as about federal power versus the rights of individual employers to choose whatever employees they want and to discriminate if they want to for whatever reasons they want. They argued that barring states from enacting or preserving segregation laws or other discriminatory laws was one thing, but telling private employers that they must not discriminate was, in their view, big brother reaching in to deny them their individual liberty. The constitutional source of federal power to do this rested on the commerce clause, on the power of the Congress to regulate \"commerce among the several states.\" \n \n The issue of government regulation of private business has been a longstanding source of controversy in U.S. history. The controversy has extended not only to questions of discrimination in hiring, but to questions about working hours, working conditions, minimum wages, environmental consequences of doing business, and to the consequences to consumers of business practices. \n \n This controversy is not going away anytime soon, and there is the possibility that the Supreme Court will roll back the power of the federal government to regulate private business under the commerce clause. This could be a significant consequence of President Bush's appointment of conservatives to the Supreme Court. We will have to stay tuned.",

   "Not true. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which is a federal law, prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, national origin, religion, and sex. Since the passage of that act, discrimination on the basis of age and disability status have also been made illegal under federal law. These laws apply to private employers with over a certain number of employees. There is no requirement that they be participants in federal programs. \n \n There is currently no federal law prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and that is what ENDA is intended to do. The recent controversy over ENDA was generated by the stripping out of language from that bill that would ban discrimination on the basis of gender identity as well as sexual orientation. \n \n The constitutional basis for the federal government's power to prohibit employment discrimination by private employers is the commerce clause.\nPerhaps this will explain it properly. It appears that in ALL STATES a person who does not have a contract can be fired for any reason...including no reason.

It essentially means that, in the absence of employment contracts that indicate otherwise, employers generally may fire employees for any reasons, no reasons and even unfair reasons, as long as they are not illegal reasons.\n \n \n Grammatically speaking, the term at will should be hyphenated, as in employment at-will states or at-will employment states. But, because not everybody knows that, we omit the hyphen to make it easier for visitors to find this article in a Web search.\n \n Subsequently, it's no surprise that, after getting fired from their jobs, some employees immediately want to know if the states in which they work are among the so-called \"employment at will states\" (also referred to as \"at-will employment states\" or \"hired at will states\").\n \n That's especially true when employees get fired for no apparent reasons or seemingly unfair reasons.\n \n Which are Employment at Will States?\n All states are employment at will states, meaning that they all uphold the Doctrine to some degree. To what degree regarding employers' rights to discharge employees, varies by state. \n \n Montana is unique in the degree at this writing, in that it upholds employment at will only when employees are working during a probationary period. Outside of that, employers in Montana must have good cause to discharge employees.\n \n For the rest of the states, the degree at which they uphold the Doctrine and what constitutes good cause under it, depends on the exceptions they recognize.\n \n Which Employment at Will States Recognize Exceptions?\n All employment at will states recognize certain statutory exceptions to the Doctrine, while many also recognize one or more common-law exceptions. Both types of exceptions render the Doctrine inapplicable when discharging employees.\n \n In other words, if employers ignore state-recognized exceptions when discharging employees, then the courts will likely, in effect, rule that the employers did not have good cause under the Doctrine, meaning that the Doctrine didn't apply. Such discharges are illegal and collectively referred to as wrongful discharge, more commonly called wrongful termination.\n \n Typically, the more common-law exceptions that a state recognizes, the less it upholds the Doctrine regarding employers' rights to discharge employees.

So is running an unsafe factory, or requiring workers to work 70 hours a week at close to zero pay. So is pouring toxic waste into the rivers. \n \n The Supreme Court has long recognized that rights have limits, particularly when they conflict with other rights. Requiring segregation by law is not a right of the people, though white Southerners claimed that it was, and for many years the Supreme Court allowed this to be the case. Then the Court reversed itself. Race discrimination in employment was for years a barrier to most African Americans and people of other races gaining employment that provided real opportunities for them. Then the federal government banned this discrimination, and it made a huge difference in the opportunities open to real people. The same is true of sex discrimination. Women are now hired for positions from which we were previously shut out. My father, who recently passed away, worked as an engineer for a large company: Monsanto. He said that before the Civil Rights Act banned sex discrimination in employment, Monsanto would not hire women as engineers or in other professional positions. They simply refused. Then they were forced to hire women, and that was a positive social benefit. \n \n Laissez-faire is not part of the constitution. There is no right for employers to do anything they please.

Whether its pro-racism, anti-racism, pro-gay or anti-gay, it doesn't matter.\n\n \n Real social harm is actual harm. Not imaginary harm, real harm. Dumping toxic waste into a river is actual harm to the environment and to the society, which is social harm. The solution to such harm is government regulation. And the example of a company dumping toxic waste into a river shows that business is not a purely private association. \n \n Workers used to be forced to work for 12 hours a day for extremely low wages. They were not slaves, because they earned wages, and they were not legally the property of their employers. They were forced by economic circumstance and an inability to get employers to raise their wages. They also worked under appalling conditions. They appealed to state governments and eventually to the federal government to regulate working conditions, wages, and hours of employment. Now we have the Fair Labor Standards Act, which sets minimum wages, maximum hours, and provides other protections for non-unionized workers. This law also bans child labor. It was passed in 1938. \n \n Widespread discrimination in employment most certainly DID do actual harm to a great many people. African Americans were simply shut out of most high and medium-paying jobs for most of American history. Women were likewise shut out of most jobs that paid a decent wage. The harm was real, not imaginary. \n \n We do pass laws to create the kind of society we want. I believe that the society we want maximizes liberty, meaning we should not use laws to deny people liberty just because we don't like what those people are doing. At the same time, there are practices by businesses and by individuals as well as government that do real harm to society and to individuals. That is the justification for passing laws to eliminate or minimize the harm that they are doing. It often comes down to balancing competing liberties. Does the right of a business owner to do business as he or she chooses trump the right of citizens to have clean rivers, or to breathe clean air? No it doesn't. Does the right of an employer to do business as he or she chooses trump the right of employees to be paid a decent wage or to work in safe conditions? No, it doesn't. If you want to do business in this country, you have to obey the laws that require you to honor the rights of the public. \n \n You appear to be very concerned that people will pass laws that deny rights for no good reason, and that does happen sometimes. That happens to gay people with the laws barring same-sex marriage. They reflect people's religious beliefs and that's all. The laws barring same-sex marriage have no rational basis, and certainly no compelling state interest to justify them. But that does not mean that all regulatory laws have no rational basis or no compelling state interest. I think our goal should be to get rid of those government restrictions that do not serve a real public interest, while leaving in place those that do. Laws that ban discrimination in employment do serve the public interest. They do prevent harm to many individuals and to the society.",

I hope someone does something about those evil employers, offering people money to perform services.\n\n \n Social harm is not entirely subjective, as the example of the toxic waste illustrates. Toxic waste dumped in a river does harm not only to property owners, but to the whole community that uses the river. All kinds of people and animals use the river, not just property owners along the river. Dumping toxic waste into a river can have long term negative on the environment and on human health. The toxins can get into the fish, and humans then eat the fish, and the toxins get into people. These may be people who don't live anywhere near the river, but they are still negatively affected by the dumping of toxic waste. \n \n I think it's quite clear how a business dumping toxic waste is not entirely private. They are using and dumping waste into the river that belongs to all the people. If you want to do business in our country, you enter the public arena, and you will be subject to regulation. That's how it is, and that's how it should be. Businesses don't get to do whatever they please. \n \n I am surprised that you would praise a business that subjects its workers to unsafe working conditions and forces them to work 12 hours a day at next to no wages. That's how workers suffered in Andew Carnegie's steel plants 100 years ago. That's how workers suffered in the Triangle Waist Company in New York. There, in 1911, the factory caught on fire. There were garments and cloth strewn about, and they caught fire. The owners had locked the doors to prevent workers from sneaking out, and so workers could not escape. The elevators quickly broke down. Many young immigrant working women were driven to jump to their deaths on the pavement below rather than burn in the fire. The fire led to a campaign in New York to enact a strict fire safety code. Businesses could no longer do what they pleased and let employees die as a consequence.",

Murder remains immoral even if you think Jesus never existed.\nNot hurting animals is a secular moral? I hardly see the logic behind that from a secular standpoint. Please tell me how a secularist comes to this conclusion.\n \n \nThe problem with your religion, Steve, is it doesn't understand the nature of love, especially sexual love, and is frightened to bits by it.\nOn the contrary.

   "This is a tricky question, whether a law is entirely religiously based or has a secular purpose. It's tricky because there is of course much overlap between religious morality and secular morality, the interests of a broader civil society that encompasses many different religious beliefs and outlooks. We have a long history in this country of allowing religious beliefs to dictate secular laws. An example is in the so-called \"blue laws\" that used to prohibit Sunday store openings. I don't know that any court ever struck those laws down. Over time, the interests of businesses in selling products every day and the interests of consumers in shopping on Sundays led legislatures to eliminate the blue laws. Some people did object to this change, arguing that the blue laws did have a secular purpose in providing workers with a day of rest that employers could not take away. But these folks lost that debate. Now the only places I see with stores closed on Sundays are in the Amish communities here in Ohio. \n \n I think that as we have become more religiously diverse, the issue of whether one faith is imposing its morals on everyone else has become more keen. To me it seems clear that the laws banning polygamy are based purely in religion and have no primarily secular purpose. There are quite a few societies where polygamy is legal. But the Supreme Court shut the door many years ago on challenges to the law by polygamists.\n \n It seems to me that the first amendment establishment clause has been interpreted and applied inconsistently by our Supreme Court. And this blurry area of what is constitutional and what is not remains still blurry because of this.",

   "Secularists can be moral but it is illogical for them to have a sense of morality.\n\n \n Why? A sense of morality doesn't come from god, it's an evolved human trait. Secularists possess it as much as religious believers. They just do not rationalise moral behaviour the way you seem to, based on the fear of your god. Anyone who behaves morally solely because he fears god is a danger to himself and others.\n \n \nNot hurting animals is a secular moral? I hardly see the logic behind that from a secular standpoint. Please tell me how a secularist comes to this conclusion.\n\n \n Animals feel pain. It's bad to cause pain to another sentient organism, because if you assume the right to be able to cause pain to others, you are in no position to complain when they cause it to you. It's a version of the Golden Rule principle, which works for secularists as well as it works for believers. It's a staple, too, of scientific theories about the evolution of a moral sense. Some of Christ's teaching is based on the same notions, as are the teachings of many religions and philosophies besides Christianity.\n \n \nMy religion is love and if you reject that you only know evil.\n\n \n I accept love, but I see none in your chosen religion, which is one of several reasons I have no interest in it, but just want to keep it off my back. :) If you don't mind.",

   "This is a tricky question, whether a law is entirely religiously based or has a secular purpose...\n\n \n I don't think it's as tricky as all that. It depends on what you think laws are for. Some people seem to think that laws exist to make people moral, or at least compel them to behave overtly as if they were moral. This prompts the question of, whose morality? Theirs, of course, not yours.\n \n However, I think you can make a more minimalist argument: laws exist to minimise conflict between individuals. If you believe in individual rights and liberties, then laws should be minimal, and focussed on discouraging public behaviour that injures others. A law against murder would thus be justifiable, because murder injures the victim and destabilises society. It wouldn't matter that most religions would also consider murder immoral.\n \n In a libertarian society, laws do not exist to enforce anyone's vision of what morality ought to be. They exist because they accomplish some practical purpose, which may or may not be congruent with someone's notions of what is moral. Now, I am not by any stretch of the mind a libertarian, however, i do believe that's a fine principle.",

   "For one that certainly wouldn't disprove it came from God and two how do you know its a human trait?\n\n \n Because all human societies have moral systems and codes, bar none. The secular as well as the religious. I know it didn't come from god, because god doesn't exist, and in any case, theistic societies had many different gods, none of whom said exactly the same things, yet they all had moral codes. I know it evolved, because humans evolved, and we can see elements of proto-morality in species not too dissimilar from our ancestors.\n \n \nThere is no rational reason to have morals if you are a secularist but it certainly doesn't mean you don't have morals and I never claimed it did.\n\n \n What planet are you from, steve? Of course there are many rational reasons for secularists to behave morally, if they wish to live in a stable and secure society. They have to behave in ways commensurate with such a society, otherwise, it's the law of the jungle. Why would any sane secularist want that?\n \n \nThen we should all be vegetarians?\n\n \n You could make that argument. I wouldn't want to go that far myself, but many moralists, and atheists among them, do argue strongly for vegetarianism and even veganism. Disagree with them if you like, but their case doesn't rely on a deity, but on the suffering caused by cruelty to animals.\n \n Perhaps you think that causing suffering for personal gain is moral, but if so, it must be your god telling you this, because reason won't get you there.\n \n \nFurthermore, the number of beliefs shown in your statement is unreal for a person that claims no religious views.
