   "I guess this is as much of a political debate as anything. I want to know what everyone thinks about the China and Taiwan issue. Although China has put up with a no response from Taiwan for quite some time, I doubt that this is going to hold up forever. Eventually Taiwan will have to either declare independence or China will have to declare war on Taiwan to get them back.\n \n My political question is, if China were to attack Taiwan, do you think the US would step in?\n \n I've done some research on this topic and it is believed that China wouldn't simply march into Taiwan and capture it quickly. It would be a long fight. So assuming China has surprise attacked Taiwan but hasn't been able to capture it leaving options open for the US to set up bases in Taiwan, would they even come to the rescue of a country as insignificant as Taiwan and risk a nuclear war with China?\n \n I'm very curious to see what people from both the US and other countries think about this.",

   "Broker, I think your probably correct that we couldn't beat the Chinese in a traditional war. However, there is little doubt that the US would defeat China if push really came to shove. China has about 800 nukes and the US has closer to 12,000 and perhaps even has a viable nuclear defense system. A laser system has already been tested and shown promise in destroying incoming nuclear weapons. It will be just a matter of time before nuclear war against the US is an impossibility. So China has a limited amount of time to decide whether to attack Taiwan or give it up. I believe an attack is imminent and that it could drive all of Asia into a state of conflict.\n \n I believe for the sake of peace, the US will launch a conventional attack to keep China off of Taiwan and that China will in turn declare war on the US. The UN will jump in and Russia will pledge support for the US while avoiding getting into the conflict. China will stand alone against the world and will have no choice but to surrender. This senario I believe has a happy ending where Taiwan becomes independent and no significant loss of life occurs. If the US doesn't defend Taiwan however, I believe the Chinese will take it as a sign of weakness on the world and will not stop after the capture of Taiwan and may later support North Korea in a war against South Korea.\n \n In short, I believe the US has to prevent a Chinese invasion of Taiwan at all costs.",

Besides, hitting China with a thousand or so nukes would wipe out life not only in China, but in most of Asia (including Taiwan), and possibly (we don't know until we try) in the whole world (including the US).\n\n \n The fact isn't that we would be hurt in a war with China. The fact is that China knows we would win a war against them. Even if 800 nukes hit America, they would still be completely destroyed. Mutual destruction. And that is if they attack now. If they wait, it could be a one sided war if by some amazing achievement America is able to find a way to shoot down all nuclear weapons.\n \n Why do you think China is so angry that America is looking to find a way to shoot down nuclear weapons if the continental shield system is impossible? It will create an arms race to build up defensive weapons instead of offensive. That would benefit everyone involved if suddenly nuclear weapons were worthless to use against the most powerful nations in the world.\n \n Now do I believe America would attack China if it meant we would get nuked? That is a question I hope will never need to be answered but if push does come to shove, eventually a nuclear conflict will be necessary. Here is the situation I'll lay out for you: China invades Taiwan suddenly and performs tactical nuclear strikes to conquer it quickly. It lays down a demand that no other country interfere but it knows the US will do so and is prepared to go all out against us if we do. Now if your China, you know a pre-emptive strike by the US would come so quickly that it would eliminate a lot of the Chinese ability to retaliate. The only option they would be left with is a pre-emptive strike of their own or take a chance that the US will do nothing. The US will be in a similar position only they won't need to worry about nuclear subs hanging around our borders or having our retalitory strikes be made ineffective. Given this situation, what do you think China and the US would do?\n \n Personally I believe the US would make a surprise attack and destory all the nuclear capabilities of China without hitting populated targets. That would be such a great option that the US couldn't pass it up especially if it means protecting the US from a possible 800 nuclear weapon strike attack. China will be thinking this as well but will not willingly launch on the US without very, very good cause. This will leave the door wide open for a US pre-emptive strike without a real fear of Chinese pre-emptive strike and would ensure us a victory although probably at a great cost unless we have some sort of defense. China of course may not even retaliate for this. Nuking the US would be complete suicide and if they were to guess that we were only hitting their nuclear sites, perhaps they would see it wise to surrender before it gets serious enough where their entire populations are whiped out. China has a long history of being passive in that sort of way but not when it comes to Taiwan.\n \n Anyways, I think if nothing was done, China would become more aggressive over time as their population began to feel the excitement of victory. North Korea may not be a good friend now, but if a cold war begins between China and the US, North Korea is an enemy of an enemy to China. They would support them and perhaps even gain the support of Russia who may begin to fear the power of their hated neightbor the EU who is allied with the US. If it is allowed to get to this point, there is no simple way to turn back. However, when it is at the stage of just China invading Taiwan, it can be turned around and perhaps WWIII won't have to break out because of it. If China is allowed to take Taiwan, I fear WWIII will happen because of it.",

Although the Taiwan army would probably surrender quickly once the Chinese landed, it can be expected that with the technology Taiwan has that they could hold off an attack until the US got over there to help defend it. If China wanted to take Taiwan, they would need to do it before the US go there and that would no doubt require tactical nuclear weapons.\n \n My guess is that you are right about one thing though, China probably has no plans to attack the US even if the US is to launch an attack on China to protect Taiwan.

They would claim to be liberating them, not occupying. You don't nuke someone you claim to liberate.\n\n \n They wouldn't need to actually destory the entire island. All they need is a way onto the island. Depending on who you ask, the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear weapon can take down power and communication over a wide area without killing people. Using a tactical weapon to do so would leave all Taiwan planes grounded and armies in chaos. If this wouldn't work, then they would likely have to nuke an area that would take down communication and power. This doesn't mean nuking an entire city, but maybe a couple square blocks with a small tactical weapon. China has an unknown number of small tactical nukes that would be perfect for this. Strategic nukes would stay in the silos.\n \n \nNonsense. Of course China would defend itself with nuclear weapons against a nuclear attack. Why else do you think they have them?\n\n \n It depends on the attack and depends on the situation. If Russia were to launch 5 nukes at the US without good cause what would we do? Would we retaliate with 5 nukes? Would we launch everything we got and ensure that Russia would follow? Or would we simple wait and see what came next before doing anything at all? 5 nukes will not break down an entire system like ours. It would be an important and quick decision. Who knows what would happen but I'm sure this senario has been played out before in war games.\n \n What would China do if they knew the US had launched a strike to take out their own nuclear weapons but not a strike to hurt their people? Lets say 5 nukes from US, all to arrive within 2 minutes or less. Would they retaliate and actually nuke the US and ensure that thousand of nukes would land in their backyard? There is no good answer but the logical one would be to back down. The Chinese are smart in this way based on their history and beliefs.

To \"kill\" electronic devices, you must explode a very powerful nuclear bomb in the stratosphere. And the effect is spread over the large area, so it would be hard to avoid disabling their own devices.\n\n \n It is really unknown what the effects of a nuclear blast would be in the stratosphere since the atmosphere is able to collect so much of this energy well before it ever gets to ground level. Perhaps a large nuke would over come this or perhaps a large nuke would go too far. Perhaps a small nuke wouldn't work at all and perhaps it would work just as well as was needed. Anyways, assuming there is a way to get this to work it will prevent a substancial loss of human life and would allow China to make its move on Taiwan quickly before the US and UN can react.\n \n \n\n Ground or air (tropospheric) explosions produce no such effect beyond the area of physical destruction.\n\n \n This is the type of thing that would be used as a strike on a city to take down power or communication although the EMP effect wouldn't be significant beyond that city.\n \n \n\n We would launch enough to obliviate them (and hopefully to take out the rest of their nukes before they launch more). That is the only reasonable strategy for such a situation.\n\n \n That is a scarry decision to make. First off if Russia did launch on us first, then they are no doubt prepared for a counter attack. Hoping that we can take out their nukes before they see ours is hoping beyond hope. 2 minutes is a long time for a nuke to go unnoticed and 2 minutes would only be achieved by subs very close to Russia territory. Doubtful that we could surface many subs in that area safely especially in the case of nuclear conflict. So basically taking out their retalitory capability is out of the question. Same goes for Russia to the US, unless they have a dramatic amount of suitcase nukes in place before they launch the attack and this would be a very, very coordinated event and unlikely to happen.\n \n Why would the US launch a full out nuclear attack if only 5 were launched at us? If only 5 were used, then it is almost 100% likely that they were a mistake or that a rogue group launched them. There is no way the US would retaliate that quickly and severely to something that makes no sense at all. What is more likely is that Russia would soon after contact the US and state what had occurred. The US would have taken massive damage but it would still be intact. The same cannot be said if we launched a full scale nuclear attack and get the same retaliation back at us. It would make no sense to commit national suicide because 5 rogue nukes hit us. However there would be a need for some sort of closure for the American people and ego. Russia would pay dearly in one way or another depending on what actually happened.\n \n \n\n They would cause more damage and loss of life than the US has suffered in all wars, private conflicts and accidents in its history taken together.\n\n \n Lets assume the same for China. 5 nukes on them would cause more damage than they could even imagine. However they are targeted at low population locations anyways. They know the US isn't going for a kill strike and is just looking to defend themselves against a nuclear attack. Tough call on what they would do but they would know of course that any attack on the US would be the end of China and the people of China would not like that any more than the US would like to see the US completely destroyed over something that in the grand scheme of things didn't really matter.\n \n EDIT: One thing I have to add to this is that China has said that it will never again back down from an aggressor. They would also hate to lose their only threat against the US in losing their nuclear capabilities. These two things would greatly press China to retaliate quickly. A small attack at that point would make no sense since all their nukes are in danger so the only option would be a full attack. The US would do the same against China since there would be no need to keep any nukes in the silos at that point. The US and China would be suddenly disappear and Taiwan would be all that really would survive. To quote the movie 'War Games', \"Winner: None\"\n \n \n\n No, the logical strategy is the one that would deter such an attack, and that means commitment to all-out retaliation.\n\n \n A very good example. I hadn't even considered this. It would perhaps steer the US away from a first strike and would allow China to have the upperhand. However, would it be a bluff or for real? Would the US respond to this by given China a deadline to step down and simply jump the deadline by a small amount of time and get a major surprise attack?\n \n This would be taken as a dare to the US at about the same time that the US was starting to get information on the Taiwan takeover. It might actually encourage the US to stand up for Taiwan to a further extent although it is more likely that the US would take the threat very seriously and look for more international support before moving forward. The US would of course be able to get this support simply because China is acting as such an aggressor. They could actually end up getting singled out away from the entire world and that could lead to their own downfall. Complete economic isolation.\n \n \n\n A nuclear conflict between them is automatically a world war.\n\n \n That is debatable thought not very important. Two superpowers going to war would likely bring in more countries that could scale it into a world war but I doubt that two countries at war would officially make it a world war.\n \n \n\n Why? It takes a damn big idiot to start one.\n\n \n Why was avoiding a world war during the cold war a miracle? Lets just say the two sides were not building up a huge amount of nuclear weaposn for no apparent reason. Both sides on high alert at all times, anger, power struggle, ideologies, and even the Korean War or Vietnam War or Cuban Missile Crisis could have set it all off. Anything goes wrong and the US and Russia are holes in the ground. This went on for years and year and years too. Avoiding a world war III already is probably the most amazing miracle the world has ever known and we just take it for granted now and thankfully were able to do so.\n \n Also it doesn't take just one big idiot to start a cold war. Things are a little more complicated than that. One thing that does seem a little simple is that the two biggest guys never seem to like each other and there is not always any good reason for it. Things just go wrong sometimes too. No really expaining why a cold war would begin and why a world war would occur, but history does seem to repeat itself so it is likely we haven't seen the end of cold wars or world wars.",

They won't jeopardize that over Taiwan, nor in any attempt to 'extend their empire' into South-East Asia.\n\n \n 1. China doesn't really need a navy in order to battle Taiwan. They have several options including artillery which can easily reach Taiwan from the Chinese mainland, an airforce which can attack Taiwan, as well as tactical and strategic nuclear missiles. China is also rapidly moving forward to becoming a superpower and will have a strong navy one day. They don't need to risk anything until they are prepared to do so. When they are ready who will stop them if they do invade?\n \n 2. Taiwan has a legitimate defensive network but so did Germany before D-Day. Taiwan doesn't have the manpower or the military to fight off China and lets not forget that China does have over a billion people and isn't afraid to lose a few million of them. Taiwan would eventually fall even in a conventional war without support.\n \n 3. The PRC probably wouldn't risk war with the US over Taiwan. However they have backed themselves into a corner after years of saying a war is coming to Taiwan as well as saying they will not back down to any country ever again. So will they back down to the will of the US and not attack? Maybe for a time this will hold true but not forever.",

They have one real option when it comes to attacking the US and that is ICBMs. That option would of course lead to a world v China war if not a complete nuclear retaliation from the US and in either case that they cannot win. China has been digging itself a hole for so long that I guess I wouldn't be too surprised if it leads to war against the US.

   "china will occupy taiwan\n if US is involved in this war ,we will use tactical nuke to destroy all US's conventional force and all the short range missile base near china.\n\n \n Then lets say that the US backs off at this point. China leaves themselves looking like a horrible nation and ruins their entire image. They are pulled from the WTO, cut economic ties with countries all across the world, and suffer economic sanctions for many years to come. In the world of globalization China would collapse.\n \n Another option would be for the US to press the rest of the world to help them at this point. The US would have the moral high ground and the political connections to turn this into WWIII against China. I don't think the world is ready to stand by and watch any country use nuclear weapons when invading another country against the will of much of the world.\n \n A third option would be for the US to respond with tactical strikes of their own. We have more tactical missiles anyways and could easily outlast the Chinese in a tactical missile battle. The Chinese naval forces would be in ruins and no inevitably this would push the Chinese to make a decision. Either give up the war against Taiwan and back down to the US or launch strategic nukes against the US. So China has two options they would rather not have and the result of one option means loss of honor and prestige while the other means total destruction.\n \n \nwe will not attack US's mainland,but if US decide to use its long range missle attack china mainland,our missle will launch ten minutes after us's missle.\n\n \n Do you think that China would do so if they were backed into a position where they faced either destroying the US or losing the war in Taiwan?\n \n Anyways ten minutes is a long time for nukes to land. With the US capabilities we will be able to make first strikes within 3-5 minutes. If this was done China would stand to lose a great deal of it's retalitory capabilities.\n \n \nmaybe we dont have enough missile ,so our target is not your military base,it is your people.\n\n \n Once again looking to turn the world on China. This type of action will not be stood for.\n \n So far what you have spelled out is disaster for China over and over if they were to invade Taiwan. Nuclear attacks against the US would be devastating but not complete destruction.\n \n \nmaybe only a hundred million people in china can survive at the end ,we still will thank US govement,china has been bothered by the population problem for a long time and you US help us solve this big problem.chinese will establish a democratic govement like US after war .\n\n \n If the US really did want to destroy all of China then it would get done. However you can pretty much assume that the US would be looking to take parts of China for themselves and for the rest of the world to make up for losses faced in the US therefore the US would use nuclear weapons to break down the government and military of China.\n \n China probably would become a democracy and the US would help the people of China solve their biggest problem right now but by that time it would no longer be seen as the biggest problem. The biggest problem now would be millions and millions dead and more dying everyday. This is a horrible price to pay and worse than the average Chinese person would be willing to exchange for democracy at this time especially if only 1 out of every 10 lived.\n \n \nmaybe the new leader of the world are russia and india,would your american accept this result?\n\n \n If the Chinese made the first strike then you are probably correct that the US would never again be a world power. But if the US made the first strike and took out most of the Chinese capabilities the US would probably be hurt badly but not be turned into a third world country. I'd also think that the EU would become the world leader if the US was to fall from power.\n \n \ngo to hell american people,democracy and freedom are just your excuse.\n the real reason is that you must find an excuse to prevent china become the next super power.\n 99 percent people in china know they dont have a democratic govement ,but they can wait ,they know the day will come sooner or later.just think china is involved in your civil war and help the south,what will the north do!\n\n \n Democracy and freedom are an excuse for what? An excuse to invade other nations? China is the one who wishes to invade, not the US. The US wishes to protect Taiwan as they have done nothing to deserve what China wishes to bring down on them. Do you not see anything wrong with China's wish to invade Taiwan? How does democracy and freedom tie into that?\n \n The US does not wish to prevent China from becoming a super power. China, India, Russia, the EU, and US will one day all be super powers if we can maintain relative peace. So does the US wish to prevent India, Russia, and the EU from becoming super powers as well? No. Protecting Taiwan is not done to prevent the rise of Chinese power. It is for protecting our ally against aggression from China.\n \n I don't understand your comparision of our Civil War and China. If it is a communist government (South) and democratic government (North) then how do you see the US supporting the South?\n \n \nif iraq is a monkey,eastern can wait the monkey evolves to human.\n but your occidental just want to kill them,if you really believe democracy and freedom.pls go back to europe and return your mainland back to indians.your democracy and freedom only belong to your white.\n\n \n Democracy and freedom belong to many people in the US and all around the world. It is not based on race at all. Freedom and democracy are universal terms not simply constrained by race. However if this is your logic and that of the people of China then it is no wonder that China is not a democracy or free.

Do we still consider them our Cold War enemy? Not at all.\n \n If China is our enemy then it is because they have opinions that differ from our own and those differences may one day lead to war. The main difference in opinion here is Taiwan.\n \n The EU and Russia are both powerful at this time and are not the enemies of the US.
