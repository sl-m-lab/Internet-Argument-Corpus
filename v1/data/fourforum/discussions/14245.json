   "Don't shoot: NRA bans guns from its annual meeting\n \"North Carolina State law prohibits the carrying of firearms in the Charlotte Convention Center, and the Time Warner Cable Arena,\" the sign outside the convention hall reads. \"In addition, the Rules and Regulations of the Charlotte Convention Center prohibit the carrying of firearms in the Center. Pursuant to Time Warner Cable Arena policy, all individuals entering the Arena will be subject to a magnetometer security check.\"\n \n Sound like the entryway into this years' Netroots Nation, a convention of liberal bloggers?\n \n Well, it isn't: it's the sign outside the door to the convention for the country's largest gun rights organization, the NRA.\n \n While the National Rifle Association is pushing for looser rules governing concealed weapons, they've agreed to restrictions opposing to the weapons appearing on their own convention floor. The national gun lobby held their event in Charlotte, NC this past weekend.\n\n Don't shoot: NRA bans guns from its annual meeting | Raw Story\n \n The IDEA! The NRA should be pistol-whipped!",
