   "(Concord, New Hampshire) Supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage filled a New Hampshire Senate hearing room Wednesday as the Senate Judiciary Committee began hearings on marriage equality legislation.\n \n Nearly 500 people showed up for the hearing, with crowds spilling out into a hallway.\n \n Among the speakers in favor of the bill was Gene Robinson, the openly gay Episcopal Bishop of New Hampshire.\n \n Robinson urged senators to support the bill and not fear political consequences from opponents of gay marriage.\n \n \"I know and understand that some of you are worried about your next election, fearing that your doing the right thing now will cost you. But not doing the right thing will also cost you, not just in the next election but also in your soul's self respect,\" he said.\n \n Roman Catholic Bishop John McCormack, in a written statement to the committee said that marriage can only be entered into by a man and a woman.\n \n \"Marriage is not simply a matter of emotional intimacy between two people, a lifestyle choice, or a purely, private relationship protected by the state. Civil society benefits from a stable marital order.\"\n \n Crowds began arriving at the Legislature early Wednesday morning, splitting into two camps - those for and those against same-sex marriage.\n \n \"Civil rights,\" said Tom Keeler, a Concord gay activist, speaking through a bullhorn. \"That's all there is to this. There is a minority being oppressed by a majority.\"\n \n At one point, an opponent of gay marriage tried to block the megaphone.\n \n Several minor skirmishes were also reported.\n \n The bill narrowly passed the state House last month. Gov. John Lynch (D) has said that he opposes gay marriage and believes the civil union law is fine. Two years ago, the Legislature approved, and Lynch signed, the civil unions bill.\n \n Some 600 same-sex civil unions have been conducted in the state. But same-sex couples have complained the law has created two separate forms of unions resulting in discrimination.\n \n Although Lynch opposes the marriage bill, he has skirted question over whether he would veto the bill.\n \n The Senate committee is eventually expected to approved the bill and send it to the Senate floor for a vote. Its future there, however is less certain.",
