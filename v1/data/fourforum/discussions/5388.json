   "I'd say that Condi would get a better chance of the 'black vote' because most black families tend to be a little more socially conservative than white democrats. With some of the antics lately, they may see it as a decent chance to get an actual role model. \n Being black and a female won't win her the election but, some people would vote for her 'just because' she was.\n So, the 'conservatives' would lose those who don't wants a woman or a black.\n And democrats might lose those who'd want to shake things up. \n It'd actually be in democrats best interest to vote Condi. That way, it'd acclimate most people to the concept that a woman AND a black could be a US president, later, they evolve that idea to a black/latino woman can be a president who is an extreme liberal.\n \n Some may see her and try to lable her as a 'sell out' others may be more pragmatic and actually think that the republicans actually are willing to select someone on merit rather than a 'hand-me-out' type of program. (Although, I wouldn't doubt both sides do that, it just seems that democrates are more overt and obvious about it.)\n \n I'd vote (several times, as is the traditional way) for Condi ATM over Hillery, and I'd have voted for Hillery over the likes of Kerry.",

   "Guiliani cannot be ruled out although I think it is highly unlikely. At this point I think McCain is in the catbird's seat. BTW, there is no reason he cannot go outside his party to grab Liberman as his VP, even if he is a Democrat. Lieberman is very popular among many Republicans including this Republican. McCain is a maverick but he will be formidable. He is an expert on foreign policy as is Lieberman although the Dumbocrats are too stupid realize he would have been their strongest candidate. \n \n Hillary would top out about 45% or so. Getting that other 5% would be exceedingly tough. If she should not get enough of the black vote she loses and then it is President McCain. \n \n BTW, I haven't heard anyone argue with my list. In any event, I positively, absolutely, unequivocally can state that my list is complete. The next president will come from that list. Anyone interested in the American presidential race should avail themselves of the time to study this list and make your choice.\n\n \n McCain is a good choice, it's a shame Republicans weren't smart enough to nominate him in 2000. As for the future of the party in 2008, I'd say a lot depends on the conditions in Iraq and our economic health when the time comes. The multi-billion dollar advertising campaign aimed at promoting democracy in the Middle East using American troops will only captivate the voting public for so long. A recent poll on CBS reinforces that the majority of Americans don't think Bush shares the same priorities as they do regarding the economy, social security, and the war in Iraq. I know, I know, you don't think much of CBS, find another poll to dispute the findings.\n http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/05/25/opinion/polls/main697825.shtml",

   "I notice you took the sweet time of typing out all the republicans' titles.\n \n \n Cheney would lose in a landslide, unless he was running against Hillary.\n Besides, he wouldn't take the nomination even if it were offered.\n I may be wrong about that, but he hates the spotlight.\n I think he would be content sitting on his darkened sail barge eating live frogs in brandy (it's a jabba the hutt reference).\n \n It's funny. I don't know if Dems actually want Hillary to run in 2008, but I don't think they realize that her nomination would ensure another Republican victory.\n \n If those two end up running against each other, Allah help us!!\n\n \n I hadn't noticed that but you are right. But it wasn't for the reason you thought. I wasn't sure that people outside (or even inside) this country would know who I was talking about. Most people had heard of the Democratic candidates. Notice that I didn't put the titles to Blunt or Jindal. I wanted them to do some of the investigative work themselves.\n \n Sorry, if I gave you the impression I was being biased. (I am of course) But I was mostly concerned about laying out the names and arguments why my list is complete and who I believe will be the candidates. I notice that Warner has gone to Europe to rub elbows with the movers and shakers over there. Watch him -- very closely. \n \n Hillary can win it. Cheney can win it. Neither one will lose in a \"landslide.\" Right now, I would say it would be about a 52-48% election. If the economy tanks then Hillary by 55%. If the economy is going great guns and the war in Iraq has essentially ended, then Cheney by 53-54%. Inevitably the party regulars come back home as they always do. I've been following politics since 1948. There is really nothing new under the sun.",
