   "Forgiveness and interpretation are key concepts in a religious philosopher's book of excuses.\n \n By interpreting religious doctrine in a favourable way and seeking forgiveness when doctrine is breached, followers are able engage in virtually any type of socially unacceptable behaviour, guilt free, and ensure their passage to the heavens is assured. Indeed, their path to righteousness can even involve violence against others.\n \n Because gods are VERY understanding, the inherently weak followers of various religions have come to the realisation that forgiveness is just a natural course of events when they commit a sin (if a rule is actually interpreted to apply!). Therefore, religion can easily be used to support immoral behaviour. emoticon_xangel",

   "It can indeed. However in the defence of religion (not something I often do!) this is just a way around the laws of religion, a opportunity to manipulate it. It is not accurate to say that religion promotes the behaviour, rather that it allows loopholes to circumvent it's own rules.",

   "Most of the well-known religions teach morality, believe it or not. It&#8217;s the individual (or groups) that promote immorality. It&#8217;s akin to the bad-gun confusion. The Golden Rule is taught through almost all religions, even the Native Americans.\n Celtic Faith\n Three things from which never to be moved: \n One's Oaths, One's Gods, and the Truth. \n The three highest causes of the true human are: \n Truth, Honor, and Duty. \n Three candles that illuminate every darkness: \n Truth, Nature, and Knowledge.\n And Honor above all! \n Wiccan Faith\n An it harm none, do as thou will. Wiccan Rede\n Christian Faith\n Whatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them. Matthew 7.12 \n Confucianism\n Try your best to treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself, and you will find that this is the shortest way to benevolence. Mencius VII.A.4\n Muslim Faith\n Not one of you is a believer until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself. Islam. Forty Hadith of an-Nawawi 13\n Buddhist Faith\n Hurt not others with that which pains yourself. Udana-Varga \n Zoroastrian Faith\n Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others. Shayast-na-Shayast 13:29\n Hindu Faith\n This is the sum of duty: do naught to others which if done to thee would cause thee pain. The Mahabharata\n Native American\n Respect for all life is the foundation. The Great Law of Peace\n Jainism\n A man should wander about treating all creatures as he himself would be treated. Sutrakritanga 1.11.33\n African Traditional Religions\n One going to take a pointed stick to pinch a baby bird should first try it on himself to feel how it hurts. Yoruba Proverb (Nigeria)\n Jewish Faith\n What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow men. That is the entire Law; all the rest is commentary. The Talmud\n Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith\n And if thine eyes be turned towards justice, choose thou for thy neighbour that which thou choosest for thyself. Epistle to the Son of the Wolf\n Pittacus, 650 BCE &#8211; Do not to your neighbor what you would take ill from him.\n Thales, 464 BCE &#8211; Avoid doing what you would blame others for doing.\n Sextus (Pythagorean), 406 BCE &#8211; What you wish your neighbors to be to you, be also to them.\n Aristotle, 384 BCE &#8211; We should conduct ourselves toward others as we would have them act toward us.\n Aristippus of Cyrene, 365 BCE &#8211; Cherish reciprocal benevolence, which will make you as anxious for another's welfare as your own.\n Isocrates, 338 BCE &#8211; Act toward others as you desire them to act toward you.\n Hinduism, 300 BCE &#8211; This is the sum of duty: Do naught unto others which would cause you pain if done to you. - \n To name a few.\n \n I will say that immoral behavior hides behind religion, however, and even reaches into its scriptures to justify it. I also find a substantial amount of people, who desire to find the truth in religion, soon become bogged down in it, mostly because they are unwilling to go that extra step &#8211; to rid themselves of ego. Sometimes it manifests in anger and total disappointment, opening them up for &#8220;enlightenment&#8221; to the point they claim there is no God or Supreme Being and that we are all alone. That is where religion, by proxy, causes violence and immorality, IMO. I am not saying that the unreligious are rogues and knaves &#8211; far from it. It amounts to those that pervert a religion or a specific religious teaching that I am referring to.",

   "I don't have much doubt that the rules of various religions are extensive and absolute and that some of the failings in religion can be attributed to the people that \"follow\" these rules. However, even if we assume everyone could follow these rules to the letter, you would still have to question the morality of some of the doctrines that were formulated so long ago.\n \n For example, there are various quotes from christian scriptures referring to justified acts of murder, smiting etc. If there is disagreement on this, I'm sure I can list a few. By todays standards, these are not justified penalties or punishments for failure to comply to an ancient code. These are simply suggestions that immoral behaviour can be accepted in various circumstances, even when it contradicts teachings from the same school of thought. Whether it is the failing of an individual or not in this case is largely irrelevant, since it is in the framework of their documented belief system.\n \n Having said that, a religion is more than a set of written commandments. It is the way a collective group manages their belief and subculture. Accepting immoral behaviour in their ranks without taking action or expelling members, is effectively promoting these activities.",
