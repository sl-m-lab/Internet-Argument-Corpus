They either refuse to hear them, or they use some technicality to rule in the case without ruling on the issue at hand.\n \n This is not new, look at the Miller case. This is the case that should have answered once and for all whether gun control is legal or not. Instead, tehy ruled that a sawed off shotgun may or may not be legal, depending on whether or not it was militarily useful.\n \n To me, this is a pretty big indicator that the system has broken down. The supreme court is supposed to be the last word, the last defense of the American people against a tyranical government. Instead of playing this roll as was intended, the carefully screened justices do what they were meant to do, make decisions based on politics, preferably without rocking the boat too much.",
