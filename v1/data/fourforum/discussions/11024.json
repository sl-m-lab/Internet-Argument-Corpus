In the 3096 (BC) Olympics, it was the Woodhenge Willers over the Durrington Wallers in that infamous Sudden Death Match overtime thriller. 1-0 final score. In the Women's Archery competition, it was the Willers over the Wallers also, following their Men's Archery competition victory. Willers' Olympic Men's and Women's Teams dominated the 3096 (BC) Games and were so popular after those Olympics that even the River Wylye (one of eight rivers draining the area) was renamed (previously called Warriors River).\n \n The Sudden Death of 'the body from the ditch' (Stonehenge discovery of 1978) caused by multiple Arrow Wounds in the back, said body on display at Salisbury Museum, sadly occurred during the 2300 (BC) Olympic Games' Women's Archery competition at Stonehenge Amphitheatre. Archery Judge Wallers Willers' (known as Backside Bullseye here at State Press) untimely death, referred to as a Stonehenge Sentinel Skeleton (SSS) by Dennis Price, archaeologist (Stonehenge expert) and described in This Is Wiltshire Network (Gazette & Herald, 7 March 2008), unfortunately occurred at said Amphitheatre when Archery Judge Wallers Willers (SSS) made an untimely movement from behind the Judge Honor's guard (target Game shield) causing His Sudden Death.\n \n Later the town of Wilton and county of Wiltshire adopted their names in their Honor.\n \n 360 feet - Stonehenge Amphitheatre latrine (Ditch) diameter\n 320 feet - Stonehenge Amphitheatre bleachers (Bank) diameter\n 285 feet - Stonehenge Amphitheatre fence (Aubrey Holes) diameter\n \n The interior is Anciently perfect in size.\n \n 3100-2600 BC - Stonehenge Olympic Games field - No stones\n \n (SOS) Stonehenge Olympic Sports:\n \n Archery, Athletics (track and field), Ancient badminton*, Ancient baseball, Boxing, Fencing, Ancient field hockey, Football (soccer), Ancient pentathlon*, Ancient softball, Wilto, Wiltwondo, Ancient tennis, Volleyball, Weightlifting (rocklifting), and Wrestling.\n \n *Note: 3000 BC - Wooden structures added for Ancient gymnastics; Uneven bars, Balance beam, Salisbury floor exercise, and Vault (for Women), and High bar and Parallel bars, Salisbury floor exercise, Vault, and Pommel horse** (for Men).\n \n **It evolved from exercises used by Homo erectus and Neanderthal, including skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and various performance skills.\n \n 2600 BC - Olympic Games' first Rock (Bluestone) Trophies awarded.\n \n Salisbury Museum \"the body from the ditch\" Exhibit\n The \"Stonehenge Sentinel Skeleton\" SSS Theory\n \n Was the SSS's name The Right Honourable Archery Judge Wallers Willers who got killed in that tragic Target Archery accident, or was the SSS's name The Right Honourable Archery Judge Willers Wallers who got killed in that tragic Target Archery accident?\n \n Stonehenge Archery's deceased Field Target Archery Judge's last name must have been Willers, not Wallers, because Wiltshire would be called Waltshire if it was, which of course it is not. Likewise, Stonehenge Archery's deceased Field Target Archery Judge's first name must have been Wallers, not Willers, because Wiltshire would be called Waltshire if it was, which it is not. Us here at State Press who have investigated this matter, therefore, are going with \"Stonehenge Archery Judge Wallers Willers\", not \"Stonehenge Archery Judge Willers Wallers\", unless you have a better foundation of historical information at your disposal than any of us.\n \n Here is how it will be printed with His name unreleased: \"UK, Wiltshire, Salisbury Museum exhibit 'the body from the ditch' SKELETON was a Stonehenge Archery Judge who inspected an Archery Field Target at Stonehenge prematurely, a volley of Archers' Arrows accidently causing His death from behind.\" And here is how it will be printed with His name released: \"UK, Wiltshire, Salisbury Museum exhibit 'the body from the ditch' SKELETON was Stonehenge Archery Judge Wallers Willers, deceased, who inspected an Archery Field Target at Stonehenge prematurely, a volley of Archers' Arrows accidently causing His death from behind.\"\n \n Sentinel: Middle French sentinelle, from Old Italian sentinella, from sentina vigilance, from sentire to perceive, from Latin, year 1579, an Archery Judge is a Sentinel of Archery, vigilant and perceptive.

   "Stonehenge Building Materials:\n \n For those unfamiliar with the 5 basic rock types at Stonehenge;\n here is a list of them in chronological order of their first arrival.\n \n 85 MYA\n \n White Chalk - The outcrop sedimentary rock of Stonehenge is Late Cretaceous Period, Santonian Age, calcium carbonate. Late Cretaceous Period outcrop sedimentary rock is the in situ construction material used by the Stonehenge builders. This material is approximately 85 million years old. This stone is called Seaford Chalk Formation rock. White in color, this building material is from Stonehenge Ditch Mining area.\n \n 3100 BC\n \n Whitestone - The oldest limestone sedimentary rock of Stonehenge is Early Carboniferous (Mississippian) Period, Arundian Age, calcium carbonate. Early Carboniferous Period limestone sedimentary rock is the first (1st) construction material imported by the Stonehenge builders. This material is approximately 340 million years old. This stone is called High Tor (Birnbeck) Limestone Formation rock. White in color, this building material is from South Wales Coalfield area.\n \n 3000 BC\n \n Cosheston - The oldest sandstone sedimentary rock of Stonehenge is Devonian Period micaceous silicate. Devonian Period sandstone sedimentary rock is the second (2nd) construction material imported by the Stonehenge builders. This material is approximately 408 million years old. This stone is called Senni Beds (Old Red Sandstone) Formation rock. Green in color, this building material is from South Wales Coalfield area.\n \n 2600 BC\n \n Bluestone - The volcanic rock (oldest geologically) of Stonehenge is Ordovician Period intrusive igneous diabase (dolerite) and extrusive igneous felsite (rhyolite) and tuff (basic). Ordovician Period igneous rock is the third (3rd) construction material imported by the Stonehenge builders. This material is approximately 470 million years old. This stone is called Ordovician Volcanic rock. Black in color, this building material is from South Wales Coalfield area.\n \n 2200 BC\n \n Sarsen - The youngest sandstone sedimentary rock of Stonehenge is Oligocene-Miocene (Tertiary) Period silicate. Oligocene-Miocene Period sandstone sedimentary rock is the fourth (4th) construction material imported by the Stonehenge builders. This material is approximately 24 million years old. This stone is called Reading Formation rock. Gray in color, this building material is from Marlborough Downs Mining area.\n \n Note that this order is consistent with both rock transport theories;\n rock transported by a glacier and rock transported by the Ancient.\n \n Both! One twice! Hope this helps!\n \n http://www.open2.net/forum/showthread.php?p=22421#post22421\n http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/mbhistory/F2233812?thread=5312359\n \n The Ancient!\n \n Garry W.

The drifting of snow behind Denke's Stonehenge Snow Fence followed the laws of physics as the pressure on the downwind side was less than that on the windward side, which allowed the light material snow (and Luau leaves) to settle there.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_fence\n \n Garry W.

The palisade is an open structure which would not have been defensive and was too high to be practical for controlling livestock. It certainly wasn't for hunting herded animals and so, like everything else in this ceremonial landscape, we have to believe it must have had a religious significance. The most plausible explanation is that it was built at huge cost to the community to screen the environs of Stonehenge from view. Basically, we think it was to keep the lower classes from seeing what exactly their rulers and the priestly class were doing.\"\n \n http://www.snowfence.com/images/gallery/customs/002_custom_BP-Alaska.jpg\n \n Mike Pitts, editor of British Archaeology Magazine and author of the book Hengeworld, said: \"This is a fantastic insight into what the landscape would have looked like. This huge wooden palisade would have snaked across the landscape, blotting out views to Stonehenge from one side. The other side was the ceremonial route to the Henge from the River Avon and would have been shielded by the contours. The palisade would have heightened the mystery of whatever ceremonies were performed and it would have endowed those who were privy to those secrets with more power and prestige.
