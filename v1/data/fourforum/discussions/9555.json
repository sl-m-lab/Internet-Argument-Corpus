   "The answer to your question is no, Congress is not shredding the Constitution. A lot of scaremongering has been going on over this, but when you get all the facts you realize that it's baseless. The scenario that is generally being presented is that if you have a blog, mention politics, and have over 500 readers, then you have to jump through a bunch of beurocratic hoops or be fined/jailed. The article linked would like you to believe that \"Section 220 defining individuals or organizations reaching more than 500 people on a grassroots level with information about political issues as lobbying organizations, if the information can be construed as urging people to contact congress.\" This simply isn't the case. The bill is targeted towards \"astroturfers\", groups pretending to be grass root organizations, but that are actually fronts for big money. How do you tell the difference? Under this bill you would only need to file reports if you spent or received more than $25,000 a quarter for your efforts. To my mind, if someone is paying you $100,000 a year to push a political policy, then classifying you as a lobbyist is quite reasonable, and having you fill out the appropriate paper work is hardly onerous.",

The bill defines \"paid efforts to stimulate grassroots lobbying\" as any paid attempt in support of lobbying contacts on behalf of a client to influence the general public or segments thereof to contact one or more covered legislative or executive branch officials (or Congress as a whole) to urge such officials (or Congress) to take specific action with respect to specific issues or proposals, as defined under the LDA.",
