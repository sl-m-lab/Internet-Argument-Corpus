   "Do you support denying at least some felons the right to own firearms? Do you support NICS to identify those felons?\n\n \n If a person is on parole they're subject to numerous restrictions on what they can do or where they can go. One of these restrictions tends to be not buying any alcoholic beverages. If they do and get caught then it's a violation of their parole and they go right back to prison.\n \n Despite the fact that it's 100% illegal for a felon to purchase or possess a firearm, they still manage to get armed, and we have no way of finding out their sources, or how many sources there are for them to choose from. I believe that in barring them from the legal venues, we've regulated their ability to be tracked beyond our boundaries. The more we're faced with these issues I think it would be easier to remove the prohibition against purchase, and then bust them for the possession in a sting operation. That way we can catch them in the act, just like we would somebody violating their parole by buying a six pack or paying for a hooker.\n \n We know who the criminals are, but we don't know who their dealers are. So I say we set up a trap to catch them in an easy to access venue that can actually be located and observed. And that way they can't argue entrapment.\n \n \nI simply explained how the law permits your own children to access the family arsenal. Ignorance of the law is what played a part. What do they say about that?\n\n \n \"Ignorance of the law is no excuse\" only applies in a situation in which somebody is trying to claim they didn't know that they were breaking the law. The standard doesn't apply in this case where the man was unaware that the law was designed only to prevent neighbor kids from killing themselves after they might break into his house when he's not away.\n \n Had the attack occurred in a state without unconstitutional (as per the McDonald ruling, which extended Heller to all 50 states) mandatory storage laws, then the daughter could've armed herself, shot the intruder, and possibly saved her siblings from being senselessly murdered.\n \n \nThis is not CA law which is what we were discussing.\n\n \n Mandatory theft reporting laws aren't in effect in California? Surely you jest.\n \n \nWrong again. If you mean \"documentation\" as in the FFL keeps record of the parties to the transaction, then yes.

What was that about no conspiracies?\n\n \n California forbids the sale of any handgun that isn't on their \"safe handgun roster\". One of the qualifications for a model to be on this roster is for the manufacturer to pay a yearly price for each model they want to sell in the state, and if they choose to stop paying the extortion fee, the model will be considered \"unsafe\" and banned from any future sales. This is nothing more than plain and simple extortion, anyone can understand that. Why you choose to consider it otherwise is beyond logic. In principal it's no different than paying the local gangs a certain amount to keep them from coming in and trashing your business.",

To be fair though I'd say the pro-gunners ON THIS FORUM are by far the biggest frauds on this forum easily surpassing the \"gay rights\" and \"evolution/creation\" forums. I've honestly spent very little time, up until the past few months, on this forum because it didn't strike me as really debatable issue. Clearly the pro gun rights folks have the advantage and the debate should be easily won.  However, you got folks here who make just idiotic arguments which makes pro-gun folks look bad. Seeing as how I support almost all gun rights laws I find it necessary to call these people out. \n \n So you can slap around Galileo all day but the pro-gunners on this forum are totally warped. \n \n Now, as for just regular people debating it, I think it varies. Your analysis of the NRA is dead on but like most hot issues both sides have liars. I think in general the people that support 2nd amendments rights but are not as vocal are probably pretty smart about it. This has been my experience at least.\n\n \n \n Therein lies the problem with extremists. Even when they are right, they sound like raving lunatics. When they are wrong they are even worse. \n \n I used to like the gun control forum primarily as a form of mental masturbation.

No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n  What did they find?  \n &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n\n They did suggest more studies.

   "Sinjin. Without responding to your points individually, allow me to address them as a whole. I generally find you to be a truthful person who says what he means. And you have taken it on the chin for what I consider your anti-gun beliefs. \n \n You made the statement that if anyone disagree with me about anything, that I would consider that person Anti-gun. You know that isn't true. That statement is ridiculous! And how many times have you chastised me for bringing up your name in the past? That was deceptive. \n \n It is not that weather or not we believe that some regulation is acceptable on a Fundamental, Constitutionally Recognized as Inalienable, Right. That train left the station long ago! The ship has sailed! \n \n We now have 22 to 30 thousand gun laws, a Federal Agency that watches over the transfer of firearms, A list of Federal Laws with a minimum of 5 years in jail, and law abiding people who have to get a background check when we purchase a gun from a gun licensed gun dealer! We have the 2 studies saying that &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n \n Given these facts, what most of us object to is your insistence that, even with all of this, it is not enough controls on a Right that has been adjudicated as Individual and Fundamental! The standard for Constitutional Rights is the law must be minimal and then specifically tailored to serve the purpose. I think 22 to 30 thousand is excessive, and the Federal Government even lacked the granted power to make them! But yet, you don't hear us calling for the repeal of them! I say that we are being reasonable, good citizens. \n \n I told you before that I hoped the Supreme Court rulings would have changed your mind, and the rest of the Anti-gunners minds! But Nope! It appears that I held most of you up to a standard that was not warranted! \n \n You still have a pretty substantial list of more laws you want imposed on the good and law abiding people of America, that list pretty much follows California, and the anti-gun orgs list of more laws they want too! So pardon me if we draw conclusions. If it walks like a duck, and all. \n \n Since the 2nd Amendment applies to the States and local governments as well as the Federal Government, why should we just allow you force your ideas, of suits your sensibilities, on the rest of the country? Why aren't we, instead, looking at Alaska or Texas, or some other state for guidance, as to what your Nation's gun laws should be? Why are you so special? Why is it the only views we are to take into considerations if the Anti-gun view? \n \n So we are at an impasse. You will call for more and more, and I will remind everyone this is a Fundamental, Constitutionally recognized as Inalienable, Right, and I how think that you, and those who agree with you, are being piggish, and not respecting the Constitution!\n \n This is the battle of ideas we are locked into!

The Anti Federalist did not trust any government, even the one they were in the process of making. \n \n (From our National Archives)   The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution \n Alexander Hamilton 1775\n The Sacred Rights of Mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchment,. or musty records. They are written with a sun beam in whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself, and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power. \n \n Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right to a fair and speedy trial&#8211;the ringing phrases that inventory some of Americans' most treasured personal freedoms&#8211;were not initially part of the U.S. Constitution. At the Constitutional Convention, the proposal to include a bill of rights was considered and defeated. The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution as the first ten amendments on December 15, 1791.\n \n The fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process. To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable. Throughout the ratification process, individuals and state ratification conventions called for the adoption of a bill of rights\n\n There followed the debate about the addition of a Bill of Rights. \n \n Hamilton felt,  Alexander Hamilton-- Federalist Papers no. 84 \n I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution,  but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power.\"\n\n \n Hence the final wording of the 9th and the 10th Amendment \n   9th Amendment \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. \n \n Rights Retained by the People \n \n Annotations \n \n Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those.Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives. ''It has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.'' 2 It is clear from its text and from Madison's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction, making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated, and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement. 3 Recently, however, the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions. \n\n  10th Amendment \n The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n \n Regardless of your attempts to cove up error, and or how you chose to spin it, Steve the 9th amendment is NOT, nor has it anything to do with States Rights.",

Fine, no one denies this. This has nothing to do with what rights exist and what the constitution says about who can recognize them. Not only that but it doesn't explain the original meaning behind any of the amendments. I'm not sure how this is relevant to the debate or anything more than a red herring.\n \n Your second quote is also Alexander Hamilton and from Fed 84 which talks about the BoR. The quote only talks about why the BoR would be dangerous to include in the constitution. Again, not really building on any case here. In fact, Alexander Hamilton wrote in Fed 32 \"state governments would clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had, and which were not by [the Constitution] exclusively delegated to the United States\". The states before had a lot of power and as we see here Alexander Hamilton suggested the only power relinquished was those expressly states.\n \n The only relevant your quote has is for why the 9th and 10th amendments were created. \n \n You then post the 9th and 10th amendments as if that changes anything.\n \n But in reality the 9th amendment and the 10th amendment were similar in nature and both related to federalism as well as rights for the people. The 9th amendment was created to help preserve states rights though. In fact, Madison, who wrote it, even said so:\n \n \nMadison then sums up his argument in a manner that establishes, without any further question, that the purpose of the Ninth Amendment was to protect the rights of the states:\n In fine, if the power were in the constitution, the immediate exercise of it cannot be essential-if not there, the exercise of it involves the guilt of usurpation, and establishes a precedent of interpretation, leveling all the barriers which limit the powers of the general government, and protect those of the state governments\nSSRN-The Lost Original Meaning of the Ninth Amendment by Kurt Lash\n The quote is from a newspaper covering Madison.\n \n Joseph Story is quoted as saying: \"\"every state remains at full liberty to legislate upon the subject of rights, preferences, contracts, and remedies, as it may please.\"\n \n I mean, it is right there. I quote constitutional scholars and you quote unrelated quotes from Hamilton. At least be honest with me...you know I have a good point.",

   "The Grey-Haired Brigade\n They like to refer to us as senior citizens, old fogies, geezers, and in some cases dinosaurs. Some of us are ?baby boomer? getting ready to retire. Others have been retired for some time. We walk a little slower these days and our eyes and hearing are not what they once were. We have worked hard, raised our children, worshiped our God and grown old together. Yes, we are the ones some refer to as being over the hill and that is probably true.\n But before writing us off completely, there are a few things that need to be taken into consideration. In school we studied English, history, math, and science which enabled us to lead America into the technological age. Most of us remember what outhouses were, many of us with firsthand experience. We remember the days of telephone party-lines, ten cent gasoline, and milk and ice being delivered to our homes. For those of you who don?t know what an icebox is, today they are electric and referred to as refrigerators. A few even remember when cars were started with a crank. Yes, we lived those days.\n We are probably considered old fashioned and out-dated by many. But there are a few things you need to remember before completely writing us off. We won World War II and fought in Korea and Viet Nam. We can quote the pledge of allegiance, and know where to place our hand while doing so. We wore the uniform of our country with pride and lost many friends on the battlefield. We didn?t fight for the Socialist States of America, we fought for the ?land of the free and home of the brave.? We wore different uniforms but carried the same flag. We know the words to the Star Spangle Banner, America, and America the Beautiful by heart, and you may even see some tears running down our cheeks as we sing. We have lived what many of you have only read about in history books and we feel no obligation to apologize to anyone for America.\n Yes, we are old and slow these days but rest assured, we have at least one good fight left in us. We have loved this country, fought for it, and died for it, and now we are going to save it. It is our country and nobody is going to take it away from us. We took oaths to defend America against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and that is an oath we plan to keep. There are those who want to destroy this land we love but, like our founders, there is no way we are going to remain silent. It was the young people of this nation who elected Obama and the Democratic congress. You fell for the ?hope and change? which in reality was nothing but ?hype and lies.? You have tasted socialism and seen evil face to face, and have found you don?t like it after all.\n You make a lot of noise but most are all too interested in their careers and ?climbing the social ladder? to be involved in such mundane things as patriotism and voting. It appears that we care more about our grandchildren than some care about their children. Many of those who fell for the ?great lie? in 2008 are now having buyer?s remorse. With all the education we gave you, you didn?t have sense enough to see through the lies and instead drank the Kool-aid. Now you?re paying the price and complaining about it. No jobs, lost mortgages, higher taxes, and less freedom. This is what you voted for and this is what you got. We entrusted you with the Torch of Liberty and you traded it for a paycheck and a fancy house.\n Well, don?t worry youngsters, the Grey Haired Brigade is here, and in two months we are going to take back our nation. We may drive a little slower than you would like but we get where we?re going, and in November we?re going to the polls by the millions. This land does not belong to the Muslim in the White House or to Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. It belongs to We the People, and We the People plan to reclaim our land and our freedom. We hope this time you will do a better job of preserving it and passing it along to our grandchildren.\n So the next time you have the chance to say the Pledge of Allegiance, stand up, put your hand over your heart, honor our country, and thank God for the old geezers of the Grey-Haired Brigade.\n \n ?The silver haired head is a crown of glory, if it is found in the way of righteousness\".

   "As to my sources, they are the Historians at our Nations Archives, the Legal Eagles over at Find law, and the Federalist Papers. \n \nI mean, it is right there. I quote constitutional scholars and you quote unrelated quotes from Hamilton. At least be honest with me...you know I have a good point.\n\n In today's day and time, it seems like we can get someone to say anything one wants. I'll grant you that you have one person who says that. \n \n However, a contract is a meeting of the minds. Our Constitution is a contract, with the BOR as a guarantor to our Rights. No BoR No Constitution! That was the way it was! \n \n Thinking of this, are you saying that the people who ratified the constitution knew that they were making 2 of the exact same amendments? 9 and 10. Does that make sense? If so why did they do it? \n \n Are you saying that We the People did not care about their Rights they were not being covered in the BOR? Are you saying that, as We the People read the BOR, they knew it meant something different than what we can see says today? If so what are your bases for that assumption? \n \n Are you saying that the Anti federalist were fine with not covering those rights not specifically covered by the BOR? \n \n Remembering these people had a Less than Zero compunction about pulling the trigger on government officials who scammed them, or usurped their rights, does this make sense? If it does not, then it is not true. \n \n Remembering that our Founders fought the most powerful army in the World in order to secure their, and our freedoms, we need to see everything in that vein. So does what people say, make sense. That is the correct view to understanding the Constitution! \n \n Bryan is a lawyer, I am waiting to see what he has to say about that.\n \n Findlaw has these cases as part of the annotation. The are personal rights adjudicated under the 9th Amendment, not states rights. Why?\n   The Ninth Amendment had been mentioned infrequently in decisions of the Supreme Court 4\n until it became the subject of some exegesis by several of the Justices in Griswold v. Connecticut. 5 There a statute prohibiting use of contraceptives was voided as an infringement of the right of marital privacy. Justice Douglas, writing the opinion of the Court, asserted that the ''specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.'' 6 Thus, while privacy is nowhere mentioned, it is one of the values served and protected by the First Amendment, through its protection of associational rights, and by the Third, the Fourth, and the Fifth Amendments as well. The Justice recurred to the text of the Ninth Amendment, apparently to support the thought that these penumbral rights are protected by one Amendment or a complex of Amendments despite the absence of a specific reference. Justice Goldberg, concurring, devoted several pages to the Amendment. \n \n [Footnote 2] 1 Annals of Congress 439 (1789). Earlier, Madison had written to Jefferson: ''My own opinion has always been in favor of a bill of rights; provided it be so framed as not to imply powers not meant to be included in the enumeration. . . . I have not viewed it in an important light--1. because I conceive that in a certain degree . . . the rights in question are reserved by the manner in which the federal powers are granted. 2. because there is great reason to fear that a positive declaration of some of the most essential rights could not be obtained in the requisite latitude. I am sure that the rights of conscience in particular, if submitted to public definition would be narrowed much more than they are likely ever to be by an assumed power.'' 5 Writings of James Madison, 271-72 (G. Hunt ed. 1904). See also 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 1898 (1833).\n \n [Footnote 3] To some extent, the Ninth and Tenth Amendments overlap with respect to the question of unenumerated powers, one of the two concerns expressed by Madison, more clearly in his letter to Jefferson but also present in his introductory speech. Supra, n.2 and accompanying text. \n \n [Footnote 4] In United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 94 -95 (1947), upholding the Hatch Act, the Court said: ''We accept appellant's contention that the nature of political rights reserved to the people by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments [is] involved. The right claimed as inviolate may be stated as the right of a citizen to act as a party official or worker to further his own political views. Thus we have a measure of interference by the Hatch Act and the Rules with what otherwise would be the freedom of the civil servant under the First, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments.'' See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 300 - 11 (1936), and Tennessee Electric Power Co. v. TVA, 306 U.S. 118, 143 -44 (1939). See also Justice Chase's opinion in Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 388 (1798), and Justice Miller for the Court in Loan XXX'n v. Topeka, 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 655, 662 -63 (1875). \n \n [Footnote 7] Id. at 488, 491, 492. Chief Justice Warren and Justice Brennan joined this opinion. Justices Harlan and White concurred id. at 499, 502, without alluding to the Ninth Amendment, but instead basing their conclusions on substantive due process, finding that the state statute ''violates basic values implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,'' (citing Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937)). Id. at 500. It would appear that the source of the fundamental rights to which Justices Douglas and Goldberg referred must be found in a concept of substantive due process, despite the former's express rejection of this ground. Id. at 481-82. Justices Black and Stewart dissented. Justice Black viewed the Ninth Amendment ground as essentially a variation of the due process argument under which Justices claimed the right to void legislation as irrational, unreasonable, or offensive, without finding any violation of an express constitutional provision. \n\n \n   Section C \n The State argues that the Constitution nowhere spells out a guarantee for the right of the public to attend trials, and that accordingly no such right is protected.  (Again Anarchy!) The possibility that such a contention could be made did not escape the notice of the Constitution's draftsmen; they were concerned that some important rights might be thought disparaged because not specifically guaranteed&#8230;..\n \n But arguments such as the State makes have not precluded recognition of important rights not enumerated. Notwithstanding the appropriate caution against reading into the Constitution rights not explicitly defined, the Court has acknowledged that certain unarticulated rights are implicit in enumerated guarantees. For example, the rights of association and of privacy, the right to be presumed innocent, and the right to be judged by a standard of proof beyond a reasonable [448 U.S. 555, 580] doubt in a criminal trial, as well as the right to travel, appear nowhere in the Constitution or Bill of Rights. Yet these important but unarticulated rights have nonetheless been found to share constitutional protection in common with explicit guarantees. 16 The concerns expressed by Madison and others have thus been resolved; fundamental rights, even though not expressly guaranteed, have been recognized by the Court as indispensable to the enjoyment of rights explicitly defined.\n",

   "Mayors&#039; gun tracing report: Latest sound bite for gun control - Charlotte gun rights | Examiner.com\n \n \nA cautionary tale of how phony facts about guns become \"what everybody knows...\" \n \n Michael Bloomberg's gun control group, \"Mayors Against Illegal Guns\" (MAIG), released a report yesterday entitled \"Trace the Guns: The Link Between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun Trafficking.\" Before I had even downloaded the report, I got an interview request from Loretta Boniti of News 14 Carolina.\n \n What I found in the report was nothing especially new, but rather a repackaged attempt to blame states with less restrictive gun laws (and lower crime rates) for crimes committed in states with more restrictive gun laws (and correspondingly higher crime rates).\n \n What follows is instructive to gun rights supporters in depicting how a report with the most basic flaws can become a \"factoid\" - those tidbits of \"truthiness\" that \"everybody knows.\"\n \n MAIG REPORT'S FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS\n \n Unsurprisingly, MAIG bases its claim that ten states supply the largest of proportion of \"interstate crime guns\" by using gun tracing reports from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - despite the fact that such reports have long been discredited as a statistical source.\n \n Says the Congressional Research Service:\n \n \"Trace requests are not accurate indicators of specified crimes...traces may be requested for a variety of reasons not necessarily related to criminal incidents.\"\n \n The reason, of course, is that not all guns used in crimes are traced, and that not all guns traced were used in crimes. Different law enforcement agencies have different policies on gun tracing, making the results useless for statistical analysis. I once had a firearm traced during a routine traffic stop. Is that a \"crime gun?\" Bloomberg would have you believe that it is.\n \n WHERE DID THE TRACE REPORTS COME FROM?\n \n I was curious to know from whence MAIG got the tracing data, since the Tiahrt Amendment, passed numerous times (most recently in 2009) as an amendment to federal appropriations bills, expressly prohibits BATFE from releasing trace data for purposes of statistical analysis precisely because it is flawed.\n \n Minneapolis Gun Rights Examiner John Pierce found the reason MAIG could get their hands on it: According to footnote 4 in the report: \"recent reforms to Congressional restrictions on the use of crime gun trace data\" allowed them access.\n \n Indeed, P.L. 111-117, as cited by Congressman Todd Tiarht's web site, does provide for release of \"statistical aggregate data\"by the BATFE. Whether \"aggregate\" data permit the level of interpretation MAIG applies remains to be seen, but apparently a loophole in the NRA-sanctioned amendment now enables groups such as MAIG to make claims based on flawed data.\n \n EVOLUTION OF A 'FACTOID'\n \n The MAIG report features all sorts of quasi-academic terms mixed with methodologically unsound conclusions. It tries to claim, for example, that certain types of gun laws (which, remarkably enough, coincide exactly with gun control advocates' wish lists) result in lower \"export rates.\" (Never mind that a basic tenet of statistics is that \"correlation does not imply causation.\" Simply because two things are associated does not mean one causes the other.)\n \n But one relatively new piece of fluff tries to claim that \"Time to Crime\" (\"TTC\") of two years or less - that is to say, the time from point of original sale to recovery from a crime - is an indicator of illegal gun trafficking.\n \n For example, North Carolina, says the report, has a recovery rate of guns with a \"short\" TTC of 22.9%. But what does this mean, exactly?\n \n Not much. It says that of the guns recovered in crimes which originated in North Carolina, 22.9% of them were sold less than two years prior to recovery, with the rest (77.1%) sold more than two years prior. Given that MAIG carefully omitted the actual number of guns recovered, the statistic is meaningless. If a measly 22 \"crime guns\" were recovered, for example, and 5 of them had a TTC of less than two years, that would be a rate of 22.9%.\n \n In the interest of propaganda, MAIG carefully avoids mentioning the total number of guns recovered which had short TTCs, but given that the TOTAL number of interstate crime guns recovered (with both short and long TTCs) was only 43,254, when divided by 50 states and then multiplied by 0.229, the number is probably quite small.\n \n A NEWS OUTLET BITES (AND RECANTS)\n \n But watch how meaningless statistics can morph into \"factoids\" that \"everybody knows.\"\n \n In the piece they aired with my interview, News 14 Carolina concluded the stats above mean, \"According to the report, 22.9 percent of all the guns sold in North Carolina have been recovered in crime within two years of the original sale.\"\n \n Percentage of guns recovered now becomes percentage of guns sold. This went out to tens of thousands of viewers across the state, as well as those who viewed the organization's web site. Similarly, the news org gleaned from the report that North Carolina ranked in the top ten exporters of so-called \"crime guns.\" Never mind that when factored for population, North Carolina drops to 20th in the country in \"crime guns\" exported per 100,000 inhabitants (a rate of 18.9), behind such crime gun dens of iniquity as Vermont (22.8).\n \n And never mind that North Carolina's supposed 22.9% \"short TTC\" rate is on par with the national average of 22.6% -- another fact overlooked in the news piece.\n \n To its credit, News 14 Carolina seems to have been duped by Mayor Bloomberg's carefully-designed propaganda. Once the error was pointed out to them, the pulled the story and issued the following correction both on its web site and on television during the same hours in which the original story appeared: (snip)\n \n\n \n Also see: Report shows Mayors Against (your) Guns desperation to be relevant - National gun rights | Examiner.com",

   "Bryan should be interested in this before he answers you.\n   Kurt Lash's Majoritarian Difficulty \n  I.\n The Antimajoritarianism of James Madison \n \n Yet Lash's majoritarianism requires him to think that James Madison chose wording for a constitutional amendment the public meaning of which protected a right of a majority in the states to govern over the minority. That's a problem.\n \n Earlier in the article \n Consider this amendment proposed by Roger Sherman while serving on the House Select Committee formed to draft a bill of rights, which begins: \"The people have certain natural rights which are retained by them when they enter into Society. . . .\" After listing some of these rights, it concludes with the following injunction: \"Of these rights therefore they Shall not be deprived by the Government of the united States.\"5\n \n Sherman's draft explicitly linked the concept of \"natural rights\" with that of rights \"retained\" by \"[t]he people.\" The examples of these rights that follow include the undeniably individual rights of conscience, acquiring property, and of pursuing happiness and safety, freedom of speech, writing and publishing. Sherman's identification of these individual natural rights was commonplace.6 Another example can be found in the first paragraph of another proposed list of amendments as inscribed in the Senate Legislative Journals on September 8, 1789: \"That there are certain natural rights, of which men, when they form a social compact, cannot deprive or divest their posterity, among which are the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.\"7\n \n Sherman's draft dramatically shows how those in Congress during the drafting process thought of natural rights. First, natural rights were individual, personal or private rights, as evidenced by the examples enumerated by Sherman. Second, at this level of generality, those who enter into social compacts cannot deprive or divest their posterity of these natural rights regardless of the powers they may delegate to government. They are, in other words, inalienable.\n \n II. The Antimajoritarianism of the Constitutional Convention\n Lash would have us believe that, immediately after this counter-majoritarian Constitution was adopted, the Federalist-dominated Congress would propose adding language to the Constitution the public meaning of which protected a constitutional right of majorities to rule in the states, the very sort of right they denied majorities at the national level. Not very likely.\n \n  III. The Antimajoritarianism of the Bill of Rights \n Now it may well be true that opponents of the Constitution were more majoritarian than were the framers and the Federalists, and that a bill of rights was promised as a way of mollify their objections. Primarily, however, a bill of rights was promised and proposed to assuage those in the middle who were moved by the antifederalists' objection that the Constitution lacked a bill of rights-those who were persuaded to support the Constitution by the Federalists' promise to adopt a Bill of Rights in the form of amendments after its adoption. \n \n These amendments were then drafted by antimajoritarian James Madison and approved by an antimajoritarian Federalist-dominated Congress. Providing express protections of individual rather than states rights would deliver on the Federalists' promise while avoiding, to the degree possible, undermining their fledgling new national government by the states. So it is not at all surprising that the Bill of Rights took on a decidedly individualist cast. \n \n Choosing language protecting individual private rights would satisfy the public's concerns about the absence of a bill of rights, reinforce the national character of \"the people\" to which the Preamble referred, without threatening the fledgling national government's power to reign in abusive state governments. Of course, the fact that a protection of individual rights would protect not only the rights of a minority against abuses by majority factions but also the rights of the majority against abuses by minority factions is a feature rather than a bug of protecting individual rights. \n",

It is spreading over here and star gazer is their chief cheerleader.\n \n By your standards, star gazer should be emulated and praised for his anti American stance and calls for more violence. There is more violence along the Southern border than in Afghanistan almost. Don't think whomever reads his posts are going to forget it despite his later acclimations and griping about his stance even though he may claim that he has since changed his mind when we get through cleaning up the violence and perpertrators. You have heard doctors telling folks \"you are what you eat\". The same goes for what you say. I can't beieve that star gazer has any interest in America except the very worst in any circumstance and that is one reason he praises gun grabbers and gun control. anyone like minded enjoys the same blessings I bestow on star gazer.

   "Easy question, easy answer. The gun grabbing anti Constitutionalists have been lying to the American people for decades and haven't stopped even since the lies have been denounced in the Heller and McDonald decisions.\n \n Like timex, they keep ticking along with the same old platitudes and cliches even though some are waking up to the enormity and magnitude of the scope of the decisions and what they really mean and stand for and are now mad for eating the mushroom food they so readily gobbled down and regurgitated freely as reality when it was all just a sham and literally theft of birthrights as well as from taxpayers by a \"few wealthy benefactors\" as it was put by one of the chief recipeints of largess. Now they are still trying to denounce their original claims in favor of less blantant prior claims they have even made on this board and copied for the record. Gun grabbing politicians are serving prison terms for felony convictions or forced from office to avoid being censored or impeached. They hate the GAO and NRA for the exposure of themselves and the truth. Former Speaker of the House, Dan Rostenkowski who rammed through many anti gun legislation on voice votes was also convicted and removed from office which seems to have become the norm rather than abberent behavior. The same hypocrites that would deny citizens their unalienable rights were found to have dreaded gun permits and carried themselves.\n \n There really is no comparison so it is an obvious answer and the rights of citizens are once again being made whole despite shenanigans which continue by snakes who have been beheaded and are still thrashing around angry at their loss of power and influence as well as being caught on the wrong side of the Constitution and the Court. Twice convicted felon, Mario Biaggi even served as head and/or chief instigator of the now Brady Campaign. Now we are being asked not to remember these conspiracies and rather recent comments by posters and politicians, some who are going to face the piper November 2nd. That is the debate and it keeps getting derailed in a dishonest way to avoid the headcount of dishonesty of the commie/progressive/socialist who would eliminate the BOR if they could. Each and every dirty scheme that is proposed and shot down is just more dishonesty and more of the same willing learned behavior. Once you tell a lie, it grows and requires more to cover up the first by denial then another lie. There is no question, the answer is obvious and there are plenty of foreign input trying to aid and abet those still active in the last free Republic on earth.",

   "Well here we go. You picked the right thread to chime in on! Which side of the debate is more dishonest?\n \n What you quoted when you made this argument was nothing more than showing the Militia commander that you have what was required by law for militia duty! Quarter mastering from the 1792 Militia Act. Nothing more! Stuff like this!\n   Militia Act of 1792, \n\n \n No, I didnt. I stated, and linked to evidence, that what I was talking about had NOTHING to do with the quartermaster, who was only responsible for property of the US government, but rather that the responsibility for conducting the firearm census generally fell to the Brigade inspector under article 10 of the Militia Act:\n \n \n\n X. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the brigade inspector, to attend the regimental and battalion meeting of the militia composing their several brigades, during the time of their being under arms, to inspect their arms, ammunition and accoutrements; superintend their exercise and maneuvres and introduce the system of military discipline before described, throughout the brigade, agreeable to law, and such orders as they shall from time to time receive from the commander in Chief of the State; to make returns to the adjutant general of the state at least once in every year, of the militia of the brigade to which he belongs, reporting therein the actual situation of the arms, accoutrement, and ammunition, of the several corps, and every other thing which, in his judgment, may relate to their government and general advancement of good order and military disciple; an adjutant general shall make a return of all militia of the state, to the Commander in Chief of the said state, and a duplicate of the same to the president of the United States.\n\n \n We also covered the fact that the first FEDERALLY ordered census of firearms (publicly owned and privately owned) was ordered by Henry Knox, the first secretary of war, and that the order was countersigned by the commander in chief of the militia, George Washington. We also discussed the fact that Henry Dearborn, secretary of war under Jefferson, ordered a more extensive count in 1803, which included people going door to door and asking about firearms in the house, and that order was countersigned by THomas Jefferson. There was also a firearms census during Madisons presidency. \n \n Those were just the FEDERAL firearms counts. Most states had their brigade inspector do a census of their brigade (public and privately owned arms) EVERY year and turn in the results.\n \n That was my argument. Your argument was that such a thing is clearly unconstitutional because it might someday lead to confiscation of firearms. \n \n Granted, that was not dishonesty on your part, just plain old fashioned foolishness and an apparent inability to apply logical thought processes to an argument. Any reasonable person would recognize that the militia was the national military of the time and that it is only logical that the government would need to know how they were armed. It requires an almost incredible amount of naivety to believe that they would not be conducting relatively frequent firearms counts. They need to know what they can bring to bear if TSHTF.\n \n Unfortunately you could not seem to grasp the fact that what the government might or might not do in the future has no bearing on the constitutionality of a proposed law/executive order today (since, as I pointed out, there has never been a law on the books in the US requiring a firearms census, it was always simply done with an executive order, the president being the commander of the militia).",

GW would not have approved since the war he was fighting was over this very subject.\n\n \n WRONG. GWs signature was required for Henery Knox to order the count. While the president was not in direct control over the militia unless they had been federalized, he was still allowed to require reports and records from the militias. This was actually tested in the supreme court during his second term and the court found (and correctly I think) that a person would have to be borderline retarded to expect the president to be able to command a militia in an emergency when he does not have any idea how many there are, where they are, or how they are armed. \n \n \nThere is State Guards also not under the command of the president but the A.G. and the Governor. I have never seen them conduct any such nonesense in my life. ...neither have you.\n\n \n Nope. Sure have not. Mostly because the miltia model is dead. However, they could, it would not be unconstitutional, and it would be 100% legal. The practice is well founded in the nations history. I would hope that if we WERE still using the milita model for defense, where citizens are expected to provide weapons for the defense of their country, that SOMEBODY today would be smart enough to wonder exactly how many were available and where they are. \n \n \nThere is also the unorganized militia. They have never been \"audited\" neither and never would submit.

That is the law!!!\n\n \n Except they DID submit under Jefferson and Madison both. I guess they thought that the defense of the nation was more important than nonsensical posturing. \n \n When I call it a \"firearms census\" I am using census in its traditional form, which refers to a property assessment of citizens. It has nothing to do with the constitutional requirement for a census (which is in Article 1, section 2). \n \n That said, there is nothing at all in the constitution that limits what questions they may ask. There is a list of questions they are REQUIRED to ask, but no limit on what they MAY ask. In the census of 1810 questions about the quantity and values of good produced by the respondent were asked. Keep in mind that most of our nations founders were still serving in congress in 1810...except for the one in the white house. Are you saying they did not properly understand the document THEY WROTE AND RATIFIED but you do? That seems to be the \"argument\" (though I hesitate to call it that since it seems to be more of a \"because I said so\" rant) when it comes to firearm counts in early America. All the founding fathers who were ordering them just didnt understand the document they had developed and ratified.",

However, they could, it would not be unconstitutional, and it would be 100% legal. The practice is well founded in the nations history. I would hope that if we WERE still using the milita model for defense, where citizens are expected to provide weapons for the defense of their country, that SOMEBODY today would be smart enough to wonder exactly how many were available and where they are. \n \n \n Many States have one, Texas does, Alaska does etc. Check STATE GUARD ASSNS. OF THE U.S.\n \n \nExcept they DID submit under Jefferson and Madison both. I guess they thought that the defense of the nation was more important than nonsensical posturing.\n\n \n So you don't have anything more than a 'guess'. \n \n \nWhen I call it a \"firearms census\" I am using census in its traditional form, which refers to a property assessment of citizens. It has nothing to do with the constitutional requirement for a census (which is in Article 1, section 2).\n\n \n Folks then were well aware of the purpose of the census and the reason is found in the act itself. There never was a reason for \"property assessment\" appllicable to firearms nor personal belongings. \n \n \nThat said, there is nothing at all in the constitution that limits what questions they may ask.[ There is a list of questions they are REQUIRED to ask, but no limit on what they MAY ask.\n\n \n You never bothered to read Article 2 of the XIVth Amendment did you?\n \n \nIn the census of 1810 questions about the quantity and values of good produced by the respondent were asked. Keep in mind that most of our nations founders were still serving in congress in 1810...except for the one in the white house. Are you saying they did not properly understand the document THEY WROTE AND RATIFIED but you do? That seems to be the \"argument\" (though I hesitate to call it that since it seems to be more of a \"because I said so\" rant) when it comes to firearm counts in early America.

   "How is my claim an \"outrageous lie\"? Cause you say it's extortion? Please.\n\n \n We've been over this before, many times in fact. If a firearms manufacturer wants to sell its products in California they're required to pay a fee to the state for each model they want to sell. The fee is $200 a year, for the duration of the time the model is either in continuous production, or until the company decides to stop selling it in California. \n \n California charges the same fee for different models even when the only difference is the type of finish -be it blued, stainless steel or parkerized- even if the insides are exactly the same and one has already been approved.\n \n Some companies make as many as 100 different variants of a single firearm. If they want their whole product range to be available in California they have to pay $200 for each and every model, every single year.\n \n If the handgun roster was really about ensuring the safety of the people of California, the period in which a handgun can be considered safe for sale wouldn't last only one calendar year unless renewed by another $200. Safety doesn't expire just because the date changes. Care to dispute that?\n \n \nWhy should firearms be exempt from consumer product safety testing again?\n\n \n How can a gun be considered consumer safe for only one year, when the testing procedures never differ?\n \n \nPeople have been killed by cheaply made firearms malfunctioning.

   "Hey Brandon,\n Here is what sliiick failed to tell you, the rest of the story!\n \n \nOne month later, the court issued its opinion.\n \n It was somewhat anti-climatic. \n \n In a five to one decision, with only Justice Werdegar dissenting, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Navegar's appeal. Their reasoning, or somewhat more appropriate, reason was not necessarily what either party expected. In brief, the court, with Justice Chin writing for the majority, held that the plaintiffs' suit, though worded in a manner to attempt to make it seem otherwise, was, in essence, nothing more than a product liability case involving a risk/benefit analysis and, as a result, was barred by section 1714.4. \n \n Navegar had made the claim all along. California's Supreme Court justices, however, were the first ones to listen. \n \n Justice Kline, in the section of his opinion regarding section 1714.4, focuses on Barker. According to Kline, while Assembly Bill 75 initially had a \"grander purpose,\" as it was amended, it simply dealt with the \"risk/benefit analysis\" prong of Barker's two tests. As Barker dealt with strict liability product design defect, common law negligence suits such as the plaintiffs' were not affected. This also seemed to be the Warren's opinion on the issue when he dismissed Navegar's demurrer. As Haerle does not mention section 1714.4 in his dissent, it might well have been his interpretation as well \n \n Justice Chin and the rest of the Supreme Court, with the exception of Justice Werdegar, did not abide by Justice Kline's limited reading of the statute. \n \n The main thrust of Chin's opinion is that \"products liability action\" does not simply mean the two tests articulated in Barker. About a page into his discussion, Chin states: \"A plaintiff may seek recovery in a 'products liability case' either 'on the theory of strict liability in tort or on the theory negligence.'\" According to Chin, the plaintiffs' having argued negligence does not move them out of the ambit of section 1714.4. In relation to the history of section 1714.4, Chin states: \"the revisions that occurred during section 1714.4's enactment process do not persuade us the Legislature either intended to exclude or in fact excluded plaintiffs' negligence claim from the statute's reach.\" And, according to Chin, neither does the wording of the plaintiffs' complaint. \n \n According to Chin, in their repeated pointings to the TEC-9/TEC-DC9's lack of civilian use and extreme potential danger, the plaintiffs were essentially asking the court to do exactly what section 1714.4 bars: a risk/benefit analysis. Moreover, Chin notes, \"even were plaintiffs correct that section 1714.4 applies by its term only to the strict liability theory of products liability, we would find that the policy the statute establishes bars plaintiffs' claim.\" \n \n The plaintiffs' case was over.\n \n For good measure, Chin dismisses the idea-first introduced by Judge Warren-that the AWCA changes things-\"We would read too much into the AWCA if we found in it the expression of a state policy that manufacturers of specified assault weapons may be civilly liable based on an assessment of the risks and benefits of making their product available to the general public, at least when they comply with the AWCA.\" In Chin's opinion, it simply was not what the plaintiffs' pled and, in fact, the plaintiffs' repeatedly dissuaded the court from regarding Navegar's advertising as separate from its production and distribution. \n \n In conclusion, Chin holds that even if the case were not barred by section 1714.4, no triable issues of fact regarding causation were present to begin with. Chin distinguishes Parke, Davis, from the situation at hand, as a case dealing with a professional product distributor, not a mere consumer like Ferri. There, according to Chin, the physician had prescribed the product by name and the only sources of information regarding the drug available to him were the manufacturer's advertising and visits from sales representatives. Thus, in Chin's opinion, despite the physicians' lack of memory regarding ever actually viewing promotional materials, it was entirely possible (and probable) to infer the necessary level of influence from the circumstantial evidence. In regards to Navegar, however, Chin cites the lack of any evidence \"direct or circumstantial\" that Ferri ever encountered Navegar's advertisements or promotional materials, and thus finds the circumstantial evidence clearly insufficient. \n \n Thus ended Merrill v. Navegar. \n \n The NRA's fax alert the next morning was titled \"California Supreme Court Rejects Brady Bunch's Reckless Suit.\" The subheading read: \"The suit against Navegar may have been the crown jewel in the gun-ban movement's ongoing attempt to bankrupt the lawful firearm industry.\"\n \n \n \n",

   "What if every gun maker took the stance Ronnie Barrett took with kalifornia and refused to service the State's guns and repair them?\n \n I think this makes the point and when they banned them anyway he delayed repair or service indefinitely. Perhaps other gun manufacturers could take a lesson in 'diplomacy' from this excellent source?\n \n \nJune 30, 2003 \n \n Chairman, Public Safety Committee\n State of California\n Sen. Bruce McPherson\n \n \n Via: Fax (916) 445-4688 \n \n Dear Senator McPherson, \n \n United States defense contractors such as Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Inc., Murfreesboro, TN USA rely on orders from the US Military as a primary source of income but this government income for most contractors is only part of the necessary income for long term survival. Commercial or civilian product sales are also a main source of income that makes payroll and for good working conditions for their employees. We must support these defense contractors in both peace and war and allow them to operate, market and sell their products under the rules, regulations and law of the Federal Government. There is a balance of customers among defense contractors that is necessary for sound, long term business and by eliminating commercial sales in California this balance is disrupted. To vote against .50 cal rifles puts jobs of your constituents as risk, the lives of your police at risk, and in the end the safety of the State of California at risk. Are you willing to jeopardize this? \n \n The defense industrial base in America is at risk of being unable to fully support our country in time of need without adequate opportunity for commercial sales of various products. In the Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Inc situation the civilian legal Barrett .50 cal rifle is at risk in the state of California. The attempt to ban a legal firearm not only violates the basic principals of the US Constitution but sets a precedence that endangers many vital defense contractors. In the Barrett case it also endangers California law enforcement agencies from having a proven and important tool in the fight against terrorism. \n \n * W. Hays Parks, Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate of the US Army wrote: \"The M82A1 Barrett... are manifestations of the important historic cooperation played by private citizens and small business in the United States in the development of weapons and munitions necessary for the US Armed Forces to perform their mission to protect the national security interests of the United States by fighting and winning, with as few friendly casualties as possible.\" This statement sums up the vital role both government and commercial business play in the sound business practices of various defense contractors of which Barrett is one. \n \n The Barrett .50 cal rifle was ascertained by the troops on the front lines in Iraq as the best performing small arm and they have the private defense contractor to thank for that weapon. Ban .50 cal rifles in California and you take this tool from your police also. The war on terror is not over! The Barrett .50 cal rifle has been in the hands of competitive shooters, hunters, and collectors for over 20 years and is a mainstay of the long range competitive shooters matches. It also serves on Police SWAT teams as the primary long range anti-sniper weapon. \n \n It is the Barrett position that we choose not to support in anyway state or local governments who are against the US Constitution and the safety and security of this nation. If California were to ban the sale of the Barrett .50 cal rifle we will stop the sale and service of all Barrett products to all State Law Enforcement agencies of the state of California immediately and ask all small arms manufactures to consider similar action. Re-classify the .50 cal rifle and you align yourself and the State of California as being part of the very terrorists who are attempting to destroy this great nation of ours. \n \n Please vote against banning or re-classifying .50 cal rifles. \n \n Respectively, \n \n \n \n\n \n How good are your cops and politicians with sticks? :)",

   "Could it be that firing the weapon a few hundred times is not one of the tests?\n\n \n No?\n \n 12125 thru 12133 Handgun Safety Testing - Dangerous Weapons Control Laws - Bureau of Firearms - California Dept. of Justice - Office of the Attorney General\n \n # 12127. (a) As used in this chapter, the \"firing requirement for handguns\" means a test in which the manufacturer provides three handguns of the make and model for which certification is sought, to an independent testing laboratory certified by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 12130. These handguns may not be refined or modified in any way from those that would be made available for retail sale if certification is granted. The magazines of a tested pistol shall be identical to those that would be provided with the pistol to a retail customer. The laboratory shall fire 600 rounds from each gun, stopping after each series of 50 rounds has been fired for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the weapon to cool, stopping after each series of 100 rounds has been fired to tighten any loose screws and clean the gun in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and stopping as needed to refill the empty magazine or cylinder to capacity before continuing. The ammunition used shall be of the type recommended by the handgun manufacturer in the user manual, or if none is recommended, any standard ammunition of the correct caliber in new condition that is commercially available. A handgun shall pass this test if each of the three test guns meets both of the following: (1) Fires the first 20 rounds without a malfunction that is not due to ammunition that fails to detonate. (2) Fires the full 600 rounds with no more than six malfunctions that are not due to ammunition that fails to detonate and without any crack or breakage of an operating part of the handgun that increases the risk of injury to the user. (b) If a pistol or revolver fails the requirements of either paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) due to ammunition that fails to detonate, the pistol or revolver shall be retested from the beginning of the \"firing requirement for handguns\" test. A new model of the pistol or revolver that failed due to ammunition that fails to detonate may be submitted for the test to replace the pistol or revolver that failed. (c) As used in this section, \"malfunction\" means a failure to properly feed, fire, or eject a round, or failure of a pistol to accept or eject the magazine, or failure of a pistol's slide to remain open after the magazine has been expended.\n \n \nI thought it was to provide for Brandon and see to it that it might not happen again.\n\n \n Had the suit occurred today instead of before the Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, it would've been thrown out on grounds similar to so many other lawsuits against the firearms industry.\n \n \nWho said the baby-sitter had experience with handguns?\n\n \n How stupid does one have to be before they think that pulling the trigger on a gun won't result in a discharge?\n \n \nYou're kidding, right? Why do you suppose we test all other consumer products?\n\n \n I'd like to see some proof of that. Where are the tests on power tools like chainsaws that can easily remove a limb? Do you have standards for kitchen knives to make sure they're not easy to use for illegal stabbings, or that they're not classified as \"too sharp\"?\n \n I don't see testing procedures for shotguns and rifles either. Where are those?",

You are still dancing in the blood sliiiiiiick...that went out of style some time ago.\n My next goal is to see these anti Constitutional treasonists behind bars for life. A training program would be more beneficial than that goat rope you call a \"consumer protection agency\" to extort fees from manufacturers, BREAK the interstate commerce clause and put folks in danger from stigmatizing the legitimater use and exercise of a gun.

   "Well then I guess it is. Who can say then why one hasn't failed?\n\n \n It certainly casts doubt on the validity of the tests California performs. But then again so do some of the listings on the handgun roster. Models some would consider inferior are on there, while higher quality models are left unmentioned.\n \n And it was never explained just what California's tests can tell us that we don't already know. Surely if a sidearm is sufficient for military or police duty, it's more than sufficient for civilian use. After all the military requires something tough, rugged, reliable and safe no matter the condition it's going to operate it.\n \n The SIG P226, as well as its compact variant the P228, are used by 35 different military forces in the world, as well as numerous police departments and the Secret Service. What can California add to that? The 1911 has been in steady military service for 74 years, outlasting three main battle rifles, being fielded by 28 various world governments, and is still in use with numerous special forces such as Delta Force and the Army Rangers, not to mention various SWAT teams.\n \n With examples like that, California's tests seem redundant and even condescending in nature. I really don't see the justification for the tests in the first place, when the state can't be sued over the issue of a faulty firearm. Seems more like nanny state mentality than a genuine concern for public safety.",

   "Girls with guns - Local women learn to protect themselves - White Mountain Independent: Latest News\n \n \nAccording to the Department of Justice, three of four women will experience at least one violent crime. Various studies have proven just displaying a firearm will scare off a high percentage of offenders. There are roughly 307 million people in the United States as of 2009. Approximately 16,272 murders were committed in 2008 and about 67 percentage for those were committed with firearms. A study published in 2000 by the Journal of Quantitative Criminology reported that civilians use guns to defend themselves at least 989,883 times a year.\n \n There are no hard and fast figures on the number of women gun owners, but the estimates by various gun organizations are that the number is over 17 million and growing.\n\n \n Tuesday's Letters: Self-defense is a fundamental right - St. Petersburg Times\n \n \nArthur Hayhoe is wrong when he says that Florida's \"stand your ground\" law turns Florida into the Wild West. Just the opposite is true. The reason that justifiable homicides are increasing is simple. Florida abandoned the old \"duty to retreat\" standards that placed an unfair burden on the victim, who had to make an instant decision when confronted with imminent death or great bodily harm. The victim could very well turn and run, but at serious risk to his/her successful self-defense.\n\n \n ...and the bad guys getting shot is a bad thing?",
