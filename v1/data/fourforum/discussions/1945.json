   "I thought I would pose this question, just for fun...\n \n Advocates of legal abortion suggest that every individual should have the choice of what they can and cannot do with their own body, and regardless of whether or not a pre-born human entity is considered a 'person' with legal rights, the mother has the right to destroy the entity because it is using her body without her consent. Opponents of legal abortion suggest that there are at least two 'persons' at stake -- both deserving of legal protection, and the right of life of the pre-born human entity supercedes the rights of the mother to be free of the pregnancy through forced means. \n \n Consider that seat belt laws exist in many states that legally remove the choice of the individual regarding seat belt use. What is the reasoning behind these laws? On the surface, at least, it is to save lives. In other words, there is a precedent for laws being enacted which makes a specific choice illegal in order to potentially save lives.\n \n So... I pose this question for debate... what is the difference between a law restricting the choice of whether or not a seatbelt must be worn and a law restricting the choice of whether or not an abortion may legally be performed?\n \n In reality, no matter what laws exist, every individual does have the choice of what they can or cannot do with their own body. A law cannot 'force' someone into wearing their seatbelt, just as outlawing abortion could not 'force' anyone to carry their pregnancy to term. True, someone may be punished for not following the law, but no law anywhere can force anyone to do anything.",

   "Perhaps the law is in place more to prevent injury rather than to save lives. Injured persons cost more than dead people, so it is a societal benefit to keep people healthy.\n\n I've thought about this to some degree... and I agree that seat belt laws (and possibly speed limit laws) are probably in place more for the reduced financial cost to society than for the lives that are potentially saved. Though I believe it is accurate to say that these laws are generally marketed to the public more as a means to save lives.\n \n I'm sure some sort of statistics exist to make some sort of comparisons, but I don't know the first place to start looking. I'd be interested to know the average financial cost to taxpayers for accidents in which the participants were wearing a seatbelt vs not-wearing a seatbelt... both the immediate costs and long-term costs. I'd also be interested to know the parallel statistics for a woman who has an abortion vs a woman who chooses to bring the pregnancy to its natural end. Anyone have any idea where these may be found?",

   "I know you would really have to take my posts apart to find that I am NOT against abortion. I believe that it is justified in some cases. But, my beliefs thrive on my belief system, doesn&#8217;t it?\n \n But to the post:\n \n IMHO- comparing abortion to the seatbelt laws is essentially what is unwanted&#8230;right? Will we see a written law that requires abortion in certain cases? I don&#8217;t think so. But, I do think, eventually, we will see a broadcast law that allows abortion in all cases.\n \n But, I think one has to look at abortion as a war sometimes. An intruder (fertilized egg) finds his way into a country (woman&#8217;s body) and immediately sets up camp, living off the fat of the land. The land either supports the intruder or starts to reject him (due to various factors, such as food supply diminishing, environmental changes, etc.) The land has the right to expel the intruder if he will not leave peacefully or the land could face deterioration or total collapse (death).\n \n The meaning of deterioration or demise can only be decided by the land itself. No other country should be able to decide for it&#8230;unless that land requests advice.\n \n So, that brings us back to the age-old question: On what grounds do we base our decisions whether or not abortion is justified?\n \n Statistics show that seatbelts saves lives and decreases the probability of injury.\n \n Show me any statistic that shows how an individual should be affected by pregnancy&#8230;\n \n There lies the difference and the dilemma.",

   "I personally don't see the dilemma, but rather, moral judgements from people that will probably never have to face an unwanted or dangerous pregnancy. \n \n The personal right of not choosing to wear a seatbelt infringes on societies rights not to have to pay ridiculous amounts of money to rehabilitate someone that was stupid enough to have an accident while not wearing a seatbelt. If we could guarantee that car accidents would all result in death or injuries sustained would require no medical treatment, then there would be little impact on society and hence the peronal right not to wear a seatbelt could be upheld.\n \n Using the above logic, how can abortion infringe on our societys rights?\n \n Questioning how an individual could be affected by pregnancy is just another way of passing a moral judgement. That question simply suggests that an individual may or may not have a personal right to choose in certain circumstances. \n \n If we are seriously respecting individual rights, the real question is: at what point does the rights of a foetus exceed that of the individual whose body it is using? Then we are back to square one on arguing when life begins. \n \n The only fair answer is to transfer the foetus to another willing host. So on with technology!",
