   "If I understand the question, I'm sure it has to do with the difference between evidence and proof.\n Evidence is a human measurement or evaluation of the \"real world\" or 'truth\". It is an interpretation or existence. \n Sufficient evidence becomes proof, or acceptable proof.\n If I may play the devil's advocate for Dr Wise, I suppose he would say he does not find the evidence to be convincing. He has evidence to the contrary, which he does find convincing.\n \n What you are really wondering (if I may presume to read your mind), is why he does not find the supporting evidence to be convincing. On any issue where there are two sides, there is evidence for each side, and the observer will decide what evidence is more acceptable or stronger.\n There are those who believe the moon landing was a hoax. They readily admit that there is supporting evidence that it actually happened, but they disregard this evidence as unconvincing. They have evidence of their own, which they find convincing.\n We might make the argument that an \"impartial observer would say...\", but if it is truth that I seek, I do not rely on \"impartial observers\". In the end I rely on my own resources. It is sometimes assumed that impartial observers will be \"more objective\", and therefore closer to the truth than subjective observers. \n We do not live our daily lives like this. \n If I want to know what is wrong with my car, I do not want an impartial car mechanic. I want a mechanic who is familiar my make and model of car. I want one who is partial to my situation. He has a subjective opinion about what is wrong with my car, and I will want to know it is, if I want to fix my car.\n \n Each of us decides what is acceptable evidence, and we base our view of reality on this. Supporting evidence to the contrary, is just not convincing.",

He has evidence to the contrary, which he does find convincing.\n\n \n From what I've read of his statements, he's abandoned science because it conflicts with his religious ideas. And he believes because of what scripture says, not what any scientific amount of evidence states. \n \n \ntry as I might, and even with the benefit of intact margins throughout the pages of Scripture, I found it impossible to pick up the Bible without it being rent in two. I had to make a decision between evolution and Scripture. Either the Scripture was true and evolution was wrong or evolution was true and I must toss out the Bible. . . . It was there that night that I accepted the Word of God and rejected all that would ever counter it, including evolution. With that, in great sorrow, I tossed into the fire all my dreams and hopes in science.\n\n \n http://www.scepsis.ru/eng/articles/id_2.php\n \n So it's not evidence vs evidence, it's evidence vs religious belief.

   "What drives some creationists to new levels of dishonesty that obviously not supported in the Bible?\n \n What drives some creationists to be honest, such as Dr. Kurt Wise who have stated that they will stand by scripture DESPITE knowing that the evidence supports evolution?\n\n \n I can only compare this to the effects of cognitive dissonance. This happens when something you believe contradicts reality. You have to become ignorant of the belief, reality, or both.\n \n Many creationists are ignorant of the bible and of science. They use incorrect definitions of evolution and biology. They also ignore blatant foolish statements within the bible. The best of both worlds in ignorance allows them to continue being creationists.\n \n The bible will invariably contradict reality, as it was written by ancient men who were uneducated about reality. The religious crowd will always try to impede science, since science looks at reality, and religion doesn't need to. Religion has successfully halted science before and will do it again if people become complacent. The Christian religion made the most progress during what we call the Dark Ages.\n \n Science will continue its progress. Popular religious text necessarily stays the same, but the way culture ignores parts of it and \"interprets\" it will change to fit common knowledge of the culture. (For instance, now popular religions have the PR of being about love and treating fellow human beings respectfully. Generations ago, the church condoned and performed torture of witches. Slavery can be easily supported by scripture.) \n \n Cognitive dissonance causes people who *truly* believe in the bible to ignore reality. You get guys like Kurt Wise when that happens. Others resolve their dissonance by ignoring what the bible truly says. Many \"moderate\" christians consider mentions of unicorns, four corners of the earth, and a magical garden as just \"symbolic\" and/or \"not literal.\" The bible states light was here before stars. It states animals were created in one day. It states some illnesses can be cured by dead birds' blood. But to solve the dissonance one feels when reality confronts faith, they ignore these things.\n Of course, you have those that can't reconcile their faith in the bible with contradictions from reality. They'll value rational thought over mystical thinking, and eventually lose faith. (I became a born again atheist, and was helped immensely by reading the bible itself!)\n \n \n I think becoming ignorant of the religion may be a step in the right direction. Piece by piece, the bible may fall into the realm of \"symbolic\" and \"not literal\" until it's dismissed entirely. Of course, the church also ruled effectively when people couldn't read the bible, so the ignorance could backfire. Let's just hope science in America holds its ground; otherwise some of our brightest minds will have to go overseas to find employment.",

However, they aren't the subject here. It's the creationists who believe in young earth, literalists that are the subject. \n \n \nThey are doing this because they are willing to accept much of science, but do not put it above their interpretations of the sacred texts.\n\n \n I don't agree with this at all. They use science to claim evolution is wrong without understanding any of it (ie: 2nd law of thermodynamics). Furthermore creationists like archangel claim that sciences that deal with million to billion year old things are fairy tales. That would mean they must not believe in chemistry, physics, astronomy or geology. In many cases they lie about what science actually says to augment their claims. \n \n \nFor some of us, scientific evidence is above sacred texts, and sacred texts must conform to scientific evidence.\n\n \n A sacred text is hardly sacred when it gets the basics wrong. \n \n \nOthers will say we lie about the truth in the bible, to support our mistaken views of science. When it says \"a day\" we lie and say that may mean a million years.\n\n \n Perhaps, but that part was never really clear as to the time frame.\n \n \nYou are constructing an artificial dichotomy between science and religion.\n\n \n On the contrary I do no such thing, it is the creationists who claim that evolution and science are atheistic not I. Dr. Wise's statements however do create a dichotomy between science and religion. Science and religion can gel easily in many aspects, it is just that literal views such as genesis result in dichotomies. \n \n \nCertainly they are at odds with each other at times, but they are not separate or independent from each other.\n\n \n We haven't actually discussed the subject. \n \n Let's go over a few examples:\n \n Archangel posted a website that had hoax pictures of flying dinosaurs as proof of creation. He was corrected as these pictures were of a prop made for a TV show for Fox. He has yet to admit he is wrong or that he fell for a hoax. Secondly, he claimed falsely that according to 'known understanding of flight' bumble bees can't fly despite clear scientific understanding of dynamic stalling. He dishonestly presented a false argument and when corrected refused to admit he was wrong.\n \n What drives people to do such things?",

Getting Tenure from their School for the research they have done, and simply making more money. These pressures are great motivators for one to falsify the results of tests, research and experiments for a science that they sincerely believe is valid anyway.\n \n The number of purposeful hoaxes discovered to exist in Evolution science for example can be tracked back to one of the above reasons in every case. Greed and the need for personal recognition being the most obvious. So when those who place their faith in science call people who believe in God superstitious geldings who follow a myth to supplant some deep seeded need to belong to, or to be forgiven for some unspoken personal shortcoming or guilt. Should instead investigate what deep seeded need they have to trust a study that is so flawed that before one can trust it they must first investigate the motives and honesty of those doing the experiments whose results they so readily place their faith in.\n \n I cannot prove my relationship with the Living God is real and coherent but neither can an unbeliever prove it isn't. And I maintain that it took original faith for me to reach out to Jesus Christ, but since meeting Him personally and possessing His Holy Spirit within me, It takes no faith at all to maintain this relationship as He literally dwells within me moment by moment and day by day. We are one in the spirit and our relationship is supernatural according to definitions used by the Natural Man who has no such experiential evidence of what a believer has received by grace from the Creator of us all.\n \n BTW, excellent arguments and welcome to the forum.",

Furthermore much of Genesis doesn't even make any sense. A literal view of Genesis requires a belief that God is deliberately trying to trick mankind. That's rather contrary to the belief that God is perfect.

Not to mention that you're not suppose to test God which would be a act of removing faith. \n \n \nOthers have intuited the bible to be true, and the resulting belief system finds science to be based on faith.\n\n \n I disagree with this.

He understand the sciences, he merely chooses to supersede those beliefs with religion.\n \n Meanwhile we have Arch here who believes that his car is powered by Angels since geology which plays a huge role in hydrocarbon exploration is a 'fairy tale.' Those who reject science are those who do not understand it.",

   "obvious child How is it relevant what I put my faith in?\nWell, you say something arrived at by faith is not evidence. If you arrived at trusting implicitly in the scientific method by faith (as I contend), then clearly your findings by the scientific method are not evidence.\n Wasn't it obvious?\n \n \nobvious child Science is true because science can be accountable. The modern world is a result of practical application of science. The net product from science is what validates science. I have a ziplock plastic container sitting on my desk with a cookie in it. Science was the reason why some research discovered polymers that allowed the creation of such a product.\n\n As I said, your only evidence that science is true is more science.\n From some perspectives, science has done as much harm as good. If this is true, your evidence is useless.\n I say the goal of individuals (or society) should be right action towards others.\n Electricity, antibiotics, polymers, nuclear energy, a man on the moon, none of these improves the actions of persons towards others. When it comes the \"really important\" issues, science is useless.\n \n BeHereNow Scientific evidence which supports science is circular reasoning. \n \n obvious childI fail to see how something that can be directly traced back and tested for existence is circular logic in proving its validity.\nIt is used to validate itself. That is circular.\n When you say \"traced back and tested for existence\", you of course mean tested by scientific means. If we test it based on some other standard, it fails. Science says evolution is true. If we test it with the orthodox interpretation of virtually any religious text, it fails.\n Science is true, only if you believe science. Evolution is true, if you believe in evolution.\n \n \n BeHereNowIt is no different than using the bible to support the bible.\n obvious child How do you come to that conclusion? The Bible cannot be tested. Furthermore the bible itself does not produce any tangible effects.\nOf course it can be tested. You just don't like the tests, because they are not scientific. \n It seem obvious to me that Christians test the bible with prayer. \n They also test it by reasoning. It is possible to follow the rules of logic and arrive at a false conclusion. They start their reasoning process with the assumption that the bible is true. They know the bible is true because they have prayed about it. \n \n \n  obvious child Except that it contradicts the world. The Bible story of Genesis has no evidence whatsoever. \nThere you go again making that ridicules statement that there is no evidence, when you really mean there is no scientific evidence. The entire bible supports the Genesis story. Not a thing in the bible refutes the Genesis story. And did I mention prayer? More than one Christian has told me they prayed about evolution and the answer was \"believe Genesis\".\n \n \nobvious child Furthermore much of Genesis doesn't even make any sense. A literal view of Genesis requires a belief that God is deliberately trying to trick mankind. \nWell, it may require you to believe that (undoubtedly related to this obsessive faith you have in science). I can assure you that millions of Christians will disagree with you. The biblical god is not about trick or treat.\n I myself (a Zen-Deist-Jeffersonian-Christian) do not find that a literal reading of Genesis requires a belief that god is trying to trick mankind. Certainly that spin can be applied, but it is not required.\n That's rather contrary to the belief that God is perfect. IMO, YEC is heretical as it cast the Christian God with traits of Satan. \n \nBeHereNow Each of us intuits one or more pillars to be true, and our belief system follows.\n You have intuited science to be true, and the resulting belief system finds the bible to be based on faith. \n obvious child Huh? Christians accept their belief system on faith. Both them and I see their belief systems as not proof based but faith based. Not to mention that you're not suppose to test God which would be a act of removing faith. \n \n The proof is in the bible. Once the bible is accepted on faith, it provides all of the proof that is needed.\n It is true that religion is labeled as \"faith based\", and science is not. This is because religion has may pillars that are tall and spindly. It is heavily reliant on faith.\n On the other hand, scientific belief systems have few pillars and they are short and solid. They are only loosely reliant on faith, at the very beginning.\n All belief systems are based on faith. Some admit it, some do not.\n \n Does the supernatural exist?\n Science can not test the supernatural. Science can only test the natural.\n A reasonable person with a scientific belief system would say \"I do not know if the supernatural exists or not, because science can not examine it.\"\n An unreasonable person with the same belief system will say \"I do not believe in the supernatural because it cannot be shown to be true by scientific methods.\" \n \n That same reasonable person, when confronted with witnesses that have experienced the supernatural, will conclude the supernatural does exist, because their own belief system can not address the issue, and others have antidotal evidence that there are supernatural occurrences.\n \n I myself have intuited that there are no supernatural occurrences, only natural occurrences not properly understood.",

IMO, your argument isn't even on the same planet now as what I was talking about. \n \n \nIf we test it based on some other standard, it fails. Science says evolution is true.\n\n \n Says?

Some Christians believe that Genesis is a way to explain the origins of the world to ignorant nomadic Israelites and that actually explaining things as God could do, would be a giant waste of time to people who are worried about finding a meal and not being enslaved or killed by Egyptians. These Christians are often educated, which perhaps is not all that surprising. \n \n \nWell, it may require you to believe that (undoubtedly related to this obsessive faith you have in science).\n\n \n How about you define faith or at least use my definition? I'm not going to play word games, use the definition or leave. I have no faith in science as I have evidence of its workings. One cannot have evidence and faith of the same thing as faith is a belief in something with no evidence. If something HAS evidence it can no longer be included in Faith beliefs. This is the definition I was using from the first place, one you seem very keen on ignoring for the desires of your argument, which is rather dishonest. \n \n \nI can assure you that millions of Christians will disagree with you. The biblical god is not about trick or treat.\n\n \n yet to believe in a 6,000 year old world the Biblical God MUST be deceptive as the world does not show evidence of creation a mere 6,000 years ago.

They are only loosely reliant on faith, at the very beginning.\n All belief systems are based on faith. Some admit it, some do not.\n\n \n You mix all types of faith into one. That deliberately obfuscates the debate. Try to avoid this. \n \n \nDoes the supernatural exist?\n Science can not test the supernatural. Science can only test the natural.\n A reasonable person with a scientific belief system would say \"I do not know if the supernatural exists or not, because science can not examine it.\"\n An unreasonable person with the same belief system will say \"I do not believe in the supernatural because it cannot be shown to be true by scientific methods.\"\n\n \n Not quite. A reasonable person with a scientific belief system would say \"I do not know if the supernatural exists or not, because science can not currently examine it.\" Some scientists have theorized what we see can be explained through fundamental aspects of the universe.\n \n So there are two options here assuming God was involved in creation:\n \n 1) God created everything according to literal genesis and then covered everything up. \n 2) God did not create everything according to literal genesis. \n \n \n We still haven't actually discussed the subject.

If that is your intention, I would agree.\n As one, I would say it is a matter of faith that everything can be explained by \"natural\" means. By that I mean that humans, who are part of the natural world, have full capability to examine, test, and acquire all knowledge of all things. Included in this would be the assumption that if there are souls, ghosts, spirits, demons, these things can be verified by the scientific method. \n \n ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n \n Well obvious child, it seem you have problems following a discussion, and you make me spoon feed you.\n \n \nBHN If you arrived at trusting implicitly in the scientific method by faith (as I contend), then clearly your findings by the scientific method are not evidence.\n Wasn't it obvious? \n \n obvious child Except I have not done so.

I have no faith in the method. I have a understanding that it works by practice. \n\n We can agree that it works, to a limited extent. You imply that it works universally, which is a leap of faith. \n What is your evidence that it works universally?\n What is your evidence that if there are demons, the scientific method can verify them?\n What is your evidence that if there is a god, he did not create the world with deposits that appear to be 4 million years old?\n What is your evidence that the miraculous creations of god (something out of nothing) never occurred?\n \n \nBHN As I said, your only evidence that science is true is more science.\n obvious child Science is empirically testable, Faith is not. \n\n Your lack of understanding amazes me.\n You exactly prove my point, but you think you have offered a rebuttal.\n \"Empirical testing\" is science. \n You use science to verify science. \n You verify science by empirical testing. \n How can I possible make this any clearer to you.\n If you operate in the closed system of empirical testing, of course only empirically testable hypothesis' can be shown true. Instantaneous creation of the universe is not empirically testable, therefore, according to your mad hatter logic, it is not possible. \n You have faith that only empirically testable occurrences can happen. \n If it is not faith, it is circular reasoning, which is fallacious reasoning.\n \n \nBHN From some perspectives, science has done as much harm as good.\n [obvious child][/b] How is that relevant?\n\n (More spoon feeding).\n You say \"Science is true because science can be accountable. The modern world is a result of practical application of science. The net product from science is what validates science.\" \n You assume the net product from science is beneficial. You then imply that IF this is true, THEN science is validated. \n \n What if your assumption is not true? \n Well anyone with a smattering of logic would realize that in that case science is NOT validated.\n If those people who say that modern science has turned people away from god are correct, and further, that more people will be condemned to eternal damnation because of science, then certainly it is relevant whether your assumption is true. If these things are true, science is NOT valided.\n I hope that makes your own comments clearer to you.\n \n \nobvious child Because? How is good or harm even relevant? This is on existence, evidence and testing, not on the net benefit.\n (and)\n Again, relevance?\n (and)\n How is this related to the subject?\n\n Please see above.\n \n \nBHN If we test it with the orthodox interpretation of virtually any religious text, it fails.\n obvious child Pray tell how do we test with religion? Ask God to see if it matches? Compare it to a religious text? Who's interpretation do we use?\nWell you have a little understanding of the situation.\n Yes, those who favor religious world views over scientific world views will refer to their god and their religious texts. \n There are common threads throughout most religious texts and oral traditions, all of which have to do with a supreme being creating the world (universe) by a non-natural means. Virtually none of them support evolution. \n \n It is common knowledge to most of us that Christians pray to god for answers, and they believe (based on the evidence of their experiences), that these prayers are answered. If they want to know whether it is evolution or creation which is true, prayer is a tested and proven means of getting the answer.\n \n \nobvious child You seem to throw around belief as if it meant understanding. I suggest you learn the difference. I can believe the Moon is made of cheese. I can understand it is not.\n\n Here is a prime example of your lack of understanding of the common usage of words.\n A belief is an understanding.\n Belief: a state or habit of mind in which trust or confidence is placed in some person or thing.\n A belief can be true, or it can be false, but it is an understanding regardless.\n \n If you understand that the moon is NOT made of cheese, you cannot possibly have a belief that it is made of cheese. That is IMPOSSIBLE for a sane, rational person, which says a lot about your state of mind.\n \n \nBHN It seem obvious to me that Christians test the bible with prayer.\n obvious child Huh? That makes no sense.\nI believe I covered this previously. Christians get answers to questions by reading the bible, and by prayer. In the prayer they ask for understanding of questionable things. \n I will assume the fault here, assuming that you have been to church and understand the purposes of prayer. If you do not understand the purposes of prayer, of course you will not understand my comment.\n \n \nobvious child How is that not circular logic? One prays about a book they believe to be true and find perceptively that their beliefs support their preconceived notions!\n \n \"God exists because the bible said so and God wrote the bible!\"\nPlease try to stay on track.\n Of course it is circular reasoning. I never hinted, implied or suggested otherwise.\n All beliefs systems, at their core, are guilty of circular reasoning. I have stated or implied that repeatedly. I am sorry it went over your head.\n \n \nobvious child Depends how you classify evidence. Depends how you classify faith. I have made clear distinctions as to what falls in each, you appear to deliberately avoid doing just that, similar to what Marc9000 did.\nAgain your attempt at a rebuttal merely demonstrates my point. You define \"evidence\" so that only scientific evidence qualifies, then say the bible, prayer, divine revelation, are not evidence. Within the system of religious beliefs, these things are evidence every bit as much as your scientific evidence.\n \n \nobvious child And how do they know those were not voices? Furthermore genesis and evolution are not exclusively. Only literalists have a problem gelling the two. Many moderate to liberal interpretations easily interpret that evolution is God's tool. Many Christians accept that 'day' really meant billions of years, or that day has no real time reference as it was written in the days before calculated measures. Some Christians believe that Genesis is a way to explain the origins of the world to ignorant nomadic Israelites and that actually explaining things as God could do, would be a giant waste of time to people who are worried about finding a meal and not being enslaved or killed by Egyptians. These Christians are often educated, which perhaps is not all that surprising.\nAll of these things are true, but beside the point. The discussion is about the world view of literalists or creationists. Certainly all of their beliefs may be figments of their imagination, just as mine or yours might be. Certainly they may be correct and the liberal Christians may be mistaken.\n \n \nobvious child How about you define faith or at least use my definition? I'm not going to play word games, use the definition or leave. I have no faith in science as I have evidence of its workings. One cannot have evidence and faith of the same thing as faith is a belief in something with no evidence. If something HAS evidence it can no longer be included in Faith beliefs. This is the definition I was using from the first place, one you seem very keen on ignoring for the desires of your argument, which is rather dishonest.\nWe have no disagreement on the meaning of faith.\n \n Once ANY belief system is up and running, it does not require faith.\n \n If I assume god is real, and reveals himself and his workings in the bible, and prayer to my personal god will yield truthful answers, I have all of the evidence I need to say a literalist view is correct. No faith is required.\n \n If I assume the entire world (universe) is understandable and verifiable with the scientific method, I have all of the evidence I need to say a literalist view is incorrect. No faith is required.\n \n And of course there are many positions in between these two extremes, which likewise require no faith once the belief system is in operation.\n \n \n \nobvious child yet to believe in a 6,000 year old world the Biblical God MUST be deceptive as the world does not show evidence of creation a mere 6,000 years ago.\nYour myopic view is staggering. \n What is acceptable evidence to you does not satisfy the rest of the world. It is not just the biblical account that makes the world (universe) or existence of mankind unrealistically young according to scientific evidence. Virtually all religions have this commonality.\n \n \nobvious child And what level of education in the sciences do you have?\nWell, that is a good question. \n But I need to point out that the answer will only give us half of the relevant information you are trying to point out. \n We will also need to know what your level of education is in religion and philosophy.\n \n Since I am willing to detail the first half, I trust you will detail the second half.\n If my education on one side of the fence is relevant, certainly your education on the other side of the fence is relevant. How can it be any other way?\n \n There are of course two types of education, formal and informal, or self-study.\n Most people posing a question such as yours mean formal, so I will start there.\n I have no MA, MS or PhD. I have taken post graduate classes in ethics and philosophy, but do not hold a masters degree. Among the 180+ credits I have from accredited, (in classroom) classes, about 50 are in religion, philosophy, ethics, etc. In the natural sciences probably only 25 or thirty. These would include chemistry, biology, physics, astronomy, all at the 100 or 200 level.\n My BA is in elementary education, which I attained over three decades ago. \n I have attended four Universities, three of them after getting my degree.\n I consider my independent studies to be similar. I have taught adult Sunday School classes in three Christian denominations. Although I am well read on Christian commentaries (Scoffield, Matthew Henry, Dr. Morris, others), most of my readings have been in Zen.\n \n By the way, I feel compelled to point out that philosophy (my first love) includes epistemology, which is certainly one of your many weak points.\n \n \n Does your background in religion and philosophy compare favorably with mine?\n \n \n \n \n \nobvious child We still haven't actually discussed the subject. Please address just my comment on Dr. Kurt wise as that was what the subject was about before you took it on a massively distracting tangent.\n\n Comment: What drives some creationists to be honest, such as Dr. Kurt Wise who have stated that they will stand by scripture DESPITE knowing that the evidence supports evolution?\n Quite simply, his allegiance to his beliefs. Why is that so hard to understand.\n \n ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n \n You continually try to apply your standards of beliefs to other systems.\n You fail to understand that your world view is not shared by some very rational, intelligent persons.",

The fact that space and time did not exist prior to the creation of matter and the physical universe, (since, after all, space and time are accidental properties of matter and its motion, and so are dependent upon the motion and disposition of matter for the fact of their own existence), in no way obviates the necessity of a pre-existing condition/state/entity out of which matter and its time/space were generated. You cannot get around the axiom that nothingness can only generate more nothingness, and that anything that has a beginning came from something actual that pre-exists it, and therefore _must_ have been caused by something other than itself. Your 'singularity' is just a fancy word for 'magick'.\n \n As for Einstein, last time I looke his theories were about the universe as it is, and the place of space and time in the universe as it is.

None of which speaks to the fact that since matter had a beginning, and its accidents had a beginning, (Big Bang, \"Singularity\"), whatever, that any of this popped out of nowhere and nothing for no reason, all by itself, unassisted and without any prior form. Materialists, (but to my knowledge, not Einstein), believe that only \"Matter\" truly exists, and that space, time, and absolutely everything else you can name are accidents, epiphenomena, that arise out of matter and its motion. Therefore, in accordance with this metaphysical assumption, nothing can or did pre-exist matter, and since matter did not pre-exist \"The Big Bang\", aka, \"The Singularity\", then only nothing and nothingness preceded it.

   "**\n Actually, you are the one talking twaddle and gibberish. \"Singularities\" are fanciful notions dreampt up to support an 'a priori' Materialist assumption of 'spontaneous generation' and 'creatio ab nihilo'. The fact that space and time did not exist prior to the creation of matter and the physical universe, (since, after all, space and time are accidental properties of matter and its motion, and so are dependent upon the motion and disposition of matter for the fact of their own existence), in no way obviates the necessity of a pre-existing condition/state/entity out of which matter and its time/space were generated. You cannot get around the axiom that nothingness can only generate more nothingness, and that anything that has a beginning came from something actual that pre-exists it, and therefore _must_ have been caused by something other than itself. Your 'singularity' is just a fancy word for 'magick'.\n\n \n Incorrect. A singularity is an aspect of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.\n Space-time is the universe, matter did not begin to form till 380,000 years after the big bang, being a essentially a form of energy (E=mcc).\n Time is not dependant on matter, nor is space. By your assertion vacuum should not exist as it contains no matter and would therefore occupy no space emoticon_rolleyes and as there is no matter does not experience time.\n \n \nSolutions to the equations of general relativity or another theory of gravity (such as supergravity), often result in encountering points where the metric blows up to infinity. However, many of these points are in fact completely regular. Moreover, the infinities are merely a result of using an inappropriate coordinate system at this point. Thus, in order to test whether there is a singularity at a certain point, one must check whether at this point diffeomorphism invariant quantities (i.e. scalars) become infinite. Such quantities are the same in every coordinate system, so these infinities will not \"go away\" by a change of coordinates.\n Conical singularities\n A conical singularity occurs when there is a point where the limit of every diffeomorphism invariant quantity is finite. In which case, spacetime is not smooth at the point of the limit itself. Thus, spacetime looks like a cone around this point, where the singularity is located at the tip of the cone. The metric can be finite everywhere if a suitable coordinate system is used.\n In spite of its overwhelming success, there is discomfort with general relativity in the scientific community due to its being incompatible with quantum mechanics and the reachable singularities of black holes (at which the math of general relativity breaks down). Because of this, numerous other theories have been proposed as alternatives to general relativity. An early and still-popular class of modifications is Brans-Dicke theory, which, although not solving the problems of singularities and quantum gravity, appeared to have observational support in the 1960s. However, those observations have since been refuted and modern measurements indicate that any Brans-Dicke type of deviation from general relativity must be very small if it exists at all.\n\n Given that Einstein published the theory of general relativity in 1915 and Hubble didn't note the redshift of galaxies till 1922 one wonders how honest your interpetation of, well just about anything and everything, to be some sort of cover up really is.",

You so pontificate solely on the basis of your ideological need to preserve an atheistic perspective that denies, 'a priori', the existence of anything but this physical universe, 'space/time', or whatever, which might be called, 'god'.

All that matters is the acceptance of the main fact--that this universe is NOT, contra materialism, the sum total of all that exists. That a state of existence is actual and real, beyond the parameters of this particular physical universe. That is 'reality', 'space/time', 'universe' is only an included piece of a greater something that IS, and is truly all that there IS.\n You don't have to call it 'god' if you don't want to. In fact, since that word is constantly confused for an anthropomorphic magician who is somehow separate and distinct from our 'natural' universe, I'd personally prefer that you didn't. \n \n This is the great existence, The One, in and out of which quarks, and physical universes like ours, come into existence. 'Creatio ex nihilo' is falsified, because everything that has physical existence, quark or universe, arises out of that which exists eternally, and out of which all possible entities may be formed-- not 'de novo', in a magical 'poof' out of nothingness.\n \n \n\n This is conjecture, you will say; and so it is.

Both of these solutions of course present significant logical and conceptual problems. For physicists, these ideas take the following forms:\n \n 'Infinite time' model: Either \n 1) The Big Bang was preceeded by a previous universe which 'recycled' itself into this one; all the major theories concerning the hypothetical fate of the universe (Big Crunch, Heat Death, Big Rip) suggest possibilities for some cyclical process or\n 2) The universe (and others like it?) exists within a higher-dimensional framework; this is the horrifically abstract but apparently mathematically sound Brane Cosmology.\n \n 'Finite time' model: This one is harder to conceptualise, and harder to accept, and much of modern theory is moving away from it, precisely because it suggests that something came from nothing. The basic premise is familiar; that time itself was created in the Big Bang, therefore to speak of anything happening or even existing before it is literally meaningless. But of course this is inconceivable to the human mind. All I can really say in defense of this notion is that many of the well-established facts of relativity and quantum mechanics are pretty much impossible to satisfactorily conceptualise. \n \n This avenue of thought has yielded very little in the way of answers. Admittedly, the 'infinite time' model is hardly awash with answers, but at least it has provided frameworks for further theoretical exploration, unlike the 'finite time' model which, when reduced to its essentials, only offers the non-explanation that the universe 'just happened', which is no more philosophically or scientifically satisfactory than saying 'goddidit'.\n \n Onwards...\n \n \n Your philosophy, not mine, and the philosophy that insists that because quarks appear and disappear in this universe, and since, in the materialist view, this universe is the sum total of all existence, that quarks _must_ violate the necessary truth, the fact, the axiom, of \"ex nihilo, nihil fit\", and just spontaneously generate themselves in and out of this sole state of existence, out of a state of nothingness and nowhereness, into something, somewhere, [quarks, here], all by themselves--magically or miraculously, depending on whether you are a materialist or a creationist.\n\n \n Firstly, particle-antiparticle creation-annihilation (or pair production for short) does not involve spontaneous generation from a state of nothingness. Pair production occurs as a result of quantum fluctuations in the ground state energy of a vacuum due to the uncertainty principle. Vacuum energy has been experimentally observed, directly causing the Casimir effect.\n \n So in reference to materialism, if the traditional materialist ontology postulates concepts of 'nothingness' and spontaneous generation, modern physics is definitely waving a big red flag in its direction. Many physicists whose work I have read often consider the philosophical implications of the results of their work; it is fairly common knowledge that most physicists will readily admit that while they understand the results of their experiments and the equations of their theories, understanding the underlying reality is a whole other matter.\n \n Quantum field theory and holographic foam cosmology, for example, offer very strange pictures of the world we live in, even stranger than the tame-by-comparison ordinary (!) quantum mechanics. But physics can only, essentially, provide mathematically predictive models that explain correlation and causation in the physical universe. What it cannot do is tell us, for example, referencing our previous exchange again, what a 'particle' actually is. At least not yet. But I suspect that if this and similar questions are one day answered, they will be replaced with even stranger questions. \n \n \nMy point is that you materialists, assuming that this universe, (this \"space/time\" as you for no good reason choose to call it), announce pompously to us all that this universe is the sum total of all that exists.\n\n \n I have to say that a physicist would see the statement I have emphasised as almost tautological. Anything which could be proven to exist outside of, or beyond, what we colloquially term the 'universe' would have to be taken into account, regardless of the terminology used, for example 'multiverse', 'hyperverse' or 'brane cosmos'. To try to illustate my point; no modern physicist would make such an assumption as \"The 4 dimensional universe of spacetime and mass-energy in which we live is the sum total of all that exists\", but they might say \"All that exists is all that exists\" which is obviously tautological and not worth saying.\n \n I objected in our previous exchange to being labelled a materialist. The topic intrigued me but I distracted myself by banging on about physics, as I have done here, but I think this time more to the point that I would have liked to have made before: The reason I do not like the label 'materialist' is that, even at the time, not fully understanding what materialism claims, I understood that the philosophy must have rigid underlying assumptions which must be adhered to. This is a fundamental premise which I reject, and which physicists must (and do, from what I have read) reject in order to be able to think creatively as well as logically about their science. \n \n If materialism as a philosophy makes such unjustified assumptions, then it is simply incompatible with modern physics, which is now tackling such fundamental questions that it has been forced to reject any assumptions whatsoever in order to find new and better explanations. Our previous discussion was partly concerned with the nature of matter/mass and energy. Current physical theory has some very strange views on this indeed; essentially that mass, energy, fields and forces, even space and time, are all fundamentally interrelated and each can in a way be understood in terms of the others. Unfortunately ordinary language is not capable of satisfactorily describing this; it is only describable in the language of mathematics.\n \n This, I believe, is a fundamental difference between philosophy and science; they both use logic, but they use different languages. Hence when you label me a materialist, and tell me what materialism claims, my reaction from a purely scientific standpoint is simply \"Huh?\" because such a philosophy is not backed up with mathematical logic and therefore is not accurate or specific enough to be used to explain anything.\n \n I should add that I only have the beginnings of knowledge of the maths used for physics but I understand that mathematical logic, if unsound, will always eventually be unpicked by someone, somewhere. Science is a very competitive field, especially physics, given the money that can be made from new advances in theory which actually lead to new technologies. For this reason I choose to accept the areas of physical theory which have mountains of evidence in support of them, and I tentatively accept the more bizarre, newer theories because I trust that either the maths behind them is sound or that it will be shown to be unsound in the future.\n \n A final word on ontology: Obviously physics has its ontology; words such as 'electron', 'quark', 'entropy', all have specific meanings. The problem is that some other words like 'force', 'matter', 'energy', 'universe' have meanings which are hard to use with any accuracy or specificity, because there is no consesus interpretation of the nature of these phenomena, and that interpretation is subject to revision as theory and experimentation progresses.\n \n 'Force' is a great example. Three of the four fundamental 'forces' have experimentally observed 'particles' associated with them, and other areas of physics also say that the vacuum 'energy' is responsible for the four 'forces'. These 'particles' can also exist as 'waves' or 'fields', and the vacuum 'energy' is a 'wave' or a 'field' which can also, under the right conditions, exist as 'particles' (pair production). Gravity is a 'force' which does not have an experimentally observed 'particle' associated with it, but may be just a function of the topology of spacetime, as may be the vacuum 'energy'.\n \n I could go on. The point is that to truly, truly get a grasp of what that last paragraph is about, you (and I) would have to understand the equations, the language of mathematics. \n \n I look forward to your response. I am unused to thinking philosophically; I have always been an \"I want answers! Results! Data! Now!\" kind of guy. \n \n ON EDIT:\n \nMy whole argument has always been that the exact opposite is true--that \"outside the spacetime of our universe\" there is a greater state of existence, and NOT the 'nothingness' or the \"Nothing exists beyond the parameters of our physical universe.\", i.e. , \"Our physical universe is the sole and only thing that exists.\", that is a fundamental ontological postulate of your materialism.\n\n \n Just to sum up: this may be a fundamental ontological postulate of materialism, but it is definitely not a fundamental premise of physical theory, which is beginning to explore theoretically, in fact the theory is starting to demand exploration of, the idea of existence beyond what we colloquially term the 'physical universe'. We may need an entirely new aspect of physics to explore it, and we will be waiting a long time for experimental technology to catch up with theory.",

   "Blimey. This is getting nasty.\n \n That aside, I am intrigued and somewhat perplexed by some of the notions put forward in wabbit's post.\n \n \n \n We have had a brief exchange previously on the subject of the materialist ontology, where I asserted that by your definition of materialism I could not consider myself a materialist, then subsequently changed my mind when I realised I had slightly misunderstood your point.\n \n However again, here, I have to say that I (and the majority of physicists whose works I have read) absolutely do not postulate that either \n 1) something can come from nothing or \n 2) that there exists/has existed a state of \"nothingness\".\n\n \n **\n Absolutely. But my opponents in this thread are not \"the majority of physicists\", (who, as it happens, actually agree with me), but rather a set of darwinist/materialist 'truebelievers' who do in fact 1/ assert that something [quarks, universes] can come from nothing, 'creatio ex nihilo', by 'spontaneous generation', and who 2/ therebye imply that there exists a state of 'nothingness' out of with actual entitities such as quarks and universes can and in fact, do, spontaneously generate themselves. Go back and read their posts if you don't believe me.\n \n \n\n Both of these ideas stem from the origins problem; that existence (in whatever form) must either extend infinitely far into the past or must have had a beginning.\n\n \n **\n Actually the 'problem of existence', by far the greatest problem in metaphysics, is the problem of ontology, which, as some reading this may not know, is the study of the nature of being and existence. Any wishing an easy introduction to the subject can look up 'ontology' at wikipedia.\n \n One branch of ontology is cosmology. Cosmology can be a confusingly equivocal term, since it has both a metaphysical and a physical sense.\n From wordnet.com--\n \"The noun cosmology has 2 meanings:\n \n Meaning #1: the metaphysical study of the origin and nature of the universe\n \n Meaning #2: the branch of astrophysics that studies the origins and structure of the universe\n Synonym: cosmogony\n \n Since cosmogony refers more strictly to the branch of astrophysics that studies the origin and evolution and structure of the universe, it might be useful to distingish the physical issue as cosmogony, and the metaphyical as cosmology. But OTH, maybe not.\n IAC, the issue in this thread is both physical and metaphysical.\n Today, as never before, the physical and metaphysical senses of cosmology overlap and intertwine with one another. There is a wiki entry for cosmology, too.\n \n \n\n Both of these solutions of course present significant logical and conceptual problems. For physicists, these ideas take the following forms:\n \n 'Infinite time' model: Either \n 1) The Big Bang was preceeded by a previous universe which 'recycled' itself into this one; all the major theories concerning the hypothetical fate of the universe (Big Crunch, Heat Death, Big Rip) suggest possibilities for some cyclical process or\n 2) The universe (and others like it?) exists within a higher-dimensional framework; this is the horrifically abstract but apparently mathematically sound Brane Cosmology.\n\n \n **\n Since it is an appeal to magic to claim, contra, 'ex nihilo, nihil fit', that any entity can regenerate itself unaided, i.e., enjoy 'spontaneous regeneration', number one is irrational. I would imagine that only those physicists who cling desperately to materialism give it the least credence.\n \n Number two, OTH, makes perfect sense in principle, although I have no idea what is meant by \"Brane Cosmology\".\n \n \n\n 'Finite time' model: This one is harder to conceptualise, and harder to accept, and much of modern theory is moving away from it, precisely because it suggests that something came from nothing. The basic premise is familiar; that time itself was created in the Big Bang, therefore to speak of anything happening or even existing before it is literally meaningless. But of course this is inconceivable to the human mind. All I can really say in defense of this notion is that many of the well-established facts of relativity and quantum mechanics are pretty much impossible to satisfactorily conceptualise. \n\n \n \n **\n This is, in fact, the position that my opponents in this thread [until you posted here], have all adopted.\n \n \n\n This avenue of thought has yielded very little in the way of answers. Admittedly, the 'infinite time' model is hardly awash with answers, but at least it has provided frameworks for further theoretical exploration, unlike the 'finite time' model which, when reduced to its essentials, only offers the non-explanation that the universe 'just happened', which is no more philosophically or scientifically satisfactory than saying 'goddidit'.\n\n \n **\n Exactly and precisely the point that I've been making throughout this immediate exchange, and many others before it.\n \n \n\n Firstly, particle-antiparticle creation-annihilation (or pair production for short) does not involve spontaneous generation from a state of nothingness. Pair production occurs as a result of quantum fluctuations in the ground state energy of a vacuum due to the uncertainty principle. Vacuum energy has been experimentally observed, directly causing the Casimir effect.\n \n So in reference to materialism, if the traditional materialist ontology postulates concepts of 'nothingness' and spontaneous generation, modern physics is definitely waving a big red flag in its direction.

The topic intrigued me but I distracted myself by banging on about physics, as I have done here, but I think this time more to the point that I would have liked to have made before: The reason I do not like the label 'materialist' is that, even at the time, not fully understanding what materialism claims, I understood that the philosophy must have rigid underlying assumptions which must be adhered to. This is a fundamental premise which I reject, and which physicists must (and do, from what I have read) reject in order to be able to think creatively as well as logically about their science.\n\n \n **\n Yes, isn't it ironic that physicists are the first to reject materialism and physicalism?!? Meanwhile darwinists of the RM+NS persuasion, geneticists, and atheists in general cling to a cosmology and ontology that astrophysicists, and physicists generally, now reject. Of course, everytime a physicists speaks to evolution without toeing the old materialist, darwinist line, he is dismissed as speaking outside of his/her, 'field of expertise'. As if genesis and evolution had neatly delineated dividing lines!!\n \n \n\n If materialism as a philosophy makes such unjustified assumptions, then it is simply incompatible with modern physics, which is now tackling such fundamental questions that it has been forced to reject any assumptions whatsoever in order to find new and better explanations. Our previous discussion was partly concerned with the nature of matter/mass and energy.

If your words entail certain metaphysical assumptions, whether or not you consciously realize that entailment, they are still manifest. In fact, it is the usual case in modern human beings that our unconscious worldviews do not necessarily map accurately to our consciously, analytically arrived at opinions. Many people of the darwinist evolutionary persuasion, that is, the RMNS based explanatiuon of the fact of evolution, constantly make and state opinions that are clearly founded in 19th century materialism. This thread being a case in point. But when you point this out to them, they immediately say that if materialism holds these metaphysical assumptions, then they are not materialists. Their own statements notwithstanding. They simply have never been forced to rigourously examine the roots of what they take for granted. I dare say, without condescention, that this post of yours is a wonderfully refreshing change to the sort of stuff that the others are trying to pass off as mature, reasoned and reasonable, debate. Thank you, and I mean that.\n \n \n\n I should add that I only have the beginnings of knowledge of the maths used for physics but I understand that mathematical logic, if unsound, will always eventually be unpicked by someone, somewhere. Science is a very competitive field, especially physics, given the money that can be made from new advances in theory which actually lead to new technologies.

The point is that to truly, truly get a grasp of what that last paragraph is about, you (and I) would have to understand the equations, the language of mathematics. \n\n \n **\n I disagree. I do not believe that it is necessary to become a top-flight mathematician in order to have an understanding of its most fundamental nature. The basic fundamental dispute, ever since Heraklitus and then Parmenides, has always the dispute between Dynamism/Idealism and Materialism. In the 19th century Materialism reached its zenith. In the 20th century the new physics destroyed it. Certain darwinists and other materialists (Daniel Dennett, the Churchlands, Dawkins, et al) just can't stop trying to prop up its rotting corpse, since materialism is necessary to atheism. Without it we are forced to the conclusion that \"Something\" greater than everything we know or can know exists. But note, this \"Something\", which I tend to characterize as \"G*D\", or, \"The LOGOS\", need have very little resemblance to that anthropomophic old testament superhuman worshipped by creationists.\n \n \n\n Just to sum up: this may be a fundamental ontological postulate of materialism, but it is definitely not a fundamental premise of physical theory, which is beginning to explore theoretically, in fact the theory is starting to demand exploration of, the idea of existence beyond what we colloquially term the 'physical universe'. We may need an entirely new aspect of physics to explore it, and we will be waiting a long time for experimental technology to catch up with theory.\n\n \n **\n And in my own summation, I have no quarrel with physics or astrophysics, except when they go off into fantasy land, (multiverses, and so on), in order to try and defend their materialism against the Strong Anthropic Principle. That is, with a disguised appeal to The Magick of Gret Big Numbers, the same appeal they always use to defend their basic assumption that anything can and will happen, given a large enough number of repetions. Such as adaptive, but entirely random, genetic mutations. And so on.\n \n Thanks again for a great post, and I'm not just saying that because we fundamentally agree with one another.\n \n ww",

God is eternal spiritual reality, but his 'creation', the universe, is a temporal, spatial, physical one, divided and cut off from the eternal reality of its creator. This dualist ontology is irrational, but continues through Plato and Descartes, until the materialists of the \"Enlightenment\" decided that since dualism is irrational, they would arbitrarily dismiss spiritual reality from their ontology, insist that only temporal, spatial, physical reality, i.e., this observable universe, really exists, and that everything else, spiritual, intellectual, and emotional, was nothing but an epiphenomenon of the only real thing--\"matter\". Thus creating a monist, (by decree) ontology, and a heck of a lot of problems with actual phenomena of the living and breathing variety. The evolution issue above all.\n \n Spinoza made a greatstep forward. He is regularly misinterpreted, (IMHO), by materialists who claim he posited a monist position identical to their own, but referred to their 'universe', their 'matter', their 'space/time' if you will, as god himself/herself/itself. That is, an impersonal deist, pantheist 'creator' that is one with, but disinterested in, its own creation.\n My reading of Spinoza disagrees with that interpretation. IMO, Spinoza was a monist, not of the materialist kind, but rather of a pre-platonic, pre-zoroastrian, certainly pre-cartesian, kind. I feel that his ontology held that there is only one reality, true, but not that this universe is the sum total of all of it. Rather, that this universe is but one portion of a much greater reality, and that reality is the sum total of all existence, and that that one great existence that contains our universe within itself, is \"God\". \n Thus Spinoza was, theologically, what I am--not an atheist, not a deist, not an abrahamic theist, not a pantheist, but a panentheist.\n \n Panentheism overcomes the problem of \"creatio ex nihilo\", since all that is 'created', (from 'particles' to universes, to time, and space, and energy, and force, whatever), is a novel expression of the pre-existing and eternal ONE. That which is created, is an integral part of the creator. Thus the created is the creator, and vice versa, and novelty is just a change in form, limited in scope only by the rational nature of the One, which, with Heraklitus, I call \"The LOGOS\". \n \n Thanks for asking an intelligent and pertinent question.\n \n ww",

   "Wascallywabbit, I've hauled this thread out before it disappears because because I am genuinely intrigued and confused by some of the things you say, and by the worldview that seems to lie behind them. I like to think of myself (as I have said before) as not subscribing to any one, even subconscious, worldview. You may well say that this is impossible, and maybe it is, but that is the ideal for which I strive. That said, I'd like to address your points.\n \n \n\n Absolutely. But my opponents in this thread are not \"the majority of physicists\", (who, as it happens, actually agree with me), but rather a set of darwinist/materialist 'truebelievers' who do in fact 1/ assert that something [quarks, universes] can come from nothing, 'creatio ex nihilo', by 'spontaneous generation', and who 2/ therebye imply that there exists a state of 'nothingness' out of with actual entitities such as quarks and universes can and in fact, do, spontaneously generate themselves. Go back and read their posts if you don't believe me.\n\n \n I think one reason for this is that the general, popular perception of big bang theory is that the universe did in fact come from nothing. While this is not the case, most layman's explanations which get rooted in the public consciousness tend to imply this, or leave out the more esoteric details precisely because they are esoteric and also part of a very speculative area of science. (Mathematically speculative as opposed to conceptually speculative that is). I personally don't think that this is a case of anyone deliberately subscribing to a 'materialist' mindset.\n \n \nSince it is an appeal to magic to claim, contra, 'ex nihilo, nihil fit', that any entity can regenerate itself unaided, i.e., enjoy 'spontaneous regeneration', number one is irrational. I would imagine that only those physicists who cling desperately to materialism give it the least credence.\n \n Number two, OTH, makes perfect sense in principle, although I have no idea what is meant by \"Brane Cosmology\".\n\n \n Actually the 'cyclical universe' models do not involve spontaneous regenration either. Anything classed as 'spontaneous' or 'ex nihilo' in physics is deemed very suspect and cannot be included as part of theoretical canon. The cyclical models are simply mathematically plausible ways in which the final state of a given universe can, by virtue of the very properties of that final state, result in the formation of a new universe. The only limitation on the cyclical process is that the 2LoT still maintains that each successive universe, although starting in a low-entropy state, will still have a slightly more entropic initial state than its predecessor.\n \n Brane cosmology is not something I can explain easily (ie without reminding myself by doing a lot of reading!), suffice to say that a 'brane' is the name given by physicists to hypothetical higher-dimensional structures, as a result of whose interactions universes are created and destroyed. As far as I am aware there is no theoretical upper limit to the 'size' or number of these structures.\n \n \nThe important thing is that they deny the fundamental assumption of materialist/mechanist/positivist, and by extension, darwinist, thought.\n\n \n This is where you lose me. I don't understand what 'Darwinism' could be, or how it could be relevant to anything meaningful. If by this term you mean a hardline materialist interpretation of evolutionary theory, I would say that this is because such an interpretation, at the moment, is quite satisfactory in terms of current research. I don't know if you'll accept this, but the whole of modern biochemistry and microbiology is satisfactorily explained by rules and processes derived directly from a selection of physical theories which do not fall under the category of those which challenge hardline materialism. Regardless of their metaphysical background, these theories simply work; they make accurate repeatable predictions.\n \n \nYes, isn't it ironic that physicists are the first to reject materialism and physicalism?!? Meanwhile darwinists of the RM+NS persuasion, geneticists, and atheists in general cling to a cosmology and ontology that astrophysicists, and physicists generally, now reject. Of course, everytime a physicists speaks to evolution without toeing the old materialist, darwinist line, he is dismissed as speaking outside of his/her, 'field of expertise'. As if genesis and evolution had neatly delineated dividing lines!!\n\n \n Again, I'm not being flippant, but I don't know who these 'Darwinists' are supposed to be. And I am intrigued by the last sentence. What do you mean?\n \n \nI disagree. I do not believe that it is necessary to become a top-flight mathematician in order to have an understanding of its most fundamental nature.\n\n \n Here we definitely part ways. I have read a vast amount of layman's (and slightly more technical) physics litearture, and I know that I will never truly appreciate the beauty of physics, or really understand it, without understanding some of the maths involved. I do not believe, for example, that it is possible to explain the details of quantum mechanics with true accuracy using ordinary language. On ocasion, when I have read books which contain both language analogies and the maths, I have strived to make sense of the maths, and succeeded. Those moments have been moments of true understanding, a eureka moment if ever there was one. You can explain the premise of the uncertainty principle with words, but you can't prove its validity without the maths.\n \n \nThe basic fundamental dispute, ever since Heraklitus and then Parmenides, has always the dispute between Dynamism/Idealism and Materialism. In the 19th century Materialism reached its zenith. In the 20th century the new physics destroyed it.\n\n \n I would go one further and say that physics has destroyed both. From my perspective, both materialsim and idealism are equally without future, because no matter what they may say, physics has the facts, which have always been stranger than men have imagined in their nebulous philosophies. Neuroscience is doing the same thing to the Philosophy of Mind, neither confirming or denying it, but replacing it bit by bit with recorded observations, confirmed facts, and well-supported theories. This is why I love science. I truly believe that philosophy as a discipline has been usurped by its child, science. Philosophy by its nature is for those things science cannot yet answer. Philosophies lead to sciences. But then, when questions are answered, the philosophy becomes, while still respected for its achievements, irrelevant in the light of the new understanding of reality.\n \n \n Certain darwinists and other materialists (Daniel Dennett, the Churchlands, Dawkins, et al) just can't stop trying to prop up its rotting corpse, since materialism is necessary to atheism. Without it we are forced to the conclusion that \"Something\" greater than everything we know or can know exists. But note, this \"Something\", which I tend to characterize as \"G*D\", or, \"The LOGOS\", need have very little resemblance to that anthropomophic old testament superhuman worshipped by creationists.\n\n \n Again you lose me. While I happily accept (and, indeed, assume) that there exist things beyond our current scope of knowledge, I do not assume that there exist things beyond our possible future scope of knowledge. I accept that there may exist such things, but if they do, then by definition they hold absolutely no interest for me personally. If I can never know what it is, then any guess I make will probably be wrong, so the exercise is pointless.\n \n \nAnd in my own summation, I have no quarrel with physics or astrophysics, except when they go off into fantasy land, (multiverses, and so on), in order to try and defend their materialism against the Strong Anthropic Principle. That is, with a disguised appeal to The Magick of Gret Big Numbers, the same appeal they always use to defend their basic assumption that anything can and will happen, given a large enough number of repetions. Such as adaptive, but entirely random, genetic mutations. And so on.\n\n \n Just a couple of points to make here:\n \n 1) If you mean Carter's SAP, the statement is a truism. If you mean Barrow and Tipler's SAP, it looks suspiciously like an argument from design which is irrelevant until a designer can be identified.\n \n 2) What you call the Magick of Great Big Numbers is also known as statistics, which is a very logical and easily applied science in the hands of those who know its limitations. \n \n In sum, if I have a worldview, it is that facts are facts and everything else is unknown, ie could be anything, could have any explanation, but that science is the way to know for sure. Philosophies and their implications are irrelevant for me; I am comfortable limiting myself to the body of knowledge which we have attained through science. Anything that is in principle unknowable is irrelevant. We have seen no positive evidence for an intelligent force in the universe, so at the moment such a hypothesis is worthless.\n \n Thoughts?",

It's more an attempt to rescue the discredited 'accordion' model than anything else, and of course it flies in the face of empirical observation. More importantly, this universe is either still the material thing that materialists have always defined it as being, or it is not. If this material universe had a prior, non-material, non-corporeal, non-physical form, then the materialist view is still shot down in flames and they have acheived nothing, because they no longer have any definition or sense of what 'material' or 'universe' even mean anymore, while to persist by saying that this material universe was preceeded by another corporeal universe just doesn't fit the facts, including the 2LoT.\n \n Thus we are set with a material, corporeal, physical universe that did not always exist, had a beginning, and did not arise spontaneously, 'creatio ex nihilo', out of nothingness. \n Sorry, but that's my time for now.

They mean nothing. Even 'the facts' of physics mean nothing. It is not until a mind begins organizing facts and their relationships to one another that meaning, i.e., 'information', arises. Whenever anyone uses facts to build a view of the universe and the reality of existence, be they a toddler or a quantum physicist, they act as philosophers, and their conclusions inform their philosophy, aka, 'worldview'. Or \"weltanschauung\", if we want to wax pedantic. Learning is adapting and adjusting a worldview to new information, as it is assimilated. The problem is that worldviews become so tied to personal or group identity that new information is often resisted, and never assimilated, for fear that one's psychological security, one's culture, one's politico-economic system, even one's sanity, will collapse.\n \n Therefore what modern physics is actually doing is finding the facts that may generate new philosophies. My own philosophy is aligned with the ideas of Alfred North Whitehead (Principia Mathematica), and Charles Saunders Pierce, two men who knew a bit of math. But to say that the recent theories of modern cosmological physics, such as 'many worlds', and 'string theory' and 'brane theory' are any less \"nebulous\" than any metaphysical theory is presumptuous, perhaps even condescending and superior without cause.\n \n \n\n Neuroscience is doing the same thing to the Philosophy of Mind, neither confirming or denying it, but replacing it bit by bit with recorded observations, confirmed facts, and well-supported theories.\n\n \n **\n I don't know what you are trying to say here. The Philosophy of Mind is a field of philosophical enquiry, not some hard and fast set of rules and pronouncements. There is nothing to \"chip away at\", since \"chipping away\" (at ignorance and confusion) is what it is. And as in all philosophy since the arrival of empirical methodology and science, going back to Bacon, observation and testing have informed all metaphysical views. Which is precisely why, except for Dennett, the Churchland's, and Dawkins, materialism is effectively dead as a doornail where philosophers are concerned. I don't know whjat you know of Idealism, but it comes in many flavours and modern physics, far from destroying it as it has materialism, is very much supportive of many Idealist ontologies. It certainly supports my own version of Process Philosophy, with its new approach to dynamism and vitalism.\n \n Anyhoo, gotta go. Later.",

But as a layman you don't see that and assume that everyone in that INDUSTRY is seeking the truth. But here's the rub, THEY ARE NOT. THEY ARE SEEKING TO SUPPORT A PRECONCEIVED OUTCOME AND THAT ISN'T SCIENCE. IT'S A MANUFACTURED BELIEF SYSTEM.\n \n \nAre you including physics, cosmology, geology, nuclear physics, astronomy, paleontology, archaeology and so on in your count? Because there have been some doozy frauds by creationists in other fields of science besides evolutionary biology.\n\n \n No I'm not. And it's discoveries and observations from within all of these other sciences that if you did a research study on, you would find not only contradict, but prove that evolution is a fraud and manufactured belief system. IT MUST BE GREAT TO USE THE EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS ONES SCIENCE AND BURY WHAT DOESN'T, HUH ? Because that is precisely what evo has done since the beginning. If it conflicts with evo they never publish that connection, but if it can be made to appear to, they will market it like it's the missing link.\n \n \nWhat about it? Please tell us about these volumes of scientific evidence. Are you sure that this \"science\" that you wish to believe isn't fraudulent?\n\n \n You're the evolutionist, you check it out. And here's where to look. In the course of reading and watching news releases about scientific discoveries and observations in many branches of science over the years, discoveries and observations have been made that directly fly in the face of evo claims. And after that initial release by the branch that made the discovery, it is never mentioned, catalogued or added to the volumes of info that disproves evo at all. \n \n No one is keeping that file for public consumption. And evo itself has made many many observations and discoveries that conflict with their preconceived notions and in every case, if it can't be fit into their construct of deceit then it is buried never to be referred to again. That sir is the epitome of deceit and fraud.\n \n \nScience is not a question of truth. It is never claimed to be TRUTH. Science tries to explain the observations we make about our universe. It isn't claimed to be the TRUTH, but only the best explanation we can devise based on current evidence. In science, there is always the presumption that the explanation is tentative and subject to adjustment or rejection if new evidence comes to light.\n\n \n Understood, and with legitimate sciences that principle has worked fine and is even necessary for moving forward and remaining open to new discoveries. Why would you think that I don't get that ? But ask yourself this pandion, what if a science is founded on a completely fictional lie ? How can the evidence support that unless it is manufactured from the very beginning ? And that is why i constantly refer to evo as a fraud because it was founded on false assumptions and preconceived notions that are FICTION. Therefor any info gleaned in support of it is false and manufactured.\n \n EXAMPLE: Islam is a 1500 year old cult where as Jehova Witness is less than 100 years old. But just because islam is older and has more members, does that then make it any less a cult ? Not on your life. They are both founded in lies and deceptions. And so it is with evo. It is a cult based in and founded on lies and preconceived notions. And it is followed like a religion by people like you who place all of your faith in it as truth as you kneel at the alter of this fraudulent science. \n \n \nThe problem is that biblical creationism has been shown to be wrong by many fields of science.\n\n \n This too is a lie. If you really possessed the scientific mind that you claim, and had the ability to honestly discern fact from fiction, you would find that in the volumes of real archeological discoveries made in the Holy Land, completely support what is found written in the bible. Completely, 100%. I don't follow fairy tales pandion. I'm not needy or hungry for lies to fill my life. Every one who ever told me about Jesus before receiving Him myself was told hey, I was born a moslem and I'll die a moslem. All the while I wanted to know the living God but I had no desire to convert to Christ. But I met Him and know that He is alive and well and as real as you are. But He is God and now dwells within me. So I'm not believing a man made fairy tale, but you are my friend.\n \n \nThat's just not true. We mock you for your ignorance and hubris. Moreover, you don't even know enough to realize that you are rejecting science in general, not only a single \"branch\" or science, but physics, cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, geology, archaeology, nuclear physics, molecular biology, population genetics, genetics, and more that don't come to mind. What you reject is science itself in that you reject the scientific method.\n\n \n Again with the judgments and assumptions that you cannot reasonably know. I too am a college graduate and understand the principles of evo. But I insist on asking the hard questions that evo doesn't allow a student to ask so I am a heretic of sorts. What you sheeple don't understand is that as long as you follow the party line and never insist on asking these very legitimate questions then evo can never be considered a true and valid science.\n \n \nSince nobody even mentioned that, what are you talking about?\n \n\n \n And yet in every post, you and (or) your ilk mock me as a backward simpleton who must hold onto myths to sustain my insignificant existence in this life. As if believing a lie is better than facing reality. A more shallow and ridiculous argument I can't even imagine, as the truth is everything to me, and the end result of the search I started as a child. \n \n Absolute truth does exist pandion and I've discovered it. And that is what I share here. Everyone who receives it must decide if I'm a liar, a lunatic, or if I have truly met the living God of Creation. That is what is called personal responsibility on your part. accept and receive or deny and reject. The choice is yours, but as for me, I have shared His truth and that is all that matters to me.\n \n \nHow is that meaningful? What does it mean?\n\n \n Again, by swearing allegiance to the religion of evo, you by definition deny the creation account of our existence. All of these who insist that they are good Christians, who happen to accept evo for how we got here will be held accountable for evey person they have supported that lie to someday. You can't have it both ways pandion. God does not compromise with the truth.\n \n \nNo. We mocked you. Your god isn't relevant to the question of science.\n\n \n The only way God is irrelevant to this conversation is if He doesn't in fact exist. Otherwise every attack you make against the truth I speak is spoken against HIM, not me. Because it's his truth I'm sharing with you, not mine.\n \n \nBy the way, Archy. I have a question for you and StuporSport. Why is it that neither of you actually respond to my posts? All you two do is attempt to insult me. Never do you actually respond with anything of substance. What's the deal? Is it that you can't respond due to a lack of knowledge and you are left with nothing more than insult? I think so.\n\n \n I do respond to them directly pandion. The ones worth answering anyway. I answered every statement you made above. But your offensive remarks to me are responded to in kind in many cases. I don't suffer your mockery well at all. But just because you don't like my answers or the direction they take, don't imply that I don't respond directly as it is very disingenuous and false. I accused you correctly of verbal masterbation, and you responded by accusing me of masterbating on the Holy Bible. You tell me which of us made a valid debate point and which of us committed blasphemy ?\n \n \nI'm not actually all that knowledgeable. It's just that I have basic knowledge and the ability to reason and to do research. The result is that you two are reduced to nothing more than insult.\n\n \n That you're not that knowledgeable goes without saying. Then research the truth about evo if you dare. Find the discoveries and observations within Genetic science, Nuclear science and biological science that directly refute what evo claims and then judge for yourself the inconsistencies that it is rife with. Then ask yourself how reliable your chosen religion is and how well placed your faith is ? And if you stop insulting me, I'll stop reminding you how ignorant one must be to believe as you do.\n \n \nOf course, there is always the \"we'll see who's right when you die\" nonsense. But that doesn't address the question.\n \n\n \n Unfortunately, because I can't prove my God through the prism of your scientific microscope, it will only be after death that you will learn the truth. Unless of course you simply ask God to reveal Himself to you within yourself which is the only way to meet the God of life. If you do that, He has promised that \"If you grope out into the darkness, (of this World) I will find you.\" And \"If you seek the Truth, the Truth will set you free.\" So all we are expected to do by our Father is to SINCERELY seek Him. He will find us, open our eyes and allow us to see Him as clearly as we see each other. But His love is so great that He wont force Himself on us. \n \n He also say's \"Behold, I stand at the door of your heart and KNOCK, if any man hears me and opens up the door, I will come into Him, dine with Him and He with me.\" In three simple passages I have given you the complete Gospel and the way to eternal salvation and it has nothing to do with a church, a minister or any man at all. For Jesus said \"I am the Way the Truth and the Life, there is no other way to the Father but through Me.\" Seek and you will find, ask and you will receive, but you either love me or you hate me, those who are lukewarm I will spew out of my mouth. \n \n So He stands at the door now, if one sincerely seeks him and opens the door of their heart He will most assuredly reveal Himself to them.",

I am not aware of that I will immediately take steps to correct your misunderstanding.\n \nAnd since you like crossing over threads let's pick up where you left off running from ours.\nWhere is \"ours?\" What are you talking about?\n \nIf you can't get away with mocking someone you run away like a scared little boy.\nBut pointing out your errors of science, logic, and reality is not mocking. Why do you fundies have to always believe that you are some sort of martyr?\n \nGood, keep twisting what I say. Continue to expose your dishonest style of debating by purposely misinterpreting what is argued while avoiding the real point being made, and not answering it at all.\nI didn't twist what you said. I asked you to show where some fraud by science was exposed by a creationist. Actually, every known fraud by science has been exposed by real scientists. No creationist has ever had the smallest part in exposing a scientific fraud. Show me that I'm wrong and tell us about some.\n \nYes but the glory for furthering the fraud is so great, and things like Tenure and large Grants make the risk worth it.\nDon't be stupid. Are you claiming that all scientists are dishonest? Obviously you don't understand the process of grants or how much money these scientists actually make.\n \nI mean, its all a matter of interpretation anyway.\nNo, it's not. Only if you haven't bothered to educate yourself in the fundamentals could you ever make such a statement. The \"literal\" interpretation of the Bible is a matter of interpretation.\n \nAnd an evolutionary scientist today has a whole industry of other evolutionists who will cover for them because in the end, defeating Creationism and supporting evolution is all that counts.\nDon't be stupid. Every evolutionary scientist today tries to show that other evolutionary scientists are wrong by finding a new explanation for the data. That's how you make a name in your field.\n \nBut as a layman you don't see that and assume that everyone in that INDUSTRY is seeking the truth.\nBut I'm not a layman and no one in science thinks that they are seeking the truth. Science attempts to explain\n \nBut here's the rub, THEY ARE NOT. THEY ARE SEEKING TO SUPPORT A PRECONCEIVED OUTCOME AND THAT ISN'T SCIENCE. IT'S A MANUFACTURED BELIEF SYSTEM.\nThat was a pretty good description of creationism.\n \nNo I'm not. And it's discoveries and observations from within all of these other sciences that if you did a research study on, you would find not only contradict, but prove that evolution is a fraud and manufactured belief system.\nThen present some of those discoveries and observations. This isn't the first time that I have asked, but you always fail.\n \nIT MUST BE GREAT TO USE THE EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS ONES SCIENCE AND BURY WHAT DOESN'T, HUH ?\nExamples, please. Flatulence just doesn't make the grade.\n \nBecause that is precisely what evo has done since the beginning. If it conflicts with evo they never publish that connection, but if it can be made to appear to, they will market it like it's the missing link.\nReally. Give us one example for each of the last 10 years.\n \nYou're the evolutionist, you check it out.\nI am an evolutionist and I have checked it out.\n \nAnd here's where to look. In the course of reading and watching news releases about scientific discoveries and observations in many branches of science over the years, discoveries and observations have been made that directly fly in the face of evo claims.

Observations that conflict with evolutionary biology are being cataloged and studied by evolutionary biologists. Why wouldn't they wish to correct our understanding of reality?\n \nAnd evo itself has made many many observations and discoveries that conflict with their preconceived notions and in every case, if it can't be fit into their construct of deceit then it is buried never to be referred to again.\nAgain, please give an example for each of the last 10 years for any such observation.\n \nThat sir is the epitome of deceit and fraud.\nActually, unless you can offer the examples requested above, your are the epitome of deceit and fraud. Put up or shut up.\n \nUnderstood, and with legitimate sciences that principle has worked fine and is even necessary for moving forward and remaining open to new discoveries.\nSo you are saying that when the science of geology states that the earth is 4.56 billion years old, and that life first appeared 3.8 billion years ago, or when cosmology and astrophysics state that the universe is 13.7 billion years old, you have no problem with that?\n \nWhy would you think that I don't get that ?\nExactly! You don't get it. (No space before a question mark if you are even semi-literate).\n \nBut ask yourself this pandion, what if a science is founded on a completely fictional lie ?\nWhat lie is that? The lie that we can actually learn about our universe?\n .\nHow can the evidence support that unless it is manufactured from the very beginning ?\nsupport what? You are talking babble.\n \nAnd that is why i constantly refer to evo as a fraud because it was founded on false assumptions and preconceived notions that are FICTION.\nSo logic and experimentation are false and preconceived? And somehow, belief in the mythology of two creation stories and a global flood are not? Are you completely daft?\n \nTherefor any info gleaned in support of it is false and manufactured.\nAbsolute tripe!\n \nEXAMPLE: Islam is a 1500 year old cult where as Jehova Witness is less than 100 years old.\nAnd christianity is a 2000 year old cult. So what?\n \nBut just because islam is older and has more members, does that then make it any less a cult ?\nExactly!\n \nNot on your life. They are both founded in lies and deceptions.\nAll three, in fact. Why should we believe otherwise?\n \nAnd so it is with evo. It is a cult based in and founded on lies and preconceived notions.\nName them.\n \nAnd it is followed like a religion by people like you who place all of your faith in it as truth as you kneel at the alter of this fraudulent science.\nNope. Evolution is not my religion. I have never known anyone who thought that a field of science was their religion. I have no faith in science since faith is based on no evidence.

Can you ever actually deal with the truth? Must you always misrepresent?\n \nCompletely, 100%. I don't follow fairy tales pandion.\nYes you do. You think that the two creation stories of the Bible and the flood story are true. Those are both no better than fairy tales if you think they are fact.\n \nI'm not needy or hungry for lies to fill my life.

You call us sheeple? You think that we follow a party line in a profession that rewards the overthrow of accepted theory? Grow up.\n \nAnd yet in every post, you and (or) your ilk mock me as a backward simpleton who must hold onto myths to sustain my insignificant existence in this life.\nYour christian persecution complex is noted. Please show that you are not a simpleton by supporting the assertions above - you know 10 of each.\n \nAs if believing a lie is better than facing reality.\nYou tell me. Is it?\n \nA more shallow and ridiculous argument I can't even imagine, as the truth is everything to me, and the end result of the search I started as a child.\nAnd still childish.\n \nAbsolute truth does exist pandion and I've discovered it. And that is what I share here. Everyone who receives it must decide if I'm a liar, a lunatic, or if I have truly met the living God of Creation.\nAbsolute truth doesn't exist and I'll go with the second option.\n \nThat is what is called personal responsibility on your part.\nDon't be stupid.\n \naccept and receive or deny and reject.\nThen I reject mythology based on ignorance.\n \nThe choice is yours, but as for me, I have shared His truth and that is all that matters to me.\nWell, good for you. The go in peace and stop making yourself look foolish.\n \nAgain, by swearing allegiance to the religion of evo, you by definition deny the creation account of our existence.\nBut my religion isn't evolution. I don't swear allegiance. Please show me some evidence that evolution is wrong. I deny the creation account because it is mythology that only the stupid would believe as literal.\n \nAll of these who insist that they are good Christians, who happen to accept evo for how we got here will be held accountable for evey person they have supported that lie to someday. You can't have it both ways pandion. God does not compromise with the truth.\nYeah, right. Everybody but you is going to hell. How pompous can you be?\n \n I'm going to skip the rest of the clap trap, since none of it is actually of any intelligence to merit a response in the first place. I've wasted my time to this point, but I'm worn out by the hubris and ignorance. The semi-literacy wears on one so much.",

   "\n This is why I love science. I truly believe that philosophy as a discipline has been usurped by its child, science. Philosophy by its nature is for those things science cannot yet answer. Philosophies lead to sciences. But then, when questions are answered, the philosophy becomes, while still respected for its achievements, irrelevant in the light of the new understanding of reality.\n\n \n **\n If you believe that science can be divorced or entirely separated from philosophy, then you understand neither the one nor the other. Even if you actually mean 'metaphysics', when you say, 'philosophy', this remains true. It's like trying to separate 'physics' from 'science'. Science is mostly an epistemological method based upon empiricism, but was turned into 'scientism' when it became confused and conflated with materialist metaphysical assumptions during the 17th century 'Enlightenment', became 'logical positivism', and continued as such until the rise of quantum physics in the 20th century. Then modern science began to smash materialist/logical positivist principles into little bits, and 'scientism/logical positivism', became a discredited metaphysic. Today crypto-logical positivists like Shermer have redefined 'scientism', but without really altering its materialist assumptions and premises. With respect, if you still believe that 'science' is separate reality from 'philosophy', then you are still indulging in 'scientism', a materialist metaphysic.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Certain darwinists and other materialists (Daniel Dennett, the Churchlands, Dawkins, et al) just can't stop trying to prop up its rotting corpse, since materialism is necessary to atheism. Without it we are forced to the conclusion that \"Something\" greater than everything we know or can know exists. But note, this \"Something\", which I tend to characterize as \"G*D\", or, \"The LOGOS\", need have very little resemblance to that anthropomophic old testament superhuman worshipped by creationists. \n \n \n Again you lose me. While I happily accept (and, indeed, assume) that there exist things beyond our current scope of knowledge, I do not assume that there exist things beyond our possible future scope of knowledge. I accept that there may exist such things, but if they do, then by definition they hold absolutely no interest for me personally. If I can never know what it is, then any guess I make will probably be wrong, so the exercise is pointless.\n\n \n **\n If that's your personal choice, then so be it. Just don't criticize and patronize \n those of us who wish to go further in our intellectual inquiries than you do, on the premise that human behaviour is important, and human behaviour is largely determined by what we think we know about the nature of existence.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n And in my own summation, I have no quarrel with physics or astrophysics, except when they go off into fantasy land, (multiverses, and so on), in order to try and defend their materialism against the Strong Anthropic Principle. That is, with a disguised appeal to The Magick of Great Big Numbers, the same appeal they always use to defend their basic assumption that anything can and will happen, given a large enough number of repetitions. Such as adaptive, but entirely random, genetic mutations. And so on. \n \n \n Just a couple of points to make here:\n \n 1) If you mean Carter's SAP, the statement is a truism. If you mean Barrow and Tipler's SAP, it looks suspiciously like an argument from design which is irrelevant until a designer can be identified.\n\n \n **\n What do you mean by \"identified\"? Traced to a name, address, and phone number? This 'identity' argument is a transparent cop-out.\n \n \n\n 2) What you call the Magick of Great Big Numbers is also known as statistics, which is a very logical and easily applied science in the hands of those who know its limitations.\n\n \n **\n Like the bible, anyone can quote 'statistics' to support any point of view. Like Twain said, \"There are lies, there are damn lies, and then there are statistics.\"\n Like many things, statistics are just facts, meaningless until interpreted; and even more than empirical facts, numerical facts (statistics), are extremely easy to misinterpret for ideological reasons. See \"fitness\" and \"natural selection\" and \"population genetics as evolution\", for instance.\n \n \n\n In sum, if I have a worldview, it is that facts are facts and everything else is unknown, ie could be anything, could have any explanation, but that science is the way to know for sure.\n\n \n **\n Depends on what you mean by 'know'. For me, epistemologically-speaking, nothing is \"known\" except the meanings intellectually derived by connecting facts to one another and determining a interrelation, or understanding, via a 'learning' process of 'knowledge' acquisition. We can only be \"aware\" of facts, data;--we 'know' nothing until we establish their correlations. But I admit that some consider 'an awareness remembered' as sufficient to their definition of 'knowledge'. Such as being able to memorize poorly understood sections of text when cramming for an exam.\n \n In sum, facts are merely data, and data are not information.\n \n \n\n Philosophies and their implications are irrelevant for me; I am comfortable limiting myself to the body of knowledge which we have attained through science.\n\n \n **\n Believe this all you like, but you are only deluding yourself.\n \n \n\n Anything that is in principle unknowable is irrelevant.\n\n \n **\n Depends on what you mean by \"unknowable\", and that definition depends upon the metaphysical assumptions you base it upon, whether you recognise them consciously, or not.\n \n \n\n We have seen no positive evidence for an intelligent force in the universe, so at the moment such a hypothesis is worthless.\n\n \n \n **\n Once again, it is your metaphysical presumption that dictates what, for you, constitutes \"positive evidence for an intelligent force in the universe\", and thus enables you to \"see\" none. The mere fact that this universe is a rational, law-abiding, ordered universe in its parts and in their interactions, allows me to infer just such an intelligent force.

As a teen, while still in the indoctrination of the fear of hell, I prayed constantly, asking God to reveal himself, to give me a sign that he existed, to show that what he said in his word was true.

Continue to expose your dishonest style of debating by purposely misinterpreting what is argued while avoiding the real point being made, and not answering it at all.\n \n I didn't twist what you said. I asked you to show where some fraud by science was exposed by a creationist. Actually, every known fraud by science has been exposed by real scientists. No creationist has ever had the smallest part in exposing a scientific fraud. Show me that I'm wrong and tell us about some.\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n Yes but the glory for furthering the fraud is so great, and things like Tenure and large Grants make the risk worth it.\n \n Don't be stupid. Are you claiming that all scientists are dishonest?

The \"literal\" interpretation of the Bible is a matter of interpretation.\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n And an evolutionary scientist today has a whole industry of other evolutionists who will cover for them because in the end, defeating Creationism and supporting evolution is all that counts.\n \n Don't be stupid.

Observations that conflict with evolutionary biology are being cataloged and studied by evolutionary biologists. Why wouldn't they wish to correct our understanding of reality?\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n And evo itself has made many many observations and discoveries that conflict with their preconceived notions and in every case, if it can't be fit into their construct of deceit then it is buried never to be referred to again.\n \n Again, please give an example for each of the last 10 years for any such observation.\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n That sir is the epitome of deceit and fraud.\n \n Actually, unless you can offer the examples requested above, your are the epitome of deceit and fraud.

You are talking babble.\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n And that is why i constantly refer to evo as a fraud because it was founded on false assumptions and preconceived notions that are FICTION.\n \n So logic and experimentation are false and preconceived? And somehow, belief in the mythology of two creation stories and a global flood are not? Are you completely daft?\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n Therefor any info gleaned in support of it is false and manufactured.\n \n Absolute tripe!\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n EXAMPLE: Islam is a 1500 year old cult where as Jehova Witness is less than 100 years old.\n \n And christianity is a 2000 year old cult.

They are both founded in lies and deceptions.\n \n All three, in fact. Why should we believe otherwise?\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n And so it is with evo. It is a cult based in and founded on lies and preconceived notions.\n \n Name them.\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n And it is followed like a religion by people like you who place all of your faith in it as truth as you kneel at the alter of this fraudulent science.\n \n Nope. Evolution is not my religion. I have never known anyone who thought that a field of science was their religion. I have no faith in science since faith is based on no evidence. Science presents evidence and then explains it as best we can.\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n This too is a lie. If you really possessed the scientific mind that you claim, and had the ability to honestly discern fact from fiction, you would find that in the volumes of real archeological discoveries made in the Holy Land, completely support what is found written in the bible.\n \n Please show were I claimed to possess a scientific mind. Can you ever actually deal with the truth? Must you always misrepresent?\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n Completely, 100%. I don't follow fairy tales pandion.\n Yes you do. You think that the two creation stories of the Bible and the flood story are true. Those are both no better than fairy tales if you think they are fact.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n I'm not needy or hungry for lies to fill my life. Every one who ever told me about Jesus before receiving Him myself was told hey, I was born a moslem and I'll die a moslem.\n Then you are more pathetic than I ever imagined.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n All the while I wanted to know the living God but I had no desire to convert to Christ. But I met Him and know that He is alive and well and as real as you are. But He is God and now dwells within me. So I'm not believing a man made fairy tale, but you are my friend.\n I don't really care about your delusions.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n Again with the judgments and assumptions that you cannot reasonably know. I too am a college graduate and understand the principles of evo.\n No, you don't.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n But I insist on asking the hard questions that evo doesn't allow a student to ask so I am a heretic of sorts.\n Then please as those hard questions. We haven't seen them yet.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n What you sheeple don't understand is that as long as you follow the party line and never insist on asking these very legitimate questions then evo can never be considered a true and valid science.\n I'm going to have to get another irony meter! You call us sheeple? You think that we follow a party line in a profession that rewards the overthrow of accepted theory? Grow up.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n And yet in every post, you and (or) your ilk mock me as a backward simpleton who must hold onto myths to sustain my insignificant existence in this life.\n Your christian persecution complex is noted. Please show that you are not a simpleton by supporting the assertions above - you know 10 of each.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n As if believing a lie is better than facing reality.\n You tell me. Is it?\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n A more shallow and ridiculous argument I can't even imagine, as the truth is everything to me, and the end result of the search I started as a child.\n And still childish.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n Absolute truth does exist pandion and I've discovered it. And that is what I share here. Everyone who receives it must decide if I'm a liar, a lunatic, or if I have truly met the living God of Creation.\n Absolute truth doesn't exist and I'll go with the second option.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n That is what is called personal responsibility on your part.\n Don't be stupid.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n accept and receive or deny and reject.\n Then I reject mythology based on ignorance.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n The choice is yours, but as for me, I have shared His truth and that is all that matters to me.\n Well, good for you. The go in peace and stop making yourself look foolish.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n Again, by swearing allegiance to the religion of evo, you by definition deny the creation account of our existence.\n But my religion isn't evolution. I don't swear allegiance. Please show me some evidence that evolution is wrong. I deny the creation account because it is mythology that only the stupid would believe as literal.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Archangel \n All of these who insist that they are good Christians, who happen to accept evo for how we got here will be held accountable for evey person they have supported that lie to someday. You can't have it both ways pandion. God does not compromise with the truth.\n Yeah, right. Everybody but you is going to hell. How pompous can you be?\n \n I'm going to skip the rest of the clap trap, since none of it is actually of any intelligence to merit a response in the first place. I've wasted my time to this point, but I'm worn out by the hubris and ignorance.

That sure doesn't seem like critical thinking to me. Maybe Creationist cult version of \"rational thinking\", but nothing that means anything to an actual person in the real world.",

   "I'm not so sure about that.\n\n \n Respond to this then if you can H_I_M.\n \n Scientific Evidence for a Worldwide Flood\n Part Four of a Five-Part Series on The Age of the Earth.\n \n http://www.earthage.org/EarthOldorYoung/scientific_evidence_for_a_worldwide%20flood.htm \n \n Two Vastly Different World Views, with Vastly Different Conclusions:\n Let's not kid ourselves. What this is all about is whether or not the Old Testament book of Genesis (along with the rest of the Old Testament, and the New Testament) is an accurate account of what happened around 4600 years ago with regard to a worldwide flood, and about 6000 years ago, with regard to Creation itself.\n \n Was virtually all of the sedimentary strata laid down by a single Worldwide Deluge in a short amount of time, or is the evolutionary scenario of slow change, acting over eons of T-I-M-E, and the associated Geological Time Chart (with its millions and millions of years) a more accurate account of Earth history?\n \n It's also about God's future judgment of mankind. That's because Jesus Christ, Himself, related the Great Flood of Noah's day to His own return to earth to reign over it and the people in it. See Luke 17:20-27, 19:11-27; John 5:22-23, 12:32, and Rev. 20:4-15.\n \n Let's Look at the Evidence:\n The following are 18 Evidences of either massive flooding and erosion, extremely rapid layering of strata, or direct evidence of a Worldwide Flood. Such evidences are found in numerous places on virtually every Continent. \n \n Polystrate Fossils: \n One of the strongest pieces of evidence for a worldwide flood is the existence of what Rupke termed \"polystrate fossils.\" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 \n \n Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The \"Fossil Forests\" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 \n \n Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. \n \n Similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada.\n \n And although there is much data on buried trees in the geological literature, most of it is over 100 years old, and difficult to access. One of the few articles on this subject was by Rupke, and in it he comments that:\n \n \"Personally, I am of the opinion that the polystrate fossils constitute a crucial phenomenon both to the actuality and the mechanism of cataclysmic deposition. Curiously a paper on polystrate fossils appears to be a 'black swan' in geological literature. Antecedent to this synopsis a systematic discussion of the relevant phenomena was never published. However, geologists must have been informed about these fossils. In view of this it seems unintelligible that uniformitarianism has kept its dominant position.\" 12\n \n With regard to Rupke's observation, I suspect the reason why such is (still) the case has more to do with one's personal bias against the concept of a Creator / God to whom we might very well have to give account than to the ever-mounting evidence against the theory of evolution and the millions of years old Earth that it requires (to appear plausible). However, T-I-M-E is simply not enough: not even BILLIONS of years of it.\n \n See also The Organic Levels of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest 13 and The Yellowstone Petrified \"Forests\" 14 by Harold Coffin.\n \n The Fossils Themselves: \n Fossils don't form on lake bottoms today, nor are they found forming on the bottom of the sea. 15 Instead, they normally only form when a plant or animal is buried soon after it dies. 16 Therefore, the fossils themselves are evidence of a catastrophe such as a flood or volcanic eruption that took place in the past. See also Rapid Petrification of Wood, by Andrew Snelling.\n \n Clastic Dikes: According to Austin, a clastic dike is \"a cross cutting body of sedimentary material which has been intruded into a foreign rock mass.\" 17\n \n \"These dikes...(may) penetrate horizontal sedimentary strata (or) they may occur... in igneous and metamorphic rocks. The process of formation of a clastic dike is analogous to wet sand oozing up between ones toes, but on a much larger scale.\" 17\n Clastic dikes present a problem to the \"mythions of years\" mindset of evolution in that massive \"older\" sediments are found intruding up into overlying younger strata. This must have occurred while the \"older\" sediments were still in a plastic state. \n \n What took these \"older\" sediments so long to become hard?\n \n One would think that a million years would be more than enough time to turn massive sand laden sediments into sandstone, yet we have an example of sediments which are said to be 80 million years older than those above them, and yet they still had not become hard, but were in a wet and plastic state when an earth movement caused them to be forced up into the (supposedly much) \"younger\" sediments. Such things not only present serious problems for the evolutionary method of \"dating\", but also tell us that something is wrong with the millions of years mindset of evolutionary theory itself, and thus cause strongly suspicion that we are not being told the truth by the mass media, nor the \"Scientific\" community of believers in evolution. 17,18,19 \n \n Mt. St. Helens: \n Three separate eruptions produced sedimentary-type layers hundreds of feet thick. One of these was a hurricane velocity deposit that produced thousands of thin laminations up to 25 feet thick 10,11,12 The third eruption was a lava flow, which turned into a hot mud-flow as it crossed the Toutle River. This hot mud flow not only diverted the river, but carved a 17 mile long series of canyons (up to 140 feet deep) in a matter of hours. They call it the Little Grand Canyon of the Toutle River.\" 20,21,22 And to this very day, the neither the mass media, nor any popular \"science\" publications have told the public what happened. 23 For more on this see Mt. St. Helens: Evidence in Support of Biblical Catastrophe.\n \n Palouse Canyon: \n In Eastern Washington State there is a canyon that was eroded through solid basalt by Lake Missoula floods in 1-2 days. This canyon is 300 to 500 feet deep. See references below for more information. 24,25,26,27,28 \n \n Observations at an Australian Beach: \n At Greenmount Beach on the Gold Coast of Queensland, an interesting thing occurred: \"clear laminations, or layering, in the sand--formed by the separation of normal silica-sand grains and smaller, denser mineral sand-grains such as rutile which are dark in color.. The layering was present along the whole sand mass exposed.\" 29 Emphasis Added\n \n \"This was produced as a result of a beach restoration project (which involved) the dredging of sand from (a) sand bar (on) the Tweed River and carrying it by ship several kilometres north to the southern Gold Coast beaches, where it was pumped ashore as a water/sand slurry through a large pipe to the beach.\" 29 See also Talking About Geology / Varves. 30 Emphasis Added\n \n Spontaneous Sorting of Layers: \n Laboratory experiments have shown that spontaneous sorting and layering occurs with a sand, mud and clay slurry. When the mixture slows down, the sand, mud and clay will spontaneously precipitate (settle out) and form individual layers. Dr. Guy Berthault has performed a number of experiments which demonstrate this. 31,32,33 Those who wish to see for themselves, may do so by simply ordering one of the following videos : Evolution: Fact or Belief? Or Experiments in Stratification. \n \n Turbidity Currents: \n A turbidity current is an underwater mud flow, the discovery of which caused somewhat of a revolution in geology. As a result, many sedimentary strata layers throughout the world have been reevaluated and found to be turbidites. 34,35,36,37,38,39,40\n \n For example, regarding turbidites and the impact they are having on modern Geology, Kurt Howard, 41 said the following in his paper on this topic: \n \n My physical geology professor said, \"Regarding uniformitarianism, you can take it with a grain of salt.\" After reviewing geology texts on the subject of turbidites, I am following the courageous professor's advice. To paraphrase his words, I am taking uniformitarianism with a grain of sand, for the philosophy of uniformitarianism states that sedimentary layers form over many millions of years, while ... recent research has shown that turbidites form within a few hours. {1} Emphasis Added\n \n In 1972 Burgert identified several lower basal Tapeats units as turbidites in Grand Canyon's Cheops Bay. Dr. Ariel Roth a geologist at Loma Linda University's Geoscience Institute, suggested that 30% of all sedimentary rocks in Grand Canyon are turbidites. Some geologists suggest that 50% of the world's sedimentary rocks might be turbidites. Emphasis Added\n \n Modern geologists discarded the terms flysch sediments and geosyncline because rapidly formed megathick flysch is incompatible with uniformitarianism and long ages. However, in the last few years, the number of geologists abandoning the classical uniformitarian discipline and adopting the new catastrophism is almost a shock to ... creationists. Geologists are finally beginning to grudgingly agree with ... creationists about the nature of the stratigraphic record, which is a record of major catastrophic events and not the slow year-by-year buildup suggested by uniformitarianism. Flysch deposits might be the sedimentary results of a global flood. The idea of geosynclines is unpopular because most geologists believe in plate tectonics. Emphasis Added\n \n Extensive Strata and Pancake Layering: \n As we observe sedimentary strata throughout the world we see almost everywhere flat-lying (or \"pancake\") layered strata. Many of these layers are so extensive that they cover several states. Evolutionists believe that such layers were deposited slowly over millions and millions of years, or that they are simply \"river\" deposits or river deltas. 42,43 Creationists, and a growing number of geologists see problems with such interpretations. 44,45 First because there is virtually no evidence of erosion between the layers, and second, because the sheer size and extent of the strata suggests that the layers were neither formed by rivers, or river deltas. That's because many of the \"layers\" are quite thick, and cover (literally) hundreds and even thousands of square miles, and in many instances are the size of the state of Utah, or even larger.\n \n This, coupled with the presence of marine fossils that are buried in many of the layers, tells us that they were deposited by ocean currents (i.e. from a major, major Flood), like nothing we have ever seen before.\n \n We can say for certain that it was the ocean (as opposed to a lake) because of the marine fossils that are buried in much of this strata. For example, in the Grand Canyon area itself, old Earth geologists have said that the Ocean swept over the whole area on six different occasions. Young Earth geologists say it was probably only once.\n \n A \"Whale\" of a Fossil: \n Or should we say \"a fossil of a whale? It's true, but what is most interesting about it is how it was buried. In 1976, workers from the Dicalite division of Grefco inc. found the remains of a baleen whale entombed vertically in a diatomaceous earth quarry. \n \n \"They've found fossils there before; in fact the machinery operators have learned a good deal about them and carefully annotate any they find with the name of the collector, the date, and the exact place found. Each discovery is turned over to Lawrence G. Barnes at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The Whale, however, is one of the largest fossils ever collected anywhere... (It) is standing on end.. and is being exposed gradually as the diatomite is mined. Only the head and a small part of the body are visible as yet.\n \"The modern baleen whale is 80 to 90 feet long and has a head of similar size, indicating that the fossil may be close to 80 feet long. 46,47\n \n More Fossil Whales:\n \n \"In bogs covering glacial deposits in Michigan, skeletons of two whales were discovered ... How did they come to Michigan in the post-glacial epoch? Glaciers do not carry whales, and the ice sheet would not have brought them to the middle of a continent... Was there a sea in Michigan after the glacial epoch, only a few thousand years ago?\" 48\n \"Bones of Whale have been found 440 feet above sea level, north of Lake Ontario; a skeleton of another whale was discovered in Vermont, more than 500 feet above sea level; and still another in the Montreal-Quebec area, about 600 feet above sea level...\" 48\n \n Marine Fossils In The Mountains: \n In Mountains all over the world one can find sea shells and other marine fossils. These include the Sierras, the Swiss Alps, the Himalayas and many more. 49,50,51,52,53 For more on this subject see the following video 54 by Dr. Walter Brown.\n \n Frozen Mammoths: \n Frozen mammoths and Mammoth bones are found in large numbers in Siberia, Alaska, and Northern Europe. Some of these were in such good preservation that Eskimos would feed their dogs meat from them when they became exposed due to melting ice and snow: that is, if wolves didn't get their first. For those who want to know more see: Frozen Mammoths. \n \n Fissures In The Rocks: \n In caves and fissures in England and Whales and all over western Europe are found bones and bone fragments of many types of extinct and extant animal species -- including the mammoth, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, horse, polar bear, bison, reindeer, wolf and cave lion. In virtually every case, the bones are disarticulated, without teeth marks, un-weathered, and in most cases broken and splintered. 55\n \n \"In the rock on the summit of Mont de Sautenay -- a flat-topped hill near Chalonsur-Saone between Dijon and Lyons -- there is a fissure filled with animal bones. 'Why should so many wolves, bears, horses, and oxen have ascended a hill isolated on all sides?' asked Albert Gaudry, professor at the Jardin des Plantes. According to him, the bones in this cleft are mostly broken and splintered into innumerable... fragments and are 'evidently not those of animals devoured by beasts of prey; nor have they been broken by man. Nevertheless, the remains of wolf were ... abundant, together with those of cave lion, bear, rhinoceros, horse, ox, and deer... Prestwich thought that the animal bones... were found in common heaps because, '... [they] had fled [there] to escape the rising waters.'\" 55,56\n \n Erratic Boulders: \n All over Europe and North America are found extremely large \"boulders\" which were transported many miles by some mysterious force -- the most likely of which is a massive flood that swept over the Continents. Concerning these Velikovsky writes : \n \n \"Some erratics are enormous. The block near Conway, New Hampshire, is 90 by 40 by 38 feet and weighs about 10,000 tons, the load of a large cargo ship. Equally large is Mohegan Rock, which towers over the town of Montville, in Connecticut. The great flat erratic in Warren County, Ohio, weighs approximately 13,500 tons and covers three quarters of an acre; the Ototoks erratic, thirty miles south of Calgary, Alberta, consists of two pieces of quartzite 'derived from at least 50 miles to the west,' [and weighs] over 18,000 tons.\" 57\n \n Was the Flood Local or Worldwide? \n In the late 60's and early 70's:\n \n \"Two American oceanographic vessels pulled from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico several long, slender cores of sediment. Included in them were the shells of tiny one-celled planktonic organisms called foraminifera. While living on the surface, these organisms lock into their shells a chemical record of the temperature and salinity of the water. When they reproduce, the shells are discarded and drop to the bottom. A cross-section of that bottom ... carries a record of climates that may go back more than 100 million years. Every inch of core may represent as much as 1000 years of the earth's past.\" 58 Emphasis Added\n \n \"The cores were analyzed in two separate investigations, by Cesare Emiliani of the University of Miami, and James Kennett of the University of Rhode Island and Nicholas Shackleton of Cambridge University. Both analyses indicated a dramatic change in salinity, providing compelling evidence of a vast flood of fresh water into the Gulf of Mexico. Using radiocarbon, geochemist Jerry Stripp of the University of Miami dated the flood at about 11,600 years ago.\" 1 To Emiliani, all the questions and arguments are minor beside the single fact that a vast amount of fresh melt water poured into the Gulf of Mexico. 'We know this,' he says, 'because the oxygen isotope ratios of the foraminifera shells show a marked temporary decrease in the salinity of the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. It clearly shows that there was a major period of flooding from 12,000 to 10,000 years ago... There was no question that there was a flood and there is no question that it was a universal flood. 58 Emphasis Added\n \"Emiliani's findings are corroborated by geologists Kennett and Shackleton, who concluded that there was a 'massive inpouring of glacial melt water into the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River system. At the time of maximum inpouring of this water, surface salinities were... reduced by about ten percent.\" 58\n \n \n The Black Sea Speaks:\n \n \"Science... has found evidence for a massive deluge that may ... have inspired Noah's tale. About 7,500 years ago, a flood poured ten cubic miles of water a day -- 130 times more than flows over Niagara Falls - from the Mediterranean Sea into the Black Sea, abruptly turning the formerly freshwater lake into a brackish inland sea.\" 59 Emphasis Added\n \n \"In 1993, William Ryan and Walter Pitman of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory dug up cores of sediment from the bottom of the Black sea. The cores showed that the sea's outer margins had once been dry land, indicating it had been two-thirds its present size. Furthermore, over the entire sea bottom was a thin, uniform layer of sediment that could only have been deposited during a flood. The researchers also found that within that layer saltwater mollusks appear, all from the Mediterranean and all dating from around 7600 years ago.\" 59 Emphasis Added\n \n \n Miracle or Worldwide Flood?\n \n \"Such a hypothesis would require assumption of a highly unlikely pattern of faunal migrations, where swarms of species of Manticoceras are followed, everywhere at the same distance and the same time interval, by swarms of species of Cheiloceras, the two waves preserving their separate identities on a staggered mass migration around the world ... without evolutionary changes and without ever becoming mixed...\" 60 Emphasis Added\n \n \"It would be easy to repeat this investigation for almost every critical zone fossil or fauna throughout the geological column for hundreds, perhaps thousands of... cases. The conclusions would be the same. In the words of Jeletsky (1956) we would have to 'invoke a miracle', if, for example, we were to assume anything but world-wide contemporaneous deposition for each of the 55 ammonite zones of the Jurassic. Not all of them occur everywhere, but wherever two or more are found in superposition they occur in the same order. 60 Arkell (1957, p. L112) 61 summarized the picture of ... Mesozoic ammonoids as follows: Emphasis Added\n \n 'Evolution is above all very uneven. Certain periods were outstandingly productive of new and verile forms which often seem to have sprung into existence from nowhere ... and to have become dominant almost simultaneously over a large part of the world ... \n \n How such sudden multiple creations were brought about is a task for the future to determine.'\" 60,61 Emphasis added \n \n \n Worldwide Chaos and Out of Order Fossils:\n The following excerpts provide further evidence that something is amiss with the Geological Time Chart and the associated Theory of Evolution itself.\n \"I regard the failure to find a clear 'vector of progress' in life's history as the most puzzling fact of the fossil record.\" 62 \n \n And that:\n \n \"Heretofore, we have thrown up our hands in frustration at the lack of expected pattern in life's history -- or we have sought to impose a pattern that we hoped to find on a world that does not really display it... If we can develop a...theory of mass extinction, we may finally understand why life has thwarted our expectations, and...extract an unexpected ... pattern from apparent chaos.\" 62 Stephen Jay Gould Emphasis added.\n \n \"One of the ironies of the evolution-creation debate is that the creationists have accepted the mistaken notion that the fossil record shows a detailed and orderly progression...\" 63 David M. Raup Emphasis added.\n \n \"only 15-20% of the earth's land surface has even 3 geologic periods appearing in 'correct' consecutive order.\" 64 John Woodmorappe Emphasis added \n \n \"Any sequence in which an older fossil occurs above a younger one is stratigraphically disordered ... disorder may be from millimeters to many meters ... (and) is produced by the physical or biogenic mixing of ... sediments ... Since these processes occur to an extent in virtually all sedimentary systems, stratigraphic disorder at some scale is probably a common feature of the fossil record.\" 65 Emphasis Added \n \n \"The extent of disorder ...is not well documented; however, the widespread occurrence of anomalies ... suggest that disorder should be taken seriously...\" ref. 61 p. 234. W. J. Arkell. Emphasis added \n \n \"Examination of Britain's record of the Ice Age levels discloses a 'complex interbedding of drift sheets derived from different sources.' 'When we add the additional complications imposed by thin drifts, scanty interglacial deposits, and the frequent presence in fossil-bearing beds of secondary [displaced] fossils derived from the reworking of older horizons, we get a truly difficult overall problem ... All in all, British glacial stratigraphic research has encountered exceptional difficulties,' writes R. F. Flint, professor of geology at Yale University. 66,67 Immanuel Velikovsky Emphasis added\n \n A Note about \"Problematica\": \n \"Problematica\" is the \"code word\" Paleontologists use to describe out of order fossils, or those that are not easily placed, or that are \"mixed\" in with one's they shouldn't be with. \n \n If one were to perform an internet search on this word he or she may be surprised at how many web pages there are on it: especially considering that the word isn't even in the Dictionary: at least not an English one. \n For more on this see: Sea-Sloths and Out of Order Fossils. \n \n For those seeking more information on this Worldwide Flood which almost certainly did occur, or how a Boat with Thousands of Animals onboard could possibly have survived Here is a link that may answer some of your questions.

   "Oreo, I'm a graduate of Bible College so have studied every objection you can raise. I have also studied the historical and irrefutable evidence for what I believe.\n\n \n But the historical and genetic evidence screams \"Evolution!\" Scientists have a bible of sorts that they respect -- it's called \"the published literature\". There are several important differences between it and your bible. For one thing, the scientific literature is heavily weighted towards fact-based content as opposed to faith-based exhortation and stories. Scientists are expected to provide evidence for their theories, and don't expect them to be accepted on faith alone. For another, it's a constantly growing, constantly revised body of literature, because scientists keep improving expanding their factual knowledge and theory. Thirdly, scientific literature thrives on skepticism, not credulity. It's tested constantly, often to destruction when falsified theories are discarded.\n \n I'm happy you have infallible faith in your infallible bible, but where history and reality are concerned, I have more faith in science. People who have faith in a literal interpretation of the bible, who worship it as if it were a god, or who treat it as a science text, are closing the door on the truth about nature.

One of the major stupidities ubiquitous among you darwinians is your inability to distinguish the conservation of traits over generations, (i.e., _inheritance_, which is usually, but not always, a genetic function), from the generation of novel organismic traits, (i.e., _evolution_, which is seldom, if ever, a genetic function). By analogy, darwinists cling to the transparenly moronic belief that if you drop and break a great big number of the clay pots used to carry water, eventually a better, (for instance, shatter-proof), water-carrying pot will spontaneously generate itself. You geneticists will then do as you have just done, and claim that biologists recognise the shatter-proof qualities of the pot, and that knowledge of that property explains, all by itself, how that property originated.

It is not observations of traits, but explanations for their origins and persistence over generations that concerns biology.

(see darwinian definition of 'evolution').\n If natural selection is seen as the cause of evolution, then it must be proven to be a universal force of such regularity in its effects that a/the cause is distinct from the effect, the one is not the other, and the one cannot be confused for the other, and b/the cause is a single, unitary, universal, alocal force whose regularity and constancy enable scientific study and prediction.\n You people have never supplied any proff for B/, but simply refer to A/ as proof of B/. That's called sophistry. It's also called duplicity and deception.\n \n Until such time as you can and do supply some honest proof for B/, natural selection will remain an unproven speculation that for that very reason is set apart from disproof.

Berg\n \n Summary of this Paper\n \n Fossil trees are found on virtually every continent. Sometimes they are found lying prostrate on, or upright (and extending) above the surface of the ground; however, in most cases such trees are buried entirely within the strata itself, in either prostrate, oblique, or upright positions. When many upright trees are found in one location, they may be termed a \"fossil forest.\" In the United States alone such forests have been found in Alabama, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia. Similar deposits are also found in Europe, most notably England, Germany and France. However, the most extensive such \"forests\" in North America are in Western Nova Scotia, near the town of Joggins. Here, along the coast of the Bay of Fundy, approximately 14,000 feet of sedimentary strata is exposed in the face of the cliffs with large sections containing upright fossil plants and trees. Very similar deposits are also in Northern Nova Scotia along the coast near the town of Sydney, and, to a lesser extent, in other parts of the Province. The beds at Joggins and Sydney consist mainly of alternating layers of sandstones, shales, coals and coaly shales, along with mudstones, and (less frequently) limestones, and clays. In many cases argillaceous material (i.e. clay) is mixed in with the shales and sandstones. \n \n This paper examines (or rather re-examines) various individual sections of the Joggins and Sydney strata that were (at their time of publication) said to represent in situ forests which were inundated again and again by what are often referred to as localized \"river\" floods.\n \n The evidence presented herein suggests that the upright fossil plants and trees found in the Nova Scotia strata were not buried in their original places of growth, but rather were uprooted by catastrophic influences, transported and re-deposited by water in this location, perhaps (if not likely) via a single event such as a Worldwide Flood. Evidence is also presented, both for and against the allochthonous and autochthonous theories of coal formation. This evidence suggests that the long-held autochthonous (in situ) theory for the accumulation of this coal may be incorrect. \n \n \n Introduction : \n For the past 150 years the Nova Scotia strata has been interpreted by most geologists as in situ continental deposits laid down on river flood plains. According to some, such an interpretation is \"too restrictive\" and others (such as myself) believe that this view is completely incorrect. One of the first things which led me to question this interpretation were the drawings themselves. It seemed strange to suggest that many of the fossil trees have \"extensive root systems\" yet the pictures and drawings of them do not.\n \n The term polystrate fossil 1 is sometimes now used to describe fossil trees that are upright, in relation to the surrounding strata. Such trees quite often traverse multiple layers of horizontally deposited strata - including sandstones, shales, and occasionally even coal seams. 2 Upright plant fossils range in size from small rootlets, to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Nova Scotia, has perhaps more upright fossil trees and plants than any place on earth. At Joggins alone, erect trees and plants occur at over 50 \"levels\" scattered throughout 7,500 feet of strata; 4 erect roots and rootlets occur at many more \"levels.\" 4 Drifted plants and trees also occur in many sections of this strata. These drift deposits are scattered over more than 10,000 vertical feet of strata.4,5,6 Most of the upright fossil trees at Joggins are from 2-15 feet in length. The longest was 40 feet.7 Many, if not most, of the upright fossil trees at Joggins have little or no visible traces of roots.8 In addition, many of the larger Stigmaria roots are missing their rootlets,3 and many (if not most) rootlets are buried individually: unattached to any tree, or larger root.8, 9 Fragile fossils such as leaves are also common in the Joggins and Sidney strata.10 Animal tracks, insects, and rain marks are also (sometimes) found here although they are not nearly as common. The strata at Sydney is also said to be very similar to that of Joggins. 11\n \n \n Lack of Interest : \n Although there is a significant amount of data on buried trees and tree stumps in the geological literature, much of it is from the 1800's and difficult to access, and the only booklets available on the subject of fossil trees are in German.12 One of the few articles on this topic was written by Rupke. In it he remarks that:\n \n \"...I am of the opinion that the polystrate fossils constitute a crucial phenomenon both to the actuality and the mechanism of cataclysmic deposition. Curiously a paper on polystrate fossils appears to be a 'black swan' in geological literature. Antecedent to this synopsis a systematic discussion of the relevant phenomena was never published. However, geologists must have been informed about these fossils. In view of this it seems unintelligible that uniformitarianism has kept its dominant position.\"13 **\n An example of this knowledge is provided in the writings of Schrock. Consider his comment below:\n \n \"No attempt has been made to compile an extensive bibliography on the subject of buried stumps, trees, and similar structures, but the following references contain the essential literature: ...\" 14 \n And while Schrock did provide a number of valuable references that were used in the preparation of this paper, they are nevertheless only a small portion of the available data on this subject.\n \n \n Are Present Deposition Rates the Key to the Past?\n The a priori assumption of many geologists is that the massive flat-lying, sheet-like, sedimentary deposits which are stacked, one upon the other, and found throughout the world took hundreds of millions of years to deposit. However, such a hypothesis (known as uniformitarianism) is inadequate to account for much, if not most, of the fossil-bearing strata. Some people, who pride themselves as truth-seeking men and women of science, seem to think that they must, at all costs, force-fit their conclusions so that they always fall into an evolutionary / semi-uniformitarian / Old Earth philosophy. Others pretend as if they won the debate long ago, and that it should \"hereafter never.. be questioned\". 15 Unfortunately for the cause of science, this has resulted in an almost paranoia of writing anything that remotely resembles a catastrophic viewpoint. For to do so might subject one to ridicule, risk alienating colleagues, and perhaps endanger one's very career in the field of evolutionary thought - also often referred to as \"science. In other words, an evolutionary view, no matter how unscientific it may be, is the only opinion that will be allowed into this debate with regard to our origin. Therefore an Old Earth is absolutely imperative if evolutionary theory is to remain viable; and those who challenge it are usually labeled enemies of \"science,\" or \"religious\" fanatics in an attempt to quickly dismiss the data, and the debate itself, no matter how valid the contrary evidences may be. For if the Time-curtain is lifted all can (and likely will) see that the evolutionary house must be torn down -- leaving the entire scientific community with nothing at all to say regarding our origins, and therefore greatly reducing their (priest-like) position of societal influence.\n \n Therefore, in an attempt to quell the debate, the only type of floods that are allowed in most of the \"scientific\" literature today are small localized ones. Thus, the sedimentary strata from the Coal Measures of Nova Scotia are often said to have taken many millions of years to deposit. For example, consider the following proclamation by Ferguson with regard to the Joggins strata:\n \n \"These layers of sediment were originally laid down more or less horizontally but are now tilted to the south at an angle of about 20 degrees...\" with \"the top of the layers to the south, so as you walk northwards up the beach towards Lower Cove you are actually passing by progressively older rocks, retracing the earth's history perhaps hundreds or thousands of years with every step.\" 16 **\n \n Sir William J. Dawson, (sometimes referred to as John W. Dawson) was the author of Acadian Geology. Dawson's book provides us with what is perhaps the most detailed description of the Joggins strata in print. It was first published in 1855. Later editions followed. Dawson was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Sir Charles Lyell, and although he was a Christian who believed in a Creator and who rejected the philosophy of evolution apart from Divine intervention, he nevertheless did accept the theory of uniformitarianism, and taught that many of the upright trees at Joggins and Sydney were entombed in their original positions of growth.\n \n \n \n Examples of Upright Trees from the Joggins area:\n The drawing below shows an erect tree overlying the Joggins Main Coal seam. 17 This is the only tree from the Joggins area that Dawson depicted which also has attached roots. Details with regard to its burial and their implications are discussed below. \n \n \n \n 1. Shale and sandstone. Plants\n with Spirorbis attached; \n Rainmarks (?)\n 2. Sandstone and shale, 8 feet.\n Erect Calamites.\n 3. Gray sandstone, 7 feet.\n 4. Gray shale, 4 feet.\n 5. Gray sandstone, 4 feet.\n 6. Gray shale, 6 inches. Prostrate\n and erect trees, with rootlets;\n leaves; Naiadites; Spirorbis \n on the Plants.\n 7. Main coal-seam, 5 ft. in two\n seams.\n 8. Underclay, with rootlets. (An\n erect coniferous-? tree, rooted\n on the shale, passes up \n through 15 feet of the sand-\n stones and shale.) p. 198\n \n \n \n \n \n Discussion: \n The 15 foot Tree: The most obvious evidence for rapid burial is the tree itself: that it was buried before it had time to decay, and that its top is just as well-preserved as its base. The roots are about two feet long and appear to be truncated. The fact that its top was broken off is a clear indication it was taller, perhaps by another 5-10 feet. The fact that its roots appear to be truncated suggests that it may have been uprooted from its original place of growth, and re-deposited here in this strata. Note also that this tree was thought by Dawson to be coniferous. Such trees (at Joggins) are almost always found in \"drift\" strata, and are discussed in greater detail in Part Two of this paper.\n \n Although it is possible that the roots of this tree were not broken off, but only appear that way because the cliff-face below the tree may have fallen out. However, if this were the case we would expect Dawson to have said so. We would also (still) expect to see small rootlets below the tree, yet these are also missing. This suggests either that there were no rootlets present or that Dawson omitted them. However, since he did record such rootlets in the underclay of level 8, and in other drawings it seems unlikely that he would have omitted them in this instance unless there were none to record.\n \n The Calamites: Calamites are extinct segmented plants similar to Equisetum (or Horsetail). Virtually all of the Calamite fossils at Joggins are preserved as sandstone casts. In some cases the outer \"bark\" appears as a thin layer of carbonaceous material. The fact that Calamites are preserved as casts is an indication that they had hollow interiors. In the 1855 edition of Acadian Geology, four of the Calamites are depicted with their lower parts missing. This suggests that the Calamites also may not be in their original positions of growth but rather were part of the (marine) drift deposit of section 1. It also suggests that later drawings of this section were altered to give the in situ interpretation for the Joggins strata, and thus for the autochthonous theory of Coal formation (which requires and Old Earth) a greater degree of acceptance.\n \n Note: It is entirely possible the later altered drawings (from 1868 on) were simply an innocent mistake; however, it is also possible that Dawson both knew about it and/or approved of the changes. This may also be the reason for his (seemingly) arbitrary division between the \"Shale and sandstone\" of section 1, which contained drift-plant fragments (although they are not depicted in his drawing) from the \"Sandstone and shale\" of section 2.\n \n Lack of Distinct Soils: There is an absence of a distinct soil in sections 2 and 4, where the Calamites and the tree roots are entombed. This is indicated by an almost complete uniformity of the surrounding sediments, and by the fact that they are layered.\n \n Horizontal Strata: The fact that this strata displays a high degree of lateral continuity suggests that there was little time between deposition of the layers. Even if only a few years separated each layer then we would expect to see evidence of this in the form of erosion between the layers. The fact that we don't see this suggests there was very little time between the deposition of these lamina -- perhaps only minutes. 18\n \n Extremely Thick \"Layers\": The fact that sections 3 and 5 are not stratified, but rather composed of a single, homogeneous \"layer\" is a clear indication of rapid deposition. The \"layer\" in section 3 is seven feet thick. The fact that the tree crosses the entire layer negates the possibility that it was deposited slowly over hundreds or thousands of years. This strongly suggests that these (two) layers were probably laid down in a very short period of time -- perhaps only a few minutes or hours. \n \n The Coal: Although it is not apparent from the picture above (from Schrock, ref. 14), the coal in the main seam is also layered (or stratified ) -- an indication that the coal itself was also deposited as sedimentary layers of decayed plant or animal remains. This layering is clearly evident in the detailed view of this drawing. 19, 20 \n \n If this coal was formed as a result of multiple forests, then we should see evidence of this in the form of bioturbation -- which would (in theory) erase and/or prevent stratification (or layering). This is what Dawson said with regard to the \"underclays\" 21 so why should it not apply to the coals as well. Furthermore, if this coal resulted from a slow-growing forest, then we would not expect fragile fossils such as leaves and fern fronds to be well-preserved within the laminations, yet they are. In fact, according to Dawson, some of the coals at Joggins are composed almost entirely of leaves.\n \n \n The Mysterious 40 Foot Fossil Tree: \n Dawson's account:\n \n \"Let us now endeavor to form an idea of the trees of this singular genus. Imagine a tall branchless or sparsely branching trunk, perhaps two feet in diameter, and thirty feet in height. (One has been traced to the length of forty feet in the roof of the Joggins main coal-seam ).\" 22 **\n \n This is all the information Dawson provides. He doesn't say whether it was upright, or inclined, or prostate; but, he does provide one valuable piece of information: its location.\n \n Lyell's account (of the Joggins strata) :\n \n \"Wither I went to see a forest of fossil coal-trees, the most wonderful phenomenon, perhaps that I have seen, so upright do the trees stand, or so perpendicular to the strata .... trees 25 feet high, and some have been seen of 40 feet, piercing the beds of sandstone and terminating downwards in the same beds, usually coal..\" 23 **\n \n If these two trees were one in the same, then not only was this tree upright, but it may have pierced more than just sandstone. This is because, according to Dawson: it was \"in the roof of the Joggins main coal-seam.\" Note that the 15 foot tree pictured previously is itself in the roof of the Joggins Main seam.\n \n We are only given two more clues. One is on page 165 of Acadian Geology (1868 Ed.) where Dawson says that there are \"Erect trees at one level.\" The other is Dawson's drawing above where \"erect\" trees are at two levels. Therefore, the 40 foot tree may have been at the same level as the 15 foot tree, or it may have been with the other stumps in section 6 of Dawson's drawing (section 7 below ). Therefore, if these trees were one in the same, then the drawings below provide some idea what it may have looked like.\n \n \n In either case, it would have passed through the coal seam between sections 2 and 3 above. This seam is (or was) from one to four inches thick. 24 This strongly suggests that this seam, and the strata around it, was deposited in rapid sedimentary fashion. Perhaps this is why Dawson and Lyell provided so little information about it, and why neither of them provided an illustration?\n \n In one publication, Dawson mentioned large prostrate trunks in the roof of the Joggins Main coal seam: one of which was 30 feet long; 25 however, Dawson never said whether or not the 40-foot tree was prostrate or erect. In spite of Dawson's silence on this, it seems that some have interpreted (?) this to mean that this 40 foot tree was prostrate.26 Although this is possible, it seems more reasonable to assume that Dawson's 40 foot tree and Lyell's 40 foot tree were one in the same, and that Dawson didn't say it was prostrate because he didn't want to lie about it, yet he didn't want to say that it was upright because a tree of this size that was upright and that also traversed a coal seam would not have helped the in situ hypothesis for coal formation -- something that both Dawson and Lyell were trying hard to prove. Therefore it was simply left open to question. \n \n If however, these two trees were not one in the same, then (from a geological perspective) it means that we know virtually nothing about the largest upright tree ever found at Joggins, since we would not even know were it was located. The fact that Lyell and Dawson provided us with so little information about it is either an indication of their bias against the evidence of catastrophic influences for this strata, or that they were negligent. This is further substantiated by the fact that (in similar fashion) almost nothing is known about the (upright) 25 foot tree found in the Joggins strata either. Was this because its lowermost section may have been embedded in limestone? 27 We may never know for certain as Dawson provided us with virtually no details -- except to say (in plain English) that is was \"erect.\" \n \n Note: For those who think such a long (and upright) tree as this has never been documented, I would like to introduce you to the (38 foot) tree that was discovered in similar (coal measure) strata in England. Also, in his 1966 paper on this subject, Rupke reported trees as long as 25 meters. \n \n Marine Organisms: The fact that the marine tubeworm, Spirorbis, is found in this section strongly suggests that it was deposited under marine (or brackish water) influences. With regard to the 1- 4 inch layer of coal in (section 2) of the previous drawing, and the strata overlying it we are told that:\n \n \"The roof contains Naiadites carbonarius, Cythere, Spirorbis, fish-scales, and coprolites. The Coal is hard and laminated, and has on its surface leaves of Cordaites and vascular bundles of ferns. It is remarkable for containing scattered remains of a number of species of fishes belonging to the genera Ctenoptychius, Diplodus, Palaeoniscus, and Rhizodus. The underclay has rootlets of Stigmaria, and the bed below this has large roots of the same.\" 28 **\n \n With regard to the roof strata above the lower (Main) coal seams we are told that it:\n \n \"...has afforded Sigillaria catenoides and other species, Alethopteris lonchitica, Cordaites borassifolia, Lepidodendron elegans, Trigoncarpa, Naiadites, Spirorbis, Cythere, fragments of insects. (?) The mineral Charcoal contains bast tissue, Scalariform, epidermal, and cellular tissues ... The roof is especially rich in Cordaites, sometimes with Spirorbis adherent.\" 29 **\n \n We are also told that the strata immediately above the 15 foot tree contains:\n \n \"only drift vegetable fragments having Spirorbis attached...\" 30\n \n Therefore we can be certain that it was a drift deposit. \n \n \n Missing Roots: Note the presence of roots in section 8, below the lower coal; however, there are none between the two seams. Why not? If the presence of roots in the lower underclay is proof of forest growth, then what does their absence indicate? Could it be that the upper coal never was a forest, but rather merely an organic drift deposit? If so, then perhaps the lower coal is too?\n \n Out of Order Roots: In ref. 28 above we find \"rootlets of Stigmaria\" above a bed with \"large roots of the same.\" If these deposits were in situ then we would expect to find the larger roots above the smaller rootlets. \n \n Additional Comments: The fact that the marine tubeworm Spirorbis (discussed in Part II) is found in this strata strongly suggests a marine influence. The presence of leaves and insects and drifted material in the roof suggests that the roof strata cannot be an in situ deposit but rather the result of catastrophic influences. The fact that the roots of the tree (and some of the Calamites) appear to be truncated suggests that they were deposited while floating upright. The fact that the coals are laminated is also suggestive of a sedimentary origin. The lack of distinct soils and the presence of extremely thick \"layers\" also suggests a very rapid, and changing, depositional environment. Together this evidence suggests that this whole section of strata is of catastrophic origin.\n \n Lets look at another section of strata that was also said to be in situ. The drawing below is of a 9 foot tree between shale (above) and coal (below), along with Stigmaria rootlets, Calamites, and the stem of an unknown plant.\n \n \n After Dawson, 1854, Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc. Lon., Vol. 10, p. 21; See also Acadian Geology, 1855 and 1868 Eds.\n \n 1. Underclay, with rootlets of Stigmaria, resting on gray shale, with two thin coaly seams.\n 2. Gray sandstone, with erect trees, Calamites, and other stems: 9 feet.\n 3. Coal, with erect tree on its surface: 6 inches.\n 4. Underclay, with Stigmaria rootlets.\n (a) Calamites. (c) Stigmaria roots.\n (b) Stem of plant undetermined. (d) Erect trunk, 9 feet high.\n \n Dawson believed that:\n \n \"The Stigmaria-underclay\" (in section 4) \"shows the existence of a Sigillaria forest, the soil of which collected sufficient vegetable matter to form 6 inches of coal, which probably represents a peaty bog several feet in thickness.\" 31 \n \n \n In Dawson's opinion this strata was deposited as follows:\n \n \"On this peaty soil grew the trees represented by the stump of ... charcoal mentioned above, and which were probably coniferous. This tree, being about 1 foot in diameter, must have required about fifty years for its growth ... It was then killed, perhaps by the inundation of the bog. During (its) decay ... Sigillariae, d, grew... to the diameter of two feet, when they were overwhelmed by sediment, which buried their roots to a depth of about 18 inches. At this level Calamites, a, and another Sigillaria began to grow, the former attaining a diameter of 4 inches, the latter a diameter of about a foot ... These plants were in... turn imbedded in somewhat coarser sediment, but so gradually that the trees with Stigmarian roots, c, grew at two higher levels before the accumulation of mud and sand attained a depth of 9 feet, at which depth the original large Sigillariae, that had grown immediately over the coal, were broken off, and their hollow trunks filled with sand...\" 31 **\n Note: Dawson did not include some of the trees described above in his drawing of this strata, such as the 1 foot diameter tree and the 4-inch diameter Sigillaria.\n \n Discussion:\n Dawson claimed that the trees and plants in this strata were buried in their original positions of growth (i.e. in situ). Several aspects suggest otherwise. Consider the following:\n \n Lack of Distinct Soils: The most obvious is the lack of a distinct soil in section 2. Instead there is a remarkable uniformity in the layering. \n \n Lack of Large Roots: The small singular rootlets of section 4 are of the same size and shape as the Stigmaria rootlets (c) in the upper part of section 2. If the lower underclay did at one time support \"a Sigillaria forest,\" it seems a bit odd that the only preserved evidence for this are tiny rootlets. One would think that at least some of the larger roots (from the 2 foot diameter trees) would have extended beyond the bottom of the coal, yet they appear to be absent.\n \n Note: From Logan's and Dawson's bed by bed review of the Joggins strata, there appear to be a lot fewer beds containing large roots than those with \"rootlets\", and even fewer beds that have large roots with attached rootlets. 32 \n \n Missing Roots: It is also worth noting what Dawson does not tell us. For example, he does not tell us whether these \"distinctly marked\" Stigmaria roots from the 1 foot diameter tree (not depicted) had rootlets attached. This is almost certainly because they didn't, which is why he used the term \"distinct\" to describe how they were \"marked\" (i.e. Stigmaria roots get their name from the \"distinct\" scar marks left behind by their \"missing\" rootlets). Dawson also doesn't say anything about the three upright Calamite stems \"a\" that are missing their lower portions.\n \n Why were the stems preserved but not the roots? More importantly, how were these stems preserved in upright position with no roots to hold them up? This suggests that these stems were buried while floating upright. The only other possibility is that their roots fell out of the cliff-face. However, if this were the case, Lyell and Dawson should have said so. The fact that they didn't is an indication that they were actually missing. Such instances are clearly depicted in the writings of Brown and are discussed later; however, unlike Dawson and Lyell, Brown readily admits that this was the case.\n \n Missing Trees: In the above (second) paragraph describing this strata Dawson mentions \"trees with Stigmaria roots, \"c\" that grew \"at two higher levels\" before being buried in mud and sand. With regard to these trees, all that was left was their small root-base. This seems odd, considering the fact that their bases are just as big, if not bigger than the \"a\" stem to the right. \n \n \n Lack of Erosion: Except for the 6 inch layer of coal, the strata is repetitive and displays a high degree of lateral continuity. The fact that there is no erosion between the layers is suggestive of cyclic continuous deposition.\n \n Uniformity of Direction: All except one of the stems are sloping toward the left; this suggests that a current was present during deposition.\n \n Laminated Underclay: Although it is unclear in the drawing above, the detailed view clearly shows that the underclay in section 4 is laminated or layered. This suggests it was probably not a soil, but rather simply a layered sedimentary deposit with embedded rootlets. For if this were a soil then bioturbation should have destroyed the layering. Dawson, himself, concurred with such reasoning when he stated that:\n \n \"Beds of clay containing roots of plants in situ, and destitute or nearly destitute of lamination, are designated in the Section 'Underclays.' As these are fossil soils they will be... considered in connection with the vegetable matter which accumulated upon them.\" 33 **\n Fragile Fossils: Dawson further tells us that: \"the erect trees contain reptilian remains... and remains of insects.\" 34 We are also told that one of these trees was a sandstone cast which: \"contained a large quantity of vegetable fragments...\" in the form of \"carbonized wood, leaves of Naeggerathia or Poacites?, and stems of Calamite.\" 35\n \n Different Sediments: Another obstacle to the in situ interpretation of this section is the fact that these trees were filled-in with sandstone (see in-text quote of ref. 31 on previous page). How were they filled up with sandstone when the bed immediately above them (bed #1) consists of gray shale and (above this an) underclay?\n \n Additional Comments: The fact that the underclay (with rootlets) in section 4 is laminated suggests that it may not have been a soil, but rather simply a deposit with floating upright rootlets -- or with rootlets that were \"dangling\" down from the plant mass above from which the coal was derived. The fact that fragile leaves were preserved along with upright stems, with no roots to hold them in place, suggests they were buried while floating upright. The fact that the trees were filled with different sediments than those which were immediately above (or around) their snapped off trunks is also suggestive of transport. Again the evidence suggests that the upright plants, trees, and rootlets in the above section are (probably) not in situ, but the result of drifted material that was washed in.\n \n Horizontal Shear\n Almost all of the roots and stems to the right of the tree above have been sheared off horizontally. The 9-foot tree has also suffered the same fate. This is quite common with fossil roots and trees. If this were the result of decay, then the contact along the top (of such trees) should be uneven (or jagged) rather than flat. Rupke 36 and H\u00f6rbiger37 suggested that this might be the result of the upper (now missing) portions being frozen and subsequently \"snapped\" off by an incoming tidal wave. Another possibility is that they were simply snapped off by moving debris during a flood. Such a scenario is possible when considering that these trees (and their roots) were in the fragile state of being hollow (or semi-hollow), yet partially filled with sediments. This is illustrated in the diagrams that follow. \n \n In the first set of diagrams the assumption is made that these Lycopod trees were part of large \"Floating Forests\" (as proposed by Scheven), 38 and that after being torn from their forest-mats they sank and began filling up with sediments. However, prior to becoming heavy-laden with sediments, they would be carried along by strong currents before coming to their final resting place. The second set simply shows how such hollow trees may have been snapped off, and subsequently filled with sediments that are different from those which surround them.\n ",

   "And here's more...\n \n The Fossils Themselves: \n Fossils don't form on lake bottoms today, nor are they found forming on the bottom of the sea. 15 Instead, they normally only form when a plant or animal is buried soon after it dies. 16 Therefore, the fossils themselves are evidence of a catastrophe such as a flood or volcanic eruption that took place in the past. See also Rapid Petrification of Wood, by Andrew Snelling.\n \n Clastic Dikes: According to Austin, a clastic dike is \"a cross cutting body of sedimentary material which has been intruded into a foreign rock mass.\" 17\n \n \"These dikes...(may) penetrate horizontal sedimentary strata (or) they may occur... in igneous and metamorphic rocks. The process of formation of a clastic dike is analogous to wet sand oozing up between ones toes, but on a much larger scale.\" 17\n Clastic dikes present a problem to the \"mythions of years\" mindset of evolution in that massive \"older\" sediments are found intruding up into overlying younger strata. This must have occurred while the \"older\" sediments were still in a plastic state. \n \n What took these \"older\" sediments so long to become hard?\n \n One would think that a million years would be more than enough time to turn massive sand laden sediments into sandstone, yet we have an example of sediments which are said to be 80 million years older than those above them, and yet they still had not become hard, but were in a wet and plastic state when an earth movement caused them to be forced up into the (supposedly much) \"younger\" sediments. Such things not only present serious problems for the evolutionary method of \"dating\", but also tell us that something is wrong with the millions of years mindset of evolutionary theory itself, and thus cause strongly suspicion that we are not being told the truth by the mass media, nor the \"Scientific\" community of believers in evolution. 17,18,19 \n ",

   "Turbidity Currents: \n A turbidity current is an underwater mud flow, the discovery of which caused somewhat of a revolution in geology. As a result, many sedimentary strata layers throughout the world have been reevaluated and found to be turbidites. 34,35,36,37,38,39,40\n \n For example, regarding turbidites and the impact they are having on modern Geology, Kurt Howard, 41 said the following in his paper on this topic: \n \n My physical geology professor said, \"Regarding uniformitarianism, you can take it with a grain of salt.\" After reviewing geology texts on the subject of turbidites, I am following the courageous professor's advice. To paraphrase his words, I am taking uniformitarianism with a grain of sand, for the philosophy of uniformitarianism states that sedimentary layers form over many millions of years, while ... recent research has shown that turbidites form within a few hours. {1} Emphasis Added\n \n In 1972 Burgert identified several lower basal Tapeats units as turbidites in Grand Canyon's Cheops Bay. Dr. Ariel Roth a geologist at Loma Linda University's Geoscience Institute, suggested that 30% of all sedimentary rocks in Grand Canyon are turbidites. Some geologists suggest that 50% of the world's sedimentary rocks might be turbidites. Emphasis Added\n \n Modern geologists discarded the terms flysch sediments and geosyncline because rapidly formed megathick flysch is incompatible with uniformitarianism and long ages. However, in the last few years, the number of geologists abandoning the classical uniformitarian discipline and adopting the new catastrophism is almost a shock to ... creationists. Geologists are finally beginning to grudgingly agree with ... creationists about the nature of the stratigraphic record, which is a record of major catastrophic events and not the slow year-by-year buildup suggested by uniformitarianism. Flysch deposits might be the sedimentary results of a global flood. The idea of geosynclines is unpopular because most geologists believe in plate tectonics. Emphasis Added\n \n Extensive Strata and Pancake Layering: \n As we observe sedimentary strata throughout the world we see almost everywhere flat-lying (or \"pancake\") layered strata. Many of these layers are so extensive that they cover several states. Evolutionists believe that such layers were deposited slowly over millions and millions of years, or that they are simply \"river\" deposits or river deltas. 42,43 Creationists, and a growing number of geologists see problems with such interpretations. 44,45 First because there is virtually no evidence of erosion between the layers, and second, because the sheer size and extent of the strata suggests that the layers were neither formed by rivers, or river deltas. That's because many of the \"layers\" are quite thick, and cover (literally) hundreds and even thousands of square miles, and in many instances are the size of the state of Utah, or even larger.\n \n This, coupled with the presence of marine fossils that are buried in many of the layers, tells us that they were deposited by ocean currents (i.e. from a major, major Flood), like nothing we have ever seen before.\n \n We can say for certain that it was the ocean (as opposed to a lake) because of the marine fossils that are buried in much of this strata. For example, in the Grand Canyon area itself, old Earth geologists have said that the Ocean swept over the whole area on six different occasions. Young Earth geologists say it was probably only once.",

   "6 Reasons the Global Flood Never Happened\n \n 1) A global flood, if it did occur, would have left fossils of every species in every strata as it laid down sediment. We should find all over the world, the same species in the same strata. No where on Earth do you find fossils of dinosaurs, mastodons, Precambrian shellfish and primates in the same strata. The flood was thought to have been extremely violent; churning up huge volumes of water this would have mixed the carcasses of species into one homogenous layer, advanced creatures with less advanced all whirling around in the cacophony of death together. While heavier species would have sunk faster, we should see more or less homogenous strata all over the Earth. This occurs nowhere on the planet.\n \n 2) The global flood should have left homogenous sediment layers across the world, similar to the Iridium layer that the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs left on the Earth. No such layer of sediment exists for that time period.\n \n 3) The necessary water to cover the Earth would have been astronomical. The oceans cover roughly 2/3rds of the Earth. That is sea level, to cover the highest point, Everest (29,028 feet feet above sea level), would require JUST to raise sea level, 756,821,205 Cubic miles of water.\n \n The fundemental problem is that the Oceans, seas and bays make up 96.5% of total water on the Earth and they only have 321,000,000 cubic miles. That leaves a huge amount of water that would need to come from somewhere.\n \n http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/DanielChen.shtml\n \n There's simply isn't that much water on Earth to allow such a flood.\n Some argue that the mountains weren't that tall yet. That makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift. Plates move at 1 inch a year. That's 500 feet over 6,000 years. Everest is by far taller then that. Some argue that plates moved faster. To create Everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction. While plate movements are related to the Earth's core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earth's core would have to be hundreds of times hotter. That's way more then the surface of the Sun.\n \n 4) The global flood says that the world was covered by water. The problem with that is such an infusion of water would have created brine. As the water receded and evaporated, huge amounts of salt would have remained on the land. Very few plants can grow on salted Earth, and those who can are not agricultural crops. Virtually every creature in the oceans has a low tolerance for salinity change. A slight change can result in massive dieoffs. That would mean, as the salinity rapidly changed, that many creatures, if not virtually all would have died from osmosis. That means Noah would have had to keep two of every species of oceanic creatures onboard the ship. Given the measurements, the boat cannot hold two of every whale and shark. Even worse, as most of the oxygen comes from algea and seaweed, the change in salinity and pressure would have killed off the producers of oxygen. Life simply couldn't exist after a flood of such proportions. While some modern species can survive in salinity conditions very different then their norm, most cannot survive for extended periods of time, such as 40 days. Furthermore, their prey sources often cannot survive that long as well. Even more alarming is that if the alga managed to survive, the death of billions of life on Earth would have resulted in decay which results in nutrients which would have resulted in alga explosions like no other, removing oxygen from the oceans, suffocating every living thing left.\n \n 5) Some say that the water came from underground, a mile to be percise. The problem with that is the water would be superheated. Releasing 756,821,205 cubic miles of superheated water would have boiled everything to death almost instantly. The oceans would have also boiled away, killing all marine life, fresh water lakes would have done the same. The mantle of the Earth is 100 Celsius. Therefore the steam would be roughly that hot. That's 212 degrees Fahrenheit. 756,821,205 cubic miles of 212 degree Fahrenheit water in a world that is typically no hotter then 80 degrees average would be instant death to everything.\n \n 6) Finally, flood geology requires the compaction of 4.5 billion years of comet, asteroid and meteor strikes into a single year. The problem with that is the energy from such impacts would have to be compacted as well, and we all know that the energy is converted into heat.\n \n 3 x 107 kg x 4.5 x 109 years worth of meteorite flux\n =1.35 x 1017 kg of meteoritic material fell during the flood year.\n \n The energy imparted by this amount of material is equal to:\n 1/2 M V2, where M is the mass of the extraterrestrial material, and V is the velocity at which it falls to the Earth (equal to the escape velocity, or 11200 m/s). This gives:\n 1/2 (1.35 x 1017 kg) * (11200 m/s)2\n = 8.5 x 1024 Joules.\n \n So the Earth's atmosphere would have had to accomodate 8 x 1024 J of energy from this falling meteorite matter. We can do a quick calculation to determine the amount of heating this would cause:\n \n Energy = Matmo * Cp *(T), where Matmo is the mass of the atmosphere (5 x 1018 kg), Cp is the pressure constant for air (about 716 J/kg * K for N2), and T is the temperature change of the atmosphere. Solve for T:\n T = Energy/ (Matmo * Cp)\n = 8 x 1024 J / ((5 x 1018 kg) *716 J /kg * K)\n = 2,400 K.\n \n So the temperature change of the Earth's atmosphere would be about a 2,40 K increase in a single year. That's over 3860 Fahrenheit.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=8816",

That is a good definition of natural selection. \n \n \nIf merely a brute fact, natural selection is not subject to proof or disproof, but means nothing scientific in any case, since since brute facts cannot by themselves supply an understanding of themselves or anything else they are confused for or conflated with, such as evolution itself.

If you have a better explanation, i keep asking you to explain it, but all you ever seem to be able to accomplish is yet another diatribe against \"Darwinism\".\n \n As a biologist, I have to say I am not convinced.\n \n \nIf natural selection is seen as the cause of evolution, then it must be proven to be a universal force of such regularity in its effects that a/the cause is distinct from the effect, the one is not the other, and the one cannot be confused for the other, and b/the cause is a single, unitary, universal, alocal force whose regularity and constancy enable scientific study and prediction.\n\n \n \n Well, for starters, natural selection needn't be the sole cause of evolutionary change, and biologists generally accept that there are others, such as genetic drift or developmental constraints. Secondly, natural selection is itself caused by many different kinds of mechanisms, because anything in an organism's environment is likely to have some effect on the ability of that organism to reproduce, and hence on its ability to pass its traits on to the next generation. The challenge for evolutionary biologists is to try and identify which environmental factors were particularly important in the selection process. Often, they are able to do that, and then it is reasonable to call what they are seeing natural selection.\n \n All natural selection is, is a sieve that permits some variants to produce more offspring than others. Of course, biologists aren't satisfied with just claiming that this sieving occurs, they attempt to find specific explanations for specific examples. So for example, the exotic tails of many bird species have been shown experimentally to have been selected for sexually, which is one form of natural selection. There is still an argument going on about the causes of the evolution of the giraffe's neck, with some arguing that intermale fighting is mostly responsible for it, others that feeding opportunities are.

   "I suggest that you go to a link called, TalkOrigins\", and find out for yourself just exactly what \"Darwinian theory\" does stipulate. You'll then (one can only hope) understand why \"Darwinian theory\" is totally incompatible with the view that living organisms are autopoietic, self-organizing, self-determining, dynamic, internally productive, complex systems.\n\n \n I'm a biologist. I'm sorry, but I find that statement totally baffling. Why can't self-organising systems evolve through natural selection? Give me an argument, not a bald assertion.\n \n \n \nYou get funnier and funnier. Explain how you can divorce \"self-organizing\" from \"teleology\". Do you ever stop to think about what the words you throw around actually mean and entail? Heck, do you ever stop to think at all, or do you automatically parrot darwinist jargon?\n\n \n Teleological means with intended purpose, as if say, one were to argue human noses had evolved for the purpose of holding your glasses on your face, as though some entity had predicted the need. There is no logical reason to suppose that the only way self-organising systems could evolve is because someone or something intended them to, let alone that they themselves intended to evolve that way!\n \n There are many self-organising systems in nature that it would be silly to explain teleologically. A salt crystal or snowflake... or hurricanes and tornadoes, for example. Many chemical reactions are in fact naturally cycling, such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, which is a conceptual model for known chemical cycles in biochemistry.\n \n From a biochemical perspective -- which is where I come from -- an organism can be considered as a set of self-organising, chemical systems. Now, I can readily accept that there is much more to the existence of these surviving sets of systems than just natural selection. Developmental constraints will be important; some biochemistries may be much more stable or probable than others and so have a leg up as it were; and there's always contingency and genetic drift. Biologists are aware of these possibilities and many are studying them. They mostly don't claim natural selection is the answer to every quirk of nature, though some will be more willing to credit adaptationism than others.\n \n Since they don't make such claims, why do you attack them for making them? However, since we can observe the effects of natural selection through experimentation in the lab, and often observe them in nature over a period of years, why would we doubt that natural selection is ONE engine of evolution? It doesn't have to be the only one, after all. Biologists do not put all their eggs in the natural selection basket.\n \n \nI've already told you so many times that a grade school kid would have grasped the concept by now.\n\n \n Another example of courtesy, I see!\n \n \nMeaningfully and scientifically.\n\n \n Well, if you care to actually make a scientific argument against natural selection, and for some alternative evolutionary mechanism, or refer to me to one somewhere, I'll give it due consideration. I'll need both evidence and theory. So far, you keep promising but never delivering.",

The storm lasted 40 days, as in, \"And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\" (Gen 7:12) But of course, it is hard to tell from the mixture of two flood myths in a single story how long this mythological flood lasted. The Bible also says, \"And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.\" (Gen 7:24) That would total 190 days.

That would be more than 300 days. After that, Noah waited 40 days before sending out the Raven.

And don't forget to do a few revolutions while your on it. emoticon_xgood :) \n \n You've proven what you're made of by ignoring solid scientific evidence that throws a big wrench in the works of your fairy tale religion. Evidence like this:\n \n Turbidity Currents: \n A turbidity current is an underwater mud flow, the discovery of which caused somewhat of a revolution in geology. As a result, many sedimentary strata layers throughout the world have been reevaluated and found to be turbidites. 34,35,36,37,38,39,40\n \n For example, regarding turbidites and the impact they are having on modern Geology, Kurt Howard, 41 said the following in his paper on this topic: \n \n My physical geology professor said, \"Regarding uniformitarianism, you can take it with a grain of salt.\" After reviewing geology texts on the subject of turbidites, I am following the courageous professor's advice. To paraphrase his words, I am taking uniformitarianism with a grain of sand, for the philosophy of uniformitarianism states that sedimentary layers form over many millions of years, while ... recent research has shown that turbidites form within a few hours. {1} Emphasis Added\n \n In 1972 Burgert identified several lower basal Tapeats units as turbidites in Grand Canyon's Cheops Bay. Dr. Ariel Roth a geologist at Loma Linda University's Geoscience Institute, suggested that 30% of all sedimentary rocks in Grand Canyon are turbidites. Some geologists suggest that 50% of the world's sedimentary rocks might be turbidites. Emphasis Added\n \n Modern geologists discarded the terms flysch sediments and geosyncline because rapidly formed megathick flysch is incompatible with uniformitarianism and long ages. However, in the last few years, the number of geologists abandoning the classical uniformitarian discipline and adopting the new catastrophism is almost a shock to ... creationists. Geologists are finally beginning to grudgingly agree with ... creationists about the nature of the stratigraphic record, which is a record of major catastrophic events and not the slow year-by-year buildup suggested by uniformitarianism. Flysch deposits might be the sedimentary results of a global flood. The idea of geosynclines is unpopular because most geologists believe in plate tectonics. Emphasis Added\n \n Extensive Strata and Pancake Layering: \n As we observe sedimentary strata throughout the world we see almost everywhere flat-lying (or \"pancake\") layered strata. Many of these layers are so extensive that they cover several states. Evolutionists believe that such layers were deposited slowly over millions and millions of years, or that they are simply \"river\" deposits or river deltas. 42,43 Creationists, and a growing number of geologists see problems with such interpretations. 44,45 First because there is virtually no evidence of erosion between the layers, and second, because the sheer size and extent of the strata suggests that the layers were neither formed by rivers, or river deltas. That's because many of the \"layers\" are quite thick, and cover (literally) hundreds and even thousands of square miles, and in many instances are the size of the state of Utah, or even larger.\n \n This, coupled with the presence of marine fossils that are buried in many of the layers, tells us that they were deposited by ocean currents (i.e. from a major, major Flood), like nothing we have ever seen before.\n \n We can say for certain that it was the ocean (as opposed to a lake) because of the marine fossils that are buried in much of this strata. For example, in the Grand Canyon area itself, old Earth geologists have said that the Ocean swept over the whole area on six different occasions. Young Earth geologists say it was probably only once.\n ",

If it is simply an observation of an effect, for example, 'There are now more short-beaked diddlebops than long-beaked diddlebops, and that is 'evolution by natural selection', then NS can be dismissed as meaningless. OTH, if \"NS\" is said to be a real force, a unitary force acting universally and regularly to cause predictable results, (IOW, is a true scientific mechanism), then use the scientific method to demonstrate its actuality, its reality, with accurate predictions.

   "Don't be silly. Organisms adapting is simply adaptation.\nNo, it's not. It's adaption.\n \nOrganisms adapting to novel circumstances by generating novel adaptive traits is evolution.\nDon't be silly. It is only evolution if it is genetic.\n \n\"Natural Selection\" is neither 'adaptation' nor 'evolution', although you, and who knows how many other darwinists, don't seem to grasp the very real difference in terms.\nActually, Darwinists understand quite well. Natural selection (by the way, it doesn't require capitalization since it is a scientific theory, not a god) is differential reproductive success. It isn't \"adaptation\", \"adaption\", nor \"evolution.\" Natural selection is only one mechanism of evolution that results in adaptation.\n \nJust as I said, you confused \"Natural Selection\" for evolution in your first statement. Now, admitting that \"NS\" is not a synonym for 'evolution', please tell us what it is .\nHow sad that you would attempt to discuss the topic without knowing what you are talking about.\n \nIf it is simply an observation of an effect, for example, 'There are now more short-beaked diddlebops than long-beaked diddlebops, and that is 'evolution by natural selection', then NS can be dismissed as meaningless.\nDon't be stupid. That's just a red herring based on your inability to understand.\n \nOTH, if \"NS\" is said to be a real force, a unitary force acting universally and regularly to cause predictable results, (IOW, is a true scientific mechanism), then use the scientific method to demonstrate its actuality, its reality, with accurate predictions.\nYep. That's been done.\n \nJust remember that a real scientific prediction is not 'a sure thing', but requires an outcome that is to noticeable degree, doubtful.\nSo you mean that the numerous times that the flu vaccine has missed the mark are all understandable, since that prediction is based on evolutionary concepts? But, of course, predictions are never claimed to be sure things until the prediction is fulfilled. That has happened more than once.\n \nAs for you as a biologist, I'm not impressed.\nI'm sure you're not, as someone who is quite ignorant of biology and evolutionary theory. I am impressed, since I am an evolutionary biologist.\n \nHoo boy, here come all the usual evasions, the smoke-blowing and the hand-waving. Boring!\nThanks for marking where in your post the level of required knowledge exceeds what you know. You are bored by rational responses based on knowledge that you lack.\n \n There isn't really anything more of value that you have to contribute. You have pulled yet another mturner.",

   "[QUOTE=wascallywabbit;263125No, it is NOT 'natural selection'. It's evolution. Please learn the difference.[/QUOTE]Actually, it would be nice if you learned what you were talking about. Natural selection is on mechanism of evolution. Sometimes natural selection favors stasis. Sometimes it results in a change in morphology. When there is a change in the allele frequency in a population, it is evolution. When there isn't, it is still natural selection.\n \n You don't seem to have a very good grasp on the concepts.

   "**\n Don't be silly. Organisms adapting is simply adaptation. Organisms adapting to novel circumstances by generating novel adaptive traits is evolution. \"Natural Selection\" is neither 'adaptation' nor 'evolution', although you, and who knows how many other darwinists, don't seem to grasp the very real difference in terms. \n\n \n Adaptation is what results from the operation of several natural factors, e.g. predation, climate, food availability, mate preference, etc., etc., etc. Because this process involves natural forces as opposed to man-made ones, it is called natural. Because it involves a selection of which animals succeed in having most progeny, it's called natural selection. The result, in addition to other factors which aren't natural selection, is called evolution.\n \n Why is this so hard to grasp?\n \n \n \nJust as I said, you confused \"Natural Selection\" for evolution in your first statement.\n\n \n Neither I nor any other biologist makes this confusion. The confusion is entirely in your own mind.\n \n \nIOW, you admit that \"NS\" does not fulfill the definition of a true scientific force/causal mechanism.\n\n \n Of course it fulfills the definition, because various natural selection hypotheses generate predictions, which can and have been tested in the field and lab.\n \n \nIt is NOT single, unitary, universal, alocal and dependable that predictable outcomes can derived from its regularity.\n\n \n That's the silliest definition of a scientific hypothesis I've ever seen. It's as though you are demanding a single theory explain everything. Natural selection hypotheses explain some features of evolution, including many adaptive traits. It doesn't and isn't expected to explain everything.\n \n Your argument is as logically coherent as someone who gleefully insists the germ theory of disease is disproven because not all diseases are caused by bacteria!\n \n \nOr to put it another way, \"NS\" is pseudo-scientific notionalism, a fanciful abstraction used as a label to cover everything and anything. And thus, scientifically-speaking, to mean nothing at all.\n\n \n Only in your dreams, but biologists know the lit better.\n \n \nIf its \"a sieve\" then give us its universal dimensions, and tell us what force it works with.\n\n \n See above.\n \n \nA hint--sieves generally depend upon the force of gravity, and have pre-determined numbers of gaps of a stipulated size.\n\n \n A sieve is just a selection filter that allows some elements of the system to pass while withholding others. There are many different kinds of sieving or selection. In natural selection, the final sieve is the ability of organisms to reproduce, and that includes the ability to find food and mates, and avoid predators. Scientists have demonstrated many examples of this selection process.\n \n \nIOW, they have no universal force or principle; just a cute label for anything and everything that happens to happen. Here's a tip--that ain't science!\n\n \n Yes it is, you just have the wonkiest definition of science I've seen. Scientific principles are universal only in the sense that they must operate consistently in time and space. Few scientific principles are expected to apply universally to every possible system, except the most basic physical ones. Natural selection in biology need not explain every feature of evolution. I cannot repeat this often enough.\n \n \nNo, it is NOT 'natural selection'. It's evolution. Please learn the difference.\n\n \n Biologists are well aware of the difference, and rarely conflate the two these days. What puzzles us is why you suffer the delusion that we do not.",
