   "Some people say that Home Secretary signed away huge part of civil liberties area when he pointed to 'unacceptable behavior' as good enough pretext to kick a person out of Great Britain. Those people are either blind or lack brain. In no case should we downgrade our vigilance. There are lots of Islamic maniacs glorifying violence and instigating other people to terror attacks. They are people of different strata and occupied in different spheres of life. They may be mullahs or poets or businessmen both local or foreign staying here at the moment. I wonder why are we soft on local Chechen Zakaev? That has been not once that he called for terror attacks bluntly! The other no less notorious man is the exiled Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky. They say he was part to IRA arms trade deal with Chechens as recipients in it. What if he's really no stranger to the latest terror attacks in London? Why there is no probe relating Chechens staying here? I guess they would make the first pile to be swept out from here.\n We must keep our house clean.",
