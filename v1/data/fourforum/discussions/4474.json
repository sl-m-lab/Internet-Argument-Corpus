   "Well to all appearances the situation in Ukraine will be under the seal of secrecy soon for Europeans soon as it happened for Ukraine people. The fact is that I as a European journalist can get any interesting information or interview and than pass it for publication thanks to accreditation of some reliable edition. But as I know local journalists fall into censorship which became tougher day by day. Moreover it concerns any newspapers and TV-channels even those which support supported orange revolution. Look, people fought for democracy but as a result they saw as democracy go away from Ukraine. And as I know some people think that Yuschenko is virtual president and the real power hold Timoshenko. And now she is trying to punish with her political and business opponents by abusing of power (no words in newspapers about it). I'm sure that authoritarian regime will be settled in Ukraine soon.",

   "Look, something like this is taking place in Georgia now. New president was a hope for democracy recovers in Georgia. Saakashvili came to power with roses in his hands. It was ht the hope for peace and harmony. But now even his sponsors from US shocked by his policy. About simple people I keep silent that they understood that Georgia is falling into authoritarianism!",
