Evo teaches that mutations and changes are precipitated by Environmental, Ecological and Social Pressures placed on species that force the adaptable to survive through change and the unadaptable to die off due to their inability to adapt. I DARE YOU TO LAUGH AT THAT DEFINITION OF WHAT EVO CLAIMS.If that's actually the case then the only fool here is you for lauphing at my very valid question. Are you laughing because you deny that suggestion that the onset and spread of humanity has had such a minor effect on the World that we could have any effect on the Animal Kingdom ?\n \n So your saying in a short couple of hundred years since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution we could change the Worlds weather through Global Warming, yet in the tens of thousands of years since man has walked upright and spread throughout the World encroaching on every animal habitat on Earth, it's laughable to think that the pressure we have placed on every type and species of animal we have displaced, hunted or used for our convenience has been effected at all by our presence ? Evo is real, and we are evidence that higher reason and vreativity is possible, yet it is laughable to ask why only we have evolved these abilities and not ONE other creature on earth has even come close to us in that way ? Well I fail to see the humor HI_ITS_ME, especially since it's a question every student of evo should have the courage and common sense to ask for themselves.\n \n But you can't answer it because your fraudulent science has never allowed you to ask the question, and you're to simple evidently to think this deep so it never occurred to you to ask such a question.

I'm not talking about domesticating animals or manipulating them at all through human superiority. I have already insisted that man has dominion over all creatures so I know we have control over them. My point is, if evo is true then just by our presence and the pressure our spread over the Earth has caused on all species of animals; it is a reasonable question to ask why over the last 5 million years not one other animal, even a primate, evolved enough because of the pressure caused by us to learn to talk, create technology, a written language, or just overcome their fear of fire. \n \n Any sign of intelligence would prove to me that evolution has worked for the whole planet equally and not just humanity which I insist was created above the animals by God and has dominion over the animals today just as we did the day my Heavenly Father created us in His image. \n \n \nWhere wild animals are concerned, natural selection typically selects for traits that help ensure the species' survival - not whether or not they fit our social needs since we have no direct control over their mating habits.

And you should know that I don't do well with that. Nothing you said above can be supported by the facts in reality. For example, all of the animals you mention above that are changing, and calling it evolution. Aren't dying off and being replaced by new animals as a process of evolution but are simply having offspring and breeding destructive or unneeded traits out of themselves in a very short time span. Much shorter than the millions of years and the random mutations that evo so ignorantly states is the process by which changes come to the animal kingdom.",

The elephant does not randomly grow small tusks from large ones, but the population as a whole has random range of tusk sizes, as per the differences in genetic code.

   "In each case they are adaptation based on environment or social pressures and not evolution. No random mutations are taking place...\n\n Oh, is that it? I was wondering why you thought that adaption wasn't the same thing as evolution...\n \n As I have tried to make clear to you before, mutations are not required for evolution by natural selection to occur. At least, mutations are not required at or after the time a selective pressure (in this case, humans) appears. As long as a variation exists within a population, evolution by natural selection can occur.\n \n...just rapid adaptation by an animal kingdom that is in tune with a World it has a symbiotic relationship with. As the World changes, so do the animals in order to maintain order and the chain of life.\n\n If you want to propose that animals intentionally change in response to changes in the world, go ahead. Of course, I expect you to go back to untestable claims after a short time...\n \nFoul, foul. Red herring. I'm not talking about domesticating animals or manipulating them at all through human superiority. I have already insisted that man has dominion over all creatures so I know we have control over them.\n\n Control? Hardly. I can name quite a number of organisms that we have no control over and many which we have only minimal control over. In fact, I can only think of one species that we are completely in control of.\n \nMy point is, if evo is true then just by our presence and the pressure our spread over the Earth has caused on all species of animals; it is a reasonable question to ask why over the last 5 million years not one other animal, even a primate, evolved enough because of the pressure caused by us to learn to talk, create technology, a written language, or just overcome their fear of fire.\n\n We never put such pressures on them. Our presence would not cause animals to develop advanced society, and in most cases, it wouldn't even select for it.\n \nAny sign of intelligence would prove to me that evolution has worked for the whole planet equally and not just humanity which I insist was created above the animals by God and has dominion over the animals today just as we did the day my Heavenly Father created us in His image.\n\n Intelligence is not the most important thing with regard to evolution- reproduction is. If intelligence promoted a continued line of descent better than reproduction, organisms would become pretty smart quickly.\n As for humanity being created \"above the animals\" (as if we weren't animals), we are hardly the best at propagation, so from an evolutionary standpoint, you are incorrect on that point.\n \nYou are spewing the party line now my friend. And you should know that I don't do well with that. Nothing you said above can be supported by the facts in reality. For example, all of the animals you mention above that are changing, and calling it evolution. Aren't dying off and being replaced by new animals as a process of evolution but are simply having offspring and breeding destructive or unneeded traits out of themselves in a very short time span.\n\n Sounds like evolution to me.\n \nMuch shorter than the millions of years and the random mutations that evo so ignorantly states is the process by which changes come to the animal kingdom.\n\n Maybe this was true around the birth of the Modern Synthesis, but in 2007, things are different. Punctuated equilibrium has been proposed and is now widely accepted, recombination and HGT are recognized as alternatives to mutations, and the ToE is gaining support.\n \n Welcome to the present, Mr. Van Winkle. I hope you enjoy your stay.",

   "As Obvious Child has mentioned, some effects have already been seen. \"Mosquitoes are changing the development cycles to coincide with increasingly warmer temperatures.\nThat's rapid adaptation, not evolution.\nCertainly not. This is a matter of Archy not understanding the words he is using. While the objection to mosquitoes changing developmental patterns in response to climate changes may not be evolution, it is not adaptation. It is adaption. Mosquito life cycles are keyed to temperature. That's why we in Texas like to see a warm spell in late winter that hatches the mosquitoes, followed by a hard freeze. That means a year of fewer mosquitoes.\n \n Perhaps Archy needs some definitions from dictionaries of science.\n \n \"adaptation: A change in structure, function, or behavior by which a species or individual improves its chance of survival in a specific environment. Adaptations develop as the result of natural selection operating on random genetic variations that are capable of being passed from one generation to the next. Variations that prove advantageous will tend to spread throughout the population.\"\n \n However, an adaption has several meanings. 1. Adaptation; 2. Physiological adaptions - changes that occur over the lifetime of an organism as a result of environmental conditions that enable it to respond; 3. Sensory adaption - decreased sensitivity of a sense organ because of repeated stimulation.\n \n Thus, the fact that mosquitoes develop earlier as a response to temperature is an adaption, not an adaptation. Thus, it is not evolutionary.\n \nFish species are enlarging their habitats as water temperatures rise. Many species are moving north as temperature rises.\"\nAgain, adaptation, not evolution.\nAgain, it is probably neither. It is adaption. Cold water fish live in (who'da guest?) cold water, and warm water fish live in warm water. As the water becomes warmer and the cold water fish retreat to cold water, and the warm water fish expand their range, it is (need I say it again) adaption, not adaptation. It isn't evolution.\n \nTo this list, I would also add the hedgehog and tuskless elephant examples that were presented earlier in this thread, not to mention the well known adaptation of antigens to our anti-biotics. Some of these may be learned behavioral changes more so than genetic changes, but some are genetic changes that are responses to the environment.\nIn each case they are adaptation based on environment or social pressures and not evolution.\nI don't know about hedgehogs, but in the case of tusk-less elephants, it is a fact. It is a change in the allele frequency in populations of elephants. That's evolution - that's adaptation. Of course, the development of resistance in infectious pathogens is a classic example of adaptation, i.e., evolution by natural selection.\n \nNo random mutations are taking place, just rapid adaptation by an animal kingdom that is in tune with a World it has a symbiotic relationship with. As the World changes, so do the animals in order to maintain order and the chain of life.\nBut we are not talking about random mutations. Why try to confuse the issue. We are discussing adaptation (as I defined above). Adaptation is the result of environmental action on genetic variability that exists in a population. In other words, evolution is a change in the allele frequency of a population over generations. Of course, random mutations create the genetic diversity, but you don't seem to understand that. Nevertheless, evolution (by adaptation) occurs because of that genetic diversity.\n \nWe do bread [sic] certain domestic animals to compliment our social needs - from breading [sic] dossile [sic] dogs of a wide range of shapes to breading [sic] cows to produce more milk. However, this is not natural selection but artificial selection controlled by humans for our own purposes.\n\n Foul, foul. Red herring. I'm not talking about domesticating animals or manipulating them at all through human superiority.\nActually I understand that you are not talking about artificial selection. On the other hand, you are talking about natural selection and you don't even know what it is.\n \nI have already insisted that man has dominion over all creatures so I know we have control over them.\nGreat! The please breed a cow from a rat for us. That dominion bit is such a load of ####.\n \nMy point is, if evo is true then just by our presence and the pressure our spread over the Earth has caused on all species of animals; it is a reasonable question to ask why over the last 5 million years not one other animal, even a primate, evolved enough because of the pressure caused by us to learn to talk, create technology, a written language, or just overcome their fear of fire.\nNonsense. The question is, why did we do so. Of course, the reason why none other has is because we got there first. I have no idea why you think that fear of fire is meaningful. Are you saying that if trapped in a burning building that you would just walk through the fire? After all, you BELIEVE.\n \nAny sign of intelligence would prove to me that evolution has worked for the whole planet equally and not just humanity which I insist was created above the animals by God and has dominion over the animals today just as we did the day my Heavenly Father created us in His image.\nAnd any sign of intelligence from you would prove that you are actually capable of thought. When I say, \"Let's go get the mail\", my dog runs to the door. She knows her name - she raises her head and looks when we say it. If we mention \"squirrel\", she runs to the pet door and looks at the bird feeder. And you think that none of that is a sign of intelligence? Mostly, that's a bunch of mythology based claptrap.\n \n[snip]of a very prescient statement of of evolution and human development.[/snip]\nYou are spewing the party line now my friend.\nWhat party line is that? I wasn't aware that science had a party line.\n \nAnd you should know that I don't do well with that.\nWe all know that you don't do well with reality. But try.\n \nNothing you said above can be supported by the facts in reality. For example, all of the animals you mention above that are changing, and calling it evolution. Aren't dying off and being replaced by new animals as a process of evolution but are simply having offspring and breeding destructive or unneeded traits out of themselves in a very short time span.\nDid that make sense to you when you typed it? Why do you think that dying off and being replaced is a requirement for evolution? How do you know that it isn't happening. Certainly, lots of species are dying off. Please explain the process by which they are going to be replaced.\n \n What does, \"all of the animals you mention above that are changing, and calling it evolution\" mean?\n \n Do you understand the grammatical concept of a subject and a verb, as in, \"Aren't dying off and being replaced by new animals as a process of evolution but are simply having offspring and breeding destructive or unneeded traits out of themselves in a very short time span?\"\n \n More importantly, what did those two bits of gibberish actually mean?\n \nMuch shorter than the millions of years and the random mutations that evo so ignorantly states is the process by which changes come to the animal kingdom.\nDo you know what a verb is? It seems not, since you don't seem compelled to include one in many of your sentences. The result is gibberish",

   "[COLOR=&quot;Sienna&quot;]That's rapid adaptation, not evolution.\n \n Again, adaptation, not evolution.\n\n I agree that those two example - the mosquitoes and the fish - might not be evolution. That is what I was referring to as examples of \"learned behavioral changes more so than genetic changes\".\n \nIn each case they are adaptation based on environment or social pressures and not evolution. No random mutations are taking place, just rapid adaptation by an animal kingdom that is in tune with a World it has a symbiotic relationship with. As the World changes, so do the animals in order to maintain order and the chain of life.\n\n However, these changes (tuskless elephants) ARE due to changes in the genetic distribution of the elephant population, which I understand is a definition of Evolution. Granted, if there were never any new genetic mutations, then the effects of the environment would only have certain animal populations change back and forth within a certain range determined by the existing genetic variations in their populations. New genetic mutations are needed to move farther afield - ex. to eventually change a fish into an elephant after many hundreds of millions of years.\n \nFoul, foul. Red herring. I'm not talking about domesticating animals or manipulating them at all through human superiority.\n\n I realize that artificial selection is not what you were referring to. The reason I brought that example up is because it was the only one I could think of where the genetic distribution of certain animal population are adapted to our needs.\n \n I have already insisted that man has dominion over all creatures so I know we have control over them. \n\n I know that this is your religious belief. How would you explain how that happens in the physical world? Specifically, in what way are you claiming that humans control the reproductive habits of wild animals? (I mention reproductive habits since those are the most significant where Evolution is concerned).\n \nMy point is, if evo is true then just by our presence and the pressure our spread over the Earth has caused on all species of animals; it is a reasonable question to ask why over the last 5 million years not one other animal, even a primate, evolved enough because of the pressure caused by us to learn to talk, create technology, a written language, or just overcome their fear of fire. \n\n Taking on that list, a written language was not due to biological evolution but due to slow social evolution. It is interesting to note that I have seen experiments in which apes are taught to spell basic words. They may be FAR less advanced than we are but some of the basic mental abilities are there.\n \n As for talking, that means communication. Nearly all animals have some form of communication but it is far less advanced than our own - which can carry much more detailed information as well as abstract concepts and logic. It is again interesting to note that there have been documentaries about a parrot called Alex which learned 300 english words and their meanings, which he uses in sentences. So, it is NOT mimicry, but intelligent use of language. When quized, he can even tell you, for example, how many green triangular blocks there are in a small pile of multicolored, multishaped blocks (and this is not a fake setup or fraud). Also, documentaries about ape intelligence shows that their call signs are far more detailed than we originally thought - where their excited calls about particular foods tell other apes some information about what types of foods they are excited about.\n \n As for technology, apes do use tools - for example, long sticks to dig out ants from their nests in order to eat them. Sea otters use rocks to crack open shells. All of this says that intelligence is not an all or nothing matter in evolution. Our intelligence is simply well developed compared to the other creatures of this world. Perhaps others can address this better, but it must have been a more unique set of social / environmental pressures that had us develop intelligence before other creatures.\n \nYou are spewing the party line now my friend. And you should know that I don't do well with that. Nothing you said above can be supported by the facts in reality. For example, all of the animals you mention above that are changing, and calling it evolution. Aren't dying off and being replaced by new animals as a process of evolution but are simply having offspring and breeding destructive or unneeded traits out of themselves in a very short time span. Much shorter than the millions of years and the random mutations that evo so ignorantly states is the process by which changes come to the animal kingdom.\n\n I am not sure what you are getting at here or what, specifically, in my claim you contested. As I mentioned before, the changes in, say, the tuskless Elephant is short term but that is a change based on existing variations in the population. You cannot in a short period of time have elephants gaining human level intelligence or language since there exists not a single elephant now that has anywhere near those capabilities. Only if such an elephant existed and could breed at a much greater rate than the others could such a fast change arise. The only way to get a super-intelligent elephant is if one arose through some highly improbable mutation. Since such a mutation is so improbable, it would take millions of years, and likely many steps of mutations, for such a change to arise. All I am saying is that, yes, the smaller changes (tuskless elephants) can happen faster since tuskless elephants already existed where the environment allowed them to breed more profusely and thus change the population. To make any change, you need an existing member of the species that has that change - something which requires an improbable random mutation if you are talking about much larger changes.",

Any examples of such events would legitimate examples of evolution. What I am saying is that the examples, as stated, are not evolution. In the fish example, the fish did not change in response to the environmental changes, they migrated - they shifted their range to remain in the same environment. Mosquitoes hatch according to the ambient temperature. If spring is late, they hatch late. If early, there are early mosquitoes.\n \nBut couldn't climate change, specifically warmer temperatures start to favor individuals that have genes that have faster development to take advantage of warmer climates?\nMost certainly.

The fish moved rather than changed and the mosquitoes hatched earlier.\n \nI'm not saying that our effects on climate change are causing direct evolution, just changing some environmental pressures.\nRight. I understand that. Certainly you are correct that climate change does cause selective pressure on organisms. But in the examples, the organisms moved to escape the pressure rather than change.\n \n The tusk-less elephants, however, is an example of natural selection. Tusk-less elephants tend to live longer and produce more offspring. It doesn't matter that the cause is ivory poaching, it is still natural selection since these changes in allele frequency in elephant populations were not intended.
