   "-FAMOUS POLITICIANS\n \n BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n \n \"Only the police should have handguns.\"\n \n \"When we got organized as a country, we wrote a fairly radical Constitution with a radical Bill of Rights, giving a radical amount of individual freedom to Americans. There's too much personal freedom. When personal freedom's being abused, you have to move to limit it.\" 275\n \n Fact: Wang Jun (son of the late Chinese President Wang Zhen) who is chairman of the China International Trade and Investment Company and President of Polytechnologies Corp., attended a White House coffee with Clinton in February 1996 and was granted a meeting with Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown the next day.\n \n He also was connected to more than $600,000 in illegal campaign contributions to the Democrats, the report said. Polytechnologies is an arms-trading company indicted for\n trying to smuggle 2,000 Chinese AK-47 assault rifles into the United States and it is the largest of the corporate structures owned by the People's Liberation Army. 276\n \n V.I. LENIN\n \n \"One man with a gun can control 100 without one. ... Make mass searches and hold executions for found arms.\"\n \n DIANNE FEINSTEIN, U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA\n \n \"Banning guns addresses a fundamental right of all Americans to feel safe.\" 277\n \n \"If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them: \"Mr. and Mrs. America, turn 'em all in,\" I would have\n done it.\" 278\n \n \"The national guard fulfills the militia mentioned in the Second amendment. Citizens no longer need to protect the states or themselves.\"\n \n JOSEPH STALIN\n \n \"If the opposition disarms, well and good. If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves\"\n \n FRANK LAUTENBERG, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY\n \n \"We have other legislation that all of you are aware that I have been so active on, with my colleagues here, and that is to shut down the gun shows.\" 279\n \n ADOLF HITLER\n \n \"The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing.\" 280\n \n HOWARD METZENBAUM, FORMER U.S. SENATOR\n \n \"No, we're not looking at how to control criminals ... we're talking about banning the AK-47 and semi-automatic guns.\"\n \n CHARLES PASHAYAN, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM CALIFORNIA\n \n \"All of this has to be understood as part of a process leading ultimately to a treaty that will give an international body power over our domestic laws.\" 281\n \n PETE STARK, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM CALIFORNIA\n \n \"If a bill to ban handguns came to the house floor, I would vote for it.\" 282\n \n WILLIAM CLAY, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM MISSOURI\n \n \" ...we need much stricter gun control, and eventually should bar the ownership of handguns\"\n \n JOSEPH BIDEN, U.S. SENATOR FROM DELAWARE\n \n \"Banning guns is an idea whose time has come.\"\n \n JOHN CHAFEE, FORMER U.S. SENATOR FROM RHODE ISLAND\n \n \"I shortly will introduce legislation banning the sale, manufacture or possession of handguns (with exceptions for law enforcement and licensed target clubs). . . . It is time\n to act. We cannot go on like this. Ban them!\" 283\n \n JAN SCHAKOWSKY, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM ILLINOIS\n \n \"I believe.....this is my final word......I believe that I'm supporting the Constitution of the United States which does not give the right for any individual to own a handgun....\" 284\n \n MAJOR OWENS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW YORK\n \n \"We have to start with a ban on the manufacturing and import of handguns. From there we register the guns which are currently owned, and follow that with additional bans and acquisitions of handguns and rifles with no sporting purpose.\"\n \n BOBBY RUSH, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM ILLINOIS\n \n \"My staff and I right now are working on a comprehensive gun-control bill. We don't have all the details, but for instance, regulating the sale and purchase of bullets.\n Ultimately, I would like to see the manufacture and possession of handguns banned except for military and police use. But that's the endgame. And in the meantime, there\n are some specific things that we can do with legislation.\" 285\n \n -ACTS OF VIOLENCE COMMITTED BY MEMBERS OF GUN CONTROL ORGANIZATIONS\n \n \u0095Barbara Graham, speaker at the \"Million Mom March\" in 2000, was convicted of shooting and paralyzing for life a man she mistook as one who had killed her son. 286\n \n \u0095In Fort Collins, a woman who opposes the right of self-defense struck a member of the Tyranny Response Team with a clipboard. 287\n \n \u0095At a rally in Boulder early in 2000, Robert Howell, vice president of the anti-gun Boulder Bell Campaign, attacked Shariar Ghalam, bloodying his nose. (Ghalam was carrying a concealed handgun but never drew it, not believing his life was in danger.)\n \n \u0095In the summer of 2000, supporters of the anti-gun Million Mom March stole supplies from the Second Amendment Sisters and vandalized SAS property. 288\n \n \u0095Ari Armstrong, a pro-civil rights activist in Colorado, received threatening telephone calls allegedly from members of S.A.F.E (an anti-gun group) after Ari appeared on\n television promoting firearm freedoms. 289\n \n \u0095Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, who spearheaded suits against the gun industry, was arrested after allegedly striking his wife in the head with a terra-cotta canister. 290\n \n -ANTI-FREEDOM POLITICAL ACTIVISTS\n \n THE COALITION TO STOP GUN VIOLENCE\n \n \"It is our aim to ban the manufacture and sale of handguns to private individuals.\" 291\n \n \"We will never fully solve our nation's horrific problem of gun violence unless we ban the manufacture and sale of handguns and semiautomatic assault weapons.\" 292\n \n NELSON T. \"PETE\" SHIELDS, CHAIRMAN EMERITUS, HANDGUN CONTROL, INC. 293\n \n \" .... the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition except for the military, policemen, licensed security guards, licensed\n sporting clubs, and licensed gun collectors -- totally illegal.\" 294\n \n \"Yes, I'm for an outright ban (on handguns).\" 295\n \n \"We'll take one step at a time, and the first is necessarily - given the political realities - very modest. We'll have to start working again to strengthen the law, and then again to strengthen the next law and again and again. Our ultimate goal, total control of handguns, is going to take time. The first problem is to slow down production and sales.\n Next is to get registration. The final problem is to make possession of all handguns and ammunition (with a few exceptions) totally illegal.\" 296\n \n SARAH BRADY, CHAIRPERSON FOR HANDGUN CONTROL, INC. (NOW THE BRADY CAMPAIGN)\n \n \"...I don't believe gun owners have rights.\" 297\n \n \"We would like to see, in the future, what we will probably call needs-based licensing of all weapons. ...Where it would make it much more difficult for anybody to be able to\n purchase handguns....\" 298\n \n \"To me, the only reason for guns in civilian hands is for sporting purposes.\" 299\n \n ELLIOT CORBETT, SECRETARY, NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR A RESPONSIBLE FIREARMS POLICY\n \n \"Handguns should be outlawed.\"\n \n BERNARD PARKS, CHIEF OF POLICE, L.A. CALIFORNIA\n \n ``We would get rid of assault weapons. There would not be an assault weapon in the United States, whether it's for a show or someone having it in a collection.\" 300\n \n JOSH SUGARMANN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE VIOLENCE POLICY CENTER\n \n \" . . . immediately call on Congress to pass far-reaching industry regulation like the Firearms Safety and Consumer Protection Act . . . [which] would give the Treasury\n Department health and safety authority over the gun industry, and any rational regulator with that authority would ban handguns.\" 301\n \n PATRICK V. MURPHY, FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER\n \n \"We are at the point in time and terror where nothing short of a strong uniform policy of domestic disarmament will alleviate the danger which is crystal clear and perilously\n present. Let us take the guns away from the people.\" 302\n \n AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION (ACLU)\n \n \"We urge passage of federal legislation . . . to prohibit . . . the private ownership and possession of handguns.\" 303\n \n ROSIE O'DONNELL, TV TALK SHOW HOSTESS\n \"I think there should be a law -- and I know this is extreme -- that no one can have a gun in the U.S. If you have a gun, you go to jail. Only the police should have guns.\" 304\n \n \"I don't care if you want to hunt, I don't care if you think it's your right. I say, sorry, you are not allowed to own a gun, and if you do own a gun I think you should go to prison.\" 305\n \n VIOLENCE POLICY CENTER\n \n \"[gun] Licensing systems are very expensive to administer . . . licensing and registration in America would have little effect on the vast majority of gun violence.\"\n \n BROOKS BROWN, SAFE COLORADO\n \n \"It was worth lying to him, or deceiving him . . .\" 306\n \n -THE MEDIA\n \n MICHAEL GARDNER, PRESIDENT OF NBC NEWS\n \n \"There is no reason for anyone in this country . . . to buy, to own, to have, to use a handgun ...The only way to control handgun use in this country is to prohibit the\n guns.\" 307\n \n \"In fact, only police, soldiers -- and, maybe, licensed target ranges -- should have handguns. No one else needs one.\" 308\n \n CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST\n \n \"The Brady Bill's only effect will be to desensitize the public to regulation of weapons in preparation for their ultimate confiscation.\" 309\n \n \"Passing a law like the assault weapons ban is a symbolic, purely symbolic move. ... Its only real justification is not to reduce crime but to desensitize the public to the regulation of weapons in preparation for their ultimate confiscation.\" 310\n \n EDITORIAL, LOS ANGELES TIMES\n \n \"Why should America adopt a policy of near-zero tolerance for private gun ownership? Because it's the only alternative to the present insanity. Without both strict limits on\n access to new weapons and aggressive efforts to reduce the supply of existing weapons, no one can be safe.\" 311\n \n \"...The Times supports a near-total ban on the manufacture and private ownership of handguns and assault weapons, leaving those guns almost exclusively in the hands of law enforcement officials.\" 312\n \n JACK E. WHITE, TIME MAGAZINE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT\n \n \"Why not just ban the ownership of handguns when nobody needs one? Why not just ban semi-automatic rifles? Nobody needs one.\" 313\n \n GARY WILLS, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST\n \n \"Every civilized society must disarm its citizens against each other.\" 314\n \n -THE MEDIA IN GENERAL\n \n A two-year study by the Media Research Center concluded that television reporters are overwhelmingly opposed to Second Amendment rights. For broadcasts from major\n networks from July 1, 1995 to June 30, 1997, covering 244 gun policy stories:\n \n \u0095The ratio of anti-gun to pro-gun bias was 16:1.\n \u0095Anti-gun spokespeople (Sarah Brady, etc) were given three times the number\n of sound bites than pro-gun spokespeople (NRA, etc).\n \n -YOUR GOVERNMENT\n \n The following exchange is from the appeal of the case of U.S. vs. Emerson in the Fifth Circuit Court. Meteja was the attorney for the U.S. Government. \n \n Judge Garwood: [to Federal lawyer]: \"You are saying that the Second Amendment is consistent with a position that you can take guns away from the public? You can restrict ownership of rifles, pistols and shotguns from all people? Is that the position of the United States?\"\n \n Meteja: [government lawyer]: \"Yes\"\n \n Garwood: \"Is it the position of the United States that persons who are not in the National Guard are afforded no protections under the Second Amendment?\"\n \n Meteja: Exactly.\n \n Meteja then said that even membership in the National Guard isn't enough to protect the private ownership of a firearm. It wouldn't protect the guns owned at the home of\n someone in the National Guard.\n \n Garwood: Membership in the National Guard isn't enough? What else is needed?\n \n Meteja: The weapon in question must be used in the National Guard.\n \n GEORGE NAPPER, ATLANTA PUBLIC-SAFETY COMMISSIONER\n \n \"If I had my druthers, the only people who would have guns would be those who enforce the law.\" 315\n \n JANET RENO, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL\n \n \"The most effective means of fighting crime in the United States is to outlaw the possession of any type of firearm by the civilian populace.\" 316\n \n *****************************\n \n 275 MTV's \"Enough is Enough\", March 22, 1994\n 276 CNN May 24, 1999\n 277 Associated Press, November 18, 1993\n 278 CBS-TV's \"60 Minutes,\" February 5, 1995\n 279 Press conference on March 1, 2000\n 280 Hitler's Secret Conversations, trans.
