I don't get, first democrats approve going in, then they stab Bush in the back and say \"OIL!!!\" well I guess that's a democrat for ya... Oil has nothing to do with it because it would be insanely cheaper to simply buy the oil. Oil is sold internationally and the cost of a war doesn't even come close to the cost of oil. \n \n Now to compare Bush to HITLER was just mean, and shows your ignorance. There's no similarity. One Hitler was in the business of domination, where as Bush is in the business of liberation and protection against foreign attack, and everyone should be grateful. Remember people, Bush isn't out to get the Islamic communities like Hitler was out to get the Jews, Bush is out to get terrorists and people like Saddam.

The killing of inocent people in the name of God is a good religious value? \n Nonsense as Marx said religion is the opiate of the masses.\n \n \n \"The Bible is one of the greatest blessings bestowed by God on the children of men.- It has God for its author; salvation for its end, and truth without any mixture for its matter.- It is all pure.\" - John Locke\n \n All those things are bad... I never said that religion doesn't have its down falls. But religion has done this world much more good then evil. People developed a strong sence of morals; what are morals with out religion, why have laws with out religion? hundrends of years ago laws, some of the very laws we hold dear today, were created because people valued something and those values where created in the name of God. With out God theres no point to anything. Theres no reason for anything. Everyone should be able to do what ever they wish, steel, rape, murder, who cares. we're just going to die and thats the end of it, so why not live my life fufilling all the dirty, sinful desires I have? I would have it no other way, i welcome these Judeo-Christian values that we have embraced, and I wish them to be taught to future generations.\n \n \nNot one of the top republicans in congress or the administration, other then Bush, has served in the military.\n\n \n Republican Congress members with military backgrounds\n Gary Miller, Darrell Issa (Captain), Duncan Hunter, C. L. (Butch) Otter, Conrad R. Burns, Richard (Doc) Hastings, John Kline, Jim Ramstad, Jim Gibbons, Ted Stevens, Don Young, John McCain, Jim Kolbe, Robert F. Bennett, Craig Thomas, Wayne Allard, Heather A. Wilson, Louie Gohmert, Sam Johnson, Ralph M. Hall, Mike Conaway, Ron Paul, James M. Inhofe, Pat Roberts, Chuck Hagel, Thomas W.

Peterson, Donald Sherwood, Joseph R. Pitts, Peter T. King, Sherwood L. Boehlert, Thomas M. Reynolds, Robert R. Simmons, Christopher Shays, Jack Reed, Rodney P. Frelinghuysen \n \n Members of the Bush Administration With Military Background\n Alberto Gonzales, Donald Rumsfeld (the most obvious one!!!), Norman Mineta, Jim Nicholson, And as said before George W. Bush himself. \n \n Now thats not as impressive as the amount of Congress men that have military backgrouds but lets not forget although theres 21 members in Bush's Administration, members of departments like; the Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, and Department of Labor don't need military backgrounds.\n \n Well i think we can put that little myth to bed. emoticon_xgood",

The sequence of pictures of poor little children hurt by the war can be easily countered with pictures of the faces of the dead Kurdish children that were gassed by their \"leader\", or pictures of the nearly three thousand people who died on 9-11 as a result of the terrorism we are trying to subdue today.

I don't get, first democrats approve going in, then they stab Bush in the back and say \"OIL!!!\" well I guess that's a democrat for ya... Oil has nothing to do with it because it would be insanely cheaper to simply buy the oil.

Simple, standard geostrategic concerns:\n In November 2000 Iraq opened an oil market denominated in Euros and not US$, much as the Iranians are planning at the moment. While not a direct threat to the dollar in itself, if the market was successful (which it undoubtedly would be) and other countries follow suit, it would lead to central banks around the world dumping their dollar reserves in favour of the Euro and other currencies, forcing the US to massively increase interest rates or face hyperinflation.9/11 provided the US administration with an excuse to attack Iraq after Afganhistan (where, by the way, a major oil pipeline is being/has been built now that we have a significant military presence there). Immediately following the invasion, the Iraq oil market re-opened priced in dollars. The State Deparament even had plans to sell off Iraq's oil to US and British companies. The invasion is part of a wide-ranging plan to dominate the central Asian region which contains enormous energy resources; following the invasion of Afghanistan new military bases were acquired by the US in the central asian region, not long before the withdrawal in April 2003 of US forces from their traditional home, Saudi Arabia.\n The occupation of Iraq IS unequivocally about oil, but not in the simplistic sense that some opponents of the war often unfortunately believe. \n \n The coming decade will see oil prices continue to rise as China, India and much of the third world continue to industrialise; demand will increase far faster than supply can keep up with. The issue of remaining oil reserves is irrelevant. The Bush administration has taken steps to attempt to be on top of the game when the energy crisis becomes a serious issue. \n \n Iran is now the only country in the region that is not subservient in one way or another to Western interests, and we are fighting hard to maintain a grip on Iraq that seems to be slipping, and we are making threatening noises in Iran's direction. \n \n Read this article on US interests in Iraq:Oil In Iraq: The Heart of the Crisis\n \n and this one on the 2002 National Security Strategy which sets out the new US doctine of \"Full Spectrum Dominance\":Dominance and its Dilemmas",

One of my goals with the making of this video was to make people think and share their views. Which has seemed to work. It was more aimed at the ignorant stupid teenagers that I have to deal with on a daily basis. I am glad that this post turned out the way it did though.\n \n Evan pointed out the quote my John Locke. I think thats a combination of historiography and personal opinion just like Karl Marx's ideas. I think its a weak statement because you could argue that with any theory. \n \n Some of this stuff is way over my head, seeing how im a highschool sophmore. Not to mention in a school full of ignorant fools.\n \n From what I understand, it seems that the US doesn't do anything relating to military action unless it will affect us. We didn't join WWII untill we were attacked right? Same thing with Korea we helped cause of the fear of a Communist take over. And as-well with sadam,it seemed like when he was killing his own people and leaving us alone. We didn't show any aggression to take action. \n \n The little gay marriage tiff going on, the whole tittle thing. If you make them both Civil union, wont the married heterosexual population have a problem with their tittle being brought down to a \"lower level\"?\n Even with the equality, the differences and disputes will still exist. \n \n ugh.. now im just talking out my :xcensored \n \n Iv'e drawn blank for reply's to all of this.
