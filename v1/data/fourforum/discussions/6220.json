It's a condition called anencephaly, which is always fatal.\n \n When the government refused to pay for an abortion, Doe, then 19 and working at the Navy Exchange, turned to the Northwest Women's Law Center, a non-profit group working to advance legal rights for women.\n \n U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly of Seattle ruled in favor of Doe and ordered the government to cover the cost of the abortion. But the Justice Department, which told Zilly that the refusal to cover the abortion \"furthers the government's interest in protecting human life in general and promoting respect for life,\" appealed to the 9th Circuit.\n \n Lisa Stone, executive director of the women's law center, slammed Thursday's appeals court ruling, saying the standard of review it used in deciding the case \"is not a rubber stamp for whatever Congress does.\"\n \n The rational basis behind the prohibition on termination of pregnancy is the preservation of potential human life,\" Stone said. \"With an anencephalic fetus, there is no life. Therefore, it's irrational, and I would say cruel, to apply the restriction in a case like Jane Doe's. This is about the government making this principle that is irrational and tragic.\"\n \n The principle is part of a larger conservative political philosophy codified by Congress almost 30 years ago in the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal money for abortions except if a pregnancy endangers the woman, or in the case of a rape or incest that is promptly reported to authorities.\n \n Stone called the restriction on military abortions even more \"draconian\" because it does not contain an exemption for rape or incest.\n \n The Justice Department told The Associated Press Thursday that it would not comment on the case.\n \n Stone said she had not been able to reach Doe and that no decision had been reached on whether to appeal the 9th Circuit decision.",

You don't need a doctor for it, you don't need medicine (once again in most cases). Prozac(and othes) are way over prescribed and are not needed. If my mom or dad dies I feel sad, it doesn't mean I should be able to kill someone and it certainly doesn't give present a life threatening ordeal. This reminds me of a great song called 'Seek Up' by the way. It goes \"you seek up and emotion and your happy is overflowing; you seek up an emotion sometimes your well is dry; you seek up a big monster for a one to fight your wars for, but when he fines his way to you the Devil's not going ha ha\"\n The song goes on to talk about how we you stop our selfish ways because we all won't be here very long. Anyway, the point about the song is that we all do tend to 'seek up' emotions and while they do exist we just need to understand that they are natural just like breathing.
