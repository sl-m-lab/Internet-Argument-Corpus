Tracking down marijuana growers by reviewing electricity bills, they say, is a common practice.\n \n \"I understand they feel something isn't appropriate here, but it is very much consistent with how search warrants are prepared,\" said police Lt. Bill Rowland.\n \n When authorities noticed how high the bill for the Dagy home was, they sent a police dog to the neighborhood, and it reacted as though it had smelled drugs.\n \n They also noticed the family had put its trash out that morning, something police say drug growers often do to hide the evidence. In the Dagys' case, however, it was trash day.\n \n When officers returned on March 19 with a search warrant, Dagy was volunteering at her son's second-grade class. She was heading back to her car when police arrived at the school, and she returned home and let them into the house.\n \n They found nothing illegal, and she says she feels fortunate she wasn't in her son's classroom when they arrived.\n \n \"I would have been so embarrassed,\" she said, \"and my son would have died: `They're taking your mommy away!'\"\n\n \n You know, I have a few problems with this. THe biggest one is, what were the police doing looking at electric bills? When my wife and I moved, she had the power at the new place turned on in her name. When I called to discus the bill, I was told that they could not discuss it with me because I was not listed as an authorised contact on the account. They claimed this was the law. Why should the police have access to my electric bill without a court order or my permission?\n \n My secod question is, what kidn of sorry judges do we have that issue warrants based on this kind of stuff? \n \n I was once the target of a drug related raid when w thermal scan from a helicopter picked up the heat from a large transformer in my shop. Thy thought it was grow lights, which means, of course, that I am growing marajuana. I dircted them down the road where there is a guy who actually DOES have a bunch of grow lights set up in his barn (he grows orchids).\n \n We are actually supposed to trust these supposed law enforcement types? We are supposed to believe that America is not leaning towards a police state when they are perusing our electic bills and performing arial recon on us?",

   "Sarcasm does not show up well in forums. I am glad you were kidding, I figured it either had to be a joke, or you were an idiot. You don;t seem like an idiot, but it never hurts to check.\n \n It would seem to me that this should be illegal, but it appears after doing a little research that this has been going on for a while. I would think that there would be privacy issues regarding large scale examination of electric bills. OF course, this reminds me of another case I saw a while back in the news where the FBI apparently became suspicious of somebody because of certain purchases they had made with their credit cards. If they were not already suspicious of the person, why did they have access to their credit card purchases? I have heard form a couple of different sources that information like this (spending habits and credit card purchases) is being pooled and examined by law enforcement. I had always classified it as paranoid rants. I am starting to wonder if maybe there isn't something to it.....",

They aren't specifically looking for my bill or your bill for that matter. It seems like they would check those bills that are suspiciously high or not normal for that section of town. I'd imagine they would check it against previous months or years and see if some sort of trend that matches up with charges associated with growing lamps. Why they just got the warrant without some sort of surveillance is beyond me, however. Around here, they watch the house for a number of weeks, process the trash for drug residue and a physical address from the trash (to link the drug residue with the address), and then get a warrant for a drug raid.\n \n If the police have a system to weed out %99.9 of normal behavior for spending, as an example, and my spending habits line up for them to warrant further investigation, I have no problems opening up to them for that reason ONLY.",

Great to get those \"drug lords\" right? The cops can take your property, and not charge you with a crime, if you did not do it, that's ok, you can sue the cops to get compensation for it. My brother-in-laws girlfriend was driving in Fl, got pulled over for speeding. The cop found 2 or 3 joints in her truck; she got to walk home. I know no story that sounds like that looks true. \n In Chicago they can take your cat if you are transporting fireworks with out a HAZMAT license. In cook co. IL. They can take your car if the radio is too loud. (We all cheer if it was that base cannons). emoticon_xdonno",
