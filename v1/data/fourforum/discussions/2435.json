   "Why?\n \n If the Democrats are serious about winning the white house why out of the 9 Democratic potentials did they pick Kerry?\n \n I said from the beginning that a good choice for the Democrats would be lieberman. When discussing this with liberals, I recieved that answer that he was too moderate. And so I accepted this as an answer.\n \n But now as the general election looms isn't the goal of both contenders to appear as moderate as possible in order to win independent votes? So why not go with Lieberman in the first place?\n \n Kerry is stiff and lacks emotion, and he also considerably liberal. \n \n Would not Edwards (who during the primaries won many more votes independent votes than Kerry) or Lieberman have been a better pick for Dem. nominee?",

   "I think they voted their hearts, not their heads (a common liberal failing). There were democrat canidates who could have taken swing voters, there were even democratic canidates who could have taken disenfranchised republican voters. Kerry is not one of them. Now, those republicans who feel bush failed them will be voting for him again (or maybe third party) and swing voters who vote their head can be expected to avoid kerry like the plague.\n \n I suppose he must be counting on the folks who would vote for a reterded monkey over bush. I hope there are not really that many blind people in this country. Personally, I would rather have clinton, buush I, or even reagn (alzheimers and all) than wither of our current choices.",

Steel and other metals are exorbitantly high due to demand from China.

Interest rates have been held artificially low for years to stimulate housing and durable goods purchases. Last, but not least, we've been sold an expensive war that is sucking dollars out of this country like a vacuum and playing with the Dow every time something \"bad\" happens (please refer to evening news any night of the week for a current example of \"bad\").

Thats good simple minds would, but the money market is falling the interest rates are going to go up. And as far as those 600.000 so called jobs those are Mc Donald jobs that were changed to manufacturing jobs so that is a lie too also the other jobs are high quietly living jobs. So keep thinking Bush and all of his BS because it is going to come around and bite you in the end. emoticon_xhoho",

   "Our government spends many, many millions of dollars polishing those numbers to sooth the public. All the economists quoted are either government employees or brokerage house sources. If you want to look at the economy with an objective eye, go into the GDP numbers and look at the contributions from consumer and government spending based on debt. Tell me how long that can be sustained. New jobs? Nice warm feeling about government new job numbers is that unlike those filing for unemployment benefits, new job numbers don't say what kind of jobs, nor do they have a breakdown of how many are government jobs (fastest growing sector of the economy and it never decreases) or related to the burgeoning military support industry (tax dollars) created by Iraq. Interest rates? The only normal reason interest rates rise is because demand creates competition for the dollars, a market force. Raising them because inflation is rearing its head due to a weak dollar and demand by foreign investors for more interest (we're at less than half the rest of the developed world) is considered reason enough. Real rising interest rates would be created by expansion demand of the industrial sector, which would also create accompanying jobs. Take a look at what a 1% fed interest increase will do in reducing the number of people who can qualify for a new home, our only thriving industry. Deficit spending, etc.? \n \n At this point, Homer Simpson is looking better and better as a candidate",
