   "I have a question for the gays and lesbians on this forum. I need to give a little back story here first though. One of my best friends of 15 years is gay but in the closet. He is 20. I, and my family have known he is gay for some time now. I am almost certain that he knows we know he is gay. The other day he even brought a guy over to our house as his \"friend.\" I have been thinking of writing him a letter letting him know that we know and that he can be out with us. Do you think this is a good idea? If you were him in this situation, would you want a friend to just say \"Look, I know,\" or would that be intimidating? I know every person is different, I just wanted to get a general sense of what people thought.",

   "Never tell some you know they are gay by letter especially if you consider them family; it sounds so cold.\n \n \n Try this, if this doesn't sound hoaky, hug him tell \"we love you, we want you to be happy, and no matter what happens we will allways love you. If you stress this he may just tell you on his own. He may have been trying to tell you by bringing his boyfriend to meet people he considers his family. The fear of rejection, by people you love, can be very powerful. You could also send him a subtle hints that you know and it is allright and you love him. whenever you talk to him try adding his boyfriend into the conversation, such as \"what does \"john think of this\" or \"what are you and John doing lately\" as you would if he a girlfriend.Try inviting him and his boyfriend to dinner, as you would if he had a girlfriend. Send him an invitation in the mail addressed John & John Smith-Doe, using thier first names and put a \"-\" between their last names. Above all if you are truelly ok with this let him feel safe and stress that you love him and nothing will ever make you stop loving him.\n \n Hope this helps.",

   "I wouldn't suggest that you \"out\" him, When he is ready he will tell you, but coming out is difficult to do. For some people it takes years to get passed the fear of rejection for others it is the fear that if they say it is true, it makes it more solid. I know for me, I didn't come out till I was 22 years old. I wasn't worried about rejection at all, I was worried that if I finally said it, it would mean it was really true, and I didn't want to be gay. \n \n Your friend could be having simialr feelings. I had a \"friend\" when I was 20, but I never wanted to go and say we were together, which really ticked him off, but I wasn't ready to say it. Your friend may not be ready to say it either.",

   "Wow, I can't believe I missed this thread. All one has to do is show acceptance. Be positive and supportive, when that is required. Coming out is very much an inner journey to be comfortable in one's own skin. Mostly just treat him like you have all along, like he is still the same person he has always been. He is, and I have a feeling you understand this very well.",
