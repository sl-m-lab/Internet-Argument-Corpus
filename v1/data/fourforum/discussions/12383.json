   "The DJ closed at 7350, up 236 point on the day. Fed Chairman Bernanke's testimony to the Senate Banking Committee was calm and reassuring without painting a rosy picture. As a result most markets responded well.\n \n It will be interesting to see tomorrow's reaction To Obama's presentation to the joint Congress. No doom and gloom please Mr. President, and no campaign speech. Don't listen to your pencil pushing Secretary of the Treasury or your other \"expert\" economic and political advisors. Speak from the heart, be honest and positive.\n \n The time has come to remember that you are the President of the United States and not the leader of liberals and left wing democrats.",

Not really.\n \n Anything funny? Yes Nancy Pelosi wildly applauding every sentence.\n \n Anything new? Yes, I didn't know that the automobile was invented in this country.\n \n As they say in the army, I think - SNAFU\n \n Thanks, but no thanks Mr. President",

She sure as heck ain't jumping up after the sermon to go buy him new clothes.\n \n And when you've got an economy that people are saying will be in the toilet until next year?
