   "Another attack on gays by this president. With support growing daily for the gay equality, I hope this turns on him. \n \n \n http://365gay.com/Newscon07/06/062707dc.htm\n \n (Washington) President Bush issued a warning to Congress on Wednesday that he will veto budget appropriations for the District of Columbia unless the measure contains language barring the district from using any of the money for its domestic partner registry.\n \n The registry allows same and opposite-sex unmarried couples to register their relationships.\n \n Three quarters of the District of Columbia's budget comes from local revenue - city taxes and fees. But, about $120 million in additional funds comes from the federal government. \n \n That money is contained in the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act. \n \n Under Republicans the legislation stated that none of the federal money could be used to support the partner registry. When Democrats took control of Congress the requirement was removed.\n \n In threatening a veto the White House on Wednesday issued a statement saying: \"The Administration strongly opposes the bill's exclusion of a longstanding provision that disallows the use of Federal funds to register unmarried, cohabitating couples in the District, to enable them to qualify for benefits on the same basis as legally married couples. Under Federal law, legal marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Federal tax dollars are not used to extend employment benefits to domestic partners of Federal employees, and D.C. should not enjoy an exception to this rule.\"\n \n The Domestic Partner registry includes such partner rights as hospital and nursing home visitations, medical decisions, and inheritance rights.\n \n \"With his popularity at an all time low, this President has yet again dipped his cup into the well of anti-gay bigotry,\" said Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese. \n \n \"He has issued a veto threat on funding for the District of Columbia because long-term, committed couples want to have such basic rights as visiting each other in the hospital and making medical decisions for their partner. The anti-gay zeal of this Administration has reached a new low.\"\n \n Gay Democrats seized on the veto threat as another example of wedge politics.\n \n \"This is a misleading veto threat designed to parrot the talking points of the anti-gay special interests which control and finance the Republican Party, said National Stonewall Democrats Executive Director Jo Wyrick, \n \n \"President Bush would never threaten to withhold federal funds from California because it employs a domestic partnership registry. Yet, Republicans feel that the District of Columbia is their financial playground that they can use to bully local families at the pleasure of their anti-gay agenda. That is wrong.\"\n \n The District of Columbia established a local domestic partnership registry in 1992. However, the Republican congressional leadership routinely prevented the registry from being enacted until 2002. \n \n Since that time, the Republican-led Congress have repeatedly attached anti-gay language to past appropriations bills which stipulate that federal funds cannot be used to operate the program. Since local funds are used, observers have noted that the provision was simply used as a way for Republicans to demonstrate their disapproval for the law and for same-sex families.\n \n The removal of the domestic partner provision from the financial services act came at the request of Congressman Jos\u00e9 Serrano (D-NY) and other Democrats. \n \n \"There are serious issues for the country to deal with, yet the President wants to focus on this,\" said Congressman Jos\u00e9 Serrano (D-NY) in a statement. \n \n \"This was a redundant provision that bashes the District of Columbia. There are no federal funds directed at the domestic partners registry. Its like putting out a statement that says that Jos\u00e9 Serrano is not a Republican. Yeah, we know that already. I took out this past provision because it is a bad statement that doesn't bring people together, but tries to divide them instead.\"\n \n Ironically the legislation also provides financial support for federal programs including the salary of the President.\n \n It is the second time in two months the president has threatened a veto over a gay issue.\n \n In May the White House said that if legislation adding gays and lesbians to federal hate crime laws the president would nix it.",

I see no more reason to do so in such cases than votes for anything other special interest group.\n\n Jyoshu, I am giving them an astonishing idea that their thoughts may ACTUALLY coincide with their actions.\n I am taking the *leap of faith* that they may not be hypocrites on this issue WITHOUT PROOF of such.\n \n I know. It's a bizarre concept for people's PUBLIC STATEMENTS on a matter actually aligning with their inner thoughts.\n I can understand why some have difficulty with that concept... emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nThe reason you should care, or at least be cognizant of the fact, is that it's the sort of thing to watch out for in that it can work against you at some point. But again, it's up to you. If you don't care about the motivations of your congresspeople, that's your business.\n\n \"work against me\"?\n Jyoshu, try to think of this logically for a minute.\n \n A) Person A states that homosexuals are an abomination. He votes against any domestic partner recognition, gays in the military, gay adoption, ...\n B) Person B states that he supports gay equality. He votes for domestic partner recognition, gays in the military, gay adoption, ...\n \n Now, you come along and tell me that Person B (with NO proof supplied by you) has an anti-gay inner core.\n Where does that leave me?\n Should I vote for Person A???\n Of course not.\n \n Should I vote for Person B, and then if any semblance of abandonment of a gay equality platform is seen, I can act upon that?\n Yes. Much more rational.\n \n So you see, you have conjured up a pretense of how a group MIGHT be thinking, and that leaves me exactly with WHAT action??? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n All this aside, what you are REALLY trying to do is boringly transparent... emoticon_cool \n \n \n \nNo, not exactly. Your view would attribute real benevolent intentions to one group, while mine would attribute the more realistic hunger-for-power motivation.\n\n No, jyoshu, you're wrong again.\n MY view would not care about their \"intentions\" at all.\n \n It's their ACTIONS which are important.\n Why get bogged down in trying to second guess how hypocritical they are WITH NO EVIDENCE???\n \n \n \nIt looks like our main difference here is that I tend to be cynical and suspicious of politicians in general when it comes to motivations, and apparently you're much more inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt on motivations (particularly when they vote the way you prefer on gay rights-related issues).\n\n Again, no.\n It's that I really don't care.\n \n Tell me Jyoshu. If a politician stepped forward who said he was going to vote for X, and you wanted him to vote for X, HOW MUCH would it change things if you suddenly found out that he didn't really want to vote for X?\n \n ESPECIALLY when his opponent did not support X???",

   "In retrospect, I think I am possibly beginning to understand a little bit more about the origins of Jyoshu's concern over *Democrats \"token\" voting gay, but opposing them in their hearts* rant.\n \n I think it comes from a mis-placed desire to apply REPUBLICAN fixation and scandals to the whole \"Democrat\" thing.\n I mean, there are a lot of gay republicans who are elected to office but they HAVE to stay in the closet. Being outed could mean the end of their career.\n And often, these closeted gay republicans support anti-gay measures. Consistent with the party line, but sacrificing ideals of self-equality in order to support prejudice and discrimination.\n \n And I think we can come up with a variety of examples along these lines. \n Both in and out of office.\n \n Another area of parallel is in the christian church itself. Like Haggard, who was avidly anti-gay, but gay in the closet. Just look at how Falwell and his fellow christian power-houses scurried away from the spotlight when it was shown on him!\n And ex-gays who revert, and then are subsequently abandoned and ignored? Don't get me started...\n \n Maybe THAT is why he thinks we should be overly concerned with the idea that democrat politicians may be inwardly opposed to how they are actually talking and voting?\n Because we should be more like Republicans and Christians who do so? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n And unlike Jyoshu's rantings, these are REAL LIFE examples.\n This is \"hard data\" as Jyoshu would put it.\n Stuff he claimed to have, but obviously has not yet produced... emoticon_rolleyes",

One might as well ask the condemned man to smile on his executioner.\n \n The Democrats aren't perfect, but in an imperfect but democratic world, you have to pick the least worst option, because the best isn't always going to be viable or available. Democrats won't do everything gay Americans need to have done, and they won't do it as quickly as one might wish, but at the very least, they'll cause less harm to gays than the GOP in its present state.\n \n And of course, there are so many other reasons not to support the GOP as well, that even gay voters who aren't single issue voters -- and few people really are -- have little incentive to vote GOP.",

   "I thought this would be the proper thread to post this.. It's pretty much a continuous of his anti-gay agenda to appease his shrinking religious base. \n \n http://www.hrcbackstory.org/hate_crimes/index.html\n \n \nToday, in another misguided swipe at the hate crimes bill, President Bush has again threatened to veto the Defense Authorization bill if it is sent to his desk with the hate crimes language, the Washington Times reported today: \n \n President Bush is committed to vetoing the latest effort to expand federal \"hate crimes\" laws to include sexual orientation, even if it means sending a defense authorization bill back to Congress, the White House said.\n \n \"The qualifications [in the bill] are so broad that virtually any crime involving a homosexual individual has potential to have hate crimes elements,\" said White House spokesman Tony Fratto....\n \n Mr. Fratto said the president, who has pushed for quick approval of spending for U.S. troops, would send the defense bill back to Capitol Hill if the hate-crime amendment remains attached.\n \n Obviously, this latest threat presents a legislative challenge for us to overcome. Keep in mind that the last time hate crimes passed in the Senate, we secured 65 votes. That makes a VERY strong statement. But that's why it's good to have friends in the leadership who will work with us to find a vehicle to get the hate crimes protections signed into law, as Joe Solmonese stated in a post at Bilerico: \n \n Progress on pro-GLBT legislation in this Congress is real, meaningful and significant. Congress often moves slower than people want or expect, so it is understandable that some grow frustrated when the final results are not immediate. In this Congress, we have already witnessed a heightened visibility and concern for GLBT issues that affect our community, including hate crimes. Senators Kennedy and Smith and the Senate Democratic Leadership remain committed to passage of the Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act this year. They are working with us to find ways to ensure enactment of the legislation. \n \n It's really sad, but apparently Bush never tires of catering to his base, despite the undeniable (and well publicized) loss of confidence in his judgment and leadership by the majority of Americans. It's not that complicated. In May, Gallup released a poll that showed overwhelming support for adding sexual orientation and gender identity to the new hate crimes law. There was strong support across demographic lines. There were just 26% of Americans against the new law. A recent Newsweek poll shows Bush's approval hovering around 29%. I bet if we ran the cross-tabs, we'd see they are the same people. George Bush is simply playing to his ever shrinking base - and against the wishes of most Americans who know how badly updated federal hate crimes laws are needed.\n\n \n \n \nConstitutional law professor calls the claims by religious conservatives that the hate crimes bill threatens free speech \"ridiculous\"\n August 23, 2007\n Chris Johnson\n A University of Chicago law professor with expertise in constitutional law, Geoffrey Stone, refutes the claims by members of the religious right that the hate crimes legislation threatens free speech in an editorial in the LA Times today. He grounds his arguments in three important points:\n \n For at least three reasons, this argument is completely unfounded. First, the Matthew Shepard Act would not prohibit \"attempts to incite.\" It would prohibit only the infliction of bodily harm and attempts to cause bodily harm. The latter refers to firing a gun and missing, not giving a sermon.\n \n Second, it is settled 1st Amendment law that an individual cannot constitutionally be punished for attempting to incite others to commit crimes unless the speaker expressly incites unlawful conduct and such conduct is likely to occur imminently. The last time the Supreme Court upheld a criminal conviction for incitement was more than half a century ago, in the case of Dennis vs. U.S., and that involved incitement to violent overthrow of the government. Unless the pastors intend to expressly incite wild-eyed mobs to beat up gays because of their sexual orientation, they are in no danger from this law.\n \n Third, the legislation expressly provides that \"nothing in this act . . . shall be construed to prohibit any expressive conduct protected\" by the 1st Amendment. In other words -- indeed, in the most explicit words possible -- the act could not be applied to the pastors unless their sermons are unprotected by the 1st Amendment, a concept that is impossible to imagine. \n \n The 1st Amendment protects the right of Nazis to march in Skokie, the right of racists to assert that blacks are inferior, the right of atheists to denounce Christianity and the right of homophobes to condemn homosexuality. The argument of the pastors that the proposed legislation in any way threatens their right to preach their version of the Gospel is, to be frank, ridiculous. \n \n Congress will be reconvening in a few weeks to wrap up unfinished business, including passing the Department of Defense reauthorization bill in the Senate that the hate crimes bill is currently attached to as an amendment. We know that the religious right will continue to fight the hate crimes bill each step of the way - and we'll be ready.\n",
