   "Well guys after a long and bitter struggle I've decided to move out. My dad has become abusive and has on more than one occasion gotten in my face and flipped over furniture and even sped on a side street at 90 mph with me in the car.\n \n Hes got serious anger issues and doesn't know I'm gay but opposes all issues with gays and think their horrible people. My mom doesn't accept it and my sis now hates me cause Ive come out to her. I feel threatened by my dad as hes already hit me on more than one occasion. I write this with sadness. I thought I could change my family but all I found was that I had changed while their still the same.\n \n Its not a matter of love but rather them getting over their issues. So I'm going to stay with a good friend who's partner I know for a couple of weeks. Then decide if I'm moving back with them to Norfolk. I'll give you an example. I went to a No on prop 8 rally today in Temecula.\n \n My dad was so ###### I was missing church for a \"lunch with friends.\" He flipped over a chair and got in my face and cussed me out right before going to church! Up until the point I was getting in my car he kept going until I though he would hit me for sure.\n \n I sped away scared and jarred remembering all the stuff he used to do to my mom as far as beating and hitting. All I know is that I'm not going to hide anymore and if I need to live my life away from them then so be it. I know how to be on my own, I was for over 2 years. It's sad I love them so much it hurts but I know that if I don't do this I'll jsut go back in the closet and hide.\n \n I refuse to. So I've packed most of my things and I will write a letter explaining everything to them. Wish me luck and even a prayer cause I'm gonna need it before this is over...",

   "Sorry to hear that Jason.\n \n My only advice would be \"Don't let it change who you are\". Keep trying to get into their good books, but stick to your guns (strange saying for Norfolk). If they can't accept you then it is their loss.\n \n Sounds like your dad needs help. But I wouldn't go there. It would probably do more harm than good.\n \n Shame about your sister, she seemed to be your biggest hope.\n \n I also wouldn't try too hard to convert your mum, because that might put her at odds with your dad, and end up hurting her in the long run.\n \n Best of luck.\n \n Smiley",

They both live in Norfolk which is where i used to live so I know the area very well. He's gonna be in a studio apt until the 8th so it will give me time to make a decision away from all the #### at home. \n \n I'm done trying to show them. If they want to that's their decision but as much as I know them I'll be disowned by my dad anyways.",

   "Well as a shock to myself and to all here I guess I better post what has happened thus far. I left a compassionate and caring yet firm letter to my dad and mom about everything. Yesterday my dad called me in the evening and what he said shocked me.\n \n He said he didnt care I was gay and that it was my choice. He said he loved me no matter what. And as far as his anger issues he had no idea he was causing me that much pain and he broke down saying he was sorry cause hes under alot of stress and that he just wanted his son back. \n \n I couldnt eve utter anywords because I thought it would be just the opposite. So I drove 90 miles back home last night and gave my dad a big hug. We talked a little today and he said he wants to understand and to talk more about me being gay. M mom, well I havnt seen her happier in a long long time.\n \n So I'm working on rebuilding my relationship with my dad one day at a time. Today I carved pumpkins with him and my sister while my mom went to work. He noticed my no on 8 sticker and said its fine its what you believe. I've never felt more at ease now because I can be totally open and I have nothing to hide now cause of his reactions.\n \n I know it will take time but I'm finally totally out now. Now it's just a matter of living my life and enjoying every minute.",
