   "I always have to chuckle whenever I see somebody claim that homosexuality is a choice.\n Truly. I mean, first, let's talk about that little thing called motive.\n \n If there is no such thing as what the social scientists call a \"homosexual orientation\"... no natural-born attraction, emotionally and sexually, to one's own gender... then that means we're all \"really\" heterosexual, i.e., attracted to the opposite sex. Right?\n \n So why would someone attracted to the opposite sex choose to deny that natural attraction, and instead have emotionally and sexually intimate relations exclusively with the gender that naturally repels them? What's the draw? Where's the percentage in it? (And let's not even talk about the wonderful fringe benefits of possibly being rejected by your family and friends and being reviled daily in the media by a slew of right-wing religionists, not to mention homophobic nutcases on fora like this. Ooh, yeah, can't wait to be gay and have people passing laws against me! What fun!) I mean, that's like saying, \"Oh, I love steak and potatoes, but I think from now on I'll restrict myself to eating ground glass!\" Make sense? Yeah, right. \n \n And what about those gay penguins, dolphins, Bonobo apes, etc? Did they make that same unmotivated, \"immoral\" choice?\n \n And no, the answer \"well, they're all sick\" doesn't cut it. \"Sickness\" isn't \"choice\"... and no reputable doctor thinks gays are sick anymore, anyway. People do things for reasons. They don't have sex repeatedly and exclusively with the same gender unless they want to. Exactly the same reason that heterosexuals have for doing so with the opposite sex. They wouldn't want to unless they were biologically disposed to want to.\n \n As this point, the \"choice\" proponent usually \"does a little sidestep\" and switches gears into the popular Straw Man Argument: \"Oh, I didn't mean you choose your attraction (uh-huh, right... sure you didn't), I meant you choose to engage in sexual acts.\" Well... DUH! Who's arguing we don't? (HINT: No one.) Everyone does, gay or straight. So what? Why shouldn't we? Why should we be celibate because you think what we do--and believe me, toots, it's EXACTLY what a lot of straight people are gonna be doing tonight--is \"icky\"??\n \n At which point they usually turn to Biblical rationalizing, lacking any logical explanation as to why the same acts, expressing the same level of love and gratification, is moral when performed by some genders, but not by others.",

But taking it leads them to a cruel and untenable position. Gay people should be expected to exercise \"discipline of restraint\" by not engaging in \"homogenital behavior.\" In other words, homosexuals should be celibate or should fool heterosexuals into marrying them.\n \n This is an astonishing demand. Homosexuality is not about what you do in bed, it is about whom you fall in love with. The authors assert that issues of human sexuality should not be viewed as mere \"matters of recreation or taste,\" and of course they are right. I know of no homosexual who regards his love as a \"matter of recreation or taste,\" any more than heterosexuals do. Human beings need food, they need shelter, they need love; love is a constitutive human need. That is why homosexuals view the social repression of their love not as the discouragement of a whimsical vice but as an act of scalding inhumanity.\n http://www.indegayforum.org/news/show/26892.html",

That's certainly evidence that religionists don't think of this as an issue of innateness, but rather of choice, as I've been saying.\n\n \n What Jyoshu said: \"No, no, I am saying that for religionists who oppose you, whether or not homosexuality is innate is completely irrelevant. And many probably don't believe it is innate anyway. That's what I'm saying.\"\n \n The second part was accurate. Many believe a lie. Many believe that it is not innate, when it clearly is. Many believe it to be a choice, when it is clearly not.\n In fact, studies have shown that people who believe homosexuality is a choice are much more likely to be against gay equality.\n \n \n The FIRST part is entirely inaccurate. It's not \"completely irrelevant\".\n Over and over again I hear the argument from anti-gay sources claiming that the \"black / gay\" analogy must be invalidated because being black is not a choice.

Remember?\n I invited you to debate my \"proof\", which was my personal classification of \"prejudice\". You refused to do so.\n 2) It's still not proving a negative. The issue becomes debating the VALIDITY of the classification. That's not the same as proving a negative.\n I don't think you understand what \"proving a negative\" means in the first place.\n I can prove that I am NOT the only one in the room where I am at right now. I could take pictures of myself and others to show I am not alone in this room.\n \"Proving a negative\" doesn't just mean having to prove something where there is a \"not\" in the argument, which seems to be your interpretation of what it means...\n \n Do you understand that it IS POSSIBLE to argue that somebody is not \"prejudiced\" by arguing the validity of the classification itself?\n Ergo, if proving a negative is impossible, logically that cannot be an example of it?\n \n Do you get that?\n \n \n \nBut I'm sure you won't accept that, if your past intolerance of explanations is any indication.\n\n Context is everything Jyoshu.\n There was a purpose to the contentions and the importance that I discussed.\n A reminder is above.\n \n I'm not the one who was misunderstanding here.\n And if you would actually DEBATE THE POINT instead of whining over my observation, we could get somewhere.\n You do realize that, don't you?",

   "\n I know 2 people who used to be afraid of rabbits and aren't anymore. If you face a fear you can overcome it. I used to be afraid of many things and I'm not anymore. A psychologically learned thing can be psychologically unlearned. I'll post more later, I have to get offline for the rest of today.\n\n \n \nGood then you should have no problem over comming your heterosexuality, if as you say it is just a choice. Go ahead stop being a heterosexual.\n\n \n That is ridiculous. That's like telling someone to overcome being sober. Being sober is how people naturally are, the alcoholics are the ones who need to do the overcoming. Being straight is like being sober and being gay is like being an alcoholic. The alcoholic has the problem, so he needs to do the fixing. The sober one is normal and therefore doesn't need to do anything. It's the same way with gays. They are the ones with the problem, and they are the ones who need to overcome it. Of course if politics and the media told an alcoholic he was completely normal and everybody else was just prejudice, then he would never quit drinking. That is what is happening in America. Gays are being deceived into thinking homosexuallity is completely normal. They won't quit being gay because they like being gay, similar to the way a drunkard likes being drunk. That doesn't make it right though. It's all about resisting temptation. Since gays have been deceived into thinking they are normal, they don't think they need to quit.\n \n Nobody just chooses to be gay. They are coaxed into believing they are gay and that it is normal. They choose to believe the lie and let themselves be deceived. That is what the choice is. They choose to stay gay and believe a lie. \n \n \n \n \nIf it wasn't a choice then people wouldn't go back and forth from being gay and being straight. If it was natural or part of someone then they would know it from birth and wouldn't ever \"find out\" that they are gay. Saying it is how they are born is one of the most idiotic arguements ever and I consider that to be one of the biggest LIES ever implemented into our society.\n\n \n \nDid you ever think that they are afraid to come out because of attitudes such as the one being displayed? I say then that one is lying if they say they where born a heterosexual. It is hard to come out as being gay if you are afriad you are going to get beat up. It is hard to come out if you are told by your parents, society, and evil christian religious sects that being gay is somehow wrong.\n\n \n \n \n Your continual remarks of Christians as being evil shows how deceived you really are. I could say all gays are evil, but I just say they are wrong. Rather than say that you think Christians have a wrong belief, you go ahead and say they are all evil which is a rather ignorant approach. \n \n Once again, if being gay was natural or normal then nobody would \"find out\" they are gay. They would know it from birth. Nobody would switch back and forth from being gay and straight. They would stay as whichever one was natural to them from birth. It doesn't work that way though, because being gay isn't natural or normal.",

Most alcoholics decide to quit when THEY have decided it's time to quit. After so many mishaps due to alcohol a person realizes that their drinking needs to stop.\n \n \n That is what is happening in America. Gays are being deceived into thinking homosexuallity is completely normal. They won't quit being gay because they like being gay, similar to the way a drunkard likes being drunk.\n \n \n \n Gays are not deceived into thinking homosexuality is completely normal. They already know it is completely normal, that is why they are gay. You have been deceived into thinking homosexuality is abnormal. And heterosexuality is normal. The majority of people are heterosexual, but a majority does not determine normal or abnormal.\n \n \n \n That doesn't make it right though.\n \n \n Opposite or same sex attraction in and of itself is not right or wrong. It is the individual with the same or opposite sex attraction that determines what type of human being he or she is.\n \n \n It's all about resisting temptation. Since gays have been deceived into thinking they are normal, they don't think they need to quit.\n \n \n \n Temptation is chocolate when you're on a diet. We are talking about real people and their real lives. I repeat gay people are normal, and do not need to quit. However there are gay people that have been deceived into thinking that they are not normal. They make all kinds of attempts to quit. Some even deceive heterosexual women into believing they are in love with them. They would rather lie to themselves and somebody else then be considered abnormal. \n \n \n \n \n Nobody just chooses to be gay. \n \n \n \n \n you are correct.\n \n \n \n \n They are coaxed into believing they are gay and that it is normal. \n \n \n \n \n You are incorrect. First of all where, when, and how does one get coaxed into believeing they are gay? Most gay people could care less whether or not it is normal, it is part of who they are. The few who do care about the fact that others do not consider it normal are the ones who attempt opposite sex relationships and programs that claim to cure homosexuality.\n \n \n \n \n \n They choose to believe the lie and let themselves be deceived.\n \n \n \n I hate to burst your bubble but your information is a bit inaccurate. I am a homosexual who was never told a thing about homosexuality. It was always there, just like my earlobes. No lies were ever told therefore, deception is not part of this equation. Did your heterosexuality come as a result of lies and deception?\n \n \n \n That is what the choice is. They choose to stay gay and believe a lie. \n \n \n \n You need to interview a whole lot of homosexuals. Real ones, if you want the truth. Not ex-gays, not celebate gays, and not closet queens with wives and families. Homosexuals who realize their sexuality is a facet of their being which is neither good or bad, right or wrong, normal or abnormal.\n \n \n \n Your continual remarks of Christians as being evil shows how deceived you really are. I could say all gays are evil, but I just say they are wrong.\n \n \n \n The offensive strike from conservative Christian groups is evil in regards to equal rights for gay people. \n \n \n \n Rather than say that you think Christians have a wrong belief, you go ahead and say they are all evil which is a rather ignorant approach.\n \n \n \n Christians have the right belief for Christians. But imposing their beliefs on others is both evil and ignorant. \n \n \n \n Once again, if being gay was natural or normal then nobody would \"find out\" they are gay. They would know it from birth.\n \n \n We do know it from birth, it is Christian propaganda that says anything to the contrary. You will only find the truth about this issue by going to the source. Homosexuals are the source. They have no reason to lie about this issue. They do not want to be heterosexuals. They do not want to be Christians. They do not want to be \"normal people\" like you and those who share your mindset. They want to live decent, meaningful, and prosperous lives, free of harrassment and/or inequality. Life,liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as gauranteed in the Declaration of Independence.\n \n \n Nobody would switch back and forth from being gay and straight. \n \n \n The only reason people switch is out of fear. Fear based on their religious beliefs, fear of being thrown out by their family and /or friends, fear of not being normal, etc.\n \n \n They would stay as whichever one was natural to them from birth. It doesn't work that way though, because being gay isn't natural or normal.\n\n \n \n \n You certainly are consistent with your misinformation. Unless you are a homosexual you have no idea whether being gay is natural or normal. I cannot tell you anything about heterosexuality first hand because I am a homosexual who knows nothing about it. However I don't think it's natural or normal for a heterosexual such as you to be so obsessed with homosexuality. It doesn't concern you.",

I know many heterosexual men who are comfortable with gay people, who do not have a problem with their sexuality. It is only the ones who are struggeling that raise comparisons and premises such as yours. Some of gay peoples worse enemies are gay people themselves too scared and frightened by bigoted evil religious beliefs to come out. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Your continual remarks of Christians as being evil shows how deceived you really are.

I know many gay men just like me. What you see as people switching back and forth are those weak people buckeling under to society's pressure to be heterosexual. They do not want to loose freinds and family, a job, their f'uped <term that has been banned< church. You after all have compared being gay to alcoholism and there are many out there who compare us to worse.

   "I think the only issue, in my eyes, lies with the \"unnatural\" nature of homosexuality. Homosexuality is quite obviously NOT the way nature intended human beings to reproduce (or any sexually reproducing species of animal, for that matter). In my humble opinion, that is the one thing homosexuals cannot really argue -- that they are \"natural\" or \"normal\" -- because no homosexual couple has ever had compatible reproductive organs that successfully produced offspring.\n\n \n Natural is not a good thing, necessarily. One could argue that a lot of things we humans do are not natural. It is extremely rare to see monogamous animals. Yet we as humans value monogamy highly. Reproduction may be natural, but it isn't a positive, either. One needn't be reproducing to be natural. Animals involved in kin selection do not reproduce. I hope you are not confusing what is natural or normal with what is good or bad. Nature doesn't create ethics, humans do. \n \n \nThere is no CONCRETE evidence indicating there is a 'gay gene' yet, though the verdict is still out on that one, but according to the theory of natural selection, nature would select AGAINST homosexuals thriving if it were entirely genetic. Why? Because they would never reproduce more of themselves. Therefore it must at least be the reluctant choice of some homosexuals to engage in heterosexual relationships that keeps the homosexual population going.\n\n \n Yet it does still exists, as a trait. Genes have different rates of penetrance. Many could be carrying around a gay gene and passing it on, but only some of those who have the gene will be gay. Assuming the last part is true, all that needs to be done to end gayness, is to accept gays, and not apply social pressure to enter a hetero relationship. There are bi-sexuals. Not every straight person who has had same-sex experiences is gay. One's sexual actions are not necessarily always related to issues of one's sexual identity, as in being or seeing one's self as gay or straight.\n \n \nIf that's not it, then homosexuality MUST be a choice, and therefore can be chosen against.\n\n \n And can be chosen for!\n \n \nBut then, did something in your life force you into this choice, without your knowing? Might you have been heterosexual if you had different circumstances with your childhood, family, etc.?\n\n \n Who knows? People are who they are. \n \n \nIn summary, and please take no offense to the way this sounds, but I do think there is an abnormality of some type involved, whether it be physical or psychological,\n\n \n Similar to redheads and quasi-vegetarians.",

   "Lets see cinderella goes to the ball to meet the prince. The prince falls in love with her. The prince looks for her. The prince finds her and marries her.\n \n Heterosexual propaganda. Now if this is not true then you should be abale to interchange the sexes of the characters. So if it is just \"symobolizm, imagery, foreshadowing...etc\" then there should be nop problem with prince and prince or if cinderella is a boy and the prince marries a boy.\n\n \n Didn't I just say that so long as your are teaching the concepts and not the story? You can have a whale and bunny marry for all I care.\n \n \nI am not sure that you and I are agreeing on the meanings of the words implicit or tacit. I mean them as that message that is not spoken of, but by mutual understanding of the cultural cirmcumstance, it is still conveyed. I don't understand how there cannot be tacit approval of heterosexual norms when you discuss examples of them.\n Perhaps one may inquire into the reality of racism after reading To Kill a Mockingbird but I don't recall the morality of the situation coming up. Cinderalla doesn't imply \"gays are bad\" anyway. The moral message was not about being heterosexual in that story so there is no \"implicit\" message as their may be in Cinderalla. The only implicit message is that one does not need to have riches and fame to be beautiful. \n \n Furthermore, this story was not read in school and to think it is \"hetero propaganda\" is just insane.",

That's dumb.\n \n You'll note that the pro-gay person refuted the NATURAL claim as the BASIS for the \"bad\" conclusion.
