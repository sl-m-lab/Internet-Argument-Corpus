   "How would this work?\n \n I understand that it was originally intended to redistribute land so that everyone got a fair share of land to cultivate, but would it involve other property and financial assets?\n\n \n The theology behind the Jubilee is that because the land is YHWH's and Israel his tenants, it is not theirs to sell in perpetuity. Thus, ones inherited plot should be inalienable, and is returned (if sold) every 50th (or 49th) year. As Philo writes in Spec. Leg. 2.22, \"He [Moses] thinks it fitting that all property that has been alienated should now be restored to its original masters in order that the inheritances originally apportioned to the different tribes may be preserved, and that no one who originally received an allotment may be wholly deprived of his possessions.\" This notion is attested all over peasant societies.\n \n The equal distribution of land was another concern, as in, e.g., various prophetic condemnations of people gobbling up the patrimony of the poor.\n \n It only seems to have involved land (though the Sabbatical year involved debts and slaves, in principle) and there is no convincing evidence it was practiced in the Second Temple period. Indeed, some people have argued that it was never practiced.",

Leviticus 25 is the ultimate source for the practice and briefly describes the idea behind it: \"...the land shall not be sold in perpetuity for the land is mine and you are strangers and sojourners with me.\"",
