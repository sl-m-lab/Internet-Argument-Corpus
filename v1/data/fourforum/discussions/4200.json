Good things seem to just clamber at their feet, unhindered by normal standards of hard work or ingenuity. When that happens we wonder - why them and not us? The Bible tells us that God's grace covers and includes everyone - evil and good - and that He is no respecter of persons. Sometimes we feel the need to blame something or someone when actually that is just the ways things are. A person gains power, money, influence, etc., by certain means whether through good or evil processes. And, yes, it could be due to their worldly knowledge or just due to them being at the right place at the right time or doing the right thing at the right time - but even that takes a certain amount of wisdom.\n \n As far as people being predestined to follow Christ:\n I can't give you the scriptures as a detailed explanation, but in Ephesians 1:11 we are told,  In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will...\n And in John 10:28 - 30 Jesus says,  And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are one.\n This will take pages and pages and post after post to explain fully, so I regret that I can't, alone, give you all the information that you want and need to understand it. But, I will try to boil it down a little.\n There was a time, in another earth-age, when Lucifer tried to kill God and take His place. During this war there were souls that chose Lucifer, those that chose God and those that chose to remain neutral. To those that chose the Evil One, their souls are to have a human body, not knowing their previous state, and live as humans, again never knowing their previous state, and die never accepting Christ. These are the ones that are predestined to hell, where they will perish. Those that chose to join God during the war their souls also will have a human body, also not knowing their previous state, and live as humans unknowing that they are God's elect and will die and be saved. Those that remained neutral will be born and have the option to choose this time around which they will follow: God or the devil. These also will never know their previous state and will die and receive what they chose while alive: Death or Life.\n In Jude, verse 4 we are told,  For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. So, there is much to glean from the Bible that most religionists don't care to touch on. Catholics, more especially, have a more detailed understanding of these things since they have better resources - maybe Maximus can help some. I don't know why Protestants and Catholics can't have the same Bible....but, that's why I'm not a religionist.\n Sorry for the short explanation, Greg, but I hope that clears up some of it.",

Why would an all-knowing, merciful god reject them because their reason (which he gave them), would not allowthem to accept the supernatural without evidence?\n\n \n Well, Trebor I had to read this one a couple of times to be sure I was getting it right. :) \n \n I know there is no relationship to a persons \"works\" here on earth, and spiritual matters. Works and beliefs can be merged to gain a higher level of spirituality, but the bible says no man can enter the KOH though works alone. ( my read on it anyway) I can see your logic ( a bad word to use in a religion forum) of course, about your analogy of God not creating a person that did NOT have the \"design\" or capability of a spiritual quest built in to them. ...\n \n But that scenario would mean that God would be playing \"favorites\" when he passed out the soul list, some would get to be injected with the thirst for knowledge of Christ, some would not have any interest at all. That would be a disturbing conclusion to my original thread topic , and would prove in itself, than predestination is in fact a fallacy........\n \n After reading and trying to comprehend the numerous replies on this forum pertaining to this type of question, I think EF has the best conclusion. Maybe we are all born spiritually \"dead\" , then though our own actions while living out life here on earth, we will have it awakened by something happening in our lives. Then at that point in our life, maybe though a family member, a friend, a skit on TV, a BBS forum or even a clergy, we get exposed to the Bible . Then, because it is the \"engine\" that drives us to the truth in Christ, we just either move on with it or as some do, just turn the key off and park it. :) all jmo",

   "The big thing about predestination, and biblical statements are that the individual is predestined, is the \"to mark out a boundary. It does not obviate or eliminate individual choice. Instead it allows a range of choice. Big O refers to the elect, the chosen, and he is right. That does not stop the requirement that an individual choose God. \n \n Most important though, is that none of us, not one, knows who is and is not elected. Scripture does say that it is God's will that none SHOULD perish. If they do, it is by their choice as God prepared a way in Christ. That is the doctrine as I understand it.\n \n greg: I will try to get you better scripture references. Give me a day or two.\n \n EF",

   "ok, ef, if you happen to be one of those that are chosen, what responsibility do you have of your own life? if you are individually predestined to be anything at all, how can not be it? the problem with predestination on an individual level is that it does affect free will. if we are only able to make decisions within a marked-out boundary, then free will doesnt exist, or it is at least severely impaired. \n \n the question is, what responsibility do i have for my actions if free will doesnt exist for me? if i truly believe that i can only do what God predestined for me to do, and nothing more, then regardless of what i do, my justification can be 'God made me do it\", and rightly so\n \n the other counterproductive thing about believing in predestination is that there is no way of knowing if you are chosen, if you are fullfilling your destiny, and if the choices you make are within the boundaries youre supposed to be in. for instance, say a preacher - who is convinced that he is both chosen of God and making decisions within the boundry of God's marking - falls into the seduction of a prostitute and his ministry is totally ruined. would you say that his actions were within God's boundaries? and if not, was he predestined in the first place? and if not, was he ever even a chosen one?",

   "Another thing, Greg:\n Who is to say who are the elect? Who is to say who is predestined to die or predestined to live? That is not the message we are to haggle over. The message is that God wants us all to choose life - He (in my opinion) even begs it.\n \n I agree with epaphras faith that God's plan of salvation cannot be changed - we all have to go through Christ. The message is clear on that. What is not clear is why. Why not just have faith and believe in the God of Abraham and go to Heaven? I think it's because that's been tried and we have failed miserably. We can't do it. We had to have the blood of sheep and goats.\n \n Back to those predestined.\n As said, no one knows if he or she is \"of the elect\", but God does. Will He give them that extra boost? I don't think so. They are required to live according to the Word of God...but the kicker is...their spirit knows it. No, their brain, their carnal mind doesn't, but their spirit does. The spirit of evil will render evil, of good, goodness. Somewhere along the way those predestined either way will ultimately make that choice via free will. Can a soul predestined for hell get to Heaven? I think so. Jesus spoke about those that will force their way into Heaven. Can those predestined for Heaven die? Again, I think so. There is only one way, as the Bible states, and it's through Christ. But, God knows his creation and, unfortunately, knows that mankind kills his unborn. Will God place those predestined to live forever in those murdered unborn? I think so - if only to assure their direct passage. What about those dead in the womb? Those aborted due to massive complications? Those whom have died young? There are so many ways God can assure His elect can go from life to life...or from death to death.\n \n Then how can a person explain to others about the Elect of God without going into great detail; an explanation that will satisfy all? I don't have a clue. If it's not spelled out, written in simple terms, then I can't point anyone in that direction. It is not put in simple terms so that the Evil One cannot easily sidetrack the children of God - that's what I believe. Each person has to parlay with God in that respect.\n \n If it may help, the Bible says that one-third of the angels (not souls) chose Lucifer over God and was cast from Heaven with Lucifer. That means that two-thirds of the angels (not souls) remained true to God. What is not clear is how many souls, in the first earth-age, (1) chose to remain true to God, (2) chose to help kill Him, or (3) was indecisive. No one on earth will ever know.",

In this way they could see Him, His Majesty, His Ways, and love him for what He is. He gave them the ability to make up their own minds. (Stick with me, now, because you have to push away the carnal mind, which could get entangled here.) He wanted to be God of all things (and is), but He wanted the angels to freely want Him to be, so He gave them that choice. He loved Lucifer just as much as the rest but gave Lucifer the highest honor of being the angel of praise and worship. Soon Lucifer saw all that praise and worship given so freely to God and wanted it for himself. So he lied, deceived, and manipulated certain angels in order to gain the throne. This started the war in Heaven.\n Now, back to the \"elect\".\n I never said that our spirit couldn't be changed. I said we are given whatever spirit we are given. How God determines that is anybody's guess. As a matter of fact the Bible tells us that after the Holy Spirit comes upon us we are different creatures. I take that to mean body, mind and spirit. Have you ever noticed that when the downtrodden, the hopeless, the defeated, the walking-dead, accept Christ that their life changes? That's what I mean by body, mind and spirit, not that they actually transformed physically, literally - as in their features. \n Why is the effort needed? God saw that His creation was choosing sides. There were angels and the heavenly host, which I take to be living beings, but not angels. If I am wrong, someone can correct me. Of the angels the Bible says 1/3 chose to fight with Lucifer, 2/3 for God. Of the heavenly host some (I can't find a percentage here) chose Lucifer, some God and some chose to be neutral. The short of it, God won and cast Lucifer and his angels from Heaven. For the host, he figured (in His infinite wisdom, somehow), that this could occur again and instead of dealing with it in Heaven as before that He would create a world, the earth, for their next home, a place where they could live without any thought of their previous state. The only catch is this time they would be given the opportunity to choose God or Lucifer and that would end the war, forever. To help all of His creation, even those that fought against Him, He would make the promise of Christ, to cover them in His blood. Also He would write down the name of those that fought with Him and remember them.\n So He setup rules.\n For those that chose Lucifer, he would give them the same opportunity as all the rest...but, these He hates. Again, you must stay with me here, because as the world hates, God does not, and we don't know nor can we conceive how God hates, so it is with the Holy Spirit that we must stick or cling to in order to understand it. So, when we think of human beings, we tend to think of some loving child born of a loving mother and father, but that is not necessarily the case. We must think \"outside the box\", into the everlasting, and from the basis of life before this generation. Surely you have seen those that have the spirit of evil? These are the ones whose main objective is to turn away the hearts of the people from God. These are the ones Jude spoke of, those \"marked out for this condemnation\" before the foundation of the world.\n \n For those that chose God, he wants to save them from enduring this world, but due to His word, He can't, so He must allow them to spend a certain amount of time in the flesh. Again, I don't know how many there are or how long they must endure - maybe some die in the womb, maybe some die at a young age - I don't know...yet. Some of these \"elect\" are those that were unmercifully killed during the war in Heaven. But, still, they must endure this world in some fashion.\n \n For those that were indecisive in the first generation, He gives them the opportunity to choose one last time in whom will be their lord.\n For all, it is either eternal life or death; the sort of death that erases that soul forever, as if they never existed.\n So, why the effort? To end the war, to bring about the peace that God once had, with those who choose God as the Lord.\n \nhmmm... this by itself could start a thread of its own. from the human perspective, there is no discernible pattern to anything God does. even if God does have a purpose and divine order, it is completely whimsical in our view, because there is no rule or condition that must be met for God to do something. for instance, God's granting of an \"elect\" spirit may be based on cosmic alignment, a weather peculiarity, or a old man's sneeze. in fact, God is \"sovereign\" so he answers to noone and needs not follow a pattern or rule. for all practical purposes, this is whimsical behavior\n\n No, there is a reason for all that He does, and whether we can see it or not, it is done in perfect order, with perfect intentions.\n \nit sounds as though souls are recycled...\n\n It does sound that way, but, like I said, in humanistic fashion we tend to only think from the \"cradle to the grave\".

   "if we werent chosen by God, can we subsequentially choose God? \n and if we are chosen by God, can we subsequentially not choose God? \n \n if the choice we make about God must align with the choice God has made for us, then who is doing the choosing? \n \n and if we can choose independently of God's choice for us, who has the final say?\n - if we have the final say, then what difference does God's choice make?\n - if God has the final say, then what difference does our choice make?\n\n \n To answer your first two questions, Yes. To be more clear, you are still thinking temporally (linear time). God does not. Imagine you are a two dimensional square. You know the dimensions of left and right and forward and back. Or length and width. You know nothing of height. NO up or down exists. It is simply not there. You cannot see it, touch it. Your mathematicians can theorize it, but it cannot be sensed. Although you make actually measure it's passage. Such as it is 4up, \"time\" to go to work. They woudl measure it like we do time. No ability to manipulate it though. Now imagine a sphere comes along and talks to you. You would hear the voice coming from inside of you. when you see the sphere you see only what is in the plane where you live. If it is sitting on top of your plane you see a point. If it is halfway above and below you see a circle. Now that sphere picks you up and moves you up and down through it's full height. You see a point grow to a circle getting bigger and bigger until you reach the middle when it shrinks again down to a point and then reverses as you are put \"down\".\n \n The sphere understands up and down. You don't. It can manipulate it, you cannot. This is how I visualize the concept of God in relation to me. God is outside of and inside of time, just like the sphere exists both in the plane of the square and outside of it.\n \n There are biblical passages that hint at this \"To God a day is as a thousand years and a thousand years is but a day.\" and so on.\n \n Think as if there is no time. That eliminates the \"this must occur before that\" arguments altogether. The fact is that they both are. They are paradoxical to us, because of our limited perspective. They are perfectly logical for God who is, who was, and who is to come.\n \n Hope this helps. See Edwin Abbot's \"Flatland\" for further reading on this. It is also a neat social commentary, but a fun exercise in dimensional thinking.\n \n EF",

If a priori some \"destination\" has been assigned, where does choice come into the matter ?\n\n Phillip, the king of Nauntanaum, has established his first government. All citizens are equal and of every nationality on earth. There is no person greater than the next. But there needs to be committees of different sorts to regulate and to maintain order. King Phillip's first command was to give Fredrick the office of Good Times. Fred loved this position and cherished it. Everyone joined in on the Good Times, which also pleased King Phillip greatly. Soon Fred saw how the Good Times were reflecting positively on the king and became jealous. He wanted to be King of Nauntanaum so badly that he began spreading false rumors, telling lies, and deceiving the populace. After this Fred called all the committee members who were in agreement with him into overthrowing the government by killing King Phillip. The committee members also talked many citizens into joining the coup. On the day of the uprising King Phillip confronted Fred and told him that he knew about the plan. Fred looked over the shoulder of King Phillip and saw thousands upon thousands of committee members and thousands upon thousands of citizens. To his right he saw no committee members, but thousands of citizens, flop-jawed, staring at the opposing forces. He begged them to join him, but they remained indifferent and silently strode away. \n King Phillip pulled his sword, pointed towards the north, and stated that Fredrick and his committee will be banished to Terranacqua. And it was done.\n At the subsequent meeting King Phillip told the committee members loyal to him that it is apparent that something has gone awry in the kingdom, something that should never have happened. He had given them all they desired, they longed for nothing, they needed no money for he gave freely, still some rebelled. To prevent it from happening again he must send all the citizens to Terranacqua so that they can make up their minds once and far all. All those that go to Terranacqua will be given the choice of whom will be their king - Fredrick, Lord of Terranacqua or Phillip, King of Nauntanaum.\n But, he stated, those that chose to fight with Fredrick will not be punished this time, but will be given the chance to change their mind. That goes for those that chose to remain neutral, and although he hated to do it, those loyal to him also.\n On the journey from Nauntanaum to Terranacqua the citizens would cross the Land of Memancanza where they would lose all memory of their previous life. This would place all the citizens on a level plane. But, King Phillip gave them all a mark, not against them, but for keeping up with who did what during the rebellion. This was for his benefit and his alone. And he gave them a book, one that would tell them who the King of Nauntanaum was and who the Lord of Terranacqua was.\n \n When the citizens reached Terranacqua those that chose Fredrick, seemed to again choose him, those that remained neutral, did so in that land, and those that chose Phillip, seemed destined to choose him once more. But, there were some that chose differently, not many, but some. King Phillip did not pull strings one way or the other, but sent many messengers with good news who were later killed by certain citizens. This went on for years until one day King Phillip decided to set foot into Terranacqua himself...to spread the good news and tell them what that book was all about. He knew of their condition, how their memory of Nauntanaum was taken away and to tell them who they really were would defeat the purpose of sending them here. But, he did tell them that there were some there that he *already knows, and if they would listen to their hearts, would know his **voice. \n I hope this analogy hits the mark, because honestly, it was the best that I could do...even though it falls short in my opinion of the full scope of the question. For that I apologize.\n *John 10:27\n **John 18:37\n \nHere's another question: doesn't predestination presume the idea of some future destination (obviously) ? Where/what precisely is the \"destination\" that has been preordained ? Is it Heaven ? Is it Hell ? Is it merely Purgatory ? Could it even be Limbo ?\n\n We are all predestinated to come home to God through Christ. The sacrifice made by Christ covers all mankind. It is that predestination, that promise of life forever that we are given. When we are born we start that journey - some take it effortlessly, some have to really work at it, some never make it. The hard part to realize is that we all can make that effortless journey through grace, which never ceases, we just don't understand how. We tend to want to make everything a little more complicated, a little more logical, due to our carnal condition.\n There are even those that say to talk about this thread is fruitless because knowing about such as this is useless, or, at best, ineffectual. I happen to disagree. I think if the knowledge of God can be gained in any arena that it should be pursued - even through science. I will not be the one to put boundaries on learning, especially about the Lord.",

He had nothing to do with your choice then and He will not interfere with your ability to choose now.\n \n I will use the numerous passages of scripture that says that God gets angry and He gets glad about certain decisions we make. If a person, even God, knew what was going to happen before it happened why would he become angry or glad. And, if He knew our detailed future or our specific choices why would He have sent us through this earth-age?\n \n BTW - I am still working on that analogy. I have had to go back and redo it twice now. It's a hard thing to do, harder than I expected.\n\n thank you. God does not know what individuals will choose. people have free will, even if it means going against God's original intentions. people's choices overrides God's choice (actually, God doesnt choose, he just leads and expects us to follow, knowing that whether we follow is up to us)\n \n i still disagree with the heavenly host analagy/theory. but i think the predestination/free will issue is settled",

Do you agree?\n The only way we can wrap our minds around this and make sense of it is to use logical scenarios, statistical data, or our own beliefs. In doing so we develop what we call faith-based profiles in which we analyze certain events and/or beliefs. Some we analyze to death while others are still on the fringes of discovery. This process is performed by both believers and non-believers.\n What we fail to understand during this analysis is that some humans are born for destruction (or for the purpose to bring about God's plan in a certain way). To some this may seem barbaric, but in reality there will always be circumstances where evil is required in order for good to prevail.\n Take Judas for instance. His spirit was in collusion with the powers of darkness. He was born with that spirit so it could not have been given \"in place of\" that which he was born at some later date. All through his life he was predestined to betray God so that \"the son of perdition\" could carry out his deeds. He wasn't the first and he will not be the last of the \"sons of perdition\". According to scripture the last of these evil spirits will be in the form of one that will be revealed only when a great \"falling away\" from God occurs.\n Furthermore, speaking of those that will die before and during birth, young, mentally retarded and in isolated regions, only God knows if their spirit was given with predestined life or predestined death. He can choose those as He wishes; He has his own reasons. But, I believe He has a right to save whom He saves and condemn whom He condemns because of what happened in the first earth-age. With that said, I can only imagine what kind of damage can be done and on what scale if one of the chief coconspirators of Lucifer's murderous plot were to be born.\n So, yes, I believe not only are some sent straight to eternal life, but that some are sent straight to eternal death without ever being given the chance to change their character.",

   "What happens to those that have been destined to be saved, but never fit all the necessary criteria or even try to be saved ?\n\n Jesus made it clear that the only way to eternal life was through Him. If a soul that was predestined were to somehow get so infected with evil that he or she turned completely around from that predestinated path, denied the Holy Spirit, and gave all to the powers of darkness, then their choice would supercede that predestination.\n \n But I believe, through scripture, that those He predestined He calls early in their life and they hear Him clearly. After that acknowledgement God will justify that person and then glorify them. Once this happens it's like anything else that is established in one's life - it's a certainty; it works, and that is their life.\n The way I see it: God will not predestine a doubtful soul for eternal life, and our souls are what we are really all about. How a person's heart (or spirit-man) reacts to certain situations is how that person reacts physically. In other words I don't think it's possible for a person to act contrary to his or her inner being. Sure, I think we all make mistakes, we all do things out of character, we all sin and fall short of the glory of God, but that doesn't mean we necessarily remain in that sinful state.\n \n Remember that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. So many times we get confused by that passage of scripture (Romans 10:17) and read it that faith comes by listening to someone or from us while reading the Bible. But if you read it closely you'll find that it's not the Bible's words, but through the Bible we learn to listen to God. Those who are predestined to eternal life hear from God at an early age, \"before the evil days come\".\n \n There are those (like myself) who tend to rebel, and then suffer through the evil days before listening.",
