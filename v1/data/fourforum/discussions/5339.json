   "This pretty much sums up my feeling about Europe. Going into the tank. Socialism doesn't work. It has never worked and it will never work. \n =============================\n \n Europe's '70s Show\n The Continent's economic death spiral.\n \n BY BRIAN M. CARNEY\n Sunday, May 15, 2005 12:01 a.m. EDT\n \n BRUSSELS--Is the European \"social model\" doomed? It's a question that comes up with increasing frequency as unemployment across Western Europe has climbed into the double digits and economic growth has ground to a virtual halt across much of the Continent.\n \n Updated GDP figures for the euro zone came out last week, and growth in the first quarter was a disappointing 0.5%. Last month both the European Commission and the European Central Bank cut their annual growth forecasts for the euro zone to 1.6% from 2%, and that ugly word recession is in the air.\n \n The European Union's much-ballyhooed \"Lisbon Agenda\"--which was supposed to revive growth in Europe--was really not an agenda for reform at all. It was, instead, simply a statement of nice things the EU would like to see happen to the European economy to help it compete with the U.S.--such as raising employment levels, increasing R&D spending, and so on.\n \n Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, almost none of those things have happened, and halfway through the 10-year timetable of \"Lisbon,\" the European economy is in at least as bad a shape as it was when Lisbon was announced in 2000.\n \n Given that Europe's streak of economic underperformance can now be measured in decades, perhaps a better question to ask is: Why does anyone think that a system of generous welfare benefits, high taxes and harsh restrictions on hiring and firing would ever produce anything like a dynamic, growing economy? Why does anyone assume that there is such a thing as a \"European model,\" rather than just a collection of ill-conceived policies having a predictably depressing effect on the economy and job creation?\n \n Of course, Europe did have growth, once. Indeed, for 25 years or so after World War II, European growth was something of an economic miracle, bringing countries like Germany out of hyperinflation and poverty into the first rank of world economies. Along with Germany, Britain, France and Italy rank among the world's biggest economies; and the European Union, considered as a whole, rivals the U.S. for the title of the world's largest economy.\n \n In other words, per the conventional wisdom, Europe had low unemployment and high growth in the past, so it can again. Unfortunately, the argument is wrong. A fundamental change occurred in Europe between the salad days of the 1950s and '60s and today, and Europe never recovered. In a word, the 1970s happened.\n \n In 1965, government spending as a percentage of GDP averaged 28% in Western Europe, just slightly above the U.S. level of 25%. In 2002, U.S. taxes ate 26% of the economy, but in Europe spending had climbed to 42%, a 50% increase. Over the same period, unemployment in Western Europe has risen from less than 3% to 8% today, and to nearly 9% for the 12 countries in the euro zone. These two phenomena are related; in a country with generous welfare benefits, rising unemployment increases government spending rapidly.\n \n But here a third element enters the picture, creating a feedback loop that explains why the Continent will never regain the halcyon days of postwar growth. As spending goes up, higher taxes must follow to pay for those benefits. But those taxes, usually payroll taxes, must be collected from a shrinking number of workers as jobs are cut. This in turn increases the cost of labor and decreases the benefit of working rather than collecting unemployment or welfare checks. As Martin Baily, a former head of Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, has described, this can lead to a spiral of rising taxes and falling employment, especially when welfare payments are high, as they are in most of Western Europe.\n \n The result is predictable--more jobs are lost, the tax base shrinks, and taxes must go up further to pay for yet more welfare benefits, making work less attractive and not working more attractive.\n \n In the 1970s, unemployment went up everywhere in the developed world. But on the Continent, it never went down. Britain and the U.S. both saw major economic reforms in the early 1980s and subsequently recovered from the '70s. The Continent did not, and it's endured the pain of that lost decade ever since. As the nearby chart shows, growth has gone up a little at times, then back down, but unemployment in Continental Europe has remained stuck in a narrow range for three decades.\n \n Western Europe jumped the track and fell into an economic ditch in the 1970s along with the rest of the world. But the Thatcher and Reagan reforms that pushed Britain and the U.S. back onto the rails were never tried on the Continent, and most of those countries have been spinning their wheels ever since.\n \n Rather than ask whether the \"model\" is doomed, it would be better to question how it ever attained the status of a model at all. The welfare state worked in Europe for two decades because so few people needed it; growth was strong, employment high and actual benefits paid were low. When the world economy hit a speed bump following the collapse of the Bretton Woods arrangement in 1971, both government spending and unemployment went up, and the system of incentives and benefits now enshrined as the \"European model\" was tested and found wanting. The result is permanently higher unemployment and taxes, a nasty mix.\n \n In the U.S. and the U.K., a combination of tax cuts, labor-market reforms and deregulation starting in the 1980s broke the downward spiral in which the Continent still finds itself. In the 1990s, the U.S. added welfare reform to the mix. Unfortunately, the prospects for Europe are not particularly bright right now. German unions--and even some members of the German government--have in recent weeks taken to denouncing American capitalists as \"locusts\" and \"bloodsuckers.\" Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, perhaps the only politician in Europe who counts Ronald Reagan as a hero--and admits it--just had his coalition emasculated by special interests at home.\n \n Sadly, it appears as if Europeans will be watching reruns of their own version of \"That '70s Show\" for years to come.\n \n Mr. Carney is editorial page editor of The Wall Street Journal Europe.",

   "This pretty much sums up my feeling about Europe. Going into the tank. Socialism doesn't work. It has never worked and it will never work. \n\n \n Funny that the German wellfare system is a product of their conservative party then ;), France have been ruled by neo-liberals (classical laize fare liberalism) for almost a decade and Italy have elected right-wing neo-fascists to run their country and you try to examplify european socialism by citing the economic history of these three countries :p . Let`s take the whole thing apart and see how it holds up.\n \n \nBRUSSELS--Is the European \"social model\" doomed? It's a question that comes up with increasing frequency as unemployment across Western Europe has climbed into the double digits and economic growth has ground to a virtual halt across much of the Continent.\n\n \n Wrong. French unemployment is estimated to 9,7% in 2004, Germany; 9,5% and Italy 8,0%. the estimated unemployment rate for EU 25 is 9,0% EU 15 is 8,0% and the EURO zone is 8,8%. \n \n The economic growth has hardly come to a \"grinding halt\" on the continent. Only Germany and Italy show lackluster growth figures (which naturally significantly drags down the average due to the size of their economies). The economic growth for EU 25 was 2,4% 2004, EU 15 2,3%, EURO zone 2,1%. \n \n While these are not really impressive figures (compared to the US unemployment of 5,5% and economic growth of 4,4%) there are major differences between various european countries. Eastern European countries have grown rather rapidly while having very large unemployment rates. The scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, Austria and the UK has much lower unemployment figures as well as higher economic growth than the EU average since the turn of the millenia. Spain and especially Ireland has pulled off rather impressive feats of economic \"catching-up\" (Irish economic growth peaked at 11% in 2000 for example). \n \n If one is about to evaluate the economic models in europe, one would do well to analyze european countries specificly. There is no such thing as a homgenous economic model for europe. EU is hardly such an organisation. This is something americans seem to have a hard time understanding.\n \n \nUpdated GDP figures for the euro zone came out last week, and growth in the first quarter was a disappointing 0.5%. Last month both the European Commission and the European Central Bank cut their annual growth forecasts for the euro zone to 1.6% from 2%, and that ugly word recession is in the air.\n\n \n Wait just a minute. At first, the author \"talks\" about western europe. Now he talks about \"the Euro zone\"... That`s a bit fraudulent of him. I`m not surprised though as the forecast for the euro-zone is significantly gloomier than that of EU 25 (or western europe in general)...\n \n \nThe European Union's much-ballyhooed \"Lisbon Agenda\"--which was supposed to revive growth in Europe--was really not an agenda for reform at all. It was, instead, simply a statement of nice things the EU would like to see happen to the European economy to help it compete with the U.S.--such as raising employment levels, increasing R&D spending, and so on.\n \n Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, almost none of those things have happened, and halfway through the 10-year timetable of \"Lisbon,\" the European economy is in at least as bad a shape as it was when Lisbon was announced in 2000.\n\n \n Certain european countries have come farther in realizing the Lisbon treaty goals than others. In general, I don`t think the goals will be met, but by various individual member countries, many goals have allready been met.\n \n As for the european economy being in worse shape than it was the year 2000, I think this is both questionable, and rather interesting that he choose that particular year as a benchmark since it was the best year for many (most) european economies in a decade... The US also had higher growth and lower unempoyment rate in 2000 than you have now...\n \n Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, almost none of those things have happened, and halfway through the 10-year timetable of \"Lisbon,\" the European economy is in at least as bad a shape as it was when Lisbon was announced in 2000.\n \n \n\n Given that Europe's streak of economic underperformance can now be measured in decades, perhaps a better question to ask is: Why does anyone think that a system of generous welfare benefits, high taxes and harsh restrictions on hiring and firing would ever produce anything like a dynamic, growing economy? Why does anyone assume that there is such a thing as a \"European model,\" rather than just a collection of ill-conceived policies having a predictably depressing effect on the economy and job creation?\n\n \n That is true, there is no real \"european model\". The various european countries are far too diferent in their economic systems to be fitted into the same mold. \n \n \n \n \nOf course, Europe did have growth, once. Indeed, for 25 years or so after World War II, European growth was something of an economic miracle, bringing countries like Germany out of hyperinflation and poverty into the first rank of world economies. Along with Germany, Britain, France and Italy rank among the world's biggest economies; and the European Union, considered as a whole, rivals the U.S. for the title of the world's largest economy.\n\n \n LOL... Revisionist history. Europe was catching up to US economic lead up until the 90-ies... \n \n \nIn other words, per the conventional wisdom, Europe had low unemployment and high growth in the past, so it can again. Unfortunately, the argument is wrong. A fundamental change occurred in Europe between the salad days of the 1950s and '60s and today, and Europe never recovered. In a word, the 1970s happened.[B]\n\n \n The seventies was bad from an unemployment perspective. But nineties was worse... This was when the German economy went into recession. This was when the average european economic growth started to lag behind the US. The question is, when will Germany recover from the ninetiees? Because when it does, the European economies will certainly be picking up speed again.\n \n \nWestern Europe jumped the track and fell into an economic ditch in the 1970s along with the rest of the world. But the Thatcher and Reagan reforms that pushed Britain and the U.S. back onto the rails were never tried on the Continent, and most of those countries have been spinning their wheels ever since.\n\n \n They where obviosuly not needed in countries like Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Austria and the Scandinavian countries. In fact, almost each and every one of these countries have higher tax rates, governmental expenditures, labour union affilation etc, etc. And unlike Germany and France some of them have actually been ruled by socialists and social democrats for longer time periods since the 1970ies...\n \n \nIn 1965, government spending as a percentage of GDP averaged 28% in Western Europe, just slightly above the U.S. level of 25%.

In time economic and political realities will most likely force us to somewhere in the middle. \n \n I can tell you the three major ills on American society. 1) Out of control medical care COSTS. 2) Gerrymandering, and 3) special interest money that freezes out the common man.\n \n As I see Europe I see these major problems. 1) A blind refusal to face up to the threat of Islamic fanaticism. 2) A belief that social welfarism is the wave of the future and that these things are somehow \"free.\" 3) A low and lowering productivity that will inevitably cause Europe to fall further behind the U.S. This will lead and will further lead more and more Europeans to resent the U.S. as somehow coming into its wealth illigitimately rather than earning it the old-fashioned way through hard work.",

We see it here in the US all the time: any Canadian healthcare worker with the skill and ambition to compete comes down here to work, and any Canadian patient with enough money to avoid being forgotten to death comes down here for care.\n \n Agreed that the system does not work as well as it could, but that's largely because of government involvement, with lawyers as a secondary cause.",

Have I got that right or you tied to some sort of contract with your Health Insurer ?\n\n \n In my opinion the reason that medical care costs have spiraled out of control is because there are no price constraints in place. Most people have their bills paid by third party insurors. There is very little incentive to save. I do to a doctor's office and pay my co-pay and the rest is charged to the insurance company. The insurance companies pay for the schedule of payments that have been negotiated with the health care providers. \n \n There is also the matter of doctors and their desire to get their foot into a lot of things that run up the costs. A doctor may have in addition to their staffs, they may have their own EKG machines, echo machines, elaborate computer systems, you name it. It is almost like a full care hospital in many cases. Of course they make referrals to specialists who then give second and third opinions and they all take their cut. And let us not forget the ambulance chasing attorneys who are making a killing. \n \n The bottom line is this. We have ready access to medical care and very good care but the costs are out of control. And the cost of medical prescriptions is obscene. Other than that, everything is hunky dory. And the politicians are all on the take. Nothing ever gets done in Congress. The reason it got to this stage was that after WWII, employers started offering medical care as a fringe benefit to lure employees to work for them. At that time the cost was nominal. It was also tax deductible for the employer and therefore a better deal than merely paying the employee more money. This is what has led to this debacle with General Motors. They are down to 170,000 active employees and a million or so retirees all of whom are receiving great medical care at virtually no cost. They are in fact the largest medical care purchaser in the U.S. that just happens to manufacture cars and trucks on the side.",

   "============================\n I'll give you this. You ask a lot of questions. \n\n \n Yeah, I guess that`s the way I like to discuss things. I find it creating a more open and dynamic discussion :)\n \n \n Germany's unemployment rate hit 12.7% last month, and France's unemployment rate remained at 10.1%\n\n \n These kind of things should not be measured in this way if you want to have comparable and reliable figures (unemployment should for example be seasonally adjusted and german unemployment figures have recently been boosted by a re-classification of the term). That is why I refer to the average unemployment for 2004. We are not investors, so we do not need to analyse indicators as \"snap-shots\". \n \n \n From the NY Sun. Our unemployment right now is 5.2%. Most economists view 4-4.5% unemployment as actually \"full employment\" in that a number of these folks are between jobs and/or just waiting out their unemployment checks.\n\n \n You mean structural unemployment? That seems about right. We have estimated roughly the same figure for Sweden. It`s kind of dramatic though, considering our structural unemployment was around 1-2% in the 80-ies.\n \n I don`t really know what the equivalent figure would be for Germany though, but I don`t think it`s very far from 5%...\n \n \n\n Let's be honest about this discussion. You are living in a welfare state that is a democracy. I am living in a semi-welfare state that is a democracy. In time economic and political realities will most likely force us to somewhere in the middle.\n\n \n Probably. But the opposite could also happen where the US and various european countries move farther away from \"the middle\". It all boils down to what \"works\" in the eyes of the voter. I think the european countries will converge in regards of our economic systems. I also think that neo-liberalism has lost it`s momentum in europe and socialism will be on the rise again.\n \n \n \n I can tell you the three major ills on American society. 1) Out of control medical care COSTS. 2) Gerrymandering, and 3) special interest money that freezes out the common man.\n\n \n These are all over-comeable. I would suggest penalizing certain lifestyles, focus on nutrition and exercise in public and private schools and encourage activities and lifestyle choices that acts preventive to health problems. A little social engineering would go a long way I think.\n \n Can`t gerrymandering be legislated away? I mean, it can`t be in both parties interests to allow these kind of things.\n \n Special interests will always be a problem in a democracy. Perhaps more transparancy in these kinds of processes would discourage at least shady deals?\n \n \n As I see Europe I see these major problems. 1) A blind refusal to face up to the threat of Islamic fanaticism. 2) A belief that social welfarism is the wave of the future and that these things are somehow \"free.\" 3) A low and lowering productivity that will inevitably cause Europe to fall further behind the U.S. This will lead and will further lead more and more Europeans to resent the U.S. as somehow coming into its wealth illigitimately rather than earning it the old-fashioned way through hard work.\n\n \n \n Islamic fanatism is not a threat IMO. It si a problem, that must be dealt with. But I guess we`ve talked about this before ;)\n \n social wellfarism certainly has costs and is hard to implement efficiently. But when it is, there are also substantial rewards in both economic and social terms.\n \n Productivity is not declining in Europe. It is certainly growing. But in the last decade, US productivity has increased faster than the average European productivity. That being said, various individual european countries have had faster productivity growth than the US as well...",

In the event you don't know the origin of the name a politician by the name of Elbridge Gerry originated it. This is the story.\n \n \"The term is named after early Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry. In 1812, the Massachusetts legislature redrew legislative district lines to favor the Jeffersonian Republican party candidates. Two reporters were looking at the new election map and one commented that one of the new districts looked just like a salamander. The other retorted that it looked like a Gerry-mander. The name stuck and is now used by political scientists everywhere.\"\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymander#Origins_of_the_term\n \n To answer your question, the only way I can see it going away is through a constitutional amendment. It has even been held up by the highest courts as constitutional. Both parties use it and it effectively made our House of Representatives a defacto \"House of Lords\" although the very opposite was intended by our founders who wanted the representatives to be elected every two years and be more responsive to the citizens than the senators who at that time were appointed by the states/governors. It is not possible to gerrymander an entire state so the senators who are elected every six years have a much tougher time of it. But on any given election of the 435 members of the House, only 15 or 20 are truly competitive elections. The rest are guaranteed \"reelection.\" Many don't even have opponents or only token opponents. It's a truly sorry mess and a national scandal.",
