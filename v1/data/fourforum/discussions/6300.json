   "From foetus to full term - without a mother's touch\n By Ainsley Newson \n \n ARTIFICIAL wombs, to bring a foetus of a human being to full term outside a woman's body, could become a reality within 20 years, scientists have predicted. \n \n This could present great advantages in the case of very premature babies, which could be nurtured to full pregnancy term in artificial wombs, thereby reducing the risk of long-term developmental problems. \n \n Such technology might also appeal to those who cannot have children naturally, such as women with a damaged uterus or no uterus at all, or to gay couples. The need for surrogate mothers could disappear. \n \n Experiments with human embryos, mice and goats have already had some success. But the technology raises significant ethical challenges and should not proceed without full ethical debate, Frida Simonstein, of Ben Gurion University in Israel, said. \n \n She told a weekend conference in Barcelona on ethics and emerging medical technologies that these problems were not insurmountable. \n \n \"Society now expects better outcomes for premature babies. Society also demands improvement in IVF effectiveness. Yet society should be equally aware that these demands require research that leads to the development of an artificial womb. \n \n \"We must start discussing this topic now while we have still enough time to decide what we may want, and why.\" \n \n In 2002 Hung-Ching Liu, at Cornell University, in the United States, announced that her team had successfully grown a sample of cells from the lining of a human uterus and had used tissue engineering technologies to shape them like a womb. \n \n When a fertilised human egg was introduced into the womb, it implanted into the uterus wall as it would in a natural pregnancy. The experiment was ceased at six days' gestation, because of legal limits on human embryo experimentation. \n \n Japanese scientists brought goat foetuses to full term using so-called \"uterine tanks\" after removing them mid-pregancy from their mother's womb. \n \n In further womb research by Dr Liu's team, mouse embryos were grown nearly to term in artificial wombs but, as in the Japanese experiments, the newborn animals did not survive. \n \n Artificial wombs are not yet safe for human pregnancies. But if, as expected, the technology can one day be applied in human beings, scientific advantages may result. \n \n But Richard Ashcroft, reader in medical ethics at Imperial College London, fears a \"foetal rescue act\" to force drug or alcohol-addicted mothers to have their foetuses surgically removed. \"I couldn't think of anything worse,\" he said. \n \n It is also feared that scientists involved in cloning could continue their experiments without the need for surrogate mothers. \n \n There is a danger too that some women who want babies but cannot face pregnancy or childbirth could take advantage of the artificial wombs - one step beyond being \"too posh to push\". If they see their babies growing in a tank, would they bond with their newborns, or view them as commodities? Dr Ashcroft said: \"Is creating children with artificial wombs having children at all, or is it a kind of manufacturing of children? It is deeply dangerous.\" \n \n The issue will add fresh fuel to the abortion debate.\n \n \n Copyright 2005 Times Newspapers Ltd.\n This service is provided on Times Newspapers' standard Terms and Conditions .

No over population, no unemployment, no crime and we would all be happy for it.\n \n Opinions?",

   "The previously two links and the whole subject of genetic engineering are in my view the most important issue in the world today. The hurricanes, terrorism, the starving in Africa are all minor points in comparison. \n \n Assuming an absence of a god and that the theory of evolution is probably correct. Then human success comes down to the fact that we can adapt the environment to suit our needs, which are reproduction and the continuation of the species. We have now or soon will reach a stage where we can adapt ourselves to fit the society we have created. We will become master of evolution. If there is a god we having taken steps to challenging it, for we can improve what it created.\n \n Therefore we must discuss the society we want. People strive for equality, peace, justice and many other ideals of happiness thou not all achieve these and these ideals in fact have no intrinsic value for they are not vital to life, they are simply just a way of trying to help us get along.\n \n There are as many different ideals of utopia as there are people but no one is any more right then the other. All that matters is that people accept their place. \n \n The world cannot cope with 6 billion people living a western life style. People can not cope with 6 billion others. The differences in beliefs and the competition for resources will always end in wars, political, economically or military. All of which cause misery.\n \n So let us chose the world we want and peruse it.\n \n And if you do disagree like I hope you do or if you feel this issue isn't important please say why.",

   "Personally, this like all other technology is just going to make everyone's life worse. I'll quote from the best description I've read of this (in regards to the car) --\n \n \nA technological advance that appears not to threaten freedom often turns out to threaten it very seriously later on. For example, consider motorized transport. A walking man formerly could go where he pleased, go at his own pace without observing any traffic regulations, and was independent of technological support-systems. When motor vehicles were introduced they appeared to increase man's freedom. They took no freedom away from the walking man, no one had to have an automobile if he didn't want one, and anyone who did choose to buy an automobile could travel much faster than the walking man. But the introduction of motorized transport soon changed society in such a way as to restrict greatly man's freedom of locomotion. When automobiles became numerous, it became necessary to regulate their use extensively. In a car, especially in densely populated areas, one cannot just go where one likes at one's own pace one's movement is governed by the flow of traffic and by various traffic laws. One is tied down by various obligations: license requirements, driver test, renewing registration, insurance, maintenance required for safety, monthly payments on purchase price. Moreover, the use of motorized transport is no longer optional. Since the introduction of motorized transport the arrangement of our cities has changed in such a way that the majority of people no longer live within walking distance of their place of employment, shopping areas and recreational opportunities, so that they HAVE TO depend on the automobile for transportation. Or else they must use public transportation, in which case they have even less control over their own movement than when driving a car. Even the walker's freedom is now greatly restricted. In the city he continually has to stop and wait for traffic lights that are designed mainly to serve auto traffic. In the country, motor traffic makes it dangerous and unpleasant to walk along the highway. (Note the important point we have illustrated with the case of motorized transport: When a new item of technology is introduced as an option that an individual can accept or not as he chooses, it does not necessarily REMAIN optional. In many cases the new technology changes society in such a way that people eventually find themselves FORCED to use it.)\n\n \n \n Lets take employment -- sure a woman (in the future) *could* have a natural conception and birth but the company she works for might not give her paid maternity leave rather instead they say they are willing to pay for an 'artificial womb' and 'artificial birth'.\n \n Indeed, even more subtle is that the woman may feel socially pressured in the work environment because other women more career minded will pay for artificial wombs so they might 'get ahead' and be seen to be 'team players' (I hate that phrase).\n \n Eventually, while the option for natural birth still exists really the option has become an illusion, much like the car example above.\n \n Anyway I think you get the point...",

   "You've got to be kidding me. How is not optional to own a car? My grandmother has never owned a car, and hasn't driven in over 50 years.\n \n How is waiting at a crosswalk a violation of one's freedom? Don't you think people had to watch out for horses back in the day?\n \n The obligations of car ownership don't effect you if you don't own a car.\n \n Cities are more spread out than pre-automoblies, but no one is forced to own a car. The real issues is that people today are lazy. I've actually seen someone drive to their mailbox (less than 50 yards), and no, he wasn't old or injured, etc. \n \n I work 15 miles away from home, and have to climb 1000 vertical feet both ways but I ride my bicycle to work and back every Sunday. I also don't agree with it being dangerous on the highway. 99% of drivers go out of their way to stay clear. I probably put more miles on my bike each month than most people have in their life. \n \n Could it happen with artificial wombs? sure, and I'm sure it would eventually become popular, but nothing would stop a natural gestation besides people's tendancy to be lazy.",
