   "Not Muslim? I suggest you research the Saud Family. They declare Saudi Arabia as one of the most pure of Islamic nations, and the clerics there have a great amount of control over civil government. Bin Laden's beef with them is their loyalty to the US, who supports Israel with money and materials. A majority of the 9/11 terrorists were Saudis, as is Bin Laden. There are those who believe the Sauds look the other way when it comes to Bin Laden and continue to financially support his network. A majority of the killings in Saudi Arabia have been of Americans.\n\n \n \n I did research the Saud Family, I guess I should have been more descriptive. The Suadi Family is Muslim, however, they are not practicing Muslims. The Saud Family represents everything that muslims are not supposed to do. True Muslims, do not beleive in spending money and living a lavish life style as the Saud Family does. Make no mistake Bin Ladens beef is with the Saud Family not being \"true\" muslims. And sure the Sauds look the other way, why would they want to fight Osama, they dont have the power to. Osama would wipe them out. That is one reason America has to step in. Plus the reinging Saud family really does not care about their land or what happens on it, they just want to become richer,and what ever makes them richer, they go along with.",

   "Asleep at the wheel\n\n Jim's response to my assertion that moore's movie was not anti-gun as the web site author suggested\n \n \ncome on, respond to this one\n \n http://www.davekopel.com/Terror/Fiftysix-Deceits-in-Fahrenheit-911.htm\n\n of the 59 deceits cited in this essay, the most detrimental falsity moore shows is that the taliban delegation was welcomed by the bush administration. this was a key part of the movie, but kopel's research shows this to be false. the other \"deceits\" were fairly minor when compared to the overall movie, and many of them were only deceits in the perspective of the writer, as many were too technicalor trivial to be really seen as discrediting the overall message of the movie. (but hey, thats my opinion)\n \n another big jolt is where moore left off the major countries in the \"coalition of the willing\". to me this was funny, seeing that i never even heard of the republic of palau! lol, anyway, i too was like so where's spain and UK? this is a misleading depiction of the coalition many countries including the phillipines and even korea are contributing to the war alliance\n \n anyway, as comprehensive as this article may be, there are an enormous number of claims that moore's movie makes that have not been shown as false by kopel's essay, and these points, in my opinion, play a much larger role in supporting moore's case.\n \n first of all, i think the message i got from watching the movie is that (1) the bush family has a lot of financial gain coming from an iraqi conflict (2) the saudis had many more links to al qaeda than did iraq (the iraqi-al qaeda connections are still very vague and abstract even to today) (3) the invasion of afghanistan was more about allowing the construction of the pipeline than finding bin laden (4) the invasion of iraqi was more about securing the oil reserves than eliminating terrorism.\n \n the main claims in the movie that supports moore's view (that havent yet been rebutted)\n \n - thousands of florida constituents that were estimated to vote democratic (felons) were removed from the voting list.\n - the chair person of the bush campaigne was also the lady in charge of the florida vote count\n - george bush's cousin (or brother, cant remember) is the governor of florida\n - all of the objections to the vote count were disqualified because no senators were available to sign the objections\n - bush's inauguration was poorly recieved in washington dc\n - bush's ratings were declining steadily before 9/11\n - 2 days after 9/11, while flights were restricted only to the highest priorties only, about 30 planes transporting 24 members of the bin laden family were ok'd to depart to saudi arabia. this was at a time when even domestic flights were under very tight restrictions, much more for international flights, and the ban was only lifted for highest security purposes (to me this is major)\n - james bath, the accountant for the bin laden family, was a major financial contributor to bush's failing arbisto oil company\n - bush and prince bandar had very close business and personal ties\n - the carlyle group, a congomerate that bush sr chairs on, is supported financially by the bin ladens. therefore any profit that the carlyle group makes will greatly benefit the bin ladens. since the 9/11 attacks the carlyle group's profits have been soaring (this is major)\n - 12 of the 19 hijackers involved in the 9/11 attacks were saudi arabians\n - bin laden's family and a part of the al qaeda network is in saudi arabia\n - after the afghanistan attacks, the person put in political power was one of the unocal advisors. shortly after being put in power he approves the construction of the pipeline (this is also major)\n - after finding no evidence of WMDs in iraq, nor evidence linking saddam to bin laden, america still proceeds to bomb bagdhad and invade iraq\n - kopel's rebuttal to the claim that the iraq/al qaeda connection was fabricated actually supports moore rather than discredits him (* i'll elaborate on this below)\n - oil entrepreneurs are already assessing the iraqi oil fields\n \n ok, i'll stop for now. these claims made by moore's movie all lead to the conclusions i stated in my 4th paragraph. \n \n let's look at kopel's deceit 44 (about how condoleezza rice links iraqi to the attacks)\n \n \nOh, indeed there is a tie between Iraq and what happened on 9/11. It's not that Saddam Hussein was somehow himself and his regime involved in 9/11, but, if you think about what caused 9/11, it is the rise of ideologies of hatred that lead people to drive airplanes into buildings in New York. This is a great terrorist, international terrorist network that is determined to defeat freedom. It has perverted Islam from a peaceful religion into one in which they call on it for violence. And they're all linked. And Iraq is a central front because, if and when, and we will, we change the nature of Iraq to a place that is peaceful and democratic and prosperous in the heart of the Middle East, you will begin to change the Middle East....\n\n by citing the \"rise of ideologies\" (dictatorship and tyranny, i assume), iraq is responsible for the 9/11 attacks. to me this is just a desperate act of clutching at straws. iraq did not pioneer or initiate anti-american hate, and terrorism, as well as al qaeda itself, was in existence long before saddam's dictatorship. in the light of the full speech, rice's connection of al qaeda and iraq becomes more laughable",

   "ok moose, the article you linked to adresses points that kopel also addressed, but ill deal with them in more detail\n \n first, the article counters the 1.4 billion payout moore talks about. the article is correct in stating that bush sr himself was not on the carlyle board when BDM was generating that money. however, moore's narrative says that this 1.4 billion was paid to bush's dad and his friends over several years, so the claim is true, even though its not that bush sr himself was paid 1.4 billion. however, the financial relations with the saudis and carlyle after bush sr joined the board has afforded him a salary higher than what he made being a president\n \n second, the taliban/bush relationship. i already conceded that this is a deception, and that all evidence shows that bush wasnt \"friendly\" with the taliban as moore seems to suggest\n \n third, james bath did invest into bush's arbusto venture, and james bath also happened to be the financial advisor for the bin laden family at the time. i'll leave people to draw their own conclusion from this\n \n fourth, the saudi's were flown out of the country at what was apparently the earliest opportunity possible. the article tries to defend this by saying they were being protected from possible vigilante attacks. on 9/13 it wasnt even made public that bin laden was responsible, so the public couldnt possibly have been planning to attack saudis. the only people that saw the sept 11 / saudi attack connection would have been the fbi (who approved the flights). this means that they knew possibly as early as 9/11 itself that bin laden was behind the tragedy. besides, there were numerous other arabians and middle-east people in america who were victims of vigilante attacks that the fbi were not as interested in protecting.\n \n i almost missed the point about the pipeline. as pointed out before, the taliban and bush administration apparently werent buddies. very likely the unsuccessful negotiations to build the pipeline through afghanistan while the taliban was in power would have been a side-effect of this. however, no later had the americans ousted the taliban, they appointed a new head of state which also happened to be a unocal board advisor. he promptly approved the pipeline construction. this was one of the points that supports moore's case in a big way\n \n there is another point that comes to mind that moore did not even mention. by december 2003 there were more than 11 times more troops in iraq than in afghanistan, meaning that the effort to capture saddam, who at that time still was found with no wmds or links to bin laden,was 11 times greater than the effort to capture bin laden himself, whom the fbi knew from the start was responsible for the deaths of the wtc occupants\n \n anyway moose, your article doesnt refute any of the points i listed that supports moore's view\n \n i should have mentioned before, but i'll say now. i dont agree with moore's strong pro-democratic/anti-republican underlying message at all, and had bush been a democrat, the effect of the message would have been the same. i am not partial to either political party, in fact, i would prefer bush win this election than kerry. but at the same time i think moore brings some very valid points that should be considered, especially since the punchline of the movie was the senseless sacrifice of thousands of soldiers whose lives and the lives of their family will never bee the same. for those that discount the movie based on moore's democratic affiliation, i say shame on you.",

Bush might have had them as guests to ask them what it would take to allow the pipeline to happen. Something tells me that the Taliban wanted too much or Unocal/Bush wanted to give too little.\n \n http://www.truthout.org/docs_02/12.30A.afgh.pipe.htm\n \n this: http://moorewatch.com/index.php/weblog/taliban_pipe_dream/\n \n says that Bush had nothing to do with th Taliban. Did they not see the part in the movie where Bush is shown ecsorting Taliban members around?\n \n http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/MAD201A.htm\n \n So anyway, whether we can blame Unocal for wanting to build the pipeline or the government for wanting to build it is another topic. Personally, I don't think you can blame anyone for wanting to build a pipeline through lovely Afghanistan. But, it really does look like that was the root of everything 9/11, no matter how you look at it. \n \n \ni almost missed the point about the pipeline. as pointed out before, the taliban and bush administration apparently werent buddies. very likely the unsuccessful negotiations to build the pipeline through afghanistan while the taliban was in power would have been a side-effect of this. however, no later had the americans ousted the taliban, they appointed a new head of state which also happened to be a unocal board advisor. he promptly approved the pipeline construction. this was one of the points that supports moore's case in a big way\n \n\n \n Exactly.",

But we stand by our account that Unger's claims about the Saudi flights, as portrayed in \"Fahrenheit 9/11,\" are contradicted by the findings of the 9-11 Commission. The commission's interim report states that of the Saudis interviewed by the FBI, \"many were asked detailed questions.\" The commission wrote that the FBI took other steps to screen the departing Saudis&#8212;including running their names through federal databases&#8212;and that \"nobody of interest to the FBI with regard to the 9-11 investigation was allowed to leave the country.\" On the questioning of timing, the commission states that the flights taking Saudis out of the country began on Sept. 14. The Tampa flight in question was a domestic flight to Lexington, Ky., that took off late on Sept. 13 after restrictions on flying had already been lifted and Tampa International Airport had reopened for business.\n \n *****************************************\n Libel Suit 9/11\n Michael Moore's hysterical, empty threats.\n By Jack Shafer\n \n \n Moore bark than bite\n \n \"Any attempts to libel me will be met by force,'\" Fahrenheit 9/11 director Michael Moore told the New York Times on Sunday (June 20, 2004). \"The most important thing we have is truth on our side. If they persist in telling lies, knowingly telling a lie with malice, then I'll take them to court.\"\n \n The Times also reported that Moore \"has consulted with lawyers who can bring defamation suits against anyone who maligns the film or damages his reputation,\" and that he's established a \"war room\" to monitor attacks on the film. Lest anybody miss his threat, the filmmaker repeated it the same day on This Week With George Stephanopoulos and in the pages of the San Francisco Chronicle, and will probably whistle the same libel tune all week long in publicity interviews for the film, which opens Friday. \n \n The first peculiar thing about Moore's libel-mongering is that most American journalists disdain libel suits as a matter of principle. Even when they have good cause for a suit, most journalists refrain from filing, believing that libel threats keep topics of controversy from being aired. They'd rather contest hostile attacks on their work in the marketplace of ideas, not courtrooms. Why Moore, the former editor of the Michigan Voice and a regular purveyor of controversial journalism, has chosen to break with this tradition is anybody's guess. (One irony too good to pass up: Stringent libel laws, the sort that Moore appears to be advocating this week, have essentially blocked the publication of journalist Craig Unger's book House of Bush, House of Saud in the United Kingdom. Noteworthy only because Unger and his book are important Fahrenheit 9/11 sources.)\n \n \n Be that as it may, if Moore wants to sue anyone who maligns his film, he certainly has a legal right to do so. But will he get very far? \n \n Not likely.\n \n Defamation (written libel) occurs when somebody publishes as fact something that is false, is \"unprivileged,\" and harms somebody's reputation by making him the object of hatred or ridicule, causes him to be shunned, or injures him financially or professionally. So unless Moore's critics call him a liar, a felon, a murderer, a chiseler, a Nazi, a child molester, tax evader or any other false statement that is objectively provable, they'll likely not receive a court summons from his lawyers. (See this libel refresher on Findlaw.) \n \n Likewise, no court would be inclined to find in Moore's favor if a critic accused him of lying once or twice or 12 times in Fahrenheit 9/11, or accused him of bending facts to his convenience, or damned him for being disingenuous. This sort of subjective expression of opinion is protected under the law, and there's nothing the blustering Moore can do to stop his critics from making them. Given the thousands of wildly hostile film, book, and restaurant reviews published each year, court dockets would be overflowing with libel suits if bringing one was as easy as Moore pretends to think it is.\n \n I write \"pretend\" because Moore understands, from first-hand experience, the protections enjoyed by opinion journalists. On This Week, Moore described Fahrenheit 9/11 as \"an op-ed piece. It's my opinion about the last four years of the Bush administration. And that's what I call it. I'm not trying to pretend that this is some sort of, you know, fair and balanced work of journalism. &#8230;\" Later in the interview, he called the movie \"a comedy, too.\" In other words, he knows that nobody is likely to get very far by suing him for his opinions, as expressed in Fahrenheit 9/11. Since he clearly understands the law, it's plain that if we take Moore at his word, he appears to believe in free speech only for himself.\n \n On the outside chance that a court decided that a critic published as fact something that is false and caused people to despise Moore, he would still have to prove in a court of law that the statement injured him financially or professionally. Seeing as Fahrenheit 9/11 is sure to do better box office than every previous Moore film, increase his leverage in the movie and book industries, and secure for him the Insignia of Commander in the Order of Arts and Letters, how will he ever prove damages?\n \n Of course, multimillionaire Moore can always punish his critics financially by filing silly lawsuits that require them to spend huge sums to be dismissed as frivolous. But Moore is not likely to want that sort of publicity and heartache&#8212;it's as much a drag to sue as it is to be sued. And a man with his sort of assets isn't likely to tempt a countersuit by the defendant when the case is tossed out. Moore isn't likely to find a more severe appraisal of his film and his work than this Slate piece by Christopher Hitchens. Read it, Mr. Moore. We invite your suit.\n \n http://slate.msn.com/id/2102723/",

Dozens of travelers stranded, among them, Ricky Martin, due to perform at tonight's Latin Grammy awards. \n \n NARRATOR: Not even Ricky Martin would fly. But really, who wanted to fly? No one. Except the bin Ladens.\n \n (video of plane taking off... song, \"We've got to get out of this place\")\n \n SEN. BYRON DORGAN: We had some airplanes authorized at the highest levels of our government to fly to pick up Osama bin Laden's family members and others from Saudi Arabia; transport them out of this country.\n \n NARRATOR: It turns out that the White House approved planes to pick up the bin Ladens and numerous other Saudis. At least six private jets and nearly two dozen commercial plans carried the Saudis and the bin Ladens out of the U.S. after September 13th. In all, 142 Saudis, including 24 members of the bin Laden family, were allowed to leave the country.\n\n moore's film shows that the saudis were flying after the 13th. all evidence shows that on the 13th the ban on flights was lifted. see for yourself, moore never said that the flights were made before the restrictions were lifted. and rev, if you didnt see the movie, at least read the transcript (and save $9), that way your responses would sound more substantial",

   "1. The Passion told a story from a book. -NO CONTROVERSY (Cept the media made one up)\n \n 2. Farenheit 7/11 is a fantasy story based on lies and editing sold as a documentary. - CONTROVERSY\n\n \n What book does The Passion get its story from? Not the bible. All that dialogue in the movie was not in the Bible. Passion Plays were started in the Middle Ages and didn't really stick to the Bible so much.\n \n http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/Kriel-Deconstructing_Passion_of_the_Christ-1.htm\n \nThe genre?\n \n In order to assess the film, it is essential to decide on its genre. It presents itself as, and Church leaders claim that it is, a historically accurate and truthful retelling of the gospel story. Is it therefore a documentary? According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, a documentary is \"a motion picture that shapes and interprets factual material for purposes of education or entertainment.\" Because a documentary \"shapes and interprets\" factual material, it can of course also be used for ideological and propaganda purposes. \n \n But, in spite of its veneer of factuality, this film is not a documentary. There is no attempt to present, shape, and interpret factual events. There is no discussion, no development of insight or of differing perspectives - there is only the presentation of a series of pre-interpreted events. Chilton believes that this picture promotes the interpretation of Jesus of the Roman Catholic Counter Reformation (to which both Gibson and his father subscribe). They are essentially opposed to the changes brought about in the Roman Catholic Church by the Second Vatican Council.\n \n So is it a cinematic reconstruction of historical events - a historical drama such as his previous films Braveheart and The Patriot? Such a genre is the historical novel of the cinema. It allows, within limits, for invention, imagination, and interpretation. This is probably the genre which best describes The Passion. Chilton suggests that it is an example of a subgenre of the historical drama, namely a passion play. This is a very ancient form of drama in which the death (and resurrection) of a god or martyrdom (and vindication) of a holy person is re-enacted. \n \n http://www.umc.org/interior_print.asp?mid=3314\n \n Yeah, absolutely no controversy! emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \n .",

   "The controversy of the Passion was not centered on truthfulness but on whether it was anti-semitic. I saw it and concluded that it was not (as did several of my Jewish friends). It was biblically correct and appeared not to be distorted by trickery. (This is not to argue the validity of the Bible, but to say that Gibson presented the story as closely as he could to what is presented in the Bible.)\n \n The controversy of Farenheit is centered around Moore's lying and misrepresentations of the truth. When his own people agree that he lied and misrepresented the truth, I have no need to see it to believe that he did just that...and I certainly have no desire to line that bastard's pockets with my gold.\n\n \n \n http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/Kriel-Deconstructing_Passion_of_the_Christ-1.htm\n \n \nSo is it a cinematic reconstruction  of historical events - a historical drama such as his previous films Braveheart and The Patriot?

This is probably the genre which best describes The Passion. \n \n \n \n\"The mood The Passion generates is meditative and contemplative. The tone is awe.\"1 Bruce Chilton, Professor of Religion at Bard College, considers it a \"libellous farce, poor art, and an incentive for credulous viewers to confuse Christian faith with hatred.\"2 Public reaction varied from nationwide emotionalism in the USA to indifference in the UK. \n \n \n \n \n These people think The Passion is controversial because of its lack of truthfullness. But, as they say, its a drama. Dramas don't have to tell the truth.\n \n Maybe they think if a 1st century christian time travelled to now, he'd be upset at the \"lies\" and inaccuracies portrayed in The Passion.\n \n Anyway, what apathy was saying is that the movie theater had a double standard because the owner said he wouldn't show F9/11 because it was controversial. But, the Passion was also controversial. The owner didn't modify or qualify with the reasons. It's a double standard.",

As of 08 November 2001 it was reported that a total of 400 American aircraft were deployed, including reconnaissance, transport and tanker aircraft. However, this number also included the aircraft patrolling the southern and northern \"no fly\" zones over Iraq. The total number of aircraft involved in the war by early November 2001 was nearly 500, including reconnaissance and other support aircraft from Britain, Canada, Australia and France. KC-10 and KC-135 tankers were primarily concentrated in several orbits over south-western Pakistan, flying from bases in Diego Garcia, Oman, Bahrain, and elsewhere in Southwest Asia. Approximately 14,000 Air Force personnel were committed to the war in Afghanistan.\n\n \n And, \nAs of early March 2002 more than 17,000 coalition military personnel from 17 countries have deployed in the region since October 2001. A smaller number of these are actually operating in Afghanistan.\n\n \n In June 2004, we find that, \nU.S. military forces in Afghanistan now number 17,900 and are likely to remain at that level at least through the New Year, according to senior Pentagon leaders. \n \n Lt. Gen. Norton A. Schwartz, the Joint Staff's Director of Operations, gave the size of the current U.S. presence in Afghanistan during testimony Wednesday before the House Armed Services Committee. \n \n His revelation that there are close to 18,000 U.S. troops involved in Operation Enduring Freedom appeared to surprise some members of the committee - including Rep. John Spratt, a Democrat from South Carolina - who had presumed a considerably smaller presence.\n\n \n \n \n We have a large number of men and women in Afghanistan, around 18,000 right now. We also have Pakistan monitoring their border area with Afghanistan. I'm assuming Bin Laden has probably left Afghanistan, so now it's even harder to find him. He could be in Iran, Syria, or in my backyard. We can't throw 18,000 troops in every country until we find him. We are going to have to use serveillance and the help of locals who can tell us where he may be. With a multi-million dollar bounty on his head, someone is eventually going to turn him or some information on him over to us. \n \n You can't really judge anything from the videos. They could have put up a poster and a podium in the middle of the desert and made it look like they were in a city. Remember, these people aren't XXXXXX. I doubt he is in Afghanistan, but who knows. We thought there would be no way Saddam would remain in Iraq, but that's where we found him. \n \n I suggest you tell a friend to dress up in New York City and let him go for a day. You'd have lots of trouble even trying to find him there. Imagine looking for him throughout the Middle East? That's about how hard it will be to find Bin Laden. He moves from place to place, rarely staying more than a day in 1 place. His henchmen who travel with him are the most loyal of friends and are not going to divulge any information on him. Some governments probably cooperate with him and offer shelter for him (Saddam did). \n \n As long as Bin Laden is on the run, he can't put forth much of an effort against us. My guess is that before this time next year we will have found him. But that's just my humble opinion.",

But that's just my humble opinion.\n\n what makes you think bin laden is on the run? like i said, who's chasing him? and who's looking for him?",

   "i agree that the videos dont say much (except that the lighting was artificial, so he was indoors). as for saddam, we gave him less than a week's warning, then attacked. with bin laden, he had over a month. assuming that bin laden would remain in afghanistan and not go to one of the dozen or so countries that he probably knew america wouldnt touch, would be poor judgement imo\n\n \n We gave Saddam 10+ years. He had been violating 18 or so resolutions. The UN authored a bill months before we invaded threatening the use of force if he didn't comply. He had well over a month's notice.\n \n \n \nwhat makes you think bin laden is on the run? like i said, who's chasing him? and who's looking for him? \n\n \n I'm sure, and according to many intelligence reports, he is moving day by day. Muslims out there turn over other terrorists all the time. Why would they turn over the big boy for $25 mil?",

   "We gave Saddam 10+ years. He had been violating 18 or so resolutions. The UN authored a bill months before we invaded threatening the use of force if he didn't comply. He had well over a month's notice.\n\n \n Yes, and it turns out that he DID comply, 10+ years ago. He also complied immediatly following the new resolution, releasing every document the UN requested as well as some that they didn't but probably should have. THEN, he promised and gave access to anything the inspectors wanted to look at. We still invaded Iraq, killed a bunch of civilians, and oveerthrew the government. no wonder all these other nations are scramling to get nuclear weapons. If I was the leader of a country that was not chummy with the US (which means either not sitting on top of a big enough oil reserve to impress us, or don't have a huge lobby in this country to ensure that we allow violations of international laws to occur and still send billion per year) I would certianly be trying to develop nukes, too.\n \n \n \nI'm sure, and according to many intelligence reports, he is moving day by day. Muslims out there turn over other terrorists all the time. Why would they turn over the big boy for $25 mil?\n\n \n Because BL is to fundamentalist Muslims what the pope is to fundamentalist catholics. People build SHRINES to the man in their homes. Couple this witht he fact that the majority of the world views America is a far less than favorable light and it should be apparent to even the most stringent neconservative that not everybody is for sale, even of every neocon is.",

He had well over a month's notice.\n\n saddam did comply with the un resolutions, as daewoo said. and even if he didnt, how could that still sepercede the urgency of bringing bin laden to justice? regardless of how many charges you bring against saddam (even the ones that turned out to be false), please explain how anything we could possibly accuse saddam of could be more serious or important than hunting down bin laden\n \n you have to remember, its not like we are tracking bin laden down, and rounding up these secondary players as well. we COMPLETELY abandoned the hunt for bin laden, and saddam is the ONLY \"terrorist supporter\" we have targeted for elimination. how can that be justified?\n \n \nI'm sure, and according to many intelligence reports, he is moving day by day. Muslims out there turn over other terrorists all the time. Why would they turn over the big boy for $25 mil?\n\n would you mind linking some of those reports? and even if bin laden is \"moving day by day\", it still doesnt support the idea that he is on the run, or that anyone is chasing him. in fact, his \"movements\" could very well be tending to al qaeda business unimpeded",
