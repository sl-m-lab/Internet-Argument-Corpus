If this is a veiled swipe at those who oppose social programs, then she's on the wrong track--there's no Biblical mandates for the U.S. govt.--it's about individuals. And why would people who preach separation of church and state like it's the golden rule want a nation to follow Christian ideals anyway???? \n \n Another problem is that there ARE many, many individuals that are doing a great deal of compassionate work in the wake of the hurricane (and many do so normally anyway). Christian individuals. And even (GASP) Christian conservatives. Evangelicals. (WHOA, NELLY!!) Imagine that--people who have a moral stand on homosexual behavior actually aren't the green-eyed monsters the left sometimes makes them out to be. Maybe even good folks.

That is their prerogative, but when they drape themselves in the mantle of Christianity, real Christians must speak out and speak out loudly.\n\n I know that too.
