Here is an overview of the federal licensing scheme&#8230;. \n \n The criminal statutes dealing with FFL licensing requirements are clipped here:\n \n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 Unlawful Acts:\n \n It shall be unlawful -\n \n (1) for any person -\n \n (A) except a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer, to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms, or in the course of such business to ship, transport, or receive any firearm in interstate or foreign commerce.(bold emphasis added)\n \n \n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923 - Licensing\n \n (a) No person shall engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms, or importing or manufacturing ammunition, until he has filed an application with and received a license to do so from the Attorney General. \n \n These two criminal statutes are governed by definitions found in another statute, the relevant portions of which are clipped here:\n \n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 definitions: \n \n (11) The term \"dealer\" means\n \n (A) any person engaged in the business of selling firearms at wholesale or retail,\n \n (B) any person engaged in the business of repairing firearms or of making or fitting special barrels, stocks, or trigger mechanisms to firearms, or\n \n (C) any person who is a pawnbroker. The term \"licensed dealer\" means any dealer who is licensed under the provisions of this chapter.\n \n (12) The term \"pawnbroker\" means any person whose business or occupation includes the taking or receiving, by way of pledge or pawn, of any firearm as security for the payment or repayment of money.\n \n \n (21) The term \"engaged in the business\" means -\n \n \n (C) as applied to a dealer in firearms, as defined in section 921(a)(11)(A), a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms;\n \n (22) The term \"with the principal objective of livelihood and profit\" means that the intent underlying the sale or disposition of firearms is predominantly one of obtaining livelihood and pecuniary gain, as opposed to other intents, such as improving or liquidating a personal firearms collection: Provided, That proof of profit shall not be required as to a person who engages in the regular and repetitive purchase and disposition of firearms for criminal purposes or terrorism. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"terrorism\" means activity, directed against United States persons, which -\n (A) is committed by an individual who is not a national or permanent resident alien of the United States;\n (B) involves violent acts or acts dangerous to human life which would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States; and\n (C) is intended -\n (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;\n (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or\n (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by assassination or kidnapping.\n \n (bold emphasis added)\n \n Regarding background checks:\n \n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923 requires background checks for all transfers involving FFL dealers, regardless of the location. Background checks are not required for private collection transfers or sales under federal law, regardless of whether they happen at a gun show or someone&#8217;s home or the parking lot of their work place. \n \n Hope this helps your understanding of the federal regulatory scheme....",

A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n Here is another report produced by Australian Institute of Criminology here called   Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a article about is in the report here.\n Link  Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld' \nCANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. &#8230;. reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation,  they have failed to deter hard-core criminals.

   "I'm not going to argue this in the Australia thread. Instead I'm bringing it back to where it belongs.\n \n \n\"But far and away, the leading proximate source of crime guns is the private sales market. More than 85% of recovered crime guns have gone through at least one private party transaction following their initial sale by a licensed retailer.\"\n http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/vprp/pdf/IGS/IGSexecsummweb.pdf\n\n \n Give me a f***in' break! The UC David School of Medicine? What does a doctor's group know about the effectiveness of laws? These people are trained for diagnosing contagious diseases, not evaluated 300 page law proposals.\n \n And now let's point out the shortcomings of this \"study\" that you chose to cite.\n \n \"Undocumented private party transactions account for as many as 40% of all gun sales.\"\n \n If they're undocumented then how did they determine that they account for 40% of all transactions?\n \n \"Gun shows are studded with \"Private Sale\" signs that convey to all this message: No paperwork, no background check, no waiting period, no recordkeeping.\"\n \n I've seen no proof that such signs exist.\n \n \"Large gun shows will frequently have one or more licensed retailers sell-ing automatic weapons (typically submachine guns) and other devices regulated by the National Firearms Act.\"\n \n Again, where's the proof?\n \n \"But less than 2% of felons incarcerated for crimes involving guns acquired those guns themselves at gun shows. This poses a seeming paradox: How can gun shows be an impor-tant source of crime guns if criminals get their guns elsewhere?\"\n \n This is self explanatory. If gun shows really are the no holds barred situation that this guy is trying to make us believe that they are, then why aren't the number of criminals who got their guns at gun shows so much higher than less than 2%? Hell people are arguing that gun shows are responsible for 90% of the guns found in Mexico, so how could only 2% of our criminals have access to guns through the same channels?\n \n And then there's Garen Wintemute, the guy behind this article. Wintemute is one of the most notorious anti-gun figureheads that can be found outside of the Joyce Foundation or Violence Policy Center. The hyperbole statement \"teddy bears are covered by more regulations than guns are\" is attributed directly to him. He's made the argument that there's no oversight in the safety testing of firearms made in America, that there's no standardized tests to guarantee that firearms are safe to use.\n \n Wintemute has gone further in his damn lies by claiming that there were laws in place that forbade the ATF from ever tracing firearms for any reason and that they have no regulatory power over firearms design. He's also talked about how various gun manufacturers have no safeguards to prevent \"six thousand guns\" from being stolen directly from the factory that made them, and that they're not concerned with such thefts taking place.\n \n And then there's Wintemute's long and hate filled rants about \"Saturday Night Specials\" and his blaming them for all of the social ills America is faced with, trying to paint them as the absolute prime choice of guns for criminals, even though he claims that they're unsafe, unreliable, inaccurate, dangerous to handle, and minute in caliber and effectiveness.\n \n Your Wintemute article is no more an effective debate tool than something released by the Violence Policy Center or the Brady Campaign!",

   "Ask a cop on the beat how criminals get guns and you're likely to hear this hard boiled response: \"They steal them.\" But this street wisdom is wrong, according to one frustrated Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) agent who is tired of battling this popular misconception. An expert on crime gun patterns, ATF agent Jay Wachtel says that most guns used in crimes are not stolen out of private gun owners' homes and cars. \"Stolen guns account for only about 10% to 15% of guns used in crimes,\" Wachtel said. Because when they want guns they want them immediately the wait is usually too long for a weapon to be stolen and find its way to a criminal.\n \n \n In fact, there are a number of sources that allow guns to fall into the wrong hands, with gun thefts at the bottom of the list. Wachtel says one of the most common ways criminals get guns is through straw purchase sales. A straw purchase occurs when someone who may not legally acquire a firearm, or who wants to do so anonymously, has a companion buy it on their behalf. According to a 1994 ATF study on \"Sources of Crime Guns in Southern California,\" many straw purchases are conducted in an openly \"suggestive\" manner where two people walk into a gun store, one selects a firearm, and then the other uses identification for the purchase and pays for the gun. Or, several underage people walk into a store and an adult with them makes the purchases. Both of these are illegal activities.\n \n \n The next biggest source of illegal gun transactions where criminals get guns are sales made by legally licensed but corrupt at-home and commercial gun dealers. Several recent reports back up Wachtel's own studies about this, and make the case that illegal activity by those licensed to sell guns, known as Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs), is a huge source of crime guns and greatly surpasses the sale of guns stolen from John Q. Citizen. Like bank robbers, who are interested in banks, gun traffickers are interested in FFLs because that's where the guns are. This is why FFLs are a large source of illegal guns for traffickers, who ultimately wind up selling the guns on the street.\n \n \n According to a recent ATF report, there is a significant diversion to the illegal gun market from FFLs. The report states that \"of the 120,370 crime guns that were traced to purchases from the FFLs then in business, 27.7 % of these firearms were seized by law enforcement in connection with a crime within two years of the original sale. This rapid `time to crime' of a gun purchased from an FFL is a strong indicator that the initial seller or purchaser may have been engaged in unlawful activity.\" \n \n \n The report goes on to state that \"over-the-counter purchases are not the only means by which guns reach the illegal market from FFLs\" and reveals that 23,775 guns have been reported lost, missing or stolen from FFLs since September 13, 1994, when a new law took effect requiring dealers to report gun thefts within 48 hours. This makes the theft of 6,000 guns reported in the CIR/Frontline show \"Hot Guns\" only 25% of all cases reported to ATF in the past two and one-half years.\n \n \n Another large source of guns used in crimes are unlicensed street dealers who either get their guns through illegal transactions with licensed dealers, straw purchases, or from gun thefts. These illegal dealers turn around and sell these illegally on the street. An additional way criminals gain access to guns is family and friends, either through sales, theft or as gifts.\n \n \n While many guns are taken off the street when people are arrested and any firearms in their possession are confiscated, a new study shows how easily arrestees believe they could illegally acquire another firearm. Supported by the National Institute of Justice and based on interviews with those recently arrested, the study acknowledges gun theft is common, with 13 percent of all arrestees interviewed admitting that they had stolen a gun. However a key finding is that \"the illegal market is the most likely source\" for these people to obtain a gun. \"In fact, more than half the arrestees say it is easy to obtain guns illegally,\" the report states. Responding to a question of how they obtained their most recent handgun, the arrestees answered as follows: 56% said they paid cash; 15% said it was a gift; 10% said they borrowed it; 8% said they traded for it; while 5% only said that they stole it.\n \n \n ATF officials say that only about 8% of the nation's 124,000 retail gun dealers sell the majority of handguns that are used in crimes. They conclude that these licensed retailers are part of a block of rogue entrepreneurs tempted by the big profits of gun trafficking. Cracking down on these dealers continues to be a priority for the ATF. What's needed, according to Wachtel, is better monitoring of the activities of legally licensed gun dealers. This means examining FFL paperwork to see where their guns are coming from, and making sure that those guns are being sold legally. But he says, \"Let's be honest. If someone wants a gun, it's obvious the person will not have difficulty buying a gun, either legally or through the extensive United States black market.\" \n frontline: hot guns: \"How Criminals Get Guns\" | PBS\n \n So much for the idea the law abiding are a problem.",

   "Why are we targeting guns instead of criminals?\n \n ON AUG. 6, Governor Corzine signed S1774 into law - legislation making it a crime to exercise the constitutional right to obtain a handgun any more often than Big Brother dictates - even after waiting as long as six months for permits and being prequalified by the state after a thorough police investigation.\n \n It's overkill in the extreme, based on the false and unsupportable premise that criminals and their surrogates buy their crime guns from New Jersey dealers, after marching down to police headquarters to volunteer for fingerprinting, background checks and extensive personal disclosures.\n \n The theory is that reducing the overall number of handguns will somehow reduce gun crime, which is a little like saying that reducing the overall number of cars will reduce drunk driving. It's absurd, because criminals are not deterred when a particular tool becomes less available.\n \n Not only that, but criminals laugh at laws like S1774, because they don't follow the law to begin with, and they certainly don't get their guns from New Jersey dealers - only law-abiding citizens do, so only honest folks are impacted by the legislation.\n \n Gun-rationing schemes like S1774 have been tried before in other states, but they have either been repealed or shown ineffective, since criminals bent on illegal trafficking can spread purchases among multiple buyers in lieu of a single buyer purchasing multiple guns.\n \n S1774 does nothing to punish criminal behavior with guns, and it ignores known sources of illegal trafficking, like the FedEx theft ring that recently stole hundreds of handguns from legal shipments and distributed them in Jersey City and Newark - cities plagued by illegal guns. But instead of calling for laws mandating background checks on shipping employees who handle sensitive packages, or requiring special safeguards on those packages, the State House has chosen to target the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.\n \n Discredited claim\n \n The claim by supporters of S1774 that state-certified law-abiding New Jerseyans are magically transformed into violent criminals and illegal gun traffickers when they buy more than one handgun on the same day (after waiting months for permits) has been thoroughly discredited and disproven. These claims are based on deceptive parsing of statistics and disingenuous use of misunderstood Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) nomenclature to falsely characterize guns recovered from house fires, floods, natural disasters, estates and gun buybacks as \"crime guns.\"\n \n Moreover, ATF data released for 2007, falsely cited in support of handgun rationing, fails to correlate New Jersey multiple purchases with crime gun traces, providing no evidence whatsoever that government-monitored multiple handgun sales in New Jersey result in gun crime or illegal trafficking.\n \n The only publicly available ATF statistics show, irrefutably, that less than one-half of 1 percent of guns traced by ATF originated as New Jersey multiple handgun sales, which also means that more than 99 percent of traces originated as individual (not multiple) sales.\n \n There simply is no evidence that licensed multiple sales in New Jersey are trafficked or used in crime by their purchasers, and objective evidence demonstrates precisely the opposite.\n \n Were that true, personal data gathered in the intrusive licensing process would lead authorities straight to the culprits. But that doesn't happen, because criminals don't get guns that way.\n \n Ironically, gun rationing schemes like S1774 effectively end the mandated reporting of multiple handgun sales by dealers to the federal authorities who investigate them.\n Losing an effective tool\n \n According to a former chief of the ATF National Tracing Center, who testified against S1774 before a state Senate committee last year, ending the reporting of multiple sales \"eliminates an important law enforcement tool in the detection and interdiction of possible illegal gun trafficking, and also makes it easier for illegal traffickers to evade detection, since authorities are no longer alerted to the occurrence of multiple sales.\"\n \n The outcry against S1774 by law-abiding gun owners caused the governor to take the unusual step of forming a task force to study the law's impact on honest citizens prior to implementation. Public hearings are expected, but cynics worry that the process is an election-year stunt and that the legislation's seriously flawed exemptions for dealers and collectors will not be meaningfully addressed.\n \n Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain: This state needs tough laws that severely punish violent criminal behavior with guns, not off-target laws that restrict the constitutional rights of honest people instead.",

   "You know you standing next to a cannon really just makes me wonder how far your willing to stretch your second amendment rights.\n\n \n Stretch? How exactly is a cannon a stretch. Cannons are fully legal to own, and the ATF doesn't even recognize them as true weapons. You don't need any special paperwork to own a cannon, just several thousand dollars to actually buy one.\n \n \nRegistration is necessary to trace the weapon back to the original owner Sarge.\n\n \n Oh come on, you don't expect us to believe this bull**** do you?\n \n If registration is necessary to trace firearms, then how can the police perform a trace of a gun retrieved from a crime scene and report what store it was stolen from, if the criminal who stole it never bothered to register it in the first place?\n \n And then there's the news article about the cache of several thousand weapons being confiscated from Mexico. They claim most of them were traced back to Texas. But how is that possible when Texas doesn't require firearms registration?\n \n \nI know you fear the long hair'd hippies will take yer guns away\n\n \n They have in the past.\n \n And something else you should know. Maintaining a central registry of firearms is illegal, that's been the law since 1986 and nobody's been able to even try and change that fact. So when people like you talk about gun registration, your discussion basically runs along the lines of talking about how you should break the law and commit an illegal act.\n \n \nbut don't worry you'll still have the right to brandish a device which soul purpose is to destroy another human being...\n\n \n You're comparing our well established, constitutionally recognized, Supreme Court reaffirmed, rights to protect ourselves from harm to a criminal's willful disregard for life and the murdering of innocents?\n \n Who's the long haired hippie now?\n \n \nNo one should be able to buy a firearm unless they have had proven education and training in the handling of the weapon.\n\n \n The Supreme Court disagrees with you. They've said no such practices may be implemented for the exercising of any right.\n \n \nBeing ex Navy do you think they would dare entrust us with a live firearm without proper training? Hell no...\n\n \n And what exactly qualifies as \"proper training\" to someone like you? Justify yourself.\n \n \nSuch a thing needs to be implemented for not only proper handling cleaning and assembly, but how to avoid accidents that could prove fatal to the user or other around them...\n\n \n Accidents happen, there's no way to stop them.\n \n Accidents happen even with the military and police, and they're supposed to have arguably the best damn training of anybody!\n \n \nAs for registration it's necessary. Just like when the Navy has a proper record and log to trace who and when and where a firearm is going such should be implemented on a federal level.\n\n \n Again, you're advocating clearly illegal practices. What's with you, are you a criminal? Various other countries have such practices, and we keep hearing about how crime ridden they are.\n \n \nI also believe that no one should be able to purchase automatic rifles period... There is no need for a civilian to have such a deadly piece of equipment, let alone have it not knowing how to use it.\n\n \n So even with the type of registration you support, being in place for automatic weapons as it is already, you still believe that's not good enough?\n \n Explain yourself!\n \n \nSure you say guns don't kill people but people kill people, but the gun is only a tool or a means to that end. Limit the tools to take a human life and you may end up saving a few in the long run....\n\n \n This same argument has been used time and time again. And everytime it's used we point out how many thousands of people are killed by IEDs and suicide bombers. Or we point to the african countries where hundreds of thousands of people who brutally butchered with nothing more than machetes. No matter what, we always prove this statement of yours wrong, and we'll continue to do so.\n \n The only lives you'd wind up saving are the lives of vicious criminals.

   "Seems to me some people want to be slaves or else they imagine themselves as slavemasters, the elite :( putting themselves above the Rule of Law.\n \n Jacob Sullum : From Guns to Butter - Townhall.com\n \n \n\n In the 1856 case Dred Scott v. Sandford, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the idea that Africans and their descendants in the United States could be \"entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens.\" To emphasize how absurd that notion was, Chief Justice Roger Taney noted that, among other things, those \"privileges and immunities\" would allow members of \"the unhappy black race\" to \"keep and carry arms wherever they went.\" \n \n The 14th Amendment, approved in the wake of the Civil War, repudiated Taney's view of the Constitution, declaring that \"no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens,\" who include \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States.\" Just four years after the amendment was ratified, however, the Supreme Court interpreted the Privileges or Immunities Clause so narrowly that a dissenting justice said it had been transformed into a \"vain and idle enactment.\" The Court now has a chance to rectify that mistake -- fittingly enough, in a case involving the right to arms. <snip<\n \n its supporters also were concerned about economic liberty: the right to own and exchange property, make and enforce contracts, and work in the occupation of one's choice -- all freedoms the Southern states tried to deny former slaves. \n",

   "  A Supreme Court gunfight -- A Chicago gun-control case will hinge on the 14th Amendment and the Bill of Rights. \n If you support measures to reduce gun violence, as this page does, it's tempting to hope that the court will rule that states aren't bound by the 2nd Amendment. The problem is that allowing states (and cities) to ignore this part of the Bill of Rights could undermine the requirement that they abide by others.\n \n Landmark civil liberties decisions spanning eight decades were possible only because the justices concluded that key protections of the Bill of Rights applied to the states, because those rights were \"incorporated\" by the 14th Amendment. Added to the Constitution after the Civil War, that amendment includes these words: \"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n \n That language doesn't explicitly refer to any portion of the Bill of Rights adopted in 1791. But the court has held that many of those rights, including freedom of the press and freedom from unreasonable searches -- along with \"unenumerated\" ones such as a right to abortion -- are protected by the 14th Amendment's due process clause forbidding states from abridging \"liberty\" without due process. By contrast, the court has derived few rights from the clause referring to the \"privileges\" and \"immunities\" of citizenship.\n \n In the Chicago case, the justices are considering whether the 2nd Amendment should be applied to the states by either the 14th Amendment's due process clause (which applies to \"persons\") or its privileges and immunities clause (which protects only citizens). The court should say yes, even as it reaffirms its assurance in its 2008 decision that government may still impose reasonable restrictions on the right to bear arms. \n \n This is no time for the court to start picking and choosing when it comes to the Bill of Rights.\n\n Well well well!

   "Well what do you know, so am I and my whole family.\n\n \n Good for you. I was responding to Sarges assumption I was not American for some odd reason...\n \n \n \n \nWe've got approximately 30,000 gun laws in this country as it is. Most of them that would put dangerous individuals away for a long time are never used. So we're not in the mood to discuss future restrictions that won't be used either.\n \n \n Not in the mood? Oh I see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do. Excellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions....\n \n \n \n \nTell you what. We have more experience on the matters at hand. We'll decide what the legal guidelines should be.\n\n \n Who is we? You mean your pals that own over 15 firearms and gloat? I would rather trust others whom are unbiased and look at this issue with facts and methodical patience weighing both sides equally. \n \n \nJohn Kerry tried to look pro-gun with a late season, Canadian goose hunt in order to swing pro-gun votes over to his side. But unlike the wild ducks some of us hunt, we can see through the decoys and the marsh blinds used to distract us.\n\n \n What in the hell does John Kerry have to do with this? This is an issue of regulation not putting on a face to win votes in an already past election. If you mean by generalizing that all Democrats are against gun rights sorry but that's a false pretense formed on your own ignorance.\n \n \n \nHave you ever seen the videos on Youtube of the police officer giving the demonstration on gun safety in class, and wound up shooting himself in the foot? Or the video of the police officer holding the suspect at gunpoint on the ground, and she wound up pulling the trigger and almost shooting the guy in the head? Or how about the news report about a SWAT officer leaving his M4 carbine behind at the scene of a crime when they were leaving, and it wasn't retrieved until hours later?\n\n \n Actually no I have not and once again those are isolated incidents of once again negligence and lack of training and just common sense. \n \n \nThere's a lot of evidence showing that the firearms training of the professionals isn't adequate, it's not even on par with what most civilians have. So instead of mandating it, which is what they get, how about let us decide which training to seek out and do it willingly instead of begrudgingly?\n \n \n Certainly NATO. And what about those civilians that think they do not need any training but wind up blowing their limbs off my mistake? Or not knowing what to do when a weapon jams or how to assemble and disassemble a weapon? \n \n And please for humor's sake show me this evidence that the \"professionals\" are not as knowledgeable than the civilians in this matter... \n \n \nWhen you want to learn something of your own free will, you're more likely to retain the information and pay attention than if you're forced to by law.\n\n \n Or is that how you learn only NATO? Such information and learning should be received warmly by those owning a firearm. It is the means to provide that training that is the issue at hand not the desire...\n \n \n \nOthers have claimed the same thing. But their positions say otherwise.\n\n \n And your point is what? All gun supporters are two faced? Or just Democrats?\n \n \n \n \nNegligible by who's decision? Who gets to have the say over a matter like this?\n I don't know NATO how about the people for one....\n \n \n \n \nWhere's the budget for something like this going to come from? And if registration/training is made mandatory, what's to prevent a backdoor DC/Chicago style gun ban done through cutting the budget for registration and training programs?\n\n \n How about federal regulation of such training and funding could be provided by say federal levels or maybe by the purchasing of firearms. You want to use and operate a weapon your gonna need to pay to ensure those like you get proper training and handling of such a weapon as well.\n \n Gasp! Restricting guns and taxes!

   "Not in the mood? Oh I see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do.\n\n \n You misunderstand. I'm fully willing to get rid of every single regulation that doesn't work and has absolutely no crime fighting benefit. But everytime we make suggestions for compromise, we're called unreasonable.\n \n I could make out a list of all the restrictions I'm in favor of repealing, but if I did that I'd just be called an extremist who doesn't care about the lives of innocent people. But screw that and the horse too, I'm gonna do it.\n \n The restrictions I'd like to see repealed include but are not limited to:\n \n -The \"sporting purpose\" standard\n -Gun rationing\n -Waiting periods\n -Ballistics databases\n -Permit to purchase/own\n -Mandatory storage\n -Mandatory training\n -Mandatory registration\n -Mandatory theft or loss reporting\n -Magazine capacity limitations\n -Mandatory fingerprinting\n -Bans on commonly available firearms\n -The Lautenburg Amendment\n -The Gun Free School Zones Act\n -City based home rule authority\n -Importation restrictions\n -Bans on types of ammunition\n -Bans on affordable guns\n -Bans on military surplus ammunition\n \n Not a single one of these laws has helped catch a single criminal, or saved a single life. They serve no purpose other than to hurt the people that have done nothing wrong.\n \n I'd love to see the laws that punished violent offenders, actually enforced. If you have a gun when you commit a serious crime, that earns you five years in a federal prison, no parole. If you traffic guns to criminals, you get ten years in a federal prison, no parole, for every gun you trafficked (that's a life sentence for the professionals). But nobody's willing to enforce these laws, instead gun charges are almost immediately dropped, plea bargained away in favor of less serious charges that make a mockery of the justice system. Instead of attempted murder, you get conspiracy to commit murder. Instead of first degree murder, you get second degree manslaughter. Where's the justice in it all?\n \n \nExcellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions....\n\n \n Just like the liberals with their proposals for more gun control laws, rather than laws that abuse violent criminals and make life impossible for them?\n \n \nWho is we? You mean your pals that own over 15 firearms and gloat?\n\n \n Is there a problem with such amounts of ownership?\n \n \nI would rather trust others whom are unbiased and look at this issue with facts and methodical patience weighing both sides equally.\n \n \n You mean like the politicians who have body guards armed with machine guns, who don't have to live on the same streets as those they seek to tell \"You can't have a gun unless you own it the way I tell you to\"? The ones who keep telling us how much good will come from this proposed law, even when the data released by the Justice Department shows that the claims are completely untrue?\n \n \nWhat in the hell does John Kerry have to do with this?\n\n \n He was anti-gun and tried to claim otherwise by going hunting. Your posts seem to follow in his footsteps. \"Oh I don't like the free ownership of firearms that people in this country enjoy, but my family owns a gun so I'm not anti-gun\". Yeah right, this dog and pony show gets you nowhere.\n \n \nThis is an issue of regulation not putting on a face to win votes in an already past election. If you mean by generalizing that all Democrats are against gun rights sorry but that's a false pretense formed on your own ignorance.\n\n \n My own ignorance hell. I came from Britain, I know more about gun control and its evils that you ever will.\n \n \nActually no I have not and once again those are isolated incidents of once again negligence and lack of training and just common sense.\n \n \n \nCertainly NATO. And what about those civilians that think they do not need any training but wind up blowing their limbs off my mistake?\n\n \n You claim that military and police **** ups are nothing more than isolated incidents, but you've presented absolutely no evidence to prove that reports like this almost never happen.\n \n And what evidence do you have to show that civilian **** ups aren't also isolated incidents that are extremely rare and far from the norm? Are we expected to just take your word for it?\n \n \nOr not knowing what to do when a weapon jams or how to assemble and disassemble a weapon?\n\n \n I think you just slit your own throat with this statement. If you really were a gun owner, then you'd know firearms come with detailed instruction manuals to address these claims. They show step by step how to disassemble and reassemble a firearm, and how to do it right.\n \n \nAnd please for humor's sake show me this evidence that the \"professionals\" are not as knowledgeable than the civilians in this matter...\n\n \n As soon as you present the evidence that if we don't have mandatory training, then we're just gonna keep killing each other by mistake because we don't know any better.\n \n \nOr is that how you learn only NATO? Such information and learning should be received warmly by those owning a firearm. It is the means to provide that training that is the issue at hand not the desire...\n\n \n Trying to legislate common sense will get you nowhere. Requiring proof of competence before exercising a right is an unconstitutional practice, as said by the Supreme Court. You can neither be taxed to exercise a right, nor required to prove your own competence in order to do so. So quit supporting illegal practices.\n \n \nAnd your point is what? All gun supporters are two faced? Or just Democrats?\n\n \n Just the ones who claim we need this law, and that law, and this other law, and these ten other laws, etc.\n \n \nI don't know NATO how about the people for one....\n\n \n Too often \"the people\" are politicians who don't know their head from a hole in the ground. They shouldn't be allowed to have a say in the matter, especially when their voting records show that they've in favor of anything and everything that would further limit the extent of our rights.\n \n \nHow about federal regulation of such training and funding could be provided by say federal levels or maybe by the purchasing of firearms. You want to use and operate a weapon your gonna need to pay to ensure those like you get proper training and handling of such a weapon as well.\n\n \n I suppose a person should also have to pay a monthly tax to exercise their 4th Amendment rights? \"You can't execute a search warrant of my home! You have no evidence, no probable cause, and I pay the $300 a month fees to keep you from coming onto my property!\"\n \n And you still haven't explained what steps would be taken to prevent the backdoor gun bans that DC and Chicago enacted. Their laws specified that only registered guns could be owned, and then they passed a law that put a permanent end to the registration programs.",

Yet, accidental\n firearm fatalities have declined dramatically during\n this time and are at their lowest levels since statistics\n were first compiled a century ago. Over the past 70\n years, due in large part to industry-sponsored gun\n safety and hunter education efforts, overall accidental\n firearm deaths have declined more than 70%\n from an average of 3,000 deaths annually in the\n 1920s and 1930s to 800 in 2002. According to the\n National Safety Council (NSC), such tragic accidents\n have declined 43% from 1992-2002.\n In the home, accidental firearm fatalities have\n been reduced by 50% between 1992 and 2002, from\n 1,000 to 500 annually.\n The National Safety Council ranks firearm accidents\n among the lowest of all causes of unintentional\n deaths. For example, NSC statistics for 2002 show\n 44,000 deaths related to motor vehicle accidents,\n 14,500 to falls, 3,000 to drowning, 2,900 to fires or\n burns, 4,200 to choking and 15,700 to poisoning.\n \n Consider these facts the NSSF states so eloquently:\n \n In the past 10 years, firearm-related accidents in the home have dropped by more than 44 percent! \n Over the past 9 years, the number of unintentional firearm-related fatalities for children 14 and under has decreased by 69 percent! \n Firearms are involved in fewer than 1.2 percent of accidental fatalities among children 14 and under! \n The number of unintentional firearm-related deaths has decreased by 40 percent - from 1,225 accidental deaths in 1995 to just 730 in 2005! \n Accidental fatality rates involving firearms are at the lowest levels in history at 0.2% per 100,000 population! \n Since 1903, the rate per 100,000 population of accidental fatality rates has declined by 94 percent! \n Of firearms, fires, flames, smoke, motor vehicles, and ingestion of food or objects, unintentional fatalities in the USA from firearms had the largest rate of decrease in the past decade! \n More people died from natural heat or cold in 2005 (the final year in the study) than by firearms! \n The record-high year of firearm-related accidents was in 1930 where America experienced 3,220 incidents. In 2005 this number had dropped to only 730 in spite of the fact that the population grew considerably and the number of firearms present in America skyrocketed! \n If you really want a safe sport, go hunting! In 2005, there were 808 non-fatal shooting accidents and 95 fatal shooting accidents out of 20.9 million active hunters (those who hunt more than once each year aged 7 and older). Cheerleading, Archery, Baseball, Boxing, Football, Hockey, Martial Arts, Mountain Biking, Mountain Climbing, Skateboarding, Snowboarding, Soccer, Softball, Tennis, Volleyball, Water Skiing, and Wrestling each had fewer participants and more injuries than hunting! \n In addition, I realize than a firearm-related injury is likely more serious than a tennis injury. Yet the fact that there were fewer tennis players than hunters but almost 19,000 more accidental injuries from tennis in 2005 means that the incessant harping we hear from the anti-gun, freedom-hating, America-loathing pundits is steeped in lies, untruths, and exaggerations.",

   "Good for you. I was responding to Sarges assumption I was not American for some odd reason...\n \n \n \n \n \n Not in the mood? Oh I see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do. Excellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions....\n \n \n \n \n \n Who is we? You mean your pals that own over 15 firearms and gloat? I would rather trust others whom are unbiased and look at this issue with facts and methodical patience weighing both sides equally. \n \n \n \n What in the hell does John Kerry have to do with this? This is an issue of regulation not putting on a face to win votes in an already past election. If you mean by generalizing that all Democrats are against gun rights sorry but that's a false pretense formed on your own ignorance.\n \n \n \n \n Actually no I have not and once again those are isolated incidents of once again negligence and lack of training and just common sense. \n \n \n \n Certainly NATO. And what about those civilians that think they do not need any training but wind up blowing their limbs off my mistake? Or not knowing what to do when a weapon jams or how to assemble and disassemble a weapon? \n \n And please for humor's sake show me this evidence that the \"professionals\" are not as knowledgeable than the civilians in this matter... \n \n \n \n Or is that how you learn only NATO? Such information and learning should be received warmly by those owning a firearm. It is the means to provide that training that is the issue at hand not the desire...\n \n \n \n \n And your point is what? All gun supporters are two faced? Or just Democrats?\n \n \n \n I don't know NATO how about the people for one....\n \n \n \n \n \n How about federal regulation of such training and funding could be provided by say federal levels or maybe by the purchasing of firearms. You want to use and operate a weapon your gonna need to pay to ensure those like you get proper training and handling of such a weapon as well.\n \n Gasp! Restricting guns and taxes! I bet I XXXXXX alot of people off right now...\n\n \n Everything you said you want, you had in jolly old England so why the heck did you immigrate over here. You remind me of kalifornia folk who move to another State to get away from all the emoticon_xclown then want to adopt all the laws they fled to escape, they are so enlightened :(\n \n Did your daddy and mommy and you get training when he got his .357? More important, have you read the founding documents of this REPUBLIC and the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution? Other than the small part you knew would be on the 'test'? I imagine not. You realize what the war of Independence was about don't you? Taxes and guns! that's it, plain and simple and The Rule of Law.\n \n Now you going to fit in or continue to be a festering boil on the rear?",

   "You say regulation ends up as a nightmare when it comes into regulation. How so? Why does having some sort of legally binding recognition of your ownership of a firearm trump your right to own it? It doesn't! \n\n Well, JazyJason, it is over regulation that is becoming the problem. \n   The \"Unregulated\" Gun  \n \"Gun Laws of America is 384 pages of just the federal statutes that regulate guns-more than 88,000 words. Additionally, the associated federal regulations interpreting these laws are even larger. Minimum penalty for a violation is typically 5 years in federal prison for every offense.\n \n It is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America. Those laws include restrictions on possession, carry, distribution, storage, transfer, manufacture, sale, ownership, importation, use and more. \n\n And then there was all of this during the 2nd Amendment HATING Clinton Administration.\n 1.Brady background checks for all handgun buyers, \n 2.institution of the waiting period,\n 3. Making it illegal for anyone under 18 to own or even possess a handgun.\n 4. The President's executive order stopping the importation of many guns,\n 5. Excessive fees and regulations that drove many legitimate gun shop owners out of business.\n 6. The widening of Brady to include background checks from just handguns to include all new firearm purchases. \n 7. Insta Check! \n 8. Additional disqualification's and changes to legal firearms purchases on form 4473, \n 9. The assault weapons ban. Sunset.\n 10. The ten round magazine, Sunset.\n 11 Lautenburg.\n \n and just recently the NICS improvement act!\n \n \nAnd yes I am particular on the type of firearm. I see no need for anyone to own an automatic rifle period. Being one trained in the usage and skill of firing and using this weapon for it's intended purpose, I see why no civilian should have a form of a military grade automatic rifle period.\n \n Well, good for you. We can see that you know what you would not like to have. And first of all, it is semi autos. Automatic weapons are machine guns. Strictly regulated!\n \n \n As far as knowing what type of firearm or how many that is your business and your purchase. \n\n Semi Autos soak up recoil and allow for a quick followup shot, which many sporting competitions require. In fact, I have some spinal cord problems from shooting over and under shotguns for all of my life. If I had been using a semi auto, my problems may never have developed. Softer recoil.\n \n \nHowever, you say people publish names of gun owners and such in newspapers as a form of slander or targeting. Of what? Why would they target you? If you are adhering tostate and federal guidelines of ownership then why bother?\n\n A thief now knows EXACTLY where the guns are. He watches, and waits till you leave, then breaks in and takes exactly what he wants. That is, if you are lucky! Maybe he just breaks in in the middle of the night, and knowing that you are armed, just kills everyone who confronts him! Meaning Our Families! Thanks jazyjason for being so careless as to let your hate for Concealed Carry kill my family! OK. A bit over the top, but I am sure you get the picture. It is a theft hazard. \n \nI think your blowing such isolated incidents out of proportion and furthermore, think that ANY regulation or restriction is a direct front to your right to have a weapon. Point being, that such things do not take away your right or your ability to defend life and property. But rather ensures that those who have no business owning a firearm or obtaining one obtain one.\n \n Sure these people can obtain a firearm through non legal means, but guidelines must be followed for the publics safety and well being. And if anything I think the NRA and others should step up their education and training in firearms. Too many accidents and incidents occur by misuse and owner negligence.\n\n You are assuming that gun control laws work! There are already plenty in place to keep society safe, as was demonstrated earlier. The Antis are Constitutional Rights hogs. They just do not know when or how to stop. In fact they will never stop till the 2nd id Dead! Ask Galileo. \n \n But then there is this. \n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n  What did they find?  \n \"the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.\" \n\n The CDC suggest more studies, because they did not get the results that they were looking for. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n Here is an article about the study Link  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n \n Now what say ye? How can anyone defend taking even more of what the Constitution Guarantees will not be infringed?",

   "jazyjason\n \n Australia.   Police hunt armed bandits targeting gun stashes in homes \n POLICE are hunting armed bandits who have stolen more than $30,000 worth of guns in targeted home invasions\n \n Police fear the guns could be sold on the black market or used to commit further violent crimes. \n \n The chilling ambush attacks on family homes in Trafalgar, on August 19, and Hampton Park, in June, are almost identical, with a crew of five masked men storming both houses in search for guns.\n \n \n In the Hampton Park attack, a woman and her three teenage children were tied up as their father was made to open a safe containing $25,000 worth of high-powered pistols. \n \n At the Trafalgar home, a woman, eight months pregnant, was pushed to the ground and bound as her husband was forced to retrieve $10,000 worth of guns from a safe and hand them over. \n \n Apparently the thieves follow the Registered gun owners home from their gun club and make them open their safes!

   "How exactly am I threatneing Sarge? And how am I part of some psrt of ilk? You speak of owning a weapon as if someone is trying to suck the life out of you if they dare regulate or restrict in some fashion.\n\n \n My advise is that you look at how Britain regulated guns, and see how it all happened. It started out innocently enough, requiring a permit and nothing else. And now today you have to get people to testify for you that you're of good moral and upstanding character, that you're not likely to use your granted firearms in a negative manner, letters from police chiefs, ex-wives, etc. proving that you have good reason for owning a gun, and you have to keep the keys to your government mandated gun safe hidden from anyone and everyone else.\n \n \nYou say regulation ends up as a nightmare when it comes into regulation. How so? Why does having some sort of legally binding recognition of your ownership of a firearm trump your right to own it? It doesn't!\n \n \n Ask anyone who ever owned an SKS in California. They registered them, and then they were confiscated and destroyed.\n \n \nAnd yes I am particular on the type of firearm. I see no need for anyone to own an automatic rifle period.\n\n \n What definition are you using when you refer to \"automatic\" in this context?\n \n \nBeing one trained in the usage and skill of firing and using this weapon for it's intended purpose, I see why no civilian should have a form of a military grade automatic rifle period.\n\n \n Well if you're referring to true machine guns, the kind that haven't been on the new civilian market since 1986, can you show any examples of anyone being killed with registered machine guns?\n \n \nHowever, you say people publish names of gun owners and such in newspapers as a form of slander or targeting. Of what? Why would they target you? If you are adhering tostate and federal guidelines of ownership then why bother?\n\n \n So you don't see the damage that can be done by releasing blanket lists of the names of known gun owners? Please tell me that's not your argument, otherwise that says you're extremely ignorant.\n \n If you are on the list, any criminal that reads the newspaper will know where you live, that you have at least one gun, and they might be inspired to stake out your place so they can steal them.\n \n If you aren't on the list, then criminals will target you because you come off as being a soft target that poses no risk to them.\n \n \nI think your blowing such isolated incidents out of proportion and furthermore, think that ANY regulation or restriction is a direct front to your right to have a weapon. Point being, that such things do not take away your right or your ability to defend life and property. But rather ensures that those who have no business owning a firearm or obtaining one obtain one.\n\n \n My father's prized pistol was confiscated and destroyed when we lived back in Britain. It was registered, that's how they knew where to send out the letters. It was a nickel-plated, ivory gripped, Colt Model 1903 in 7.65 Browning. It was appraised at a value of approximately USD$1,200. And the British government still required him to bring it forth so it could be cut in half with a power saw.\n \n You wanna try and tell us again how registration isn't a restriction on our rights? Every single one of us that has a brain and common sense, knows from history, that registration has always and without exception, preceded confiscation and made forced civilian disarmament a possibility. It's happened in Germany, Britain, Australia, Turkey, Japan, Africa, Ireland, Canada and Scotland.\n \n \nSure these people can obtain a firearm through non legal means, but guidelines must be followed for the publics safety and well being.\n\n \n Wow you really moved the goalposts on that one. Now it's no longer about controlling crime, it's about setting policy for public safety. Yeah that'll really work, \"You have to register their legally owned guns because we think you might be a threat to public safety\". Talk about discrimination!\n \n Why don't you require people to register their cameras because they're used to manufacturer child pornography?\n \n There are better programs to spend tens of billions of dollars on. There's absolutely no evidence that making the people comply with mandatory registration schemes, has done anything to stem the flow of illegal guns, or enable the police to better find a random shooter who opened fire into a crowd.\n \n You present no evidence, therefore you have no expectation for us to comply with your desires.\n \n \nAnd if anything I think the NRA and others should step up their education and training in firearms. Too many accidents and incidents occur by misuse and owner negligence.\n\n \n You need to provide evidence to back up your claim that there are too many accidents happening. We need round numbers to prove beyond reasonable doubt that you're not simply exploiting a few isolated events.",

   "Right Bryan. So how many of those private transactions put firearms in criminal hands, we can't say. But nothing prevents criminals from making these purchases and the seller needn't concern himself who the buyer is. What's the point of first buyer background checks but after that, who cares?\n\n \n No, we can't say. I understand your argument but we must remember that it remains illegal for any person to sell a firearm to someone he knows is disqualified from possessing one. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 is the federal code section which prohibits this, and has already been quoted before. Here is the relevant portion of my state's similar criminal statute:\n \n Any person who sells, barters, gives or furnishes, or has in his possession or under his control with the intent of selling, bartering, giving or furnishing, any firearm to any person he knows is prohibited from possessing or transporting a firearm pursuant to \u00a7 18.2-308.1:1, 18.2-308.2, subsection B of \u00a7 18.2-308.2:01, or \u00a7 18.2-308.7 shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:1\n \n Your argument is that without background checks the secondary market becomes a \"don't ask me no questions and I won't tell you no lies\" market. I understand this argument, but as I have argued before I see no way to enforce a secondary market transfer.",

   "Welcome jazyjason\n \n \n Registration is necessary to trace the weapon back to the original owner Sarge. \n\n \n This is incorrect. We are perfectly capable of tracing firearms back to the original owner with the system we now have. See\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/12824-gun-crime-gangs-again-7.html#post357039\n \n \n No one should be able to buy a firearm unless they have had proven education and training in the handling of the weapon. Being ex Navy do you think they would dare entrust us with a live firearm without proper training? Hell no... \n\n \n I would agree except the right is not bestowed upon us by a benevolent government which chooses to \"entrust\" us with it. It is not within the government's power to decide whether to \"trust\" me with this right any more that it is within its power to decide whether to \"trust\" me with the right of free speech.\n \n \n As for registration it's necessary.

You could follow me out the door and tell me \"there is no need\" for me to go to a particular church that day. You could follow me to a bookstore later that afternoon, watch me wander the aisles, and when you see something catch my eye you could step up beside me and say \"there is no need\" for me to have that particular book. And if I get stopped by the police for speeding on the way home you could stop as well and tell me \"there is no need\" for me to have a right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure when the officer asks that I let him search my car. And (assuming that you have not grown tired of me yet) you could follow me to the gun store on Monday so you could make sure to tell me \"there is no need\" for me to buy a particular firearm you happen to dislike. I like you just fine right now and probably would not mind the company. But just don't expect that I will pay much attention to any of your comments.

   "Is this where the antis on this board have received their marching orders? \n   NY Mayor Bloomberg steps up attacks on gun shows\n \n Lies, untruths, and deception like those characterize this \"investigation.\" Bloomberg has decided that as mayor of New York his jurisdiction extends throughout the country, despite previous warnings from Federal authorities that the investigations themselves might very well be illegal.\n \n If these investigators did indeed document illegal activity, why were the sellers allowed to continue with business? Why weren't the authorities notified so they could be arrested on the spot? All gun shows will remove a person from the show for breaking the law and most gun shows have police officers and/or agents from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms on site.\n \n Bloomberg blames the NRA, yet the NRA has consistently and unwaveringly supported arresting people who break the law. There is no \"gun show loophole,\" private sellers and commercial dealers operate under the same sets of laws regardless of where they make a sale. Criminals are buying guns on the streets, not from gun shows locked up tight with security and crawling with law enforcement. Bloomberg is doing nothing more than trying to push his anti-gun agenda and score political points with an anti-gun administration.\n\n \n \n   NY Mayor Bloomberg steps up attacks on gun shows\n \n Bloomberg reportedly sent undercover investigators to seven gun shows in Ohio, Nevada, and Tennessee last summer, targeting Dayton, Niles, Columbus, and Sharonville in Ohio. They claim that 74% of the dealers at these shows failed an \"integrity test\" and were willing to sell guns to these investigators who lied to the sellers about their intentions or background.\n \n But wait. Weren't the Bloomberg Illegal Mayors warned by the ATF that they were impeding that department's investigations, and what they were doing actually DID rise to a level of a crime? \n   Shops in clear on guns \n Various U.S. attorneys' offices and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined New York's findings against the dealers \"do not rise to a level that would support a criminal prosecution,\" according to a U.S. Department of Justice letter sent to New York City Hall on Tuesday, the New York Daily News reported.\n \n The agencies also warned New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration that it could face legal liabilities if it continues to conduct sting operations that fall within the jurisdiction of federal agents.\n\n EVEN MORE Illegal activity by the Illegal Mayors? Yet Again? \n \n I understand that You HATE the 2nd Amendment, and you want to do everything in your power to make trouble for the law-abiding, but there is a whole Federal Department who's sole responsibility is to deal with guns and gun selling crimes. Let them do their job.\n \n How about you Illegal Mayors spend your time of persecuting criminals, or does that make too much sense, because it might actually work, cause your TRUE intentions are to persecute the 2nd Amendment, and all who DARE to actually have the unmitigated audacity to actually participate in this Constitutionally recognized as protected Inalienable Right? \n \n The Nerve of Americans! Actually believing that the Constitution's Bill of Rights, prevents Government from infringing on their Rights! emoticon_smile\n \n Someone was keeping track of all of the Illegal mayors who themselves were found guilty, but gave up on it because it seemed to be an avery month thing, so here is a partial list. \n Mayors Against Illegal Guns - Shame List\n ----------------------------------------\n Samuel Rivera, Mayor Passaic NJ\n Convicted and imprisoned on federal corruption charges.\n \n Frank Melton, Mayor Jackson MS\n Federal civil rights charges of conspiracy to deny Constitutional rights ; hiding people wanted on criminal charges; carrying a concealed weapon.\n \n Kwame Kilpatrick, Mayor Detroit MI\n Jailed for perjury, misconduct and obstruction of justice.\n \n Larry Langford, Mayor Birmingham Al\n Indicted under federal charges, still under seal (believed to be payments received in return for county business).\n \n Sheila Dixon, Mayor Baltimore NJ\n Indicted on threat and perjury charges.\n \n Jeremiah Healey, Mayor Jersey City NJ\n Obstructing justice; resisting arrest; disorderly person charges; handcuffed (and nude) after a night of drinking.\n \n Gary Becker, Mayor Racine WI\n Arrested during a sex sting.

   "Is this where the antis on this board have received their marching orders? \n   NY Mayor Bloomberg steps up attacks on gun shows\n \n \n \n   NY Mayor Bloomberg steps up attacks on gun shows\n  \n But wait. Weren't the Bloomberg Illegal Mayors warned by the ATF that they were impeding that department's investigations, and what they were doing actually DID rise to a level of a crime? \n   Shops in clear on guns \n EVEN MORE Illegal activity by the Illegal Mayors? Yet Again? \n \n I understand that You HATE the 2nd Amendment, and you want to do everything in your power to make trouble for the law-abiding, but there is a whole Federal Department who's sole responsibility is to deal with guns and gun selling crimes. Let them do their job.\n \n How about you Illegal Mayors spend your time of persecuting criminals, or does that make too much sense, because it might actually work, cause your TRUE intentions are to persecute the 2nd Amendment, and all who DARE to actually have the unmitigated audacity to actually participate in this Constitutionally recognized as protected Inalienable Right? \n \n The Nerve of Americans! Actually believing that the Constitution's Bill of Rights, prevents Government from infringing on their Rights! emoticon_smile\n \n Someone was keeping track of all of the Illegal mayors who themselves were found guilty, but gave up on it because it seemed to be an avery month thing, so here is a partial list. \n Mayors Against Illegal Guns - Shame List\n ----------------------------------------\n Samuel Rivera, Mayor Passaic NJ\n Convicted and imprisoned on federal corruption charges.\n \n Frank Melton, Mayor Jackson MS\n Federal civil rights charges of conspiracy to deny Constitutional rights ; hiding people wanted on criminal charges; carrying a concealed weapon.\n \n Kwame Kilpatrick, Mayor Detroit MI\n Jailed for perjury, misconduct and obstruction of justice.\n \n Larry Langford, Mayor Birmingham Al\n Indicted under federal charges, still under seal (believed to be payments received in return for county business).\n \n Sheila Dixon, Mayor Baltimore NJ\n Indicted on threat and perjury charges.\n \n Jeremiah Healey, Mayor Jersey City NJ\n Obstructing justice; resisting arrest; disorderly person charges; handcuffed (and nude) after a night of drinking.\n \n Gary Becker, Mayor Racine WI\n Arrested during a sex sting. Possible charges: child enticement, possession of child pornography, attempted second-degree sexual assault of a child and misconduct in public office.\n\n \n You mean the perverts who have crime ridden cities trying to create a non hostile working environment for thugs and criminals are themselves thugs and criminals??? Oh the shame of it all. Too bad we don't still have that quaint old custom of a new suit of tar and feathers and a ride out of town on a rail! ",

Given the level of ignorance and uneducation demonstrated, I'd say its the media's black guns. Too much Hollywierd and TV. Since its firearms accidents he is will to tax and regulate us to death on I'd say he knows very little other than what the Brady bunch puts out. emoticon_xhoho",

   "[QUOTE]\nYou know you standing next to a cannon really just makes me wonder how far your willing to stretch your second amendment rights. Registration is necessary to trace the weapon back to the original owner Sarge. I know you fear the long hair'd hippies will take yer guns away but don't worry you'll still have the right to brandish a device which soul purpose is to destroy another human being...\n\n Yes we sure do fear them thar long haired hippies,or is it you fear the stories\n that you have heard from your parents?And since when did a gun have a \"sole\n purpose to kill other human beings?\"Think you've been listening to to many stories concerning guns and hippies.Besides how many of these \"long haired hippies\" fought in Vietnam?\"Boy\" maybe next time you see a \"long haired hippie\"thank him for using an \"automatic rifle\" on behest of this Country.\n And yes I'm taking \"long haired hippie\" in the context that I think you mean it.\n Stop living in never never land.\n \nNo one should be able to buy a firearm unless they have had proven education and training in the handling of the weapon. Being ex Navy do you think they would dare entrust us with a live firearm without proper training? Hell no...\n\n So is it firearm or automatic firearm?Please excuse, meant to say automatic rifle.So once again I have to say,who is providing all this training?police,some off shoot of who knows the VPA,CDC what?how much?Seems things are fine the way they are.\n Squid boy,yes the Navy would dare entrust with a \"live\" firearm,how else are you going to learn?do it all out of a book?or verbal instruction?\n \n \n \nSuch a thing needs to be implemented for not only proper handling cleaning and assembly, but how to avoid accidents that could prove fatal to the user or other around them..\n.\n Like Nato said they come with instructions,if not its not hard to find some.\n Personally I taught myself on a wide variety by the time I was 15. (no internet)Accidents that could be fatal, is what we called back then common sense. Oh yeah, when I said wide variety that didn't include \"automatic rifles\"\n as it was illegal to own them without a special permit.Something about a law passed in 1936 about automatic rifles, aka machine guns.\n \n \nAs for registration it's necessary. Just like when the Navy has a proper record and log to trace who and when and where a firearm is going such should be implemented on a federal level. \n\n When and where a firearm is going?Do you really believe that horse sh##!\n In other words if I go up in the hills shooting you think I should fill out forms stating what I'm doing what I'm shooting how much I'm shooting not to forget\n where I'm shooting and what time I'm due home?I DON'T think so along with millions upon millions of others. \n \n \nI also believe that no one should be able to purchase automatic rifles period... There is no need for a civilian to have such a deadly piece of equipment, let alone have it not knowing how to use it.\n\n Remember?law 1936 concerning auotmatic weapons\n \n \nSure you say guns don't kill people but people kill people, but the gun is only a tool or a means to that end. Limit the tools to take a human life and you may end up saving a few in the long run....\n\n People do kill people the gun don't just decide its going to kill today.And as long as were limiting tools that could take a human life, how do you feel about walking and not driving?and yes mr. jj I'm dragging that one out.In fact there\n are so many things out there with potential to kill if we \"limited\"them we would be set back to say the dark ages?hell even then they had swords(sword control?):xbanghead",
