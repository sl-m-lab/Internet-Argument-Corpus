Phone transcripts show Enron searching for reasons to shut down one of its power plants during the height of the California energy crisis, eventually closing the plant as blackouts rippled across the state.\n\n Read more: Enron's early gaming / Transcripts reveal manipulation started in 1998\n \n Or the bailing out of Goldman Sachs.

   "Clinton left us with an economic surplus, which the feckless Bush soon blew away in his stupid warfare against Iraq.\n\n \n Just a quick comment on Slick's great economy before going back to the OP. Clinton's \"surplus\" was the result of a few things. \n 1. A Republican Congress that forced him to sign a balanced budget.\n 2. A false Dot Com bubble that bursted just after he left office.\n 3. Increased housing sales/second mortgages as a result of cheap money and reduced qualification requirements.\n \n Now, to the OP:\n Saying that California's energy industry was deregulated is a joke. Retail electricity costs were fixed at an artificially low rate. Energy traders were unregulated and could sell electricity wholesale at much higher rates than they could to consumers, so that's what they did. A lot of California electricity was sold out-of-state because they could get a higher rate for the electricity. Add to that the Clean Air Act and the fact that, because of changing regulations, no new plants were built in the 90's. And since California energy producers could make more money selling electricity out of state, California was forced to import electricity from Oregon and Washington at substantially higher rates.\n In FERC's report, it stated:\n \n\n - Staff concludes that supply-demand imbalance, flawed market design and\n inconsistent rules made possible significant market manipulation as delineated in final investigation report. Without underlying market dysfunction, attempts to manipulate the market would not be successful.\n http://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/wec/enron/summary-findings.pdf \n",
