Stalin's reasoning for locking up and killing tens of millions of his own people had absolutely nothing to do with war. It was to maintain power. He was a ruthless dictator who realized that the more of his own people he killed, the easier everyone was to keep in submission. It's that simple.\n \n As Charliegone has pointed out multiple times, both left-wing and right-wing governments almost always end up committing abhorrent atrocities in the name of power maintenance.

After that the Emperor was deposed of with support of the US. The acts of the North Vietnamese (such as executing \"class enemies\") caused many to flee south. Of course the South wasn't innocent with it's president imprisoning those who were \"accused\" of being communists. Unfortunately this would all lead to war and lead to US involvement when the South had coup, with North taking advantage and escalating it even further. In the end neither government was good, but for you to some how suggest that the North was \"trying\" to liberate people is way too wishful. The realities are that both the North and South did some pretty despicable things.\n\n \n If the North Vietnamese were so evil as you portray them why didn't the people use the war (which was destroying much of the country) to overthrow\n the government. Instead the people rallied around their government to expel the invaders. You also forget that the communist were poised to win the elections that the U.S. prevented from taking place because the elections would have unified the whole Vietnam under one government. So much for our dedication to democracy. It wasn't the Chinese and Russians that started the whole thing. It was the French with their old world colonialism and then the Americans with their imperialism and savagery.\n \n Where in history did the communist ever destroy democracy? In Cuba Castro did not destroy democracy, he destroyed a hateful gangster police state (Batista) controlled by Washington. In China before the communists took power there was no democracy, only fascism and Japanese colonialism. In Vietnam they didn't get rid of democracy, they got rid of French colonialism and American domination. In Nicaragua the communist got rid of a hateful Somoza dynasty/dictatorship controlled by the USA. In Chile President Allende honored the constitution; it was Pinochet the dictator who destroyed the democracy. In Russia Lenin did not destroy democracy. There was none under Czarism and Kerensky.",

   "You are a right-wing fanatic. Vietnam was a colony of the French. The U.S.A. aided the French in reconquering Vietnam after WW II by giving France aid (i.e. money, military equipment and intelligence). The French imperialists were defeated at Dien Bien Phu. Then comes in Uncle Sam and says, \"Forget the fact that we helped the French reconquer you and make you into their colony again; we're here to promote democracy now.\" Even their puppet Diem was murdered by the Americans because he was such an embarassment.

Tell me son, did your mommy tell you that the government was so evil? \n Or was it the streets? Were you thrown out by apathetic people? Did the streets raise you? Were they nurturing? Loving? Kind? Compassionate? Did they teach you that if it wasn't for the government you'd have a nice bed to sleep on? \n Or maybe it was a communist? A Vietkong? LSD was popular among the hippies, was it? Tell me, who told you that the Americans killed that guy? Was it a hippie? A communist? Was it the LSD that told you that? \n If government are so evil, then why not destroy them? It's what you want, as you've stated. Tell me, comrade, would you enjoy living in an \"every-man-for-himself\" world. Would it be nice to live in a place where heights of disorganization render progress impossible? Would you be content to live in a world where a ban on stealing would destroy the economy? For that matter, would it be possible to issue a ban on stealing? \n If you hate democracy so much, why don't you let King Obama I make your decisions for you? Tell me, if the US is so evil, then why do you live here? Would you be happier working in a Chinese factory? A \"volunteer labor\" camp in Siberia? Would you want to hold a job in North Korea? If communism is so good...\n Would you want to hold a job in the communist Paradise of North Vietnam? Can you prove to me that we intentionally kept the communists from winning the elections? If so, that's pretty sad. I'm pretty disappointed that my evil rotten government (that you want to provide your healthcare and educational benefits, by the way) has failed to reduce my wages to 2\u00a2 an hour. \n What a savage my friend is for trying to aide that guy who was getting mugged in an alley. I called him back and scolded him for trying to stop that poor innocent mugger. I gave him an apology. Two seconds later I was punched in the face and my friend tried to defend me. I got angry at him and am now screaming for him to leave that mugger who is currently trying to attack me alone. If my friend lets go, that mugger will give up. Life really is just like a Brinks home security commercial, where the attacker kicks your door in, but pees himself and feels when he hears a burglar alarm that makes no more noise than he did when he kicked the door in.

   "\n Where in history did the communist ever destroy democracy?\n\n \n Tsk tsk tsk. Did you forget North Korea so quickly?\n \n \nIn Cuba Castro did not destroy democracy, he destroyed a hateful gangster police state (Batista) controlled by Washington.\n\n \n Do you have any way of getting info? How one could conclude that Cuba is a democracy just boggles my mind.\n \n Fidel Castro is the worst violator of human rights in the Third World today.The Cuban dictatorship has curtailed the republic's free press and banned strikes. Critics and opponents of the government, including journalists, human rights activists and members of opposition political parties, are arrested and some are convicted and imprisoned. Fidel Castro claims that demonstrations against him are led &#8220;subversives&#8221; and people under the influence of the United States.\n \n Didn't you know that the photographer Cristobal Herrera Ulashkevich was forced to leave Cuba? Why? Because he captured two crucial images of Castro's health slide:his fainting spell while making a speech in 2001 and his dramatic fall another speech in October 2004.Cristobal Herrera once said, &#8220;I am condemned to forced exile. The Cuban government barred me from returning to my country,without explanations.We had no other option left.This is the price for doing photojournalist in Cuba&#8221;.\n \n The Cuban dictatorship have destroyed traditional Cuban society, culture,and systems, in an attempt to build a communist society.\n \n For another thing, Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was the best ally of Mengistu Haile Mariam,who was dictator of Ethiopia from 1974 to 1991. During this period of time, Fidel Castro Ruz sent 4000 soldiers to Ethiopia. Thousands of people were killed by Cuban soldiers, many of them reportedly extra judicially executed when unarmed or after having been captured.\n \n Weren't you aware that the per capita on the island isn't even US$ 1,560, making it one of the poorest areas on Earth?\n \n Weren't you informed that one of the Cuba's longest-serving political prisoners, Francisco Chaviano, who was chairman of the Cuban Civil Rights, was released in August 2007? He said: &#8220;I spent five years stuck in a cell without seeing the sun, two years without receiving visitors and four years without conjugal visits&#8221;.Since then he has continued to criticise the Cuban dictatorship, risking imprisonment and even death.\n \n Comrade, you've made me feel naive; I've never seen this level of ignorance before!\n \n \nIn China before the communists took power there was no democracy, only fascism and Japanese colonialism.\n\n \n Yeah, 2\u00a2 an hour is OK, isn't it? \n \n \nIn Vietnam they didn't get rid of democracy, they got rid of French colonialism and American domination.\n\n \n Let's give that guy a Klondike bar! Better yet, let's give him an award for his fair leadership!\n \n \nIn Nicaragua the communist got rid of a hateful Somoza dynasty/dictatorship controlled by the USA. In Chile President Allende honored the constitution; it was Pinochet the dictator who destroyed the democracy.\n\n \n Once again, this boggles my mind how you can blatantly ignore the massive violations of human rights these people commit.\n \n \nIn Russia Lenin did not destroy democracy. There was none under Czarism and Kerensky.\n\n \n Stalin did, though he was just the guy they needed for WWII. Obama would've handed Russia to the Axis on a Silver Platter. And you would've supported that decision.",

He did NOTHING wrong, but to these so called revolutionaries basically being a business owner was enough to put a death warrant on his head. Luckily he was given asylum to the USA and he left everything he had worked hard to earn. Other people in my family were not so lucky. Some who had sympathized with the communists but later changed their minds because they saw truly what these \"revolutionaries\" truly stood for were tortured and killed. At least in the USA you can express your opinion and not be shot or tortured. At least here you don't have to worry about your life being hell because some guy things all business owners are evil in some way.

   "You say I'm an elitist and lunatic, probably suggesting the USA is even, but the fact remains, these so called \"Communist Revolutions\" were nothing more but power grabs by extremists to control the population. My grandfather was a business owner in El Salvador. He wasn't born into privilege or anything, he worked hard to earn what he had. He had a total of 3 business all of which he personally strived to make bigger. When the so called \"revolution\" began his name was added to the long lists of people who had any tie with the government (my grandfather owned a driving school who provided certain services to the people.) He was constantly harassed to do as they say or else. It came the point where he began receiving death threats and finally a price on his head. What did he do wrong? He did NOTHING wrong, but to these so called revolutionaries basically being a business owner was enough to put a death warrant on his head. Luckily he was given asylum to the USA and he left everything he had worked hard to earn. Other people in my family were not so lucky. Some who had sympathized with the communists but later changed their minds because they saw truly what these \"revolutionaries\" truly stood for were tortured and killed. At least in the USA you can express your opinion and not be shot or tortured. At least here you don't have to worry about your life being hell because some guy things all business owners are evil in some way. Maybe Marx did not intend for communism to do this, but the ideas he portrayed simply made it easier for people like Lenin, Stalin, Castro and Pol Pot to gain control and ruin the lives of people.\n\n \n So what is underlying your logic? That the left should turn over and die because your slave-driving grandfather was forced out of the country by the guerrillas?\n \n Question: How many Americans were driven into exile in the Revolutionary period 1776-1783? \n \n Answer: Out of a population of 4 million whites 100,000 left for Cananda, England, and the West Indies. They went abroad bearing tales of the godless, barbaric revolutionaries who confiscated their property, tar and feathered and murdered their kinsmen. Those\n who remained and refused to take an oath of allegiance to the new state governments were denied virtually all civil liberties. After the American Civil War, thousands more fled to South America and other points, again disturbed by the social upheaval. How much more is such an exodus to be expected following the Cuban Revolution? -- a true social revolution, giving rise to changes much more profound than anything in the American experience. How many more would have left the United States if 90 miles away lay the world's wealthiest nation welcoming their residence and promising all manner of benefits and rewards? How much more has Cuba the right to punish its traitors who are collaborating with the empire 90 miles away? \n \n Why Socialism?

   "\n \n So? A non-Catholic pope is perfectly plausible, but that's another matter. It's easy for leaders to control a group of people who practice one form of government even though the leader himself may not believe in that form of government. If I were a king, I would get up every day and shake my head at the ludicrousness of feudalism even if everyone beneath me strolled about their day praising the system. I'd say that religious figures pull that stunt just as much as if not more than leaders of government.\n\n \n In case you didn't know feudalism kept the powers of the king in check. The King intention in every feudal country was to centralise control of the country under the King and away from the feudal lords. This is what happened in Spain, France and England eventually.",
