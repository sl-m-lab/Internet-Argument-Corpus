The teachings of Jesus are sadly missing from churches today. Sadly many churches are pushing people away with their back biting, mean spirit, clickish attitudes, intolerance, and non welcoming atmosphears.\n \n \n There are only two things that are at the basis of all of Jesus's teaching. Love the Lord thy God with all your heart, mind, and soul and love your neighbor as yourself. Any chruch who does not preach these 2 concepts has left the path.",
