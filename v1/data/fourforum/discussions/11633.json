   "Look at those Brink's Home Security Commercials; making a person feel insecure sure is a good way to advertise, isn't it? But the question is, is it realistic? Will a criminal just kick your door in, but soil himself and flee in terror because of a burglar alarm? Or would a gun be more likely to have this effect? \n \n One common argument in favor of the burglar alarm is \"The police will protect you!\". But if you believe this, then do some research. Nobody in the US has the right to police protection. If you disagree, then I suggest you do some homework; look all you wan't, you'll never find a right to police protection. In other words, the police have no obligation to jump out of their desks and magically teleport to your house; they'll show up whenever they're good and ready. This is to ensure that the police are protected from lawsuits. So unless you have something to protect yourself with, a burglar alarm is useless. It will help you very little.\n \n On the other hand, a gun is ten times more likely to scare off an intruder than a burglar alarm. The police will probably take too much time to arrive at your house because they're too lazy to magically teleport; and by the time they take their merry old time to show up, the intruder will probably be long gone, and most home invaders understand this. If criminals were really afraid of burglar alarms, do you think they'd invade the home of anyone who looks like they can afford a cheap security system? A burglar alarm alone is useless for stopping a criminal; life isn't like Brinks commercials. A gun will actually help.",

   "No criminal that wants inside your home bad enough to come busting through your front door, will ever be terrified and made to flee at the sound of a burglar alarm. The sound of the front door coming off its hinges is loud enough to alert anybody nearby, so's the sound of breaking glass, they don't seem to care one bit.\n \n What are the similarities of a gun and a burglar alarm? Upon detection of a threat both will make a loud noise, that's where the similarities end. What separates them is that the gun will not only make a loud noise, it'll induce intolerable pain and internal damage to the burglar and properly incapacitate them.",

   "We should me more considerate about the feelings of the anti-gun people. I am willing to take the first step, I will get me some of those gun-free zone signs and put them up all over my yard, then I will get rid of all my guns tomorrow and get me a burglar alarm, then when a criminal breaks into my home and the alarm goes off, and the criminal keeps coming, I will throw the alarm keypad at him, that should send him running, dont yall agree, if that doesnt work I can get a bullet that belonged to the guns I had, and throw a bullet at him, surely now he will turn and run. I am so glad I listened to the anti-gun folks and got rid of my guns, I truly feel safer now. By the way, Have any of you anti-gun people ever got the square peg to fit into the round hole, or are yall still working on it.:xcensored",

   "I almost hate to get into this discussion, but here goes...\n \n Guess what...you are both partially correct. Home alarms are one of many tools that can be employed to secure a home. As a police officer, I highly recommend that anyone have an alarm, with a LOUD audible siren, particularly if you live in a residential neighborhood. While this does act as a deterrent to burglary in some cases, it is less effective in others. This is because criminals also know that it will take some period of time before anyone arrives as a result of the alarm being triggered. Most alarm monitoring companies place at least one call to the residence, if not more, to verify that the alarm is legitimate, prior to dispatching assistance.\n \n I have worked many calls in which an alarm was sufficient to ward off an attempt to enter a home. I have also worked many calls in which the alarm had little or no effect, whether the home was occupied or not. Just as an alarm is not the ultimate guarantee against unlawful entry, neither is simply having a gun. Both are tools that we use to try to make our homes and families safe. \n \n With all that being said...If a home invasion is not prevented by an alarm, there is a period of time in which you will be on your own until some form of help arrives. I do not know what response time for alarm monitoring companies in this area is, but my departments average response time last year was 9.2 minutes. That is a long time to be without help if you have no means of protecting yourself. A multi-tier system is typically the best way to help insure the safety of our loved ones, with things such as outdoor lighting, alarms, a dog that barks at strangers being the first tier, second tier tools include knowing what areas of your home are easiest to defend yourself and your family from, having a plan that all members of the family are aware of, and executing that plan. Lethal force is the final tier of home and family defense, not because it is least important, but because it is the least desirable to have to employ. Serious legal ramifications can exist even if you are legally justified in use of force. \n \n Simply having a firearm available is not enough either. Training is a HUGE benefit when it comes to defending your home or family. Simply having a gun is not useless, but it is far from the ultimate protection. Having a gun AND having a sufficient level of training increases the odds of surviving a violent encounter by large magnitudes. By ignoring ANY means of protecting your home and family, I think you have seriously undermined your goal of protection. I would not say that everyone should have a gun, yet I do think that everyone should consider the possibility that a firearm coupled with appropriate training can and has been the difference between life and death. \n \n Even though some states allow for the use of a firearm in defense of property, I am of mixed feelings on such laws. My personal opinion is that no material possessions are worth killing for, but at the same time, if someone were to attempt to steal firearms or other items that could be used to endanger others down the road, a moral contradiction exists. As a general rule, I recommend that people not endanger themselves or their families by confronting criminals. Instead, try to be a good witness, get accurate descriptions, ect. Let those of us that have chosen to confront the criminal element of society do it for you. Not only are we better prepared and equipped to do so, but if something were to happen to you, the information you have will be lost to us. And I am sure that your family would prefer that you joined them for breakfast in the morning. Resisting with lethal force, has it's place and I do not discourage anyone from protecting themselves or their family, but be smart about it. Use lethal force as a LAST RESORT and do everything that you can to avoid it. Then, when the time comes that it is required, act decisively, aggressively and explosively!!\n \n \n Justin",

A burglar alarm might give an unarmed resident the warning needed to escape/flee or hide. Also, a burglar alarm notifies you and authorities of a break in when your not there. \n If money is a factor (as it is for many) a loud dog may be a viable option. Inexpensive if adopted from the pound and dog food will cost about the same as monthly monitoring fees (depending on the dog). But if your dog is like mine don't expect him to stop the intruder. My dog will bark and let me know if someone is there but if I'm not home he'll bark and then show the intruder where the good stuff is.\n I think a burglar alarm is an especially good idea for those who can't own a gun by law or refuse to own one for personnal reasons (the latter I don't understand but it's their choice).\n \n God Bless",
