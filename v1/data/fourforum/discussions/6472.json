   "Here Come the Liberal Fundamentalists!\n \n Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines, that seeks to elevate the ways and \"wisdom\" of man above the wisdom and desires of God. It's principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are \"revisited\" through suspect liberal \"scholarship\" or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of today's liberal elitists.\n \n The genesis of today's liberal fundamentalists were the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and \"free-love\", illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat, and tears and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt. \n \n Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice were foreign concepts to them. \"Right and wrong\", \"good and evil\" were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than it \"feels good, so let's do it.\" The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their carnal minds was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values.\n \n One of the most revered mantras of the liberal fundamentalists is \"equality\". The net effect of this experiment was to elevate women via the degradation of men; promote racial equality by instituting race-based preferences and reverse-discrimination; engender class warfare against people of means via the redistribution of wealth (a concept centered in greed for other people's money, rather than rely on one's own personal initiative and work ethic); and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, and other corrupt lifestyles) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal \"tolerance.\" However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a corrupted partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant.\" \n \n Rather than truly embrace \"freedom\", liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses which are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUV's, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools, embrace a de-facto litmus test against possible pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, seek to squelch religious speech via \"hate-speech\" laws (note Canada today), and generally engage in a whole range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values.\n \n Liberal fundamentalism undermines the basic effectiveness of the government, legislatures, and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence.",

   "What have the liberals done to America?\n \n Traditional Americanism speaks of and endorses principles such as truth, honesty, integrity, character, and virtue; love for country, commitment to family, and dedication to God. On these great principles America the Great, one nation under God, was founded. And only on these principles and the strength of God can we hope to stand, now and in the future. Yet even today, these great foundations of wisdom are crumbling beneath us. The violent and decadent society that the liberals so despise is the very one they have created. As one Orlando Sentinel columnist noted, \"They wanted sexual promiscuity, drugs, disregard for the law, no censorship of pornography, no laws against sodomy or public profanity, abortion on demand, quick and easy divorces, acceptance of homosexuality, a welfare system that paid women to have illegitimate children, a tax system that penalizes marriage, and a godless education system that utilizes metal detectors and drug-sniffing dogs in our public schools. And they got it. Every last bit of it.\" ",

   "Those darn liberal heathens! emoticon_mad \n \n \n Does merely believing Jesus is the son of God mean you'll go to Heaven? Of course not. If Adolf Hitler believed Jesus is the son of God, does that mean he's in Heaven notwithstanding all the American soldiers he killed? Of course not. If Lee Harvey Oswald believed Jesus is the son of God, does that mean he's in Heaven despite all the prostitutes he hired? Of course not. If O.J. Simpson believes Jesus is the son of God, does that mean he's going to Heaven even though he married a white woman? Of course not. \n The vast majority of those claiming they are Christian today don't have a clue. They don't have a Christian bone in their bodies. They claim they know God loves them because they saw a banner at a college football game that said \"John 3:16.\" Well, let me tell you something, friends and true believers, there are a heck of a lot more Bible verses than John 3:16. \n \n I've pointed out to some of these liberal Gore lovers that God has historically hated sinners and frequently condemned them to painful deaths. For instance, as a lesson to those who have the audacity to show physical love for the same gender, God incinerated the genitals, mouths and every other orifice involved in such sexual practices in the towns of Sodom and Gomorra (Genesis 19:24-25). As a lesson to those who are fat and sloppy, God struck a town of gluttons with a vicious plague which made that last drumstick taste none-too-good and wiped out every living person (Numbers 11:33-34). As a lesson to youngsters who fail to be seen and not heard, God sent a bear to maul to death a couple dozen children who had teased a bald man (2 Kings 2:23-24). And during one particularly bad mood, God threw the lessons out the window and killed every man, woman, child and infant on the planet (except Noah's family) with a Great Flood (Genesis 7:23). It's a good thing these John 3:16 liberals weren't living then. \n \n God didn't do all the slaughtering and mangling on his own. His chosen people, the Israelites, served as his assassins on more than one occasion. God told the Israelites to kill all the men and rape the women and children in the towns they invaded (Deuteronomy 20:13-16). God told the Israelites to take any child who dared to disobey his parents to the town square and hurl stones at his body and head until the tot's corpse was lifeless (Deuteronomy 21:18-21). God takes took no prisoners. \n \n When I cite these Biblical passages, do you know what these modern day immoral pseudo-Christians have the audacity to say? \"Jesus took all that away.\" That is utter blasphemy, my friends! The very idea that the words of the Son somehow trump the words of his Father is nonsensical on its face. Do you think a Father who had spent so much time talking about killing disobedient children would allow His own upstart Son to tell folks to ignore everything His Daddy had ever said? I don't think so. If Jesus had even tried to do this, God would have yanked Him back to Heaven and given Him a good whupping with a rod. Jesus, Himself, admitted that he is subordinate to the Father who rules over Him (1 Corinthians 11:3). Jesus told the apostles that He had not come to destroy the law of the prophets of old, rather, He had come to fulfill that law (Matthew 5:17). Jesus approved of his Father's command that children who curse their parents are to be put to death (Matthew 15:3-4). Jesus chastised the Pharisees for failing to kill those children who defied their parents' commands (Mark 7:9-13). Jesus told us we are to live our lives in fear of God for God has the power not only to kill us, but to torture us forever in Hell (Luke 12:5). Jesus never contradicted his Father's word, and anyone who suggests otherwise is going straight to Hell. \n \n The smell of blood and roasted corpses was not just pleasing to God, who especially enjoyed the aroma after the Great Flood (Genesis 8:21), it was enjoyed by Jesus as well. Jesus certainly wasn't averse to malicious, virulent punishments to those who didn't accept His every word as Gospel. To name but a few, Jesus told the disciples to bring before Him any man who didn't believe in Him, and to violently slaughter the non-believer while Jesus watched (Luke 19:27). Jesus killed one man by having his body eaten by a swarm of worms because the man failed to give Jesus His due (Acts 12:23). Jesus struck a Jew blind for thwarting His teachings (Acts 13:8-11). He struck a man dumb for failing to listen well (Luke 1:20). He took the lives of a husband and wife by scaring them to death for not forking over all the money they made on a real estate transaction (Acts 5:1-10). During one particularly temperamental time when Jesus was hungry, He even killed a fig tree for failing to bear figs, even though Jesus knew figs weren't in season (Mark 11:12-14). Jesus means business! \n \n Recognizing that He had neither the time nor wherewithal to torture and maim all of the countless sinners of the world, Jesus ordered us to torture ourselves by chopping off any body parts that are engaged in sin. Those who practice sexual self-gratification are to chop off their arms. Those who have sexual thoughts for people other than their spouses are to gouge out their eyes (Mark 9:43-47). The wrath of Jesus is no less than the wrath of the Father. \n \n But the clearest proof of the Son's wrath are his promises to inflict unconscionable pain and suffering on those who decline to follow His and His Father's word. Jesus said sinners cannot enter Heaven. All sinners, most notably, those who engage in premarital sex will be forever estranged from God. \"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:9-10).\" \n \n And what happens to sinners since they cannot enter Heaven? Come Judgment Day, they shall be gathered together and hurled into a furnace of fire where there will be uncontrollable wailing and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 13:41-42, 50). Entire cities of people who don't believe will suffer a fate worse than that of Sodom and Gomorra (Mark 6:11). Jesus told us that God, who we already knew is subject to violent episodes, will take \"vengeance on them that know not God\" by burning them forever \"in flaming fire\" (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). \n \n The brutality and destruction will not be entirely blase, though. There will be great sparks of creativity. Come Judgment Day, the Lord will create horse-like locusts will human heads, women's hair, lion's teeth and scorpion's tails which will sting and inflict savage pain on sinners for five months (Revelation 9:7-10). As a result of the fires, plagues and beasts He inspires, the world will be covered in unburied dead bodies, rotting everywhere, while good Christians, like those at Landover, will \"rejoice over them and make merry, and shall send gifts to one another\" (Revelation 11:5-10). Meanwhile, the smoke of the burning, rotting bodies will ascend and plague the Earth forever (Revelation 14:10-11). And the smell will attract scavenger birds who will feast upon \"the supper of the great God\" (Revelation 19:17-18). \n \n As Roosevelt did to Nagasaki, Jesus will use every weapon at His disposal to torture sinners. He will send an earthquake to kill 7,000 people (Revelation 11:13). And to add just a bit more drama, He will exercise his wrath by inflicting bodily sores, turning the seas and rivers to blood, scorching everyone with fire, causing people to consume their own tongues in pain, and causing horrendous storms which will strike dead the now speechless (though sated) sinners (Revelation 16:1-21). \n \n All of these descriptions of the rapture, friends, every last one of them, comes straight from the New Testament. And we know that every single word of the New Testament was inspired by Jesus, Himself. Is Jesus Mr. Lovey-Dovey-turn the other cheek-Goodie-Two-Shoes, like all these demonic liberals would have us believe? Not at all. Countless New Testament passages show Jesus was as vengeful, angry and violent as his Father, perhaps more so. Of course, if you ignore these thousands of Bible passages and just focus on the one -- John 3:16 -- you can live in a fantasy world believing you are going to Heaven even though 587 other verses say you'll burn for eternity in Hell. Like the ostrich, these John 3:16 liberals stick their heads in the sand, refusing to accept the remainder of the New Testament. Well, I have news for them. That sand won't protect them from the giant flames which will one day engulf their bodies -- flames sent by each member of the Holy Trinity, Jesus included. I wonder how persuasive their recitation of John 3:16 will be as the skin burns off their bones? \n \n Pastor Harry Hardwick\n Landover Baptist\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

   "Doggone it, Jo, and Jesus Christ was liberal, too.\n\n \n Jesus a liberal? ROTFLOL! And don't confuse political conservatism / liberalism with Biblical conservatism / liberalism. As God, Jesus is the one who gave Moses the Levitical law against gay sex to begin with; and he's the one who inspires all Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16), including Romans 1:26-27 and I Corinthians 6:9-10. He's the one who knits together babies in their mother's wombs (Psalm 139:13) that you liberals love to butcher. He's the one who said to the adulteress, \"Go and sin no more'. Liberals often say there is no sin, and they'll do whoever they want, any way they want, whenever they want, and will do them with pride. Jesus is the one who says a man shall reap what he sows, as opposed to the liberals' greedy \"redistribution of wealth\" scheme, which says that people should reap for a living what other people sow. And Jesus is the one in the Book of Revelation who judges wicked sinners and sends them to the Lake of Fire. Liberals would never cast judgments, unless they're talking to a conservative, and then they turn into Mr. Judgmental themselves. And if liberals could recognize evil at all they'd either show tolerance towards it, endlessly debate it at the U.N., or appease it until the cows came home. Jesus a liberal? Get real.\n \n \n Good thing that Christ isn't here in the flesh these days. EZ would be the first to nail him to the cross.\n\n \n More inane, liberal prattle.....\n \n <flush<\n \n \n More than half the population of the US is thankful for the liberals in the 20th Century for giving \"Men\" the liberal interpretation of \"mankind\".\n\n \n A gross overestimate of pro-liberal sentiment, IMO. Liberals are a minority today, and probably getting smaller. With the advent of cable News, the libs can't lie and spin their liberal fairy tales any more without getting called on the carpet (ala Dan Rather, et al). They're being exposed and it's about time!",

Yes, I've heard it preached. But let's look at it in context (which you conveniently left out):\n \n The Rich Young Man  \n \n Mark 10:17 As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. \"Good teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" 18\" Why do you call me good?\" Jesus answered. \"No one is good-except God alone. 19 You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.'\" 20 \"Teacher,\" he declared, \"all these I have kept since I was a boy.\" 21 Jesus looked at him and loved him. \"One thing you lack,\" he said. \"Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" 22 At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth. 23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\" (end)\n \n The story is that of a rich young man who thought that he was keeping all of God's commandments (as if anyone ever has) and still wanted to know what to do to inherit eternal life. Reading between the lines, it can be argued on firm ground that, contrary to the man's assertion that he has kept all of God's laws, he was instead breaking the first Commandment: \"You shall have no other Gods before Me.\" Sensing the mans idol worship of money over God (which later becomes apparent when the rich man walked away sad), Jesus thus told him to, \"Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" The man's sin and idol of mammon were exposed. \n \n It's a good lesson for those who value money over God, and it puts things in their proper perspective. But throughout the Bible there have been men greatly blessed BY GOD with possessions (Job, Abraham, Jacob, Solomon, etc.). So my questions back to you are:\n \n 1. Should you then give away all that God has given you if it's not an idol? If God is first and your money just goes for living expenses, helping the poor, and a tad of entertainment, where is the sin?\n \n 2. If your debt outweighs your possessions, do you ask the church to bail you out? Give the poor your debt too?\n \n 2. How many in your liberal congregation have sold everything they have and given it to the poor. Have you?",

On these great principles America the Great, one nation under God, was founded. And only on these principles and the strength of God can we hope to stand, now and in the future. Yet even today, these great foundations of wisdom are crumbling beneath us. The violent and decadent society that the liberals so despise is the very one they have created. As one Orlando Sentinel columnist noted, \"They wanted sexual promiscuity, drugs, disregard for the law, no censorship of pornography, no laws against sodomy or public profanity, abortion on demand, quick and easy divorces, acceptance of homosexuality, a welfare system that paid women to have illegitimate children, a tax system that penalizes marriage, and a godless education system that utilizes metal detectors and drug-sniffing dogs in our public schools.

Big deal. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n I doubt if very many people here are expecting Christians to do that. I certainly am not. That said, I'm sure that you've encountered, either here or 'in the flesh', conservative/fundamentalist Christians who profess the Bible to be God's literal, inerrant word. Their logic, as best I can tell, goes something like this: if the Bible contains even one error or contradiction, then the 'truth' of the entire Bible becomes suspect. \n \n Defending biblical inerrancy is not an enviable position to take, at least in my opinion. In fact, it's an impossible goal. You've already been presented with Matthew/Luke's differing dates as to Jesus' birth. A similar problem exists with the genealogy of Jesus as given to us by Matthew/Luke. The two genealogies cannot be reconciled. Everyone understands this. The 'solution' offered to us by inventive apologists is that while Matthew traces Jesus' genealogy through Joseph, Luke traces it through Mary.

I think you get the idea. \n \n Does this mean that we should therefore \"throw out the baby with the bathwater\"? Not in my opinion.

The church didn't let the masses read the Bible for centuries (in fact most people couldn't read anyway). Why would they need to edit it?

We rely instead on alleged quotations of Jesus put to paper decades after the fact by individuals who were almost certainly not eyewitnesses to Jesus' ministry. Furthermore, we can discern an evolution of Christology from Paul through Mark, Matthew and Luke, to the gospel of John. For example, as you read through Paul and the gospels, ask yourself the following question: when did Jesus become divine? You will be presented with four different answers. John's gospel (written circa 100 CE) contains long, rambling discources attributed to Jesus which are mostly absent from the other gospels. What's the probability that Jesus actually said all of that stuff contained in John, a gospel written approx. 70 years after Jesus' death? Do you see the problem?\n \n My personal opinion is that there exists buried within the gospels the core teachings of Jesus mixed in with a lot of stuff attributed to Jesus which he probably never said.

   "Johnhanks:\n \n \nWhy, then, does the christian bible include these other books at all, if they have been superceded by the words of Jesus? Why do you not simply excise the whole of the Old Testament from your scripture?\nJesus often referred to the \"law\" or the \"commandments\". The words and phrases he used were those of the Jewish tradition. It would be like trying to understand Otto Rank or Alfred Adler and not referring to Sigmund Freud. Not they totally agreed, but that the terminology and texture of the discourse was similar. Moses' understandings were the basis for much of Jesus understandings, however, it is very obvious that Jesus thought the Moses' teachings were at minimum were incomplete:\n \n Mt:5:17: Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. \n \n Note that the word translated as \"destroy\" also translates as \"undermine\" and the word translated as \"fulfill\" also translates as \"complete\". So Jesus is saying, I have not come to undermine the law or the prophets, but to complete them.\n \n If one is to be a christian then one must accept that the previous laws and teachings were not \"wrong\", simply incomplete. In order to complete something you need to add the new to the old. That is why I refer to the Torah as well as Jesus' teachings. \n \n Jesus makes it clear that he Is flowing in the tradition of Moses when he places himself in the tradition of Moses:\n \n Jn:12:49: For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.\n \n This is reminiscent of Moses at the feet of the Burning Bush in Exodus.\n \n Jesus then gives his own commandments. They are different than Moses. He stakes out new and different territory.\n \n Mk:12:29: And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:\n \n Mk:12:30: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.\n \n Mk:12:31: And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.\n \n Then Jesus exhorts his followers to follow his commandments, not those of Exodus. He completes the old law and establishes the new one\n \n Jn:13:34: A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.\n \n Jn:14:15: If ye love me, keep my commandments.\n \n This is why I take the position that a Christian must view the old law and prophets through the lens of the teachings of Jesus. Biblicans do not do that. They regard the old law as complete whereas Jesus says it is not complete. A Biblican regards the old law to be fulfilled and possessing the same wholeness as the teachings of Jesus. That is in direct opposition to Jesus' words and teachings.\n \n If you care to understand what I am saying to a greater degree, try to justify war citing only the words of Jesus. It is impossible without verbal and logical gymnastics. Biblicans will justify war as \"christian\" even though it is completely contradictory to the teachings of Jesus, by citing passages from the Old Testament.",

They regard the old law as complete whereas Jesus says it is not complete. A Biblican regards the old law to be fulfilled and possessing the same wholeness as the teachings of Jesus. That is in direct opposition to Jesus' words and teachings.\n\n \n I believe Jesus said he came to fulfill the law. As for the moral law of God (r.e. on adultery, murder, etc.) we still abide by those.\n \n \nIf you care to understand what I am saying to a greater degree, try to justify war citing only the words of Jesus. It is impossible without verbal and logical gymnastics. Biblicans will justify war as \"christian\" even though it is completely contradictory to the teachings of Jesus, by citing passages from the Old Testament.\n\n \n The notion that being a follower of Jesus Christ is synonymous with always favoring world peace is a common one, bolstered by the pacifist positions of many denominational leaders around the world. It stems from biblical roots, primarily the oft-mistranslated commandment \"Thou shalt not kill,\" Jesus' command to love one's enemies and his admonishment of Peter in Gethsemane. \n \n The first problem is that these divine directives apply to individuals, not nations - the Bible distinguishes clearly between the two in both the Old and New Testaments. Indeed, while salvation may be claimed by the individual, the soulless nations remain under the sway of the prince of this world who once offered them, without success, to Jesus. Thus, these commands cannot apply to a nation-state. It would also be highly illogical to assert that a nation which prides itself on the separation of church and state should be somehow subject to the same Christian morality which it may not impose on its citizens. \n \n It is important to understand that the peace of which the Bible speaks is not the peace for which the world is protesting. Christian peace is a fruit of the Spirit, it is the harmony of individuals, not nations. The blessed peacemakers who will be called sons of God are not riotous leftists protesting war in San Francisco, but those loving souls who make peace between individuals.\n \n Jesus' own words on war are scanty, yet surprisingly practical. \"Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Will he not sit down first and consider whether he is able with 10,000 men to oppose the one coming against him with 20,000? If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.\" On another occasion, He tells his disciples \"if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.\" \n \n Hardly Clausewitz, true, but neither are they the words of one intrinsically opposed to self-defense, on an individual or national basis. Indeed, Revelation 19:15 prophesies that Jesus will make war on the nations Himself one day. (Wolrdnetdaily.org)\n \n Finally, \"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's (including defending your country in war) and render unto God the things that are God's.\"",

It is not however a Christian view.\n \n \nJesus' own words on war are scanty,\nNo question about that, however, Jesus' words about peace are plentiful and need no interpreter. \n \n Mt 5:9: Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\n \n Mt 5:43: Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. 44: But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 45: That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\n \n Lk:6:29: And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also.\n \n And on and on \"Love thy neighbor...\" \"Love one another...\" His message is very clear and it in no way condones violence of any kind against any one.\n \n \nFinally, \"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's (including defending your country in war) and render unto God the things that are God's.\"\nDon't you think it a bit over the top to put words in Jesus' mouth?

No question that Jesus says what you quote, but then when they bring the two words out, Jesus says, \"That's enough\" (an appropriate translation) and then he goes up to pray. He comes back to warn the Apostles not to fall into temptation, but temptation with regard to what? With regard to stooping to violence. \n \n Lk:22;37: For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end. 38: And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. 39: And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. 40: And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. 41: And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, 42: Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. 43: And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. 44: And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. 45: And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, 46: And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.\n \n Then read the rest of the story. When one of his followers stoops to violence and cuts off the ear of the High Priest's servant Jesus says: Put your sword away because if you live by the sword you die by the sword. These passages show Jesus wrestling with his fear about what he is to confront. That fear leads him to consider violence (get a sword). He prays and finds the strength to eschew violence. This story is more about Jesus overcoming his fear and his temptation to use violence and overcoming that temptation. It is not a story about Jesus exhorting the disciples to get swords and use them.\n \n Mt:26:47: And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 48: Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. 49: And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. 50: And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. 51: And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. 52: Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.\n \n Jesus also says:\n \n Mt:10:34: Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. 35: For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.\n \n Do you really think he meant he came to give swords to everyone so they can kill their fathers and mothers? Doesn't it make more sense to see this as spoken in allegory rather than meaning that he came to give swords to everyone?\n \n Imagine if someone quoted Peter out of context when he denied Jesus and said, see, he didn't really believe. This story contrasts Jesus finding strength in faith and Peter succumbing to fear. It does not exhort anyone to get a sword and use it.",

I believe that he refers to the God of Abraham and the God of Moses, the \"elohiym\" as well as \"Hayeh Hayeh\" of Exodus. I poke a little fun at Michelangelo's rendition on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, that is all. I know the Creator to be something beyond my ability to comprehend and I know that people have tried through the ages to draw or paint of sculpt the Creator. Those renderings are limited by the limits of the minds of the men who form them. \"\"Hayeh Hayeh\" is something beyond our wildest imagination.\n \n \n2.

Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.\" \n If you read what you quote, it has the phrase \"the two will become one flesh.\" You know that that does not happen. It is metaphoric language. I left my father and my mother, I am united with my wife, but I still go to work while she stays home. We are not literally \"one flesh\" however, we are spiritually \"one\" but not physically or one in the flesh. If we do not accept the metaphoric language of Jesus and Moses, we look ridiculous.\n \n \nIt's pretty obvious to me that Jesus is referring to Genesis (your \"myth\" story). So how do you get out of this??\nJesus is definitely referring to the story of Genesis, but Genesis is not a story to be read literally, otherwise it makes no sense. Jesus refers to the \"elohiym\" as our Father, but \"elohiym\", is not my father, my father is my dad. Again, Jesus is talking metaphorically not literally when he tells me to pray to my father who is within me (the Kingdom of God of within you). He can't mean my dad is inside me. He also can't mean that God is in my stomach or intestines. He uses the image as a metaphor. We cannot understand the teachings of Jesus and the teachings of Moses unless we understand their use of metaphor and allegory.\n \n You never responded to my post on your claim that Jesus advocated use of a sword.

It's not like history where there are two or more equally valid views of the same issue, both forming part of the study of history. Evolution is a scientific theory, neither creationism nor ID is scientific. At best they are philosophical positions that can be explored in the appropriate class. By all means explore the gaps and disputes in current evolutionary theory, but teaching something that doesn't have empirical evidence to support it in a science class, just because it happens to fit which someone's religious beliefs is plain daft.",

   "Howard - \n \n Here's more information on Cain's wife per your question earlier:\n \n Cain's brothers and sisters\n \n Cain was the first child of Adam and Eve recorded in Scripture (Genesis 4:1). His brothers, Abel (Genesis 4:2) and Seth (Genesis 4:25), were part of the first generation of children ever born on this Earth.\n \n Even though only these three males are mentioned by name, Adam and Eve had other children. In Genesis 5:4 a statement sums up the life of Adam and Eve-'And the days of Adam after he had fathered Seth were eight hundred years. And he fathered sons and daughters.' This does not say when they were born. Many could have been born in the 130 years (Genesis 5:3) before Seth was born.\n \n During their lives, Adam and Eve had a number of male and female children. The Jewish historian Josephus wrote that, 'The number of Adam's children, as says the old tradition, was thirty-three sons and twenty-three daughters.'11\n \n The Bible does not tell us how many children were born to Adam and Eve. However, considering their long life spans (Adam lived for 930 years-Genesis 5:5), it would seem reasonable to suggest there were many! Remember, they were commanded to 'Be fruitful, and multiply' (Genesis 1:28).\n \n The wife\n \n If we now work totally from Scripture, without any personal prejudices or other extra-Biblical ideas, then back at the beginning, when there was only the first generation, brothers would have had to have married sisters or there would be no more generations! \n \n Some claim that the passage in Genesis 4:16-17 means that Cain went to the land of Nod and found a wife. Thus, they can conclude there must have been another race of people on the Earth, who were not descendants of Adam, who produced Cain's wife. \n 'And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and he called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.'\n \n From what has been stated previously, it is clear that all humans, Cain's wife included, are descendants of Adam. However, this passage does not say that Cain went to the land of Nod and found a wife. John Calvin, commenting on these verses, states: \n \n 'From the context we may gather that Cain, before he slew his brother, had married a wife; otherwise Moses would now have related something respecting his marriage.'13\n \n Cain was married before he went to the land of Nod. He didn't find a wife there, but 'knew' (had sexual relations with) his wife.14\n \n Others have argued that because Cain built a 'city' in the land of Nod, there must have been a lot of people there. However, the Hebrew word translated as 'city' need not mean what we might imagine from the connotations of 'city' today. The word meant a 'walled town' or a protected encampment.15 \n \n Even a hundred people would be plenty for such a 'city.' Nevertheless, there could have been many descendants of Adam on the Earth by the time of Abel's death (see below). \n \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/tools/cains_wife.asp",

God exists in a form beyond our measly intellects to conceive of, so I will not be part of the blasphemy of limiting God to being either intelligent or a designer.

Your argument is one used often in the interpretation of poetry. You are indicating without saying it, that Genesis is poetry, a form which requires us to understand the silences.

It is really a long and windy road to get that to mean that tree symbolizes Jesus. If you want to say that the Tree of Life symbolizes Jesus, we can discuss that, but the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is a completely different tree than the Tree of Life.\n \n Gen:2:9: And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\n \n Gen:3:22: And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:\n \n It begs the question: Why would man be forbidden to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil?\n \n \nWhat post # was it, and what date?

The first is in Gen 6:5-8; 7:1-5, 7, 10, 12, 16b-20, 22-23; 8:2b-3a, 6, 8-12, 13b, 20-22. The second is in 6:9-22; 7:8-9, 11, 13-16a, 21, 24; 8:1-2a, 3b-5, 7, 13a, 14-19; 9:1-17.[*]Genealogy from Shem - Gen. 10:21-31 and 11:10-26.[*]Abraham's migration - Gen. 12:1-4a and 12:4b-5.[*]The Abrahamic covenant - Gen. 15 and 17.[*]Joseph sold into Egypt - Gen. 37;2b, 3b, 5-11, 19-20, 23, 25b-27, 28b, 31-35; 39;1 and 37:3a, 4, 12-18, 21-22, 24, 25a, 28a, 29-30.[*]The Decalog - Exd. 20:1-17 and 34:10-28 and Deut. 5:6-18.[*]Centralization of sacrifice - Lev. 17 and Deut. 12.[*]Forbidden animals - Lev. 11 and Deut. 14.\n Source: The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Doubleday Pub.\n \n Contradictions between these doublets abound, as do differences in terminology. For example, the order of creation in one of the Genesis accounts is plants, then animals, then man and woman, while in the other it is man, then plants, then animals, then woman. The number of animals taken onto the ark differ beteween the two flood stories. In one set of creation/flood doublets, the author consistently refers to God as \"God\" whereas in the other set of doublets the author consistently refers to God as \"Lord God\". \n \n The existence of these doublets along with their internal characteristics (contradiction, terminology, historical/geographical referents, etc.) strongly suggests that two sets of these stories were eventually merged into one; sometimes with finesse, other times rather clumsily. Where did they come from? Probably one set from Israel and the other from Judah during the period of the divided kingdom. Who merged them together? Possibly Ezra, during the time of the Babylonian exile. Where is the evidence for multiple authorship of the Torah? It is contained within the Torah itself.\n \n EZ, with regard to this evidence, I've given you only a sample; the tip of the iceberg so to speak. The totality of evidence in support of multiple authorship of the Torah is formidible. However, it's not my intent to tutor you. If you're interested in discussing this subject with me, I'd be happy to do so on condition that you research the subject so that you're in a position to discuss it intelligently.

   "Getting back to your belief / admission that elohyim (I spell it elohim) created man:\n \n That creation of man is an extraordinary accomplishment, even if you want to argue that man then evolved from intelligently designed single celled organisms. The genetic complexity of even an amoeba is extremely impressive. I think a logical argument can be made that with that kind of intellectual acumen, there's no limit to what else such a God can create, including a universe if he wanted to.\n \n Nevertheless, I think it's fair to say you also are a Creationist, at least of man. And that the creation of life by God would certainly qualify as intelligent design.\nThe fact that man exists is something that no scientist would deny either. The forces that brought man into existence however are a different story. Creationists take the arrogant position that they know the forces behind creation and that they know the mind of those forces (intelligent) and the task of those forces (design). I claim no such knowledge and challenge their assertion that they have such knowledge. I have repeatedly said that there is no evidence that God is some grand Calvin Kline in the sky.\n \n Scientists know they do not know, so using their method, they search to understand. Creationists believe they know. Once you believe you know you have left the Kingdom of God and entered the realm of arrogant man, believing you know things beyond your ability to know. It is one thing to strive to understand the unknowable (like scientists) and another thing to be sure that you know the unknowable (like creationists). \n \n As I have said before, to claim that creation is an intelligent design is to blaspheme and claim to know the mind and essence of God. Any scientist would agree that there are things that are unexplainable in the universe. A scientist believes that he can come to understand some of those things using a tool called the scientific method. A creationist knows (but can't prove) that his version of God intelligently designed the universe. I know that I do not know anything about the creative forces or the creations of the universe other than there are forces at work I cannot know or understand.\n \n I notice that you have avoided addressing every statement (along with the scriptural support for those statements) I have posted on this thread that disagrees with your positions. I am not sure if you are humbling seeking knowledge of if you are sure you already know and fear that your certainty may be undermined by humbly seeking deeper understanding.",

Maybe intelligent design IS bad because it's disputable scientifically, but it's not bad based on the idea that we can't know the mind of God or that its an anthropomorphism.\nI never said it was bad, I simply said it was fabricated.\n \n \nSo you have a beef with self-assuredness on their part? Well, that's more an issue of determination and perhaps stubborness. But it has nothing do to do with the actual issue itself.\nThat is the very issue. You are not describing a self-assured person, you are describing delusional person. You cannot force something to be a valid scientific theory by determination, self-assuredness and stubbornness. Determination and stubbornness in the face of knowledge is no virtue. It seems to bother you that faith might be to acknowledge that we do not know.",

One of the great blasphemies of our time is the belief that we can limit God to human characteristics and endeavors. I believe that God is beyond my ability to conceive of.

It can't be held to scrutiny using scientific principles. For me, that is fine. Science is limited just like the human mind.

   "EZ:\n \n Yes, I am coming to see that we agree on a lot. I think it is because we have both made a concerted effort (and I acknowledge that I have not always succeeded in that effort) to stay respectful in our discourse.\n \n \nRegarding the sword not being metaphoric in the first instance above, what then was the purpose in buying it? \n I think that goes to the reason for the \"Agony in the Garden\". I want to take it verse by verse.\n \n First Luke 22:\n \n 36: Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.\n \n Jesus clearly tells them to use their money to but swords.\n \n 37: For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.  \n \n Jesus does not say it must be accomplished by him, he says in him. This reflects on Luke 17:21 \"...The Kingdom of Heaven is within you.\" He may well be talking about the winning the battle with temptation that he faces and confronts in Gethsemane. \n \n 38: And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.  \n \n \"It is enough.\" is also appropriately translated as \"That is enough.\" (See Mt 6:23) So, when they show Jesus two swords he may very well be upset with himself and his weakness in temptation and say \"That's enough!\"\n \n 39: And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. 40: And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.  \n \n Then he goes to pray and warns them about temptation. It seems to me that the temptation Jesus is talking about is the temptation to use violence.\n \n 41: And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, 42: Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. \n \n Here Jesus clearly is praying that he doesn't want to deal with what is in front of him, but wants to do the Father's will.\n \n 43: And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. 44: And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.\n \n Here Jesus gets the strength to resist the temptation.\n \n 45: And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, 46: And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.\n \n Then he goes and warns his disciples that they should have been praying too instead of sleeping because they might succumb to the temptation (using violence) without the strength of the Father.\n \n Then move on to Mt 26\n \n 47: And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 48: Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. 49: And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. 50: And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. 51: And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. 52: Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.\n \n Here it is clear that Jesus has overcome temptation (as he did when Satan tempted him earlier in his life). He eschews violence and puts his disciple on the right (non-violent) path again with an all encompassing statement: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.\n \n This is not limited it is \"all\" who take up the sword.

Instead we find that Jesus in fact violated a number of Biblical commandments: 1. Procreation \"Be fruitful and multiply\" (Genesis 1:28). This obligates a person to\n marry and have children. Jesus remained single his entire life. He also\n encouraged others to disobey this commandment by recommending celibacy\n (Matthew 19:12)\n \n 1. God certainly doesn't seem too upset with the following eunuchs who remain childless. In fact he commends them: \n \n Isaiah 56:4 For this is what the LORD says: \n \"To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, \n who choose what pleases me \n and hold fast to my covenant- \n \n 5 to them I will give within my temple and its walls \n a memorial and a name \n better than sons and daughters; \n I will give them an everlasting name \n that will not be cut off.  \n \n 2.

I find nothing distastefull in Christian doctrine and lots that is helpful, so why does it really matter if I can prove the existence of God?\n \n If God was nothing more than a philosopher, expousing high ideals of personal behavior, why would I find him distasteful? Love thy neighbor, don't lie, steal, kill, these aren't exactly wildly counter-culture ideals and make good sense to me for anyone living in a civilized world.

   "Let's try and stay on topic, shall we? If you favour anarchy, we might discuss that as a separate topic. \n\n \n Hey, then stay on topic.\n \n \nSo far as science teachers confine their lectures to science, which is what they are expected to do, I see no problem, your paranoia notwithstanding. What would upset me, though, is for some science teacher to proclaim: \"The earth revolves around the sun, according to God's divine plan\", or, \"This bridge will hold 500 tons, God willing\".\n\n \n A desire to see the education of kids not be reduced due to lawsuits, or for teachers to have the freedom to exercise a reasonable level of autonomy in their teaching is hardly paranoia. The point is that you can't really enforce the things you're talking about when school administrators are behind it. You may want a school to do things the way you want, but if a school is determined not to do that, there's ultimately little you can do. And again, I assert it's not worth it anyway.\n \n Furthermore, why would it upset you if a teacher says \"The earth revolves around the sun, according to God's divine plan,\" as long as the science is still being taught? It seems to me that as long as the scientific teaching is there, then the science is in no way reduced by an aside religious statement. Your example isn't a case of science being replaced by religion. And certainly this isn't a case of it being \"imposed\" on anyone--no one is being forced to accept anything. I don't see any reason why it's any more upsetting for a teacher to mention a religious opinion (without reducing the scientific teaching) any more that it should be upsetting for him to ever mention any other opinion in class that was not religion-oriented. \n \n \nFor which I'm very grateful.\n\n \n I've taken you to be a good centrist, fair debater, above ad hominem and invective. Why would you suddenly throw something like that in? I think I've been more than civil to you. \n \n \nParanoia strikes again, or perhaps a red herring? Do you understand the meaning of the term \"red herring\"? Wanna increase the number of teachers and their qualifications? Then, dig into your pocket. \n\n \n I'm arguing it would be a consequence of what you would do (regulate the words of teachers).

And besides, we aren't talking about Hitler or genocidal atrocities, we're talking about someone uttering the \"C\" word in class.

They involve prejudice and judging people. That's a whole different matter than saying something like \"I think the fact the earth revolves around the sun is because God wills it.\" You are intentionally taking prejudicial issues and trying to make them analogize a benign one. And it just doesn't work. Believe it or not, the content of what's said DOES matter.

We're to the point that we can clone people and do many miraculous things, so why don't you just go on and get lost.\"\n \n God listened very patiently and kindly to the man and after the scientist was done talking, God said, \"Very well, how about this, let's say we have a man making contest.\" To which the scientist replied, \"OK, great!\" But God added, \"Now, we're going to do this just like I did back in the old days with Adam.\" The scientist said, \"No problem.

   "AIDS kills everyone, not just gays. The only reason that gays catch AIDS disproportionately in America is that patient zero in North America was gay. If he had been straight it would have been a largely \"straight\" disease. Look at the demographics in Africa, where the disease started, if you don't believe this. AIDS is killing without reference to sexual preference there.\n\n \n Yea, yea, yea, I'm well aware of the politically correct answer. I liken it to car accidents. Yes, anybody can get into a car accident, but you're much, much more likely if you're drunk. The same goes for AIDS in the US. The probability of contracting AIDS from having only straight partners, who have only had straight partners is slim, unless you're a junkie. The liklihood of contracting AIDS through gay partners is orders of magnitude higher.\n \n And Africa's AIDS epidemic is a whole different story. It's an attempt to cloud the issue by comparing apples and oranges.",

The other, a large burial cemetery unearthed near the modern Dominus Flevit Chapel, was excavated by Italian scholar, P. Bagatti.\n \n Both archaeologists found evidence clearly dating the two catacombs to the first century AD, with the later finding coins minted by Governor Varius Gratus at the turn of the millenium (up to 15/16 AD). Evidence in both catacombs indicated their use for burial until the middle part of the first century AD, several years before the New Testament was written. \n \n As Claremont-Ganneau continued to investigate the catacomb, he found additional inscriptions including the name \"Yeshua\" (=\"Jesus\") commemoratively inscribed on several ossuaries.\n \n Photographs in the links below.\n \n http://www.leaderu.com/theology/burialcave.html\n\n \n All very interesting.
