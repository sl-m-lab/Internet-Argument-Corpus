   "Evidently, there's no limit been set yet. This appears to be the most idiotic thing I have seen in the recent past. The Republican Senate wants to give rebates to every adult and couple earning less than a specified amount as a help with gasoline costs...REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY EVEN OWN A CAR OR NOT!\n \n If they really want to help the users of gasoline, maybe they could lower the Federal tax on it. States might do the same if they want to help those who are actually suffering from the high prices.\n \n To give a rebate to EVERYBODY makes no sense to me.\n \n \n \n \n \n http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/27/gas.rebate/index.html\n \n WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Most American taxpayers would get $100 rebate checks to offset the pain of higher pump prices for gasoline, under an amendment Senate Republicans hope to bring to a vote Thursday.\n \n However, the GOP energy package may face tough sledding because it also includes a controversial proposal to open part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil exploration, which most Democrats and some moderate Republicans oppose.\n \n Democrats are also expected to offer their own competing proposal, as members of both parties jockey for political position on the gas price issue.\n \"Our plan would give taxpayers a hundred dollar gas tax holiday rebate check to help ease the pain that they're feeling at the pump,\" Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist announced Thursday. \"It also includes strong federal anti-price gouging protection to protect consumers against anti-competitive behavior by oil companies or other suppliers of gasoline. Our free market system works, but it works best when there's full accountability and full transparency.\" \n \n Frist said the rebates would go to single taxpayers making less than $125,000 per year, and couples making less than $150,000.\n \n Republican senators said they hoped soaring gas prices would inspire Democrats to support their proposals.\n \n \"A lot of these other things we're talking about today, supply, like ANWR, have had Democrats oppose them in the past, when gas was $1.25, $1.50. Gas is now $3,\" said John Thune, R-South Dakota. \"I would expect that there would be a lot more bipartisan support for proposals that would increase supply in this country.\"\n \n \"We have been trying for years to do something about supply without their help. I hope now that we'll have their help,\" he added.\n But Democrats seemed unimpressed.\n \n \"It's designed to protect Big Oil while mistakenly believing that drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will solve America's energy problems,\" Jim Manley, a spokesman for Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, told The Associated Press.\n \n The energy package, sponsored by Sens. Charles Grassley of Iowa, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, will be offered as an amendment to an emergency spending measure now before the Senate funding the Iraq war and hurricane relief, according to a senior GOP leadership aide.\n \n Under Senate rules, either the GOP amendment or the Democratic alternative would probably need 60 votes to pass, which is considered unlikely. However, the amendments would give senators a change to cast votes on measures designed to help constituents being hit by high gas prices.\n \n As outlined by Frist and other GOP senators, the energy package would give taxpayers a $100 rebate, repeal tax incentives for oil companies and allow the Federal Trade Commission to prosecute retailers unlawfully inflating the price of gasoline.\n \n The measure would also give the Transportation Department authority to issue fuel efficiency standards for passenger vehicles, expand tax incentives for the use of hybrid vehicles and push for more research into alternative fuels and expansion of existing oil refineries.\n \n The GOP senators are also calling on the Bush administration to suspend deposits into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for six months to increase the nation's oil supply. President Bush announced Tuesday that he would halt new deposits into the reserve until after the summer driving season. (Full story)\n \n On the other side of the aisle, Democrats on Wednesday called for a new energy bill and federal legislation to punish price gougers.\n \n \"There's no reason why we can't put forth a real energy policy that addresses the needs of this nation,\" said Rep. Bart Stupak, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, \"from gouging to market manipulation to biofuels. We can do it.\" (Full story)\n \n And leaders of the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday asked the Internal Revenue Service to let them examine the tax returns of the nation's 15 largest oil and gas companies, as part of a \"comprehensive review\" of oil industry profits.\n \n \"I want to make sure the oil companies aren't taking a speed pass by the tax man,\" said Grassley, the committee's chairman, in a written statement.

You are taking one small part of a huge document and bashing it over thier heads. So far they have done well. It just burns you up that we have suceeeded in freeing them. Doesn't it? Would you like us to put Saddam back?\n\n Its not too early to see its going to get a lot worse before it gets better though, and when you say its a small part it is a fairly fundamental part of it really. It means if there is ever any conflict between Islamic law and the rights garunteed by the constitution then Islamic law wins out. Makes a lot of it completely ludicrous seeing as while \"Each Iraqi has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religious belief and practice. Coercion in such matters shall be prohibited\". This of course only applies if we are dealing with people of the Book (Abrahamic religions) as the laws of Islam rate over this. \n While we're at it 'The right of free expression shall be protected' as long as its not drawing images of God or the prophet Muhammed or other idolotary.\n \n What point really is there a constitution unless it is the highest law in the land? Its too vague to really be considered as a basis for laws, and it even states that it isn't to be used as a basis for laws (its just there to fill in the gaps that Islamic law doesn't cover, copy protection and suchlike).",

For the first time in 50 years islamic fundamentalists are running the place. \n \n They are certainly on the right track if the goal was to created ain islamic fundamentalist state. If the goal was to create a free society, they have taken a huge step backwards. \n \n Unfortunatly it is too late to put saddam back. This is really too bad, since he DID keep the place in oder for a lot of years, kep tthe ethnic groups from killing each other, and kept modernizing the country. Iraq was withotu question the most \"western\" nation in the ME.\n \n Now they are just another islamic fundamentalist state. One small part of a huge document? That one small part invalidates the entire rest of the document. None of the gains you claim exist unless they are allowable under sharia law.",

What kind of position does it put the EU in if the Kurds claim a few thousand miles of Turkey as their own and Turkey retaliates.\n \n When Saddam attacked the Kurds, it was not a hobby. They were building up military units, including armored columns, for a run at independance. They were not sitting at home, saddam was bored, so he said \"Lets kill some Kurds today\", they were arming and actively planning for a full scale civil war.\n \n After we moved in and Saddam was under sanctions and the Kurds were protected, they accelerated their efforts to train men and stockpile weapons. When we removed saddam and disbanded the IRaqi military, they picked up a LOT of weapons that were left unguarded.\n \n Now you have a heavily armed ethnic group that has been actively planning for years to carve their own country out of Iraq, Iran, and Turkey and they are essentiallyt out fo the cage. There is no Saddam to stop them, and they have autonomy. \n \n I don't think that the US is going to do or say anything. We set a pretty poor precedent with our Israeli policies and the PR campaign to defend them. Anytimesomebody suggested that maybe supporting a bunch of racist war criminals in the ME was a bad idea, we essentailly responded \"Don't they deserve their own homeland\". We can't very well complain now about the Kurds, or the Albanians, or any other group taking a homeland without looking like a bunch of hypocrites. Not that the current administration seems to mind looking like a bunch of hypocrites.",
