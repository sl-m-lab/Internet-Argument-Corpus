   "The recent defeat of school vouchers in Florida (as seen on the thread in this forum) is a defeat for those who wish to break the stranglehold that the education \"establishment\" and the teacher's unions have on \"traditional\" public schools. I've seen (much to my chagrin) that supporters of the status quo come across saying: \"pay for private schooling,\" etc. The problem I, as well as a good chunk of parents have, is that private schooling is far too expensive save for those with six+ figure incomes. What are we left with? Mediocre at best schools.\n \n Now, there is an alternative to the public school monopoly here in New York State that has been getting great results: Charter Schools!! In my thread:\"Charter School Success...,\" I pointed out that the charters, for the most part have been running circles around the \"establishment\" schools with excellent results.\n \n For a refresher; charter schools are autonomous freestanding schools that are funded by tax dollars and are not beholden to either the district, nor the teacher's unions. Teacher accountability and higher academic and discipline standards account for their success. Without healthy competition from charters, homeschooling, and vouchers, public schools in the US will continue to be laughingstock.",
