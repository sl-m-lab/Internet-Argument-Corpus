   "Oh boy, you folks down there in the Sunshine state better be prepared for the fundie invasion ahead. The best and brightest of the professional right-wing fundamentalist fearmongerer set are coming to \"inform and empower involved Christian citizenship,\" according to its web site.\n \n Tampa will host the Family Impact Summit, which will feature Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, failed Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer, the American Family Association's Don Wildmon, the Southern Baptist Convention's Richard Land, Katherine Harris (just when we thought we'd seen the last of her!), Ohio vote vacuumer Ken Blackwell, Bob Knight of the Media Research Center, as well as \"ex-gay\" promoters Nancy Heche (actress Anne's mom), and the \"ex-gay-for-pay\" President of Exodus International, Alan Chambers.\n \n There will be no fewer than six panels on homosexuality (Homosexuality & Ministry, Homosexuality & Youth, and the Homosexual Agenda are covered on Saturday and Sunday). Ah, our friend Bishop Harry (\"Obama's misinformed\") Jackson is in that motley crew.\n \n As Right Wing Watch reports:\n \n In between the gay-bashing, there will also be panels on \"Christian Citizenship\" and \"Community Decency,\" as well as keynote addresses from Bauer, Perkins, Ken Blackwell, and Harry Jackson. What you won't find at this summit, as of yet, is GOP presidential candidates - even though most of them are reportedly scheduled to be attending the \"Values Voter Debate\" in Fort Lauderdale on September 17, which is being hosted by a separate, but not mutually exclusive, group of influential right-wing leaders.\n \n The debate is being sponsored by the people who brought us the \"Values Voters' Contract With Congress,\" which was itself launched at Vision America's \"War on Christian and Values Voters Conference\" in 2006 and supported by right-wing stalwarts such as Phyllis Schlafly, Alan Keyes, Lou Sheldon, Janet Folger, D. James Kennedy, Rod Parsley, and others.\n \n You can watch the promotional video here. The conference organizers have made sure to provide travel pointers to \"clean hotels\" that are free of pay-for-play porn on the TVs.\n \n www.americablog.com",
