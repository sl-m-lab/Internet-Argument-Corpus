   "This is seizure of Israel soldiers by Hezbollah! Well, Israel position about hostages is well-known in the world -Israel will never follow terrorists wish, never; even the price of it will be the life of hostages. But I think that it was the fist situation in history that Israel unleashed large-scale military operation as a result of it. \n To tell the truth I nave enough questions about this fact. And first of all, as a result of what so decision was made? IMO numerous military class of Israel - Hevre, took care of it. The fact is that during last years militarists in Israel trumpeted about scanty financing of Tsahal. They tried to pressure at everybody, starting with Prime Minister and ended by simple citizens but no one heard them. As a result of it Hevre planed mass provocation and discredit of its own army in Lebanon. This conflict showed that Israel army isn't ready to such sort of operations; in fact we choked in this fight with Hezbollah. And Hevre needed it. They heed super-profits in spite at the fact that Tsahal's getting much money. It's well-known that money for army in most cases doesn't come to addressee settling in the pockets of military officials by false organizations.\n That's why they organized this conflict with Hezbollah for the sake of their own profits but in result of it they sapped Israel authority and created the ground for Arabs uniting!",
