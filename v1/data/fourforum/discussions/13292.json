Studies have found that approximately 75% of murderers have adult criminal records, and that murderers average a prior adult criminal career of six years, including four major adult felony arrests. These studies also found that when the murder occurred [a]bout 11% of murder arrestees [were] actually on pre-trial release--that is, they were awaiting trial for another offense. \n \n The fact that only 75% of murderers have adult crime records should not be misunderstood as implying that the remaining 25% of murderers are non-criminals. The reason over half of those 25% of murderers don't have adult records is that they are juveniles. Thus, by definition they cannot have an adult criminal record. Juvenile criminal records might well show these murderers to have extensive serious criminal records. \n\n \n There! I fixed it for you!",

   "\"Too many...\" Interesting words. From a previous post of mine where someone said there are \"many, many shootings\": \nI have many, many vinyl records. A music store has many, many vinyl records... I'm an avid collector, but I'm not rich. *wink* The \"...many, many shootings,\" part will be decided by each person. (Though that might make me sound callous, it's true.)\n Emotions are difficult to quantify. One violent crime is too many - gun or not.\n \n \nToo many. Here's one (badum tish!)\n \n Snip...Psychopath kills people over watermelon...Snip\n \n Permission to weep granted.\n\n \n Wrong use of the ba-dum-tish, and that's MY \"thing.\" :p emoticon_rolleyes it IS possible for a criminal to own a gun - look at me. Breaking the law makes you a criminal as an act of crime was committed. The officer responding to the accident stated that I drove left of the center line - which is against the law here. I was then mauled by a semi-truck, but that's another story. emoticon_xbouncer So yeah, criminals can own guns in the US. FELONS are not allowed to own guns however- they're a more worserer type of criminal than I. ;)\n \n My point is: I broke the law, I'm a criminal, and I own a gun. Playing with semantics? Maybe, but that's not my point. \n \n The point is this: this insane individual, (nobody would kill anybody over a piece of watermelon unless they are insane,) has now* committed a crime (a felony no less,) and will not be able to own a gun. Is it regrettable that there was a loss of innocent life? Always. \n \n However, he is insane (obviously,) and folks that are mentally unsound are NOT eligible to own firearms legally, anyway. Did he have any past history of psychiatric trouble? If so, why did he have a gun? The second you become mentally unstable, you are no longer able to legally own a firearm. There are laws in place that stop that. Why wasn't this detected earlier? I'm sure it is rather rare that \"Nice Guy A\" just decides to up and shoot his family over a piece of watermelon one day. emoticon_rolleyes My goodness - if I shot my family for every time they snuck a piece of watermelon from the party platter, they'd be dead hundreds of times over. emoticon_rolleyes We have 11 guns in my house - most are loaded - rifles, pistols, shotguns. NONE of them have ever been used in a crime, and the only \"person\" hurt or killed by them is JohnnyBadGuyPaperTarget. \n \n *Barring that man the right to own a gun BEFORE he was deemed insane, or BEFORE he committed a crime is: \n A.) against the US Constitution - the highest laws of the US\n and \n B.) just plain silly. Innocent until proven guilty and all that. This conjures up images of \"Minority Report\" with the \"Pre-Crime\" and all. (If you haven't seen the movie and are unsure of what I'm talking about, just let me know and I can give a brief run-down. emoticon_xchicken)\n \n Some folks may not like the fact that honest, law-abiding Americans can own guns... Tough titties. If you don't like it, you are free to not own firearms, or are free to leave. If you live elsewhere, go make yourself useful and deal with your own country's problems - or pee up a twisted rope. emoticon_smile\n \n On a related note... is it just me, or do people forget that humans have been killing each other since time immemorial? Sticks and stones, lions and spears, swords, telephone cords, screwdrivers, cannons, canyons, burning them alive, cement shoes, pillows, pens, guns... The methods may change, but the fact remains - some people will kill, (or harm) other people. Is it wrong? Yeah. Will it change? ...Not until we're all transcendental, glowing, floating orbs of consciousness that exist beyond the mortal plane and seek to only understand the mysteries of the universe and existence.\n \n \nPermission to weep granted.\nPermission? Oh you. I feel sadness for innocent lives lost. If the psycho would have drowned his child and gutted his wife with a towel rack, I would still feel sadness for them.\n \n With that, I bid you farewell. May your lives be blessed with happiness and wealth, and may the wind be always at your backs. emoticon_xbye I have lawns to mow. emoticon_xchicken",
