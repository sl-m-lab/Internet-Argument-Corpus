   "Any of this sound familiar? \n \n \n \n \n The 14 Characteristics of Fascism \n by Lawrence Britt \n Spring 2003 \n Free Inquiry magazine \n \n \n \n Political scientist Dr. Lawrence Britt recently wrote an article about fascism (\"Fascism Anyone?,\" Free Inquiry, Spring 2003, page 20). Studying the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia), and Pinochet (Chile), Dr. Britt found they all had 14 elements in common. He calls these the identifying characteristics of fascism. The excerpt is in accordance with the magazine's policy. \n \n The 14 characteristics are: \n \n 1.Powerful and Continuing Nationalism \n Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays. \n \n \n 2.Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights \n Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. \n \n \n 3.Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause \n The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. \n \n \n 4.Supremacy of the Military \n Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. \n \n \n 5.Rampant Sexism \n The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy. \n \n \n 6.Controlled Mass Media \n Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common. \n \n \n 7.Obsession with National Security \n Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. \n \n \n 8.Religion and Government are Intertwined \n Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions. \n \n \n 9.Corporate Power is Protected \n The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite. \n \n \n 10.Labor Power is Suppressed \n Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed . \n \n \n 11.Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts \n Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts. \n \n \n 12.Obsession with Crime and Punishment \n Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. \n \n \n 13.Rampant Cronyism and Corruption \n Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders. \n \n \n 14.Fraudulent Elections \n Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.",

Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n\n \n Patriotism and nationalism isn't a sign of facism.\n \n \n \n2.Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights \n Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n\n \n Knowing you, this is directed at the cases in Iraq. Bush has already said that these soldiers will be punished severely, and indeed many of them have been. This is an isolated incident.\n \n \n \n3.Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause \n The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\n\n \n Hey, guess what? There are terrorists out there, and they're trying to kill us. They are a common threat, not only to Americans, but to anyone who won't agree with them.\n \n \n \n4.Supremacy of the Military \n Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\n \n The military is not given a disproportionate amount of funding. History has time and again shown that a nation needs a strong, well funded, well trained military force to ensure it's survival. I rather like the idea that we have the most capable military in the world.\n \n And there are a great many soldiers who deserve fully to be glamorized. Military service is a very noble thing to do, you're voluntarily agreeing to protect your country.\n \n \n \n5.Rampant Sexism \n The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.\n\n \n Hmmmm...I don't think the Bush administration ever said that homosexuality is or should be illegal. And sexism in govermental positions? Two words, chief: CONDOLEEZZA RICE.\n \n \n \n6.Controlled Mass Media \n Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\n\n \n We really don't have a censorship issue in the US. This argument is ridiculous. What 'controlled mass media' infers are things like state-run television, no freedom of speech, and censorship of media before publication. We don't have these things. There will always be some censorship in wartime, and for damn good reasons. In the Iraq war, there was actually a great deal of media freedom in reporting what was going on.\n \n \n \n7.Obsession with National Security \n Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\n \n Okay, there are quite a few people who want to kill us. They're trying to right now. They have done so successfully in the past. If anything, we're not doing enough to ensure national security.\n \n \n8.Religion and Government are Intertwined \n Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\n\n \n Except for the fact that gvernment and religion are not intertwined. Yes, Bush talks about God in his speeches, which is undoubtedly what you're trying to attack. But every American president has sworn on the Bible, each session of congress begins with a prayer, and so does the Supreme Court.\n \n \n \n9.Corporate Power is Protected \n The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\n \n This is called capitalism. I don't like it, but it does happen. It's not facist.\n \n \n \n10.Labor Power is Suppressed \n Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed. \n\n \n Never heard anything about this going on.\n \n \n \n11.Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts \n Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.\n\n \n Ummm, both presidential candidates went to Yale. A good number of graduationg high school students go on to college. Free expression of 'the arts' is openly attacked when people say or do something completely idiotic. Janet Jackson? The Dixie Chicks? They're XXXXXX, and that's why what they're saying or doing is attacked.\n \n \n \n12.Obsession with Crime and Punishment \n Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\n \n There is no police force with nearly unlimited powers in the US. The police are not given anything even close to limitless powers. Yes, we do have to accept that some civil liberties must be forgone to preserve our safety. I, for one, am willing to accept that.\n \n \n \n13.Rampant Cronyism and Corruption \n Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\n \n If you're about to become the leader of the most powerful nation on earth, who do you want in your staff? I'd say people with whom you have personal ties who are fully competent and qualified for their positions.\n \n \n \n14.Fraudulent Elections \n Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes No one stole the election. Get over it.

   "How E-Voting Threatens Democracy\n Wired News \n \n In January 2003, voting activist Bev Harris was holed up in the basement of her three-story house in Renton, Washington, searching the Internet for an electronic voting machine manual, when she made a startling discovery. \n \n Clicking on a link for a file transfer protocol site belonging to voting machine maker Diebold Election Systems, Harris found about 40,000 unprotected computer files. They included source code for Diebold's AccuVote touch-screen voting machine, program files for its Global Election Management System tabulation software, a Texas voter-registration list with voters' names and addresses, and what appeared to be live vote data from 57 precincts in a 2002 California primary election. \n \n \"There was a lot of stuff that shouldn't have been there,\" Harris said. \n \n The California file was time-stamped 3:31 p.m. on Election Day, indicating that Diebold might have obtained the data during voting. But polling precincts aren't supposed to release votes until after polls close at 8 p.m. So Harris began to wonder if it were possible for the company to extract votes during an election and change them without anyone knowing. \n \n Harris discovered that she could enter the vote database using Microsoft Access -- a standard program often bundled with Microsoft Office -- and change votes without leaving a trace. Diebold hadn't password-protected the file or secured the audit log, so anyone with access to the tabulation program during an election -- Diebold employees, election staff or even hackers if the county server were connected to a phone line -- could change votes and alter the log to erase the evidence. \n \n \"It was getting scarier and scarier,\" Harris said. \"I was thinking we have an immense problem here that's much bigger than me.\" \n \n Read entire article... \n \n http://www.wired.com/news/evote/0,2645,62790,00.html",

Wallace, Democracy Reborn (New York, 1944), edited by Russell Lord, p. 259.\n \n Sunday 09 April 1944\n \n On returning from my trip to the West in February, I received a request from The New York Times to write a piece answering the following questions:\n \n What is a fascist?\n How many fascists have we?\n How dangerous are they?\n \n A fascist is one whose lust for money or power is combined with such an intensity of intolerance toward those of other races, parties, classes, religions, cultures, regions or nations as to make him ruthless in his use of deceit or violence to attain his ends. The supreme god of a fascist, to which his ends are directed, may be money or power; may be a race or a class; may be a military, clique or an economic group; or may be a culture, religion, or a political party.\n \n The perfect type of fascist throughout recent centuries has been the Prussian Junker, who developed such hatred for other races and such allegiance to a military clique as to make him willing at all times to engage in any degree of deceit and violence necessary to place his culture and race astride the world. In every big nation of the world are at least a few people who have the fascist temperament. Every Jew-baiter, every Catholic hater, is a fascist at heart. The hoodlums who have been desecrating churches, cathedrals and synagogues in some of our larger cities are ripe material for fascist leadership.\n \n The obvious types of American fascists are dealt with on the air and in the press. These demagogues and stooges are fronts for others. Dangerous as these people may be, they are not so significant as thousands of other people who have never been mentioned. The really dangerous American fascists are not those who are hooked up directly or indirectly with the Axis. The FBI has its finger on those. The dangerous American fascist is the man who wants to do in the United States in an American way what Hitler did in Germany in a Prussian way. The American fascist would prefer not to use violence. His method is to poison the channels of public information. With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth to the public but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money or more power.\n \n If we define an American fascist as one who in case of conflict puts money and power ahead of human beings, then there are undoubtedly several million fascists in the United States. There are probably several hundred thousand if we narrow the definition to include only those who in their search for money and power are ruthless and deceitful. Most American fascists are enthusiastically supporting the war effort. They are doing this even in those cases where they hope to have profitable connections with German chemical firms after the war ends. They are patriotic in time of war because it is to their interest to be so, but in time of peace they follow power and the dollar wherever they may lead.\n \n American fascism will not be really dangerous until there is a purposeful coalition among the cartelists, the deliberate poisoners of public information, and those who stand for the K.K.K. type of demagoguery.\n \n The European brand of fascism will probably present its most serious postwar threat to us via Latin America. The effect of the war has been to raise the cost of living in most Latin American countries much faster than the wages of labor. The fascists in most Latin American countries tell the people that the reason their wages will not buy as much in the way of goods is because of Yankee imperialism. The fascists in Latin America learn to speak and act like natives. Our chemical and other manufacturing concerns are all too often ready to let the Germans have Latin American markets, provided the American companies can work out an arrangement which will enable them to charge high prices to the consumer inside the United States. Following this war, technology will have reached such a point that it will be possible for Germans, using South America as a base, to cause us much more difficulty in World War III than they did in World War II. The military and landowning cliques in many South American countries will find it attractive financially to work with German fascist concerns as well as expedient from the standpoint of temporary power politics.\n \n Fascism is a worldwide disease. Its greatest threat to the United States will come after the war, either via Latin America or within the United States itself.\n \n Still another danger is represented by those who, paying lip service to democracy and the common welfare, in their insatiable greed for money and the power which money gives, do not hesitate surreptitiously to evade the laws designed to safeguard the public from monopolistic extortion. American fascists of this stamp were clandestinely aligned with their German counterparts before the war, and are even now preparing to resume where they left off, after \"the present unpleasantness\" ceases:\n \n The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice. It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups. Likewise, many people whose patriotism is their proudest boast play Hitler's game by retailing distrust of our Allies and by giving currency to snide suspicions without foundation in fact.\n \n The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism. They cultivate hate and distrust of both Britain and Russia. They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.\n \n Several leaders of industry in this country who have gained a new vision of the meaning of opportunity through co-operation with government have warned the public openly that there are some selfish groups in industry who are willing to jeopardize the structure of American liberty to gain some temporary advantage. We all know the part that the cartels played in bringing Hitler to power, and the rule the giant German trusts have played in Nazi conquests. Monopolists who fear competition and who distrust democracy because it stands for equal opportunity would like to secure their position against small and energetic enterprise. In an effort to eliminate the possibility of any rival growing up, some monopolists would sacrifice democracy itself.\n \n It has been claimed at times that our modern age of technology facilitates dictatorship. What we must understand is that the industries, processes, and inventions created by modern science can be used either to subjugate or liberate. The choice is up to us. The myth of fascist efficiency has deluded many people. It was Mussolini's vaunted claim that he \"made the trains run on time.\" In the end, however, he brought to the Italian people impoverishment and defeat. It was Hitler's claim that he eliminated all unemployment in Germany. Neither is there unemployment in a prison camp.\n \n Democracy to crush fascism internally must demonstrate its capacity to \"make the trains run on time.\" It must develop the ability to keep people fully employed and at the same time balance the budget. It must put human beings first and dollars second. It must appeal to reason and decency and not to violence and deceit. We must not tolerate oppressive government or industrial oligarchy in the form of monopolies and cartels. As long as scientific research and inventive ingenuity outran our ability to devise social mechanisms to raise the living standards of the people, we may expect the liberal potential of the United States to increase. If this liberal potential is properly channeled, we may expect the area of freedom of the United States to increase. The problem is to spend up our rate of social invention in the service of the welfare of all the people.\n \n The worldwide, agelong struggle between fascism and democracy will not stop when the fighting ends in Germany and Japan. Democracy can win the peace only if it does two things:\n \n Speeds up the rate of political and economic inventions so that both production and, especially, distribution can match in their power and practical effect on the daily life of the common man the immense and growing volume of scientific research, mechanical invention and management technique. Vivifies with the greatest intensity the spiritual processes which are both the foundation and the very essence of democracy.\n \n The moral and spiritual aspects of both personal and international relationships have a practical bearing which so-called practical men deny. This dullness of vision regarding the importance of the general welfare to the individual is the measure of the failure of our schools and churches to teach the spiritual significance of genuine democracy. Until democracy in effective enthusiastic action fills the vacuum created by the power of modern inventions, we may expect the fascists to increase in power after the war both in the United States and in the world.\n \n Fascism in the postwar inevitably will push steadily for Anglo-Saxon imperialism and eventually for war with Russia. Already American fascists are talking and writing about this conflict and using it as an excuse for their internal hatreds and intolerances toward certain races, creeds and classes.\n \n It should also be evident that exhibitions of the native brand of fascism are not confined to any single section, class or religion. Happily, it can be said that as yet fascism has not captured a predominant place in the outlook of any American section, class or religion. It may be encountered in Wall Street, Main Street or Tobacco Road. Some even suspect that they can detect incipient traces of it along the Potomac. It is an infectious disease, and we must all be on our guard against intolerance, bigotry and the pretension of invidious distinction. But if we put our trust in the common sense of common men and \"with malice toward none and charity for all\" go forward on the great adventure of making political, economic and social democracy a practical reality, we shall not fail.\n \n -------",

   "I don't see how people think that the US (particularly the Bush administration) is leaning towards facism. Sit back for a second and consider what life would have been like in Nazi Germany, or Soviet Russia. Maybe do some research about what those societies were like. Then compare them to modern day America. We're living in a relative paradise, people. You're not being oppressed, you're not being subjugated. Want proof? Think about what you're doing right now. You're attacking the American government, ridiculing it's leadership...but you're still free, no? No one is going to come and arrest you as a political prisoner. No one is going to knee-cap you for saying you hate George W Bush. And I'll bet the next thing you'll do is respond to what I'm writing, or what others have written, and you'll blast whatever makes you feel good right now, but you'll be entirely free to do that.",

   "That is possibly the most ridiculous statement I have heard from you yet.\n \n A quick look at the definition of fascism will show that it is not the path of the USA.\n \n \n Neither the Republican nor the Democratic party proposes a dictatorial leader.\n Nation and race are not exalted above the individual.\n Forcible suppression of the opposition is not a policy.\n \n Show me some examples indicative of a firm fascist grip on America.\n\n \n And this may be the most ignorant thing I have ever heard you say. I assume you are referring to dictatorial fascim, and likely pulled your definition of fascism out of a dictionary. In college, I took a class that was soley devoted to fascim. I took two semesters of it, and the entire course was basically devoted to defining fascism through study of historical fascist regimes. \n \n Look at what happened to those who opposed the Iraqi war at the outset. Charachter assasination is a light word for it. This is the same thing that has happend to memebers of Bushs staff who have jumped ship.\n \n The American government has systematically used either real or imagined enemies in order to promote and implement ever more restrictive laws on the American people.\n \n Some direct examples. The supreme court is right now preparing to rule on a case that will effect all Americans. Basically, the question is, can you be required to show ID to a police officer if you are not under arrest or under direct suspicion of a crime. 99 out of 100 constitutional scholars wil tell you NO. The supreme court is expected to rule YES.\n \n Right now, there are American citizens in a military prison, on US soil, who have been denied their rights in the name of national security.\n \n When they passed the NFA (national firearms act) they passed it as a tax measure, because it was generally accepted that passing a prohibition on things ike machine guns, hand grenades, flame throwers, artillery pieces, would be unconstitutional. Today it is illegal to manufature a semiautomatic firearm with a bayonet lug, a flash supressor, and a pistol grip.\n \n Control of the media? You have got to be kidding me. Do you ever watch any international news channels, or do you just rely on whatever comes in on cable? You are missing a LOT, my friend.\n \n You need to update your definition of \"fascim\". I would recommend a book called \"A difinitive study of Fascism and Fascist Governments\" I can not think of the author off the top of my head, but can dig it up if you need. It is about 600 pages and well worth the read. IT does not put forth the theory that the US has slowly becoma a fascist state, but by the end of the book, you will find yourself defending and making excuses for the US in your head. It is one of those \"change your life\" books. It is basically just a book on fascism, but as far as I know it is one of the most in depth studies on the subject. \n \n Once you really understand how fascist government operate, the tactics they use, and the logic behind those tactics, you will see the US in a new light, I can almot promise you that. Looking back ont he history of the US, you can very nearly pinpoint exactly when fascism started to get a grip o the country (it was following WWII).",

   "I suppose the redefining of a long standing word is necessary to support your argument...much as is Kerry's attempt to redefine the misery factor.\n\n \n No, just using a valid definition. For example, America, Iran, and Great Britain are all democratic countries. They are not the same. Cuba, the Soviet Union and Sweden are/were all socialist countries. IT would be a real stretch to try to claim they are the same.\n \n Defining any political system in a few sentences is an exercise in futility, so we tend to used canned definitions, usually based on the most extreme example of that particular sytem that we can find. Just as Sweden is incomparable to the Soviet Union, America is not really comparable to the Nazis, though in the first example both states are socialist, and in the second, both states are fascist.\n \n Sglaine is on the right track, though I would say \"A Kawasaki is not a Harley\" While they both perform the same function, are both operated in the same manner, and may appear the same to one who knows little or nothing about motorcycles, I could fill a page with the differences between them. If you call a Harley a Kawasaki, there is a beter than average chance that the owner will be offended, an possible correct you loudly. At the end of the day, they are both motorcyles.\n \n I will dig up that book (it is up in the attic with my other college stuff) in the next couple of days. I will even send it to you if you would like, I am done with it. The first sentence in the book is (I have used the quote frequently) \"Fascism is inarguably the most vile creation in the history of mankind\". I think it would be difficult to class the author as a fascist. \n \n Besides, it is unlikely you would find a true fascist writing a book about fascim. The greatest tool of fascism is secrecy. Nobody knows what is going on until it is too late. Writing a book that exposes the intricies of fascism would be counter to the methodology employed to impliment fascism.",

I don't think they are any more fascist than the Liberals we have in power. While, in theory, socialism and fascism are mutually exclusive goals, realistically in a socialist system fascism seems to be relevant, they simply change the tune a little bit. Instead of openly celebating the state, they use \"The people\" who are represented by the state to justify their fascist activities. You cannot create a nanny state without some fascist elements.

They want this for different ends, but the practical goals (as opposed to the stated goals) of both parties seem to be the same.\n \n You don't have to force people if you can trick them. \n \n \nGo back to school.\n\n \n Don't need to. Already have 2 degrees, and neither one of them does me any good. While my poli sci degree does prove useful on occasion (particularly what I learned about media and public relations) it was probably not worth what it cost (financially). Physics (my other degree) is an interesting field and I enjoyed the coursework, but I am not a physicist, so the degree is pretty much a dust shelf on my wall. What would you suggest I study this time around (if I actually had time to go back to school)?\n \n \nAmerica is basically a two party system due to the relative strengths of two of the MANY parties we have. The Repubs and the Dems share control with a bit of influence from the Libertarian, Green and other weak parties. If you need a list of them I'll be glad to get one posted.\n\n \n Thanks, I have a list. In nazi German, there were NINE political parties. In the Soviet union there were over a dozen at one point. It is not the relative strengths of the two viable parties in the US that keep them in power. It is largly the electoral system and the fact that in many locations, these two parties have worked to ensure their dominance through such measures as limiting ballot access. As the legal scholar Alexander Bickel put it, \"The choice in the general election between two candidates either of whom can satisfy most people, or at least radically dissatisfy very few, always leaves some of us with no choice at all.\" \n \n There has been widespread support in AMerica for some time for a viable third party. Currently, over 30% of Americans are not registered as republicans OR democrats. The problem is, the pearl of the political parties is the presidency. That is the ultimate goal, and with a run at the presidency being unrealistic for a third party, voting independant is seen as throwing away your vote.",

I disagree with much of liberal ideology, and some conservative ideology. I'd never go without either, however.

   "Ghost blaaa blaaaa blaaaa Bush poll ratings went down today he lost 10% In my state. Bush is going down.\n\n \n I don't know that having Kerry in the white house is likely to be any better. AS much as I dislike Bush, he seems to be the lesser of two evils this time around. It would be nice if we had a decent 3rd party canidate, or a \"none of the above\" option on the ballot. \n \n Since this is the fascim thread, I will tell yu what bothers me the most about the propspect of having a democrat int he white house. THe problem I se with it is the patriot act. Ashcroft promised not to misuse it, and he seems to be holding up to that. There have not been any reported abuses of the patriot act that I have heard of. I think that, although I have some pretty mixed feelings about Ashcroft, he has kept his word about not abusing the act or allowing others to.\n \n I don't think we sould see the same restraint if htere was a democrat in the white house and a democrat heading the justice department. During the Clinton administration, we saw ruby ridge, waco, and dozens of other less publicised seiges. We saw machine gun weilding federal agents serving a custoday order. Give a democrat control of the justice department before the patriot act expires r is repealed, and you are giving them WAY more power than I think they can handle. Ashcroft has demonstrated on several occasions that the individual rights of the AMerican people are pretty high on his list. I have yet to see any democrat, much less any of the liberal democrats kerry sems to like to run with, express similar priorities.\n \n Of course, that said, it seems like this country is pretty screwed up, and I think people need to wake up. I think a political revolution is needed to set things straight. I cannot remember right now who said \"Nothing un-American can survive in the light\" but whoever it was, they were rigth. WE need to find politicians who will do more things out in the open and do less back room dealing.\n \n To those ends, perhaps it would be best to elect Kerry, since I think he would be a worse choice than bush. MAybe we should all vote for the worst guy we can find, because the AMeircan people seem to be pretty good about closing their eyes really tight and hoping that the moster won't eat them. I think things will have to get pretty bad in this country before enough people take enough of an interest to get anything done.\n \n Who are the communists running this time around? Maybe we should all vote for him. Or what about that felon in Kentucky who always runs from prison (s he can pardon himself if he wins). Maybe we should just pick some random guy off the street.",

Efforts people make to some degree will reflect their group interests. For example, if you live in Utah, plan on celebrating the 24th of July, the day the Mormons first arrived in the Salt Lake Valley. Anywhere else, this holiday is not recognized. Here in California, we celebrate Caesar Chavez day and cancel school. Many Americans don't even know who he is. Both of these holidays reflect religious or ethnic interests of certain groups. There is no conspiracy here. People just naturally tend support the interests of their group, especially if it is a small minority. It's not a bad thing, and we shouldn't close our eyes about it.",
