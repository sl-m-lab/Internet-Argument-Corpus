   "A tourist says he was traumatized when Las Vegas police threatened to arrest him after he complained about an act of prostitution in his hotel room....\n \n He said that the next morning, he called Las Vegas Exclusive Personals to demand his money back, saying he was dissatisfied because the entertainer didn't stay for the promised one hour and left after a half hour.\n \n Blackman said he also told the company he was incapable of making an informed agreement with the stripper because he was drunk at the time.\n \n Dissatisfied when Las Vegas Exclusive Personals didn't arrange for a refund, Blackman said he contacted Metro Police and was told he faced arrest for such conduct and was advised to contact the Better Business Bureau.\n \n Instead, after returning home he filed suit in federal court in New York, charging \"An escort did an illegal sexual act on me during her paid service to me'' and \"I almost had gotten arrested.\"\n \n Blackman said he now needs medical treatment for a mental condition related to the incident.\n\n Las Vegas tourist sues for refund after sex act led to &#39;tragic&#39; arrest threat - Thursday, Jan. 20, 2011 | 4:29 p.m. - Las Vegas Sun\n \n LOL!",
