   "That article has issues. \n \n \nAnd it seems that the Left is its own worst enemy. NARAL's \"Generation\n Pro-Choice\" is dying because liberals are birthing fewer children.\n\n \n Factless asseration. Not to mention that voting is not dependent purely upon what family you grew up in, it depends heavily on education. \n \n \nOverall, the fertility rate in Kerry states is\n around 12 percent lower than in Bush states. The Economist reports that in\n the ultra-liberal state of Vermont, the annual fertility rate is 49 children\n for every 1,000 women of childbearing age. But in the heavily pro-Bush state\n of Utah, nearly twice as many children per 1,000 child-bearing-aged women\n are being born. Of every 1,000 Utah women, 91 children are born.\n\n \n Fallacy: least plausible hypothesis. Utah is known for its aversion to concreceptives, and has far less support for planned parenthood and other such agencies. Not to mention that there could be a number of other reasons, such as age of marriage, percentage of women in full time jobs, avaliablity of adoption, plenty of other alternatives as to why that is occuring. \n \n \nAbortion has much more to do with the fertility rates amongst liberals. Of the twenty states with the lowest abortion rates according to the Centers\n for Disease Control, only Maryland, Maine, and Wisconsin voted for Kerry. Of\n the ten states with the highest abortion rates, only Florida, Kansas, and\n Virginia voted for Bush.\n\n \n Again least plausible hypothesis. It is a known fact that the percentage of democratic leaning voters in the north east and on the west coast. Of course states that have a higher percentage of republican voters will be voting republican, that hasn't changes since abortion was allowed on a national level. Also, it ignores other reasons for voting, this past election saw a large number of party members vote the other way for a number of reasons. Republicans voting Democrat because Bush went partial socialist and he screwed the occupation up. Democrats went Republican (not entirely sure why), like Sen. Zell. \n \n \nStates that voted most overwhelmingly for Kerry tend to be ranked among the highest abortion rates. Kerry's most impressive lead over Bush was in theDistrict of Columbia where he scored 90 percent. The District also has the nation's highest annual abortion rate at 46 abortions per 1,000 women of\n childbearing age. Of the nine states with the lowest abortion rates - Idaho,\n Colorado, Kentucky, South Dakota, Mississippi, West Virginia, Utah,\n Missouri, and South Carolina - the average winning percentage for Bush was\n nearly 60 percent. Similar trends were projected by Planned Parenthood's\n think tank, the Alan Guttmacher Institute, after the 2000 election.\n\n \n Again, ignoring the obvious answer: voting deals with education. The states named that voted for Bush have on general, lower then average public schools. That merely doesn't mean they are dumber, but less informed. Many of these people in the Bush voting states are likely to be suprised that Bush is not what they bargained for, a big liberal government spender who enacts rights restricting laws. It's not inherently abortion, but education. \n \n \n18,336,576 would have been at least 18-years old on\n November 2. John Kerry lost the popular vote by only 3,461,992 ballots.\n Kerry could have used another 18 million votes - five times his margin of\n defeat. That isn't to say that all 18 million citizens would have voted for\n Kerry, or voted at all, but given the power of parental influence the\n chances are likely that these aborted Americans would have been a major\n Democrat constituency.\n\n \n that assumes quite a lot. It assumes that with high rates of teenage accidents and deaths, that the same number would have been around to vote. Not to mention that it assumes that education again plays no part in voting. \n \n While it does give a decent argument as to why it is occuring, and he's likely on to something, the argument makes big assumptions, also if we look across the pond, why is the exact opposite occuring in very liberal nations who favor abortion, instead of more \"conservative\" (most people don't know what that means at all), they are becomming more liberal.",
