   "Quick synopsis: A couple was expecting their second child. They discovered it had a rare developmental disorder which would have prevented any chance of survival. They had to make the difficult decision to terminate the pregnancy (a friend of mine had a similar scenario which I posted a thread on a while back). When they arrived at the clinic, they were shouted at and berated by protestors. While his wife went into surgery, the husband grabbed his cellphone and recorded his confrontation with the protestors.\n \n Here's the link (with video).\n \n Confronting Life ?

So just from the video I'd say the guy was being a jerk.\n\n \n Well, I didn't see them deny what he confronted them about. In fact, one of the woman apologized, so basically, she admitted it was true that they were yelling at women entering the clinic.\n \n Besides, considering what he was going through I'd hardly call that being a jerk. But you don't sound very empathetic to anything the couple was going through, yourself.\n \n Don't you have any life experience?\n \n IMO, he was very rational, under the circumstances. Everything he said was quite logical, including the term \"low lifes.\"",
