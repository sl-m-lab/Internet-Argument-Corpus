   "I know it's a ways off, but who do yall think will run in 2008? There are already some people gearing up for it (ie. Frist, Clinton), but who else?\n \n You think John McCain will try to run? Will he be done with politics by then? If he were to become president, he'd be the even older than Reagan was when he was elected.\n \n I'm relatively liberal and have (often to my dismay, but for lack of a better choice) voted solidly democratic, but if John McCain were to run, I'd have to seriously consider voting for him. He is a moderate (a moderate in the true sense of the word, not people like Frist and Clinton who swerve to the center when it's convenient), he's not afraid to go against the party line or the president when he feels it is what is right. He criticizes when he knows it's right. In short, he has integrity. In fact, I think he has more integrity than any politician on the federal level right now. I think that is something we need returned to the White House.\n \n Sadly, if John McCain were to choose to run, the GOP wouldn't have the sense to elect him. Why wouldn't they? He's not on their leash. Why would it be stupid to not run him? Because he'd win in a landslide. Pretty much every republican would vote for him because the only alternative would be voting for a democrat, and I know they wouldn't do that. Most independents would vote for him because most independents are moderates. On top of everything else, he'd win over more than a handful of democrats like me.\n \n What are your thoughts on who will run? Who do you think should run or would like to see run? What are your thoughts on McCain?",

It was like 50,49,1 (1 for Nader).\n Anyway, something I heard was that Hilary Clinton would run, and I heard that John Edwards was going to try and run again. :) \n Republicans will probibly have Chaney and I also heard Condalisa Rice and one point.\n Nader will probibly run on the third party. (It would be interesting if he actually did win so we would finally realize that there are more parties than Dem/Rep.\n\n Ohhhhhhhhh Boy, John Edwards, AKA Breck Girl!!!",

   "I went to the polls in the last election with the knowledge that John Kerry or George Bush would be next to lead and represent the United States. My thought (which has not changed) was that if these two were our best, then we are in deep, deep trouble. Candidates will soon start positioning for their run and I keep hoping that one capable individual will rise from the crowd. I don't care if He/She is an \"R\" or a \"D\" as long as the real problems are addressed and workable, long term solutions are put forth. This will require a leader, a statesman the likes of which we have not seen for a long while. Scanning the current crop of potential candidates does not inspire optimism.\n Dono",
