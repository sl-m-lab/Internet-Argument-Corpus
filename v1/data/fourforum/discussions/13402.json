   "GOP leaders, in a private meeting last month, delivered a blunt and at times heated message to RNC Chairman Michael Steele: quit meddling in policy.\n \n The plea was made during what was supposed to be a routine discussion about polling matters and other priorities in House Minority Leader John Boehner's office. But the session devolved into a heated discussion about the roles of congressional leadership and Steele, according to multiple people familiar with the meeting.\n \n The congressional leaders were particularly miffed that Steele had in late August unveiled a seniors' \"health care bill of rights\" without consulting with them. The statement of health care principles, outlined in a Washington Post op-ed, began with a robust defense of Medicare that puzzled some in a party not known for its attachment to entitlements.\n\n Read more: GOP leaders to Michael Steele: Back off - Manu Raju and Jonathan Martin - POLITICO.com\n \n So the GOP wanted a figurehead when the elected Steele.\n That makes more sense... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nAlexander said the \"point\" of the discussion was that the GOP leaders should be the ones driving the policy.\n \n The discussion, sources said, did not touch on the merits of the \"health care bill of rights\" - just on whether it should have been coming out of the RNC.\n \n \"We are elected to set the policy,\" Alexander said. \"But in my view, the national committee's job is to create the environment in which Republicans can be elected to set policy. Michael Steele said that was exactly his point of view, so I think we see eye to eye on it.\"\n \n Asked if the conversation was heated, Alexander said: \"It was a good discussion. Both of us are grown-ups and are experienced in politics, and I don't think either one of us has thought very much about it.\"\n \n RNC officials declined to make Steele available for an interview.\n\n Wow.\n \"RNC officials declined to make Steele available for an interview\"\n emoticon_rolleyes",
