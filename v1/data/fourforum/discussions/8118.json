Here are the reasons and thoughts I have on this:\n \n a.) they DO fight for other issues, just in different ways. They may fight against, say, alcoholism through PR, and homosexuality via legislation. They also fight against other \"sins\" via legislation; e.g. they often push ballot initiatives on gambling and casinos opening and so forth. They DID fight alcohol via legislation too; but it got repealed in the 21st amendment so it didn't stick.\n \n b.) I suspect they really do feel, in some cases, that homosexuality is a greater threat than the other \"sins\" they could be fighting against.\n \n c.) If they fought tolerance toward other religions (the one example you wanted to stick to the most) as much as homosexuality, they would run the risk of legislating themselves right out of religious freedom, since their own ability to carry out their religion is allowed by that freedom.",

   "Pot, meet Mr. Kettle.\n\n What argument of yours have I misrepresented?\n \n \n \n1) I wasn't claiming that the AFA was opposed to gambling and alcoholism because of secular reasons.\n I'm saying that it's COMMON SENSE for opposition towards those ideas.\n\n \nSo you think the AFA is opposing those based on common sense?\n\n emoticon_xdonno emoticon_xdonno emoticon_xdonno \n :xbanghead :xbanghead :xbanghead \n \n \n \nNo one ever said religious opposition to something had to be Biblically based. The thing that makes it their actions religiously motivated is that it comes out of their religious beliefs.\n\n And WHERE do their religious beliefs come from???\n The BIBLE!\n \n If you want to show a DIFFERENT origin for this thing you claim as a \"religious belief\", then I recommend you CITE THE SOURCE...\n \n \n \n(Yes, there ARE passages that can be used to support the idea that drunkenness is wrong, and throwing money on games of chance is wrong.) MANY things that fundie groups have done over time have not been based on scripture. Nevertheless, it was from their religious beliefs, which is what makes it religiously-motivated.\n\n Can you show how this is their \"religious belief\" in the first place?\n \n \n \nGive that man a silver star . . . Foundit's finally starting to get it!! emoticon_xgood \n\n I \"got\" new information that you just gave for the first time?\n Yeah. Wow. Imagine that!\n \n \n \nSo you think they are motivated by common sense and not their religious beliefs???\n\n So you think they are motivated by their religious beliefs and not their common sense???\n \n \n \nCome on Foundit. I KNOW you aren't this dense. I said the AFA came out of that line of thinking.\n\n 1) Yes. You \"said\" that but in no way substantiated it...\n 2) The MAIN POINT of that line of thinking was 'prohibition'.\n Yet they abandoned the MAIN POINT?\n \n It's like saying somebody is a Christian, but they don't believe in Jesus Christ...\n \n \n \nI have NO DOUBT that if the AFA had been around in the 1920s, they would have supported (and fought hard for) prohibition. Just like the SBC, the Women's Teperance Movement, the Anti-Saloon League, and many others did at the time.\n\n Actually, I think if the AFA had been around in the 1920's, they would be trying to put down the black man and suppress the women's movement.\n \n Isn't speculation fun!\n \n \n \nNo, no, no! Not the historical occurances, the ideology that came out it!! I honestly thought you understood fundamentalism better than this.\n\n Jyoshu. I understand a LOT about \"fundamentalism\".\n I don't understand the ever-evolving story of YOUR THOUGHTS on 'fundamentalism' and how things co-relate amongst fundamentalists...\n \n YOU are claiming things about the *basis* of the AFA which I haven't seen you claim before.\n It's YOUR OPINION which is undergoing \"understanding\".\n Not knowledge on \"fundamentalism\"...\n \n \n \nI think fundamentalist groups DO think alike in many ways. There's a reason they share the moniker \"fundamentalist.\"\n\n :xbanghead :xbanghead :xbanghead \n ROFLMAO!\n \n Main Entry: fun&#183;da&#183;men&#183;tal&#183;ism \n Pronunciation: -t&l-\"i-z&m\n Function: noun\n 1 a often capitalized : a movement in 20th century Protestantism emphasizing the literally interpreted Bible as fundamental to Christian life and teaching b : the beliefs of this movement c : adherence to such beliefs\n 2 : a movement or attitude stressing strict and literal adherence to a set of basic principles\n \n THAT is why things are called \"fundamentalist\".\n There are fundamentalists on BOTH sides of the aisle, often OPPOSING each other.\n Perhaps you can explain how fundamentalist groups which are in DIRECT OPPOSITION of one another are \"thinking alike\"...\n \n \n \nI've answered this already, but I'll do it again here, mainly so you won't get away with lying and say that I'm avoiding your question. Here are the reasons and thoughts I have on this:\n \n a.) they DO fight for other issues, just in different ways. They may fight against, say, alcoholism through PR, and homosexuality via legislation. They also fight against other \"sins\" via legislation; e.g. they often push ballot initiatives on gambling and casinos opening and so forth. They DID fight alcohol via legislation too; but it got repealed in the 21st amendment so it didn't stick.\n \n b.) I suspect they really do feel, in some cases, that homosexuality is a greater threat than the other \"sins\" they could be fighting against.\n \n c.) If they fought tolerance toward other religions (the one example you wanted to stick to the most) as much as homosexuality, they would run the risk of legislating themselves right out of religious freedom, since their own ability to carry out their religion is allowed by that freedom.\n\n 1) This is the first time I've asked this DIRECT question, so you're claim that you've answered it before is rather baffling. But to address your responses...\n \n a) IS NOT a response to my question at all. It's more of an attempt to argue by side-stepping the question...\n \n b) \"greater threat\"? How does fighting to fire a gay person just because he is gay fight against a \"greater threat\"?\n Does the act of firing a gay man somehow make things less \"threatened\"? What is being \"threatened\" by employing a gay man?\n Are they that scared of gays?\n \n c) Ahh. So it's selfish preservation then? A desire to prevent fighting on an issue which could negatively impact THEM, so they pick and choose issues which may not negatively impact THEM?\n \n But that still makes no sense. Because virtually EVERYBODY has a sexual orientation. The legislation which says \"You can't fire Carl because he's gay\" also says \"You can't fire Cathy because she's straight\". Both gay AND straight are protected.\n \n So they don't fight for the right to fire a Muslim because he's Muslim, because they're afraid of being fired for being Christian...\n But they do fight for the right to fire a homosexual because he's homosexual, ignoring the fact that they are also setting up the possibility of firing heterosexuals because they're straight?\n \n Sigh. I guess one of my point all along has been that bigotted Christians are irrationale... You just helped to prove that...",

   "I did already: the historical movement called the Holiness Movement that began in the 19th century, that you acted as if had no bearing here when it's exactly the \"source\" you're wanting.\n\n Jyoshu, there WAS a movement in the 19TH CENTURY which you are describing...\n THEN you turn around and claim it is related to the phenomenon we are seeing today. You claimed it was a BASIS FOR the AFA's action.\n \n The point is that while this other movement exist, there is NO REASON to believe it is in any way to claim it is related to the AFA other than your claims. Even your reference doesn't claim a link.\n \n \n \nI find this very interesting. It seems that you're so determined to defend your POV that your actually defending fundamentalism here by arguing that their beliefs HAVE to come from the Bible.\n\n You know, in another thread you complain that you get tired of arguing over what \"is\" means...\n ... when the truth is that you can't even be bothered to accurately portray your opponent's position, and it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with what \"is\" means.\n \n 1) I am not defending fundamentalism.\n 2) I am not saying that their beliefs HAVE to come from the Bible.\n 3) I am saying that their Christian RELIGIOUS beliefs have to come from the bible, or some other VERIFIABLE religious source.\n Just claiming *Oh, the AFA has a basis coming from this 19th century movement.*, and then doing absolutely nothing to show why that claim is true, just doesn't cut muster.\n \n \n \nIf you really knew so much about fundamentalism as you say you do, you'd know that much of what fundamentalism champions isn't really all that Biblical.\n\n Actually, a LOT of it is DERIVED from arbitrary INTERPRETATIONS of the bible. Even the racists claim a religious basis for their prejudice against blacks and their desire for segregation.\n \n I'ld be curious if you could show me a Christian \"fundamentalist\" cause which has absolutely no origin in the Bible. Of course, such a challenge would have to include proof of why you would claim it as a \"Christian 'fundamentalist' cause\" in the first place...\n \n \n \nBut that doesn't mean it's not a religious belief. Do you think, for instance, that the Bible says a person can't drink wine? Quite a few fundies have the religious belief that drinking wine is wrong. Yet, Jesus drank wine.\n\n Christianity, and the Bible, have a particularly fun habit of myopically focusing on one detail to justify whatever they like. And the Bible is so contradictory and full of a wide spectrum of interpretative capability that such things are frequent.\n \n In high school, I was actually taught by somebody from that Christian religious belief. So to answer your question, I did know that. One of the other members of the class asked her what she used in communion, and she answered grape juice...\n \n \n \nCatholics hold to the idea that they should pray to the virgin Mary. But that's not in the Bible either. Just because it's not directly found in the Bible doesn't mean it's not religious belief.\n\n LOL. The catholics hold great exception to your claim of \"that's not in the bible either\". I was in a discussion with a catholic on another message board where she was asked about the whole \"Mary\" thing and the basis for it. She gave a variety of Bible verses to support the religious position.\n And yes. Some of them were stretched pretty far on the \"interpretation\" scale. But the point being that there was SOME biblical basis given.\n \n Did you think that Catholics had no biblical basis for their beliefs and practices on Mary?\n \n \n \nBecause they say it is, and they believe it from a religious POV. That's all the criteria they need.\n\n And can you quote them on them saying that?\n \n \n \nBingo. That's right. It's NOT common sense to want gays to be fired from jobs for no good reason, is it? It's NOT common sense to want beer selling and buying completely outlawed, is it?\n\n I feel like I'm resurrecting one of your tired ol' lines...\n But it's what they \"believe in\"...\n \n You and I think it's not common sense, but YOU YOURSELF have argued that they see gays as a threat. It may not be common sense to you or I, but do you really think they sit around thinking, \"Well, this religious belief I have contradicts common sense, but I believe in it anyways...\"\n \n \n \nLOL, you have no idea how much that actually happens.\n\n Seriously. If you have an example of that, I would love to see it. That WOULD be a new piece of information / data that I haven't come across before...\n Regarding: \"It's like saying somebody is a Christian, but they don't believe in Jesus Christ...\"\n \n \n \nMaybe the black man, but I doubt the women's movement. Feminism and fundamentalists were actually allied to an extent in the early part of this century.\n\n An anti-feminist fundamentalist could easily pick on some bible verses to extoll the \"place\" of a woman...\n \n 1Timothy 2:11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. \n 1Timothy 2:12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. \n 1Timothy 2:13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve. \n 1Timothy 2:14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. \n 1Timothy 2:15 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.\n \n Quite explicitly falling in step against the feminist equality ideology.\n \n \n \nJust becaue you haven't seen me claim it before doesn't mean it's anything new for me.\n\n This comment makes no sense in the context of our discussion.\n You were criticizing me for my lack of knowledge of fundamentalism, and I was pointing out that it wasn't \"knowledge\" of the subject I lacked, but knowledge of how YOU PERCEIVED it that was *lacking*.\n \n And then you replied with the above...\n \n \n \nAnd based on your comments here, I don't think you know much about fundamentalism at all, such as your comment: \"fountit66\n \"Perhaps you can explain how fundamentalist groups which are in DIRECT OPPOSITION of one another are \"thinking alike\"...\"\"\n\n You assume too much.\n I understand how fundamentalist groups have some commonality at their VERY CORE. But this commonality hardly leads one to the statements that you were making, unless you were applying one of the loosest standards I have ever seen.\n \n Regardless, you predictably avoided an answer...\n \n \n If you don't think there are traits that fundamentalists have in common, then I don't know what else to say. \n \n \n \n \nIt's in fact to show you that they DON'T just fight against homoseuxality; a point you've basically ignored or refused to accept.\n\n My GAWD you're dense!\n I acknowledge that each time I talk about how they are focusing MORE on homosexuality than on other issues. Ergo, acknowledging they have SOME focus on other issues, but MORE on homosexuality.\n I NEVER CLAIMED that they fight \"just\" against homosexuality.\n \n \n \nI think they probably are 'scared of gays'. It's called being \"homophobic\". \n\n The term \"phobia\", when used as a suffix, has two potential meanings.\n (www.m-w.com -phobia)\n 1 : exaggerated fear of <acrophobia<\n 2 : intolerance or aversion for <photophobia<\n \n \n \nI don't think they either see it that way, or realize that.\n\n I think for the primary reason that they don't need to. And they don't need to because of the same blinders that you often have on.\n We live in a heterosexual world. Assumed heterosexual until judged otherwise, or you out yourself otherwise. When people say that they are \"married\", they assume heterosexually. If they see a wedding band, they assume the spouse is the opposite gender.\n \n The idea of such discrimination is alien to them. And to the greater degree, with good reason. Gays just don't work that way against straights...\n \n \n \nI have no disagreement with you that bigotted Christians are irrational. I have no disagreement that Christians period can be irrational. What I don't agree (because you haven't proven it) is that opposition to homosexuality is all bigotry to begin with. In SOME cases, it may be.\n\n Like I have stated in the past, I see discrimination against gays in preventing equality to be a defining issue for \"bigotry\".\n And I find your \"you haven't proven it\" statement to be funny, because classifications such as \"bigotry\" are purely arbitrary. You'ld obviously hold serious contention with Matthew's classifications of \"bigotry\".\n How the heck could I \"prove\" the classification of a word with such wide connotations?\n \n \n \nWhy don't you start by proving the bigotry before expecting everyone else to disprove what you haven't even proven to begin with?\n\n I've stated over and over again my definition for \"bigotry\". It's not something you can \"prove\". My definition of \"bigotry\" is going to differ from Steeeve's and yours and Matthews. There is nothing that can be \"proven\" when it comes to classifying this...\n \n If you have disagreement with my definition, explicitly state what it is.\n Quite frankly, I don't think I have EVER seen you state your definition of \"bigotry\", although I could be wrong.\n \n Have you?",
