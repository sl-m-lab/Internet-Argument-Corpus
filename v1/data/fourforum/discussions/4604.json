But he was so desperate to prove that the UK is not a declining power on the World stage that he threw his lot in with Bush.\n\n \n I think this is exactly right. Many of the British seem to hold the delusion that they are a superpower. Sorry, the Us is the only superpower left (quickly being superseded by the Chinese), and an unlubed romantic interlude with the US in the form of your occasional war, does not bring back the British empire. \n \n The time will come when the British pay dearly for their lack of judgment in this regard. While there are currently some pretty decent perks to being a pet of the US, those perks are rapidly drying up as our economic system falters. I fail to see anything in the past that would suggest that the US would be likely to continue giving favors to the British if it proves detrimental to our own economic interests. To the contrary if we suddenly found it profitable to declare all British subjects are terrorists and bomb the entire island until nothing is left but a smoking crater, I seriously doubt we would have any reservations whatsoever to doing so, and properly presented tot he American people (wrapped in the flag and shown as a war of civilizations), the worst backlash we could really expect is some strongly worded letters to the opinion page of the local newspaper. And who really ready the opinion page anyway?\n \n If the British people were to take a really hard look at what has historically happened to us allies, I think they would think twice about their support, and very possibly form a pitchfork and torch carrying mob to remove Blair from power. \n \n At one time, Noriega was our closest ally in central America.\n We were assisting our ally ElSalvador when we started sending death squads \n Saddam was once our closest ally in the Middle east. He even fought a multi billion dollar war for us.\n Pinochet was our buddy.\n \n \n \nI believe Rumsfelds statements where not helpful at all, it seemed like he left diplomacy at the door in the rush to conflict.

I believe that the whole Iraq was a total failure in the diplomatic sense.\n\n \n I think that it has to be realized that when Rumsfeld made that statement, the Bush administration was doing everything possible to divert attention from the fact that this was an illegal war, and that their evidence for going to war was basically pathetic. \n \n Personally, I think that Germany and France are likely to be the predominate force in Europe in the medium and long term future. Not only do they seem to be the main thrust behind the EU, making them economic leaders, I believe they are also destined to be military leaders. Before anybody jumps down my throat on that one, I would urge you to take a look at the respective military situation in both countries. While Germany does not have much by way of equipment, they do have a LOT of folks running around with some pretty serious military training. France, on the other hand, has all kinds of equipment, but not nearly enough well trained people to operate it. I am seeing a connection here, especially in lieu of the fact that the Germans have increasingly been the driving force behind France.",

Or is it not true, too defamatory, not helpful, what?\n\n \n IMO, there is no truth to that statement. While the \"new europe\" have the potential to \"rock the boat\" so to speak, by shifting the ballance on certain issues, they are not a power factor in themselves. The baltic countries are for example quite likely to join the Finns, Swedes, Danes and Germans in securing funds for re-establishing the eco-system in the baltic sea. The poles are likely to challange the old CAP system due to their massive and in-efficient agricultural industry. \n \n The idea that power has been shifted eastward, from Brittain, to France and Germany has its merits. But not because of \"new europe\", but because of recent power plays by Blai, Chiraq and Schr\u00f6der. But perhaps one could make the argument that new europe has shifted power from France, to Germany, as Germany has once again become the centre of europe (instead of the fringe of western europe).",

High labor costs are being dealt with through expansion to nations with lower labor costs (eastern europe, ME, etc...).

Most of eastern europe is just happy to have the lights on and a low paying job so their children do not starve.\n \n \nbtw, the US as a declining superpower comment is amusing\n\n \n how so? Our economy is going in the toilet, we impose sanctions on other coutries and the europeans sign a big trade agreement with them the same week. Nobody on the planet is really willing to give us a second thought. Gone are the days when we could simply mandate the actions of other nations. Teh big challenge on teh horizon as far as exerting influence will be to keep the EU from diregarding arms sanctions against china, and frankly it looks like we are going to be unsucessful in that.",

Not scapegoating the Chinese eastern europeans or Indians, just stating what happens in an open market. When costs are cheaper somewhere else to make up for the moving of the factory, jobs are lost untill costs go down or the other country cost rise to meet or exceed the benifits of placing factories their. As Chinese, or Indian wages are 1/4 -1/8 for technical position that of Western countries, their costs have a long way to go up to meet ours. Comparative advantage is not working so well as infrustructure and education in those countries improve. The overall result will be an increase in their standard of living and a decline in the Wests to as a way to meet their cost of production.\n \n 2-3. France, Germany, and a couple other smaller countries either Denmark Belgium or Sweden are the largest net contributors to the EU, to the tune of 400-600 Euros per person after subsidies. So given the larger populations of France and Germany yes they are the main net funders to the EU, the UK also provides alot of funding but also recieve quite a bit back. (net funding of about 50 Euros. \n \n 4-5. While you dont have to be part of the EU to trade with it, there are advantages in being part of the EU for trading with the EU, first is the economic barriers that are removed for member states, which also provides an incentive for Western European countries to invest in the eastern countries for export to the west or to other eastern european countries. With out those advantages for the Eastern European countries (including the relative stabilty that being part of the EU provides) they would be in a weaker position when competing against China or India and the like. For Western Europe, I believe they may like to keep it trade more within the family so to speak.\n \n 6. The US though is losing market share, and increasing its oveall debt. During a time that some are saying are strong economic times for the US. The housing issue while a strength now during a low interest rate environment ( due mainly to Asia for both purchasing US debt and for competitive pressures) could easily in a few years be a strong negative as housing affordablitly is wiped out as interest rates continue to climb ( or as inflation starts a strong steady rise one of the two will occur if not both).\n \n Two questions about home ownership in the US, what is the debt to equity ratio for most home buyers? Second do Mobile homes count in that number and if so what is the percent of homeownership made up by mobil homes.\n \n The question about mobil homes is due to the fact that unlike traditional housing mobile homes are not traditionally an appreciating asset, which is the main benifit of home ownership.\n \n I do agree with being flexible with the federal deficit as a method to smooth out the economic cycle, so does the EU as France and Germany both have deficits of 3 % and have had them for a while. However the theory of using deficits to smooth out the economic cycle was supposed to involve paying down the debt and having a surplus during the good economic times. The problem arises when the deficits are a continuing item, during both good and bad years. At some point in time the debt servicing cost rise to an unaffordable level. In the early 90's roughly $0.30 of every tax dollar the Canadian government collected went to debt servicing, that is 30% that could have gone to the military or two tax reduction instead it went to foreign banks or domestic banks and did not help the Canadian economy one bit. Without changing that Canada could have very well suffered the same fate of Argentina in 1998. Which if the US continues on its high deficits both trade and federal is something similar to what could happen in the US. Within a few short years, many Argentinians went from being middle class for Argentina to being poor even for Argentina.\n \n Its government took on too much debt and could no longer afford to service its debts, it could have happened to Canada had we not been financially conservative over the last 10 years or so, it could happen to the US.",

   "Regarding contributtion.  \n Contribution is based on the size of the economy (which means that contribution per capita is based on GDP per capita). Real contribution (netcontribution) is slightly more complicated as it is based on a number of factors. As a rule of thumb, one could say that the more (un-competative) agricultural industries one country has, the more likely is that country to be a net-recipient of EU funds (the exeption being Ireland who are still cashing out huge checks). France is for example a net-recipient of EU funds. Germany is a huge net-payer. Due to their relative poornes in Poland, and huge inefficient agricultural industry, Poland is quite likely to become a net-reciever unless osmething dramatic is done to the CAP.\n \n Regarding decifit limits inside the Euro area.\n The decifit limits are geared towards limiting th debt-to-GDP ratio in medium term, that is, over the course of a bussiness cycle. While there are some problems with the limits due to inflexibility, they are being revised as we speak. To be honest, I think these limits are highly advantagous as it has been proven that it is rather hard to actually reduce indebtness without any external incentives or pressure. Especially with the parliamentary system we have in Europe.\n \n Regarding standard of living\n The US has always had a higher material standard of living than europe. A Part of it can be explained by longer work weeks in the US, and a part of it can be explained by higher productivity. This has been the case since the end of the world war II, and while Europe has been lagging the past decade, the gap between Europe and the US has steadily been shrinking. The more recent lagg can be explained by poor performance and financial crisises in Europe in the mid-ninetiees, a worsening demographic situation throughout europe and the German unification shock. While the US experienced very rapid growth due to the IT-\"revolution\".\n \n As for advantages of being part of EU\n For the eastern european countries, there are large benefits to be had from joining the EU in general, and the EMU in particular. At the moment, quite a few european economists are worried that eastern europe may suffer the same fate as the asian tigers as they are displaying similiar characteristics of rapid economic growth fueled by foreign investments, high interest rates and violative money markets. By joining the EMU, many believe they can avoid a financial crisis as well as increase overal trade between 5-30% (some economists have even claimed that the trade could increase with as much as 700%!..)\n \n As for capital flight from the old EU members, to the new EU members.\n EU, and EMU encourages capital transfers within EU. The capital flows between western europe and eastern europe suggest that \"old europe`s\" invetments in \"new europe\" is largely fueling the growth in these countries. The economic growth in eastern europe outside the EU collaboration is not very impressive. In the long run, this will lead to a convergance of living standards within EU. It will also serve to increase overall living standards due to a) specialisation, b) higher marginal product of capital and c) a larger inner market.",

LT, we have been over and over about the realestate market in the US. your concern about the housing bubble busting wyping out all the savings at the cost of debt will not happen to the degree to predict. i've lived through the oil bust in texas, and then the S&L bust a few years later. yes housing prices drop, and fortunes were lost, but guess what, texas economy recovered and now is humming along.\n\n \n The housing bubble is estimated at between 2 and 3 trillion dollars. That is far bigger than the S&L mess, the oil bust, or the .com bubble in terms of actualy dollars lost. The oil bust and the S&L mess look like nothing next to the housing bubble.\n \n \nand yes, it is actual house ownership, not condos or mobile homes. the vast majority of americans do not live in either.\n\n \n No, it is not.

What you need to foster growth is industrial expansion and/or increased industrial production. Most entrepreneurial startups are service sector, and while service sector is a great way to polish your GDP (which is how the US manages to have such a large GDP, despite the fact that we are buried in debt and have virtually no industrial infrastructure left), it has NOTHING to do with real growth. \n \n \nthe US deficit will be resolved before it will be a debilitating factor for the economy. and you do realize that there is power to having a trade deficit, correct? just as there is gains in a weak dollar.\n\n \n The US deficit will not be resolved. Sorry. If you actually look at bushs \"plan\", you will quickly realise that it is a crock. The only power that comes from running a trade deficit comes from being able to keep your creditors in line. I think that if you look at some of the statements being made by our creditor nations, especially comments coming out of asia, they are doine being held captive by the big IOU that we have outstanding with them. It wasn't that long ago that the japanese finance minister threatened to dump our bonds and crash our economy. Some power. We got right back in line.\n \n There are no gains to the current weak US dollar. What you want is an undervalued currency, not a weak one. The US dollar is NOT undervalued, it is just weak. If not for the fact that the petrodollar is still holding on, it would be a LOT weaker. Inflation inevitably follows a weak currency. While short term devaluation allows you to rid yourself of warhoused goods, if your currency does not recover, in the long term you will lamost certainly be destroyed. This is especially true in the US, where we import the vast majority of our materials and industrial equipment. We pay a higher value for those imports because fo the weak dollar, but stuill have to sell them competitively.",

   "1. housing bubble. no its much bigger than the S&L crisis, but you have missed the relative comparison of the economy of Texas vs that of the US.\n\n \n You seem to imply that texas is a closed economy? Or that there was not a fairly large federal bailout? That is the problem with situations like this on a national level, the federal government can't just drop a big bag of gold and make it go away because theya re hit as hard as anybody else in the form of declining revenues.\n \n \n2. the figures i am familiar with did not include the mobile homes. can you link me?\n\n \n Sure, any housing numbers. Mobile homes are classified as \"pre enginered\". The trick would be to find numbers that do NOt include them.\n \n \n3. about 30-40% of the economy remains non-corporate. but even in the corporate world entrepreneurship plays a role, look at eBay, Google, or even microsoft. they did not always have been and certainly did not spring out of thin air whole. in addition, when corporations expand, they frequently do so by buying up smaller competitors, those started by individuals. not just tech or biotech but also manufacturing as well.\n\n \n Microsoft is a good example. Google and Ebay are good examples of those \"serivce secotr\" businesses that make our GDP look pretty, but do nothing as far as building actual wealth. That is the problem wiht a \"service based\" economy. Since no tangible value is created, no national wealth is created. You are just shuffling money around. You and I could form our own country, sit on my couch and pass a $100 bill back and forth all day long for a year, and have an impressive GDP. We would still only have $100 between us. If we formed a governemtn, we would have less than that, since every transaction would require payment of tax.\n \n Microsoft is NOT a service based company (obvious to anybody who has worked with them....\"service\" is not in their vocabulary\". They are manufacturing and selling a tangible product. While certainly not your traditional industrial model, they are still without question an industrial enterprise. \n \n Entrepreneurship is certainly a good thing, but is pretty much neutral as far as real economic growth in our nation is concerned. A small manufaturing startup is simply not feasable in the US today. Our labor costs are too high and our material costs are too high. The \"china cost\" has killed us.\n \n \n \n4. the US deficit will resolve. and i never said it will be in the next three years.\n\n \n Are you talking spending deficit here? If so, what exactly is your thought process on this? With declining revenues due to the retirement of the baby boomers, as well as the reduction in industrial output, and record levels of unfunded federal obligations, exactly how do you see a resolution of our budgetary deficit on the horizon? Government spending has been going up since 1900. You really think that is going to change now?\n \n If you are talking trade deficit, that is just rediculous. \n \n \ntrade deficit: binds national interests. that is power.\n\n \n Power for who?\n \n \nweak dollar: a weak dollar will help stabilize the trade deficit in the long run. makes import more expensive and exports less so. mostly when the dollar is freely traded.\n\n \n A weak dollar will NOT help stabilise the trade deficit?CA deficit in the long run. This si the problem with people getting their information form sound bytes being made by well wishers. There is NO EVIDENCE that a weak dollar in the long term will help CA defcit. In fact, all evidence points to exactly the opposite. When carter was president and the dollar dropped, people were told the same thing. Guess what? Our deficit has gotten worse every year. The dollar has been dropping in the long, mid, and short term, and the trade deficit keeps getting worse. We still cannot compete with imports, nor will we be able to when the dollar is even weaker, because we import all of our production materials, so we cannot just lower our prices based on the weaker dollar.\n \n \ninflation: what inflation???\n\n \n The inflation that has always been preceded by rising energy costs in the US. This is why we don't factor energy costs or food (since food production in this country is so incredibly energy intensive that oil and food are the same thing) into inflationary figures. Currently, oil is running in excess of $50 per barrel, NOT because there is any shortage of it, but because the petro dollar is so low, and OPEC nations generally accept payment in dollars, but then have to pay operating costs in Euros. \n \n Just wait. This is more of that short term, uneducated, uninformed, economic mentality that has become so prevelant in this country. EVERY TIME IN HISTORY that a nations currency has lost significant value, the nation has suffered inflation. It is NEVER right away. What makes you, or anybody else for that matter, think the US will be any different? Inflation has always followed currency devaluation by 1-3 years, depending on how long the nations trading partners are willing to float them. \n \n the really scary thing is that if you factor in energy costs and food to our inflationary figures RIGHT NOW, you are looking at nearly 30% inflation (yearly). Nobody has suggested that the price of oil will be going down any time soon. There is no doubt that there WILL BE inflation. The energy costs are just the tip of the iceberg, as they have always been.",

   "texas. no, the point was that the oil bust + S&L crisis was a much bigger hit for texas than the supposed housing bubble will be a problem for the US economy. these are the relative scales.\n\n \n And my point was that there was a massive federal bailout in texas so net effect was minimal, if it even existed.\n \n \nthat is not a link. in financial terms a mobile home is not a house as you do not own the land on which it sits.\n\n \n Wrong answer. THe VAST majority of mobile homes are not sitting on rental property (i.e a mobile home park). Most people who own mobile homes DO own the land on which they sit, and most states (all with the exception of flordia) do not allow that \"mobile homes\" actually be \"mobile\" They must have their wheels removed and be sitting on some form of foundation (though the definition of \"foundation\" is flexible in most places). I own a half dozen mobile homes that are rented to college kids. They count exactly the same as my regular rental properties. The definition of \"home\" is basically a structure designed to be occupied on a domestic capacity. I am not aware of any reporting that cuts mobile homes from the final tally, or even any that address the issue, since to do so would be largely foolish. \n \n \nsmall manufacturing set ups are happening on a regular basis still. it is the intermediate/medium companies that are being hurt most by globalization.\n\n \n Any evdience to this, or just guessing? Since manufaturing is down in the US, and small manufacturing is down nearly 40% over the last 10 years, I seriosly doubt your statement.\n \n \ndefine \"actual wealth\"\n\n \n Tangible wealth\n \n \nmy thought process on the federal deficit is that it will be corrected because there is political will to do so. and as the spending is in actual dollars of an estimated tax income, as tax income increases the deficit will fall. it will take time but it will not hurt the economy as is. we have faced significant deficits before.\n\n \n Maybe you could point to the \"political will to do so\". Last year, the deficit was all the news. Our response? bigger deficit this year. Whoopee. The only way our deficit is going to decrease is by force, i.e people no longer willing to lend us money. If you look at the results of the last several treasury bond issues, you will see this is already happening. 20-30% of new issues being unsold has become the norm.\n \n \npower is there for whoever wishes to harnest it. currently it binds, which allows some limitation on how far tensions will go.\n\n \n Once you hit a certain breaking point, point, that power works in reverse, as we have seen lately with the asian situation. The Us has gone from playing the \"you will do what we say beacuse we owe you hundreds of billions of dollars and you want to see a return on that\" to taking a position where we let Japan and China dictate terms to us becuase we need them to help finance our debt, and we REALLY don't want to see them start dumping our bonds on the market.\n \n \na weak dollar in the short term will help the trade deficit, whether long term will depend on our level of import of raw materiels for manufacturing.\n\n \n All the benifit of a weak dollar has been spent. Our on hand stocks have already been depeleted. Now we are paying a higher value for our imported materials and machinery, and getting paid in weak dollars for our exports. As an added bonus, most of our importers, witht he exception of NAFTA partners, are requiring payments for imports be made in Euros. \n \n \ninflation is not currently a problem\n it will be a problem only when it outpaces income and available credit.\n as to energy cost even OPEC realizes high oil prices is bad for business.\n\n \n BUT, Opec has not been hurt by the high oil prices. They have movewd the baseline target price from the mid $30's to the mid $50's. Oil is still cheap, the dollar is just worth less. While this is certianly a problem in the US, it is certainly not a problem in the rest of the world. the rest of the worlds energy costs have remained static or risen by less than 3%. Lets say you live in germany, sure, oil is now $53 per barrel. That is 40.5 euros. A year ago, a gallon of oil, paid for in Euros, only cost 40 euros. While the petro dollar price of oil has gone up, the actual value has not, and those who are working in other currencies are apying the same for their oil that they have in the past.\n \n Inflation has already outpaced income, and available credit only matters if you plan to charge everything. While this certainly does seem to be the American way, nay rational person can tell you that this is a bad way of doing buisness. It used to be people said \"inflation is only a problem if it outpaces income\". The fact that we have added \"available credit\" should be a pretty good indicator of our future economic plans, namely to bury ourselves in debt and pretend there is no problem.\n \n \nscaremongering is amusing when it comes to the economy.\n\n \n As is blind, ignorant optimism. The question is, which are we seeing here. In order for your economic theory to be correct, you have to accept the following things:\n \n 1. That there are no disadvantages to operating in the red\n 2. That no matter how much you spend, there will always be more money\n 3. That raising interest rates, which ahs always been done in order to control the supply of expansion capitol, indirectly controlling inflation, in spite of the fact that there IS no demand for expansion capitol, is somehow a good sign\n 4. That the debtor holds some kind of mystical power over their creditor (call and tell your bank this, I am sure they could use a good laugh)\n 5. That increased government spending coupled with decreased revenue will lead to deficit reduction",

   "amusing\n \n 1. and there will be a massive bail out when the housing \"bubble\" bust, thus minimizing the impact. your point being?\n\n \n And where exactly do you think they are going to come up with money for a $2 or $3 trillion dollar bailout, especially in light of the fact that such a hit will put tax revenues through the floor? You do understand that the governemtn hs no money of its own, and that all its money comes from the taxpayers and our economic system, right? And that a 3 trillion hit to that system will have a terrible effect on government revenues?\n \n The idea of a government bailout of a 3 trillion housing crash would be laughable of it was not so silly. The governemtn could not pull a bailout of the .com bubble, which was, at worst, half the size of the housing bubble. \n \n \n2. LOL. do you even get realestate? there is a vast difference between the legal definition for house + land and home without land. the term mobile home as Eddie asked about certainly do not pertains to the prefab double wides sitting on owned land.\n\n \n Tehy certainly do, since prefab doublewides sitting on owned land in the coutry ALSO depreciate. I am a little confused abotu where you are getting your information. I could not find any studies when I looked this afternoon that differentiated between prefab/manufatured housing, sitting on own land or not, and regualr home sales. \n \n \n3. evidence of entrepreneurship? every day buddy every day. come out of the retirement homes every so often to see the world.\n\n \n No, I asked for evidence that these entrepeneurial startups were making it in the industrial secotor. Since even large manufaturers are closing their doors or scaling back, I think your ascertation is more of your foolish, childish reasoning. \n \n \n4. your usage of GDP as index of material wealth is funny (not ha ha). gdp/gnp talks of economic health, not material wealth.\n\n \n No, it doesn't. GDP is basically a count of monetary transaction. That is why service sector transactions are great GDP polishers (as are military expenditures), but have no bearing on the wealth of a nation. In a healthy, industrial economy, GDP is a great indicator of growth and (by association) wealth. Since we do not have a healthy industrial economy, GDP/GNP is a good indicator of nothing. \n \n \n5. deficit ... yeah, the doom and gloom that will consume us.\n US deficit \n hey, since you can tell the future (\"bigger deeficit this year\"), who is going to win the NCAA men's basketball?\n\n \n There is no fortune telling invloved. You figure expected revenues, the subtract expected expenditure, and you come uyp with a $412 billion deficit this year, as opposed to $410 last year. Those are the numbers from the Bush white house. The $412 billion does not include allowances for discretionary spending. \n \n What, you though that the deficit was jsut a big surprise at the end of the year? We got to the end and went \"HOLY COW, we didn't have enough money? And yet you seem to be arguing for Bushs phantom deficit reduction plan. Under your logic (foolish as it may be), he has no idea what the deficit might be in 10 years. \n \n \noh yeah, Bush lied! that's fresh. he lied about how bad the deficit is inorder to have a deficit that isn't as bad, when its congress that controlls the budget. yeah!\n\n \n Yep, thats pretty much it. He lied. He pulled a numebr out of his butt and promised to cut it in half because he knew that there was no chance he could cut the real number in half. His plan also assumes increased revenue due to economic growth (growth on par with that of china, which is not even possible for the US) and redyced federal spending. It does not include ANY supplemental spending, nor does it include programs whose price tag was unknown, like the prescitption drug plan ($1 trillion plus) or the medicare supplemental plan, which increased form an estimates $400 billion to $550 billion (but the white house didn't release that until AFTER the media had plenty of time to report the \"deficit halve\" promise).\n \n If you are corrct (which by now is starting to look like a fools assumption from the start) and congress has total budgetary control, why would the president be promising to halve the deficit? he would have no control. WAIT, thats right, he SIGNS the budget, and without his signature it is toilet paper.\n \n \n \n6. the consumer in europe have long been overcharged for oil, thus they have a cushier margin to absorb rising prices. \n higher oil prices will cool economies, meaning less oil consumption. its like krack, you don't give too much and have your clients OD.\n\n \n European markup for oil is similar, and in many cases much less, than that of the US., What makes european oil expensive is not the profit margins involved. It is the taxes. The taxes have not changed. Oil is simply NOT MORE EXPENSIVE if you don't generally do business in dollars. The price of oil in dollars has jumped form $35 to $53. The cost in euros has increased from $40 to $40.5. This is why the rest of the world is not up in arms about high oil prices. They are only high if you happen to live int eh US.\n \n Despite the increases, our consumption has not changed. We continue to use oil at the same increasing rate. Our debt rate has changed, and directly porportional to the increase. We ar just charging our fuel. \n \n \n7. our manufacturing stocks are already depleted? what economic sources are you relying on there bud? do you know what our major exports are?\n do you know how much materiel cost play into profit margins of exports ... as opposed to say labor?\n\n \n Our on hand stocks are depleted. Cant you read?\n \n I know all about how material costs and labor costs factor into exports. Labor is essentially a fixed cost. Materials are not. The only way to get around the high labor costs in the US is to leave the US. You still have the probelm of fluctuating materials costs. \n \n \n8. strawman. i never said it was good to be in the red. i said there are certain short term advantages to being in the red. these are well known. as are the long term consequences of staying too long in the red. thus the problem with the deficit is knowing when to come out and how to come out without hurting.\n\n \n Even in that you are wrong. Under certain conditions, there are possible advantages to operating in the red. We are not under those conditions, nor have we been since the 70's. There has not been any real benifit to being \"in the red\" since the 60s. \n \n \nbush is the the devil/hitler!\n fresh.\n\n \n No, he is just an idiot who is more interested in maintaining the status quo and making provisions for his corporate buddies than he is in ensureing long term economic health for the nation.",

   "Just a few points and questions\n \n @ Daewo\n \n Why shouldn`t services be considered tangiable? I mean, if I`m ready to trade 1 good (like a coca cola) for 1 service (like a haircut), wouldn`t that imply that the happiness/satisfaction I derive from the service woyuld be just as real and tangiable as the good I gave away? At the moment, services tends to be non-tradeable goods, which means that you can`t trade domesticly produced services for foreign goods. This would lend some support to your idea that services are not as important as industrial output. However, more and more services are being traded across borders. In time, I think that only very few services will still be non-tradeable.\n \n I would also like to point out that we may have a housing bubble in europe as well. The way the interest rates have looked (coupled with expectations on never ending price appreciation on the real estate markets) have made the price on real estate sky-rocket i certain european countries. The ECB has even started to consider using a special weight on real estate when setting the interest rate. Brittain has allready taken such actions.\n \n @ fracas\n \n inflation can certainly become a problem before it outpaces income. When it do however, you have a humungus problem on your hands (as it will most certainly trigger a massive wage-inflation cycle possibly resulting in hyper-inflation). That being said, I don`t see the indicators that the US inflation will rise anytime soon either. In europe, we are more afraid of a japanese-type situation where we get caugt in an interest rate trap, unable to stimulate demand through lowering the interest rates. Perhaps this is more of a threat than inflation hypes to the US as well, as I don`t really see how our economic situation differs in this regard.",

   "I read all these posts on all internal transaction based GDP being a good thing and wonder if I attended the wrong schools. \n \n 1. Internal transaction portions of GDP are generally accepted as being 60-70% of a developed nation's GDP. Why? There's no value added in those transactions, which means they eventually disappear by flow-through internal consumption without adding national wealth to sustain a tax base for expansion, i.e. raising the standard of living. $1 spent on a tax preparer is gone forever. It dissolves into the system without ever increasing in value. Flow-through sustains it for a short period, unless it goes into bombs or such, with no flow through benefit. \n \n 2. Export transactions take that same dollar, transport it out of the country, and bring back say $1.25, or $.25 of new wealth. \n \n 3. Import transactions ship the dollar out of the country, no new wealth, loss of existing wealth, no flow-through from internal transactions.\n \n 4. If 65% of a county's GDP is internal transactions, 16% import transactions and 17% export transactions, a slim margin of new wealth is entering that country for whatever purpose; debt service, infrastructure, military, etc.\n \n Most of Old Western Europe suffers from the same problem the US is experiencing, a maturing service economy (unemployment for Europe) with increased tax requirements and poor balance of trade (imports vrs exports for the US) contributing to increased internal transactions without adequate new wealth entering the country. Old Europe has a big advantage over the US in that they haven't incurred abnormal personal and public debt service, have military expenditures that reflect a defensive posture and as a whole retain an acceptable portion of national wealth in personal savings. Most of Europe stays (or did the last time I looked) at around 60-75% of GDP for internal transactions. As a contrast, the US is running close to 85% due to our military spending and rampantly expanding public debt. \n \n Newer Europe, less mature economies, has little debt (not by choice), lower standards of living equaling lower tax burdens, in many cases minimal defense expenditures, work forces with motivation driven by those lower standards of living, personal savings in even the poorest nations and overall economic circumstances ripe for industrial expansion. Blending old and new European economies, while initially painful to mature, aged work force nations, will grow both in a profitable manner.\n \n Europe, assuming EU comes together soon enough to properly service Chinese, Asian and internal markets, has a light at the end of the economic tunnel. The US has no such potential cushion.",

Part of this is due to the fact that US industry ios not viewed with awe anymore, and if you are going to hire somebody to come and tell you how to do things, you don't want to start with somebody who has run thier own business into the ground. \n \n \nI would also like to point out that we may have a housing bubble in europe as well. The way the interest rates have looked (coupled with expectations on never ending price appreciation on the real estate markets) have made the price on real estate sky-rocket i certain european countries. The ECB has even started to consider using a special weight on real estate when setting the interest rate. Brittain has allready taken such actions.\n\n \n I don't know about the rest of europe, but the british CERTAINLY are living inside a huge, govertnment subsidized, fragile housing bubble.",

   "I read all these posts on all internal transaction based GDP being a good thing and wonder if I attended the wrong schools. \n \n 1. Internal transaction portions of GDP are generally accepted as being 60-70% of a developed nation's GDP. Why? There's no value added in those transactions, which means they eventually disappear by flow-through internal consumption without adding national wealth to sustain a tax base for expansion, i.e. raising the standard of living. $1 spent on a tax preparer is gone forever. It dissolves into the system without ever increasing in value. Flow-through sustains it for a short period, unless it goes into bombs or such, with no flow through benefit. \n \n 2. Export transactions take that same dollar, transport it out of the country, and bring back say $1.25, or $.25 of new wealth. \n \n 3. Import transactions ship the dollar out of the country, no new wealth, loss of existing wealth, no flow-through from internal transactions.\n \n 4. If 65% of a county's GDP is internal transactions, 16% import transactions and 17% export transactions, a slim margin of new wealth is entering that country for whatever purpose; debt service, infrastructure, military, etc.\n \n Most of Old Western Europe suffers from the same problem the US is experiencing, a maturing service economy (unemployment for Europe) with increased tax requirements and poor balance of trade (imports vrs exports for the US) contributing to increased internal transactions without adequate new wealth entering the country. Old Europe has a big advantage over the US in that they haven't incurred abnormal personal and public debt service, have military expenditures that reflect a defensive posture and as a whole retain an acceptable portion of national wealth in personal savings. Most of Europe stays (or did the last time I looked) at around 60-75% of GDP for internal transactions. As a contrast, the US is running close to 85% due to our military spending and rampantly expanding public debt. \n \n Newer Europe, less mature economies, has little debt (not by choice), lower standards of living equaling lower tax burdens, in many cases minimal defense expenditures, work forces with motivation driven by those lower standards of living, personal savings in even the poorest nations and overall economic circumstances ripe for industrial expansion. Blending old and new European economies, while initially painful to mature, aged work force nations, will grow both in a profitable manner.\n \n Europe, assuming EU comes together soon enough to properly service Chinese, Asian and internal markets, has a light at the end of the economic tunnel. The US has no such potential cushion.\n\n \n Well said, George",

   "Happiness/satisfaction has no place in economics. Your money does not care if you are happy or satisfied or not. You now have a coke, and have created a non value added transaction. The GDP will show the price of one coke, but there is no inherent value to your short hair, unless you sell the ahir, then it could be argued that your head is an industrial enterprise. \n\n \n As far as I know, utility is a rather central aspect of economic \"science\". And what is utility if not some form of measurment for individual (and/or societal) happyness/satisfaction? \n \n If I put it like this, if I`m indifferent between a coca cola and a haircut, why should me, purchasing the coca cola be assigned more economic importance than me purchasing a haircut asuming everything else equal? I get the same utility and I can`t re-sell the coca cola after I have drunk it, just like I can`t re-sell the haircut. \n \n Now, one could make the argument that other non-consumer goods have a re-sale value, but this value would be taken into the consumers consideration wether to buy the good or the service so it doesn`t carry any weight either.\n \n \nThis has long been the belief of folks who support the current \"service based\" economy in the US.

The nature of proprietary entertainment products is such that industry has long distributed product rights under licensing agreements, not actual products, through a snakes nest of subsidiaries for favorable tax treatment. In example, a film is licensed to a European distributor for X dollars. That licensee then licenses the film to individual countries for X dollars/euros, who in turn distribute to theaters for X amount. The DVD takes an entirely different path. How much of foreign distribution profit remains with the film producer is obvious, but US ownership of foreign entity profit will be declared as separate revenue, often as dividends and country estates and then there's of course interested parties where US tax will never see a dime.",

   "That tells me mature European economies are facing many of the same labor overhead and compliance problems as US industry with identical changes being implemented for purposes of survival. While opening cross-border immigration and/or commerce headquartering will eventually somewhat lower standards of living in the mature nations for the general working populace, is the trade for increase in standard of living in less mature countries not desirable for overall economic gain in both countries? \n \n I obviously speak from an objective point of view, mature country line workers would consider even a fractional reduction in standard of living a personal threat, but that's a political, not economic consideration. I'd think the youth of both sectors, mature and not mature, would be screaming for change as those in mature nations have no future as jobs disappear to lower cost labor increasing already severe tax burdens they'll inherit and less mature nations would raise standards of living in commingling expanded industry in all EU nations. Such a change would be of benefit for all, including individual governments, excepting those entrenched line workers obviously being compensated far beyond market value in a global economy. \n \n I can already hear Eddie sputtering due to his nation's abnormally dominant labor force.",

   "I`m actually not that worried. The anchor for our economy is still our lumber and ore industries. And they are not that easy to outsource. And even the parts of the industries that can be outsourced have comperative advantages in Sweden due to the proximity to the natural resource.\n \n That being said, I`m sure we`ll be experiencing some painful changes in our economy. Certain industries will become uncompetative and will disappear. This will surely hurt a bit and will increase unemployment. But it is hardly the say of reckoning we are talking about. \n \n As for our strong labour movements. I would actually say that their dominance is benefitial in this situation. Just like the labour unions allowed our textile-industries and shipping industries wither and die out when they became uncompetative, the labour unions will allow the culling to take place this time around as well. In fact, as large labour unions will look out for the interest of all their members. And as our largest labour union alone organise around 50% of our total workforce, their interest is quite in line with the \"national interest\". Compare this with small, but politicly vocal labour unions in, for example, France who`s interests only represent a tiny fraction of the population.",

But here's the clincher. Dialynas considers it key that the \"U.S. standard of living must decline substantially.\" Yeah, read that again and let it sink in. Your standard of living and mine must \"decline substantially.\" It is clear Dialynas intends the vast majority of Americans to become much, much poorer for his global economic recovery schemes to work.\n \n But if it is clear to any reader, it is not clear apparently to the PIMCO Press Center. I asked them \"am I misunderstanding, or is Dialynas saying Americans in general (if not in particular) must become substantially poorer if both the U.S. and the world are to avoid serious economic consequences?\" I received a response from Mark Porterfield, presumably of the PIMCO Press Center. He wrote, and I quote:\n \n \"They (sic) way I interpreted it was Americans must learn to live with less debt.\"\n \n Wordy, I agree. But worse than the typo and the brevity, of course, is the spin. Though Dialynas was clearly referring to Americans being poorer, Porterfield wants us to believe he actually simply meant we need to cut back on our debt\n",

When was the first question and how much of a cushion the government provided and for how long was the only major issue. When China began implementing their major industrial infrastructure improvements in the early '90s, the trend to a true global economy was becoming reality. After the dot.com bubble burst looked promising as a first step to fiscal reality for the US, but 9/11 changed everything and provided the standing administration with all the tools necessary to use public indebtedness and war to perpetuate economic numbers that, while sating the public, greatly reduced possibility of a gradual, somewhat controlled decline.\n \n Western Europe experienced the same sort of decline, but without the false US trend created by 9/11. Unemployment there has increased on IMO a normal pace for a maturing economy facing growing global competition. The EU offers a solution of overall economic expansion, at a political and standard of living cost for mature nations yet to be determined, for their dilemna. I still don't see any similar opportunity as an option for the US.",
