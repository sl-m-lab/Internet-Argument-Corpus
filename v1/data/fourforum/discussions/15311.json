   "Well isn't that amazing Galileo. Just a few days ago we were talking about how you seem to have dropped off the map, and today you show up with not one but two articles of complete BS for the purpose of debunking. I was starting to think that you abandoned ship because you finally grew tired of being rebuked and your sources eviscerated. I guess I was wrong.\n \n Oh well onto the meat of this fiasco.\n \n \n\"This article summarizes the scientific literature on the health risks and benefits of having a gun in the home for the gun owner and his/her family. For most contemporary Americans, scientific studies indicate that the health risk of a gun in the home is greater than the benefit. The evidence is overwhelming for the fact that a gun in the home is a risk factor for completed suicide and that gun accidents are most likely to occur in homes with guns.\n\n \n To kick things off let's remember something very basic; a gun is a deadly weapon, there's absolutely no way to change that fact. So naturally anytime you're dealing with something deadly, be it a gun or a bottle of asprin, or a bottle of cleaning chemicals, there's going to be some elevated risk of harm to someone who might be in the home. However an elevated level of risk doesn't mean that it's a serious danger that must be negated and addressed.\n \n Exactly what methodology was used by these \"scientific studies\" to reach the conclusion that gun ownership presents a greater health risk than a benefit? I'd like to review what guidelines were being followed to make this ultimate determination. Where exactly is the peer review of this piece?\n \n Nevermind the fact that somebody intent on committing suicide will do it with whatever is available, I'm going for the last part of the sentence, \"and that gun accidents are most likely to occur in homes with guns.\" What exactly is this other than simply stating a fact? Gun accidents are more likely to occur in homes with guns? More likely than what in comparison? It's kind of hard to have an object-related accident unless said object is actually present at the time. You can't really have a choking incident happen if there's not something to choke on can you? A child can't electrocute themselves by sticking a fork in a power outlet if you have no forks in the house can you?\n \n Gun accidents are more likely to occur in homes with guns? More likely than what in comparison, amusement parks? More likely to occur than in homes without guns? Exactly what point are you trying to make? Are you trying to claim that since something exists it might somehow pose a risk if it's used incorrectly? Congratulations you've just proved that there are XXXXXX in the world who will find a way to hurt themselves because they're XXXXXX.\n \n \nThere is compelling evidence that a gun in the home is a risk factor for intimidation and for killing women in their homes.\n \n \n Come again? Exactly what does intimidation have to do with anything here? How does that even factor into your twisted equation? And what is this \"compelling evidence\" that you speak of to make this determination and others? What is the evidence and how was it obtained? Were the \"researched\" following the Kellerman method of obtaining data and simply looked at how many people were killed?\n \n You claim that a gun in the home is a risk factor for killing women in their homes. Are you making the claim that a woman who buys a gun for self defense will wind up having it taken away from her and used against her? Is that your claim or are you saying something else? If that isn't your claim then what exactly are you saying with this statement of yours?\n \n There have been numerous claims regarding women and gun ownership for self defense purposes, far too many of them to list examples at this late hour. Yet all of them seem to paint a negative picture that women are somehow unable to adequately protect themselves even once armed, because supposedly somehow their male assailants will be able to neutralize their armed status and kill them as if it were a cake walk.\n \n How is this determination ultimately reached? Why is it when the talk of gun ownership comes up women are always the victims of abusive armed spouses? Do you simply believe it's impossible for the woman to be armed and able to kill her abuser? It's really not something of fantasy but rather reality. Women are able to be armed and protect themselves and triumph over those that would beat them for absolutely no reason. If you can't grasp that fact then you really have no business telling others what they should be believing. You might as well tell them that unicorns are real.\n \n \nOn the benefit side, there are fewer studies, and there is no credible evidence of a deterrent effect of firearms or that a gun in the home reduces the likelihood or severity of injury during an altercation or break-in.\n\n \n Estimating intruder-related firearm retrievals in ... [Violence Vict. 1997] - PubMed result\n \n \nTo estimate the frequency of firearm retrieval because of a known or presumed intruder, the authors analyzed data from a 1994 national random digit dialing telephone survey (n = 5,238 interviews). Three mutually exclusive definitions of firearm retrieval were constructed: (1) retrieved a firearm because there might be an intruder, (2) retrieved a firearm and saw an intruder, and (3) retrieved a firearm, saw an intruder, and believed the intruder was frightened away by the gun. Of 1,678 (34%) households with firearms, 105 (6%) retrieved a firearm in the previous 12 months because of an intruder. National projections based on these self-reports reveal an estimated 1,896,842 (95% CI [confidence interval] = 1,480,647-2,313,035) incidents in which a firearm was retrieved, but no intruder was seen; 503,481 (95% CI = 305,093-701,870) incidents occurred in which an intruder was seen, and 497,646 (95% CI = 266,060-729,231) incidents occurred in which the intruder was seen and reportedly scared away by the firearm. Estimates of the protective use of firearms are sensitive to the definitions used. Researchers should carefully consider both how these events are defined and the study methods used.\n\n \n I truly find it impossible to believe that there's no credible evidence to suggest that gun ownership has a deterrent on crime. Would you care to explain how this is possible? Everyone who isn't currently mentally handicapped understands that guns are lethal and capable of inflicting devastating injury and/or outright death to anyone who is shot. Any criminal who has ever chosen to arm themselves with a gun knows that fact. Any criminal that has ever been shot at knows that fact. Do you really expect us to believe that they don't view this as a potential health threat to their line of work?\n \n You claim there's no credible evidence here. Is a gun's lethal nature somehow considered as not credible in nature?\n \n \nThus, groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics urge parents not to have guns in the home.\"\n Risks and Benefits of a Gun in the Home\n\n \n Galileo I remember a while back having a similar conversation with you when the subject of discussion was Michael Moore. Michael Moore's advice to people was to not buy a gun, basically he was telling people to not exercise their constitutional rights, ever. I tore apart this premise then and you should have learned from that then.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/14982-too-many-blacks-victimized-guns.html#post423668\n \n \nThis logic is no longer valid or acceptable. The Supreme Court ruling in the Heller case has put this argument to death. You can't tell someone \"If you want to reduce crime then don't exercise your constitutional rights.\" That simply doesn't work. Would you tell parents that if they want to reduce child pornography then they shouldn't have children or own a camera?\n\n \n \nMichael Moore's message of \"don't own a gun\" is literally him telling other people \"don't exercise your constitutional rights.\" Michael Moore is using his First Amendment rights to lecture other people on how they shouldn't use their rights because he doesn't agree with them. For a proper comparison that would be like us telling Michael Moore to never make another movie for as long as he lived because we don't support his lies and BS.\n \n You can't simply tell people to not exercise their rights. That would be like telling someone \"don't read any books\", \"don't take part in religion\", \"don't protest the government\", \"don't require the police to obtain a search warrant\", \"don't seek out legal council for any reason\", \"don't express yourself in a manner that could be offensive to others\" or any manner of other methods in which we exercise our constitutionally recognized and protected rights.\n \n Michael Moore's message isn't accepted. Nor will we tolerate such nonsense being passed around as so-called \"expert advice.\"\n\n \n Kindly stop trying to play this argument Galileo. It's been said before and I'll say it again because it bears repeating. You can't advise people to not exercise their constitutional rights. It's not an accepted answer nor will it be tolerated.\n \n \nSo why keep a gun at home for self protection?\n\n \n Where to start. Because it's a constitutional right? Because the police can't be everywhere? Because it works? Because it's the best solution available?\n \n Here's a better one for you Galileo. Come up with an alternative to gun ownership that is overwhelmingly effective at protecting life and discouraging criminal action. Give us examples of things you believe to work better in a way that would render gun ownership obsolete.",
