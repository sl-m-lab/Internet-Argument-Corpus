   "There is actually a good reason for this, believe it or not. Traditionally boxing first came about in street fights. Groups of men would gather about in a circle and two men would \"have at each other\". This group of course to get the best view would form a ring. Hence boxing ring. Once boxing became a sport in which there were rules, refs and the like and the boxers needed to seperate, they then added the corners, so that each boxer could go to their own corner, and not be molested by supporters from the other boxer. Additonally the corners were added for refs to run into to remain out of the fight, and to retain the trapping factor which was so common when a boxer would beat his opponent into his best friend who would hold him so that his buddy could get some of the best hits in. Hence the corners, and the sqaure design of the boxing ring. ;)",
