   "7th Arty, why are you assuming that people oppose teaching evolution in schools solely for religious reasons?\n\n Of those who oppose it, not one in a thousand do so for reasons other than religion. That's a guess, but I have never met one. The only ones I know of were the astronomer Fred Hoyle and his cronies, and they proposed life planted on earth and guided by aliens.\n \nand why are you throwing these other religious issues into the thread?\n\n Because the question of the teaching of evolution or not is essentially a religious issue. Those opposed either want to teach their mythology, including the flood myth to explain geology, or advocate intelligent design by some designer that they are unwilling to name and for which they have no evidence.\n \nnobody is demanding that creation and the flood be taught in schools.\n\n Yes they are and have been for over 40 years. I've been around for the debates and the court cases. Where were you?\n \nI dont know where you got that from.\n\n I got that from Henry Morris of the ICR and Ken Ham of AIG and Wal Brown, Kent Hovind, Carl Baugh, and Don Patton. I got it from internet posters like Karl Crawford who posts under a variety of names. Do you want me to name more names? The one thing they all have in common is that they object to the teaching of evolution on religious grounds.\n \nbesides, there are many people that dont subscribe to religion and dont belive in God, and yet they do not accept the big bang theory.\n\n No there aren't.\n \nalso there are people that live a totally religious lifestyle and yet embrace evolution and the big bang theory.\n\n What does \"totally religious lifestyle\" mean? If you mean that there are some people of faith who understand and accept science and have no conflict with their faith, yes there are. But I am not talking about them. I did not deny their existance. I am talking about those who oppose the teaching if evolution and other scientific theories in public schools. That opposition is almost without exception for religious reasons. As I pointed out, no one has reached the conclusions of creationism by an examination of the evidence - not once, ever.\n \nso please becareful with how you toss your brackets and deal with the issue of the discussion\n\n Perhaps you don't understand what the issues are.\n \nit is not true that all science is being ammended daily.\n\n If what you say is true then what is being taught is not science. Science is a process of learning and questioning. Possibly not the current changes are being constantly discussed in public schools, but that isn't the point anyway. The best that can be hoped for in public schools is to impart an understanding of what science is, how it works, and a few of the basic underlying concepts. All science is being amended daily because that is what science does.\n \nthere is no science taught in schools that is even close to the disparity of the big bang theory among scientists.\n\n Actually, there isn't any big \"disparity of the big bang theory\" among scientists. You are mistaken. Actually, I think that accepatance of the big bang theory is almost universal among cosmologists. What you see as disagreement are just several different explainations for how the details might have occurred.\n \njust last month a new theory about the origin of the Big Bang was featured in the discover magazine that removes singularity, plank time and dark matter out of the equation, and includes parallel universes in planes on different dimensions.\n\n You didn't read closely enough. I think that you are refering to a paper on brane theory that was published. Brane theory does not propose parallel universes but actually says that they don't exist. Brane theory is an extension to 5 dimensions and the particular theory that you are talking about proposes that our universe is a colision between two branes that exist in 5th dimensional space. The result is a universe in 4 dimensions. What you also failed to notice is that the scientists who published the paper in question specifically stated that their intent was not to reject the big bang theory but to offer lines of research and discussion.\n \nit is still being very hotly debated and the scientific arena is not just split on the issue, its fragmented\n\n No. What you think of as hot debate is just discussions of those lines of research and discussion.\n \nthe science that is being taught in schools are mostly based on observed and testable phenomena, that have withstood the test of time, trial and error.\n\n It only looks that way to those who aren't familiar with what is going on. We must teach only the basics and the underlying principles because of the restrictions of time and the understanding of the students. For example, the understand physics you need calculus. For biology you need a good understanding of statistics. Only the initial elements of those are covered in public schools. The limits on that knowledge is also a limit on the depth to which science can be studied. Real depth comes in upper division college courses, after the basic courses in science and math.\n \n Let me illustrate what I mean. The university from which I graduated requires the following for a Bachelor of Science in Biology - 42 semester hours of biology, including besides general biology, cell biology, ecology, genetics, evolution, molecular biology and biochemistry. 16 hours in chemistry - first general chemistry and then organic chemistry. This prepares one for the biochem. 8 hours of math - either calculus or statistics. This prepares one for genetics, evolution, molecular biology and the chemistry and physics. 8 hours of physics.\n \n In addition, 46 hours in other subjects like English, humanities and physical education are required - the \"core curriculum\" or general requirements and electives. High school should prepare students to enter these courses at the freshman level. Sadly we don't. How many high school graduates are actually ready for calculus? How many take remedial math or remedial Englisn as freshmen?\n \nthe big bang theory is still in its infant stages\n\n Far from it. Perhaps if you took the time to educate yourself. Why don't you read Wrinkles in Time by George Smoot. The book is about 10 years old but it will educate you as to why the theory isn't in it's infancy. Or read The Whole Shebang: A State of the Universe Report by Timothy Ferris - a really good book. You should be able to get either at your library. I can suggest others.",

I accept them as the best explainations for the observed data - especially in those areas where I have some education and experience. I believe things for which I have no evidence or almost no evidence.\n \nbut school kids are not in a position to understand the evidence for this.\n\n Yes they are.\n \nSo we teach it without actually discussing the supporting evidence.\n\n Absolutely wrong. We teach the evidence and why it points to evolution. It is useless to teach nothing but the conclusions without showing how those conclusions are reached. You are describing the way \"creation science\" is taught. They start from the conclusion. By the way, biologists don't generally make a distinction between macro and microevolution.\n \nThis is a pretty useless state of affairs and so if evolution is causing parents angst I don't mind getting rid of it.\n\n I do. It would be like not teaching geology because it causes parents who know nothing about geology to get upset. Geology gets reduced to a litany of the names of rocks without any of the theory on how they are formed.\n \nI certainly don't advocate teaching \"creation science\" in public schools and if you actually discuss where all the species came in science class you should only mention evolution.\n\n The funny thing is that I can give you several examples of the evolution of new species that are in progress right now. I've typed them all before but I'll type them all again if you want to learn. Examples of members of the same population that cannot interbreed. Members of different populations that don't even look alike that can interbreed. Ask Ursus maritimus about that. I'm sure he can give you a good example.",

A very good way to show the classical heirarchical classification of life.\n \n There are many evolutionary lineages that have been well documented in the fossil record - whales, humans, reptiles to mammals, fish to amphibians, and so forth. Showing pictures of these fossils (and artists reconstructions, if possible - although care should be taken to point out that scientists themselves don't work with reconstructions). What's so hard to understand about this?\n \n Also, high school biology already talks about molecular genetics.

   "Im curious, you say you personally doubt that the big bang theory is valid, yet you accept that it is valid among scientists in general? how so?\n\n At the risk of being off-topic:\n \n The idea of a sudden beginning of time, or at least a point beyond which there is no \"past\", violates my sense of symmetry. As far as we know, the universe is, overall, flat, which, if I understand cosmology correctly, means that it extends forever in all spatial directions. It is \"offensive\" to me to think that time, also, wouldn't extend forever in both directions.\n \n Note that this is not science, but a philosophical objection. I know full well that we can run the \"movie\" backwards to about ten-to-the-ungodly-small-number after the \"Big Bang\", and that the universe at this point must have been very hot and dense. However, I am not yet convinced, for personal philosphical reasons, that we can extrapolate past this, get a singularity, and insist that this is when everything began. Even some of the current ideas that remove the singularity and compare the \"beginning of time\" with the North Pole isn't very satisfying since I want time to go backwards forever.\n \n Sadly, I acknowledge that the universe has no obligation to behave the way I want. Everything about Big Bang, and all the hypotheses that pertain to it, I realize are all good science, and there are (as yet) no theories that would meet my objections. I, myself, would never insist that my idiosyncactic notions should be passed off as science in the public schools! Silly rabbit, science class is for science, and I bow to the judgement of the scientists that actually work in these fields.\n \n Still, I always have hope that Fred Hoyle is going to eventually pull it off.... ;)",

   "First you need to understand that macroevolution is evolution at or above the species level. If you recognize that organisms do, in fact, speciate, then you accept macroevolution. And once two populations have become separate species, they continue to evolve and change and grow farther and farther apart.\n \n Examples of incipient speciation:\n \n The herring gull ranges throughout northern Europe, Great Britain, and out to Iceland. It meets American herring gulls over the northern Atlantic. There is little difference between them and they interbreed wherever they meet. The American herring gull ranges across North America to Alaska. At the Bering Strait it meets and interbreeds with the Vega herring gull. This bird is quite similar in appearance, a bit darker body feathers make it distinguishable from the other herring gulls. The Vega herring gull population is adjacent to and interbreeds with Birula's gull. Birula's gull is adjacent to and interbreeds with Heuglin's gull. Heuglin's gull is adjacent to and interbreeds with the Siberian lesser black-backed gull. Finally, the Siberian lesser black-backed gull is adjacent to and interbreeds with the lesser black-backed gull. So the lesser black-backed gull and the herring gull are extremes of the same continuous and contiguous population. Except that herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls don't interbreed. They are separate species and have been assigned different species names.\n \n The lungless salamander Ensatina eschscholtzi is ranges from Baja California to British Colombia. 7 distinct subspecies are recognized. Beginning from Baja and going north they are eschscholtzi, xanthoptica, picta, orogonensis, and back south around the California central valey, croceater, klauberi. The eschscholtzi and the klauberi meet at several locations in southern California. At the northern most point they interbreed while at the southern most point they do not.\n \n The greenish warbler, Phylloscopus trochiloides is a continuous population of song bird that encircles the Tibeten Plateau. On the northern side of the plateau in central Siberia the birds form two non-interbreeding populations. Again, like in the herring gulls, it is the two extremes of an expanding population that have become unable (or unwilling) to interbreed.\n \n And, of course, Brown bears are found all over the norther hemisphere. Genetically they are indistinguishable and in all cases where bears from remote locations have been brought together, they interbreed. There is one exception. The Brown bears from the ABC Islands of Alaska are genetically a bit different from the rest of the Brown bears even though they are able to interbreed. However, the ABC bears are genetically indistinguishable from Polar bears. It is interesting that Polar bears are perfectly interfertile with Brown bears and produce fertile offspring. Funny since Polar bears have so many physiological characteristics by which they differ from Brown bears (head, face, ears, neck, legs, paws, body, fur). Yet another incipient species, for Polar bears and Brown bears never meet in the wild.\n \n Those are examples of macroevolution beyond any doubt. We can see it happening.\n \n How about this. Apples (and pears and cherries) are not native to North America. In the early 1800s apples were introduced into the Ohio Valley. There were no natural pests in this environment. However, in the 1850s the apples were discovered to have become infested with worms. Investigation showed that they were the larvae of a fly very similar to the hawthorne maggot fly. Now these flies lay breed and lay their eggs just as the fruit sets, and the hawthorne and apple do not set fruit at the same time. Further, even if given the opportunity to interbreed, hawthorne maggot flies always breed with hawthorne maggot flies and always lay their eggs on the hawthrone fruit. The same is true of the apple maggot flies. It's pretty clear where the apple maggot flies came from. It is an example of speciation (macroevolution) in order to take advantage of a new food source. The same has occurred with pears and cherries with some variation of the same pest. There are now 4 species of maggot flies that do not interbreed.\n \n Oh, yeah. See the \"Evidence of Evolution\" thread. That is conclusive evidence. There are no predictions of \"common designer\" that would anticipate the information there and there are no scenarios that make is rational in a \"creation science.\"",

That isn't the case. Humans came from archaic Homo sapiens.\n \n However, the evidence indicates that the earth is older than 6,000 years and that there was no global flood 4500 years ago. The obligation of a government system of education is to teach science, as up to date and in as much detail as is possible to the age and ability of the students. The evidence indicates that all life descended from a single population of living organisms. The evidence indicates that the universe is about 13.7 billion years old. The evidence indicates that the earth is 4.6 billion years old, more or less. The evidence indicates that life on earth is about 3.8 billion years old.\n \n Why should Bible belt students be hanicaped when they reach college.

Where are these threads that allude to \"pure\" evolution? What is \"pure\" evolution? I've never heard of that. It seems that you have a couple of problems.

Genetics explains the mechanism of heredity. Genetics explains why dogs give birth to dogs and not cats. Genetics was at first considered to be evidence against evolution.

   "Here's one case that is closely related, only it deals with a Minnesota 9th grade biology teacher in 1998\n http://www.edweek.org/ew/newstory.cfm?slug=18scotus.h21&keywords=academic%20freedom\n \n And some more quotes that generally back up what I am saying: present more evidence and let people draw their own conclusions.\n \n(A public discussion on May 14, 1980 sponsored by the Community Services Office, San Diego Community College, and the Biology Department of San Diego Mesa College.)\n Neil Seagraves\n Those of us involved in the Creationist Movement are not at tempting to legislate biblical creation into science classrooms. Biblical creation is a belief that we hold, but we are no more ad vocating our belief in the Scriptures as a science subject than is the humanist advocating atheism as a subject for classroom discussion in science. The Creation Science Research Center is not attempting to introduce to public schools Bible stories or Bible verses. Neither are the other established responsible Creationist organizations. What we are advocating, rather, is the introduction into the science classroom of scientific data which are currently being ex cluded . . . namely, scientific data which conflict with the evolu tionary theories of origin, and which are needed for the critical evaluation of evolutionary theories as science. In conjunction with this, we are advocating the introduction into science textbooks of the scientific data which support the alternative explanation of origins, namely, intelligent, purposeful design and special crea tion. We are calling for reform in the teaching of science. Theories in science must not be protected. They must be continually open to critical evaluation. They must be thrown into open competition with alternate explanations. This is how science advances to bet ter understanding of the natural world. If evolutionary theories are to be studied in science classrooms, the current protectionist policy must cease . . . in the name of good science, good education, simple intellectual integrity.\n \n The premise on which we base our need for alternative theories is protection of religious beliefs. We use a legal premise under the first and fourteenth amendments of the U.S. Constitution and the Civil Rights Act in protection of creed. It is our understanding that philosophical belief systems constitute a religious or a creed position. Creed, as defined in the dictionary, can represent political as well as religious points of view. The Supreme Court, in the deci sions on Bible reading and prayer, ruled out any recognition of any particular religious point of view and pointed out that secular humanism is equally religious as an orthodox religious belief. At torney General Stanley Moss said that the neutrality requirements of the State and Federal Constitutions require the State of Califor nia to balance philosophical belief systems, and that atheist, agnostic and irreligious beliefs would be equally unconstitutional. The penalties for prescribing or advocating an atheist, agnostic or irreligious belief system would be the loss of the license of the teacher or the loss of State aid to the school, in exactly the same way that you would discipline a teacher for advocating Christianity or a particular religious point of view hat the schools are for bidden from doing is indoctrinating a particular philosophical system or belief. What they can do is teach about all points of view, giving recognition and respect for alternative points of view.\n \n The fact that the Creationists have gone a second mile and presented alternative scientific theories and explanations for origins is simply the frosting on the cake. We don't owe the educa tional system good science. We only require them to recognize alternative belief systems. It has been charged that we are trying to legislate into science classrooms theories that would not be sup ported in science. It is our contention that this is what has already been done by the humanist and the evolutionist ... that they have legislated into the science classrooms a particular point of view, mandating that every student adhere to it and making their grades dependent upon it. In years past, teachers could not even be hired if they did not adhere to this doctrinaire position. When we first began our studies, those scientists that are now part of the Crea tion Research Society were fearful of identifying themselves as not \n adhering to the evolutionary system for fear they would be fired. They could not achieve their Doctorate if they did not adhere to that point of view. We contend that is not science. That is scientism, and a religion. When we have asked the Board of Education to open up the science curriculum and subject evolution to falsification, we have been denied the privilege of criticizing it, or bringing into the classroom evidence that would tend to militate against it or falsify it. We contend that is not science instruction ... That is religious indoctrination into a particular belief system taught at tax expense. It violates the neutrality re quirements of our State Constitution, puts the State in the position of having adopted a particular religion of secular humanism, the State prescribing it and forcing every student to adhere to it. And that is why the Creationist Movement is so active today.\n \n \n \n \n Oh, here's the article that talks about the Washington science teacher.\n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=17819\n \n \n On some more of the arguments.\n 1. I never said that scientific theory is fact. I was trying to get across the fact that some teachers teach it as fact without making sure that it is a theory and that new discoveries are being made every day that could prove or disprove it (depending on your point of view).\n 2. Scientific texts are written by people. People are biased. Every word that is used to the evidence given is therefore biased. Look at everyone's arguments on the website. If you know that there is information disproving your point, will you post it? Or will you not mention it and hope that they do not find it? That is biased, though facts are used.\n 3. Again, I am not trying to say that abiogenesis is part of evolution. I am saying that some teachers teach it that way to the students.\n 4. Have I given any arguments for creationism/intelligent design theory to be taught? No. I am merely saying that all of the scientific facts should be given. The teacher might say, \"Here is some evidence __________ that seems to imply a younger Earth than the 6 billion [please don't correct me, it's really just an example] year old Earth that this other theory says is true. How could you explain that?\"\n 5. Again, this is really not a creation/evolution debate, though some people are trying to turn it into one. It is more of an educational curriculum debate. Treat it as such. If you want to debate evolution or creation, go to another thread. Here we will focus on if evolution or alternatives to evolution should be taught in public schools.",

   "I personally would not mind if evolution was not taught in schools. Just teach them about DNA and reproduction. If they care about the where do they come from they can teach themselves. To be honest if creationist parents were raised by creationist parents and the only parenting technique they have seen and understand involves repeatly stating \"everying in the bible is true\" I think we should let them have there way. If someone is incapable of analysing information by themselves they are better of just blindly believing their parents.\n\n \n Hi! I'm new here! I do not think that evolution should be taught as if it is the absolute truth. It is okay (I guess) to teach it as one interpretation of the evidence, but to teach it as the truth is unacceptable (in my opinion). They have not proven evolution to be true. It is just one interpretation of the evidence that we see displayed in nature, just as creation is another interpretation of the evidence. Both creationists and evolutionists have the same science, the same facts; i.e. we have the same science of chemistry, physics, etc, and we also have the same facts or evidences, i.e. we have the same rocks, the same stars, germs, mutations, planet, moon, etc. \n \n So hence, the battle between evolution and creation is not one over the evidence or over science, but how people interpret those evidences. I have a new proposition, why not just teach some science, and let the kids interpret what and how they want to? We don't need to be teaching evolution in physics and biology. Just teach the facts, just teach some science -- not philosophies (evolution). I am not saying that creation should belong in schools, but it belongs just as much as evolution does, it is just another interpretation of the evidence. It is just as \"scientific\" as evolution because it uses the same science and the same facts -- just different interpretations, or different stories  to explain  how things came into being. \n \n Evolution takes the naturalistic side and rejects the existence of a creator God, while creation includes a creator God who made everything in a matter of days (EST, Earth Standard Time) about 6000 years ago. That is the only difference, the interpretation; i.e. the science is the same. You have got to remember that evolution is just a theory, not a fact. It has most definitely not been proved to be true.\n \n Btw, creation is not blind faith. Many of the evidences make much more sense when interpreted from a creation view point. emoticon_smile",

Firstly your question is already wrecked, because what is an assumption? An assumption is something that science can neither prove nor disprove. So is your question an attempt at making humour? I will answer it anyway, for one, design. Why should an accidental and purely naturalistic processes produce design and complexity?

   "I do not think that evolution should be taught as if it is the absolute truth.\n\n It isn't. It is taught as science, specifically, biology. There is no such thing as absolute truth in science. Evolution is certainly true since it has been observed, and the theories have been tested again and again, but there is no pretense of absolute truth.\n \nIt is okay (I guess) to teach it as one interpretation of the evidence, but to teach it as the truth is unacceptable (in my opinion).\n\n Wouldn't it be nice if you had learned what you were talking about before you spoke? Evolution is not an interpretation of the evidence. Evolution is the evidence and the theories explain why we think that evolution is occuring. There is no doubt that evolution happens.\n \nThey have not proven evolution to be true.\n\n Science doesn't prove. It explains and it tests the explanations. Evolution has been observed and the explanations have been tested again and again. The theory of evolution is so secure that essentiallly every biologist in the world accepts the theory as essentially correct. In fact, the only objections to evolutionary theory seem to be for religious reasons and the mistaken assertion that there is evidence for creationsim.\n \nIt is just one interpretation of the evidence that we see displayed in nature, just as creation is another interpretation of the evidence.\n\n It is dishonest to imply that you have reached your belief in creationism because of an examination of the evidence. Why don't you go to the thread entitled \"Evidence of Evolution\" and give us the creationist interpretation of that evidence. Be sure to show how the telomeric sequences that have been found in human chromosome 2 are a prediction of creationism. Please offer a single discovery that has been based on a creationist interpretation of the evidence.\n \nBoth creationists and evolutionists have the same science, the same facts; i.e. we have the same science of chemistry, physics, etc, and we also have the same facts or evidences, i.e. we have the same rocks, the same stars, germs, mutations, planet, moon, etc.\n\n That is misleading. Creationism is a rejection of science. To reject all of the major theories of every major field of science and then claim that \"we have the same science\" is ridiculous. If that is true then you can certainly explain why SN 1987 A has been measured to be about 170,000 light years distant. If you wish to claim that you interpret the evidence differently, then you will have to explain direct measurements of the parallax, the observed decay in the decay of the emissions in Co-57 and Co-56. You see, if you wish to claim that SN 1987 A is not 170,000 light years away, then we certainly don't have the same math, and if make claims about changing decay rates, then we certainly don't have the same physics.\n \nSo hence, the battle between evolution and creation is not one over the evidence or over science, but how people interpret those evidences.\n\n Right. Science is based on a testing of the explanations for the evidence. It is not a matter of interpretation. But then, neither is creation. Creationism begins with the conclusions and then offerse ad hoc \"explanations\".\n \nI have a new proposition, why not just teach some science, and let the kids interpret what and how they want to?\n\n Because the purpose of science is not necessarily to fill their heads with facts. It is to teach how the universe operates and how science arrives at the answers it offers. The kids don't have the understanding to decide what is and is good science. Moreover they are swayed by emotion, and in some cases religous fervor. The point of science is not to present every possible answer and to let the kids decide. Science education should present the best answers we have for what is observed. As was observed by Theodosius Dobzhansky, a geneticist and one of the founders of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory, \"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\"\n \nWe don't need to be teaching evolution in physics and biology.\n\n Since physics does not deal with hereditary changes in populations of living organisms over time, evolution is not taught in physics. Learn what you are talking about. And we do need to teach evolution in biology.\n \nJust teach the facts, just teach some science -- not philosophies (evolution).\n\n We do. And then we explain why we can observe those facts. Science is not philosophy. You seem to want to reduce science to the memorization of unrelated facts.\n \nI am not saying that creation should belong in schools, but it belongs just as much as evolution does, it is just another interpretation of the evidence.\n\n Incorrect. According to the Supreme Court of the Unites States creationism is religion, pure and simple. As such it has no place in public school science classrooms. It may be taught in classes of mythology, or classes of comparative religion. On the other hand, the SCOTUS has stated that the theory of evolution is science. Science is not just the interpretation of observations. To state so is a demonstration of a fundamental ignorance of the subjece.\n \nIt is just as \"scientific\" as evolution because it uses the same science and the same facts -- just different interpretations, or different stories to explain how things came into being.\n\n The present the evidence, offer an explanation for that evidence, make a prediction that is a consequence of the evidence, design an experiment to test the prediction and present the results. Better yet, tell up about 10 articles of creation science that have been published in scientific journals in the past year. If it is the same science, then I am sure that you agree that creation science should be reported in the same journals. Offer one discovery in the any field of science that is based on creationism.\n \nEvolution takes the naturalistic side and rejects the existence of a creator God,\n\n Again you display your ignorance. Naturalism does not reject the super natural. With just a little thought you could see why. Naturalism is the study of what is natural. It is limited in that study because it lacks the tools to study the supernatural. If you think that I am wrong, then please tell me by what means you quantify your god. Do you measure mass? velocity? refractive index? Exactly what about your god can be studied by naturalism? Science makes no assertion either for or against the existance of any god because such considerations are beyond the scope and power of science. As a matter of fact, naturalism rejects the existence of a creator God in exactly the same way that plumbing does.\n \nwhile creation includes a creator God who made everything in a matter of days (EST, Earth Standard Time) about 6000 years ago.\n\n Prepostrous mythology. Is there any evidence that this is true or are you just basing it on a book of mythology written by nomadic herdsmen?\n \nThat is the only difference, the interpretation; i.e. the science is the same.\n\n Nonsense. In order to hold that mythology you must reject all of modern science.\n \nYou have got to remember that evolution is just a theory, not a fact.\n\n And you have got to remember that gravity is a theory; it is a theory that the earth is a sphere; it is a theory that the earth orbits the sun; it is a theory that germs cause diseases; it is a theory that sound travels by the compression of gas molecules; it is a theory that moderated neutrons will cause the fission of certain isotopes of uranium.\n \n Do you actually know what a theory is? The question is retorical since it is clear that you do not. You seem to believe that it is some sort of guess or speculation. The definition from your Little Golden Dictionary is not the definition used by scientists. Theories do not grow up to become facts. The facts are on the bottom in science. Theories explain the facts. In science, a theory is as good as it gets.\n \nIt has most definitely not been proved to be true.\n\n Except science does not prove the truth of anything. It makes your statement gibberish. And, of course, the major theories of evolution have been tested so well that it would be foolish without some extraordinary reason to doubt them. And certainly, creationism has been proven to be false, so where does that leave you?\n \nBtw, creation is not blind faith.\n\n It most certainly is. You said so above. That where you start with the presumption of a creation about 6000 years ago. And then you reject science in order to be able to hold that belief.\n \nMany of the evidences make much more sense when interpreted from a creation view point.\n\n Nonsense. The present the evidence, offer an explanation based on creationism, give a prediction that is necessarily true, design an experiment and test the prediction. Show why your prediction can't have a naturalistic explanation. I ask and I ask and I ask for evidence of creation and no one ever give any. All we hear is the views of uneducated creationists who don't know what science is or how it works, what evolution is, and don't even know what a scientific theory is.",

I'll let 7th Arty speak for himself if he feels there is a need.\n \n Though name-calling certainly is witnessed in these threads on both 'sides' of the issue, my experience has been mostly that responses to creationist views on these forums do not appear insulting. Rather, they are reasonable replies to mostly unreasonable questions and assertions.\n \n Imagine this scenario: A 'creationist' comes to this board and says, \"I recognize that all the known evidence we are aware of today supports the theory of evolution, and no evidence exists that we are aware of that supports the idea of a literal interpretation of Genesis. Yet I still believe that God created the world in six days less than 10,000 years ago. I believe that evidence will be found that supports my belief. Regardless of whether it is found or not, I believe that the world was created less than 10,000 years ago because the bible says that this is how it happened. I believe that the bible is inspired by God and is therefore true. I believe that humans are special and set apart from the rest of the animals. I believe that when I die and go to heaven, I will understand exactly how God made all life on earth, and everyone else will see that regardless of what evidence they think they might have to support the theory of evolution, God supercedes all evidence because God is all-powerful and all-knowing and can do anything.\"\n \n This hypothetical creationist is being honest. Personally, I find that respectable. This person is not being reasonable... but they have no obligation to be reasonable. They can believe whatever they wish to believe.\n \n The more typical scenario on these forums is that a creationist posts what they believe to be proof that the theory of evolution is not valid. (Usually this is propaganda from various creationist websites.) Yet, none of the supposed 'proof' ever holds up under any amount of scrutiny. Much of it does not have integrity (i.e. quotes taken out of context, altered videos, blatant lies, etc.). Creationists on this forum (and others) typically show that they have not taken the time to educate themselves about basic scientific principles, nor about the observed facts that support the theory of evolution. Rather, the typical scenario is that they copy and paste propaganda without really understanding any of it. If they DID understand it, it is likely they would see it for what it is.\n \n Close_Slave_Can -- If you or anyone wishes to believe that the earth was created in six 24-hour periods less than 10,000 years ago... Great! You are welcome to do so. That takes a huge amount of faith! If you or anyone claims that there is evidence (outside of the bible, of course) that supports your belief... well, then you will be told over and over and over again that your claim is not true. Why? Because it is simply not true. That doesn't mean you have to change your beliefs. But if you wish to discuss evidence and debate the validity of creationism in the face of reality, then you are setting yourself up for disappointment no matter how you look at it.\n \n I think it's fair to say that most (if not all) creationists believe what they believe for religious reasons. From my perspective, what many creationists fail to realize is that accepting the reality of known evidence and giving up the idea of a literal interpretation of Genesis does not mean that they must give up their faith or their belief in an all-powerful God.",

   "I would be willing to bet that 7th arty has no tolerance for creationists\n\n I have no tolerance for anyone who opposes something without understanding what they oppose. That is generally true of creationists. Mostly creationists parrot what they have heard from a few others who may or may not know that what they are saying is wrong. Creationism depends on the fact that most followers and many of the leaders are scientific illiterates.\n \n I'll give you an example. Mr. Kent Hovind, although his only legitimate degree is from a Bible College claims to be a scientist and claims advanced degrees (from a diploma mill). In reference to the evidence for the reversals of the earth's magnetic field that is preserved in the sea floor along both sides of the mid-Atlantic ridge Hovind states that what is there are areas of greater or less magnetism and not reversals. He states that there is no place on earth where a north seeking compass points south.\n \n Now if you don't understand then you are in danger of being duped by the likes of Hovind. I'll explain why that is such tripe for anyone who is interested.\n \n Gallup has conducted polls every few years for a couple of decades. They have shown that the more educated a person is, the less likely he is to be a creationist. It becomes even worse with anyone educated in science such that more than 95% of all scientists in the U.S. accept the theory of evolution. More than 99% of biologists and geologists do.\n \nand still think it wise to advise newcomers to prepare to choose words carefully\n\n Doesn't a reasonable person do that anyway? Why would you not try to express yourself clearly and in ways that are not contradictory?\n \nor prepare to be insulted because thats what is currently happening to me.\n\n So mentioning that your posts are confused and that I don't understand them is an insult? why don't you just think through what you are trying to say? I mean! What kind of an idea is it to propose not teaching evolution in the Bible belt? Who would propose that uneducated students should be able to decide for themselves what is and is not good science? I just don't see any sense in that sort of talk. If that is insulting to you, then too bad. It is my opinion of your ideas. Nothing was directed at you personally.\n \n In fact, I reread this entire thread and found no insults.

I also know that in every case that has been considered by the Supreme Court they have reached the decision that creationism is religion and therefore has no place in the science classroom. I refer you to Epperson v. Arkansas (393 U.S. 97), Edwards v. Aguillard (482 U.S. 578) among others. I can also cite some U.S. District Court cases that weren't appealed or were denied cert by the SCOTUS. Would you like to talk about the case law concerned with the teaching of creationism?\n \nUsing this faulty assumption I instantly assumed people saw the connection between teaching morality and evolution and did not explain it.\n\n There's where you are wrong, you see? There is no connection between the teaching of morality and evolution. None what so ever. Believe it or not, evolutionists are moral people. In fact, many of them are Christians.\n \nI will also admit that you are smarter than me.\n\n Really? At least I think through what I am saying and I learn the basics of what I oppose.\n \nAnd the vast majority of times you give posts containing interesting information in a very clear fashion, much more so than me\n\n Thanks.\n \nHowever explain this\n ----------------------------------------\n Quote from Close:\n Originally Posted by Close_slave_can\n I beleive in the macroevolution, \n \n 7th reply:\n I don't believe in scientific theories. I accept them as the best explainations for the observed data - especially in those areas where I have some education and experience. I believe things for which I have no evidence or almost no evidence.\n \n Websters dictionary defintion of believe:\n [v] accept as true; take to be true;\n -----------------------------------------\n\n To \"believe\" something in the sense that creationist mean is to accept without evidence. It is a common ploy to claim that evolutionists \"believe\" in evolution just like creationists \"believe\" in creationism. The intent is to try to reduce science to the level of religion so that it becomes guesses and acceptance based on faith and baseless assumptions. That is not the case. I don't \"believe\" in evolution in that sense. I have studied the evidence. I have been studying the evidence for years. I read papers and books and attend lectures by leading researchers (as I did tonight). I accept evolutionary theories as the best explanations we have for the observed facts (evidence), but I recognize that new facts may cause the theories to be amended.\n \n Creationism, on the other hand, begins from the conclusions. Those conclusions come from a literal reading of the mythology of ancient, nomadic herdsmen, most of which they picked up from other cultures. Essentially, creationism starts with the conclusions and then selects, distorts and ignores the evidence so as to make religion look scientific.\n \nAlso explain this\n ----------------------------------------\n Quote from 7th directed at Close:\n Do you know what science is? Why do you keep babbling about things being proved?\n \n Quoted by 7th_Arty:\n Those are examples of macroevolution beyond any doubt.\n Also quoted by 7th_Arty: \n I reread this entire thread and found no insults.\n \n Now I don't understand how anyone would think the phrase\n \"why do you keep babbling about...\" is a polite\n\n I never claimed that I was being polite. I didn't insult you. What you want is that I respect your views as valid and rational. In my opinion they are not. To say that you are babbling is my opinion of your opinion. It is not an attack on you but on your manner of expression, specifically that you don't think your answers through to the conclusions. You aren't thinking, you are parroting without understanding what others have told you. You haven't made the effort to learn what scientists think science is and how it works. You haven't made the effort to learn the fundamentals of evolutionary theory. How do you know that you oppose them?\n \nAnd I don't understand how anyone can be totally against the word prove and use a phrase like \"beyond any doubt\", if you have no doubt isn't that proof?\n\n No. It is an observation of fact. You are confused by the several levels of meaning of the word evolution:\n \n 1) there is the definition of evolution. Which events are to be considered evolution and which are not. Evolution is a change in the allele frequency of a population over time. In other words, if it isn't a change in the hereditary makeup of a population across generations, it isn't evolution.\n \n 2) evolution has been observed. Events that meet the above definition are evident and pervasive. That evolution happens is \"beyond any doubt.\" I have given several examples of evolution that we can see happening. Polar bears/brown bears. Herring gulls to lesser black-backed gulls around the globe. Salamanders around the central valley of California. Green warblers around the Tibetan plateau. There are several examples of the speciation of fruit flies in the lab. Most laboratory strains of fruit fly are no longer able to interbreed with the populations from which they were derived. Peppered moths, in only 150 years went from all light colored to almost all black and back to almost all white. The color of the peppered moth is controlled by a single gene.\n \n 3) The theories that explain the above observations of the facts that meet the definition. The theories also explain our observations of the historical events preserved in the fossil record. Theories of evolution explain the nested hierarchy we observe in living things. Evolutionary theory explains (but first it predicted) the transitional forms that we find in the fossil record that have a range of primitive feathers that become more modern in more recent fossils. Evolutionary theory explains why fossils like Archaeopteryx have killing claws on its feet, grasping claws on its wings, teeth, and a long boney tail - just like a dinosaur.\n \n But theories are never \"proven.\" There is always the presumption that there may be some undiscovered fact that may cause the revision of every theory. Theories are our best attempts to explain what we observe.\n \n Let me give you an example. Waaaaay back in the 1600s Newton formulated the first theories of relativity and gravity. They worked for a long time. First Maxwell (in his theory that unified electricity and magnetism) and then Einstein demonstrated that Newton was wrong.\n \nOn a different thread\n ----------------------------------------\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Defender\n Name me an animal that swings its tail like a cedar. \n \n Reply from 7th_Arty:\n I presume that you mean \"Name an animal...\" rather than expressing a desire to be called by some animal name.\n \n Fact of life: \"Name me animal\" is a common expression so are you making a joke?\n\n Because \"Name me an animal...\" in illiterate English. It isn't correct. It doesn't matter who uses it or how common it is, it is incorrect. \"Name me an animal...\" asks that I give you an animal name. The first thing that popped into my mind was the name of a male burro - but I refrained because that might be interpreted as an insult. If someone agrees with me and they respond with, \"Your right,\" before I even get to the next word I am wondering about my left. If someone writes that \"their are three things to consider,\" I have to go back and read it again to translate it into literate English. How sad that people who don't know the difference between \"too,\" \"two,\" and \"to\", or \"they're\", \"there\" and \"their\" feel that they are qualified to give instruction in topics that they have never studied. If you think that it was an insult when I referred to your comments as babble, then how do you think I feel when you and others attempt to instruct me in evolutionary biology? It's an insult. And I take extreme exception.\n \n I hope that helped.\n \n Let me say this. I will never tell you something that I do not know to be true - that is, either a fact of observation or the best scientific theory to date. I will also offer alternate theories where appropriate. I do so now and always did so for my students. I always presented or allowed for discussion any valid question of science. In fact, I once taught a course in which I allowed that every Friday any student could present any question for consideration, as long as he/she could demonstrate a scientific basis for the question. My only promise was that if I didn't know the answer, I would make an effort to find out. There were some questions that I couldn't answer and for which I couldn't find the answers. I think I would do better today. For that one session per week, my class became the desirable section, because it was fun, funny, educational and a chance to stump the teacher.\n \n As for presenting \"alternate theories\" in evolution, it is actually quite standard. The speaker at the lecture I attended tonight presented the pros and cons of 7 theories specific to the topic, only one of which was his theory. Only one did he reject out of hand for lack of evidence. I have no doubt that everyone there understood which theory he favored - it is, after all, his theory. However, not a single remark had anything to do with creationism, faith, religion, or any god. As is true for all teaching of science with which I am familiar, alternatives are presented with evidence on both sides of the question. The limits in secondary school are determined by the time available and the ability of the students to understand the presentation, not by how acceptable the theory is.\n \n The problem for creationists is that they don't have a theory. There is no such thing as a scientific theory of creation. It is dogma.\n \n Have a nice day. I will since I am off work today.",

   "@7th_Arty\n Sorry I still don't understand\n Do you claim Macroevolution is something beyond doubt?\n Do you claim Macroevolution is part of science and science is not about proving things?\n Do claim that if something is beyond doubt you do not have proof?\n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Edit: I wll admit these questions are not entirely honest. It was a cheap ploy to get 7th_Arty to list a bunch of definitions for the word evolution and to get him to tell me were I was using the wrong definition. I could then get some of 7th_Arty's sentences and interpret them using the wrong definition and accuse 7th of being confused. But although I would enjoy my silly little game no one else would. I will accept that 7th has a different way of looking at the world and I cannot claim my way is superior. I think calling someone semiliterate for saying \"their it is\" is a totally unacceptable insult and 7th thinks it is just a statement of fact. Maybe 7th is right because if everyone was as lax with English as me the English language would degenerate into gibberish. An example of my heathen ways I do not think apostrophes are at all necessary because you can always work out what is going on and I only use them to please others. I would not use them in letters to my friends. \n ------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n \n\n To \"believe\" something in the sense that creationist mean is to accept without evidence.

I gave you a challenge, one that you don't seem to be able to meet since I have challenged you more than once in the past.\n \n Really, though. Give up your policeman complex. These threads have a habit of wandering off on tangents. If you don't like it, then you can continue to address whatever you think is the central question.

I guess you've got your answers all lined up and are offended when you can't use them.\n \n As for whether creation has been suggested as an alternative for evolution, it has. I have been dealing with creationists for more than a decade and creation is very seriously suggested as an alternative for evolution. First creationists tried to ban the teaching of evolution (the Supreme Court said no dice), followed by efforts to replace evolution with creation (the Supreme Court said no dice), then as an equal time theory (the Supreme Court said no dice).

You want to eliminate the teaching of the current scientific theories that conflict with your religious beliefs. And it is more than evolution, isn't it? Is it OK to teach that the universe is 13.7 billion years old and resulted from the expansion of a singularity in space/time? The earth is 4.6 billion years old and life has existed for 3.8 billion years. There were no 6 days of creation about 6,000 years ago.\n \n So what is being taught is the current scientific theories to the extent that the students are capable of understanding and to the extent that time is available. That has been determined to be appropriate for the teaching of science by the SCOTUS. You can pretend that there is some discussion about theory and fact and scientific proof.

It requires an increase of information.\n \n With that in mind, this is my response to point two, one of my quotes in an ealier thread... \n... to my knowledge, what the finches, and more clearly - the Chihuahua and Great Dane are demonstrating is loss of information through change in gene frequency or elimantion of some genes. (ie - genes for smaller beaks, or genes for smaller dogs) Since this kind of evolution has indeed created new species of dog and finch according to the defintions I've seen, it could be said that macro-evolution was proved (if it is change above species level). However, showing that loss of information can create new species can't prove the progressive evolution from the first self-replicator, since that requires increase of information.\n\n \n As to point three, that's where I am likely over my head. I would like to note that transitional fossils are a weak point as far as evidence goes.

Yet it seems to me that many of its proponents are pretty dogmatic. So my question is why not at least present the theories which object to naturalistic evolution? The ID group claim that their theory has nothing to do with religion, indeed, some would be insulted if you said they were religiously motivated, or even religious (according to Hugh Ross - although, his work is in astronomy and physics). I don't think they should be given equal time, but to present evolution as a monolithic fact when there are scientists who disagree with it does a disservice to scientific inquiry.",

   "First, I see that 7th Ardy argued a few posts up that:\n\n No. I didn't argue anything. I was explaining the meanings of the words as used by evolutionary biologists. Many creationists seem confused. They don't seem to be able to distinguish the definition of a process from the observations of the process from the theories that explain the process. It seems that you still share that confusion.\n \nAs to point one, I agree, and would give my definitions of Microevolution and Progressive Evolution. (The term Macroevolution is taken by 'change above the species level', apparently)\n\n It's nice that you agree, but I wasn't making a point. I was giving a definition. That definition is agreed to by all evolutionary biologists. Biologists rarely use the terms microevolution and macroevolution. They were once in vogue as applied to a specific theory that has since been discredited. But the words are still around. Microevolution is evolution below the level of species and macroevolution is above that level. I have given examples of both. In fact, I have given examples of organisms that have accumulated enough microevolution that macroevolution has occurred - the ring species.\n \nMicroevolution is a change in allele frequency of a population, as we have indeed observed, which does not result in an increase of information.\n\n Define information as applicable to biological organisms. You need to define your terms and then show that you are correct. You are arguing from assertion. It is implicit in your points that you believe that information cannot increase. Show me why I should not reject everything you say out of hand because it is so vague. What about cases of microevolution that are an increase in information? What about those that are neither an increase or a decrease?\n \nProgressive evolution refers to the progress from the first cell or self-replicator, to the current diversity and complexity of species. It requires an increase of information.\n\n There is no such thing. Define progress. What you are calling progress is an accident of perspective. There is no requirement for progress in any theory of evolution. Living organisms change and they are likely to change in all sorts of ways. The only requirement is that the change is somehow adaptive. Since the first living thing was probably very, very simple, there would be only two ways for it to evolve, towards a different but still very, very simple organism, or towards a different and less simple organism. And again with the information. What are you talking about?\n \nWith that in mind, this is my response to point two, one of my quotes in an ealier thread...\n\n There was no point two. You don't seem to have read very carefully. My three points were definitions of how biologists use the term \"evolution.\" Doesn't it seem a bit silly to argue against the vocabulary used by professionals? Do you argue with your mechanic about what he calls a carburator?\n \n... to my knowledge, what the finches, and more clearly - the Chihuahua and Great Dane are demonstrating is loss of information through change in gene frequency or elimantion of some genes. (ie - genes for smaller beaks, or genes for smaller dogs)\n\n So what? You seem to be defining information as genetic diversity. Since Chihuahuas and Great Danes are the result of artificial selection that reduced the genetic diversity you claim that this is a loss of information. OK. I'll accept that. In fact, there are several processes of natural evolution that tend to reduce the genetic diversity of populations. Here's three: natural selection, sexual selection, genetic drift. By the way, a change in allele frequency is not a loss of information since it isn't the loss of the allele (or as you incorrectly state, the gene).\n \nSince this kind of evolution has indeed created new species of dog and finch according to the defintions I've seen, it could be said that macro-evolution was proved (if it is change above species level).\n\n Nope. Macroevolution is observed. It is one of the observations that support the theory of evolution. No one is trying to \"prove\" macroevolution. So we can see in the case of artificial selection how it takes place, and we can see that corresponding events take place in natural populations, so we observe that evolution is taking place and then devise theories to explain the processes.\n \nHowever, showing that loss of information can create new species can't prove the progressive evolution from the first self-replicator, since that requires increase of information.\n\n Again, the observation that life has chanaged from simple organisms to more complex organisms over 3.8 billion years is one of perspective. Evolutionary theory does not include the concept of progress or increase of complexity.\n \nAs to point three, that's where I am likely over my head.\n\n Actually, it looks like you were in over your head at point one - since none of them were points.\n \nI would like to note that transitional fossils are a weak point as far as evidence goes. To paraphrase Stephen Jay Gould (as you have no doubt heard many times) the trade secret of palentology is the lack of transitionals, that the evolutionary tree that we see is virtually all inference, however reasonable that inference may be.\n\n Right. And you have probably heard Gould's answer to your paraphrase many times too. Just in case, here it is.\n \nSince we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists -whether through design or stupidity, I do not know - as admitting that the fossil record contains no transitional forms. Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level, but are abundant between larger groups.\n\n So which is your reason for taking Gould's quote out of context?\n \nMy last note refers to the fact that theories are never set in stone, as evidenced by Newtons mechanical physics. With that in mind, it makes sense that we should not automatically react to any theory that upsets the status quo. Questioning is vital to Science. I can't say whether evolution is proven without doubt, or in serious jeporday. I've heard both claimed. It is true that evolution is a widely accepted theory, extremely so. Yet it seems to me that many of its proponents are pretty dogmatic. So my question is why not at least present the theories which object to naturalistic evolution?\n\n I don't know. Why do you think that scientists are dogmatic about gravity. Maybe it is possible that the moon is being pulled around the earth by invisible fairies. And of course, we shouldn't be dogmatic about the germ theory of disease. Maybe it is evil spirits that cause the cold, or chickenpox and the like.\n \n The ID group claim that their theory has nothing to do with religion, indeed, some would be insulted if you said they were religiously motivated, or even religious (according to Hugh Ross - although, his work is in astronomy and physics).\n\n Yeah. The battle against the evils of evolution makes strange bedfellows, doesn't it? But the bulk of the IDers are religiously motivated. And none are basing anything on science.\n \nI don't think they should be given equal time, but to present evolution as a monolithic fact when there are scientists who disagree with it does a disservice to scientific inquiry.\n\n So anyone who calls himself a scientist should be able to present his particular bit of superstition in science classes across the country. what a good idea. Don't you think it would be a good idea that there be a scientific basis to these disagreements?",

   "As to point three, that's where I am likely over my head. I would like to note that transitional fossils are a weak point as far as evidence goes. To paraphrase Stephen Jay Gould (as you have no doubt heard many times) the trade secret of palentology is the lack of transitionals, that the evolutionary tree that we see is virtually all inference, however reasonable that inference may be.\n\n \n I'm having this same problem on another message board. Everytime I present information about how good the fossil record is, and how there is an embarrassment of riches as regards to transitional fossils, people will respond by some quote implying that transitional fossils are rare instead of actually dealing with the evidence that exists!\n \n Your quote is wrong - either the person is wrong or (like in this case) the quote is taken out of context. There is no important lack of transitional fossils. Some specific lineages are missing - for example, we don't have a record of the evolution of bats from tree dwelling non-flying mammals. Some individual pieces are missing - we don't yet have the links between Australopithecus (which most definitely are transitional between humans and non-human apes) and the common human/chimpanzee ancestor. But so many lineages are so very well recorded that simply producing a quote indicating that they are lacking is pretty close to a lie.",

   "I'll save you guys the trouble. I'll get the paper for you.\n \n The remark in question was in Natural History magazine in May 1977. (Gould, 1977, Nat. Hist., 86(5): 12-16)\n \n Most of Gould's articles were republished in his series of books but I can find no reference to that one, so it seems to have been in one of his articles that weren't republished in one of his books. You can find the quote on lots and lots of fundy christian web sites. It is always out of context with just the part that the creationists like.\n \nThe extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as the trade secret of paleontology (study of fossils) -- In any local area, a species does not arise gradually by the steady transformation of its ancestors, it appears all at once and fully formed.\n\n Gould was discussing speciation and punctuated equilibrium and was discussing transitionals between species. I can expand on what Gould was talking about if any of the creationists are interested. I doubt it, but I'll make the offer if anyone is interested in learning.\n \n I quoted Gould's response to people taking the quote out of context but I'll do it again. This remark was made in an article entitled Evolution as Fact and Theory in Discover magazine, May 1981, but was republished in Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes: Further Reflections in Natural History. 1983. W.W. Norton & Co. New York.\n \nSince we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists--whether through design or stupidity, I do not know--as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms. Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level, but they are abundant between larger groups.\n\n \n I hadn't seen a creationist who actually was either dishonest enough or uneducated enough to use that quote in some time. Just think. The original is 27 years old and has been answered again and again, and yet creationists continue to pass it on to their gullible brethren. Gould characterized those who use that quote out of context as either dishonest or stupid some 23 years ago.\n \n I've never had the ambition to try to dig up that article and gather more of the context. Perhaps I should so that I can place it in the proper context. But on the other hand, creationists wouldn't pay attention to the context anyway. That's the nature of creationist quote mining.",

   "To 7th_Arty:\n Firstly you try to define what evolution is:\n \n1) there is the definition of evolution. Which events are to be considered evolution and which are not. Evolution is a change in the allele frequency of a population over time. In other words, if it isn't a change in the hereditary makeup of a population across generations, it isn't evolution.\n \n That is a pretty broad definition, one that dances in both real science and historical science - historical science that is driven by philosophies. So any change in a population over time is evolution? Even if it is information loosing? You see, I perfer to use the GTE - General Theory of Evolution - that is basically molecules to man evolution, which is information gaining. The so-called evolution that we observe, such as anti-biotic resistance, is what I would call \"variation with in a kind\" and is an information loosing process, i.e. mutation. So in that respect, evolution is a very confusing definition. \n \n Antibiotic and pesticide resistance is also what creation would predict, because it is an information loosing process, in the case of antibiotic resistance, every bacteria produces a small amount of enzyme that disables and destroys the antibiotics. But since very little of the enzyme is produced, the bacteria is subsquently surrounded and destroyed by the anti-biotics. So, if the bacteria has a certain mutation that disables the bacteria's ability to control how much of this enzyme it produces, more and more enzymes are being produced and destroy the antibiotics. Hence, the bacteria aquires antibiotic resistance, through the loss of an ability, i.e. information lost.\n \n \n2) evolution has been observed. Events that meet the above definition are evident and pervasive. That evolution happens is \"beyond any doubt.\" I have given several examples of evolution that we can see happening. Polar bears/brown bears. Herring gulls to lesser black-backed gulls around the globe. Salamanders around the central valley of California. Green warblers around the Tibetan plateau. There are several examples of the speciation of fruit flies in the lab. Most laboratory strains of fruit fly are no longer able to interbreed with the populations from which they were derived. Peppered moths, in only 150 years went from all light colored to almost all black and back to almost all white. The color of the peppered moth is controlled by a single gene.\n \n \n Firstly, let us deal with the peppered moths argument. Don't you know? The peppered moths argument for evolution was a recently exposed fraud! Now some of the science journals (e.g. Nature  396(6706):35-36) admit that it's bunk! These moths never even rested on the trunks in the daylight! To bolster the story, dead moths were glued or pinned onto trees to provide impressive photography, for more information see Creation  magazine 21(3):56, 1999. Even if the it was not a fraud, it would still not be any evidence for the GTE. We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution, we have light and dark moths after the industrial revolution. The only thing that would have changed would have been the population ratios. This is just (if it were not a fraud) an example of natural selection - which creationists do accept and believe in, because it is what we observe.\n \n You also talk about the fruit flies in the labs. You wonder why they don't breed with their original species!!?? Because the poor things are being bombarded with radiation just to produce mutations. These mutations can cause legs to grow out of their heads, for example. These mutations never actually provide new information, they just screw up the existing information and make survival for the creature harder. This is the opposite of what is need for the GTE. Once again, this is just variation with in a kind, not evolution. \n \n You also talk about polar bears/brown bears and the birds. This is not evidence of GTE. There are are at least 8 species of the \"Bear family\" (Ursidae), including the polar bear and the brown bear, Amercian black bears and so on. While both evolutionists and creationists consider these specialized characteristics to be adaptations to the environment through natural selection, the two camps are poles apart as to how most of this variation came about in the first place. \n \n Evolutionists believe that the genetic (hereditary) information (which supplies the &#8216;recipe&#8217; to construct such specialized features in the developing embryo) all arose by an accumulation of copying errors (mutations). Any &#8216;good&#8217; errors which helped the creature to survive were passed on. In this way, they believe that these design features are all the result of these copying mistakes, accumulated by selection over millions of years. \n \n Creationists, however, while accepting that all of today&#8217;s bears probably descended from a single bear kind, do not believe that the information in the &#8216;recipes&#8217; for all these design features arose by chance. No-one has ever observed any biological process adding information!\n \n A better explanation is that virtually all the necessary information was already there in the genetic makeup of the first bears, a population created by God with vast genetic potential for variation. In this, the bear kind has \"diversified\" through time to all the species that we see today. Certain species would have taken different parts of the original genome with them as they adapted to their individual environments (through natural selecion).\n \n This doesn&#8217;t mean that all of the features of today&#8217;s bears would have been on obvious display back then. A simple example would be the way in which mongrel dogs obviously had the potential to develop all the different breeds we see today. Thus, there was no actual poodle to be seen among mongrel dogs hundreds of years ago, but by looking closely at many of them, one would have seen at least some of the individual features found in today&#8217;s poodles popping up here and there. For more information on this interesting topic of the diversity of bears, I would invite you to check out:\n [URL=http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v20/i4/bears.asp[/URL] \n \n The same kind of thing can be shown for the birds that you mentioned, just variation within a kind through mutations and natural selection, i.e. information loosing processes.\n \n \n3) The theories that explain the above observations of the facts that meet the definition. The theories also explain our observations of the historical events preserved in the fossil record. Theories of evolution explain the nested hierarchy we observe in living things. Evolutionary theory explains (but first it predicted) the transitional forms that we find in the fossil record that have a range of primitive feathers that become more modern in more recent fossils. Evolutionary theory explains why fossils like Archaeopteryx have killing claws on its feet, grasping claws on its wings, teeth, and a long boney tail - just like a dinosaur.\n \n \n Creation has, like evolution, made many predictions that is based on the Bible. Such predictions include rapid variation within a kind, the mass extinction of species through the flood, and through the following ice age. We would expect to see millions of dead things laid down by sedimetary rock in the fossil record -- and that is what we see. We see fossils where there are animals that are still in the middle of giving birth, eating food -- probably from Noah's flood. We would also expect that there is no observed SNRs (Super Nova Remenants) in the third stage - and that is what we get - although talkorigins.com totally screws up the scientific evidence - they totally change it to suit their own story. They have no references and the article was not even written by a Ph.D. scientist - unlike the Answers in Genesis article. \n \n The supposed transitional form called Archaeopteryx is not a transitional fossil. For one, it has fully formed flying feathers (including asymmetric vanes and ventral, reinforcing furrows as in modern flying birds), the classical elliptical wings of moder woodland birds and a large wishbone for attachment of muscles responsible for the downstroke of the wings (Science  259(5096):790-793, February 5, 1993). \n \n If you know anything about birds, than you would know that \"asymmetric vanes\" mean that the bird is a very powerful flyer. This is very powerful evidence to suggest that the wings are not transitional. Alan Feduccia, a world authority on birds at the university of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an evolutionist himself, disagrees with the scientists who claim that Archaeopteryx is a transitional form says: \"Paleontologiss have tried to turn Archaeopteryx into an earth-bound, feathered dinosaur. But it's not. It is a bird, a pearching bird. And no amount of \"paleobabble\" is going to change that.\" (Cited in V. Morell, \"Archaeopteryx: Early bird catches a can of worms,\" Science  259(5059):764-65, February 5, 1993). \n \n I would also invite you to look at the following site about the fossil record and the fossils that are in it:\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/fossils.asp\n Best wishes,\n astronomyfan87.",

Yet I supplied links and photos of actual transitionals, and indicated that there are a lot more. It's all very nice if SJG claimed that transitionals are very rare, but I think, in light of the information I have provided, it is a good assumption that either SJG was. The point is that some information was provided, and that information has to be dealt with, and simply providing a general quote, out of context, that doesn't address the specific evidence I provided is just avoiding the issue.",

Evolution is a change in the allele frequency of a population over time. In other words, if it isn't a change in the hereditary makeup of a population across generations, it isn't evolution.\n\n\n I didn't try to define evolution, I did define evolution. I gave you the biological definition of evolution. A definition that is acceptable to all evolutionary biologists. That is how evolution is defined by biologists, period. \n \nThat is a pretty broad definition, one that dances in both real science and historical science - historical science that is driven by philosophies.\n\n No. It is quite a narrow definition. It was formulated back in the day of the synthesis of Darwinism and genetics. There is no dancing, no history and no philosophy. Let me say it again. Biological evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time.\n \nSo any change in a population over time is evolution? Even if it is information loosing?\n\n I'll say it again. Biological evolution is a change in the heritable makeup of the genome of a group of interbreeding organisms that takes place over generations. Do you think you have a grasp on it yet?\n \n But to answer your question, No. Not any change in a population over time is evolution. The change must be heritable. The change must be in the relative frequencies of alternate forms of genes. It must be genetic, it must be change, it must take the entire population into account, and it must take place over generations.\n \n There is no requirement about information. You still haven't defined information yet. I guess I was right that by information you mean the amount of genetic diversity. So yes, even changes that result in a reduction of genetic diversity are evolutionary.\n \nYou see, I perfer to use the GTE - General Theory of Evolution - that is basically molecules to man evolution, which is information gaining.\n\n There is no such thing as the \"General Theory of Evolution.\" That was made up by someone with a ministry as a straw man. Since creationists can't attack real evolution or evolutionary theory, they invent straw men and try to knock them down instead. Just as you are doing.\n \n How do you know you disagree with evolutionary theory if you don't even know what it is? Where does it get you to invent definitions that aren't used by evolutionary biologists? Isn't it just wonderful how you disagree with your own definition.\n \nThe so-called evolution that we observe, such as anti-biotic resistance, is what I would call \"variation with in a kind\" and is an information loosing process, i.e. mutation. So in that respect, evolution is a very confusing definition.\n\n Actually, the development of antibiotic resistance is evolution. But now you have introduced another meaningless word. What is a \"kind\". Please be specific so that I will be able to apply that definition to any organism and recognize whether it is a \"kind.\" Please give me examples of the original \"kinds.\" Please point out the specific barriers between kinds and how they operate.\n \n Let me see if I have this straight. A mutation that adds an allele to a genome is a loss of information. And if that new allele spreads through the population, that is also a loss of information. And if for some reason that allele is eliminated from the population, that is a loss of information.\n \n You seem confused and are beginning to babble. Please define biological information.\n \nAntibiotic and pesticide resistance is also what creation would predict, because it is an information loosing process,\n\n Creation would predict no such thing. If you think so, then please give tell un in detail the observations on which this prediction is based and how creation predicts it. You are just making that up.\n \nin the case of antibiotic resistance, every bacteria produces a small amount of enzyme that disables and destroys the antibiotics. But since very little of the enzyme is produced, the bacteria is subsquently surrounded and destroyed by the anti-biotics. So, if the bacteria has a certain mutation that disables the bacteria's ability to control how much of this enzyme it produces, more and more enzymes are being produced and destroy the antibiotics. Hence, the bacteria aquires antibiotic resistance, through the loss of an ability, i.e. information lost.\n\n What absolute nonsense.\n \nFirstly, let us deal with the peppered moths argument. Don't you know? The peppered moths argument for evolution was a recently exposed fraud!\n\n Do you mean the Kettlewell spray painted all of those moths black?\n \nNow some of the science journals (e.g. Nature 396(6706):35-36) admit that it's bunk!\n\n I doubt it. I am sure that If you were to quote the actual article rather than parroting some creationist ministry the story would be different.\n \nThese moths never even rested on the trunks in the daylight!\n\n Actually, they do sometimes. They have been studied for the last 50 years in several studies and all of them support Kettlewell. They are observed on tree truncks sometimes. But that is actually irrelevant. Doesn't matter where they rest during the day, the change of peppered moths from light to dark and then back again is an example of evolution through natural selection.\n \nTo bolster the story, dead moths were glued or pinned onto trees to provide impressive photography, for more information see Creation magazine 21(3):56, 1999.\n\n They lied to you and you believed it. The moths were placed on the tree trunks in order to show the colors against the backgrounds. It was never part of the data and never represented as evidence. But creationists have to lie to make it seem like this wasn't evolution.\n \nEven if the it was not a fraud, it would still not be any evidence for the GTE.\n\n There is no such thing as the GTE. That is a creationist invention.\n \nWe had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution, we have light and dark moths after the industrial revolution.\n\n Actually, we didn't. The first dark moth was observed in 1848. They had become virtually the entire population in industrial areas by 1900 and they stayed that way until around 1950. When the polution was cleaned up the population became mostly white again by the 1990s.\n \nThe only thing that would have changed would have been the population ratios.\n\n Right. The color of the peppered moth is determined by a single gene that has two alleles. The ratios of those alleles changed in the population over generations. The ratios changed twice. That is evolution. A change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time. Funny that.\n \n Now explain to me how Kettlewell managed to paint all of those moths in order to perpatrate that fraud and make everyone think that the population became black in industrial areas.\n \nThis is just (if it were not a fraud) an example of natural selection - which creationists do accept and believe in, because it is what we observe.\n\n Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution. There are others. And if you \"believe in it\", why are you perpetuating the lies about Kettlewell?\n \nYou also talk about the fruit flies in the labs. You wonder why they don't breed with their original species!!?? Because the poor things are being bombarded with radiation just to produce mutations. These mutations can cause legs to grow out of their heads, for example. These mutations never actually provide new information, they just screw up the existing information and make survival for the creature harder.\n\n I see. Since you don't like that either you invent things. I am not talking about flies after being used for any kind of experiment. There are several stocks of fruit flies of known genetic makeup (that's sometimes important) that are maintained as breeding stock. Even though all of those different breeding stocks came from the same source. And yet some of them are unable to breed with each other. Perhaps if you actually learned what you were talking about before you spoke. The breeding stocks aren't bombarded with radiation. The idea is silly.\n \nThis is the opposite of what is need for the GTE. Once again, this is just variation with in a kind, not evolution.\n\n Again, there is no such thing as your GTE. That is a creationist idea and is not relevant to evolutionary biology. You may continue to argue against your straw man if you wish, but you are having a hard time knocking it down. You are making yourself look foolish. Please define kind, including the mechanisms prevent evolution, you know. The barriers between kinds.\n \nYou also talk about polar bears/brown bears and the birds. This is not evidence of GTE.\n\n Of course not. How can I have evidence of something that doesn't exist. The examples I gave are examples of evolution, specifically, macroevolution.\n \nThere are are at least 8 species of the \"Bear family\" (Ursidae), including the polar bear and the brown bear, Amercian black bears and so on. While both evolutionists and creationists consider these specialized characteristics to be adaptations to the environment through natural selection, the two camps are poles apart as to how most of this variation came about in the first place.\n\n I see you didn't understand the point about brown bears and polar bears. Perhaps if you went back and read it again you might understand. I wasn't talking about American black bears, sun bears, or any other kind of bear. I was specifically talking about brown bears - all of which are morphologically indistinguishable, and all of which except those of the ABC islands are genetically indistinguishable. The ABC bears are more like polar bears. And even polar bears can still interbreed with brown bears and product fertile offspring.\n \nEvolutionists believe that the genetic (hereditary) information (which supplies the 'recipe' to construct such specialized features in the developing embryo) all arose by an accumulation of copying errors (mutations). Any 'good' errors which helped the creature to survive were passed on. In this way, they believe that these design features are all the result of these copying mistakes, accumulated by selection over millions of years.\n\n Not very well expressed. Genetic variability can be increased by mutation, recombination, and gene flow. And yes, it will accumulate over long periods of time, especially in large populations.\n \nCreationists, however, while accepting that all of today's bears probably descended from a single bear kind, do not believe that the information in the 'recipes' for all these design features arose by chance. No-one has ever observed any biological process adding information!\n\n So all bears came about by means of macroevolution so that new kinds of bears evolved in only a few years? Why is it that creationists always claim evolution at rates enough to make any evolutionary biologist's head spin, and then deny evolution?\n \nA better explanation is that virtually all the necessary information was already there in the genetic makeup of the first bears, a population created by God with vast genetic potential for variation.\n\n Not enough genetic space in the genome of two bears. You're going to have to show how enough genetic variation can be present in only two bears. By the way, your example where you claim so much variation from a single gene (25% TT, 50% Tt, 25% tt). Now you've got to explain where T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, T11, T12, T13, T14, and so on. There are lots of genes where there are more than a mere 2 alleles. That's just not enough variation.\n \nIn this, the bear kind has \"diversified\" through time to all the species that we see today.\n\n Right. And the question is where all of the diversity that we see came from. It would take a fool to claim that it was all present in a single pair.\n \nCertain species would have taken different parts of the original genome with them as they adapted to their individual environments (through natural selecion).\n\n But there was only the possibility of 4 alleles for any gene. Not enough variability to produce everything that we see today.\n \nThis doesn't mean that all of the features of today's bears would have been on obvious display back then.\n\n Actually, it does. Learn what you are talking about.\n \nA simple example would be the way in which mongrel dogs obviously had the potential to develop all the different breeds we see today.\n\n No they didn't. What was involved was mutation to produce the sports that were valued by the breeders. Learn what you are talking about.\n \nThus, there was no actual poodle to be seen among mongrel dogs hundreds of years ago, but by looking closely at many of them, one would have seen at least some of the individual features found in today's poodles popping up here and there.\n\n Poodles are one of the oldest breeds. They have existed for hundreds of years. And poodles have genetic characteristics that don't exist in wolves - it's one of the unusual things about poodles and it genetic.\n \nFor more information on this interesting topic of the diversity of bears, I would invite you to check out:\n\n Well that explains the ignorance of your statements. You're an AIG dupe. I only read AIG for the laughs. Right now you are providing them.\n \nThe same kind of thing can be shown for the birds that you mentioned, just variation within a kind through mutations and natural selection, i.e. information loosing processes.\n\n Define information. Again, you are claiming that an increase of genetic diversity is a loss of information. Before you claimed that a decrease is a loss of information. Why don't you stop being a parrot. You seem to have learned a few buzz words - like \"information\" - and use them as if you actually knew what you were talking about.\n \nCreation has, like evolution, made many predictions that is based on the Bible.\n\n Sure. Flat earth. Earth the center of the universe, fixed and unmoving, and others. One thing that the Bible didn't predict was scientific reality.\n \nSuch predictions include rapid variation within a kind,\n\n I'll ask again. Show why this is predicted from the Bible.\n \nthe mass extinction of species through the flood,\n\n Really? But the problem is where is there any evidence that there ever was a flood. Please tell me about the world wide geologic stratum that marks the beginning of the flood. That is also predicted by the Bible. Please tell me about the world wide geologic stratum that marks the end of the flood. Yet another prediction from the Bible. And finally, please tell me about some world wide stratum that marks a period during the flood. Yet another prediction from the Bible.\n \nand through the following ice age.\n\n Please show where the ice age was predicted in the Bible. That is going to be tough since the ice ages essentially ended before the mythical flood.\n \nWe would expect to see millions of dead things laid down by sedimetary rock in the fossil record -- and that is what we see.\n\n But we know what the aftermath of floods look like. There would be no place on earth where extremely fine layers of silt could have been deposited by the millions. We would no be able to observe millions of alternating layers of seasonal deposits, some of which we still see going on today. We would see all kinds of dead animals mixed together. If there was a flood, then the various geologic eras wouldn't exist.\n \nWe see fossils where there are animals that are still in the middle of giving birth, eating food -- probably from Noah's flood.\n\n What does that have to do with Noah's flood? \"probably\" just doesn't cut it - but it is good enough for \"creation science\"\n \nWe would also expect that there is no observed SNRs (Super Nova Remenants) in the third stage - and that is what we get - although talkorigins.com totally screws up the scientific evidence - they totally change it to suit their own story. They have no references and the article was not even written by a Ph.D. scientist - unlike the Answers in Genesis article.\n\n I see. So you are a PhD scientist in astronomy? That was a nice assertion though. I notice that you didn't support it by explaining why. Why don't you start a thread and tell us about it. I know a planetary physicist that I might convince to comment on your learned remarks.\n \nThe supposed transitional form called Archaeopteryx is not a transitional fossil. For one, it has fully formed flying feathers (including asymmetric vanes and ventral, reinforcing furrows as in modern flying birds), the classical elliptical wings of moder woodland birds and a large wishbone for attachment of muscles responsible for the downstroke of the wings (Science 259(5096):790-793, February 5, 1993).\n\n Why do any of those things mean that it isn't a transitional?\n \nIf you know anything about birds, than you would know that \"asymmetric vanes\" mean that the bird is a very powerful flyer.\n\n Nope. It means that it probably could fly. But most opinions are that it was not a \"powerful flyer.\" You haven't learned enough to know why, have you.\n \n In fact, you don't even know what a transitional is, do you?\n \nThis is very powerful evidence to suggest that the wings are not transitional.\n\n Then how do you explain the claws on the wings? And those claws resemble the claws of a theropod dinosaur, since birds don't have them.\n \nAlan Feduccia, a world authority on birds at the university of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an evolutionist himself, disagrees with the scientists who claim that Archaeopteryx is a transitional form says: \"Paleontologiss have tried to turn Archaeopteryx into an earth-bound, feathered dinosaur. But it's not. It is a bird, a pearching bird. And no amount of \"paleobabble\" is going to change that.\" (Cited in V. Morell, \"Archaeopteryx: Early bird catches a can of worms,\" Science 259(5059):764-65, February 5, 1993).\n\n Wouldn't it be nice if a creationist actually took the time to educate himself before speaking. Alan Feduccia does not doubt that Archaeopteryx is a transitional form. Dr. Feduccia believes that Archaeopteryx is transitional between an earlier archosaur and modern birds. The archosaurs were also the ancestors of the dinosaurs. The prevailing theory is that birds arose from theropods (maniraptors to be more exact) and that is what Dr Feduccia disagrees with. He does not deny that Archaeopteryx is transitional. In other words, you have been duped again. Get your facts straight before you speak.\n \nI would also invite you to look at the following site about the fossil record and the fossils that are in it:\n\n Not tonight. My sides already hurt from laughing at your argument from assertion.",

   "No. I didn't argue anything. I was explaining the meanings of the words as used by evolutionary biologists. Many creationists seem confused. They don't seem to be able to distinguish the definition of a process from the observations of the process from the theories that explain the process. It seems that you still share that confusion.\n\n \n I see that now... I'll be sure to read your posts a little more carefully. It seemed to me you were arguing that we have observed change in allele frequency, the theory of evolution explains how this change relates to the ancestry of animals, thus this theory has a great deal of credence or is \"proved\" beyond reasonable doubt. \n \n My response to that perceived arguement was that increase in complexity or information was not necessarily observed. We know that there must have been \"progressive\" evolution since there are complex creatures such as ourselves. So the \"microevolution\" doesn't prove \"progressive\" evolution. However, you did not make that arguement.\n \n I am aware of the distinctions you were speaking of.\n \n \n Define information as applicable to biological organisms. You need to define your terms and then show that you are correct. You are arguing from assertion. It is implicit in your points that you believe that information cannot increase. Show me why I should not reject everything you say out of hand because it is so vague. What about cases of microevolution that are an increase in information? What about those that are neither an increase or a decrease? \n\n \n I made a mistake in my definition of \"microevolution\", I should have said that it is change in allele frequency, but not necessarily increase in information -- which I defined as \"progressive\" evolution. I do not necessarily beleive that information cannot increase, my point was that common examples of \"microevolution\" do not show increase of information, so far as I know. Defining \"information\"... I will have to refer you to Dembski's definition. Basically, information is complex and it is specified. A complex entity could consist of Shakespeare or gibberish. Shakespeare contains information because of the meaning it has to people who understand English. DNA has information because of the meaning it has to the cell. Information, according to Dembski, is the elimination of possibilities. The information that Joe lives on Earth tells us that there is an entity refered to as Joe, as opposed to any other reference, who is not nonexistent, and does not live in any place but earth. The information that Joe lives on earth is not very informative, given that we know of no other place for a person to live and that the fact that Joe is reffered to as Joe means that he must exist. The information that Joe jumps on Mars would be comparatively very informing. \n \n I beleive the measure given at one point by Dembski is a halving of uncertainty being one unit. (although this is not in the essay I link to, replaced by probablilistic measurement) The statement \"Joe\" tells us that there is an entity rather than not (one half less uncertainty) that \"he\"(another halving?) is not reffered to by any other reference... which I suppose should be considered probabalisticly: the reference \"Joe\", given a male entity, may belong to 1000 out of a million males. Thus our uncertaity on this part is reduced by a large percentage. According to previous information that entities with male names (which are also known by previous information) are human males, we assume that the entity \"Joe\" is a guy who lives on earth. Thus the information that Joe \"lives on Earth\" gives us no real information(a very slight probablity of his living elsewhere is removed). If we are told he is on mars, not only are we given a very high degree of information, our future calculation of information is changed because we now know of a case of someone living away from Earth.\n \n I think it follows that there can be no information without specification, no meaning to Shakespeare without English, no meaning to \"Joe lives\" without a concept of the state of living and its alternatives. Conversely, there can be no specification without information. It follows, then, that information must either exist eternally, or not exist at all - that it could not have arisen by chance.\n \n At this point of my attempt to paraphrase Dembski, it is useful to ask how this applies to Biology, and how it might be tested. It seems that Dembski has done no calculation on the information content of a specific gene -- although I read of others who had applied his equation to a gene in an excellent critical review. And it is a good question as to how it could be tested. Dembski makes the claim that information is conserved -- new information cannot be created, except by intelligent choice. This claim can be tested, as the mentioned review claims to do: http://home.wxs.nl/~gkorthof/kortho44.htm\n \n I am having trouble directly correlating the above definition of information to specific examples of \"microevolution\", or thinking of a framework to interpret a particular DNA sequence and how much information it conveys. Nor can I see how an extremely specific peice of information is more 'useful' or 'well designed' or 'progressive' than a comparativly simple one. (the \"Beauty Principal\" comes to mind -- the best scientific theories are simple and elegant)\n \n Dembski's essay: http://www.arn.org/docs/dembski/wd_idtheory.htm \n \n \n So what? You seem to be defining information as genetic diversity. Since Chihuahuas and Great Danes are the result of artificial selection that reduced the genetic diversity you claim that this is a loss of information. OK. I'll accept that. In fact, there are several processes of natural evolution that tend to reduce the genetic diversity of populations. Here's three: natural selection, sexual selection, genetic drift. By the way, a change in allele frequency is not a loss of information since it isn't the loss of the allele (or as you incorrectly state, the gene). \n\n \n Good point, a change of allele frequency is not a loss of information. I guess my \"So what\" is that you need an increase in specified complex information or a progression to explain how we came from the hypothetical origional organism. (or \"progressive\" evolution)\n \n \n Nope. Macroevolution is observed. It is one of the observations that support the theory of evolution. No one is trying to \"prove\" macroevolution. So we can see in the case of artificial selection how it takes place, and we can see that corresponding events take place in natural populations, so we observe that evolution is taking place and then devise theories to explain the processes.\n \n Again, the observation that life has chanaged from simple organisms to more complex organisms over 3.8 billion years is one of perspective. Evolutionary theory does not include the concept of progress or increase of complexity. \n\n \n Once again it appears that I poorly described my point, which was that, while we have observed Macroevolution (or \"proved\" it) what we have seen is the result of a loss of information, which does not bolster the theory of evolution any more than observed Microevolution or evolution does. (and perhaps less so)\n \n Perhaps the point of Dembski, or the ultimate result of his work, is that the theory of evolution will seek to explain the increase of information.\n \n \n Actually, it looks like you were in over your head at point one - since none of them were points. \n\n \n Perhaps so. \n \n \n Right. And you have probably heard Gould's answer to your paraphrase many times too. Just in case, here it is...\n \n So which is your reason for taking Gould's quote out of context?\n\n \n I was not aware of Gould's annoyance, I wouldn't have quoted him. ... it had seemed to me that it was simply an honest acknowledgement of a problem with the traditional theory of evolution. Call me gullible, I really shouldn't have beleived that so readily. The topic is much too polarized.\n \n \n I don't know. Why do you think that scientists are dogmatic about gravity. Maybe it is possible that the moon is being pulled around the earth by invisible fairies. And of course, we shouldn't be dogmatic about the germ theory of disease. Maybe it is evil spirits that cause the cold, or chickenpox and the like. \n\n \n I wonder what your scientific basis for those theories are, and if they could be tested.\n \n \nYeah. The battle against the evils of evolution makes strange bedfellows, doesn't it? But the bulk of the IDers are religiously motivated. And none are basing anything on science.\n \n So anyone who calls himself a scientist should be able to present his particular bit of superstition in science classes across the country. what a good idea. Don't you think it would be a good idea that there be a scientific basis to these disagreements?\n\n \n As Gert Korthof, webmaster of a site dedicated to neutral reveiw of alternate theories of evolution and creationists, says, the validity of a particluar person's theory is not dependent on their beleifs, or even motivation. You conceed that not all intellegent designers are religous, yet claim that none of them base their objections on science. I wonder just what those people are basing their objections on.\n \n I thouroughly agree that there should be a scientific basis to the alternate theories or criticisms. (we are talking about science class aren't we?) For example, Michel Behe's theory of irreducible complexity -- that if a structure requires all of its parts to function it could not have evolved stepwise (which Darwin also mentioned) -- is not religious or philosophical. It is testable, it is arguable, he is highly competent in microbiology, it stimulates scientific inquiry. In fact, Behe says that one of his goals is to stimulate research in a neglected area. (Behe's statment, a response to critics: http://www.arn.org/docs/behe/mb_toresp.htm )\n \n That's why I say it does a disservice to scientific enquiry to present the theory of evolution as inerrant. It stifles thought and criticism, which results in a weaker or wrong theory supported by dogma.\n \n Korthof's critisism of Behe: http://home.wxs.nl/~gkorthof/korthof8.htm",

   "Can an allele with a former frequency of 0 end up with a frequency above 0 i under this definition?\n\n Now you're catching on. The answer is that of course it can. We have been talking about genetic diversity in a population and where it comes from. I have mentioned it several times. We know that mutation can produce new alleles because - yes, here it is again - we have observed it. How about that? The first observation of a black peppered moth was in 1848. 50 years later almost all peppered moths in industrialized areas were black. Now this isn't all that remarkable since the black allele is dominant. I think it was astronomyfan who tried to show a cross in the case of a non-dominant gene with two alleles. He thinks that 3 phenotypes are enough to explain all of the diversity that we see. In the moths, it is worse for creationism. Lets say that the allele B causes black moths and that it is dominent. Thus, bb is a peppered moth. Now a single mutation inherited in a single gamete forms the allele B on one moth. It's genotype is Bb, and since the allele is dominent, it is black. Thus, any moth that inherits even one B allele is black (BB and Bb), while only the bb are white. It's easy to see how this allele could have spread so quickly throught the population, especially if it offered a survival advantage, and it has been confirmed by several studies over more than 40 years that this is the case. From about 1850 on, black moths demonstrated a differential reproductive advantage in industrialized areas. Imagine that. The b allele survived because it is recessive and because it offered an advantage away from the industrialized areas.\n \n Now with the cleanup of the polution, the population has returned to white, or almost so. I believe that the current number is about 98% are observed to be white. These white moths are, of course, of the genotype bb. The black moths are BB (probably quite rare) or Bb.\n \nAs far as I can tell you need to assume this if you want to say that humans have fish and bacteria for ancestors.\n\n You creationists always state things in such a silly way. There are several lines of evidence that indicate that all life has a common origin. But humans share a common ancestor with the great apes, most recently with the chimps and bonobos. And we have the fossil record of many transitional forms between that ancestral population and modern humans.\n \n Nevertheless, that new alleles can and do arise isn't an assumption. It is an observation. Maybe at one time it was a prediction of evolutionary theory, but it has been observed.",

I'll take another shot if you would prefer not to read Dembski's paper.\n\n Well, I'm not going to buy Dempski's book. I have read enough about it and seen his arguments in other places and seen enough answers to know that I don't buy what he is saying. Essentially he is defining information such that it cannot increase.\n \nAre you saying its a straw man to say that there must be a mechanism for an increase in complexity/information? Just because \"progressive\" is a different name doesn't mean its a strawman.\n\n Yes it does. There is no notion of progress in evolutionary theory. That is a requirement of creationists. If you see progress then it is an accident of perspective. Organisms evolve in all directions. Something does not have to make \"progress\" to evolve. And now you are mixing \"progress\" with complexity and complexity with information. Are humans more complex than algae? In many ways we are. Are we more complex that a monkey? Nope. We are different.\n \nInformation: \"decrease in uncertainty\" is Dembski's defenition. How could this apply to biology, would be the question. As I said, I can't really think of a way....\n\n I agree with you there. I can't either. I think that that definition comes from Shannon. Shannon was concerned with communication. His paper is on line somewhere. It is linked from Information Theory and Creationism. You might like to review that site. The authors talk about Shannon information, classical information, Gitt information, Dempski information, and Spetner information.\n \n So here are some of my thoughts on information. Shannon envisioned a communication system as an information source, a transmitter, channel, receiver, and destination. The encoding of the information to the transmitter made the message which was transmitted across the channel to the receiver which was then decoded by the destination. In shannon's scenario, communication, any change in the message was a decrease in information. In that scenario, it is true that between the transmitter and the receiver there can be no increase in information. But that's not biology.\n \n But we can draw a definition from Shannon. We can define information as the number of bits required to represent the message. If we apply that to the genome, then information is the number of bits required to describe the genome - all of it. Now, if a single point mutation occurs that creates an allele that didn't exist before, then the number of bits required to describe the genome has increased.\n \n So even a simple mutation is can be an increase in information. What if an entire gene is duplicated? Nothing new there. Now what if one of those genes mutates to form a new protein. Isn't that an increase in information?\n \n It has been observed.\n \nInteresting note about the peppered moth. I always thought that there were origionally very few black ones, and they become more common over time, and then swung back. I think it would make sense to say that the introduction of a new color to a species qualifies as an increase of information.\n\n Here's even more information on moths. The peppered moth (Biston betularia) was the moth studied by Kettlewell. A very similar mutation has been observed in other moths as well, with the same effect, it produces a dominant allele that results in a dark morph.\n \nAnd, just to repeat my point, scientific arguements against evolution shoud not be ignored.\n\n They aren't ignored. Darwin's theories were hotly debated in the last half of the 19th century. When Mendel's genetics were rediscovered, they were at first interpreted as falsification of Darwin's theories. It wasn't until the 1930s that it was recognized that genetics were recognized as the mechanism of heredity that Darwin predicted.\n \n There's a lot of debate going on in evolutionary biology. But none of it is centered on whether evolution happens and whether it is the explanation for the observations of the fossil record, the nested phylogeny of living things, and so on. Just as physicists don't debate whether gravity exists, they don't argue about the major theories of evolution. Now if you had some valid argument that should be presented, then you would be famous. The thing is, creationists don't like the theory, not because they have valid alternatives but because they can't reconcile their mythology.\n \nAre there any laws against teaching an arguement that critisices evolution?\n\n Nope. If you know of any that should be taught in a high school class, then speak up. Generally, any good biology teacher will do that as time permits. But fairy tales do not make science. Only science, pro or con to any theory, should be presented in science class. Thus, creationism can't be presented in science classes.\n \nIf not, I don't really see a problem with the way things are.\n\n Great! Now what do we do about the creationists who want to impose their religion on everyone by law? I guess they haven't read the 1st Amendment.",

   "Interesting note about the peppered moth. I always thought that there were origionally very few black ones, and they become more common over time, and then swung back.\n\n Correct. As coal dust became prevalent, so did the dark morph. Then as the envirnoment cleaned up again, the dark morph faded back into the minority.\n \n \nI think it would make sense to say that the introduction of a new color to a species qualifies as an increase of information. \n\n In the case of the moth, it was more of a redistribution of prevalence. Now, the nylon-eating bacteria clearly do represent a new information, as there was no nylon 100 years ago, and there now are bacteria eating exclusively nylon.\n \n \nAnd, just to repeat my point, scientific arguements against evolution shoud not be ignored.\n\n Correct. The problem is, of course, that such scientific arguments really don't exist. There are arguments about some of the specific mechanisms, but not against evolution itself.\n \n \nAre there any laws against teaching an arguement that critisices evolution? If not, I don't really see a problem with the way things are.\n\n \n \n That is, as long as what is taught in science class remains science and not dogma dressed up as pseudo-science.",

   "I think science should be taught. I think the best approach is to teach kids about genes, observed microevolution - dogs are a good example and also teach them things like E = mc^2 and how time distorts and your mass increases as you increase velocity. Throw away statements \"that we came from slime\" or we \"came from the big bang\" sounds dodgy to some students and they doubt it because there is no simple direct evidence for it. Then you end up with students saying things like \"Those science nerds think they know everything but they are full of mumbojumbo\". I have seen it happen.\n\n \n so you want to teach about how dogs evolved from wolves, but then thats it? Wouldn't it be logical to assume that perhaps the fox, jackel and coyote have a place in there too? Waht about cats? should schools teach about them too? but i assume, only that the different breeds of cats microevolved from some nondescript cat once upon a time? are not lions and tigers and leopards related in here somewhere? or are you just creating your own personal imaginary cut off point?\n \n Schools don't teach that we 'come from slime'. while there may be a theory that follows that logic, it IS just a theory. Evolution is taught because it is descent with modification, or changes in allele freqencies over time. One can see this is the wolf to dog evolution. We have a wonderful fossil record that backs this up. Now should we selectively ignore this because it makes a few people uncomfortable? Science is taught because it follows a method and seeks to answer questions about the natural world. now fundies would like this to be scrapped and have creationism taught in school. creationism can be taught in church, where i learned it. \n \n now suppose we removed evolution, which creation story should we put in its place? christan? hindu? native american? everyones got their own story.",

I am sorry to burst your bubble, but one can go outside and see evidence for evolution in everything. Creation is a story based on faith, of which is not provable. thats why campfire bible stories will never be taught in school. Evolution is taught in school, because its what he have evidence for, what we can test, and what we see everyday. School teaches us about the natural world. I took biology and environmental science, and how the earth formed was FUNDAMENTAL to this. Plate tectonics, the formation of islands via volcanoes, formation of mountain ranges (think mt everst)..life has evolved from simple to complex. No biology couse would be complete without this. AS for coming from slime, i cannot say for sure that is EXACTLY how it happened, that is it is a theory. In school, we teach children to become critical thinkers, to engage them and have them question why things are the way they are. Thus we expose them to all current thinking of the time, they are always free to believe what their heart tells them.\n \n And why not teach the theory that we evolved from single celled ancestors? all evidence points to life orginating in that way (whether or not through divine intervention, thats your own call). Life a we know it follows clear rules, we can trace evolution very well in the vertebrates. the movement of the pelvic bones, middle ear bones. Our own cells contain mitochrondria, which contains its own DNA more simular to bacteria (endosymbiosis). Ever stdy slime molds? facinating how they go from single celled to complex aggregations for reproduction. My education would be completely lacking if i had never had this taught to me.

I can model it with Markov chains and use it to prove the requirement of infinite population for the Hardy weinberg law and I challenge you to do the same. \n 4)natural selection- Genes that reduce you chance of getting to mate do not get passed so in a single generation there is less diversity. \n 5)non-random mating-The same as natural selection for this argument\n 6)gene flow- new species migrate from elsewhere so I would say increase in diversiy\n \n As for the founder effect and the Amish, there were only a few Amish immigrants that migrated initially and they kept to themselves so they had an initial lack of genetic diversity. \n \n As for the peacocks tail I it is something I have thought of often and I used it to come up with my own theory. Consider the Blue whale. In many ways we have more intelligence and a more advanced language than them due to our different brains. However the blue whale never evolved some of our mental abilities even though with its massive size a bigger brain is not such a liability. We evolved a bigger brain even though with our smaller size it takes more of our daily energy intake to run. Now the fact we have hands and opposable thumbs makes our advanced intelligence worthwhile but what about speech? Could there be a peacock tail effect? If our ancestors prefered sexual partners with above average speech centres couldn't our speech centre grow just like the peacocks tail? Under my theory it was a happy coincidence that it kept growing until we got to the stage that we could explain things to our young. If you like this sort of discussion I would recommend Richard Dawkins books. \n \n \n \n As for your question about baldness it seems a bit tedious \n If your wifes father is not bald and none of the wife siblings are bald\n then I would lean towards the assumption that the father in law is XBYb\n and the mother in law is XbXb. However if the wife only has sisters then a possibility is father in law could be XbYB and the probability of a sister being bald is zero. Another possibility is the father in law is XBYb and the mother in law is XBXb because you could have sisters XbXB and brothers XbYb. Am I supposed to assign aribitary possibilities p, q and 1- p - q to each of the three possibilites. As for a man with that is bald who father is not bald then you the Father is XbYb and the existance of a non bald brother would mean the mother would have to be XBXb but again you said sibling and not brother so I would have to assign probabilities t and 1-t the XbYbXBXb and XbYbXBXB",

All the genes have the same chance of going into to the next generation so obviously p is fixed. But if you want the sort of argument that would convince everyone here it is. \n Note: that if a 2 follows something it means squared \n so p2 = p squared and p3 = p cubed. \n \n Now in the initial generation if the allele frequency of A is p then \n P(AA) = p2\n P(aA) = 2p(1-p) = 2p-2p2\n P(aa)= (1-p)2 = 1 - 2p +p2\n \n So in the next generation\n P(AA) = P( parents AAAA) + 1/2 P(parents AaAA)+1/2P(parents(AAAa)+ 1/4 P(parents(AaAa))\n =p4 + 2p3-2p4+ p2-2p3 +p4\n =p2.\n \n \n I swear on my own eyes that I fully understand the maths of what is going on here.\n \n edit: my wording sucks and I admit it and I won't change it.

White beans (beans should be the same size and shape)\n \n Start with 10 white beans and 90 red ones in the bag.\n \n 1. draw them out without looking, 2 at a time.\n \n Talley each time as 2 reds, one red and one white, or two whites.\n \n 2. Then increase the whites by 10, decreasing the reds by the same number.\n \n 3. Repeat until you finish with 90 white and ten red.\n \n 4. Graph the number of WW, RW, and RR for each trial. The three lines will give you the classic Hardy-Weinberg curves. And the percentage of each in each trial will be close to that predicted by Hardy-Weinberg. If you use a larger sample, the result will be closer. All an infinite sample would do would be to guarantee exact agreement with Hardy-Weinberg.\n \n My 8th grade science class has no trouble with this concept, or the way it works in the real world.",

   "That question has me stumped Barbarian.\n \n I can only offer a guess. \n As I understand it the assumptions of Hardy Wienberg are\n Assumptions \n 1)large population - to insure no sampling error from one generation to the next \n 2)random mating - no assortive mating or mating by genotype \n 3)no mutations - or mutational equilbrium\n even new mutations have little effect on allele frequencies from one generation to the next \n 4)no migration between populations \n 5)no selection - all genotypes reproduce with equal success \n \n Since these assumptions are not true I assume the violated assumptions cancel each other out. A hypothetical scenario would be that gene A could mutate into gene B and gene B could mutate into gene A. This would ensure a mix of genes in a small populations.\n \n edit: a fancier version of my answer. \n If you had a population of 1000 and two genes A and B could be at a Locus. If you had the situatin that gene A mutates into gene B 10% of the time during reproduction and gene B mutates into gene A 90% of the time then the population will be attracted to the state where there allele frequency is 0.9. As long as mutation from 1 gene to another is fixed then there is a unique attractive state. The maths is good but I do not if the claim of constant mutation rate is reasonable. If it is true the system will move towards a unique stationary(unchanging state) state exponentially fast. This is using the theory of Markov chains. I find it quite interesting and I encourage you read up on it if you understand eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n \n further edit: my can be extended to the case were they are alleles A,B,C as long as any allele can mutate into the other in a finite number of steps and the mutation rate is fixed.",

At least some of the time, for many alleles, the assumptions are close enough to make a very good prediction of genotypes in the next generation. Think of a market economy. One of the assumptions of a market economy is that no player in the system is big enough to noticably effect the system on his own. Obviously, that's not the case in most modern economies, where very large corporations, unions, etc. do take actions that are noticable. Yet economists are still able to use the theory to make accurate predictions, even if they have to recognize that there might be some exceptions.\n \n \nSince these assumptions are not true I assume the violated assumptions cancel each other out. A hypothetical scenario would be that gene A could mutate into gene B and gene B could mutate into gene A. This would ensure a mix of genes in a small populations.\n\n \n That's possible, but very unlikely. Too many lucky hits to switch back and forth. Just the law of large numbers working.\n \n \nedit: a fancier version of my answer. \n If you had a population of 1000 and two genes A and B could be at a Locus.

I find it quite interesting and I encourage you read up on it if you understand eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n\n \n That would work, but few alleles are such that a single mutation would reliably switch one to another. If you'd like to do an experiment with bags of differing numbers of white and red beans, you can do the pure Hardy-Weinberg simulation. To relax the assumptions on isolation, you can randomly drop in and remove a randomly-determined number of red and white beans. To simulate assortive mating, you could put in a rule by rolling dice to see whether or not a particular mating worked. Unless the assortive mating or emigration and immigration is very pronounced, you will get the same three curves, but with some noise.\n \n \nfurther edit: my can be extended to the case were they are alleles A,B,C as long as any allele can mutate into the other in a finite number of steps and the mutation rate is fixed.\n\n \n An ingenious solution, but real alleles probably never mutate back and forth in that manner.",

   "I think that the discussion so far has turned the Hardy-Weinberg law upside down. The \"assumptions\" are not assumptions of evolution, but of non-evolution. The point is that if all of the assumptions were true then there would be no evolution, and that may be true for any given heritary characteristic. However, if a population is observed to change, then you can be sure that at least one of the Hardy-Weinberg assumptions has been violated. A small population has become isolated, or large gaudy tails on males are apealing to females, or a mutation happens, or a previously isolated population is rejoined to the parent population, and of course, all genotypes do not reproduce with equal success.\n \n The point is that when evolution is observed to happen, the Hardy-Weinberg assumptions have been violated.",

   "I have a challenge that will take me a long time. \n \"alleles mutate into each other\" into google got one hit, since it was talking about canalization which seems to when things stay the same maybe my theory might actually happen in and nature \"forces\" the allele frequencies to be fixed and \"immune\" to genetic drift even with a small population under a very specific circumstances. I am probably wrong and most likely I will not gain a deep understanding but attempting to work it out would keep me off the streets. \n \n here is a quote from the article. \n This model is a simplified version of the ''modifier model''\n of genetic canalization studied by Wagner et al. (1997). I\n consider a quantitative trait X affected by eight additive\n ''structural'' loci and one modifier locus. There are two alleles,\n denoted by ''2'' and ''1'' at each of the structural\n loci. These alleles mutate into each other with a haploid\n genomic rate U. These mutations ensure maintenance of genetic\n variation at the structural loci.",
