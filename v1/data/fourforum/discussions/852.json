   "Depends on the Atheist.\n \n Some of a set of \"natural\" ethics or some such, based upon the least harm as possible to everyone.\n \n I myself have a three tiered code of morality in which the top level doesn't exist, the second layer has to be ignored, and the third layer is changed whenever needed.\n \n The first is universal morality, which imo doesn't exist, without all and every perception that ever has existed or ever will exist. We don't have that, hence we have no universal morality.\n \n The second is what I term societal morality, although it is possible to call it civilized morality, things needed for the civilization to work orderly. I.e. murder is wrong, stealing is wrong, etc. Also included are what the society considers wrong and right but it is not necessarily needed for the society to exist. I.e. men should not wear dresses.\n \n The third and most common to everyone, is personal morality. What you think is right and wrong. Often very much intertwined with societal morality, this morality determines what you think of the world. For example, a creationist might think evolution is bad. A biologist may think the opposite.

   "Hello again. emoticon_xbye \n \n Having been an atheist just a few years ago, I think I can answer that. A huge part of it is practical in nature. Simply put, if no one follows any moral codes whatsoever, the world would be absolutely unlivable. As long as most everyone is morally opposed to stealing, murder, etc, we can be reasonably safe walking down the street and not have to worry about being gunned down for our clothes or wallet or whatever. A complete indifference to the moral backing behind any law could easily undermine that law, create a domino effect, and result in anarchy. So people avoid the temptation to shoplift for the reward of living in relative safety. \n \n That's one reason. Maybe a bigger one is just that hurting other people simply doesn't sit right with most people, even if there is no spiritual incentive or religious commandment. If I was ever put in a situation where I could get a billion dollars tax free, and all I'd have to do was shoot some stranger in the head -- with an absolute guarantee that I'd never be caught and that society wouldn't crumble as in the scenario of the first paragraph -- I could never do that. As much as I'd love to have a billion dollars, the idea of murder is far too revolting to ever even consider it, even for a fraction of a second. Though I'm agnostic now, my spirituality isn't so developed yet to play a major role in that decision. Besides, I would've made the same decision a few years ago, even without any threat of hell or desire to follow Scripture. It's just wrong.\n \n I guess a good way to try to understand it is to put yourself in the same mindframe. If you suddenly found out today, without a shred of doubt, that God doesn't exist, there's no afterlife, yadda yadda -- it's absolutely proven, the whole shebang is just a fairy tale. Would the only thing stopping you from murdering or stealing be the threat of legal consequences?\n \n Interestingly, this is where you find a lot of variance between religious morality and social morality. Since certain moral codes are only spelled out in the Bible, and are not practically or socially based, you find that only religious people are compelled to follow them. Taking the Lord's name in vain is a great example. And -- I'm sure you saw this one coming -- homosexuality is another one.\n \n Hope that answered it. I notice that I focused mostly on \"morality\" while you specifically asked about \"fair and unfair,\" but that's because to an atheist the two are more or less interchangable. Since, in the atheist's view, there's no other influence on morality, he defines it based only on what he considers to be fair or unfair. And that, like I said, is based on practicality and what seems to be a natural understanding of right and wrong. I don't know, maybe we're taught it, or maybe it's more an inborn gut feeling. That's the beauty of agnosticism: there's never a satisfactory genesis for anything. ;)",

   "How does an atheist discern what is fair or unfair?\n\n \n Hmmm, have you ever thought about what you would consider to be fair or unfair if you found out God didn't exist? I'm guessing not much would change in what you thought was morally correct. What is fair and unfair is not going to simply be determined by religion. It is probably as determined by a society the person lives in as anything else. For instance, I do think it is fair to treat blacks and whites differently? Had I lived 50 or 100 years ago in the US, I probably would have said yes. Even the religious may have agreed. However today, both religious and myself say no, it is not fair to treat them differently. So religion alone doesn't determine what is fair and unfair.\n \n Give me an example of something that needs religion to discern between what is fair and unfair and I'm pretty sure common sense will dictate what the answer to that is. That is except the subject of abortion which I believe the religious people don't even try to make proper sense out of.",

   "Here's a hastily put together attempt at the point I am trying to make. \n \n I believe Crim stated, \"We know life isn't fair.\" Exactly right, we know. Only WE know. ONLY we as HUMANS know. We know. No other being on the planet KNOWS fair and unfair.\n \n It can be seen from our interaction on this thread and also gleaned from our own personal experiences in life that most everyone has a sense of fairness. This \"sense\" is present in the very young to the very old, male and female, black, white, Asian, and Hispanic, atheist, Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, educated, uneducated etc. It may be asserted by an individual, an organization, a corporation, or even a country. It can even be reasonably surmised that this sense of fairness is present across cultures and civilizations (the aborigine on a deserted island question). \n \n Now I do not say that there is a consensus on what is fair and unfair. I simply state that everyone makes a judgment on fairness and unfairness. This is a fact. This was demonstrated on the thread when you answered whether the situations I presented were fair or unfair. I'm sure it has also happened in your life at some point that you said, \"That's not fair.\"\n \n In summary, we have established a few things with the postings thus far. Atheists can and do make judgments on what is fair or unfair. Atheists also seemingly must subscribe to materialistic evolution to maintain their atheistic views because it is the most reasonable, empirically proven theory, absent a god. Nothing outside the material order is allowed consideration in the mind of a true atheist.\n \n I propose to you that this sense of fairness is the very thing that refutes one's atheism. For if one is confined by the spectacles of atheistic materialistic evolution then there is no room for fairness or unfairness. Only when one takes off these glasses can he see the abstract wonder of fair and unfair. \n \n As an organism  we cannot disobey the laws of the material order any more than a lower animal can. As an organism, one will surely fall if he attempts to defy the law of gravity. He cannot defy heredity or biochemistry. The laws of arithmetic unequivocally state that 2+2=4. But, as a human we can  disobey our sense of doing what is fair. This is a law that we do not share with animals, plants, or inorganic matter. So this is not purely a material law though it is naturally inherent in us all. It is a \"supermaterial\" law. It is both natural and supernatural. It can never be confined by the physicality of man though it is found in the being of man.\n \n Now, Crim mentioned that fair was a level playing field. When he attempted to describe why he deserved a level playing field he stated, \"I believe a level playing field is the best for all involved. Empathy and understanding show us that this is what people want, and simple observation shows that it works.\" Empathy/understanding-these things are nonexistent in a pure materialism. He states that empathy and understanding is what people want but he cannot explain why people want this. From where does this want generate? The truth is, from an atheistic belief, no one does deserve a level playing field. You have what you have been selected to have by the environment but this is not an equal opportunity planet. The Lion is the King of the Jungle because natural selection/genetics has made him thus. None of the other animals say this is not fair, they just fight and struggle and use what has been selected for them to stay alive. Survival of the fittest reigns supreme in this realm.\n \n Crim and I have also talked about suffering. He told me that he opposes suffering but he never fully explained why he opposed it. He stated that suffering must necessarily be negative to qualify as suffering. But negative in the atheistic sense means that you lose your kill, you lose an appendage, you lose your life. It is a material loss. Negative in our world of humanity means the same with a little extra-offense, shock, distaste, horror, mourning-fairness or unfairness. We would not oppose suffering if we were the result of simple material interaction that formed a sum greater than the parts. We would just go about our business at hand and step over the dead person lying in the street. We would continue our quest for self-preservation or in the noblest scenario we would attempt tribal/pack/herd preservation. There is no suffering in the animal kingdom. Not from an animal viewpoint at least. Suffering is only seen as suffering by humans. But how do we see it if we are simply elevated animals in the material order of evolution? How do we see outside of the material universe into the realm of suffering? How do we step outside of the predator and prey relationship? \n (Not trying to pick on Crim, we have just interacted on this subject a bit in the past).\n \n Goturge mentioned revenge. There is also no room for revenge in a materialistic, atheistic view. An animal does not commit revenge. He attacks for food, for dominance, to avoid being attacked, to defend his life, etc. \n \n I told Lurch on another thread that there was no room for opinions in science. He took that statement at face value and debated it down, readily proving that there is opinion in the realm of science. I was not trying to deny the presence of opinion but I was attempting to illustrate that opinion constrained within the scientific rules of evolution is not opinion at all. Within the strict limitations of materialism opinion is merely random fate, natural selection, mutation, chemical reaction... How can one look at atheistic evolution from the outside? You must be inside evolution. You must be a product of evolution yourself. How does one look on evolution and form an opinion without being subject to evolution? Evolution does not apply-- subsequently allowing the spontaneity, originality, and uniqueness of human opinion. Or atheistic evolution contains all, including man, and one's environment and instinct dictate opinion and extinguish free will. (Poet, this ties in with the irrational/rational debate we had also on another thread).\n \n This line of reasoning is actually not my own. It is an adaptation of what C.S. Lewis put forth in Chapter One of Mere Christianity. Lewis was an atheist who became a Christian. I do not cite his conversion as a validation of anything I have proposed above because I am sure that you can cite many theists who have become atheists (sometimes yourselves). I rather reveal his atheism because it tells you that, having been an atheist, he has experienced some of the same thoughts and experiences you have. He did not have the same perspective as I do being a believer from my childhood.\n \n I am not challenging evolution. I am challenging atheism and subsequently atheistic evolution. I do believe in the possibility of a theistic evolution. My attack is not on scientific proofs of evolution. It is on evolution as an isolated theory absent of some type of rational, creative input.\n \n Let me know what you guys think. \n Peace.",

If we were in a pure materialist world exercising a purely atheistic materialist view then we could never put blame on anyone for anything. Lewis makes the point that we could no more blame the Nazis for the wrongs they committed than we could blame them for the color of their hair. \n \n He goes on further that people say that different civilizations and different ages have demonstrated very different moralities. They discount the idea of a universal right and wrong/a law of decent behavior because of these differences. But if one examines history, the differences have not been a total difference. The moral teachings of the major cultures of history have been similar to each other and our own current teachings. The presence of a totally different morality between ages and civilizations would look something like this: men would be honored for running away in battle, a man might feel proud for double-crossing those closest to him, Scrooge would be a hero, Ghandi a villain...it would be like adding 2+2 to equal 5.\n \n Lewis makes the assertion that whenever you find someone who states that he doesn't believe in an objective right and wrong, you will find him going back on this an instant later. He will break a promise to you but when you break one to him he will cry that it is unfair. Have you ever complained of someone breaking a promise?\n \n As I said, there is no consensus on right and wrong. Lewis says that there is not total agreement because sometimes people can get math wrong even though it is true.

   "These things exist only in the human kingdom. \n \n \n They exist, but since no animal society has the complexity of ours, they're certainly not clear. Animals know when one of their own is being an XXX. If you ever watch a long primate documentary, there always ends up being one male who in his teenager-equivilent years acts like a jerk and beats up the apes younger than him. They don't have a prison to stick him in for assault and killing him is a little extreme, but he's not going to be getting any favors.

A 5-year old human? A child who is 5 doesn't have a good understanding of morality (and as such, they aren't punished by our justice system as an adult is). If you think of an animal's moral compass being similar to a little kid's, I think it comes out pretty accurately. They can work 'morally' on a reward-punishment system when a leader is in place (alpha male/matriarch or human parents) and they have basic empathetic feelings and recognition of harm, but they don't have a strong grasp of the consequences of their actions. \n \n I definitely wouldn't apply this standard to the animals with extremely low intelligence like insects and fish. One doesn't expect their pet mouse or turtle to do much, but cat and dog owners expect their pets not to bite strangers who walk through the door. \n \n In conclusion, humans' deeper understanding of morality is not due to any supernatural forces, but to a far superior intelligence to our animal brethren.",

Do you honestly believe that without God every man, woman, and child would instantly revert to caring only about their own pleasure? If so, that's just plain ignorant. \n \n Most atheists, whether they declare themselves to be humanists or not, go by the tenents of humanism and naturalism. If you're unfamiliar with the concepts they can be distilled as follows:\n \n \"A conviction that dogmas, ideologies and traditions, whether religious, political or social, must be weighed and tested by each individual and not simply accepted on faith.\"\n \n \"Commitment to the use of critical reason, factual evidence, and scientific methods of inquiry, rather than faith and mysticism, in seeking solutions to human problems and answers to important human questions.\" \n \n \"A primary concern with fulfillment, growth, and creativity for both the individual and humankind in general.\"\n \n \"A constant search for objective truth, with the understanding that new knowledge and experience constantly alter our imperfect perception of it.\"\n \n \"A concern for this life and a commitment to making it meaningful through better understanding of ourselves, our history, our intellectual and artistic achievements, and the outlooks of those who differ from us.\" \n \n \"A search for viable individual, social and political principles of ethical conduct, judging them on their ability to enhance human well-being and individual responsibility.\" \n \n \"A conviction that with reason, an open marketplace of ideas, good will, and tolerance, progress can be made in building a better world for ourselves and our children\"\n \n That's hardly hedonism.\n \n \nGod doesn't murder. Only people can murder. And at the other end of the spectrum, a dog can't murder you either. We have the ability to sin.\n\n \n Oh, I see. When God kills people for no apparant reason other than petty vengeance it's not murder. Got it. So the following are examples of what exactly? Compassion? Love? Tolerance?\n \n \"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and XXX.\" (I Samuel 15:2-3)\n \n \"Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD. Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.\" (Numbers 31:16-18)\n \n \"Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword. Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.\" (Isaiah 13:15-16)\n \n \"And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made the man.\" (Genesis 9:5-6)\n \n \"And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain.\" (Deuteronomy 2:34)\n \n \"And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Hesbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities we took for a prey to ourselves.\" (Deuteronomy 3:6-7)\n \n \"And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and woman: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.\" (Ezekiel 9:5-6)\n \n \"Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.\" (Revelation 7:3-4)\n \n \"And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.\" (Revelations 9:3-4)\n \n \"Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree: And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.\" (Deuteronomy 12:2-3)\n \n \"The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance. He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.\" (Psalms 58:10)\n \n Can't you just feel God's love?! *cough* I didn't even mention the flood, where God killed every living thing on the Earth except Noah and his collected animals. It's a good thing God can't commit murder or he'd be the biggest mass murderer in history.\n \n \nWhen Jesus says love your neighbour, that's what is moral; as far as Christianity is concerned. For a Christian, to not obey Christ's morals is not to establish your own relative morality... it is to disobey. Simple! It is to be immoral. \n\n \n Do you also blindy obey the following things that Jesus said? Are they moral as well?\n \n \"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.\" (Matthew, 10:34)\n \n \"For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.\" (Matthew, 10:35)\n \n \"And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.\" (Matthew, 10:36)\n \n \"The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.\" (Luke, 12:46)\n \n \"And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.\" (Luke, 12:47)\n \n I especially like those last two. Jesus is advocating the beating of slaves.\n \n \nAtheists enslaved people. On another post someone was arguing that the founding fathers of America were mostly atheists.\n\n \n Actually the majority of the founding fathers were Deists. Deism is the belief that the universe was created by God, but once his work was done he had nothing more to do with his creation. This country was definitely NOT founded on Christianity.\n \n \"...The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion...\" treaty with Tripoli, passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate and signed by president Adams on June 10, 1797\n \n \nI suppose you're going to tell me Stalin was a regular church-goer. I think he killed more than all the Crusades combined.\n\n \n According to Christianity, if Stalin accepted Jesus Christ as his personal lord and savior he'd go right up to heaven. On the other hand, if Mother Theresa had been an atheist, she'd be condemned to eternal hellfire. So obviously Christian morality has nothing to do with what people actually do. The only thing that matters is blind acceptance of Christianity.\n \n \nWhich verses of the Bible were favourites of Adolf Hitler?\n\n \n It would have been hard for him to pick a favorite since the bible is loaded with so many quotes that were right up his alley.\n \n \nWhen a Christian acts anti-Christian, he can be judged by the beliefs he follows. So when a Christian does evil, you can say \"That's very un-Christian of you\". However, when an atheist does something evil, do you say \"That's very un-Atheistic of you?\"\n\n \n Try \"inhumane.\" The Christian can just go ask for forgiveness from the Lord and his slate is wiped clean. Quite a convenient system for justifying atrocities.\n \n \nWhat reason do you have for putting down all religious people everywhere? For fun! Hedonism! Or, you're a bigot, so much for being free thinking and un-judgmental. You're exposed as a hypocrite!\n\n \n My reason is that ignorance, stupidity, narrow-mindedness, and intolerance must always be challenged. A spade should be called a spade.\n \n \nThat's a big call! Atheists are content? I suppose next you're going to say all the people at the NYSE are greedy Jews!\n\n \n No. I'm not going to say that. But if I did, it would be no more an ignorant generalization than claiming that all atheists are hedonists.\n But thanks for providing such a good illustration of your own bigotry.",

Fundamentalists and bible based denominations often hold the above view. Catholics do not hold the view that someone will go to hell simply if he is an atheist either. We believe that willful and persistent atheism after gaining knowledge of Christ can be sinful. But someone who has never been exposed to the gospel or who does not fully understand it will not be condemned to hell if he leads a moral life.\n \n \nTry \"inhumane.\" The Christian can just go ask for forgiveness from the Lord and his slate is wiped clean. Quite a convenient system for justifying atrocities.\n\n \n Another misconception.

He must be sorry for the sin, confess it, and  amend his way of life.\n \n Peace.",

Let's say you have two people... one of them is an atheist and one of them is a devout Christian. Both of them are very moral, kind, compassionate, and honest people. The Christian believes that if he acts that way throughout his life he'll be rewarded with an afterlife, and if he doesn't he'll be punished with eternal damnation. His actions are not an end in themselves, but serve a selfish ulterior motive. The atheist, on the other hand, has no such incentive. He simply acts that way out of the common sense belief that it's the most logical way to be, and the most conducive to a peaceful life. Who is the better person? I'll give you a hint... it's not the Christian.\n\n \n How have you judged that the atheist is \"better?\" What does \"better\" mean?",

Unsatisfied with just 10, they kept saying \"oh, sure, but what about in this situation, and this situation, and what about this...\"\n\n \n Okay, so if we only need 10 laws then they must be, without any doubt, the 10 most important rules possible that would serve mankind throughout history. Not coveting your neighbor's oxen made the list? Why is not creating any graven images more important than not enslaving people? That didn't even make the list. If those 10 things were all that God intended to impart on mankind I have to question his mental competance.\n \n \n \nSo you'd advocate a relationship with God that would go something like this...\n SO, I could wake up and say \"God, should I get out of bed now?\"\n \"YES\"\n \"God, should I go to the loo (toilet) now?\"\n \"YES\"\n \"God, should I wash my hands now?\"\n \"YES\"\n \"God, should I have breakfast now?\"\n \"NO\"\n \"Ok\" (for to disobey would be a sin) \"God, should I go back to bed now?\"\n \n BECAUSE that way, according to you I'd be 100% clear about what God wants.

So you're against laws or laws made by governments? Obviously if you are against a country, then you are being to a degree unpatriotic. \n\n \n Again, you're missing my point. I'm not against laws. I'm against manipulation. The concept of \"patriotism\" is most often used to suppress dissent. If someone starts asking too many questions you accuse them of being unpatriotic. The current administration used it brilliantly. After 9/11 the Democrats were so afraid of being labeled unpatriotic (and possibly losing votes) that they rolled over and let the Bush administration railroad things like the patriot act through congress mostly unopposed. In religion the concept of \"faith\" is used the same way, only instead of worrying about your chances for re-election you're worried about your chances for admittance to heaven. It suppresses dissent.\n \n \nNext, do you know any Christians that were born, raised, and died a Christian without ever asking a question about religion? Obviously then the forms of Christianity as practiced aren't able (or willing) to stop questioning and dissent... after-all it's you facing your Creator, not the Church.\n\n \n Of course Christians ask questions, but ultimately the promised reward and threatened punishment outweigh them. If you're talking about giving up eternal life and risking eternal hellfire most people will eventually choose to tow the line just in case, as evidenced by the increasing importance of religion in people's lives as they get closer to death.\n \n \nWhat have you got in favour of impure thoughts? Obviously if they're bad, you shouldn't be relishing them.\n\n \n Who gets to decide what's impure? I'm not in favor of thoughts about things that are harmful to other people. I'm even less in favor of anyone claiming that they should make those judgements for me. That's not to say I'm an anarchist who's against law. Democratically agreed upon laws are necessary for the healthy functioning of society.\n \n \nAs for masturbation, we are against all forms of self-abuse. (http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/selfabuse.htm). Perhaps you enjoy abusing yourself with drugs, or pain or whatever. But there are consequences of this, immediate ones, and eternal ones. If you don't respect your body, which is a living icon, then how could people respect you?\n\n \n Abusing myself? You're only proving my point. Please explain to me how doing something that gives myself pleasure and harms no one is abusing myself? We all have biological and instinctual sexual drives and desires. It's the ideal thing to make you feel guilty about because no one can avoid it, so convincing you that it's something you have to atone for through the church is brilliant. Look how well it works on you.\n \n \nTell me, if you're not a doctor, and you wanted to cure yourself, would you just pick up a medical textbook and read it for yourself? A medical textbook should be easy for you, not 'vague' at all. Or, would you perhaps realise that you don't know as much as someone trained in the art, and ask them?\n\n \n I don't in any way see a priest as equivelant to a doctor. A doctor's \"art\" is the product of science. A more accurate comparison to a priest would be a film critic. I don't need one of those to decide whether or not I liked a movie.\n \n \nYou yourself describe the 'book' as 'vague. Therefore you'd think it would need interpretation! Or, are you trying to have both sides of the argument again?\n\n \n Of course it needs interpretation. That's how the scam works, or haven't you been paying attention? If someone convinced me that 'The Cat In The Hat' contained the secret to eternal life I'd be pretty dependant on them to interpret it for me.\n \n \nDefine 'harm' if you would.\n\n \n It comes down to empathy and the golden rule. If I would consider it harmful to me then I'll try to avoid doing it to anyone else.\n \n \nWhat do you do when you meet someone devoid of the same 'humanistic' standards as yourself, such as a robber? Do you then harm them as much as they harm you? What is the scale?\n\n \n I would do the minimum necessary to protect my life. I would seek recourse through our democraticaly agreed upon laws. I would not seek an eye for an eye.\n \n \nWhy are you against Christianity? You must be assuming that I am causing harm to others.\n\n \n I'm against Christianity because it's directly responsible for so much violence, war, torture, persecution, and bigotry. I believe that throughout history religion has been a much greater source of division and conflict than it's been a source of goodness. I'm against it because I believe it's a lie that convinces people that this life only matters as a proving ground for the next one, and that it's more important for you to please the church than to enjoy your one and only life. I'm also against religion (not just Christianity) because if there actually was a God I'd have to accept that he's a sadist.",

   "Okay, so if we only need 10 laws then they must be, without any doubt, the 10 most important rules possible that would serve mankind throughout history. Not coveting your neighbour's oxen made the list? Why is not creating any graven images more important than not enslaving people? That didn't even make the list. If those 10 things were all that God intended to impart on mankind I have to question his mental competence.\n\n \n You've done exactly what the Jews did. They wanted to elaborate on the laws, and now you are asking for the same. Why 10, why not 11. If there were 11, you'd ask why not 12, or 8? It is a way of arguing for no real purpose, you'd just continue to question it, because you don't believe in it anyway. As I said, the Jews wanted it elaborated. It wouldn't matter if there were 9,000 laws, you'd find something and ask, \"Is this legal?\"\n \n What do you care about slavery; if it's lawful, you'd have to accept it, because later in your post you talk about respecting the democratic decisions of your country.\n \n montalban:\n So you'd advocate a relationship with God that would go something like this...\n SO, I could wake up and say \"God, should I get out of bed now?\"\n \"YES\"\n \"God, should I go to the loo (toilet) now?\"\n \"YES\"\n etc\n BECAUSE that way, according to you I'd be 100% clear about what God wants. If you wouldn't do this to your own children, why do you think your heavenly Father would? That system still allows for personal choice, I could still decide to have breakfast, despite the commandment not to.\n \n \nNo. You're missing the point. We're talking about being provided with moral absolutes here, not a daily itinerary.\n\n \n Err, no you're missing the point. You wanted to know why God didn't spell everything out. That's what would end up happening. We'd have to consult God on every thing, in case we're going to sin. Your criticism was that God should have made everything more clear - based on your own judgment of what 'more clear' is. The clearest you could get is if God spelt absolutely every single act out - and told you whether it was right or wrong.\n \n montalban' If I can look at your latter statement first, in fact I'll deal with your points in reverse order... on government... So you're against laws or laws made by governments? Obviously if you are against a country, then you are being to a degree unpatriotic. \n \n \nAgain, you're missing my point. I'm not against laws. I'm against manipulation. The concept of \"patriotism\" is most often used to suppress dissent. If someone starts asking too many questions you accuse them of being unpatriotic. The current administration used it brilliantly. After 9/11 the Democrats were so afraid of being labelled unpatriotic (and possibly losing votes) that they rolled over and let the Bush administration railroad things like the patriot act through congress mostly unopposed. In religion the concept of \"faith\" is used the same way, only instead of worrying about your chances for re-election you're worried about your chances for admittance to heaven. It suppresses dissent.\n\n \n Define 'manipulation' if you would. If you are suggesting that the Bible's been 'manipulated' to circumvent dissent then you're wrong.\n There is dissent in Christianity. What is your point? There is one Bible, and 10,000's Christian churches. Obviously people are questioning all the time.\n \n Regarding 9/11's laws I thought you respected democracy. Now you're setting yourself up as the ultimate arbiter of what's right and wrong, simply because you don't like the laws they passed.",

   "Of course Christians ask questions, but ultimately the promised reward and threatened punishment outweigh them. If you're talking about giving up eternal life and risking eternal hellfire most people will eventually choose to tow the line just in case, as evidenced by the increasing importance of religion in people's lives as they get closer to death.\n\n \n Maybe, but why then is there still sin? It is because people like yourself don't really believe in any reward or punishment. People think they're not going to get caught. I'm afraid that despite all the 'manipulation' people still go on making mistakes.\n \n montalban:\n What have you got in favour of impure thoughts? Obviously if they're bad, you shouldn't be relishing them.\n \n \nWho gets to decide what's impure? I'm not in favour of thoughts about things that are harmful to other people. I'm even less in favour of anyone claiming that they should make those judgements for me. That's not to say I'm an anarchist who's against law. Democratically agreed upon laws are necessary for the healthy functioning of society.\n\n \n Now you're now arguing a different tact, you said that the Church forbids impure thoughts, masturbation and sex for purposes other than pregnancy. And you're against this! Therefore you're against the church telling you not to have impure thoughts. Are you now saying that you're in favour of impure thoughts?\n \n As for democratic laws - obviously you do support slavery, because the US had slaves. Australia had 'indentured workres' and Britain had slaves. If 78% of your country want to enslave the remainder, then that is the will of the vast majority. Obviously it helps to appeal to a higher authority.\n \n But, no, wait. A moment ago you claimed that the democracy that is the USA was 'manipulated' because laws were passed that you don't agree with. So you're not really in favour of democracy.\n \n montalban:\n As for masturbation, we are against all forms of self-abuse. (http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/selfabuse.htm).\n \n \nAbusing myself? You're only proving my point. Please explain to me how doing something that gives myself pleasure and harms no one is abusing myself? We all have biological and instinctual sexual drives and desires. It's the ideal thing to make you feel guilty about because no one can avoid it, so convincing you that it's something you have to atone for through the church is brilliant. Look how well it works on you.\n\n \n Self-abuse is harming someone. It is harming yourself. Getting drunk can be pleasurable; over-eating; taking drugs; sticking your 'ahem' in the end of a vacuum. If you feel guilty, it is probably because you realise you're doing something wrong. The guilt itself is harmful, for sure; but it would go if you stopped misbehaving.\n \n You might have a biological 'need' does this mean you are right to go express that need with an animal. Would you consider having sex with dead people, or animals to be 'harmless'? because they are not affecting any other person. What about going to the toilet in the middle of your TV room - that's expressing a biological need, and you're 'not harming anyone else'.\n \n montalban:\n You yourself describe the 'book' as 'vague. Therefore you'd think it would need interpretation! Or, are you trying to have both sides of the argument again?\n \n \nOf course it needs interpretation. That's how the scam works, or haven't you been paying attention? If someone convinced me that 'The Cat In The Hat' contained the secret to eternal life I'd be pretty dependant on them to interpret it for me.\n\n \n You've interpreted it as a 'scam'. Based on what? That you disagree with it. The same as the 'scam' you claim exists in the recent laws (post 9/11). There's a wee bit of circular reasoning coming in to play, because you don't believe there's a God, so with that a priori assumption then anyone saying to people there is a God, is to you nonsense, based on your own beliefs. So you are judging Christianity on your own lack of belief. You are right, therefore Christianity is wrong; an attempt by Christians to learn about Christ is fraud.\n \n montalban\n Define 'harm' if you would.\n \n \nIt comes down to empathy and the golden rule. If I would consider it harmful to me then I'll try to avoid doing it to anyone else.\n\n \n Why? A moment ago your wrote about respecting democracy. What if you're one of the 21% that the majority choose to enslave you? Would you respect their democratic rights? Actually, as I've shown, you'd respect the laws only if you felt good about them, you'd claim there was a scam, or a manipulation the moment you don't get your own way. In other words, without recourse to a higher authority, the ultimate judge is you, and as you've demonstrated, you judge things not based on common agreement, but how you feel about an issue.\n \n montalban\n What do you do when you meet someone devoid of the same 'humanistic' standards as yourself, such as a robber? Do you then harm them as much as they harm you? What is the scale?\n \n \nI would do the minimum necessary to protect my life. I would seek recourse through our democratically agreed upon laws. I would not seek an eye for an eye.\n\n \n So the ultimate authority is your democratically agreed laws. You just said you'd use minimum force, but obviously you'd accept the death penalty if applied by your state. How do you protest against an un-just law?\n \n montalban: Why are you against Christianity?

What about the harm done by atheists - or was it a priest who lead Nazi Germany, Communist Russia, China and Cambodia?\n \n If we didn't have Christians, we'd still have slavery. Hume a great atheist want to continue with slavery - it was lawful, and he believe 'natural'. Christians such as Wilberforce and Garrison appealed to a higher authority and had the law changed.",

I'm afraid that despite all the 'manipulation' people still go on making mistakes.\n\n \n Of course people still sin and make mistakes. Religion would lose its hold over people if it asked to avoid doing things that are simple to avoid. If religion commanded you to never kick dogs on thursdays you'd have no trouble doing that. But if religion asks you to avoid sexual thoughts and desires then you're bound to screw that up. Religion needs you to be afraid that you're in danger of losing your chance at eternal life so you'll stay dependant on the church. It's funny to me how you assume that it's all the atheists out there sinning and commiting crimes. You obviously don't know many atheists. In general they're far more \"christlike\" than most Christians. You can argue that all you want but unless you personally know a large number of atheists you're only speaking from your own bigoted (and skewed) point of view.\n \n \nNow you're now arguing a different tact, you said that the Church forbids impure thoughts, masturbation and sex for purposes other than pregnancy. And you're against this! Therefore you're against the church telling you not to have impure thoughts. Are you now saying that you're in favour of impure thoughts?\n\n \n I don't believe that sex for purposes other than pregnancy and masturbation are \"impure.\" So yes, I am against the church convincing people that normal healthy acts of pleasure are sinful and impure.\n \n \nAs for democratic laws - obviously you do support slavery, because the US had slaves. Australia had 'indentured workres' and Britain had slaves. If 78% of your country want to enslave the remainder, then that is the will of the vast majority. Obviously it helps to appeal to a higher authority.\n\n \n huh? Are we reading the same thread? Obviously I support slavery? LOL. Where do you get that? If 78% of my country supported slavery I'd be part of the 22% that opposed it. It's a law I would fight to change. On the other hand, if your God (as interpreted by your church) was for slavery, you'd accept it without question because it's \"God's will.\"\n \n \nBut, no, wait. A moment ago you claimed that the democracy that is the USA was 'manipulated' because laws were passed that you don't agree with. So you're not really in favour of democracy.\n\n \n Forgive me for overestimating your ability to read and understand. If you pull your fingers out of your ears and stop going \"lalalalalala\" you might understand a bit more. I'm most definitely in favor of democracy. The manipulation of public sentiment through the use of \"patriotism\" is not an example of the democratic system at work. It's an example of willful manipulation. The current administration crassly manipulated the anger, fear, and patriotism generated by the 9/11 tragedy as a tool to curb civil rights and justify a war that had nothing to do with the tragedy. I'm vehemantly opposed to the manipulation of people's fears for personal or political gain. It's exactly what the church does.\n \n \nSelf-abuse is harming someone. It is harming yourself. Getting drunk can be pleasurable; over-eating; taking drugs; sticking your 'ahem' in the end of a vacuum. If you feel guilty, it is probably because you realise you're doing something wrong. The guilt itself is harmful, for sure; but it would go if you stopped misbehaving.\n \n You might have a biological 'need' does this mean you are right to go express that need with an animal.

What about going to the toilet in the middle of your TV room - that's expressing a biological need, and you're 'not harming anyone else'.\n\n \n How is masturbation harming myself? You didn't answer the question. I find it hilarious that you immediately equate masturbation with having sex with small appliances, dead people, and animals! The fact that you equate them is a perfect illustration of how warped your mind is from religion. Is God the only think keeping YOU from having sex with dead people and farm animals? \n \n \nYou've interpreted it as a 'scam'. Based on what? That you disagree with it. The same as the 'scam' you claim exists in the recent laws (post 9/11). There's a wee bit of circular reasoning coming in to play, because you don't believe there's a God, so with that a priori assumption then anyone saying to people there is a God, is to you nonsense, based on your own beliefs. So you are judging Christianity on your own lack of belief. You are right, therefore Christianity is wrong; an attempt by Christians to learn about Christ is fraud.\n\n \n I think religion is a scam based on the preponderance of evidence of how it's used to control and manipulate people, and the complete lack of evidence that there's a shred of truth to any of its claims. And yes, I am judging Christianity based on my own lack of belief, just as you're judging atheism based on your personal beliefs.\n \n \nWhy? A moment ago your wrote about respecting democracy. What if you're one of the 21% that the majority choose to enslave you? Would you respect their democratic rights? Actually, as I've shown, you'd respect the laws only if you felt good about them, you'd claim there was a scam, or a manipulation the moment you don't get your own way. In other words, without recourse to a higher authority, the ultimate judge is you, and as you've demonstrated, you judge things not based on common agreement, but how you feel about an issue.\n\n \n I respect the system of democracy. I do not blindly respect every law that gets passed. Unlike you, I'm allowed to have personal opinions about the things people tell me I can and cannot do. In case you haven't noticed slavery isn't legal in this democracy so your hypothetical is pointless. I assume you don't blindly accept every law either. I'll take a wild guess that you're not a big fan of separation of chruch and state. As a member of this democracy we are both allowed to question our laws, disagree with them, and work to change them. God's laws on the other hand cannot be questioned of overturned even when they're psychologically harmful (like equating masturbation with having sex with dead people and animals... get therapy!). \"God's laws\" are just as man made as our democratic laws but you don't get to vote on them.\n \n \nSo the ultimate authority is your democratically agreed laws. You just said you'd use minimum force, but obviously you'd accept the death penalty if applied by your state. How do you protest against an un-just law?\n\n \n I'm against the death penalty and when given the chance I will always vote against it. Like I said, I don't believe in an eye for an eye... I guess you missed that part. I protest unjust laws through the democratic process.\n \n \nWhy is God a sadist?\n\n \n God is a sadist because if he exists he does nothing to stop the suffering, starvation, disease, warfare, torture, and all the other horrendous causes of suffering in the world. If he is omnipresent and omnipotent than he's directly responsible for all of it. That he would let it continue despite the fact that he would have the power to prevent it (and never let any of it come into existence in the first place) then it must be assumed that he's a sadist.\n \n \nIf we didn't have Christians, we'd still have slavery.\n\n \n HAHAHA! The only reason we don't have slavery is because of Christians?! That's quite a statement! And it shows a complete ignorance of history. I guess it was only atheists that had slaves? Can you tell me of a single instance in the Bible where it says that slavery is immoral and wrong? Jesus never spoke out against slavery even though he acknowledged it by instructing slave owners to beat their servants if they refused to convert. \n \n Thomas Paine (who is widely believed to have been an atheist, but was actually a deist who deemed all organized religions to be frauds) was one of the drafters of, and a signer of the March 1,1780 Act of Pennsylvania which abolised slavery in that state - the first negro-emancipation legislation in the United States.\n \n Thomas Paine on Slavery: \"That some desperate wretches should be willing to steal and enslave men by violence and murder for gain, is rather lamentable than strange. But that many civilized, nay, christianized people should approve, and be concerned in the savage practice, is surprising; and still persist, though it has been so often proved contrary to the light of nature, of every principle of Justice and Humanity, and even good policy, by a succession of eminent men, and several late publications. Our Traders in MEN ( an unnatural commodity!) must know the wickedness of the SLAVE-TRADE, if they attend to reasoning, or the dictates of their own hearts: and such as shun and stiffle all these, wilfully sacrifice Conscience, and the character of integrity to that golden Idol.\"\n \n \"The past treatment of Africans must naturally fill them with abhorrence of Christians; lead them to think our religion would make them more inhuman savages, if they embraced it; thus the gain of that trade has been pursued in oppositions of the redeemer's cause, and the happiness of men.\"\n \n Thomas Paine on God: \"\"Whence arose all the horrid assassinations of whole nations of men, women, and infants, with which the Bible is filled; and the bloody persecutions, and tortures unto death, and religious wars, that since that time have laid Europe in blood and ashes; whence arose they, but from this impious thing called religion, and this monstrous belief that God has spoken to man?\"",

I guess it was only atheists that had slaves? Can you tell me of a single instance in the Bible where it says that slavery is immoral and wrong? Jesus never spoke out against slavery even though he acknowledged it by instructing slave owners to beat their servants if they refused to convert\n \n \n However, you didn't mention Locke who helped draft a constitution too, and he established slavery. \" he wrote the \"Fundamental Constitutions for the Government of Carolina\" in 1669\"... \"Black chattel slavery received particular sanction and protection under Locke's law: \"\n http://users.cyberone.com.au/myers/locke.html\n \n \"...echoed in Liberal John Locke's defence of slavery as \"Property.\"[18] Quesnay's and Mandeville doctrine of \"let the Satan whom Smith esteems as the knowing Director of nature, fix the dice,\" is echoed by Adam Smith's 1759 The Theory of the Moral Sentiments, as in his anti-American tract of 1776, The Wealth of Nations\"\n http://www.larouchepub.com/lar/2003/3002believe_know.html\n In other words, governments, churches etc, had no right to impose laws. Let nature sought things out. If some people are slaves, then it is natural for them to be so.\n \n \"It?s a historical fact, as we have amply shown in Q&A: Racism. The leading evolutionist, Stephen Jay Gould (an atheist and Marxist as well as an anti-racist), wrote (Ontogeny and Phylogeny, Belknap-Harvard Press, Cambridge, MA, USA, pp. 127?128, 1977):\n ?Biological arguments for racism may have been common before 1859, but they increased by orders of magnitude following the acceptance of evolutionary theory.?\"\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/feedback/negative6March2001.asp (this site also gives a good list of Christians against slavery... but here's an important thing to look at...\n \"...Wilberforce, Sharp and their allies had to battle prevailing attitudes like, ?Humanity is a private feeling, not a public principle to act upon? (Earl of Abingdon) and ?Things have come to a pretty pass when religion is allowed to invade public life? (Lord Melbourne). It is also notable that pagan philosophers such as Aristotle regarded some people as ?natural slaves?, and ?Enlightenment? philosophers hostile to Christianity such as Hume and Voltaire believed in inferiority of dark-skinned people. \" (Ibid)\n \n So much for 'Christians butting-in on your private values. Humanists would have said that it was a human right to be left to decide things for yourself. If you want to keep slaves at home, then governments and churches should butt out. This same attitude allows a plethora of guns to be kept in easy reach of millions of American children. America was founded on such principles; that is why it continued to allow slavery for as long as it did.\n \n Anyway..\n \n Slavery pre-dates Christianity, so Christianity can't be blamed for slavery.\n \n But as I said the leaders of the anti-slave movement in the US and Britain were Christian, such as Garrison (US) and Wilberforce (GB). \"Prior to the 1861-1865 War, there were a number of Christian abolitionists (Rev. Fee, Cheever, Weld, Rankin, Foster, Goodell, Pillsbury, etc.) opposing slavery. Nowadays, their Bible-based reasons for doing so are generally unknown.\"\n http://members.tripod.com/medicolegal/keytom.htm#p115\n \n They pushed for Christian values.\n \n Atheists such as Hume opposed it. Locke did too. They thought that slavery was natural. When Locke generally terms freedom from slavery, he is talking about from the government.\n \n Lincoln believe that the USA must either be all slave or all free, this was an economic pragmatism that betrayed his real lack of moral leadership on the issue... thus the Emancipation Proclamation didn't free ALL slaves, just those in areas still 'in rebellion.'\n \n \n Those atheists who were against slavery were forced to use moral arguments; based on their own idea of fair-play. Those Christians who supported slavery mainly tried to worm Christianity into it; but they were going against the teachings of Christ. They were arguing in spite of Christ's message.\n \n And don't forget, you yourself based what is moral on what is democratic. You were not the only one. Lots of atheists were prepared to sit on their arse and say \"Well, if it's the law, let's leave it at that!\" or \"I might be against it, but who am I to tell people what is right and what is wrong?\"\n \n But it was Christians who saw beyond the limits of the law, to man's intrinsic worth (their Godness) that had it changed.\n \n See also http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14036a.htm\n \n \n So in summary, your own private feelings on this, or your acquiesce to a democratic model would not have ended slavery. Christianity ended it. That Paine didn't establish slavery was based on just how he felt about it. He didn't impose non-slavery.",

If they were religious, or speaking to religious people, they would use religion, and so on, but I doubt you can find evidence to back up the claim that Christianity ended slavery.

And this may be noble. But does it stop there? How far does it go? The (true) Christian goes much further, all the way to sacrifice. This means that he may suffer detriment to grant you benefit. He does not simply grant you benefit because it works out well for everyone. Christianity cannot be selfish. Christ gave up his life willingly for others. He said, \"There is no greater love than to give up one's life for another.\" (I am not seeking to compete with you on who is the better man--atheist or religious--I am simply presenting the Christian view. That is, the authentic Christian view cannot be selfish)",

   "Actually, I think abolitionists and slave resistance ended slavery. I don't really think it had to do with Christians or atheists, either way. If they were religious, or speaking to religious people, they would use religion, and so on, but I doubt you can find evidence to back up the claim that Christianity ended slavery. Especially since Christianity had been kicking around the continent for a while before slavery was legally abolished.\n\n \n A while ago people were arguing that Christians were responsible for lots of crimes, such as the Crusades\n \n I argued that they were acting bad, in spite of their Christianity.\n \n Now, you are suggesting that they did good in spite of their Christianity.\n \n It was natural, yes for religious people speaking to religious people to use religion. What could atheists use? Most of the atheists here talk about 'live and let live' and not judging people. Therefore, to condemn another's belief would be hypocritical. Furthermore, one poster in particular (Peregrine) judges what's good based on democracy. Slavery existed in a deomcracy therefore slavery was 'good'\n \n Christians acted on principles that over-arch all earthly laws.\n \n \nI'm definitely in favour of impure thoughts. All acts of consensual love and/or pleasure are party as far as I'm concerned.\n\n \n Impure thoughts don't lead to pure love.\n \n 'Christian' sexual love is an expression of pure love, otherwise it's just self-gratification. As God out of pure love gave to us, we out of pure love give our all to our partner. If you start having impure thoughts, like thinking of doing something else, whilst making love, or of being somewhere else, or with someone else, then that is impure. If you're there out of selfishness, just for meeting your own needs, that too will be impure.\n \n You can have 'consensual' love such as between a man and a prostitute. Both are consenting parties, but it is not 'love'. It is exploitation, each attempting to get from it some selfish need.\n \n By your definition, could an animal be 'consenting' if you have sex with it and it doesn't bite. Would this make it okay?\n \n What about children who would submit to an authority figure - leading you to believe that it was the same consent as when an adult 'consents' to sex: this is also occurring in adults when they use the term 'date rape'. A woman, usually young, who goes out on a date has so much pressure put on her that she gives into sexual advances that she wouldn't have otherwise done so; and regrets this in the cold light of day.\n \n \nMasturbation is good for you. Did you know that doctors used to prescribe vibrators to women in the 1800s to heal symptoms such as \"hysteria\", \"frigidity\", and \"anxiety\"? Now that's health care!\n\n \n I'm not sure if using 1800s medicine as a justification is such a good rhetorical ploy, otherwise I'm going to have to enter other exhibits, such as the fact that doctors would proscribe mercury, and maudlin (the latter being opium).\n \n The fact they used the word hysteria is not to be over-looked. It derives from the same root-word that gives us hysterectomy. They believed that mental illness in the unborn child could be caused by the woman (men did not get the blame for such things).\n \n Masturbation is not on the top 10 sins of the Orthodox Church. As far as I understand it, it is a sin if done to the exclusion of all else; because of it's selfish nature; whereas God encouraged certain relationships because of their selflessness; which in turn reflects on and celebrates God's own selflessness.",

   "Most of the atheists here talk about 'live and let live' and not judging people. Therefore, to condemn another's belief would be hypocritical. \n\n \n Well, I do believe that \"live and let live\" is usually just a euphemism for \"if I openly agree I'll have to admit I'm not a nice person\". So people might well have argued that, I don't know. However, most people who ascribe to that philosophy qualify it with \"as long as they're not hurting anybody\" or \"as long as they're just living their lives\". I don't think that supporting slavery falls into the category that most people can openly describe as \"just living your life\".\n \n \nFurthermore, one poster in particular (Peregrine) judges what's good based on democracy. Slavery existed in a deomcracy therefore slavery was 'good'\n\n \n The US is not and never was a democracy. It wouldn't follow that a policy which effected one population in particular but in which they had no say is a democratic decision.\n \n \n\n By your definition, could an animal be 'consenting' if you have sex with it and it doesn't bite. Would this make it okay?\n\n \n I thought it would be obvious that ability to consent be considered. Dead bodies, unconcious or near-unconcious people, animals and children cannot be considered to have consented. Neither can someone whose life depends upon the other person. Consent, by the way, is not merely a lack of protest. It's a little disturbing that I have to explain this. \n \n \nYou can have 'consensual' love such as between a man and a prostitute. Both are consenting parties, but it is not 'love'. It is exploitation, each attempting to get from it some selfish need.\n\n \n Consent in sex work, as in all cases, depends on the situation. If it is consensual, then there's nothing wrong with it. It may that making sex a financial exchange is debasing, but no more so than making art or marriage a financial exchange, which they are more often than not.\n \n I don't think there is anything wrong with seeking to have your needs fulfilled, whether they are sexual gratification or paying the rent. Usually sex work is more about companionship and acceptance than sex itself. In any case, I don't see what's unethical about that.\n \n Sex doesn't have to be about \"love\", in the sense you mean, for it to be \"moral\". But anyway, if it was always about consensual love, than why would gay sex be immoral? It's not about love to you, it's about rules.\n \n \nI'm not sure if using 1800s medicine as a justification is such a good rhetorical ploy,\n\n \n I wouldn't call it a \"rhetorical ploy\". I just thought it was funny. \n \n Masturbation is still good for you.\n \n \nmaudlin (the latter being opium).\n\n \n See, some of their ideas made sense in spite of themselves.

Six year olds can (and do) experiment with each other sexually, to no detriment to either of them. However, some children whose siblings of no older than 1 or two years have engaged them in sexual activities have found the experience traumatic.\n \n As well, this includes people of the same age or older than the other person. Therefore, a student/teacher, employee/boss, prisoner/prison guard, etc., power differential makes consent difficult to confirm.\n \n I believe that any situation where another person's consent is ambiguous it is a bad idea to engage in sexual activity with them. An example that comes to mind is if a person has no place to stay and I take them in, I would feel it ambiguous whether the person felt that they could not refuse sexual interaction because it might mean they would be on the street. Any situation where the person cannot safely and easily say no is a situation of questionable consent. I am not suggesting this on a legal basis, but in terms of personal ethics.\n \n \nSince you are fond of history, in the Middle Ages in parts of France, an animal could be found guilty of fornication with a human, because it was deemed to 'consent' if it made no efforts to stop the act. Why can't animals give 'consent'?\n \n I don't have quite these same problems because sex with animals is deemed a sin.\n\n \n Children have been found guilty of \"seduction\" of adults in history as well. \n \n Are you suggesting that if sex with animals weren't a sin you wouldn't have a problem with it, or might do it yourself? \n \n \nHowever, I can see that the issue of 'consent' would still be problematic, even within a Christian relationship - because rape can occur within marriage... however, it would still be immoral to Christians.... and even if the woman was coerced not to go to court (where you'd have to leave it at that), for Christians God will still be judging.\n\n \n Again, I don't believe the law has anything necessarily to do with ethics. Where I live, however, husbands can be found guilty of raping their wives. \n \n I don't see that as necessarily an issue of consent, but of ignored dissent. That is, generally in cases of sexual assault by a familiar person, the victim/survivor clearly did not consent, but this was ignored by the assailant.\n \n Also, for many Christians God does not believe husbands can rape their wives. \n \n \nfrom the looks of it, what's right and what's wrong, for you, is solely how you feel at the time.

I hope this isn't a misrepresentation.\n \n Finally, I accept that Hindus, Muhammedans, Jews, non-Orthodox Christians believe in higher (over-arching) morals. I've NEVER said otherwise. I may have said I think what they believe is wrong; but that's different.\n \n You're a strange case though because I can look up a Catholic Catechism for instance, and say \"This is what the majority of Catholics believe in, or should be taught to believe in\"\n HOWEVER\n There's no wicca/pagan equivelent. There's a number of web-sites but many talk past each other.\n \n Is there a definitive web-site you'd like to recommend to all the folks out there at home?",

   "The question posed by Maximus in post 1\n How does an atheist discern what is fair or unfair?\n \n Some have suggest various utilitarian models; that is, they would look at what is best as considered by the most people.\n \n At Post46 I responded.\n \"The ultimate sanction, therefore, of all morality...being a subjective feeling in our own minds...\" J S Mill & J Bentham \"Utilitarianism and Other Essays\", Penguin Classics, p301.\n \n Under utilitarianism you'd still be able to have slavery - as in the USA, slaves were a minority, thus for the most good, slaves could be of some benefit - minding the kids as you go to work etc. At post65 this same writer boasted \"\"...The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion...\" treaty with Tripoli, passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate and signed by president Adams on June 10, 1797\" Therefore it wasn't Christians who established slavery in the US! It was atheists or deists!\n \n One poster at Post59 said\n \"I'm truly astounded by the simple minded arguments being put forth in this thread. It boggles my mind that religious people (and Christians in particular) believe there can be no morality or ethics without the existence of God. Apparently the concept of common sense is completely beyond you. Do you honestly believe that without being under the yoke of God you'd all be out raping, pillaging, and murdering? If so it's a damn good thing you have that myth keeping you all under control. \"\n \n My claim was never that atheists can have morals, but that their morals must be based on their own perceptions of what is right and what is wrong - rather than having recourse to an over-arching supernatural source. It is in a sense an individualistic approach to morality. (Utilitarianism is simply a lot of people having individualistic approaches - because no matter how many there are, none are appealing to a higher/supernatural source; the difference being between basing your beliefs on one flawed individual, and a collection of flawed individuals).\n \n The same poster in Post62 said \" ALL morality is relative... even for Christians since there's a wide variance in interpretation. \"\n and\n \"Why would I be pro-religion if I believe that God is a myth? I'm pro-humanism\"\n \n The same poster asked at Post65\n \"Do you also believe that empathy is impossible in the absence of God?\"\n \n This is a nonsense question. Everyone has feelings. However an atheist, if doing good must not be doing it for religious reasons, but selfish reasons; because he feels good about it. Not because it is 'right' in an absolute sense, because the atheist doesn't believe in a single over-arching sense of what is right... only what is right for him, and hoping it is right for others as well.\n He confirms this in the same post when he says \"A conviction that dogmas, ideologies and traditions, whether religious, political or social, must be weighed and tested by each individual and not simply accepted on faith.\" That is, what is right for one person is judged by that one person!\n \n \n So, at best this writer is saying that all our beliefs are based on our own individual judgment... even Christians. So what is fair is up to each individual.\n \n I will have to go now because lunch is ready.",

In fact it would seem to me to applaud whatever benefits the most. Of course, you could argue that the very institution of slavery demeans the whole society and is therefore not a benefit.\n \n Regardless, two facts emerged from these debates. One posted by Peregrine, and some by myself.\n \n Peregrine: The United States was not founded by Christianity\n Montalban: Slavery existed in the United States of America at the time of it's founding.\n Montalban: Slavery in the United States was ended by Christian abolitionists.\n \n People can then draw their own conclusions as to which promoted 'humanism' and which did not.\n \n \ntheir morals must be based on their own perceptions of what is right and what is wrong - rather than having recourse to an over-arching supernatural source.\n\n \n \nYour morals are based on your own perception of right and wrong as well, montalban.

I don't know enough about these laws... but it does seem to me that if they were passed by your Congress then they fall within the scope of democratic process.\n \n I consider laws that we passed here in Australia to be draconian. But I don't think that they are un-democratic. Therefore I have to appeal to morals - something higher than democracy.\n \n \nAs for aver-arching beliefs, many atheists believe in things larger than themselves. Things like Art, Freedom, Democracy, whatever. I don't know that believing in something \"superior\" or above oneself is necessary. I don't see my beliefs that way, more as an interconnectedness, or as something more profound than just the self, but that the self is part of.

I do not look to art to guide me in the way I live.\n \n But again, I must stress. I am not saying that you need to believe in something above you to have morals.\n If you believe in something above you, then your morals must come from above you.\n \n If you believe in nothing above you then your morals must come from you - or another person on your level.

But you really shouldn't quote a web-site if you don't want people to read it.\n \n Your site has a link to another site... \"Hitler Was Not An Atheist\"\n It says that Hitler always considered himself a Catholic and that he said \"Hitler seeking power, wrote in Mein Kampf, \"... I am convinced that I am acting as the agent of our Creator. By fighting off the Jews. I am doing the Lord's work.\" Years later, when in power, he quoted those same words in a Reichstag speech in 1938.\"\n http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/murphy_19_2.html\n \n SO, again I ask you, what was his favourite Biblical passage? What part of the Bible did he use to back up his desire to kill the Jews?

We would do better to discuss what we can know and change: how we relate to the world, interact with people, and perceive situations. We create the moral reality that matters to us. Only when we admit to authoring the values we live by can we seize the power to rethink, revaluate, and replace them. \n \n Alan Watts wrote: \"Empty and nihilistic as it may sound, this recognition of total nakedness and transparency is a joy beyond all telling, for what is empty is not reality itself but all that seems to block its light.\" (3) \n \n Nietzsche asked, \"How could we have a duty toward something unknown?\" (4) Kierkegaard said that declaring it unknown \"does not satisfy the passion\" for moral inquiry.

   "What has 'natural' law got to do with anything?\n \n But anyways...\n Thank you for finally answering\n \n \nI don't believe there are objective truths.\n\n \n We need truths to make sense of the world. For you then, all truths must be subjective. Therefore your sense of right and wrong must only include yourself, unless your reason for arguing against others then is based on some kind of selfish and immediate gratification; because why is your subjective truth more valid than another's subjective truth. Why at all would you consider deriding people who are religious?\n \n What right has someone who acknowledges no real and objective truth to passionately condemn those who believe in God? What then makes your subjective truth so right that it is better then other people's subjective truths?\n \n Yet the paradox is that you do believe in objective truths. Because you state that there is no objective truth, you have declared this to be a truth! Unless this of course is a subjective truth too! Which still begs the question - why argue?\n \n If there are no objective truths then any purpose to life is solely what you make of it. This existentialist belief denies everything other than what can be experienced.\n \n What makes you so passionate then about your subjective truths?\n \n The question for this post is \"How does an atheist determine fairness and unfairness?\"\n For you then, the answer is you. You can be moral, for sure, but it is just good luck that you're nice.\n \n If there are no objective truths, then there can be nothing that exists outside your own experience and knowledge; because they can only be subjective if you subject them to your own reason and experience. Therefore why do you believe that there are other planets, or that evolution took place, or that there are in fact people in Inner Mongolia?\n \n If life is such a series of unrealities (other than those processed by your own self) how can you be sure of anything?

   "Montal, you are being subjective by asserting there is an objective truth based on God.\n \n How does one perceive God? It may have been a traditional belief handed down socially. Instruments can help us perceive objects removed from our frame of reference such as planets or atoms. I hate to paste again, sorry. Here is a link that uses some very good specific examples...\n \n \n In relation to Peter's assertion that we cannot \"experience\" atoms and so forth - \n \n I believe that Tasmania exists. It is something \"physical\" if you like. I have never been there and probably never will, unless I win a lottery, yet every once in a while the phone rings at home and it turns out to be one or other of the two of my sisters who both claim to live there. According to Peter's theory, I have no right to believe that Tasmania really exists, yet for me the only correct inference worth considering is that it does so exist. \n It is possible to introduce various artificial aids and experimental devices between a human and her environment such that the patterns of environmental energy are conveyed to the relevant sensory cells in a manner different from how it would be without them. Spectacles are a simple example: my wife relates how as a child she only discovered for herself that stars were bright dots in the sky when she got her first pair of specks. People had told her about them and those people's description had been the correct one, she just didn't know it yet. Another example - a great Australian contribution to the world I believe - is the cochleal implant. This transduction device reconnects the drum and bones of the inner ear with neurons going into the brain so that the subject hears again. Does Peter Lloyd deny their hearing is real because mediated by metal, silicon and plastic as well as bones, neurons and so forth? \n The last point extends naturally to the vast number of tools and aids to investigation of the world which science and engineering now make available. Instruments - now including the humble PC mouse pointer - are being designed to give vibrations and impulses as indications of the properties of atomic and molecular scale objects, as well much larger things, being measured by remote mechanisms. Peter Lloyd seems to be denying that this can be classed as \"perception\". My understanding however is that habitual users of such devices easily reach a threshold of familiarity after which the device becomes as if an extension of their bodies: they\"feel\" the shape and resistance of the nanometre sized objects. Why is this so hard to accept? This process of perception mediated by transducers, amplifiers and computer chips is very sophisticated but logically is in the same category as using a stick to find one's way around a darkened room, or the measurement process used by \"nudge\" parkers finding out if their car is going to fit into a parking bay. \n \n http://www.geocities.com/markpeaty/things.html#Things%20in%20the%20Brain",

But to go on from there and condemn all similar accounts seems to me to be impudent in the extreme. Such a great saint as Augustine swears that he saw: a blind child restored to sight by the relics of Saint Gervaise and Saint Protasius at Milan; a woman in Carthage cured of a cancer by the sign of the cross made by a woman who had just been baptised; his close friend Hesperius driving off devils (who were infesting his house) by using a little soil taken from the sepulchre of our Lord, and that same soil, borne into the Church, suddenly curing a paralytic; a woman who, having touched the reliquary of Saint Stephen with a posy of flowers during a procession, rubbed her eyes with them afterwards and recovered her sight which she had recently lost... What are we to accuse him of - hum and the two holy bishops, Aurelius and Maximinus, whom he calls on as witnesses? Is it of ignorance, simple-mindedness, credulity, deliberate deception or imposture? ....

I have no reason to doubt them. To a degree I am accepting them because I already believe in God; just as you reject evidence on an a priori belief as well.

The hedonism of the atheist has always been a minority. Even many atheists recognise positivist arguments for religion - if only as a force of social stability.\n \n *my own mind which acknowledges that I exist, if it is logical for me to accept that I exist, then I can conclude that my mind is capable of knowing somethings that are, and somethings that aren't.

Man's standard of value, say the mystics of spirit, is the pleasure of God, whose standards are beyond man's power of comprehension and must be accepted on faith....The purpose of man's life...is to become an abject zombie who serves a purpose he does not know, for reasons he is not to question. [Ayn Rand, For the New Intellectual]\n \n \n \n For centuries, the mystics of spirit had existed by running a protection racket - by making life on earth unbearable, then charging you for consolation and relief, by forbidding all the virtues that make existence possible, then riding on the shoulders of your guilt, by declaring production and joy to be sins, then collecting blackmail from the sinners. [Ayn Rand, For the New Intellectual]\n \n \n \n ...if devotion to truth is the hallmark of morality, then there is no greater, nobler, more heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking.... the alleged short-cut to knowledge, which is faith, is only a short-circuit destroying the mind. [Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged]\n \n \n \n Playboy: Has no religion, in your estimation, ever offered anything of constructive value to human life? \n Ayn Rand: Qua religion, no - in the sense of blind belief, belief unsupported by, or contrary to, the facts of reality and the conclusions of reason. Faith, as such, is extremely detrimental to human life: it is the negation of reason. But you must remember that religion is an early form of philosophy, that the first attempts to explain the universe, to give a coherent frame of reference to man's life and a code of moral values, were made by religion, before men graduated or developed enough to have philosophy. And, as philosophies, some religions have very valuable moral points. They may have a good influence or proper principles to inculcate, but in a very contradictory context and, on a very - how should I say it? - dangerous or malevolent base: on the ground of faith. [Playboy interview with Ayn Rand]\n \n \n \n If you get caught at some crucial point and somebody tells you that your doctrine doesn't make sense - you're ready for him. You tell him there's something above sense. That here he must not try to think, he must feel. He must believe. Suspend reason and you can play it deuces wild. [Ayn Rand, The Fountainhead]\n \n \n \n And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant them joy and peace and pride.\n \n \n \n This god, this one word: I. [Ayn Rand, Anthem]\n \n \n \n If I were to speak your kind of language, I would say that man's only moral commandment is: Thou shalt think. But a 'moral commandment' is a contradiction in terms. The moral is the chosen, not the forced; the understood, not the obeyed. The moral is the rational, and reason accepts no commandments.\n \n \n \n There has never been a philosophy, a theory or a doctrine, that attacked (or 'limited') reason, which did not preach submission to the power of some authority. [Ayn Rand, The Comprachicos, in The New Left]\n \n \n \n Are you in a universe which is ruled by natural laws and, therefore, is stable, firm, absolute - and knowable? Or are you in an incomprehensible chaos, a realm of inexplicable miracles, an unpredictable, unknowable flux, which your mind is impotent to grasp? The nature of your actions - and of your ambition - will be different, according to which set of answers you come to accept.\n \n \n \n (The Doctrine of Original Sin) declares that (man) ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge - he acquired a mind and became a rational being. It was the knowledge of good and evil - he became a moral being/ He was sentenced to earn his bread by his labor - he became a productive being. He was sentenced to experience desire - he acquired the capacity of sexual enjoyment. The evils for which (the preachers) damn him are reason, morality, creativeness joy - all the cardinal values of his existence.\n \n \n \n The alleged short-cut to knowledge, which is faith, is only a short circuit destroying the mind.\n \n \n \n Faith is the wors curse of mankind, as the exact antithesis and enemy of thought.\n \n \n \n [T]he only real moral crime that one man can commit against another is the attempt to create, by his words or actions, an impression of the contradictory, the impossible, the irrational, and thus shake the concept of rationality in his victim.\n \n \n \n Definitions are the guardians of rationality, the first line of defense against the chaos of mental disintegration.\n \n \n \n To fear to face an issue is to believe the worst is true.\n \n \n \n Thinking men cannot be ruled.\n \n \n \n To rest one's case on faith means to concede that reason is on the side of one's enemies- that one has no rational arguments to offer.\n \n \n \n ...if devotion to truth is the hallmark of morality, then there is no greater, nobler, more heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking.... the alleged short-cut to knowledge, which is faith, is only a short-circuit destroying the mind. [Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged]\n \n \n \n \"Do not lose your knowledge that man's proper estate is an upright posture, an intransigent mind, and a step that travels unlimited roads.\" [John Galt, in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged]",

   "Using ciruclar arguments about \"faith\" is not logical. Morality is a philosophy and a human social construct. It must be understood, if it is the truth, it must be thought about, whether one belives in God or not. If it cannot stand up to questioning and reason, and must only rely on unquestioning obedience or faith in something inconceivable for reasons one is not to question, that particular \"morality\", if we can call it that, does not deserve to survive. Those who believe in God, cannot defend their morality in this way. I belive in what Rand says about reason not being commanded. Atheists can defend their morality. \n \n I will post quotes if I desire, dreamweaver, you are not the boss of me. Surely you can do better than calling Ayn Rand names.\n \n Some Pascal quotes...\n \n \"It is incomprehensible that God should exist, and it is incomprehensible that He should not exist; that the soul should be joined to the body, and that we should have no soul; that the world should be created, and that it should not be created, etc.; that original sin should be, and that it should not be.\"\n \n \"But you must wager. It is not optional. You are embarked. Which will you choose then? Let us see. Since you must choose, let us see which interests you least. You have two things to lose, the true and the good; and two things to stake, your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to shun, error and misery. Your reason is no more shocked in choosing one rather than the other, since you must of necessity choose. This is one point settled. But your happiness? Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation that He is.\"\n \n Roll the dice, on faith?\n \n \"Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from a religious conviction.\"\n \n Pascal said this, not me. \n \n \n \"The heart has its reasons which reason knows nothing of.\" \n \n What is this supposed to mean? \n \n \"We do not require great education of the mind to understand that here is no real and lasting satisfaction; that our pleasures are only vanity; that our evils are infinite; and, lastly, that death, which threatens us every moment, must infallibly place us within a few years under the dreadful necessity of being for ever either annihilated or unhappy.\"\n \n \n \"Without Jesus Christ man must be in vice and misery; with Jesus Christ man is free from vice and misery; in Him is all our virtue and all our happiness. Apart from Him there is but vice, misery, darkness, death, despair.\"\n \n Yet I thought our only options were death or unhappiness?

We know life and death only through Jesus Christ. Apart from Jesus Christ, we do not know what is our life, nor our death, nor God, nor ourselves.\"\n \n \"I see many contradictory religions, and consequently all false save one.

He wrote several books in which he expressed his deeply religious feelings, his humanism and thoughts about the relation between science and religion.\n \n \n Blaise Pascal:\n \n \"Those to whom God has imparted religion by intuition are very fortunate and justly convinced.

I want to hold them together, as far as I am able, without dishonesty and without compartmentalism. I don't want to be a priest on Sunday and a physicist on Monday; I want to be both on both days.\" \n \n \n Albert Einstein, Nobel prize 1921:\n \n He expressed his understanding of the orderly arrangement of the word like this:\n \n \"This firm belief, a belief bound up with deep feeling, in a superior mind that reveals itself in the world of experience, represents my conception of God.\"\n \"A knowledge of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds - it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity; in this sense and in this sense alone, I am a deeply religious man.\" \n \n When asked how he discovered his relativity theory, Einstein replied...\n \n \"...What is the meaning of human life or, for that matter, of the life of any creature? To know an answer to this question means to be religious.\" \n \n Everyone has heard of Einstein... need I tell you about him?\n \n \n Spinoza:\n \n \"The more we know of things, the more we know of God.\" \n \n \n Copernicus:\n \n \"Through steady observation and a meaningful contact with the divined order of the world's structure, arranged by God's wisdom, - who would not be guided to admire the Builder who creates all!\" \n \n Kepler:\n \n \"Work on astronomy means reading God's thoughts.\"\n \"The (physical) laws are within the limits of the human spirit's capacity to comprehend; God's wish was to let us recognize them.\"\n \"I thank thee, Lord God our Creator, that thou allowest me to see the beauty in thy work of creation.\" \n \n Kopernik/ Copernicus gave us the heliocentric system which Kepler accepted. Kepler is known as a founder of dynamical astronomy. He said that planets move around the sun in elliptical paths, which the sun at one focus. \n Both Kepler and Kopernik expressed their deep religious convictions strongly supported by their discoveries.\n \n \n Walter Heitler: - theoretical physicist\n \n \"A contradiction (between science and religion) is out of the question. What follows from science are, again and again, clear indications of God's activity which can be so strongly perceived that Kepler dared to say (for us it seems daring, not for him) that he could 'almost touch God with his hand in the Universe.'\"\n \n \n Isaac Newton:\n \n \"The wonderful arrangement and harmony of the cosmos would only originate in the plan of an almighty omniscient being. This is and remains my greatest comprehension.\" \n \n Hardly anybody would deny that Isaac Newton belongs among the world's greatest physicists. Classical mechanics is based on his laws of motion.

This theory contributed to the first attempt to systematize organic chemistry. Liebig also suggested the use of mineral fertilizers when some soil elements were depleted.\n \n \n Rober Mayer:\n \n \"I end my life with the deep, heartfelt conviction that real, true natural science and philosophy must lead to faith in God and the Christian religion .\" \n \n \n Prescot James Joule:\n \n \"We meet a great variety of phenomena which speak in plain language of the wisdom and blessed hand of the nature's architect.\" \n \n \n William Kelvin, later Lord Thomson:\n \n \"Overwhelming evidences of an intelligence and benevolent intention surround us, show us the whole of nature through the work of a free will and teach us that all alive beings depend on an eternal creator-ruler.\" \n \n \n Walter Nernst:\n \n \"To work in physics means to observe God's creation.\" \n \n Robert Mayer, James Joule, William Kelvin , and Walter Nernst, together with several other physicists, are regarded as the founders of thermodynamics.

He prayed daily.

The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublimation of that old conception of the gods. Its anthropomorphic character is shown, for instance, by the fact that men appeal to the Divine Being in prayers and plead for the fulfillment of their wishes... In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vase power in the hands of priests.

Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached a conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true....Suspicion against every kind of authority grew out of this experience...an attitude which has never left me.\" [The Quotable Einstein]\n \n There is nothing divine about morality, it is a purely human affair. -- Albert Einstein, \"The World As I See It,\" 1949, pp. 28-29\n \n I do not believe in the immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it. -- Albert Einstein\n \n A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeeded be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death. -- Albert Einstein\n \n All our science, measured against reality, is primitive and childlike--and yet it is all we have. -- Albert Einstein\n \n I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotism. -- Albert Einstein\n \n If this being is omnipotent, then every occurrence, including every human action, every human thought, and every human feeling and aspiration is also His work; how is it possible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an almighty Being? In giving out punishment and rewards He would to a certain extent be passing judgement on Himself.

People have vivid hallucinations. How do you distinguish between altered states of consciousness? \"If someone who has had an experience that tells us something about the universe that we didn't know and that later turns out to be true, then we'd have to say, 'My goodness.' \" But that, he said, \"would have to be more than the anecdotal reports that typically are used to support religious experiences.\"\n \n \n \"It is said that men may not be the dreams of the Gods, but rather that the Gods are the dreams of men.\"\n \n \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\"\n \n \n It is properly said that the Devil can \"quote Scripture to his purpose.\" The Bible is full of so many stories of contradictory moral purpose that every generation can find scriptural justification for nearly any action it proposes--from incest, slavery, and mass murder to the most refined love, courage, and self-sacrifice. And this moral multiple personality disorder is hardly restricted to Judaism and Christianity. -- Carl Sagan, \"The Demon-Haunted World\" (p. 290-1)\n \n If you accept the literal truth of every word of the Bible, then the Earth must be flat. The same is true for the Qu'ran. Pronouncing the Earth round then means you're an atheist.

Anyone of the round persuasion does not believe in God and should be punished. -- Carl Sagan, \"The Demon-Haunted World,\" p. 325",

Even when we are in heaven and with Him, we will never know all of Him. It remains out of reach of humans to know the unknowable. We can however catch glimpses of His truth.\n \n God for instance calls Himself 'He' but He is only doing so because we need a reference point. He has chosen the analogy of a Father, and we thus call Him that.\n \n I think I have also told you that I am able to question Orthodoxy, but I must also humble myself to the collective wisdom of 2,000 years of thinkers. Who am I to judge? Well, I do my best, but there is a degree of trust. That trust is not blindly given.\n \n When a couple are in love, and married, they may be separate during the day. The woman may trust her husband is not having a fling. There is a reason behind this, because she knows him. Though ultimately, she is still trusting him, because she is not watching him 24hrs a day; but her trust is not unreasonable.\n \n Likewise, I do not know all the teachings of the Orthodox Church. I have a relationship of love with Orthodoxy. I have no reason to doubt it's wisdom in general. On specific issues, I am free to ask, I am free to read what the Church says on certain issues.\n \n I know several Orthodox who do not go to regular Divine Liturgy. That is what we are taught to do; to go regularly - and not just Christmas and Easter. There are two issues here\n a) the Church has not brain-washed anyone - because people are in disobedience\n b) the Church has not excommunicated them for this breach (perhaps they would if they considered a more serious breach).",

   "July 12, 2003 \n The Bright Stuff\n By DANIEL C. DENNETT\n \n BLUE HILL, Me.\n \n The time has come for us brights to come out of the closet. What is a bright? A bright is a person with a naturalist as opposed to a supernaturalist world view. We brights don't believe in ghosts or elves or the Easter Bunny - or God. We disagree about many things, and hold a variety of views about morality, politics and the meaning of life, but we share a disbelief in black magic - and life after death.\n \n The term \"bright\" is a recent coinage by two brights in Sacramento, Calif., who thought our social group - which has a history stretching back to the Enlightenment, if not before - could stand an image-buffing and that a fresh name might help. Don't confuse the noun with the adjective: \"I'm a bright\" is not a boast but a proud avowal of an inquisitive world view.\n \n You may well be a bright. If not, you certainly deal with brights daily. That's because we are all around you: we're doctors, nurses, police officers, schoolteachers, crossing guards and men and women serving in the military. We are your sons and daughters, your brothers and sisters. Our colleges and universities teem with brights. Among scientists, we are a commanding majority. Wanting to preserve and transmit a great culture, we even teach Sunday school and Hebrew classes. Many of the nation's clergy members are closet brights, I suspect. We are, in fact, the moral backbone of the nation: brights take their civic duties seriously precisely because they don't trust God to save humanity from its follies. \n \n As an adult white married male with financial security, I am not in the habit of considering myself a member of any minority in need of protection. If anybody is in the driver's seat, I've thought, it's people like me. But now I'm beginning to feel some heat, and although it's not uncomfortable yet, I've come to realize it's time to sound the alarm.\n \n Whether we brights are a minority or, as I am inclined to believe, a silent majority, our deepest convictions are increasingly dismissed, belittled and condemned by those in power - by politicians who go out of their way to invoke God and to stand, self-righteously preening, on what they call \"the side of the angels.\"\n \n A 2002 survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life suggests that 27 million Americans are atheist or agnostic or have no religious preference. That figure may well be too low, since many nonbelievers are reluctant to admit that their religious observance is more a civic or social duty than a religious one - more a matter of protective coloration than conviction.\n \n Most brights don't play the \"aggressive atheist\" role. We don't want to turn every conversation into a debate about religion, and we don't want to offend our friends and neighbors, and so we maintain a diplomatic silence.\n \n But the price is political impotence. Politicians don't think they even have to pay us lip service, and leaders who wouldn't be caught dead making religious or ethnic slurs don't hesitate to disparage the \"godless\" among us.\n \n From the White House down, bright-bashing is seen as a low-risk vote-getter. And, of course, the assault isn't only rhetorical: the Bush administration has advocated changes in government rules and policies to increase the role of religious organizations in daily life, a serious subversion of the Constitution. It is time to halt this erosion and to take a stand: the United States is not a religious state, it is a secular state that tolerates all religions and - yes - all manner of nonreligious ethical beliefs as well.\n \n I recently took part in a conference in Seattle that brought together leading scientists, artists and authors to talk candidly and informally about their lives to a group of very smart high school students. Toward the end of my allotted 15 minutes, I tried a little experiment. I came out as a bright.\n \n Now, my identity would come as no surprise to anybody with the slightest knowledge of my work. Nevertheless, the result was electrifying.\n \n Many students came up to me afterwards to thank me, with considerable passion, for \"liberating\" them. I hadn't realized how lonely and insecure these thoughtful teenagers felt. They'd never heard a respected adult say, in an entirely matter of fact way, that he didn't believe in God. I had calmly broken a taboo and shown how easy it was.\n \n In addition, many of the later speakers, including several Nobel laureates, were inspired to say that they, too, were brights. In each case the remark drew applause. Even more gratifying were the comments of adults and students alike who sought me out afterward to tell me that, while they themselves were not brights, they supported bright rights. And that is what we want most of all: to be treated with the same respect accorded to Baptists and Hindus and Catholics, no more and no less.\n \n If you're a bright, what can you do? First, we can be a powerful force in American political life if we simply identify ourselves. (The founding brights maintain a Web site on which you can stand up and be counted.) I appreciate, however, that while coming out of the closet was easy for an academic like me - or for my colleague Richard Dawkins, who has issued a similar call in England - in some parts of the country admitting you're a bright could lead to social calamity. So please: no \"outing.\"\n \n But there's no reason all Americans can't support bright rights. I am neither gay nor African-American, but nobody can use a slur against blacks or homosexuals in my hearing and get away with it. Whatever your theology, you can firmly object when you hear family or friends sneer at atheists or agnostics or other godless folk.\n \n And you can ask your political candidates these questions: Would you vote for an otherwise qualified candidate for public office who was a bright? Would you support a nominee for the Supreme Court who was a bright? Do you think brights should be allowed to be high school teachers? Or chiefs of police?\n \n Let's get America's candidates thinking about how to respond to a swelling chorus of brights. With any luck, we'll soon hear some squirming politician trying to get off the hot seat with the feeble comment that \"some of my best friends are brights.\" \n \n Daniel C.

   "Image of Virgin is no miracle, scientist says \n \n Associated Press \n \n Monday, June 3, 2002\n \n Jerry Lara SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS-NEWS\n \n This 5-by-3-foot image of the Virgin Mary in a Mexico City basilica, known as Our Lady of Guadalupe, is said to have appeared miraculously on a cloak worn by the Aztec peasant Juan Diego in 1531. \n \n SAN ANTONIO -- Two months before Pope John Paul II is scheduled to canonize the man behind Mexico's most beloved miracle, a San Antonio scientist is protesting the long-awaited event, saying an image of the Virgin Mary believed to have been imprinted on a peasant's cloak is not miraculous at all. \n \n The olive-skinned Virgin Mary known as Our Lady of Guadalupe reportedly appeared to an Aztec peasant in 1531 and turned millions of polytheist Indians into Roman Catholics. Her 5 1/2-by-3 1/2 foot image, which is said to have appeared miraculously on the cloak worn by the peasant Juan Diego, is housed at Mexico City's Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the world's second most popular Catholic site after the Vatican. \n \n In 1990, the pope beatified Juan Diego, the step before full sainthood, and some Catholics have been hoping for centuries for canonization, the ultimate stamp of legitimacy. \n \n But recent studies of the image are feeding centuries-old uncertainty over its origin, says Leoncio Garza-Valdes, 61, who in 1999 was part of a team that evaluated the cloth. \n \n \"The cloak of Our Lady of Guadalupe is not one painting but three paintings, and one is signed and dated. So this is not a miraculous image; it was created by man,\" Garza-Valdes said. \n \n Garza-Valdes, whose conclusions were published last week in the Mexican magazine Proceso, believes the image of the Virgin is not of supernatural origin, and that Juan Diego is a creation of 17th-century church writings. \n \n \"We want to stop the canonization of Juan Diego,\" Garza-Valdes said. \"The church is making a boo-boo. I am a Catholic and a Guadalupano, but I am not an apparitionist and I do not believe in Juan Diego.\" \n \n Garza-Valdes, a pediatrician and microbiologist, said photographs taken of the image in the basilica vault in February 1999, using various filters that allow the passage of ultraviolet and infrared light, revealed three paintings, each painted over another. \n \n In the earliest painting, Garza-Valdes says, the female figure was quite different, and one can see the shadowy presence of a naked baby Jesus, reclining in the Virgin's left arm. \n \n He believes this original image was borrowed from a well-known statue in a basilica in Extremadura, Spain, which he recently inspected. And he says the initials of the artist, M.A. for Marcos Aquino, a historical figure, can be seen in the corner of the painting, next to the date: 1556. \n \n To others, these features are so vague as to be undetectable, and Garza-Valdes could cite no other independent observer who sees them. \n \n In photos of what the scientist calls the second and third Virgins, distinct changes to the figure's facial features are easily seen. In the final image, the eyes of the Virgin have become smaller, and her features are less Indian. And, Garza-Valdes says, her face has been moved roughly 6 inches on the canvas. \n \n Garza-Valdes also says microscopic examination of the canvas fibers reveal it to be made of hemp, typical of 17th-century paintings and not of the Mexican agave cactus. \n \n This conclusion corresponds with those of a church-commissioned study by Jose Sol Rosales. The Mexican expert in art restoration concluded the painting was the work of human artists, using identifiable 17th-century materials and techniques, and was not the result of a supernatural event. \n \n \"Look. This isn't the product of a miracle,\" Rosales said in an article published three weeks ago in Proceso. \"You can identify the various layers (of paint). It has the marks of the paintbrush. But they say it was imprinted miraculously, with no preparation. No, no. This is not so.\" \n \n Mexican church officials say Garza-Valdes is completely mistaken. And two Americans who went with him to Mexico in 1999 to take the photos do not agree with him on critical points. \n \n Dr. Gilberto Aguirre, a San Antonio optometrist and a student of the Virgin, said that because the pictures were taken through a quarter-inch acrylic screen using only ambient light, the images they reveal cannot all be trusted. He also said ultraviolet light cannot reveal subsurface features. \n \n Lester Rosebrook, a photographer at the University of Texas Health Science Center who took the ultraviolet and infrared photos in Mexico, said Garza-Valdes sees specific things that he cannot. \n \n \"I didn't see the baby. If it was there, I think it would have been more clear,\" Rosebrook said. \n \n Monsignor Jose Luis Guerrero, a Mexican priest chosen by the Vatican as the advocate in Juan Diego's canonization cause, said that, ultimately, there is no way to prove the picture is not of supernatural origin. \n \n \"When God changed the water to wine and made the fish and bread multiply, they seemed to be the same ordinary bread and wine,\" he said. \"Even though they were miraculous, they appeared similar to ordinary things.\" \n \n Guerrero said Vatican officials already have reviewed Garza-Valdes' book, and nothing has undermined the church's conviction about Juan Diego and the cloak bearing the image of the Virgin. \n \n \"There have been many attacks,\" he said. \"This is just one more.\"",
