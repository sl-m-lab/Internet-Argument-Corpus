If people argue that blacks need it to succeed, isn't that just another stereotype?\n\n \n Well said. \n \n Has anyone read \"Illiberal Education\" ? The author, who strikes me as a very fair minded person, noted that since AA came into Universities there has been an increase in racial incidents. He also says that black students' true abilities are often doubted by peers and faculty. It also seems to increase racial segregation and the view that blacks and whites are different. I can remember when it had never crossed my mind that blacks are \"special\". Yet nowadays, I have noticed that I am looking at these people differently. I am quite secure in my belief that there is no innate difference between a black and white person - if someone said that blacks are inferior I would dismiss them out of hand. Yet I think differently about black people. I seem to always think 'am I thinking racist thoughts' as soon as any colored person crosses my path. I believe that things like affirmative action and the constant vigilance against anything possibly racist is what causes this. In our school newspaper someone wrote a letter to the editor stating that the black \"licorice babies\" sold in a campus store were racist. To me, the message is that black people are vulnerable and fragile. We must protect them against anything that might be 'stigmatizing'. I don't believe it.\n \n Asian and Jewish individuals who perform so well seem to have a stronger family structure than anyone else. Black families are the weakest. I think that this is the biggest factor by far in the troubles of black America (and Native Canada). I've heard of a study that found that when familiy situation is accounted for, the apparant correlation between black skin and crime dissappears. This is good support for my theory that the real problem is weak family structure - not past rasicm, although that may also have some effect. \n \n The author of \"Illiberal Education\" said that a much better policy would be to consider family and economic background in admissions - a person who got a 1200 on the SAT who has a troubled and poor family probably has more potential than some one who went to a private school. This system would benefit all economically disadvantaged people, and any possible victims from historical racism would be included in that group as well.",

In other words, if blacks are smarter than the tests say, they will do much better in school or on the job than predicted by the IQ scores. The fact, however, is that the test scores predict just as accurately for blacks as whites how well they will do in college or at the workplace--they are just as valid for blacks as whites. This is called \"predictive validity\" and is a very important way of establishing whether you are measuring what you think you are measuring. This finding has led the National Academy of Sciences to conclude that IQ tests are not racially biased. By the way, the American Psychological Association has also issed a statement that IQ tests are not biased. \n \n As a matter of fact, IQ tests predict that blacks will do better than they actually do at college or at the workplace, implying that there are factors in addition to IQ that tend to produce lower black performance.\n \n If IQ tests are racially biased, why do IQ scores correlate very highly with reaction time tests? The test involves how quickly you react to lights going on and off on a board in front of you. People with high IQs tend to react more quickly than others, and it is thought that brains that process information very quickly and efficiently can also better handle complex sets of information. These tests show Asians to be the fastest reactors, whites next, an blacks third, in the same exact pattern as with IQ tests. Now explain how the speed of reacting to lights is culturally influenced. \n \n I'll look up specific references if you think I'm making this stuff up, but the HUNDREDS of studies with these kinds of findings are summarized in the books written by Berkeley psychometrician Arthur Jensen. \n \n \n\n Here is an excerpt from Harvard Educational Review\n \n Finally, and perhaps most seriously, educators charge that standardized tests are biased in terms of gender (National Center for Fair and Open Testing, 1992), race/ethnicity (Gardner, 1992; Willie, 1985), and social class (Haney, 1989).\n \n Well, well if some teachers think the test is biased, that proves it must be!

   "I think I'm safe in saying I struck a nerve. How does a person \"lose all credibility\" by stating a hypothesis and backing it up with well-established facts? I don't know anything and lack brain power? It's not a matter of whether I know anything; if the facts are consistent with the hypothesis, then the hypothesis is true. I fully expected someone to attack me since the facts can't be attacked because they are bullet-proof. I only speculate? I did nothing but state the facts in support of a hypothesis. Try next time to actually respond to my points by showing with specific, relevant evidence that blacks do not average lower IQs; that people in China do not average higher IQs; by showing that incomes in America are not consistent with patterns In IQ scores across ethnic groups. You will not be able to show these things.\n \n\n You are about to be killed by bullets through your bullet proof argument. Yeah you struck a nerve becaue basically you're saying races are not equal.By the way I'm not black. \n \n I hope next time you really think before posting your findings. \n \n \n\n I could give you dozens of websites that claim just the opposite, but the proper way to refute my facts is with specific contrary facts, not some websites somewhere that say something about IQ. \n\n I do have fact on those websites. All those sites talk about biases. I didn't want to put them all on here but I will to help you if you missed it.\n \n \n For both white students and students of color, success on the tests was positively correlated to how an individual had been tracked. Only 6.9 percent of students of color compared to 23 percent of white students had access to \"gifted and talented\" programs. This study suggests that tracking and the quality of the academic opportunities available in the school affects both the test score gap and the gap in academic performance generally. While these correlational studies are suggestive, they do not examine basic causes nor explain the pervasiveness and stability of the gap over prolonged periods of time...\n The researchers told half the students that the test did not assess ability, but that the research was aimed at \"understanding the psychological factors involved in solving verbal problems.\" The others were told that the test was a valid measure of academic ability and capacity. African-American students who were told that the test was a true measure of ability scored significantly lower than the white students. The other African-American students' scores were equal to the white students'. Whites performed the same in both situations. \n \n The explanation Steele offers is that Black students know they are especially likely to be seen as having limited ability. Groups not stereotyped in this way do not experience this extra intimidation. He suggests that \"it is serious intimidation, implying as it does that if they should perform badly, they may not belong in walks of life where their tested abilities are important - walks of life in which they are heavily invested.\" He labels this phenomenon \"stereotype vulnerability.\" ...\n \n Test scores do not predict future success in school, the university, or in the workplace. Some standardized tests, the SAT for example, do correlate statistically to future grades. But this correlation is short-lived. What standardized achievement tests appear to predict best are parents' wealth and scores on other similarly constructed tests. As reported by Peter Sacks, socio-economic class accounts for approximately 50 percent of the variance in SAT test scores. He estimates that for every additional $10,000 in family income, a person on average gains 30 points on the SAT. \n \n Though item bias remains, it is implausible to conclude that all the publishers in all their tests knowingly or unknowingly managed to create tests with an almost identical ratio of biased to unbiased items.\n \n http://www.rethinkingschools.org/ar...4/Race154.shtml\n \n Discriminatory Impact of Question Content More dangerous is the chance that MC questions are biased based on gender, culture, or income. Some questions that survive the editing process are \"worse than useless; they are, indeed, positively harmful.\"120 Consider this question: \"Who is the father of his country?\"\n \n While to some, the answer may be obvious, consider a different perspective. \"Is Washington right? George Washington? What about Gandhi, Ataturk, Moses, and Lenin?\"122 The response would depend upon a student's own heritage. Such a question is obviously culturally biased. Researchers have determined that in addition to the format, the content or subject matter of the questions can determine which gender is successful on a MC question. Studies have shown that students respond better to questions they find interesting, or that are set in familiar situations.123 While females generally have higher grades than their male peers, which gender scores higher on tests depends on the subject. 124 If the males are more interested in the question's subject, then they will be more successful.125 As a result, the subject matter of the question creates a silent bias.126 Some claim when MC tests, which are most often written by men, are used to preserve traditional positions of power by discriminating against women.127 Indeed, many more English and Reading ACT passages cover topics that are likely to be more familiar to whites and males than to minorities and to females.128 For example, of four publicly disclosed tests, men appeared in items five times more often than women, and when females are mentioned, they did not have the same status as males.129 One test featured 21 males, including famous scientists, politicians, and artists, but the five females included a 'she' and four characters in a passage of fiction.13\n \n http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/P...sle-gonzaga.pdf\n \n Now post all your finding beside the one study from Hennerstein and Murray. oh yeah nothing from pre- 1990.\n \n \n\n Here's a few more that you can attempt to refute:\n If IQ tests are racially biased because of cultural differences, why is the gap between the performance of blacks and whites larger on math portions of the test (the part that involves less culture) than the English portion of the test (the part that involves more culture). \n\n Sorry to inform you that is eaier to explain than you think. Considering that most minorities go to inferior schools. So what do tehy focus on? Vocational education so they don't do as much with math and sciences and they do need to communciate more so they use english mroe often. Math is used in more advanced education which most inner cities school don't focus.\n \n Thanks for being so simple minded in your assumptions.\n \n \n \n \n\n If IQ tests are racially biased, then they should underpredict how well blacks will do in college or on the job. In other words, if blacks are smarter than the tests say, they will do much better in school or on the job than predicted by the IQ scores. The fact, however, is that the test scores predict just as accurately for blacks as whites how well they will do in college or at the workplace--they are just as valid for blacks as whites. This is called \"predictive validity\" and is a very important way of establishing whether you are measuring what you think you are measuring. This finding has led the National Academy of Sciences to conclude that IQ tests are not racially biased. By the way, the American Psychological Association has also issed a statement that IQ tests are not biased. \n\n Oh are you referring to Hennerstein and Murray's test? Let me help you with that.\n \n Here directly form the apa journal.\n \n Undoubtedly, Herrnstein and Murray's arguments are wrong in some of the details, and they may be wrong about the larger picture. \n \n http://www.apa.org/journals/bell.html\n \n Here are some more to help you understand the study.\n \n In the fall of 1994, the book The Bell Curve by Herrnstein and Murray discussed the concept of intelligence, its measurement, and its relation to human behavior and political decisions. This book led to heated discussions in the press. When science and politics are mixed, scientific studies tend to be evaluated in relation to their political implications rather than their scientific merit. To help in the ongoing debate of issues raised by The Bell Curve, the American Psychological Association appointed a task force to provide an authoritative report on the present state of knowledge on intelligence.\n \n While the report was inspired by The Bell Curve, the authors make no attempt to analyze the arguments in this book. Rather they follow their charge: \"to prepare a dispassionate survey of the state of the art: to make clear what has been scientifically established, what is presently in dispute, and what is still unknown.\" \n \n http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/resource.html\n \n New York Leading psychologists have challenged both the research\n methods and the political agenda behind ``The Bell Curve,'' the best-\n selling book that claims genetic differences between blacks and whites\n contribute to lower IQ scores among African Americans.\n \n UCLA psychologist Halford Fairchild, who is leading one of four\n sessions devoted to the IQ controversy at the annual convention of the\n American Psychological Association, charged that ``the scientific\n basis of `The Bell Curve' is fraudulent.''\n \n In a series of papers to be presented this weekend, Fairchild and\n other experts will argue that the real motive of ``Bell Curve''\n authors Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray is supporting the\n political crusade against federal poverty programs and affirmative\n action.\n \n http://www.etext.org/Politics/Progressive.Sociologists/marthas-corner/Bell-Curve-Critiques.95\n \n This link below from the apa itself discounts the theory.\n \n The task force distinguishes sharply between scientific research and political rhetoric. 'The study of intelligence does not need politicized assertions and recriminations; it needs self-restraint, reflection, and a great deal more research.' According to the report, the questions that remain are socially as well as scientifically important and 'that there is no reason to think them unanswerable, but finding the answers will require a shared an sustained effort as well as the commitment of substantial scientific resources.' \n \n http://www.apa.org/releases/intell.html\n \n \n The Bell Curve by Murray and Herrnstein, a book whose invalid arguments Ceci had anticipated in the 1990 edition. Reports ingenious experimental research that undercuts the theory of a single general intelligence. Indeed, Ceci's work suggests that even Gardner's view of multiple intelligences goes too far in the \"lumper\" direction of assuming general cognitive domains. Two favorite quotations: \n \"[from the 1990 edition:] While none of the actual findings regarding the superiority of Terman's sample's income, health status, etc., that Butcher, Brody, Itzkoff, and many others find to be so impressive are wrong, the implications drawn from them are misleading. The fact is that if these 1,528 'geniuses' are compared to children from their same childhood social class instead of to economically unselected children, as Terman had originally done, they do not appear to be nearly as exceptional in their later professional or personal lives.\n \n http://learninfreedom.org/iqbooks.html\n \n \n Through I.Q. testing of immigrants, who often could not speak the language in which the test was given, and poorly- conducted mass testing of army recruits, Terman and his colleagues identified a number of populations they believed to be intellectually inferior, including people of southern and eastern European descent. Later in the century, Terman's hereditarian interpretation of I.Q. testing found an outspoken champion in Richard Herrnstein, co-author of The Bell Curve. In a highly controversial 1971 article in The Atlantic Monthly, Herrnstein (who died in 1994) began to focus the hereditarian argument on the I.Q. scores of African-Americans. It is this focus which Herrnstein and Murray develop in The Bell Curve: the \"dull\" people caught at the bottom of the social ladder in a web of \"socially undesirable behaviors\" are represented as disproportionately \"black.\" \n \n As evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould has pointed out, the Herrnstein-Murray argument in The Bell Curve rests on four assumptions: that \"intelligence\" is a unitary entity that can be measured by a number; that people can be ranked in linear order according to their numbers; that this numbering and ranking has a true genetic basis; and that nongenetic factors (environment, culture, nutrition, etc.) have no overall effect. \n \n What Murray and Herrnstein conveniently fail to mention is that their central assertion of a single general cognitive ability finds little professional support. Gould himself debunked its spurious statistical basis in his classic 1981 study, The Mismeasure of Man. Researchers such as Howard Gardner (Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences, 1993) have developed extensive evidence for an array of different kinds of intelligences which seem to function with remarkable independence from each other. \n \n The ranking of entire groups on the basis of \"general cognitive ability\" becomes even more bizarre when we consider how genetically mixed the world's peoples really are, with \"black,\" \"white,\" or \"Asian\" more akin to cultural or folk categories than biologically separate populations. As for The Bell Curve's assumption of a genetic basis of intelligence which is impervious to nongenetic factors, it is worth remembering that among the high I.Q. scorers in Murray and Herrnstein's new \"cognitive elite\" are the descendants of many of those same Eastern European immigrants deemed intellectually unfit by Terman's earlier intelligence test. \n \n Murray and Herrnstein's 845-page immersion in old-fashioned and highly-debatable assumptions from psychometrics and population genetics seems to have blinded them completely to the substantial contributions to our understanding of \"intelligence\" coming from the new field of cognitive neuroscience. This oversight is inexplicable at a time when the work of neurologists such as Antonio Damasio is yielding scientifically elegant and compelling data on the intricate development and variation of human brain systems. \n \n Damasio's discoveries about how and why different kinds of reasoning and competencies exist lend further evidence to the theories of independent \"multiple intelligences.\" Moreover, neuroscience's new understanding of the subtle and varied forces which shape the human brain and human behavior makes Murray and Herrnstein's claim to have resolved the \"nature vs. nurture\" debate about as nonsensical as it would be to hear a modern chemist announce that he has resolved the polarities of earth, air, fire and water: these long ago ceased to be meaningful ways to conceive of how nature works. \n \n http://www.autcom.org/think.html\n \n \n\n As a matter of fact, IQ tests predict that blacks will do better than they actually do at college or at the workplace, implying that there are factors in addition to IQ that tend to produce lower black performance.\n\n \n \n\n If IQ tests are racially biased, why do IQ scores correlate very highly with reaction time tests? The test involves how quickly you react to lights going on and off on a board in front of you. People with high IQs tend to react more quickly than others, and it is thought that brains that process information very quickly and efficiently can also better handle complex sets of information. These tests show Asians to be the fastest reactors, whites next, an blacks third, in the same exact pattern as with IQ tests. Now explain how the speed of reacting to lights is culturally influenced. \n \n I'll look up specific references if you think I'm making this stuff up, but the HUNDREDS of studies with these kinds of findings are summarized in the books written by Berkeley psychometrician Arthur Jensen. \n\n \n you're quoting a pre-civil rights movement study? Jensen who hasn't been able to publis his studies? You use the worst studies and depend on them too heavily. Especially since they are dependent on each other.\n \n Here is what your research would have revealed.\n \n A well-known black \"social scientist\" urged me not to do any such research. His stated reason was that it would \"dignify\" professor Arthur Jensen's thesis of a genetic basis for black-white differences in IQ scores. But my own suspicion was that he was afraid that the research would prove Jensen right.\n \n As it turned out, the research showed that the average IQ difference between black and white Americans -- 15 points -- was nothing unusual. Similar IQ differences could be found between various culturally isolated white communities and the general society, both in the United States and in Britain. Among various groups in India, mental test differences were slightly greater than those between blacks and whites in the United States.\n \n In recent years, research by professor James R. Flynn, an American expatriate living in New Zealand, has shaken up the whole IQ controversy by discovering what has been called \"the Flynn effect.\" In various countries around the world, people have been answering significantly more IQ test questions correctly than in the past.\n \n This important fact has been inadvertently concealed by the practice of changing the norms on IQ tests, so that the average number of correctly answered questions remains by definition an IQ of 100. Only by painstakingly going back and recalculating IQs, based on the initial norms, was professor Flynn able to discover that whole nations had, in effect, had their IQs rising over the decades by about 20 points\n \n Testing a taboo ; Black IQs actually have gone up; scoring methods hide it:[FINAL Edition] \n The Patriot - News. Harrisburg, Pa.: Oct 7, 2002. pg. A.08 \n \n \n This movement got a big boost in the 1960s, when arch-racist William Shockley (of \"genius sperm bank\" fame) got Berkeley professor Arthur Jensen working on his 1969 Harvard Educational Review article. Jensen suggested that Head Start had failed (!) because the kids were just born dumb and that black/white differences in average IQ scores reflected inherited racial differences in intelligence. This let loose a torrent of racist propaganda, including Richard Herrnstein's claim that unemployment might run in the genes. It also provoked a storm of anti-racist protest, including the organization of the International Committee Against Racism (InCAR). \n \n Princeton psychologist Leon Kamin showed convincingly that Jensen's whole argument depended on fraudulent \"data\" collected by Cyril Burt over a 40-year period. But meanwhile Jensen had inspired his student Thomas Bouchard to \"research\" the heritability of personality. In 1979, Bouchard began his \"Minnesota Twins\" study with a pair of separated identical twins named Jim, whose first and second wives had the same names, who both drove Chevys and who had given their dogs the same name (among other coincidences). Mass media publicity rounded up other pairs of separated twins who were eager to show off their identical tastes for particular brands of beer or cigarettes or their identical peculiar habits. \n \n http://www.plp.org/pamphlets/violinit.html\n \n In the 1970s, the Pioneer Fund underwrote research by William Shockley and Arthur Jensen, who set the next stage for the IQ and race issue. They proclaimed that blacks have lower IQs than whites. It is not surprising to note the resurgence once again of this idea in the publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 by conservative social scientist Charles Murray and the late Harvard Professor Richard Herrnstein. The book develops an argument that intelligence is largely hereditary. Since blacks score below whites on such tests, this leads the authors to draw conclusions in favor of, \"ending welfare to discourage births among low-IQ women, changing immigration laws to favor the capable and rolling back most job discrimination laws.\" \n \n It is bitterly ironic that this was published in the same year that the movie \"Forest Gump\" became a smash hit by showing the basic humanity and common sense wisdom of a low IQ white man. The Bell Curve has been reviewed by sociologist Christopher Jencks as \"highly selective in the evidence they present and in their interpretation of ambiguous statistics.\" And psychologist Richard Nisbett states that their work \"wouldn't be accepted by an academic journal--it's that bad.\" \n \n http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v09n2/immigran.html\n \n Another person whose advice Murray and Herrnstein \"benefitted especially from\"--and who shows up constantly in their footnotes--is Arthur Jensen, whose very similar claims about blacks having innately lower IQs were widely discredited in the 1970s. The Pioneer Fund has given more than $1 million to this \"giant in the profession,\" as Pioneer chief Weyher describes him (GQ, 11/94). And it's easy to see why: \"Eugenics isn't a crime,\" Jensen has said (Newsday, 11/9/94). \"Which is worse, to deprive someone of having a child, or to deprive the child of having a decent set of parents?\" \n \n http://www.fair.org/extra/9501/bell.html\n \n \n \n\n Well, well if some teachers think the test is biased, that proves it must be! Let's take a vote among teachers to see what the truth is!\n\n \n Teachers are educators.Educators are not necessarily teachers. Their are many educators that hold PHD's and reasearch this out but if you knew anything about studies and anything else you'd understand all this.\n \n \n\n This is exactly what I am saying!\n\n \n Yeah that support my arguments. Most minorites are in their position because of the failing of the US in the past.\n \n \n\n This is evidence that IQ is to some extent inherited; it is not evidence that the test is biased. \n\n Yeah if that were true. But the fact that your study is false and misleading.\n \n \n\n Then how does the average citizen of China, who makes an average of less than $1000 a year and has never even been to the U.S., score as high as the average white American?\n\n \n The fact that children in Japan and Taiwan learn much more math than their peers in America, for example, can be attributed primarily to differences in culture and schooling rather than in abilities measured by intelligence tests.\n http://home.comcast.net/~neoeugenics/apa.htm\n \n \n \n\n Then why does the average citizen in Japan or the average citizen of South Korea score 6 points higher on IQ tests than the average white American when the tests were designed by white Americans? \n\n \n THe emphasis in Asian countries are different than in America. They focus on math and science while here in the US we focus on well rounded education. Also Asian countries generally weed out the weaker students and don't let them continue in schools skewing the results even more. Also math and science generally isn't as bias.\n \n \n \n\n Here I am quoting all this research that shows that Asians are smarter than whites. Does this offend me as a white person? Of course not. Do I attack the person listing these facts studies? Of course not. I freely accept these facts because they are facts and don't worry that they make the race I happen to belong to look not so smart. Would I be offended if we were discussing why so many professional basketball players or sprinters were black, and someone responded that it was because blacks tended to be taller, faster, and more coordinated than whites? Of course I wouldn't be offended; I believe it's true, and that belief doesn't hurt or bother me at all. I feel good enough about myself that some unflattering facts about my race are not going to make any difference to me. \n\n \n Of course not because someone as smart as you can be happy to be the second smartest race. it makes you feel so good especially since you did little than research one study in the last decade tha supports your position.\n \n Also Blacks are more focused on fewer sports. There are more blacks percentage wise playing major sports. Whites are spread across many mroe sports wiht fewer playing. Also the importance of sports is placed more heavily in Black cultures than whites. White generally regard sports with less esteem than blacks. Thanks for continuing to lose credibility and show that ignorace lives in america and is behind racism.\n \n Anyways have fun at your clan rally.",

The supply of highly technical professionals IS limited by cognitive ability. Top colleges require high SAT/ACT test scores (unless you're a minority) in order to get your Bachelor's degree. Going on to a good Med School or a top Grad School requires top GRE scores (unless you're a minority). The fact that not everyone can attain high SAT/ACT/GRE scores coupled with high grades as an undergrad program limits the talent pool to the \"cognitive elite\" (unless you're a minority, that is). Do you see a pattern forming?\n \n\n Anyways try reading somehting that is legit to help you understand what really affects the world.\n\n \n Are you saying that Dr. Thomas Sowell isn't a letitimate author? Here's a little bio on Sowell for you:\n Born in North Carolina, raised in Harlem. After graduating magna cum laude from Harvard University (1958), he went on to receive his master's in economics from Columbia University (1959) and a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago (1968).\n Professor at Cornell University, Rutgers University, Amherst University, Brandeis University and the University of California at Los Angeles.\n He has authored a dozen books and contributes to many newspapers.\n Currently, he's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institute.\n I'd say that he's a \"legit\" source. ...Oh, BTW, he's also a self-made black man.",

The major groups he identifies are Caucasian, sub-Saharan African, Northeast Asian, Southeast Asian, and American Indian (they are a few other very small groups). Middle Eastern and many East Indians are Caucasian. He then maps how far the genes of each group are apart from each other. The most distance is found between sub-Saharan Africans and all others. Europeans are very closely related to Middle Eastern and many East Indian people. The surprising finding is that Northeast Asians are more similar to American Indians than they are to Southeast Asians (because the latter has received a lot of indigenous Australian genes).\n \n These racial patterns are very consistent with other evidence on the movement of human evolution: the first big separation was the exit from Africa, then you have a European/Asian split, and then an Asian/American Indian split. \n \n Another type of proof of the genetic reality of race is there exist organizations now that can take a sample of your DNA and can tell you what your racial genetic history is (e.g. 85% black, 15% white). Also, forensic anthropologists can very accurately tell you the race of human skeletal remains. \n \n On the issue of IQ, my argument of racial differences ignores the question of the cause of those differences, whether it be environmental, genetic, or some combination. If it is true, as it may be, that the difference is purely environmental, it doesn't change my point at all. Advocates of racial preference programs argue that minority groups lag behind other groups because whites have held them down. Whites are to blame and consequently, it is their obligation to fix the problem. I am arguing that the cause of the lag is differences in cognitive abilities, a problem which whites did not inflict on minorities, so it is not their obligation to fix the problem. We can discuss if people want what the evidence is for why we see cognitive differences, but my argument does not depend on the cause.\n \n As for what to do about the IQ gap, there simply is no easy solution. We have attempted to equalize environments at least since the anti-segregation movement, and while black IQs have risen, so have white's, so the 15 point IQ gap has not narrowed in the past 100 years. One practical idea I read the other day is that research has shown that breastfeeding a baby tends to raise his/her IQ, and black mothers breastfeed at substantially lower rates than white mothers. This is an example of a non-genetic, biological approach to the problem--a refreshing new approach after decades and decades of failed \"fix the envirnonment\" approaches.",

   "from Man'ia: \"Test scores do not predict future success in school, the university, or in the workplace. Some standardized tests, the SAT for example, do correlate statistically to future grades. But this correlation is short-lived.\" \n Are they kidding? Does this seem common sensical to you that people who scores high on tests like SATs are NO more likely to do perform well in college than those with low scores? This is mistaken anyway; even the large, liberal UC studies found that SATs predict college grades about as well as high school grades do. So do you want to argue that high school grades are invalid too? Neither one is an especially powerful predictor because of what is called \"restriction of range.\" Prospective college students tend to all be fairly smart, so it is difficult to predict which of these similar people will emerge as the best college students. There are other factors--maturity, drive, and organizational skills--that explain college success in addition to intelligence. But the correlations indicating predictive validity of IQ are still there.\n \n And anyway SATs are not proper IQ tests. Jensen in Straight Talk about Mental Testing lists the research findings of the correlation between IQ and freshman grades as .44; GPA .40; grades in law school .30; an highest level of education by age 40 around .55. These correlations are impressive for individual-level research. \n \n I spoke of job success as well. Hunter and Hunter (1984) found that IQ predicts job performance much more effectively than ANY other predictor, including: biographical data, reference checks, education, interview, job interest, or age. The correlation was .53; I'm lucky in my individual-level research to find correlations of .30. \n \n The largest study ever done on the subject (more than 600,000 students) by James Coleman in the 60s found that IQ tests overpredict the academic performance of blacks; it's unexpected, but he found a bias in theirfavor. \n \n \"What standardized achievement tests appear to predict best are parents' wealth and scores on other similarly constructed tests. As reported by Peter Sacks, socio-economic class accounts for approximately 50 percent of the variance in SAT test scores. He estimates that for every additional $10,000 in family income, a person on average gains 30 points on the SAT.\" \n \n How can a measure predict something that happened in the PAST, namely one's parents' wealth? What they are trying to say is that parental wealth explains the child's scores. These people ignore the copious research agreed on by most psychometricians that IQ on an individual level is around 60% inherited. That finding is so solid, even in the liberal discilpine of psychology it is reported in introductory textbooks. If you control for the parent's IQ, the correlation between parents' wealth and the child's IQ drops tremendously.",

   "Good post. Race shows time and time again to have enough between-group variance to be useful. For example, if I wanted to learn about the patterns of height, I would find that dividing my sample into blacks, whites, and Asians would be very useful. The fact that there is within-group variation, or that not all blacks are the tallest or all Asians the shortest does not prevent my categorization from being useful or meaningful. Such a classification would help me a great deal if I were trying to explain why 12.3% of Americans are black, but more than one-half of all NBA players are. Or race would be a useful classification if I were trying to trying to find risk factors for sickle-cell anemia.\n\n \n Fair enough, but how do you determine which 'racial category' a person belongs to in your hypothetical study?\n \n Is it through genetic screening of all participants or is it a self report of 'racial or ethnic' affiliation? \n \n Utilizing a self-report of racial or ethnic automatically excludes the precision grouping that genetic variance would allow for. Instead you are relying on a social construct to determine one's racial composition that may or may not accurately reflect their 'true' genetic heritage.\n \n This is problematic for several reasons, first of all Caville-Stronka's work is not based on this socially constructed racial or ethnic affiliation. Indeed he seems to argue that these types of construction is not valid. This excludes his work as a meaningful source to draw upon. \n \n Perhaps more importantly, if racial identification is indeed largely a social construct it stands to reason that the negative outcomes associated with being a member of a particular racial category would be in no small part influenced by social factors. Socially constructed racial affiliation is associated with significantly lower IQ scores; thus we would be hard pressed to say there is some sort of genetic component to this difference.\n \n Furthermore, since there hasn't been a study to date that has scientifically examined the genetic 'Blackness' of African-Americans I don't think we can convincingly argue that there is some genetic component to IQ test scores.\n \n Whistler",

   "There is a great book called Germs, Guns, and Steel that addresses the reasons why European whites (Western Civilization) are so dominant in the world today. (I lent the book to a friend, so I don't know the author or publisher.)\n \n The author's concludes that race was not a factor. In summary; the first civilizations began where there were domesticatable plants and later, animals. In Africa (the source of the human race), there are NO domesticatable animals except the dog. Also, besides a single type of bean, there were no easily domesticatable food plants. In the middle east; however, there were grains and animals that were domesticated and used to provide a surplus of food, which resulted in the creation of a society that allowed for specialists (carpenters, artists, scientists, ect.). \n \n Then you have the advent of cities in Europe that resulted in severe diseases due to poor sanitation and close proximity. European whites developed resistance to these diseases (like small pox). European food surpluses allowed advancement in techknowlogies (sp?) such as the invention of steel, guns, and the ability to travel over huge distances.\n \n When whites came to the Americas, the natives had no resistance to the germs, no steel (or horses, wheels, or written language), and obviously, no guns. White Europeans saw their easy conquest of the 'New World' as God's will. \n \n My point?

There is wide consensus among psychometricians that genes explain around 60-70% of why some whites are smarter than other whites or why some blacks are smarter than other blacks. While there is much indirect evidence, the jury is still out on how much of the racial  gap is genetic and how much is environmental. \n \n As I wrote before (did you read it?) it is not only Jensen or Murray who find the results; a survey of hundreds of leading psychometricians agree that IQ tests are unbiased, and that IQ is largely inherited at an individual level. A substantial percentage also believe that genes play some role in the racial gap, although fear of repercussions prevents them from saying this in public. \n \n To a large extent, the researchers critical of IQ are either propogandists like Gould or Lewontin who are not even psychologists, or are from the discipline of sociology--a discipline which dismisses the role of genes in basically all behavior without even investigating the issue (I should know, I have a PhD in sociology and am a total renegade in my views). \n \n \n \n\n When I referred to Asians I was referring to all asians (Indians, Arabs, Koreans, vietnamese, etc)\n Also either way you proved my point. If Chines in the US do better than Chinese in in China then it goes to rpove it's not genetic. That it's teh education, culture, and every opther difference that affects learning.\n \n\n High IQs are characterstic of Northeast Asians moreso than Southeast Asians, and you assume that these countries have IQs only because of culture. This may be true, but where is your evidence? It could just as easily be the case that smart people create education-oriented cultures as the idea that education-oriented cultures create intelligence. How does a society ever get an education-oriented culture in the first place?\n \n I didn't know you were even trying to argue that environment causes IQ--I thought your point was that IQ as measured is a bogus concept. You make it sound like I have been arguing against the view that the environment causes racial IQ gaps--I have done no such thing. You are right, this is evidence for the role of environment, but the Chinese evidence is not very impressive in my estimation. One problem is that studies show that immigrants have average IQ 10 points higher than people not leaving home, so this could be what you call a \"selection effect.\" Also, the environment in China is VERY far from the American environment, yet Chinese only gain somewhere between 5 and 10 points by moving to an American environment. The gap between Chinese environment and American is MUCH larger than the American black-white environment gap, implying that enhancing black environments may only have a small impact on black IQs.",
