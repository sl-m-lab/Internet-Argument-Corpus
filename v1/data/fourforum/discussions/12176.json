   "Since God is brought into the controversy of homosexuality let's look at it this way. This means the Bible becomes the guide as to whether or not God approves of homosexuals. And most of us know that God really hates homosexuals. \n \n Leviticus 18:22 I shall not lie with mankind as with womankind as it is abomination. A man having sexual connections with other men is morally disgusting in God's eyes.\n \n Let's look at this just a little further to determine what is actually homophobic.\n \n The Bible contains approximately 1,000,000 versus. It is used by countless people around the world, including the Catholic Church, to declare that homosexuality is bad. \n \n How many verses in the Bible actually deal with homosexuality? Six! Six verses out of 1 million deal with homosexuality.\n \n Deuteronomy 22. If a bride is found not to be a virgin she is to be stoned to death.\n \n Deuteronomy 22 again. If a man commits adultery with a man and a woman shall be executed.\n \n Leviticus. If a couple has sex during her period they shall both be killed.\n \n Genesis. If you spill your seed onto the ground you can be killed.\n Apparently if we follow the Bible to its exact meaning and references we cannot have sex with virgins because if you do without being married to them they shall be stoned. You can't get divorced, you can't have adulterous relationships you can't wear certain types of fabric and the most terrible one of all you can't masturbate and shed your seed on the ground.\n \n The Catholic Church's arguments about these particular passages is that they are passages from the past and we should interpret them in a new meaning today. The world has changed. We know that we should change some passages for our own world today. So, why don't we do that about homosexuality? In the end, who really cares about who is having sex with whom?\n \n This is to all homophobes. If you want to follow the Bible and if you believe in all honesty that it says that you should hate homosexuals allow me to express one point. When Jesus was asked by one young man about what the greatest commandment was He said this, \"to love God with all your heart and soul, mind and strength.\" Secondly, \"to love your neighbor as yourself\". So Jesus Christ apparently said to love your neighbor as you love yourself. So that means to you who say homosexuals should die, enjoy shooting yourself in the head because scripturally, if that's what you want to do you should do it yourself first. If you believe in the Bible or not, we all do things which are bad. And if you do believe in the Bible take that very famous quote, \"let thee without sin cast the first stone. \n \n Now, let's conscentrate on the other 999,994 verses, shall we?",
