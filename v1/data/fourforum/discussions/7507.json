   "Sorry, the fact they are human beings and want to marry isn't a good enough reason to change marriage in my book. There are other examples out there of human beings wanting to marry that I don't particularly think is good either--there are male human beings in Utah that probably would love to marry 10 or 11 wives. Human beings. Wanting to marry. I could name other examples of human beings probably wanting to marry, that would no doubt elicit the usual scripted and automatic talking-point \"offensive!\" shouts from people in your movement. I won't, but you get the point, I'm sure.\n\n \n You implied that allowing same-sex marriages would open the flood gates to terrible things. I was attempting to focus the topic on the relevant issue. Not some flight of fancy into polygamy, etc. which is entirely different. And yes, I am not being overly sensitive when you call me getting married a circus. That is insulting. And cut out the \"your movement\" garbage. \n \n \n \n \n Well gee, by all means, since marriage wasn't at one time based on traditional ideas of commitment to ONE person, instead being a way for men to have women as property, let's use THAT to justify changing it now!! The fact something has gone through changes in the past is in no way any valid reason to assume it should be changed now.\n\n You were the one who said marriage is \"solid and unchanging\". I was merely demonstrating that you were wrong. Cultural institutions change all the time when they no longer serve the culture. That is a fact. \n \n And lose the snotty, condescending attitude.",

   "No, because the issue isn't gays OR heterosexuals. It's not the people involved. It's how we define marriage. Marriage is currently defined as something definitively opposite-sex--something that is at the heart of what marriage is. If it's not opposite-sex, it's not marriage. It may be something, but it's not marriage. And I don't support redefining marriage.\n\n \n Yes, you support the definition that includes only different-sex couples, and excludes same-sex couples.

For Jyoshu the word marriage for him, as well as many conservatives, is the Ward and June of leave it to beaver model. Jyoshu is just hung up on a word. He is all for civil unions, even though they would be the equalivant of marriage. He can see the middle ground to a point. He just isn't looking at the issue as you or I would as gay people. We see the unfairness and inequality of civil unions as being segragation and the term \"seperate but equal\" being apllied to us. The other conservatives on this board don't even want gay people to exsist they want us to hide in our closets or better yet, from their prespective, become heterosexual.",

I do talk to conservate people all the time and there views are exactly as I have stated them. The whole aim with ANYconservative who supports heterosexual only marriage is to keep gays out of marriage. If you ask them why can't two men get married to each other they state 100% of the time that THEYbelieve that marriage is between a man and a woman. The sole purpose in all these marriage amendments accross the country and the world is to keep gay people out of marriage. Ask any conservative and I bet this is the answer you will get. If this statemnet isn't true then there ishould be no problem with two men or two women getting a marriage license. If my statement is false then why all the fuss and what exactly are the conservatives tring to protect marriage from? If not from gay people?",

The whole aim with ANYconservative who supports heterosexual only marriage is to keep gays out of marriage.\n\n \n But you went farther than that--you said conservatives prefer the word marriage to be the Ward and June Cleaver model. You know good and well that entails a lot more than just the issue of whether gays should marry. There are a lot of things about that \"model\" (as vague as your examnple is) that conservatives don't necessarily champion. I seriously doubt you simply meant that conservatives perfer marriage to be opposite-sex when you made that statement, because saying that conjures up many other ideas as well such as patriarchal families, stay-at-home mothers, etc. There's no broad consensus among conservatives about those things at all.",
