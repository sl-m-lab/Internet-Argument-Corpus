   "This is taken from the NRSV Bible. It makes more sence than that danged KJV Bible which I refuse to use. This is from Exodus Chapter 20 starting with the first commandment on verse 2.\n List ordered by commandment:\n \n Exodus 20: 2-3\n \n1. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me.\n\n Exodus 20: 4-6\n \n2. You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me, but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.\n\n Exodus 20: 7\n \n3.You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.\n\n Exodus 20: 8-11\n \n4. Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work. But the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God; you shall not do any work-you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and consecrated it.\n\n Exodus 20: 12\n \n5. Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.\n\n Exodus 20: 13\n \n6. You shall not murder.\n\n Exodus 20: 14\n \n7. You shall not commit adultery.\n\n Exodus 20: 15\n \n8. You shall not steal.\n\n Exodus 20: 16\n \n9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.\n\n Exodus 20: 17\n \n10. You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\n\n \n \n So it's commandment 5.\n \n Does this help any?",

Other locations are also identified in the Pentateuch by names that were invented long after the death of Moses. \n \n Numbers 12:3: This verse states \"Now the man Moses was very humble, more than all men who were on the face of the earth.\" (NKJ) If Moses were that humble, it is unlikely that he would have described himself in these glowing terms.\n \n Deuteronomy 34:5-9: These verses describe the death, burial, age at death, physical condition at death, and morning period for Moses. It is difficult for an individual to describe events at and after his or her death. Some have suggested that this portion of the Pentateuch (and only this portion) was written later by Joshua. However, R.E. Friedman wrote: \"...in the sixteenth century, Carlstadt, a contemporary of Luther, commented that the account of Moses' death is written in the same style as texts that precede it. This makes it difficult to claim that Joshua or anyone else merely added a few lines to an otherwise Mosaic manuscript.\" \n \n Deuteronomy 34:10: This states \"There has never been another prophet like Moses...\" (NLT) This sounds like a passage written long after Moses' death.

Some say there is a Creator and some say there is no creator (Trebor has conveniently refused to say which he believes). There is no official recognition of an afterlife, or even a Jewish Messiah. If there is an afterlife, it's based on rewarding works - believing in God is not even necessary. This is somewhat humerous since who is it that's supposedly going to reward those works if God doesn't exist?. As noted in their beliefs, \"Most believe God is forgiving of all.\" One has to wonder then if Reform Jews will feel at ease in eternity with Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin and other serial murderers running loose in their midst? In addition, rather than embrace traditional Judaism which teaches that Homosexual relations are a sin, many Reform Jews openly endorse gay sex, saying such behavior is God-created! What's more, reincarnation is in too if they want, which is a documented pagan belief contrary to reason and tradition. But such is Trebor's \"anything goes\" theology!",
