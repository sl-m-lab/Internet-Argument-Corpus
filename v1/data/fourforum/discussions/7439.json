   "I was reading a statement on a media website, the possibility of military force is on the table. Along with the other options Europe and the Unites States has in choice.\n But, if we went to war with Iran:\n 1. We would lose more forces than we did in Iraq cause Iran has a better military and infrastructure than Iraq.\n 2. Pakistan threatened to use nuclear warheads on any country that attacks or invades Iran. This could result in nuclear war. \n 3. Right now Germany, france, The United Kingdom, and Amerika are having international crisis. They have tried to talk the Iranians into abolishment of nuclear arms/research. If it came to military action, would they all fight with us? We all know France won't. They refused to help with Iraq. In fact, France was an ally of Iraq. Supplying military hardware. Russia too.\n 4. This really would spread more hatred against Amerika in the Middle East.\n Most if not all hate Amerikans now because we invaded two arabic countries already. Plus the whole support of Israel is also ####### the arabs off.\n 5. Would this turn into a nuclear war? Bill O'reilly says another world war is in the midst. We all know that many of the European countries would probably fight with us. Atleast the ones with us on the whole Iranian dispute. I am sure some arabic countries would get involved. Russia and China might get involved.\n Right now, I am not sure. Amerika is surely pising off the world. Arabs hate us now because of the whole Iraq war, Russia and China have mixed feelings for us, North Korea is slowly but surely falling apart with sanctions, South Korea is slowly beginning to opose the way we are handling the North, and in our own country, we have anti-war and anti-Bush people opposed to the way our government is handling Iraq.\n I think Amerika is beginning to lose allies. Saudi Arabia kicked us out of our bases, I beleive that was the result of Amerika going to war with Saudi Arabia. I don't know. All I know is, we are becoming hated and hated every day. Scary.\n -John Hetrev Milosevic",

   "\n 1. We would lose more forces than we did in Iraq cause Iran has a better military and infrastructure than Iraq.\n \n\n I agree with you on that. However, most likely there infrastructure isn't exactly the best. I can say though if we attack them than they will retaliate and they would be united unlike Iraq and we would lose a lot more troops than we did or ever will in Iraq. If we decided to just go in and blow up some places than no we would not lose that many soldiers.\n \n\n 2. Pakistan threatened to use nuclear warheads on any country that attacks or invades Iran. This could result in nuclear war.\n \n\n Pakistan is more worried about India. It is however possible they would declare war on us, but if they used nuclear weapons they would just turn everyone against them.\n \n\n 3. Right now Germany, france, The United Kingdom, and Amerika are having international crisis. They have tried to talk the Iranians into abolishment of nuclear arms/research. If it came to military action, would they all fight with us? We all know France won't. They refused to help with Iraq. In fact, France was an ally of Iraq. Supplying military hardware. Russia too.\n \n\n I don't see any country helping us except maybe Britain. Unless something tramatic happened such as the use of nuclear weapons on another nation. Than everyone on the UN would be gun ho on Iran.\n \n\n 4. This really would spread more hatred against Amerika in the Middle East.\n Most if not all hate Amerikans now because we invaded two arabic countries already. Plus the whole support of Israel is also ####### the arabs off.\n \n\n I would think it would make them mad. But, Iraqi people are mainly happy with us throwing out Saddam. Most likely there would be harsh diplomatic ties with most of the middle east and maybe an oil embargo.\n \n\n 5. Would this turn into a nuclear war? Bill O'reilly says another world war is in the midst. We all know that many of the European countries would probably fight with us. Atleast the ones with us on the whole Iranian dispute. I am sure some arabic countries would get involved. Russia and China might get involved.\n \n\n I don't think China or Russia would get involved. Maybe some other middle eastern nations. Europe I'm unsure on. Unless Iran specificaly says \"We will use are nuclear factories for whatever we wish, including selling them to other nations\" Iran has more freedoms than Iraq had under Saddam. There people are ralatively happy and enjoy some western customs such as parties. (However, those parties are illegal and people sometimes are thrown in prison because of it) I believe if we attacked Iran we would not be greeted as anything but invaders. I think this can be handled diplomaticly or via covert operations.\n \n\n Right now, I am not sure. Amerika is surely pising off the world. Arabs hate us now because of the whole Iraq war, Russia and China have mixed feelings for us, North Korea is slowly but surely falling apart with sanctions, South Korea is slowly beginning to opose the way we are handling the North, and in our own country, we have anti-war and anti-Bush people opposed to the way our government is handling Iraq.\n \n\n I don't think Arabs hate us about the whole Iraq war. Maybe the terroist and other dictators, but not every Arab. And those anti-war and anti-Bush don't like the way we handle Iraq? Oh well...when they figure out something besides pulling forces out than sure offer suggestions. Right now I think North Korea will be handled by the US thorugh China and I don't think South Korea is exactly opposing us. I think there just worried of another Korean War.\n \n\n I think Amerika is beginning to lose allies. Saudi Arabia kicked us out of our bases, I beleive that was the result of Amerika going to war with Saudi Arabia. I don't know. All I know is, we are becoming hated and hated every day. Scary.\n -John Hetrev Milosevic\n\n I don't think we will lose allies. And Saudi Arabia kicked us out? I didn't hear of that! emoticon_wow I don't think we ever went to war with Saudi Arabia. Also are nation has always been hated, now there just mad cause were going around doing stuff. I can understand that are allies might distance themselves and not support us in Iran or North Korea. However, I don't think we will be going to war with either of them unless again something highly tramatic happens. Even if Bush said \"All the options are on the table\" that was more of a political move. I highly doubt we will be going to war soon again. However, note the above \"unless something tramatic happens\" Hope that helps! emoticon_xgood \n \n I do think however that Africa is more in trouble than the middle east. We should be focusing down there. Maybe look for allies in the Middle East (Besides Israel) for help in making Africa a more free continent.\n \n Aww Politics. Why not have every nation's leader get together and have a nice drink. emoticon_xhoho",
