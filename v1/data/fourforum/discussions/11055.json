   "This article by the baptist standard supports what I experienced in Texas when I lived there in the 80s. I found this closing statement in the article to be most telling.\n \n \nTheir success is aided by their \"experimental and expressive kinds of worship styles,\" and the lack of a label that may link them to a particular race, such as white with Southern Baptist or black with Church of God in Christ.\n ___\"What comes along with a denominational identity ... is a whole set of baggage, including racial baggage,\" Thumma said.\n\n \n I think this is the crux of the identity issue that all Church's experience. Racial baggage limits peoples ability to interact on a spiritual level. It takes practice and an act of the will to get beyond those old prejudices and fears. I know that my church is inter-racial to a higher percentage than the rest of the community. Black members have told black friends about us so we have a very healthy and diverse membership, including Asian believers also. And remember that I too am a minority as an Arab American of Middle Eastern descent.\n \n The percentages given in that article are shocking to me given that it mentions all denominations in its results. But I'm not here to make excuses for these shortcomings in the Christian Church. If the numbers are accurate, then they are appalling. I shared how I reacted back in the 80s when i attended a segregated church. My membership there was short lived. \n \n But neither can I, or any one person single handedly change a system of institutional segregation. All I can do is speak loudly and clearly that I won't accept it or support it in my community. And I have always done that in my christian walk. I have made clear that I know that God is color blind, and that He loves us all equally, no matter what our Race or Sexual Proclivity. All we must do is receive His free gift of salvation in order to be saved. After that, our life's walk is between us and God as a child walks with his Father and learns from Him how to be a responsible and righteous citizen.",

I think people tend to form groups and 'hang out' with people with which they culturally have things in common. It needs to be kept in mind that churches (particularly in rural areas) are often centers of activity and social life for people. And in many cases, even having nothing to do with church life, a lot of white people have more white friends than black friends. Conversely, I notice the same happens with black people a lot of times. That's simply not necessarily a sign of racism per se; rather simply that people tend to want to form relationships with people with which they have a more common culture. The fact is, many \"black churches\" have very different worship traditions than \"white ones\", and vice versa.\n \n That's not to say, of course, that people shouldn't be encouraged to step outside their comfort zones. I'd LOVE to see more mainline churches be more racially diverse. It's a very difficult thing to do though, because often they have very different traditions and worship styles. To chalk that up to racism is a gross over-simplification. That tendency to congregate with people of similar culture and beliefs is the nature of protestantism--churches sometimes form out of protest against something, and therefore it's membership tend to be like-minded in a cultural and ideological sense. But this phenomenon is certainly not limited to issues of race. Dividing lines between denominations happen over many issues, including financial differences, theological differences, and geographical differences.\n \n However, historically, racism has certainly played a role in the history of Christianity in the U.S. The Southern Baptist Convention (which ironically is the largest protestant denomination in the U.S.) was effectively FORMED out of overt racism because they supported slavery and split off from groups that sided with abolitionism. In 1995, the SBC officially renounced those roots and apologized for it's past defense of slavery. Interestingly, this happened during a convention where there was a conservative take-over of the convention going on, and had NOT taken place under more liberal leaderships in the SBC. Similar schisms also took place among the Methodist denominations, such as the United Methodist Church, from which AME Church, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and Christian Methodist Episcopal Church all split off because of the racism going on in the United Methodist Church. Today, the UMC too has renounced it's past on this matter, and apologized.\n \n I think it is important to judge religious groups by what they do now as opposed by what they did decades and even centuries ago. Sure, some churches are still probably racist and would not welcome someone who didn't look like them into their midst. But I think that mindset is getting rare--certainly more rare--in mainline denominations. However, the non-integration often remains because the cultures of these churches are often radically different. This change simply mirrors what is going on society around it: racism is getting more rare in society at large than it was decades ago, so naturally it's going to become more and more that way in churches too.\n \n To explore this further, it could be argued that this phenomenon of non-integration has been useful at times and served good purposes. Black churches were hugely instrumental as a unifying factor during the civil rights movement--and without that identity as 'black churches', that influence and factor may not have been as strong. And while certainly less important than influence on civil rights, the influence of the tradition of black churches has had a significant impact on the arts particularly in the area of music. This may not have been such the case without a strong 'black-only' tradition of a worship style.\n \n One other thought--some denominations have come about (or at least evolved) largely for the sole purpose of integration-type priorities like promoting and practicing diversity. The Unitarian Universalists are one such group, of which our own fellow poster, Ohioprof is a member.",

   "I've been to many different styles of Churches...including all black ones.\n \n In my experiences and observations, there are different styles that appeal to certain cultural groupings. And those groupings are typically based on race.\n \n I haven't visitied any of the Asian (Korean or Vietnamese for example) churches yet but the standard should also hold as they are draped with their native language on the outside.\n \n In visiting black churches, I have found a lot of acceptance of my white self and son. With him integrating and playing freely with the kids there.\n \n To their credit, (and while I'll blast them on beliefs and practices) charismatic, pentacostalish churches are the MOST integrated I've seen.\n Their origins are based on integration and they have championed the cause of equality quite often.\n Like Rock and Roll if you will.\n \n I have witnessed blacks in Catholic services and in their church run schools too with little problems yet. they\n Churches will be as diverse as the communities they are a part of. With black dominated areas of a community having black dominated churches (regardless of denomination) and visa versa for other racial groupings.\n The same happened with schools too if you recall. Thus, the government intervention of desegregation with bussing mandates to ensure equality.\n Churches have no such program, but being an elective activity, you are free to go where you desire.

And more often than not, other factors play a role.\n If your a casual believer, chances are you'll just go to what's local and save time and money on transportation.\n If you're devoted or found a place you like, you'll spend more time and devote more resources to getting there.\n \n The end question would be, how well recepted are you if you go to a church that has a dominant race other than your own?\n Other than fringe groups, I've found that most churches don't really care.\n \n The worst discrimination I've seen is one based on the color of your money.
