   "Mike Huckabee took a modest lead of 0.2% in the Ref's Poll Averages on Sunday. Obama took the lead from Hillary as well by a slightly larger margin of 0.6%. A lead change in an individual poll does not necessarily signify a shift in the race because of variables that impact individual polls. When a lead change occurs in a reliable poll average, a major shift is generally occurring because averages are not as vulnerable to the variables that cause great shifts in individual polls. \n \n We will see whether the lead changes hold up, but even if they do not both Romney and Clinton are in trouble in Iowa. Clinton can withstand a loss in Iowa but if Obama wins Iowa and Democrats begin to question Hillary's electability and competence, she could be in trouble. Romney probably cannot withstand a loss in Iowa considering how much he has spent and the high expectations for him in the state. Huckabee's biggest Iowa fan is Giuliani. If Huckabee upsets Romney in Iowa the Romney strategy will likely derail. \n \n One positive exists for Romney in this shift, however, in that it downgrades the expectations of Romney in Iowa. If he wins by a small margin the claim that he underperformed will not carry as much sting. Obama and Huckabee each scored big on Sunday.",

   "What if Huckabee ends up coming in second in Iowa or barely wins? One latest poll had him ahead of close to 20 points but how accurate can that be? I think Romney needs to come in at least 3rd and probably 2nd to keep a good chance of winning New Hampshire. I think Guilani is really in trouble and could lose all momentum by super Tuesday. If Huckabee wins he'll be getting a lot of press attention (as he is now just by leading Iowa polls) and the NH winner will also get a significant boost. The attention will shift from Guilani and could easily push Huckabee or Romney ahead. It will be interesting to see but Huckabee has proven himself as running an effective campaign with little money. I think he could very well win the nomination but could be dangerous in the general election because of his social stances. \n \n I'm not saying I endorse these candidates it interesting to look at the race (whether you're a republican or democrat) and see how it develops.",
