   "I was online tonight looking at recent world events and saw that US and Japanese government officials say that the Taepdong-2 long range missle was actually aimed at Hawaii. Dunno if diplomacy will work on Kim if this is how he will answer. If you ask me we've waited too long on being firm with Korea. Iraq,Iran and other events has drawn our attention away from them, and as a result, Kim draws our attention once again, with his weapons program. And of course God forbid if we did take military action, China would be against it every step of the way due to the litterally tens of thousands of refugees fleeing from the chaos and the poverty stricken nation. Something has to be done, but the question is military action the only true resort we have left with this madman?",

They have to know that doing so would be the end of their country, as we could drop enough nukes on them to turn NK into a glass parking lot. I see it more as Kim et al. simply rattling a sabre to try to make some economic gains in the world market. NK is like a small child tugging at mom's shirt tail trying to get attention. Since we are so focused on Afganistan, Iraq, and Iran right now, they figure that they can shoot off a few missiles and scare us into giving them something to appease them. I think the best policy would be to keep an eye on them, but in general ignore them.",

Korea's missile development to sell a major joint US/Japan missile defense program to Japan to gobble more tax money, make a GDP contribution based on debt and keep defense contractor political bribes flowing. That's a major reason for all the fanfare about N. Korea's missile program.",

   "Lets get real, guys, ICBMs are pointed at the sky. It really doesn't matter where their guidance system is set to send them, that can be changed in a matter of seconds. One of the biggest paper victories in US history was when Reagan got the soviets to retarget their ICBMs from US cities. For all the fanfair it got, it was little more than an idiotic publicity stunt. \n \n N Korea wants ICBMs becuase the US has recentyl taken to unilaterally spreading democracy at the point of a gun. N Korea does not want to be the next state that we decide to \"liberate\". Any second or third tier nation that we have looked at cross eyed for the last 20 years that is NOT scrambling to get nukes has got to be run by XXXXXX. If I was running Iran, Venezuela, N Korea, Egypt, or any of a dozen smaller countries that are possible targets for \"liberation\", I knwo I woudl certianly be doing everything in my power to get nukes and a means to deliver them, and the more the merrier.",
