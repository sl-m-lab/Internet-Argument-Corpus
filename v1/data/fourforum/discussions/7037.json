He bases his support on principle rather than blind party loyalty...just the opposite of numbnuts like Ted Kennedy, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and most of the remaining outspoken Democrats.\n \n The hardline Democrats will do their best to characterize the Republican administration as a total failure, regardless of the accomplishments made or the obvious progress toward a better future...at home and abroad. The Democrats are hoping for and contributing to the failure of domestic and foreign policies in the false hope that it will make them look better.\n \n If the Democrats don't ask John Dean to step aside, they are shooting themselves in the foot...and their running out of feet!\n \n It's the Howard Deans, the Ted Kennedys, the Nancy Palozzis(sp), the John Kerrys, the Robert Byrds, the Clintons (both of them) and a few others that give Democrats and XXXXXX alike a bad name. The more I hear Hillary Clinton scream and rant, the more I fear her election.\n \n Kudos to Joe Lieberman for adding some redeeming value to the Democratic party.",
