In 2000 I attended one of my CONgressman's town hall meetings held in Sun City Center, Florida (a retirement community) and asked him to support Social Security privatization and outlined CATO's plan.

For years people have said \"I could manage the money better myself\" . Now, some folks are suggesting we get the chance to try. \n \n You might have a little trouble following this one being from England, Tastyfish. I have found that often times people from other countries have a difficult time understanding what a huge, inefficient thing the US government is. WE have law enforcement agencies that can't enforce the law, we spend billions on social programs, but half that money goes just to administer them. We spend billions on education so our high school gradutes can be as smart as a French 8th graders. The goverment screwing things up is almost a cliche in america (along with a politician being honest).\n \n Personally, I am all for it. IF they don;t privatise social security, I would suggest that people take it upon themselves to set their own saving plan up. I can see the downside to te privitizsation debate, like a market crash wiping out a bunch of peoples retirement. whne we all know that is the job of the CEO's of huge corporations (had to throw in the enron reference).\n \n Seriously, even if it means having to live on 5-10% less, at least there is some security for when you retire. NASA arguably has the best and brightest folks that the American governmet has to offer. They spent billions of dollars putting the hubble in orbit and didn't think to test it before they shipped it to space. IF these are the brightest in the US Government, do you really want them to have total control over your retirement? I think not. 5% of every paycheck properly invested = big bucks when you retire. Even if you don't know a yen from a shilling, there are financial advisors that can help you out.",

   "Hmmm.. I was playing around with this idea about the private pension funds and I realised that privatising social security could be turned into almost a revolution of sort. What if the labour movement offered an alternative to profit maximizing funds and instead administered funds where the actual economic influence was the key? A highly contested and controversial issue in my country has been \"l\u00f6ntagarfonder\" (wage earners fund) where it was proposed that the government would purchase shares in all larger corporations, and give the influence to the unions representing the employed. And with time, the ownership and control of the means of production would be put in the hands of \"the people\". \n \n If each and every union would organise such a fund for its members with the intention to take control over the different sectors, and members could invest any share of their pension into these funds, the idea of wage earners funds could actually be achieved. However, it would never reach the scope of the proposed governmental wage earners funds as the fund would be \"raided\" everytime someone retired. But it could still be a large source of influence, shifted from the elite into the hands of the people.\n \n I`m starting to like privatised social security more and more ;) Of course, this is still merely a socialist wet dream, but if the larger unions could be persuaded, the smaller ones would probably do the same.",

While Social Security is getting all the ink, the Medicare trust is expected to become insolvent 21 years earlier than Social Security. The combination of baby boomers coming on line, rapidly increasing costs and an inefficient medical system presents a huge problem. From the Center for Economic & Policy Research, \"The United States has the most inefficient medical system in the world. It pays more than twice as much per person as other wealthy countries, but has little if anything to show in terms of outcomes\".\n I used to work for a computer company that supplied software to medical groups. We made a great deal of money just by selling the constant updates to Medicare software.\n Dono",
