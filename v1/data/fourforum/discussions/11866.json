MITHRAS As you can see, Mithras origins have no resemblance or similarity at all to the life or history of the Jewish Messiah, Jesus Christ.\n\n \n Who said they were identical in every aspect (who said it was about \"origins\"?)? Jesus is an amalgam of numerous earlier Gods and gets bits of his story from each. \n \n I'm thinking of the fact that there are many parallels in their \"lives\" that are quite striking. Also, a lot of Mithraic imagery (ascension into heaven, etc.) was adopted by early Christianity in images (not necessarily all on Jesus) for their stories. For example, Mithras shooting arrows into rock causing fountains of water was adapted to early images of Moses striking the stone at Horeb.\n \n Another example is the \"creative sacrifice\" of Mithras, which was adapted into Christian Imagery. In representations of both iconographic scenes the vernal sacrifice is central to the image, with sun and the moon symmetrically arranged above. Beneath the sacrifice two other figures are symmetrically arranged. \n \n In mithraic scenes these are Cautes and Cautopates, and in the Christian scenes, which date from the 4th century onwards, the figures are typically Mary and John. In other Christian instances however, these two attendants are other figures, and carry a raised and lowered object reminiscent of the raised and lowered torches of Cautes and Cautopates. \n \n Such figures include two Roman soldiers armed with lances, or Longinus holding a spear and Stephaton offering Jesus vinegar from a sponge. In some instances the clothes of these figures resemble those of Cautes and Cautopates in the earlier Mithraic depictions.\n \n Sorry for the mix-up and unclear wording.",

That was nicely worded, carefully dishonest, very like you indeed.\n \n \nIdentical Life Experiences \n \n (1) Mithra was born on December 25th as an offspring of the Sun. Next to the gods Ormuzd and Ahrimanes, Mithra held the highest rank among the gods of ancient Persia. He was represented as a beautiful youth and a Mediator. Reverend J. W. Lake states: \"Mithras is spiritual light contending with spiritual darkness, and through his labors the kingdom of darkness shall be lit with heaven's own light; the Eternal will receive all things back into his favor, the world will be redeemed to God. The impure are to be purified, and the evil made good, through the mediation of Mithras, the reconciler of Ormuzd and Ahriman. Mithras is the Good, his name is Love. In relation to the Eternal he is the source of grace, in relation to man he is the life-giver and mediator\" (Plato, Philo, and Paul, p. 15).\n \n \n (2) He was considered a great traveling teacher and masters. He had twelve companions as Jesus had twelve disciples. Mithras also performed miracles.\n \n \n (3) Mithra was called \"the good shepherd,\" \"the way, the truth and the light,\" \"redeemer,\" \"savior,\" \"Messiah.\" He was identified with both the lion and the lamb.\n \n \n (4) The International Encyclopedia states: \"Mithras seems to have owed his prominence to the belief that he was the source of life, and could also redeem the souls of the dead into the better world ... The ceremonies included a sort of baptism to remove sins, anointing, and a sacred meal of bread and water, while a consecrated wine, believed to possess wonderful power, played a prominent part.\"\n \n \n (5) Chambers Encyclopedia says: \"The most important of his many festivals was his birthday, celebrated on the 25th of December, the day subsequently fixed -- against all evidence -- as the birthday of Christ. The worship of Mithras early found its way into Rome, and the mysteries of Mithras, which fell in the spring equinox, were famous even among the many Roman festivals. The ceremonies observed in the initiation to these mysteries -- symbolical of the struggle between Ahriman and Ormuzd (the Good and the Evil) -- were of the most extraordinary and to a certain degree even dangerous character. Baptism and the partaking of a mystical liquid, consisting of flour and water, to be drunk with the utterance of sacred formulas, were among the inauguration acts.\"\n \n \n (6) Prof. Franz Cumont, of the University of Ghent, writes as follows concerning the religion of Mithra and the religion of Christ: \"The sectaries of the Persian god, like the Christians', purified themselves by baptism, received by a species of confirmation the power necessary to combat the spirit of evil; and expected from a Lord's supper salvation of body and soul. Like the latter, they also held Sunday sacred, and celebrated the birth of the Sun on the 25th of December.... They both preached a categorical system of ethics, regarded asceticism as meritorious and counted among their principal virtues abstinence and continence, renunciation and self-control. Their conceptions of the world and of the destiny of man were similar. They both admitted the existence of a Heaven inhabited by beatified ones, situated in the upper regions, and of a Hell, peopled by demons, situated in the bowels of the Earth. They both placed a flood at the beginning of history; they both assigned as the source of their condition, a primitive revelation; they both, finally, believed in the immortality of the soul, in a last judgment, and in a resurrection of the dead, consequent upon a final conflagration of the universe\" (The Mysteries of Mithras, pp. 190, 191).\n \n \n (7) Reverend Charles Biggs stated: \"The disciples of Mithra formed an organized church, with a developed hierarchy. They possessed the ideas of Mediation, Atonement, and a Savior, who is human and yet divine, and not only the idea, but a doctrine of the future life. They had a Eucharist, and a Baptism, and other curious analogies might be pointed out between their system and the church of Christ (The Christian Platonists, p. 240).\n \n \n (8) In the catacombs at Rome was preserved a relic of the old Mithraic worship. It was a picture of the infant Mithra seated in the lap of his virgin mother, while on their knees before him were Persian Magi adoring him and offering gifts.\n \n \n (9) He was buried in a tomb and after three days he rose again. His resurrection was celebrated every year.\n \n \n (10) McClintock and Strong wrote: \"In modern times Christian writers have been induced to look favorably upon the assertion that some of our ecclesiastical usages (e.g., the institution of the Christmas festival) originated in the cultus of Mithraism. Some writers who refuse to accept the Christian religion as of supernatural origin, have even gone so far as to institute a close comparison with the founder of Christianity; and Dupuis and others, going even beyond this, have not hesitated to pronounce the Gospel simply a branch of Mithraism\" (Art. \"Mithra\").\n \n \n (11) Mithra had his principal festival on what was later to become Easter, at which time he was resurrected. His sacred day was Sunday, \"the Lord's Day.\" The Mithra religion had a Eucharist or \"Lord's Supper.\"\n \n \n (12) The Christian Father Manes, founder of the heretical sect known as Manicheans, believed that Christ and Mithra were one. His teaching, according to Mosheim, was as follows: \"Christ is that glorious intelligence which the Persians called Mithras ... His residence is in the sun\" (Ecclesiastical History, 3rd century, Part 2, ch. 5).\n \n \n \n \n \"I am a star which goes with thee and shines out of the depths.\" - Mithraic saying \n \n \"I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright morning star.\" - Jesus, (Rev. 22:16) \n \n \n Interesting reading, huh?\n \n Smiley",

   "the whole Mithras influence thing is largely a lie. This is obvious to anyone who does some decent research on the Mithras cult. The \"similarities\" are the same sort of thing that happens when people try to see things like the 'anti-christ' in presidents, or apply Nostradamus' predictions to current events. There's just enough similarity there due to general events and universal themes to think there's something to it if one doesn't really investigate it, even when a closer look shows insurmountable problems with the idea, as the article linked below demonstrates. It's an influence that a lot of atheists seem to WANT to be there, and so they connect dots that aren't necessarily there.\n \n \n \" 1. Mithra was born of a virgin on December 25th in a cave, and his birth was attended by shepherds.\n \n This claim, which I have seen repeated in part by the Secular Web's James Still, is a mix of truth and obfuscations. Let's begin with the December 25th part by noting Glenn Miller's reply, which is more than sufficient: \"...the Dec 25 issue is of no relevance to us--nowhere does the NT associate this date with Jesus' birth at all.\" This is something the later church did, wherever they got the idea from -- not the apostolic church, and if there was any borrowing at all, everyone did it, for Dec. 25th was \"universally distinguished by sacred festivities\" [Cum.MM, 196] being that it was (at the time) the winter solstice.\n \n Next, the cave part. First of all, Mithra was not born of a virgin in a cave; he was born out of solid rock, which presumably left a cave behind -- and I suppose technically the rock he was born out of could have been classified as a virgin! Here is how one Mithraic scholar describes the scene on Mithraic depictions: Mithra \"wearing his Phrygian cap, issues forth from the rocky mass. As yet only his bare torso is visible. In each hand he raises aloft a lighted torch and, as an unusual detail, red flames shoot out all around him from the petra genetrix.\" [MS.173] Mithra was born a grown-up, but you won't hear the copycatters mention this! (The rock-birth scene itself was a likely carryover from Perseus, who experienced a similar birth in an underground cavern; Ulan.OMM, 36.)\n \n That leaves the shepherds, and this is one that is entirely true; although the shepherds did more than \"attend\" (unlike Luke's shepherds, they were witnesses to the birth; there was no angelic mediator), they also helped Mithra out of the rock, and offered him the first-fruits of their flock -- quite a feat for these guys in any event, considering that Mithra's birth took place at a time when (oops!) men had supposedly not been created on earth yet. [Cum.MM, 132] But the clincher here is that this scene, like nearly all Roman Mithraic evidence, dates at least a century after the time of the New Testament. It is too late to say that any \"borrowing\" was done by the Christian church -- if there was any, it was the other way around; but there probably was not. (It is fair to note also that the Iranian Mithra didn\\'t have a \"born out of rock\" story...his conception was attributed, variously, to an incestuous relationship between Ahura-Mazda and his mother, or to the plain doings of an ordinary mortal woman...but there is no virgin conception/birth story to speak of. \" more at Mithraism.

   "Mithras origins have no resemblance or similarity at all to the life or history of the Jewish Messiah, Jesus Christ.\n\n NOT TRUE!\n \n If you would have studied your history from back then you would have learned that it was very common back then to take stories that were already familiar, and change a few things in those older stories to create a new story. This happened all the time and is a well known fact.\n \n There were many mythical figures who all had the same story line as Jesus. Here are two of them on how the story of Jesus may have started (a third was Buddha). Most of this can be documented in the book 'The power of Myths\". The book (and matching PBS video from most libraries) are an excellent source of information. Keep in mind that this fable proceeded the one about Jesus, so it was well known BEFORE the story of Jesus was written. It should also be noted that the very first christians addressed their prayers to 'Our Lord the Sun' - evidencing that 'primitive' Christians were quite in the spirit of Pagan forms and ideologies. Interestingly the Egyptian sun god Horus, had pre-dated the Jesus character by thousands of years. The story of Jesus shares the following with the story of Horus:\n \n \u0095 Horus was born of the virgin Isis-Meri on December 25th in a manger.\n \u0095 His birth was being announced by a star in the East and attended by three wise men.\n \u0095 His earthly father was named \"Seb\" (\"Joseph\"). \n \u0095 He was of royal descent.\n \u0095 At age 12, he was a child teacher in the Temple.\n \u0095 A aget 30, he was baptized, having disappeared for 18 years.\n \u0095 Horus was baptized in the river Eridanus or Iarutana (Jordan) by \"Anup the Baptizer\" (\"John the Baptist\"), who was decapitated.\n \u0095 He had 12 disciples, two of whom were his \"witnesses\" and were named \"Anup\" and \"Aan\" (the two \"Johns\").\n \u0095 He performed miracles, exorcised demons and raised El-Azarus (\"El-Osiris\"), from the dead.\n \u0095 Horus walked on water.\n \u0095 His personal epithet was \"Iusa,\" the \"ever-becoming son\" of \"Ptah,\" the \"Father.\" He was thus called \"Holy Child.\"\n \u0095 He delivered a \"Sermon on the Mount\" and his followers recounted the \"Sayings of Iusa.\"\n \u0095 Horus was transfigured on the Mount.\n \u0095 He was crucified between two thieves.\n \u0095 He was buried for three days in a tomb, and then resurrected.\n \u0095 He was also called the \"Way, the Truth, the Light,\" \"Messiah,\" \"God's Anointed Son,\" the \"Son of Man,\" the \"Good Shepherd,\" the \"Lamb of God,\" the \"Word made flesh,\" the \"Word of Truth,\" etc.\n \u0095 Like Jesus, \"Horus was supposed to reign one thousand years.\"\n \u0095 Horus fed thousands (5000 to be exact) with just a few loaves of bread.\n \u0095 Horus was called \"the KRST,\" (pronounced Christ) or \"Anointed One.\"\n \u0095 He was \"the Fisher\" and was associated with the Fish (\"Ichthys\") and the Lamb.\n \n Another famous myth of the time where elements of Jesus appears is in the story of Mithras, which predates the story of Jesus by 600 years! As noted below the Orthodox Christian hierarchy is practically identical to the Mithraic version. Virtually all of the elements of the Orthodox Christian rituals (wafer, doxology, water baptism and alter) were adopted from the Mithra and earlier pagan religions. Jesus had the following similarities with Mithra, as the sun god (there's that sun worshiping aspect again) of ancient Persia:\n \n \u0095 Mithra was born on December 25th as an offspring of the Sun.\n \u0095 Both had virgin births.\n \u0095 Next to the god Ormuzd, Mithra held the highest rank among the gods of ancient Persia. Next to God, Jesus holds the next highest rank.\n \u0095 He was represented as a beautiful youth and a mediator.\n \u0095 He was considered a great traveling teacher. \n \u0095 He had twelve companions (Jesus had twelve disciples). \n \u0095 Mithra was called \"the good shepherd,\" \"the way, the truth and the light,\" \"redeemer,\" \"savior,\" \"Messiah.\" \n \u0095 He was identified with both the lion and the lamb.\n \u0095 Could also redeem the souls of the dead into heaven.\n \u0095 Ceremonies included a sort of baptism to remove sins, anointing, and a sacred meal of bread and water, while a consecrated wine, believed to possess wonderful power.\n \u0095 The mysteries of Mithras, which fell in the spring equinox, were famous even among the many Roman festivals, much like Easter is today among christians.\n \u0095 Purified themselves by baptism.\n \u0095 Their conceptions of the world and of the destiny of man were very similar.\n \u0095 They both believed in the existence of a Heaven inhabited by beatified ones, situated in the upper regions, and of a Hell, peopled by demons, situated in the bowels of the earth.\n \u0095 They both placed a flood at the beginning of history.\n \u0095 Both performed the same exact miracles.\n \u0095 They both believed in the immortality of the soul, in a last judgment, and in a resurrection of the dead.\n \u0095 They both had disciples which formed an organized church, with a developed hierarchy. \n \u0095 They both possessed the ideas of Mediation, Atonement, and a Savior, who is human and yet divine, and not only the idea, but a doctrine of the future life.\n \u0095 They both had a Eucharist or \"Lord's Supper.\"\n \u0095 They were both buried in a tomb and after three days they both rose again. Their resurrection was (is) celebrated every year.\n \u0095 They both had the sacred day of Sunday, \"the Lord's Day.\"\n \u0095 \"I am a star which goes with thee and shines out of the depths.\" - Mithraic saying\" - I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright morning star.\" - Jesus, (Rev. 22:16)\n \u0095 Both were believed to be mankind's savior.\n \u0095 Both were known as the Light of the world.\n \n Now one or two similarities I can see, but when you can comprise a long list as shown above, that speaks volumes to the open-minded person. \n \n Now my question to you is this, why spend so much time memorizing what your religion wants to spoon feed you, when you could use that same time to learn the truth about where religions came from in the first place? Don't you think that God wants you to know the truth? I'm talking about the REAL truth, not a \"version\" of it sold to you for the purpose of keeping their religion thumping along. The ONLY way that you will ever learn the unvarnished truth is by doing your own independent research. Be willing to learn it with an OPEN mind, and you'll be surprised what a little light can do for you emoticon_xgood",

   "Well, it never really was in the first place.\n \n Here's the story behind Christmas.\n \n It was adopted to appease the pagans that they converted, who worshipped the yule holiday around that time of year. In fact Christmas trees are Christianization of pagan tradition and ritual surrounding the Winter Solstice, which included the use of evergreen boughs, and an adaptation of pagan tree worship.\n \n The other part of the story involves the Roman holiday/festival of Dies Natalis Solis Invicti. This festival was held on December 25. It is better known as Sol Invictus. The use of the title Sol Invictus allowed several solar deities to be worshipped collectively, including Elah-Gabal, a Syrian sun god; Sol, the god of Emperor Aurelian (AD 270-274); and Mithras, a soldiers' god of Persian origin.\n \n Interestingly enough, Mithras is one of the Savior-Gods that Jesus Christ of the Christian Religion was developed from.\n\n \n Just out of curiousity, did Ethmi ever acknowledge this answer?\n \n Perhaps a better question to Ethmi would be why do Christians practice things that were originally started by PAGANS in the first place?\n \"Santa Clause\"?\n \"Present Giving\"?\n \n It's interesting how non-Christians typically know Christian history (in this case, why, when and where the Christians adopted these practices in the first place) better than the Christians themselves.",

   "NOT TRUE!\n \n If you would have studied your history from back then you would have learned that it was very common back then to take stories that were already familiar, and change a few things in those older stories to create a new story. This happened all the time and is a well known fact.\n \n There were many mythical figures who all had the same story line as Jesus. Here are two of them on how the story of Jesus may have started (a third was Buddha). Most of this can be documented in the book 'The power of Myths\". The book (and matching PBS video from most libraries) are an excellent source of information. Keep in mind that this fable proceeded the one about Jesus, so it was well known BEFORE the story of Jesus was written. It should also be noted that the very first christians addressed their prayers to 'Our Lord the Sun' - evidencing that 'primitive' Christians were quite in the spirit of Pagan forms and ideologies. Interestingly the Egyptian sun god Horus, had pre-dated the Jesus character by thousands of years. The story of Jesus shares the following with the story of Horus:\n \n \u0095 Horus was born of the virgin Isis-Meri on December 25th in a manger.\n \u0095 His birth was being announced by a star in the East and attended by three wise men.\n \u0095 His earthly father was named \"Seb\" (\"Joseph\"). \n \u0095 He was of royal descent.\n \u0095 At age 12, he was a child teacher in the Temple.\n \u0095 A aget 30, he was baptized, having disappeared for 18 years.\n \u0095 Horus was baptized in the river Eridanus or Iarutana (Jordan) by \"Anup the Baptizer\" (\"John the Baptist\"), who was decapitated.\n \u0095 He had 12 disciples, two of whom were his \"witnesses\" and were named \"Anup\" and \"Aan\" (the two \"Johns\").\n \u0095 He performed miracles, exorcised demons and raised El-Azarus (\"El-Osiris\"), from the dead.\n \u0095 Horus walked on water.\n \u0095 His personal epithet was \"Iusa,\" the \"ever-becoming son\" of \"Ptah,\" the \"Father.\" He was thus called \"Holy Child.\"\n \u0095 He delivered a \"Sermon on the Mount\" and his followers recounted the \"Sayings of Iusa.\"\n \u0095 Horus was transfigured on the Mount.\n \u0095 He was crucified between two thieves.\n \u0095 He was buried for three days in a tomb, and then resurrected.\n \u0095 He was also called the \"Way, the Truth, the Light,\" \"Messiah,\" \"God's Anointed Son,\" the \"Son of Man,\" the \"Good Shepherd,\" the \"Lamb of God,\" the \"Word made flesh,\" the \"Word of Truth,\" etc.\n \u0095 Like Jesus, \"Horus was supposed to reign one thousand years.\"\n \u0095 Horus fed thousands (5000 to be exact) with just a few loaves of bread.\n \u0095 Horus was called \"the KRST,\" (pronounced Christ) or \"Anointed One.\"\n \u0095 He was \"the Fisher\" and was associated with the Fish (\"Ichthys\") and the Lamb.\n \n Another famous myth of the time where elements of Jesus appears is in the story of Mithras, which predates the story of Jesus by 600 years! As noted below the Orthodox Christian hierarchy is practically identical to the Mithraic version. Virtually all of the elements of the Orthodox Christian rituals (wafer, doxology, water baptism and alter) were adopted from the Mithra and earlier pagan religions. Jesus had the following similarities with Mithra, as the sun god (there's that sun worshiping aspect again) of ancient Persia:\n \n \u0095 Mithra was born on December 25th as an offspring of the Sun.\n \u0095 Both had virgin births.\n \u0095 Next to the god Ormuzd, Mithra held the highest rank among the gods of ancient Persia. Next to God, Jesus holds the next highest rank.\n \u0095 He was represented as a beautiful youth and a mediator.\n \u0095 He was considered a great traveling teacher. \n \u0095 He had twelve companions (Jesus had twelve disciples). \n \u0095 Mithra was called \"the good shepherd,\" \"the way, the truth and the light,\" \"redeemer,\" \"savior,\" \"Messiah.\" \n \u0095 He was identified with both the lion and the lamb.\n \u0095 Could also redeem the souls of the dead into heaven.\n \u0095 Ceremonies included a sort of baptism to remove sins, anointing, and a sacred meal of bread and water, while a consecrated wine, believed to possess wonderful power.\n \u0095 The mysteries of Mithras, which fell in the spring equinox, were famous even among the many Roman festivals, much like Easter is today among christians.\n \u0095 Purified themselves by baptism.\n \u0095 Their conceptions of the world and of the destiny of man were very similar.\n \u0095 They both believed in the existence of a Heaven inhabited by beatified ones, situated in the upper regions, and of a Hell, peopled by demons, situated in the bowels of the earth.\n \u0095 They both placed a flood at the beginning of history.\n \u0095 Both performed the same exact miracles.\n \u0095 They both believed in the immortality of the soul, in a last judgment, and in a resurrection of the dead.\n \u0095 They both had disciples which formed an organized church, with a developed hierarchy. \n \u0095 They both possessed the ideas of Mediation, Atonement, and a Savior, who is human and yet divine, and not only the idea, but a doctrine of the future life.\n \u0095 They both had a Eucharist or \"Lord's Supper.\"\n \u0095 They were both buried in a tomb and after three days they both rose again. Their resurrection was (is) celebrated every year.\n \u0095 They both had the sacred day of Sunday, \"the Lord's Day.\"\n \u0095 \"I am a star which goes with thee and shines out of the depths.\" - Mithraic saying\" - I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright morning star.\" - Jesus, (Rev. 22:16)\n \u0095 Both were believed to be mankind's savior.\n \u0095 Both were known as the Light of the world.\n \n Now one or two similarities I can see, but when you can comprise a long list as shown above, that speaks volumes to the open-minded person. \n \n Now my question to you is this, why spend so much time memorizing what your religion wants to spoon feed you, when you could use that same time to learn the truth about where religions came from in the first place? Don't you think that God wants you to know the truth? I'm talking about the REAL truth, not a \"version\" of it sold to you for the purpose of keeping their religion thumping along. The ONLY way that you will ever learn the unvarnished truth is by doing your own independent research. Be willing to learn it with an OPEN mind, and you'll be surprised what a little light can do for you emoticon_xgood\n\n \n If you paid attention back on page 1 of this thread ingus, you would have seen that smiley made the same assertion as you and was soundly refuted first by me and then by jyoshu who chased him from the debate for good. So rather than waste any time going over it again, I just repost both of our posts so you can learn the truth about which of us knows our history. \n \n \nWhere you lose me is your false claim that Jesus is based on, or developed from this cultic god Mithras as if He was a manufactured icon. And here is the evidence that you are dead wrong in your false assertion. MITHRAS As you can see, Mithras origins have no resemblance or similarity at all to the life or history of the Jewish Messiah, Jesus Christ.\n\n \n \nthe whole Mithras influence thing is largely a lie. This is obvious to anyone who does some decent research on the Mithras cult. The \"similarities\" are the same sort of thing that happens when people try to see things like the 'anti-christ' in presidents, or apply Nostradamus' predictions to current events. There's just enough similarity there due to general events and universal themes to think there's something to it if one doesn't really investigate it, even when a closer look shows insurmountable problems with the idea, as the article linked below demonstrates. It's an influence that a lot of atheists seem to WANT to be there, and so they connect dots that aren't necessarily there.\n \n \n \" 1. Mithra was born of a virgin on December 25th in a cave, and his birth was attended by shepherds.\n \n This claim, which I have seen repeated in part by the Secular Web's James Still, is a mix of truth and obfuscations. Let's begin with the December 25th part by noting Glenn Miller's reply, which is more than sufficient: \"...the Dec 25 issue is of no relevance to us--nowhere does the NT associate this date with Jesus' birth at all.\" This is something the later church did, wherever they got the idea from -- not the apostolic church, and if there was any borrowing at all, everyone did it, for Dec. 25th was \"universally distinguished by sacred festivities\" [Cum.MM, 196] being that it was (at the time) the winter solstice.\n \n Next, the cave part. First of all, Mithra was not born of a virgin in a cave; he was born out of solid rock, which presumably left a cave behind -- and I suppose technically the rock he was born out of could have been classified as a virgin! Here is how one Mithraic scholar describes the scene on Mithraic depictions: Mithra \"wearing his Phrygian cap, issues forth from the rocky mass. As yet only his bare torso is visible. In each hand he raises aloft a lighted torch and, as an unusual detail, red flames shoot out all around him from the petra genetrix.\" [MS.173] Mithra was born a grown-up, but you won't hear the copycatters mention this! (The rock-birth scene itself was a likely carryover from Perseus, who experienced a similar birth in an underground cavern; Ulan.OMM, 36.)\n \n That leaves the shepherds, and this is one that is entirely true; although the shepherds did more than \"attend\" (unlike Luke's shepherds, they were witnesses to the birth; there was no angelic mediator), they also helped Mithra out of the rock, and offered him the first-fruits of their flock -- quite a feat for these guys in any event, considering that Mithra's birth took place at a time when (oops!) men had supposedly not been created on earth yet. [Cum.MM, 132] But the clincher here is that this scene, like nearly all Roman Mithraic evidence, dates at least a century after the time of the New Testament. It is too late to say that any \"borrowing\" was done by the Christian church -- if there was any, it was the other way around; but there probably was not. (It is fair to note also that the Iranian Mithra didn't have a \"born out of rock\" story...his conception was attributed, variously, to an incestuous relationship between Ahura-Mazda and his mother, or to the plain doings of an ordinary mortal woman...but there is no virgin conception/birth story to speak of. \" more at Mithraism. Not an influence on Christianity\n",

Some 50 of these places of worship still exist in the area of where the Roman empire existed.\n \n Mithraism was the main religion of Tarsus in the First century. Gosh, guess who came from Tarsus in the first century emoticon_ic\n \n Your attempt to dispute that has the 'lie of omission' in it. It concentrates on the Roman acceptance of the cult, and ignores the fact it was well established in Persia. It also ignores how Mithra was worshiped, in that time period.\n\n \n Again with unsupported opinions. Was Mithra a real person who actually lived and walked the Earth? Can you show any evidence that he did? Because his testimony is based on that claim as it compares him to Jesus who's existence as a real person is undeniable by even the secular history experts of that time period. Only the ignorant atheists \"here\" have the audacity to deny that all that occurred surrounding the life of Christ was fictional. Now show that Mithra actually lived and was born from a rock.\n \n And I must ask you trebor, why would you defend this cultic figure as real while denying that the Jewish Messiah was real when you know the high regard secular historians have for the quality and care the ancient Jews took as accurate record keepers? Aren't you jewish after all?",

Suetonius, chief secretary to Emperor Hadrian, wrote that there was a man named Chrestus (or Christ) who lived during the first century (Annals 15.44 ).\n \n Flavius Josephus is the most famous Jewish historian. In his Antiquities he refers to James, \"the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ.\" There is a controversial verse (18:3) that says, \"Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man. For he was one who wrought surprising feats. . . . He was [the] Christ . . . he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him.\" One version reads, \"At this time there was a wise man named Jesus. His conduct was good and [he] was known to be virtuous. And many people from among the Jews and the other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. But those who became his disciples did not abandon his discipleship. They reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion, and that he was alive; accordingly he was perhaps the Messiah, concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders.\"\n \n Julius Africanus quotes the historian Thallus in a discussion of the darkness which followed the crucifixion of Christ (Extant Writings, 18).\n \n Pliny the Younger, in Letters 10:96, recorded early Christian worship practices including the fact that Christians worshiped Jesus as God and were very ethical, and includes a reference to the love feast and Lord's Supper.\n \n The Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 43a) confirms Jesus' crucifixion on the eve of Passover, and the accusations against Christ of practicing sorcery and encouraging Jewish apostasy.\n \n Lucian of Samosata was a second-century Greek writer who admits that Jesus was worshiped by Christians, introduced new teachings, and was crucified for them. He said that Jesus' teachings included the brotherhood of believers, the importance of conversion, and the importance of denying other gods. Christians lived according to Jesus' laws, believed themselves immortal, and were characterized by contempt for death, voluntary self-devotion, and renunciation of material goods.\n \n Mara Bar-Serapion confirms that Jesus was thought to be a wise and virtuous man, was considered by many to be the king of Israel, was put to death by the Jews, and lived on in the teachings of his followers.\n \n Then we have all the Gnostic writings (The Gospel of Truth, The Apocryphon of John, The Gospel of Thomas, The Treatise on Resurrection, etc.) that all mention Jesus.\n \n In fact, we can almost reconstruct the gospel just from early non-Christian sources: Jesus was called the Christ (Josephus), did \"magic,\" led Israel into new teachings, and was hanged on Passover for them (Babylonian Talmud) in Judea (Tacitus), but claimed to be God and would return (Eliezar), which his followers believed - worshipping Him as God (Pliny the Younger).\n \n In conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence for the existence of Jesus Christ, both in secular and Biblical history.

They rejected the humble savior who would die for their sins as the redeemer of the world. \n \n \nI think it is hubris of Christians to tell the Jews who the 'Jewish Messiah' is supposed to be.\n\n \n What is hubris is for so many Jews, Gods chosen people to reject the promised Messiah because he doesn't fit your definition of what Yahweh's Messiah should be. That is the epitome of a hard heart.\n \n \n I notice you are unwilling to go analyze the so called 'evidence' for the historical Jesus in a one on one debate. I can only assume you have not sufficiently analyzed the claims, or you realize on how weak those claims are.\n\n \n Am I your keeper trebor? Did I not post all of the quoted references? Must I look them all up for you also? I posted the quote from the Babylonian Talmud 43a for you to get you started and show how easy it is. But the only way you will hopefully gain any real insight is to prove or disprove them yourself. So I stand by them fully, but I'm sure that wont prevent you from making your irrational assumptions. \n \n So run away and blame me if you like, but I supplied all the quotes you need to prove me wrong if they are false, where as you have provided nothing at all regarding Mithra which was the whole basis for this exchange. Nice going trebor, you have once again turned the table as you've avoided having to defend your fallacious claims.",

   "It is your post above which is insulting and condescending trebor. By simply refuting you, I'm accused of being insulting. \n \n \n \n So what? I'm going by the promises in the OT regarding the coming of the promised Messiah. Just because many modern Jews have corrupted the interpretation does nothing to nullify what the OT say's \n \n \n \n Really? You're dead wrong in this claim. I challenge you to prove using a valid theological source.\n \n \n \n Jesus meets the criteria perfectly. He just wasn't the Messiah the first century Jews wanted at the time.

I see you are back in the claim that 'insults' are refuting.\n \n In regards to Mithra, I pointed out that while Mithraism was first associated with the Rome by the end of the first century, it is a far older religion, and the persian religion had certain differences than the Roman one that you were responding to. \n \n I will also point out that 100 C.e. is about the same time frame that many of the Christian cults were forming. Same time period, same geographical area for the spread of Mithraism into the Roman Empire.\n \n You also did not refute the information that Mithraism was fully established in Tarus , the place where 'Paul/Saul' was from. You just responded with insult.\n \n You really should use better sources than Glenn Morton's 'Christian think tank\" or J.P. Holding's 'Tetoncis' for your misinformation you know.",

   "The evidence is scant indeed....Paul never met him, excepting his \"vision\" of him.\n \n G.A. Wells - The Historical Evidence for Jesus[pp. 22-23], sums Paul's thin contribution:\n \n \" ... The...Pauline letters...are so completely silent concerning the events that were later recorded in the gospels as to suggest that these events were not known to Paul, who, however, could not have been ignorant of them if they had really occurred. \n These letters have no allusion to the parents of Jesus, let alone to the virgin birth. They never refer to a place of birth (for example, by calling him 'of Nazareth'). They give no indication of the time or place of his earthly existence. They do not refer to his trial before a Roman official, nor to Jerusalem as the place of execution. They mention neither John the Baptist, nor Judas, nor Peter's denial of his master. (They do, of course, mention Peter, but do not imply that he, any more than Paul himself, had known Jesus while he had been alive.)\n \n These letters also fail to mention any miracles Jesus is supposed to have worked, a particularly striking omission, since, according to the gospels, he worked so many...\n \n Another striking feature of Paul's letters is that one could never gather from them that Jesus had been an ethical teacher... on only one occasion does he appeal to the authority of Jesus to support an ethical teaching which the gospels also represent Jesus as having delivered. ....\"",

Why should Paul's silence on these particular issues mean they never happened? What is Paul supposed to do ... rewrite the entire Christian story at length in every letter he wrote? Paul also doesn't mention the weather in Ephesus where he wrote 1 Corinthians. Doesn't mean we can automatically assume it couldn't possibly have been a sunny day. Say what you want about miracles, but it's not like the historicity of Rabbi Jesus in the 1st century is a stretch, at least in terms of pretty normal things like having parents, living in Jerusalem, being executed the Roman authorities, etc. So to argue from silence in terms of one letter-writing Christian leader who was writing to address specific issues doesn't exactly speak to much here.",

   "I feel that atheists observe Christian holidays because they don't fully understand what is being celebrated. For example, you walk into Walmart right after Halloween and see the Christmas things on the shelf. With how Christmas has become today, it seems as if the true meaning has been lost among Santa and all the new \"toys\" we expect to see under our tree.\n\n I fully understand what is being celebrated at Christmas tide: rebirth of the sun, lengthening days, more warmth, seeding that the end of winter is coming.\n \n Easter tide is to celebrate redemption in that one has survived the winter without starving or freezing to death.\n \n And, Easter is, most assuredly, a pagan word. The correct term for the Christian holiday celebrated at that time is The Passion.",
