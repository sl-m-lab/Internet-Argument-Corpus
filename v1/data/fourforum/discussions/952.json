   "Unfortunately for XXXXXX like Behe, it is now widely know that:\n \n -The basal portion of the bacterial flagellum is homologous with Type III Protein Secretion Systems. Although the TTSS is probably decended from the flagellum (its used as a weapon against eukaryotic cells, which flagella probably predate), its a prime example of how components of \"irreducibly complex\" systems can have selectable functions outside of the IC system itself.\n \n -The flagellar motor proteins (MotA and MotB) are distant homologs of other bacterial membrane proteins (ExbB-ExbD).\n \n -The ATPase for flagellar construction has similar homologies, perhaps, as Rizzotti (2000) claims, suggesting evolution from a F1F0 ATPase.\n \n Conclusion: Behe's argument is fundamentally unsound. \n \n -GFA",
