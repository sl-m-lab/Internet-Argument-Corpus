   "What state do you live in?\n\n \n I live in MD. They haven't banned Harry Potter here, that was in the South. They still ban books here but most are for a better reason. Here's a rediculous one.\n \n An illustrated edition of \"Little Red Riding Hood\" was banned in two California school districts in 1989. Following the Little Red-Cap story from Grimm's Fairy Tales, the book shows the heroine taking food and wine to her grandmother. The school districts cited concerns about the use of alcohol in the story. \n \n For others go to http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/banned-books.html\n \n Here's a web site with the top 50 challenged books. \n http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/People/spok/most-banned.html \n \n Among them are:\n \n Of Mice and Men - John Steinbeck\n The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn - Mark Twain\n Scary Stories in the Dark (along with the 2 sequals II and III) - Alvin Schwartz\n The Witches - Roald Dahl\n A Wrinkle in Time - Madeleine L'Engle\n How to Eat Fried Worms - Thomas Rockwell\n Halloween ABC - Eve Merriam\n Little Red Riding Hood - Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm\n Slaughterhouse-five - Kurt Vonnegut\n Lord of the Flies - William Golding\n The Grapes of Wrath - John Steinbeck\n The Advendures of Tom Sawyer - Mark Twain\n \n Now I wrote these there because they are really stupid (Halloween ABC??? Scary Stories in the Dark is a compilation of scary stories and Little Red Riding Hood???). But most of them are just plain good books. I have read most of these books and I have loved every one of them.\n \n I have absolutely no idea why Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer were banned, both great stories of 2 young boys living in the south.\n \n The Steinbeck books were the ones I was referring to that actually makes you think. Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men really made you think.\n \n I haven't read Slaughterhouse-five yet but have read many other books by Vonnegut and can't see why they would be banned.\n \n The Witches is a childrens book (Roald Dahl) that I read when I was like 7. Probably requested to be banned because of Witches like Harry Potter.\n \n How to Eat Fried Worms is just another easy read, a childrens book. It goes through a bet made that a person couldn't eat 20 worms, cooked however they want. His parents support him and cook the worm in with a delicious meal and they find some disgusting stuff. But bannable material? No.\n \n A Wrinkle in Time is another great book about a child who's father went missing after an experiment with a way of traveling called wrinkleing. The shortest distance of a straight line is wrinkled up and you can go directly from one point to another instantaneously. They go to save their dad on a distant planet and save him from a planet that likes to have total equality (people must bounce their ball in a rhythm at the same time during playtime and one kid who just has fun is killed, or \"put to sleep\"). As I said, another great book and I can't imagine why it would be banned.\n \n Lord of the Flies I've heard is great. I'm supposed to read that this year so I'll see then. But I know it's considered a classic. I don't know about bannable material.\n \n \n In short it seems as if they want to ban these books to take away our ability to think. I believe we should be able to expand our thinking and even if this book presents a \"wrong\" point of view you can always learn from it. I'm not sure but I think The Bible along with other holy books are banned also. Now I don't believe in the bible or any other book as being holy but I can read it and learn what other people believe and for people to tell me I can't read it is absurd.
