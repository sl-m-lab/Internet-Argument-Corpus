Apparently, teachers spend about half a year playing \"remember what you learned last year\" before they really introduce new material. In essence, you go to school for 12 years to get 6 years worth of education. This is a horrible waste.\n \n \n HEre in KS, those who disagreed with year round school used the tired old \"farmers kids\" excuse fro why we need summer break. They were unable to find a farmer who thought it would really adversely effect the operations of their farm. We now rely on traactors instead of horse drawn plows. We plant earlier (before kids are out of school as it is now). IT is nice to have the kids around for harvest (to drive the grain truck) but not a requirement. It used to take 7 people to harvest and acre in 7 hours. Now, 2 people can do it in a less than half an hour.\n \n As far as the kids needing time to \"unwind\" or to have something to \"look forward to\", the plans for year round school I have seen did not increase the number of days off at all, rather they broke them up into smaller breaks.\n \n I know kids don't want to loose their summer break, but all I can say to this point is \"Get over it, get used to it, move on\". ONce you are out of school and out in the world, tere is no summer break.

Our year starts at the beginning of Febuary, and finsihes in early December. This kind of setup allows Australian students to have 2 or so months off around summer which also happens to be Christmas, as well as enjoying small breaks throughout the year.\n \n Personally, I think this way of structuring the school year is sensible, as it gives the student the opportunity to work hard for 9-10 weeks, knowing that there is a rest period after that to recuperate, and maybe even read over a thing or two from the work completed throughout the term.\n \n Reading through the replies, it seems a concern people have is balancing school with work and sports also.

I think we need to change the system so kids don't get used to having a long summer break, because once you get out, there is no such thing. I would argue that in college a summer break is a good thing only because a lot of people who put themselves thorugh college (I was on of them) really need a few months to make some real money so they can afford to live during the school year. Of course, we could break the college year into trimesters and allow one trimester to be optional to allow people to work. College towns are sometimes really tough places to get jobs, especially good jobs. The best job I ever found in a college town only paid $8.30/hr and was only 20 hours a week. During hte summer I could frame houses for $19.50 / hr and was guranteed 60 hours a week.\n \n \nOne reason for having summer vacation from school was so the children could help harvest the crops. There is no need for this now. The family farms have all but totally disappeared.\n\n \n THere are still plenty of family farms. Now we have great big tractors and combines with 45 ft cutting heads. Farming is not the labor intensive job it once was. While it is nice to have the kids around to drive the grain truck during harvest, it is by no means necessary.\n \n \nNine weeks on, two weeks off, with extended off times in the winter and summer months would work fine. The off times could be rotated so that only a third of the students were off at one time, except for the winter and summer vacations when they'd all be off at once. This would offer a constantly available labor pool to employers willing to hire multiple \"rotating\" workers for odd jobs and unskilled labor.\n\n \n Except for my above concerns about college students, I agree 100%",

   "I know of 2 types of \"year rounds\" in the US. Here they are:\n One is the one talked about in the thread (ex: 8 weeks on, 2-3 off). The other assumes attendance in 3 month quarters: A teacher teaches the same 3 of 4 quarters each year, the student attends the same 3 of 4 quarters every year[Example: Student picks (rather, parent picks): Are you a beach person? be off July/Aug/Sep; a skier? be of Jan/Feb/Mar; family style vacation? take April / May/ June; traveller? Oct/Nov/Dec. Then you attend the other 3 quarters of the year.]\n \n I taught about 30 years. My only objection to \"year rounds\" was the heat. If it was air conditioned (some areas in schools were), then fine, I'd gladly have gone all year. The kids didn't \"lose\" thinking patterns over the summer.I didn't need 3 weeks to reteach in the fall. (I would have chosen the more standard 8 weeks on, 2 weeks off)\n \n However, there are other odd systems: one of my student teachers got a job out west and they had the goofy rotating schedule above: He was an avid skier, so he taught from April to Dec.; and every year, the same kids came from April to December. It was a way to allow the building to accomodate more kids (if only 3/4 were there at any one time, then you got more use of it - the 1/4 didn't \"overcrowd\" the place) However, the community has to really be stable - you can't have frequent \"movers\" as I did.\n -----------------------\n The general concept of \"the school year\" is totally agrarian. Farmers are basically done harvesting by Sept., so kids could attend school. But, planting help was needed in June. All the kids could go to school all year and learn; but summer, they were needed home. [Look in your own family histories at the # of deaths in August - did you find a lot? Even the older family memebers were in the fields - lots of heart attacks ](my hubby is from a farming family). \n \n Since we are basically not an agrarian society now, the concept of \"year rounds\" is totally feasible - provided it isn't so warm, kids fall asleep (not to mention teachers!). If you are in an upscale community which can support something like the 3 mos off/9 on...fine. If the parents support the school, then it is great; they support education & kids are less likely to need reteaching. (In my urban school, this never would have worked)",

   "Inmyopinion states\n \n \nThe general concept of \"the school year\" is totally agrarian.\nI agree with that 100%. The school year had been determined by the sowing and harvesting cycle of agriculture. Perhaps we should consider that it might be beneficial for children's school year to mirror the natural planting, growing and cycles of the world around them. Also, in the story of Genesis, a story I believe that also reflects stages of the human creative process, it calls for a time of rest. My feeling is that in their early (until they are 10 or 12 years old) children require less time in school (i.e. less structured time) and more \"free time\". Year round schooling is being discussed to accommodate parents who are under a tremendous amount of daily stress in modern society, not to facilitate the children's learning process. Our progress as a civil, harmonious society can be directly linked to the increased importance placed on formal schooling and degrees. Despite that misplaced stress on formal schooling, it is still some of our lowest academic achievers who have excelled in life. From Einstein to Bill Gates. Perhaps if children had more time off they would have time to avail themselves of their own inner knowledge and understanding and time to synthesize on their own the information they are bombarded with every day.",

   "It is apparent most do not know how the Year Round School system works. A student is not in school for the whole year. Each school or town is set up into a 4 block system. While 3 blocks are attending school, the 1 block is out. It works like this: basically 3 months in school, 3 weeks off, for the whole 12 months of the year. This opens up a vast amount of opportunities for the students as well as the teachers! Students can be involved all year in projects or sports, they can catch attend a class during the \"off\" time if they need to catch up, families are not limited to the summer for vacation time, they are not home in front of a t.v. or video game for 12 weeks during the summer! Teachers are employed all year, they can take vacations though out the whole year, teachers can help students who need the extra help. There is less need for parents to try to find a sitter for 12 or more weeks for younger kids. You people really need to know how the system works before you give you opinion\n on some thing you know nothing about. As a student, I attended a YR school. As an adult and parent, I wish we had the YRS. I have seen many students in my childrens classes who whould have benifited greatly from the YRS. It is time we start looking at the progress the world around us has made and then look in the mirror. We need to catch up!",
