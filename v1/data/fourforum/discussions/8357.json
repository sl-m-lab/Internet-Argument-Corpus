   "I am an amateur video game programmer hoping to break into the industry one day. I was wondering if anybody has any ideas for a cool video game. The only limit is your imagination. This forum can discuss plots, gameplay, user interface, etc. Personally, I enjoy free roaming RPG games. Since I want to start off with something simple for my first project, I am thinking of making a game similar to the original Grand Theft Auto or Metal Gear with a bit more depth, lots of action and gore, and RPG elements mixed in. I have developed a system for controlling a 2D game with the mouse and keyboard just like you would play a first-person shooter. The mouse moves a targeting reticle on the screen that gets bigger or smaller depending on what you are doing. You move your character with the WASD keys, just like a first person shooter. This would allow full 360 degree shooting even in a 2D game. I think it would be pretty cool. Hopefully, I'll have the time to program it one of theses days.",

   "I have a few good plot ideas. Good is an opinionated term though so I at least think they are good. I haven't shared them with anyone else so I don't know what other people would think. They are all scifi or fantasy rpg type and I'd want to be the main storyline writer if they were used. Since you are looking for something simple to start with it may not be the best idea to start with a rpg though.",
