   "Great blog \n http://www.huffingtonpost.com/toby-barlow/satan-announces-oppositio_b_26753.html\n \n I love the quote from one of the posters\n \n\"The only behavior he could endorse, he said, were acts that promoted hate and misery, along with any prejudices that ripped communities apart.\"\n \n When did Satan become a Christian?\n\n Got to find a way to use this in my signature\n \n or there was this one\n \n \nSounds like Hell is going to be full of right-wing Christian values voters, which is exactly where they should be. It's almost enough to make me want to believe in god and Christianity. But, alas, I don't believe in magic.\n",
