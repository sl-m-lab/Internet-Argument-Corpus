   "Wow, this thread materialized quickly. I wish I had known about it sooner so I could have tossed in my 2 cents before it turned into a gay rights conversation. I wanted to know about the world issues that Matthew S was going to solve with his magic wand. In response to those, a tariff that would make foreign labor equal to that in the US?!? Do you want to kill expansion altogether? Through capitalism, the way to overcome is to grow. Our economy would probably be cut in half if you were to impose that tariff. I can see it now, I would be out of a job for sure. My job is in investments and mutual funds. If the DJIA were to fall 6,000 points in a day, people would liquidate their investments, and businesses would go out of business all over the place. Prices would sky rocket while money supply initially would not. The FED would try and pump up the money supply to combat the incredible losses which would cause inflation to roar forward as well. People's situation would become misreable. I guess that tariff that causes equaling of wages would go away. Here in the US we'd be lucky to make pennies an hour. Unless inflation took over and we would be making 100s of dollars an hour with the real value of a few pennies an hour. Closely following would be the collapse of our currency and the probable infighting from fear. All retirement plans are washed out. Remember Hoovervilles? We could call the new ones, Matthewvilles except they would probably be far worse off. And you think the condition would only be limited to the US? No sir. The effects of such a dramatic crash would be felt worldwide throwing every nation with an economy into a financial dark ages that would take decades to recover from. My advice to everyone if Matthew S stumbles upon a magic wand, buy gold. Not gold stock, I mean physical gold. It'll be the only thing that hold value after the catastrophe that would have been released upon the earth. \n \n I do not really remember the rest of the stuff that Matthew S mentioned because I forgot it after I read the other 40 or so posts.

   "Wow, this thread materialized quickly. I wish I had known about it sooner so I could have tossed in my 2 cents before it turned into a gay rights conversation. I wanted to know about the world issues that Matthew S was going to solve with his magic wand. In response to those, a tariff that would make foreign labor equal to that in the US?!? Do you want to kill expansion altogether? Through capitalism, the way to overcome is to grow. Our economy would probably be cut in half if you were to impose that tariff. I can see it now, I would be out of a job for sure. My job is in investments and mutual funds. If the DJIA were to fall 6,000 points in a day, people would liquidate their investments, and businesses would go out of business all over the place. Prices would sky rocket while money supply initially would not. The FED would try and pump up the money supply to combat the incredible losses which would cause inflation to roar forward as well. People's situation would become misreable. I guess that tariff that causes equaling of wages would go away. Here in the US we'd be lucky to make pennies an hour. Unless inflation took over and we would be making 100s of dollars an hour with the real value of a few pennies an hour. Closely following would be the collapse of our currency and the probable infighting from fear. All retirement plans are washed out. Remember Hoovervilles? We could call the new ones, Matthewvilles except they would probably be far worse off. And you think the condition would only be limited to the US? No sir. The effects of such a dramatic crash would be felt worldwide throwing every nation with an economy into a financial dark ages that would take decades to recover from. My advice to everyone if Matthew S stumbles upon a magic wand, buy gold. Not gold stock, I mean physical gold. It'll be the only thing that hold value after the catastrophe that would have been released upon the earth. \n \n I do not really remember the rest of the stuff that Matthew S mentioned because I forgot it after I read the other 40 or so posts. I do not want to get into a gay rights conversation though. My thoughts on it generally tend toward what Bassman says but I do not want to talk about it because it doesn't really interest/concern me and it is not why I wanted to enter this thread.\n \n One last thing though.\n \n What the hell is all this predjudice bullcrap shooter?

Do not throw this ad hominem mental excrement into their conversation. They are disagreeing on an issue and presenting what they think/feel and there is no room for that garbage.\n\n \n I am talking about companies going to mexico, china, or india where they can pay people a fraction of what they can pay people here. The solution is force them to bring those jobs back into the country. You take away their advantage of moving maufacturing to the other country by adding, or a better idea would be a tax, the price of what they would have payed people here to make the same product. \n \n So here is how it works a company here pays a worker 10$ an hour then it moves that job to another country and pays a person 10$ day. Based upon an 8 hour day the savings to the company is 70$ per day. Now you add up how many workers were displaced by the company moving then just either tax, tarrif, or fine the company 70$ a day times the number of workers. Now the company is free to still move but there won't be labor savings advantage.\n \n Here is the rest of the first post\n \n 2 High gas prices\n \n You simply make illegal to sell oil over a certain price within the bounds of the USA. We regulate the price of electicity so this is no different.\n \n \n 3 The situation in Iraq\n \n You pull all foriegn troops out immediately. Then you turn Bush and Chaney over to the court to be tried for war crimes.\n \n \n 4 Stopping the Religious right\n \n \n Make it illegal for any religious organization or organizations with religious missions or statements to influence, support the creation of laws or create through ballot iniatives. This is what I would add to the constitution.\n \n To secure and preserve the benefits of religious freedom in our society; All laws weather in this constitution or created by the legislature, local authority, or penal code which are based on religious beliefs or proposed and supported by any religious organization past or present shall be removed and considered void. Further no religious group, church, or any organization that has a religious statement or mission, may indorse, propose, any legislation, politician, ballot initiative, or give any financial support to anything political or receive funding from any government agency for any purpose.",

There is a major part of the economy you are forgetting. The stock holders. They want to see profits. People won't invest with you if you cannot show increasing profits.

Cost cutting it important. Your method does not help the people in the other countries either. The business will not go there for their labor so they have little to no economic activity. The investor back in the USA does not get any benefit either. Neither does the company. All that happens is the economy (global and US) shrinks. It is an all around bad idea.

That will also eventually propel us into using something different from gasoline one day. If you set a ceiling on the gas prices and the price of oil and the cost refining it plus any taxes exceeds the price allowed to be charged then gasoline stations are going to fold up all over the place. It is different from region to region as well. In CA, the gas price is much higher than here in AL. So, is this a federal regulation or a state one? And if the prices need changing do you change the ceiling? If you do, then what is the point of the ceiling in the first place? And if you are just trying to target profits, why? Should no company be allowed to make money. Ya know if that happens, we are all boned. \n \n 3.) Ok wait a second here.

It was executed poorly because America is too worried about what the ninnies from the rest of the world are thinking. But we are there now.

It may one day happen to me and it would not be fun. But it is how capitalism operates and it is why you and I are living as well as we are. If it is something illegal, like cooking books, then most definitely it must be stopped. But if a company wants to go in a certain direction, then by all means let them go that way. Use economic forces against them if you don't like it and don't support them. If enough people think like that then there is no way they will succeed. Another way to keep companies in the United States is to change all of US manufacturing into a completly automated system. I'm talking an entirely cyber nation. After the initial installation, that will be by far the cheapest labor. I'm sorry for the person who is out of a job, but it is not the government's responsibility to set them up with another one. If they are disabled, and are unable to find a job, then the government can help out but if they are able bodied people then it is up to them to get a job. \n By the way, the reason that gas prices have gone up so much is not solely because of American problems. The enormous increases in demand from nations like China and India have put immense strain on oil prices. No one was feeling sorry for the oil companies when oil was $20 a barrel. Why should they be punished now once their commodity has finally become very expensive and in ultra high demand? \n \n \nNot our problem if you truely believe in democracy then let the Iraqis decide what is best for them.

Their method of voting was dipping their finger in a dellible ink that was not easy to wash off so it was quite evident for a couple of days whether or not one voted. Under threat of DEATH, 72% of Iraqi's went to the polls and voted. If that does not show that the Iraqi's want a democracy, I don't know what does. If we are to pack up and leave tomorrow, Iran will roll in and not allow that democracy that they want and were willing to participate in under threat of death.

   "I will address only the two economic policies you chose.\n \n \n1 outsourcing\n \n I would add a tarriff to all products of companies that have things made in factories outside the US with sub USA wages. You simply add the price that they would pay the workers here to the price of the goods being make elsewhere. Make it not cost effective for them to move maufacturing outside the US to save labor costs.\n\n \n The consequence for this is higher prices for all goods and services, especially for basic imported goods such as clothes, harming primarily low income earners. The economic case against tariffs is so firm you may as well toss out all of economic theory as try and ignore it. Overall employment should show no change or decline depending on minimum wage levels, as increased jobs in some formerly import markets (eg clothing manufacture) are counterbalanced by reduced jobs in export markets.\n \n \n2 High gas prices\n \n You simply make illegal to sell oil over a certain price within the bounds of the USA. We regulate the price of electicity so this is no different.\n\n \n Consequence: Shortages proportional to the difference between the market value of oil and the government decreed price of oil.

Another blind swing because the conservatives are crying that they lost. We don't call you anarchists do we?

I sure as hell hope so. \n \n \nor how is a little girl supposed to be the \"help-mate\" to her husband if she is being raised by lesbians?? \n\n \n Is this your big dream for your little girl? Whatever will you do if she wants - I dunno - to be a doctor or dancer or singer or scientist or SINGLE?\n \n \nNo, Jito. With all due respect, it is nothing but a counterfeit. \n\n \n My family is not counterfeit. And at least we are not evangelical - where the men are so cowardly that they need door mats for wives and they raise their children to think its OK to beat up, threaten, and force garbage down the throat of those children in gay families since (as you have clearly demonstrated here) not ALL children matter.
