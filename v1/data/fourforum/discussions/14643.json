   "YouTube - Evolution in Action\n\n Of course. A ring species. And also the Greenish warblers around the Tibetan plateau. Where the two branches meet in southern Siberia, they do not interbreed.\n \n Previously, several species of northern gulls (of the genus Larus) that encircle the arctic were thought to be a ring species, formed from several phenotypically and morphologically different species that are still able to hybridize where they overlap. However, recent genetic research has shown that the case is more complicated than that. It seems that the various species are all descended from two refuge populations from a single population that were driven south during the last ice age. At the end of the ice age, as the gull populations moved north, they formed what is now a single, contiguous, interbreeding population in which the extremes can no longer interbreed (i.e., herring gulls and lesser black backed gulls that occupy the same range in northern Europe). Additionally, gull populations to the south, that are undoubtedly descendants of the previously ice age isolated populations. I refer you to the range of the American herring gull as depicted in The Sibley Guide to Birds. Herring gulls are found in non-mountainous regions across the US in the summer, and across the north of Canada and the northern part of the eastern US in the winter. I have seen them in Montana (spring and fall), Massachusetts and Maine (year round), and on the gulf coast of Texas (summer).\n \n Thus, a population that now appears to be a single contiguous population is actually the result of two refuge populations that rejoined at the end of the last ice age.

   "Awesome!\n \n By the way, if you want to weep for humanity read the comments on that video. *sigh*\n\n Yeah verily! For example:\n \ndog races are much more different&#65279; from one another than these salamanders yet they interbreed just fine. what do we make of this?\n\n We make of it that the poster is an XXXXX who doesn't bother to think. In fact, dogs (a genetically verified species of wolf) of similar size are able to interbreed. But the extremes of size (e.g., Great Dane or St. Bernard vs. chihuahua) are not able to interbreed by any means. Certainly not naturally. And given the difference in size, even if artificially inseminated, the offspring are still born - the morphological differences are not compatible and produce non-viable monsters. In the case of a large sire and a miniature dame, the dame is likely to die.\n \n So, no. Dog races don't interbreed just fine. In the case of dogs, it is extremes in size, rather than extremes in geography that prevent interbreeding.\n \nUnless they have been watching and documenting the evolution of&#65279; these salamanders from north to south, I have a hard time believing that it's anything less than a theory of how the southernmost two came to be.\n\n Exactly! It is a theory. In other words, it isn't a guess. It is an observation that has been tested. I wonder if that poster could give us his/her \"theory\" as to the origin of why the extremes of a single population cannot interbreed.\n \nThen why didn't black people start adapting yet. The ones that were brought from Africa to here haven't started adapting to the weather. None of this XXXX proves evolution. Evolution is just a bunch of XXXXXXXX that cannot be proven and never will be. The evolutionists are just going to say I'm to ignorant to understand instead of explain it, becuase [sic] they can't prove&#65279; this dumb XXXX. The fossils in the museums don't prove XXXX either.\n\n But African-Americans have adapted. Only a religious bigot who doesn't want to learn would say otherwise. In fact, the incidence of sickle-cell anemia is much less in African-Americans than among their ancestors in west Africa. The reason is simple. In west Africa individuals who are heterozygous for a single point mutation on a single gene are resistant to malaria. As a result, individuals who don't have a mutated gene are more likely to die from malaria. Those who have two mutated genes die from sickle-cell anemia. Those who are heterozygous for the gene (one normal and one sickle-cell) are resistant to malaria.\n \n In the US, malaria isn't a problem. As a result, over the last 4 or 5 hundred years, the frequency of the sickle-cell mutation among Afro-Americans has decreased. In this country, it is no longer offers a beneficial reproductive advantage, and, in fact, is selected against. Thus, that particular allele frequency has decreased.\n \nWhy is it that stupid evolutionists look at 2 diffrent [sic] colored reptiles and call them different species but look at a blond blue eyed American and a Chinese and call them both human? You are brain damaged if you think a cacoon [sic] can shed its skin and turn into a butterfly without intelligent design. If you think it can, then&#65279; you should be able to shed your skin and turn into Brad Pitt\n\n As was pointed out, they weren't reptiles, they were amphibians. Further, a human of any hair color or any eye color interbreeding with any other hair or eye color is a red herring. All humans are of a single species. While there may be certain physiological differences between various human populations, none has been separated for long enough to make a separate species. But in the case of these amphibians, they have been evolving for far longer that the human race has existed. Thus, the extremes of this population are no longer able to interbreed.\n \n How is it that all this individual understood from that video was that they were different colored? How stupid can one be?",
