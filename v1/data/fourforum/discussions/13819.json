   "What's the scoop here?\n\n \n I dunno. What is the scoop here? You complain about the responses we give, and yet you keep coming back for more. Even people with down syndrome learn enough to only stick their hands in the open flame once.\n \n \nIt seems to me with all the shootings that occur in the United States because of all the gun happy nuts running around, everyone would know how to do first aid at the site of a shooting.\n\n \n Any evidence to support your foolish belief that it's the law-abiding gun owners who're shooting people and committing crimes?\n \n \nI understand bullet wounds are kind of nasty because they're deep.\n \n \n Actually depth has nothing to do with it. You can be shot through and through and suffer no serious injuries. What matters is what's hit in the middle.\n \n Of course knife wounds are far worse. You've got a small hole versus a deep gash that'll cut arteries and organs in its path.\n \n \nThere's also the massive loss of blood; To be sure, the massive bleeding would wash out nasty debris but a body can't stand to lose a bunch of blood.\n\n \n When you're shot there's something called a temporary wound cavity, which the muscle and tissue closes in on. Bleeding out, at least based on what I've read, isn't the most likely cause of death unless something vital is actually hit.\n \n And what does this little blurb of yours have to do with anything?",

Liberals put on a great show about caring so much about saving lives and making things better. But when confronted with the fact that there's more than one way to murder people in a crime, they claim that the other methods don't matter as much because not as many people die.\n \n So is it that you really don't care about saving the lives of innocent people? Or is it that just not enough people are currently dying from stabbings and beatings for you to care? What is it, do you have a death quota to fill or something?",
