They have acted immorally.\n\n \n It's not immoral if they acted according to their own morals.\n \n \nthe inception of laws and justice for all on the basis of an accepted code of ethics shows that there is an absolute morality that we hold to.\n\n \n If there were an absolute morality there would be no need for laws and for justice. We would simply not do what we say we won't do.\n \n Name any conceivable act, like the torture of a child, and I can give you a moral justification for it. \n \n \nHow does that change the sense of what the person is saying? If morality is relative, how can a person say I \"ought not\" to kill him or that I \"may not\" kill him? In a world where morality is relative his comments would be arbitrary because I can do whatever I feel like doing.\n\n \n Now you're getting it.\n \n You can say someone ought not to kill you out of pure self-interest. You don't need to argue an absolute moral against killing in expressing your own desire to live.\n \n \nEvidence shows that people aspire to a morality that is universal. Again, laws and rules that are in place all around the world show this to be true.\n\n \n Aspirations and a dollar won't buy a cup of coffee. It doesn't matter what people want -- it matters how they act, and they always act out of self-interest.\n \n \nPeople will always fight against these due to the sinful nature of man.\n\n \n No, they fight against arbitrary moral absolutes because people are people.\n \n \nA person is always free to do what is right in his own eyes, but, if there was no underlying sense of right and wrong built into humanity, why would a person ever feel guilty about something? Why would anybody experience a guilty conscience?\n\n \n Easy. Self-interest.\n \n There is an intellectual chasm between an underlying sense of right and wrong and the existence of moral absolutes.\n \n We may have a natural aversion to killing (although I am not convinced we do), but we have no compunction to the dropping of incendiary or nuclear bombs on civilian targets. Given the right circumstances, it's all good.\n \n \nHere in Britain there is a law that says I cannot walk into the supermarket and collect a basket of groceries without paying. That would be stealing and if I was caught I would be arrested. That is an absolute.\n\n \n Oh please. Is the penalty for shoplifting death? Are you saying ALL shoplifters in the United Kingdom are arrested on the spot, prosecuted and sentenced to prison?\n \n What about the 11 year old who grabs a candy bar and runs, without paying? Is an example made of him or her?\n \n Boy, talk about shooting yourself in the foot. There isn't a law in your country that is absolutely enforced with absolute determination. It's ALL relative.\n \n \nThe law of the land tells me that I would be arrested. Many crimes deemed more serious are often settled in court. Your statement that we do not have courts that enforce an absolute morality makes no sense in light of this.\n\n \n No, it makes perfect sense. An absolute morality would mean no one would shoplift or commit murder. Even if you don't adhere to that, surely an absolute morality would demand absolute enforcement of the laws -- but that obviously isn't true, is it. I'm sure your prosecutors are engaged in plea bargains with criminals, just as American prosecutors do. Where's the \"absolute morality\" in that?\n \n \nNations have of course developed due to culture, etc, and these countries each govern themselves individually. However, each nation has rules and laws and a system of government, and the vast majority of these laws are accepted worldwide.\n\n \n Are they?\n \n Most people live in countries that use the death penalty. Is the death penalty accepted worldwide?\n \n \nNations have formed because over time people groups have come together because they share the same cultural components and so forth. Each nation is recognised as being independent and so justice within that country is handled by that country. The fact that each country around the world by and large ascribes to a shared and universal morality shows that this morality is inbred and definite.\n\n \n Again you're conflating innate morals with absolute morals. An individual moral sense is easily and frequently compromised. No one lives by an absolute moral code. You break such a code every time you break the speed limit, every time you park your car in an illegal space or longer than is permitted by law, every time you fail to pay every nickel in taxes your government wants you to pay.\n \n Absolute morals? Absolute c#rap.\n \n \nSuppose I desired to walk up to a man (someone I do not know) on a street in order to kill him. National laws aside (since it could be in any country), would it or would it not be wrong for me to kill him? If it would be wrong for me to kill him, please tell me why.\n\n \n I'm not saying it is.\n \n It should be, and I wish it was in all circumstances, but it isn't.\n \n I can conceive of a number of circumstances in which killing a total stranger is justified. What if the stranger was Orenthal James Simpson? What he were a genocidal maniac? What if he was a terrorist?\n \n So much for absolute morals.",

I just want to say a few words about this mischaracterization of natural selection. \"Survival of the fittest\" is a social darwinist phrase to begin with and it is missing one essential feature - adaptation to the environment which results in differential reproduction rates. That's the difference between \"survival of the fittest\" and natural selection. With respect to evolution survival is nothing but a means to passing genes onto the next generation. Passing these genes on may involve the survival of many individuals working together for their mutual survival. And if this mutual aid results in more genes being passed on, then natural selection will favor compassion, cooperation and social behavior. \n \n Even at the cellular level, natural selection has favored the evolution of colonies and multicellularity because it allowed for passing more genes onto the next generation. So the key concept is survival, adaptation to the environment and differential reproduction - not individual selfishness. In order to make the case that religion or belief in God is necessary for being moral, these evo-deniers have to manufacture this straw man depiction of evolution as the product of immoral, or amoral, God deniers.

It is true that there is a selfish element to all cooperative social behavior. Just the thought of seeing people smiling and enjoying themselves will raise my spirits. We are so hard wired to be social that normal non-sociopathic people are happiest when they make others happy. The real problem is when a political or social or moral system expects people to make themselves miserable for the benefit of society. I see that happen in some religions that demand self sacrifice. I see it in totalitarian ideologies that talk only of the benefit to society at the expense of individual liberties. And I see it in the workplace where employees must dedicate themselves to the corporation as wage slaves. At any rate, there is a fuzzy line between selfishness and altruism and there is no universally agreed upon \"absolute morality\" because human beings and their institutions have different ideas about God, religion, politics and good business practices.",

   "I see why the line becomes fuzzy, but I think it is more of a problem with how we're defining our terms. In this discussion, I see selfishness pertaining more to selfish genes. All of our actions, though they seem altruistic, are centered around making sure our genetic information is passed on and as much as possible. In this sense, you might even say it is selfish to sacrifice yourself for your children. With this definition, the line becomes a little more distinct between selfishness and altruism. \n \n You still have the task of explaining why we would help out a complete stranger. I think there are two driving forces behind evolution of a species. One is species wide evolution where you help out a complete stranger to better your species as a whole and where other members of the species have the same motivational genes and would do the same for you. Another is driven by competition between you and other members of your species.

Our social instincts are tribal - not universal or global. That makes all the difference in the world and it explains a lot about politics. Just think about how easy it is to get people to rally around any cause by telling them it will benefit their families or neighbors or friends. Then float the notion around that one's friends are members of the same religion, nation, racial group or social class. We are tribal, we think in terms of what tribe we belong to and our loyalties tend to go to those who are most like us. We tend to be xenophobic toward those who are different. The true test of morality, IMO, is to transcend those inborn tendencies, but many moral codes only reinforce our prejudices. Human nature is a funny thing and I think our innate social instincts have a lot to do with mutual survival of individuals in small groups which existed before our ancestors congregated into large masses. This is the limitation of human nature which haunts us in the modern world and which challenges our sense of moral responsibility.",

   "Actually, you're the one being illogical. It is not written in stone that time is linear. There's no proof for it. Just because something is \"in our experience\" doesn't make it real.\n \n Logically, if we accept the premise that time isn't necessarily linear, then there isn't necessarily a point of origin. If there is no point of origin, then nothing need be \"created,\" since it was already there.\n\n \n Your view concerning time is arbitrary. It is based on wishful thinking. To be arbitrary is not logical. There is irony here because an evolutionist would be quick to say that a person's belief in God is arbitrary. However, as the subject of this thread indicates, we have preconditions of intelligibility that only make sense in a creation worldview. I am circling back to my original argument, however it is on this argument that I stand. \n \n Science is all about understanding how things work and through science we are able to understand what we see and experience. Science cannot explain origins but it does provide us with the necessary understanding that everything physical has a beginning. To say that \"something in our experience does not make it real\" is a disturbing and unsettling thought to say the least. If this were true how could we quantify that anything was real? \n \n \nYes, and then you have the question of who designed the designer of the designer.\n \n Theism depends on the linearity of time. It collapses without it.\n\n \n Why does theism depend on the linearity of time? Through the aid of science we can understand how things work in a physical and natural sense. But science cannot explain our origins. Science is the systematic study of the physical world through observation and experiment (this is why the \"Big Bang\" is such a farce). Science cannot provide answers for that which cannot be tested and reproduced. Science does not provide answers for origins. Theism is based on the reasonable belief that there is a Creator. The belief that there is a Creator accounts for our origins. With the creation of the universe we have the creation of time. The Creator of everything in the universe must be by nature eternal and so this Creator exists outside of time and is therefore not bond by time. \n \n \nThere is every reason to believe time existed long before the Big Bang. You have no logical reason to posit that our universe is the only universe there is, or that time is linear.\n\n \n The \"Big Bang\" is scientifically unsound according to the laws of physics. If you say that the laws of physics could change, or that they are not absolute, that would be arbitrary. Your insistence that ours is not the only universe and that time is not linear is all based on conjecture and assumption. \n \n Both you and I have presuppositions. Before I even look at the evidence I start with the presupposition found in the very first verse of the Bible: \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\" The evolutionist also has presuppositions. This is demonstrated by the fact that intelligent design is not even accepted as an acceptable and plausible cogent theory concerning origins. \n \n It's important to understand that when arguing logically it is not wrong to start with a presupposition. Mathematics does this with axioms. However, a person cannot say their presupposition is right if they cannot account for it. I account for the presupposition that a Creator created the universe due to three important conditions: absolute morality, laws of logic, and uniformity of nature. How do you account for these conditions in an evolutionary worldview? \n \n \nIt does not, because science stops at cosmology.\n\n \n Again, science does not explain origins but it does provide us with the necessary understanding that everything physical has a beginning. Cosmology is more philosophical than it is scientific. It attempts to explain origins but it cannot do it in a testable or reproducible way. \n \n \nBut your belief isn't based on knowledge. It is based on fear.\n\n \n Really? How do you come to this conclusion? If by fear you mean respect for God I can hold to that. To say that my belief is not based on knowledge is simply unfounded. My knowledge that everything created must have a creator is both logical and evidential. \n \n \nMore of your sophistry. The idea of curved space-time goes back to the early days of Einstein.\n\n \n I can assure you I have no desire to deceive anybody. And as you say, curved space-time is simply an idea.",

   "You have completely failed to demonstrate anything similar. Alternatives have been shown to you.\n \n Absolute morality:\n -it has been explained that there is no morality that is accepted as universal. Precepts you see as universalare not as universal as you would present them.\n -just because you are only willing accept a moral system backed by a supernatural entity does not mean that a moral system cannot be based on other precepts and accepted as valid. Rational thought and evolutionary traits that help form groups all offer explanations and origins for morality and legitimize moral precepts\n \n Laws of logic:\n -it has been explained that laws of logic are not ethereal entities but rather a method humans devised as a tool to perceive the environment. They exist only as a \"subprocessor\" in our heads, not on their own.\n \n Uniformity of nature:\n -uniformity of nature can only be blaimed when examining how things work in different species and is a direct link for a single origin of life. IE, that life originated as a single \"spark\" of proto life and evolution then led to diversification and made the system more complex.\n \n As for a cogent argument:\n -the human brain is a highly developed organ dedicated to perception of its environment and decision making\n -important part of the process is pattern recognition, which through complexity led to the evolution of the modern human mind\n -part of this is the laws of logic, which are one of the brain's mechanisms for assuring proper conclusions are drawn from observations (not the only ones, though)\n \n -evolution has in its course also led to the development of mechanisms that form groups of organisms. Herd instincts offer safety in numbers, parental care offers increased chance of offspring survival (and lowers the need to expend energy on procreating)\n -these have led to the development of social animals, including humans. Societies form vary in complexity\n -through teaching of offspring, what is transferred to the offspring is no longer pure genetic legacy but also social norms, mental patterns etc.\n -these norms are rationalized into morality systems. These differ, however, through time, come have converged to common patterns.\n \n -morality/law is not absolute. It is a social construct, passed on hrough parent-child relationship. Obedience (not perfect) comes from two directions: the social indoctrination that teaches the child \"this is done in this way\" and \"this is not done\", and the existence of formal or informal sanction for not obeying the norms. Contrary to popular perception, it is the first that ensures that society functions, not the second.",

   "\n So I've taken a different tact. All I ask is that you provide a cogent argument that shows how an evolutionist accounts for these preconitions to intelligibility in an evolutionary worldview.\n\n \n There is no need. We don't believe that they exist. \n \n Absolute morality has been shown to be false. While we do share common morality, this can be shown to be a product of biological evolution. This can be proven by the fact that where genetic abnormalities exist, we sometimes see a complete lack of or differences in morality. How can absolute morality exist when it depends so heavily on our biology? Someone who is totally sociopathic, a condition of the brain, does not think it is wrong to kill puppies for example.\n \n Logic is merely our way of describing cause and effect. It's based on our perception that any given circumstance will always result in a unique outcome and this will happen exactly the same every time that circumstance arises. While this may not be true, our perception is that it is true. We see the patterns and develop logic. There is no need for a precondition here since logic only requires that the world exists and we are here to observe it. No matter what the rules are, we would develop a logic to understand it. \n \n If there were no rules or the rules could change randomly, our logic would lead us to the conclusion that we cannot predict the future. Again, this is still logic. This is also related to your third precondition (not a condition of intelligibility) that these rules are constant. We don't understand the rules completely yet. We don't know why they exist. But if they didn't or they were different, we wouldn't be pondering them. Therefore, how many times could worlds have existed where nobody was there to ask this question? Again, we don't know, but to claim it has to be created is merely filling in the gaps in our lack of understanding.",

   "You have completely failed to demonstrate anything similar. Alternatives have been shown to you.\n\n \n \nWe don't believe that they exist.\n\n \n The issue is, how do you account for absolute morality, laws of logic, and uniformity of nature. These are all abstract concepts and I know that they are not tangible entities. But they are conditions necessary for intelligibility. In other words, without them we cannot make sense of the world. \n \n The ultimate question is: why do we have these preconditions to intelligibility and where do they come from? Without a Creator how can we account for them? That is my argument. \n \n Laws of logic have been discovered, not invented, because if they were invented by humanity then prior to humanity nothing was logical, which would be absurd. Uniformity of nature tells us that conditions of nature do change, but the physical laws that affect these conditions do not change. In order to do science we take for granted that the universe is understandable - that it can be quantified in a way the mind can comprehend. We assume that the universe is logical and orderly and that it obeys mathematical laws that are consistent over time and space. Even though conditions in different regions of space and eras of time are quite diverse, there is nonetheless an underlying uniformity. Morality can also be seen to be absolute, meaning that we all have a knowledge of what is fundamentally right and what is fundamentally wrong. Where does this knowledge come from?\n \n Allow me to elaborate on absolute morality. \n \n If you caught someone stealing from you (e.g., some food) and you demanded that he return what belongs to you, what would you do if he turned around and said, \"I'm starving, please let me have it.\" If you could see that he was in need of food we should all be compassionate enough to let him have the food. But what if you could see that he was not starving and was in good health and, pulling him up on this, he responds by saying, \"You can't say it would be wrong for me to take it because there are no moral absolutes.\" Now, you could say that he should not take it because it would mean you lose something that is yours and not his, but, you cannot say it would be wrong for him to take it if there is no moral absolute.\n \n I understand that people do not live to a moral absolute. That is due to the fallen nature of man. People stretch the truth and wrangle over laws. But people do assent to moral absolutes in that they know of the moral absolute. That is the point. They know of moral absolutes because morality is absolute.\n \n We know the difference between right and wrong and we know that on a fundamental level when something is wrong, it's wrong.\n \n If we could say that, yes, morality is relative; it simply would not work in society. Why? Because people would always be able to justify every single thing they did, things that are deemed by society to be wrong. The notion that morality is relative does not work in practise. If you say that people do justify the wrong they do, well, we know that very well because we all do the same at certain points in our lives. The point, however, is that people are caught and are punished according to law. They try to justify the wrong they do but they are not always successful. Why? Because there is an established law that is absolute.\n \n \nHow do we test your hypothesis?\n\n \n I do not have a hypothesis. I have what I believe is a cogent argument.",

   "\"The ultimate question is: why do we have these preconditions to intelligibility and where do they come from? Without a Creator how can we account for them? That is my argument.\" \n \n If there is a creator you can't really account for them either, except to say that some unidentifiable presence is at the root of it all. This doesn't distinguish between theism, deism or pantheism. So it tells us nothing, and it has no relation to biological evolution. So what's the point?\n \n \n \"Laws of logic have been discovered, not invented, because if they were invented by humanity then prior to humanity nothing was logical, which would be absurd.

Where does this knowledge come from?\"\n \n To a frog, the existence of something is a product of its motion because frogs cannot see what doesn't move. To the frog, the passage of time is largely an illusion because these creatures have little concept of the past or future. So maybe that chain of cause & effect, dependent on the passage of time is really as much an artifact of how our brains are wired, than it is a refection of the world itself. I wouldn't be too quick to conflate our experience of reality with reality itself. And what this has to do with the human concept of morality is equally suspect. \n \n \n \"If you caught someone stealing from you (e.g., some food) and you demanded that he return what belongs to you, what would you do if he turned around and said, \"I'm starving, please let me have it.\" If you could see that he was in need of food we should all be compassionate enough to let him have the food.

Is there an absolute code of morality that allows us to eat meat from other animals but not from humans? What does this \"absolute morality say about meat eating vs vegetarianism and who has the authority to make such moral decisions? \n \n \n \"We know the difference between right and wrong and we know that on a fundamental level when something is wrong, it's wrong.\"\n \n \n Then tell me what is right and what is wrong concerning abortion or meat eating or the the dilemma between pacifism and the doctrine of just war or extramarital sex or selling & buying sex between two consenting adults? Tell me there are no grey areas. \n \n \n \"If we could say that, yes, morality is relative; it simply would not work in society. Why?

In some societies it is considered wrong to criticize the gov't, and people actually beieve this is a matter of right & wrong. In some, homosexuality is considered a sin but it is acceptable in others. In America it is acceptible for women to work in the same occupations as men, but in some societies such a thing would be considered extremely immoral. What is absolutely understood to be wrong is very general indeed and is largely limited to major acts of violence or wholesale destruction during times of peace. There is a lot that is not universally agreed upon with respect to morality. I'm sorry to inform you that the whole concept of right and wrong is not so universally agreed upon. I hope this doesn't make your world too unstable.\n \n \n \n \"I do not have a hypothesis.
