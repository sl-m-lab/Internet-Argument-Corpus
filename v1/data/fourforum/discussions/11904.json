   "\"'Twas the night before elections, And all through the town, Tempers were flaring, Emotions up and down! I, in my bathrobe, With a cat in my lap, Had cut off the TV, Tired of political ####.When all of a sudden, There arose such a noise, I peered out of my window, Saw Obama and his boys.They had come for my wallet.\n They wanted my pay. To give to the others, Who had not worked a day! He snatched up my money, And quick as a wink, Jumped back on his bandwagon, As I gagged from the stink. He then rallied his henchmen, Who were pulling his cart.I could tell they were out To tear my country, apart! 'On Fannie, on Freddie, On Biden and Ayers! On Acorn, On Pelosi', He screamed at the pairs! They took off for his cause, And as he flew out of sight, I heard him laugh at the nation, Who wouldn't stand up and fight! So I leave you to think, On this one final note..... IF YOU DON'T WANT SOCIALISM, GET OUT AND VOTE!!!! \" McCain/Palin 08'",
