   "Wont someone simply bring up the question of whether a truly altruistic act exists?\n\n Yes they might, but it doesn't make much difference to my generalisation.\n \n An act of altruism is supposed to spring from entirely disinterested motives - let's say, perhaps, an act of \"pure mercy\". But any altruistic deed has costs and benefits that are charged to the benefactor's account. Considered from the rational benefactor's point of view, if the costs outweigh the benefits, altruism is not rational; but if the benefits outweigh the costs, there is no altruism. \n \n Since we are talking about the \"rational man\" who seeks to optimise his own happiness, it follows that he performs a generous deed only when the benefits outweigh the costs, or at least when the balance comes out even. Rationality does not admit the \"negative capability\" from which true altruism must arise.",

   "OK, what's you're definition of conservatives? (this ought to be good)\n\n OK. I see from your signature that you consider yourself an \"old school conservative\", so I'll take a shot at describing a political perspective you might share.\n \n First, I'd say that conservatism is not an ideology: it's a permanent mood, attitude, or disposition towards the world in general rather than just an outlook on politics and society.\n \n Conservatives are suspicious of change and innovation; they are (generally) pragmatists who are reluctant to \"fix \" political institutions, social conventions, the moral consensus and suchlike, which don't seem to be in need of repair. The conservative scoffs at all utopian schemes: he/she does not believe that by the power of positive law we can solve all the problems of humanity. Conservatives know that human beings are not perfectible and neither are political arrangements.\n \n What characterises a conservative disposition in politics is nothing to do with natural law, a providential order, or ethics. It is an acceptance of the current way of living combined with the hypothesis that government should be a limited and specific activity - namely the provision and custody of general rules of conduct. The essence of conservatism does not reside in any particular set of principles, but in its appeal to impenitent materialism and scepticism about the power of politicians to give effect to utopian schemes.\n \n Unlike liberalism which is always rational, conservatism is often irrational and has been associated with some of the most infamous political regimes in modern history.\n \n This is all a bit off topic and I don't know whether my attempt to \"read your palm\" will satisify you, but it's the best I can do without boring you (and myself) with piles of detail.",

   "@ Alan Ryan\n \n I find your description an interesting read and I wonder if you by \"liberal man\" mean \"modern-man-living-in-a-western-democratic-market-economy\"?\n \n And I have a few other questions\n \n \nThe goal of rationality is happiness. Whatever the contingent political, social, economic, or moral circumstances, the rational man seeks to maximise pleasure and to minimise pain. The woes of the world are of concern to the rational man - because directly or indirectly, they affect his happiness.

It pays the rational man to analyse options and calculate outcomes on the selfish basis that the net result should reduce suffering and thereby maintain or even augment his happiness. \n\n \n I take this as some sort of \"profit\" maximation where pleasure is pursued and pain is avoided. It sounds quite short-sighted and hedonistic even though I agree with the fundamentals. Would \"maximizing utility\" be a better term (sorry if I`m just picking on words)? But perhaps your point is that liberal man is short-sighted and hedonistic. Something I would agree to up to a certain point. However, I would claim that this is conflict with your assertion that liberal man is also rational. A rational analysing man would also be able to maximize utility/pleasure in long term, and one could easily imagine a liberal man pursuing not purely physical pleasure, but also more abstract goals such as power, learning, fame, respect, security, understanding, etc. \n \n I cannot help to recognize similiarities to utilitarianism. Does your description mean that we are utilitarian by nature, and behaviour based on ideas of natural or human rights are only disguised utility/pleasure maximating actions?\n \n But perhaps I`m drawing wrong paralells here. Utilitarianism is concerned with how society should be governed, and perhaps not so much about how individuals do act.\n \n \n \nThe liberal man is always rational: irrational liberalism is an oxymoron. Whatever the problem, the liberal will search for a reasoned solution : there will be no religious influence on any such solution. The appliance of science wherever appropriate, is a liberal dogma.

Public happiness on the widest possible scale is a liberal aim: the private happiness of the solitary rational individual has an interest in the success of this aim. \n \n\n \n This sounds very much like practical utilitarianism. But would it really be realistic to apply this to the individual selfish liberal man? Perhaps more realistic; given the right intitutions (like free elections, open interest organisations, free and efficient press etc) the aggregated self-interests of the \"liberal men\" will result, or come close to the maximation public happiness. (Even though I must say I`m not really convinced by this either)\n \n \n \nFor my final generalisation, I would assert that liberal people are, by definition, rational people and, whether they admit it or not, they are also selfish people because all rational behaviour is, ultimately, the self interested pursuit of happiness. \n\n \n Selfish is such an interesting term. Personally, I believe everyone are selfish. But selfishnes can manifest itself in an act of generosity and solidarity. It`s all tied to the utility the individual gets from various actions and outcomes. I get utility from being nice to my brother, I get utility from being polite to strangers and I get utility from giving alms to the poor. And this is all based on selfishnes because what I crave is utility. It is for my own sake I do all these things. But there is other \"definitions\" of selfishness as well. In economics, an often used assumption is utility/profit maximizing, selfish individuals. This assumption implies that individuals are only interested in their own utility without gaining or loosing utility based on others utility. At first glance, it doesn`t seem very realistic to me and it has been proven through experiments when so many factors as possible has been controled that the utility of others do affect our actions. But nonetheless, it is still used frequently.\n \n Sorry for geting off tangent here but there was a rather interesting study reagrding this carried out at my uni just one or two years ago. The idea was to test wether utility of others affect the individual. Two individuals where given the following rules: They would split 100 sKr (about 8 pounds) but individual nr 1 would choose how to divide the money and individual nr 2 was given the choice of either accepting the distribution and get his share or he could reject the propasal, in which case they both lost the money. The outcomes where interesting because it showed that individuals tended to accept when the other had split the money evenly like 60/40. But rejected (and forfeited their own gains) when they where presented with an uneven split liek 80/20. Women where far better than men in this case (they where both more prone to split evenly which resulted in higher earnings) and interestlingly enough, where more prone to accept less evenly split pots when it was a man who had splitted it. Looking though my own post I`m not sure if this had anything to do with the original topic... Sorry `bout that :p\n \n Edit: Oh, and the results of the above-mentioned study was that the utility of others is important as is ideas of \"fair\" shares. People where willing to give up money in order to punish someone who was to \"greedy\". As it was anounced that there would only be one game per person, it is not very likely that game-strategies where used (for example trying to deter the one who split the pot unevenly from doing it again in future games).",

   "@ Alan Ryan\n \n I find your description an interesting read and I wonder if you by \"liberal man\" mean \"modern-man-living-in-a-western-democratic-market-economy\"?\n\n Yes, by \"liberal man\" I do mean the same as in the formulation you have supplied. (If this exchange was in the German language, no doubt there would be a compound word for it !). \n \nI take this as some sort of \"profit\" maximation where pleasure is pursued and pain is avoided. It sounds quite short-sighted and hedonistic even though I agree with the fundamentals. Would \"maximizing utility\" be a better term (sorry if I`m just picking on words)? But perhaps your point is that liberal man is short-sighted and hedonistic. Something I would agree to up to a certain point.

A rational analysing man would also be able to maximize utility/pleasure in long term, and one could easily imagine a liberal man pursuing not purely physical pleasure, but also more abstract goals such as power, learning, fame, respect, security, understanding, etc.\n \n I would not object to your phrase \"maximising utility\" - but I don't agree that the pursuit of pleasure/profit utility is hedonistic and short-sighted. My proposition is that a rational calculation made concerning any political, social, or economic circumstance will (ultimately) seek to optimise happiness and minimise misery. Hedonism is the pursuit of immediate pleasure for its own sake; a hedonist is not troubled by general notions about the public interest. The liberal mind will take the long view that even slow progressive measures will deliver happiness in the end. \n \n \nI cannot help to recognize similiarities to utilitarianism. Does your description mean that we are utilitarian by nature, and behaviour based on ideas of natural or human rights are only disguised utility/pleasure maximating actions?\n But perhaps I`m drawing wrong paralells here. Utilitarianism is concerned with how society should be governed, and perhaps not so much about how individuals do act.\n\n You are correct in identifying the thick layer of utilitarianism in my description of the liberal man's behaviour. Utilitarianism is not just a theory of government since individuals can act independently on utilitarian principles and, as I have suggested, it is in the individual's rational self interest to work for the greatest happiness of the greatest number. If you gain from my liberal concern for your welfare, then I also gain from eliminating a possible source of antipathy.\n \n The existence of natural rights, from the utilitarian point of view, is \"nonsense on stilts\". However, even in the absence of \"rights\", man is still a creature of desires. A liberal man will seek to satisfy those desires/wants/needs etc. By doing so, he protects his own interests. In the last analysis, this is selfish or at best prudent behaviour. I think we should remember that the liberal man is motivated in his war on woe by the strong desire to make society (or the world) a \"better\" place. His attack on the unsatisfactory status quo is a reasoned attack: he would not disturb a situation if he knew for certain that any disturbance would leave him worse off than before.\n \n \nThis sounds very much like practical utilitarianism. But would it really be realistic to apply this to the individual selfish liberal man? Perhaps more realistic; given the right intitutions (like free elections, open interest organisations, free and efficient press etc) the aggregated self-interests of the \"liberal men\" will result, or come close to the maximation public happiness. (Even though I must say I`m not really convinced by this either)\n\n For the sake of simplicity, I have spoken only of the \"liberal man\" in the singular: obviously, the aggregated self interests of a society of liberal men must be used in the calculation of maximum public happiness. \n \nSelfish is such an interesting term. Personally, I believe everyone are selfish. But selfishnes can manifest itself in an act of generosity and solidarity. It`s all tied to the utility the individual gets from various actions and outcomes. I get utility from being nice to my brother, I get utility from being polite to strangers and I get utility from giving alms to the poor.

Your brother gains, the stranger gains, you gain: there are no losers. Happiness is spread about by your selfishness.\n \n Similarly, although the experiments in social psychology that you describe (at your university) seem to suggest that selfishness is only an option and that the spirit of altruism is not dead, the results can be explained in terms of positive feedback. The pleasure I get from keeping more than half my share of a sum of money might be less than the pleasure I should experience by \"fair shares\" and winning the esteem of other people.",

When any particular liberal policy achieves a reciprocal gain, it does so by augmenting satisfactions both individual and in society at large. \n \n No, it would not be rational to crush another's happiness, even secretly, because that would increase the sum of sorrows which the liberal is trying to reduce. \n \n \nFinally, you say that religion plays no role in deciding the liberal's actions, but obviously selfishness is served by reaching heaven if religion is believed, or even believed to be remotely probable.

   "Conservatives do indeed strive to conserve arcane and inconvenient measures, but that does not exclude them from being pragmatic in the sense that the conservative mind will focus on what can be done in the actual world rather than what ought to be done in an ideal world.\nOK, I can accept pragmatic in that sense. \n \n \nMy use of words is meant to advance a polemic, not to provide definitions. \"Happiness\", \"liberalism\", even \"rationalism\" are pretty slippery concepts and it would take too long and be too academic to define all my terms.\nI'm just wondering if they go beyond a circular definition\n \n \nI'm suggesting that the liberal mind is both rational and selfish: that the pursuit of happiness is a rational enterprise and that self interested behaviour is that best calculated to achieve happiness, whether public or private.\n You say in your first post\n 'The woes of the world are of concern to the rational man - because directly or indirectly, they affect his happiness.'\n This, and the claim of selfishness, suggest your original claim is that private happiness is the aim of the rational man (later changed to most rational men, the liberal ones), and that public happiness is merely a means to this. \n \n \nSolving conflicts is just another phrase for reducing misery. Any reduction in misery will increase the \"happiness quotient\". This could be a public benefit or, within the individual, a psychological gain - say in peace of mind. When any particular liberal policy achieves a reciprocal gain, it does so by augmenting satisfactions both individual and in society at large. \nThe fact that something benefiting society benefits the individual does not mean the same thing benefits both most. You have to decide:\n 1) the liberal is selfish\n 2) the liberal is concerned with happiness generally, i.e. as much others as himself\n 3) each individual's happiness is DIRECTLY proportioned to that of society\n \n \nNo, it would not be rational to crush another's happiness, even secretly, because that would increase the sum of sorrows which the liberal is trying to reduce.\nIn which case he isn't selfish. He's some sort of utilitarian \n \n \n \nLiberalism does not yield to theological arguments that claim suffering in this life is a passport to heaven. The whole scene is played out on a secular earth, and worldly prosperity is part of the definition of happiness which I have failed to provide. \n \n As to your final question, I will not say that it is irrational to believe in God (for it is conceivable that there is a psychological gain in doing so), I can only emphasise that lack of credible and convincing evidence makes it impossible for many people, including me, to have any religious faith.\nIf liberalism is selfish, why is its selfishness bounded to this plane of existence: surely heaven is the ultimate concern of the selfish hedonist. Unless liberalism is incompatible with religious BELIEF it cannot be incompatible with religious ETHICS",

   "@ Obvious Child:\n \n I take it as axiomatic that it is rational to seek happiness and that man is a desiring animal - avid for pleasure and averse to pain. The liberal man is perhaps synonymous with the \"intelligent observer\", with the exception of such an observer's detachment, and inspects society with a sympathetic eye. An essential in his world view is sensitivity to suffering situations; he seeks to redress grievances and if possible to alleviate or eliminate sufferings. \n \n So the liberal man wishes to make a \"better\" world for everyone. But the question arises why ? Well, his compassion is not necessarily actuated by any religious principles. It is based on the rational appreciation that through \"the relief of man's estate\", he will be among the beneficiaries.\n \n Utilitarian policies are not precluded from having selfish motives. To aim for the greatest happiness of the greatest number is not abstracted from the satisfaction of a personal need.\n \n The selfish hedonist is in private pursuit of immediate pleasures and material satisfactions here on this earth. Heaven is the destination, so we are taught, of the self-denying, the meek, the downtrodden, etc. - In other words, heaven is the reward of suffering people who accept their lot in this world in hopes of justice in another.",

   "This suggests that the total happiness comes first. What I am trying to tease out is what happens if the rational man is confronted with a choice between his happiness and others'.\n\n \n Happiness takes a myriad forms. I may have a shrewd idea, but I cannot know for certain what makes a particular individual happy. From my point of view, there are many bizarre behaviours that make some people happy, but in which I should find no pleasure. But, if I am a rational liberal man, I should not wish to put an unreasoned constraint on any human behaviour whatsoever. Impulsive or emotional objections which I might feel towards \"weird\" conduct, have no place in a rational evaluation of it. \n \n Total happiness is simply the aggregate of many individual happinesses. It is immaterial whether a measure of successful liberality is aimed at an individual or society as a whole, because the sum of it is increased in either case. The rational man is obviously a calculating agent, and as such he will make a judgment, where conflict of interest arises, that will tend to optimise the total happiness in which he participates.\n \n I have claimed that the rational liberal man desires a reduction of the misery in society (or in the world at large). It should be understood that an essential value at the core of any liberal activity that results in reducing misery and increasing happiness, should be identified as freedom. What I mean by \"freedom\" is simply the liberty of each individual to pursue his own ends without any unreasoned restraint of his behaviour or censure of his conduct by others. (Note, I qualified the use of restraint). \n \n It might appear to be a paradox, but the rational regard I have for my own interests, which by definition is selfish, promotes like the \"invisible hand\" of Adam Smith, the welfare of the world outside my own limited and vulgar perspective. \n \n Rational, liberal, and selfish might be described as the indispensable attributes of an ideal type of the modern secular human being.",
