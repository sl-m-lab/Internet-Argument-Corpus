   "I am not saying it is fair or plausible but I assume if a resistance leader drove away america by killing many american soldiers and brought a stable government then the iraqis would love them. My point is that I don't know why people suggest that the typical Iraqi thinks america is it's \"friend\". It just contradicts what I know about human nature.",

   "As far as I have seen in my years, people, as in the average Joe, dislike the rich, the wealthy, the decadent, the well off. I live comfortably in a expensive city, but I don't care for the conspicious consumption of the rich elite that trot around my town with their nose in the air, their massive diamond rings, ridiculously expensive automobiles, their maids and chauffeurs, their nannies and personal servants, with their linen table cloths and real silver dining utensils sipping capuccinos and nibbling petit fours and spackling their crackers with Beluga caviar and sour cream.

And we paid dearly for our choice.\n \n So what happens when/if Iraq settles into an anti-American tack?\n\n \n We (USA) have clearly established a two-tier society, regardless of what the foolish, dwindling middle class has long been encouraged to believe, and you do live in a city with one of the finest hotels on the West Coast, the old Biltmore (great cottages), and old, established wealth, especially in Montecito and some of the surrounding properties. Your area has been that way for many decades. It, like Beverly Hills and other concentrations of wealth in many US states and other countries, barring a natural disaster, will be there for a long, long time. If it disturbs you to the extent you voice, I suggest declining social engagements with that portion of society or relocation. \n \n I'm in agreement with the rest of your post. \n \n I think general anti-American sentiment is already there, not due to our ideology or position in the world pecking order, but simply because we are an occupying foreign military power that can't and won't be dislodged before we supposedly rectify the damage to their infrastructure and allow the new government to amass enough force to control their country. If we're unable to return the general population to a standard of living at least equal to pre-invasion infrastructure and stem resistance, growing crime and severe unemployment within a reasonable period of time (the key question) then who will the Iraq government and citizenry begin to blame for their ongoing plight but the US? \n \n It took Saddam 400,000 military troops and a large, ruthless state police apparatus plus at the time a very adequate civil police force to control three very distinct and often opposed populations sharing the same borders. What are our chances of duplicating that control under democratic ideology without creating a police state mentality, rebuilding their infrastructure and leaving Iraq before the entire country begins hating us?",
