   "So since I'm Nextel subscriber I thought about getting the new camera phone but it's going to cost me like $285 when all is said and done. So I was thinking maybe I shoud just invest in a nice digital camera that is small and compact....of course you can't take inconspicuos photos with the digital camera. Anyways what are your thoughts?",
