   "From the neocons who urge attacks on Iran, there is a deafening silence about another aggressive, nuclear-capable state - Israel\n \n In a sudden attack of common sense, a Pentagon-commissioned study released in mid-November suggests an approach to nuclear nonproliferation in the Middle East that might actually be accepted by the people of the region. What is this breakthrough idea? That U.S. policies begin not with a country that currently lacks nuclear weapons - Iran - but rather with the one that by virtually all accounts already has them - Israel. \n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=7163\n \n \n Iran Prepares to Resist US Attack\n \n With Zionist neo-cons advocating an attack on Iran, and their Israeli friends actually threatening air-strikes, the Iranian government is preparing for a possible show-down with the United States. Iran has much to fear. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was the target of an assassination attempt shortly after he questioned Western \"Holocaust\" dogma -- mere statements which have themselves been held up by Zionist interests as an actual potential causus belli -- and various international bodies, as well as the United States, have expressed \"concerns\" about the civilian nuclear energy program being pursued by Iran.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=7275\n \n \n Israel Warns of War with Iran\n \n Shaul Mofaz, Israel's Iran-born Defence Minister has threatened the Middle East with a region-wide war, merely the latest in a long series of belligerant Zionist attempts to force the United States to fight its battles.\n \n Jewish groups are also consistently misreporting Ahmedinejad's indictments of Zionist crimes as a desire to \"destroy the Jewish people.\"\n \n Israel is using Iran's civilian energy program to pretend it fears an eventual Iranian nuclear weapon. Hypocritically, Israel itself is the only Middle Eastern nation to have nuclear weapons, a fact seldom if ever mentioned in America's \"mainstream\" media.\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=7608\n \n \n Israel and US Threats Against Iran\n \n The Bush Administration and their Democratic allies believe that the war in Iraq and now Iran is in Israel's interest. \"Israel's long-term survival depends upon the spread of democracy in the Middle East,\" President Bush was quoted as saying in the Forward on December 16, 2005.\n \n Democracy by gunpoint, that is.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=7593\n \n \n \n .",

In fact, a good number of the people who are fanatically against the US are also against them. So they are more of an ally.

   "You are all correct here. Israel does have a nuclear arsenal. But, I think the Israelites are way over their heads. One, Israel is a small country. Iran is a big country. Iran also has more men. Now, I know what you are saying. Size of the military does not matter, it is just how you use them. Well, maybe the Israelites could conquer the Iranians, but I am not supportive of Israel taking on a country much more bigger than theirs. \n Only thing, I don't think Israel would use nuclear weapons to keep from being invaded. The United States and many countries are against the use of nuclear weapons unless the need is great. I think if Israel used nukes on Iran, America would be ###### off. But, I think if anyone tried to take on Israel, America would help them. \n Israel is capable of many things. Especially since we supplied them with their weapons technologies.

After all, the Hamass (Sp.) group won the election. Now I don't know for a fact but last I heard, the two were not exactly on friendly terms.

   "First of all, the Israeli military has already fought-and won-against the Arab states surrounding it. The First Palestinian War ended with a gain of about 5,000 km\u00b2 for Israel. The only reason the Sinai Peninsula belongs to Egypt and not Israel is the peace treaty signed in 1979-twelve years after Israel took control of Sinai.\n \n Secondly, the Mossad, the Israeli intellegence agency, is largely recognized as one of, if not the, best in the world. Notably, the bombing of the Iraqi nuclear program in 1982 effectively stopped the development of weapons-grade radioactive materials. Whether the Mossad will be able to pull off the same stunt in Iran is debateable, but the development of the Arrow II (anti-missle) might lead one to believe that Israel is willing to take that chance.\n \n Third, the so-called \"turf war\" has been around since the conception of the Jewish state. The UN initially tried to set up an international zone around Jeruselem, but the subsequent fighting as the Arab world attacked blew up that idea. If the problem's been around for fifty years, Why would Israel suddenly give up all other interests in order to try and solve it? The Hamas is a government in exile, without any specific land except what Israel has recently agreed to give it. Thus, they are \"in each other's back yards\" in the sense that both Jews and Palestinians live in the same area.\n \n Finally, Iran isn't really threatening to invade Israel. They are simply threatening to bomb the Dimona nuclear center, where Israel (supposedly) manufactures and keeps it's nuclear weapons. It's sort of like Area 51; Israel has never verified or denied that it has nuclear weapons. Anyways, the probability of an Iraqi victory is something the officials in each country will have to decide for themselves.",

The only reason the Sinai Peninsula belongs to Egypt and not Israel is the peace treaty signed in 1979-twelve years after Israel took control of Sinai.\n\n \n And the only reason that Israel s still around, and allowed to ship their goods, is because we pay egypt billions each year to allow it. \n \n Israel certainly fought, and lost badly. By the end of the 6 days war, they had destroyed over 80% of their military equipment PLUS billions of dollars worth of replacement equipment that we airdropped them. The egyptians, Syrians, and Iraqis had entire divisions in reserve, and Iran was mobilizing 300,000 troops to aid int eh effort. Israel would have been wiped off the map if the US had not stepped in. At the end of the conflict, most israeli units were forced to destroy their vehicles and walk back to israel becuase they had outrun their supply lines by a rediculous margin.\n \n Major time and energy has gone into studying the 6 days wars and the failure of the Israeli army. They had every advantage...modern equipment, the first strike in the war, a surpise attack that destroyed the majority fo the enemy forces, yet in the end, the war was an utter failure and the US had to step in and salvage the situation for israel.\n \n \nSecondly, the Mossad, the Israeli intellegence agency, is largely recognized as one of, if not the, best in the world.

The place was marked on most maps. The mossad had nothing to do with it.",
