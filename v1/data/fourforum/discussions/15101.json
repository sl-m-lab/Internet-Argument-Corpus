   "NASA scientist finds evidence of alien life - Yahoo! News\n \n It will be interesting to see how this turns out.\n \n What will the creationists say if it is confirmed a bacteria of some kind? (probably something stupid)\n \n There was a news story I ran into about a year ago that said when the Apollo mission went to the moon they brought back pieces of the lunar probes sent before them. They found streptococcus bacteria stuck to some of the parts and astonishingly when the parts warmed up the bacteria were alive. I don't think bacteria floating around out in space takes any stretch of the imagination, they are probably all over the universe. Could life here on earth come from somewhere else? Absolutely.",
