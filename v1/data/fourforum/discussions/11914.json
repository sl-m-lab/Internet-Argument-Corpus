Look at the UK, not guns, they turn to knives, now they want to control that...it's never going to end with this nonsense...but I tell what you will be doing and that is creating a lot more victims. The UK has a higher victimization rate than the US! That means that criminals get their way their even though they won't die, they still will be more likely to get robbed or beaten, etc. The negatives of banning something useful for self defense far outweigh the positives, therefore we shouldn't ban or make it more difficult for the law abiding citizen. \n \n Sinjin, I'm just curious.

   "Let's try this for a third time, shall we? \n \n If you want a real solution which should be attacked with fervor and one more common sense law, it is the ATF enacting the buyers transfer law, which requires anyone who buys a gun, and then sells it privately to be required to go to a gun store with the new buyer and with pictured ID. A background check must be done on the buyer before the sale is final. The gun store holds the weapon in question and delivers it to the new owner once he is approved. For this service, the gun shop receives a 25.00 transfer fee.\n \n This would prevent the practice of criminals and gangs from allowing friends, girlfriends and spouses from legally buying guns and just passing them on to the criminals who are usually already felons, what you call straw purchases. That type of system would put a huge dent in making guns available to felons and criminals who intend to use them to deny others of their civil and human rights.\n \n The point of this law would force a record of all legally purchased weapons to be made if they are being resold privately. This way, if a criminal was caught with a weapon which was legally purchased by a non felon, that person would be held legally responsible for procuring a weapon which, if used in a crime, they could be held as an accessory to. It would put teeth into the law and prevent straw purchases from taking place.\n\"Straw purchases\" are not privately resold weapons going to felons although I'm sure this happens. I have no problem with your suggestion but it still doesn't address weapons bought legally directly from dealers and then handed over to criminals. If the weapons are never resold, how do we know who has physical possession of them? Your solution only allows background checks for private transactions. After that, who knows?

What you are asking is describing a straw purchase. Here: Straw purchase - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia educate yourself. My suggestion would hold the purchaser responsible for any crime committed by the person they handed the gun over to. The only way to legally transfer the gun would be to go through the third party process I outlined which would involve a licensed gun dealer and result in a back ground check on the person receiving the weapon. It's idi*t proof.\n \n If they just ignore the law, and hand the gun over, or sell it to anyone; and the carrier gets caught with it, the legal owner can be held responsible for any crimes committed with it or at the very least, be arrested, charged and tried for illegally transferring a deadly weapon. GET IT NOW?\n \n \nUnder United States federal gun laws, a straw purchase is any purchase from a dealer holding a Federal Firearms License where the buyer conducting the transaction is not the \"actual purchaser\", but is acting as a proxy for another person. Although the term is commonly used to refer to purchasing on behalf of a person who is legally ineligible to purchase or possess a firearm, the law does not make that distinction.\n",

Offenses committed with all types of firearms, including air guns, have also increased.\n \n That's an increase of 725 gun crimes in 11 years, a 242 percent increase. Britain already had strict gun control before the 1996 Dunblane, Scotland, school shooting, and in 1997 both Conservative and Labour governments pushed through fresh gun control legislation banning small caliber handguns.\n \n Jordan did note that gun fatalities are down at just 50 deaths in the U.K. last year from 55 in 1995, yet Jordan carefully inserted a caveat earlier in the same paragraph.\n \n \"According to government statistics, the number of people killed by guns has essentially stayed the same, with dips and spikes, as before the 1997 gun control laws went into effect,\" she wrote.\n \n \"Dips and spikes?\" Perhaps like the spike in total homicides in England and Wales in the years following the 1997 gun laws? Homicides peaked at over 1,000 in the 2002-3 survey period. The number has since fallen to just above 1997-8 levels.\n \n What about the oft-repeated meme that gun-free Britain is much less violent than the United States? Jordan doesn't raise that meme per se, but neither does she compare apples to apples. Has Britain historically been less violent, more violent, or similarly violent per capita to the United States? Jordan doesn't say.\n \n The better comparison, in fact, is if Britain has become more or less violent since the 1997 gun laws.\n The notion that it's become less violent doesn't wash according to data from the British government.\n \n What about \"possession of weapons.\" Surely arrests for illegal weapons is on a downward trend, right?British Gun Crime up 242 Percent; Post Says 'Laws Seen As Curbing Attacks' | NewsBusters.org\n \n So as usual, the anti-gunners claims bely the real time evidence. What is undeniable is that gun crimes are higher than they were prior to the 97 gun ban. That's pretty solid evidence that banning guns doesn't curb either availability or gun violence, for criminals anyway.

Here are just a few (AB) Arian Brotherhood, Skin Heads, Latin Kings, Mexican Mafia, MS-13, Mongols, Hells Angles, Bloods, and Crips, just to name a few. These gangs use violence and murder as just a regular part of doing business.\nComparing countries is not entirely accurate, but it's the most accurate we're going to get for the moment. Comparing states is pretty much pointless, as there is zero state border control.\n \n Besides, charliegone brought it up, not me.\n \n \nOnly a very few countries actually have criminal rights. In most countries you are guilty till you prove your innocents, you have no Miranda rights, no right to an attorney, also in other countries you don't have a justice system where a criminal can kill someone serve 5 years and be out to kill again as in the US.\nIn the UK, you have all that apart from an incompetent criminal justice system. On the other hand, the US already imprisons almost 1% of it's population at any one time - clearly something is wrong with the system.\n \n \nFor many years various organizations in the UK have been lying on the annual crime figures in order to make Britain look like it's less dangerous than it really is, in some cases capping the total figures after a certain level.\n\n Prove it. Sounds like a conspiracy theory to me, or something blown out of proportion by the media (for example, 'gun crimes' recently went up because they decided to include gun running as 'gun crime', and the media made a big fuss).",

   "Alright, let's assume that these figures are accurate. Why isn't the ATF and other police agencies working to track down the ones that're actually stealing these weapons in the first place, rather than focusing all of their attention on the sellers and previous owners?\nHow would you propose to \"track down\" burglars?\n \n \nSurely 200,000 thefts a year would be reason for the police to get up, get out and get busy, wouldn't it? But what are they doing?\nGet busy how? Most palces you don't even have to report the theft.\n \n \nIn today's world of product and corporate liability when Ginsu needs to put a label on their knives that say \"Warning: blade is extremely sharp, do not run your finger along the edge\", you actually think the companies are disregarding the liability issues and churning out so much junk that they need to sell it out the company door to anyone they can find just to make a pound?\nThe distribution networks are legit. Many legal sales end up putting guns in the hands of felons. Nothing \"out the door\". And as long as the gun industry has a powerful lobby, manufacturer liability for misuse is unlikely.\n \n \nShoot first, rob later is already occurring even when the target isn't armed. \nBest research that.

   "\n Sorry, nope. Firstly, I'm a UK citizen who is still here, and has never been a victim of crime. Secondly, anecdotal evidence is kinda irrelevant.\n\n \n \n\n *raises hand*\n I've been the victim of a violent crime, technically. I was up in Sheffield, coming out of a nightclub with a couple of friends (we were almost all sober, before you leap to conclusions) and we turned the corner straight into a fight between 2 groups made up of about 5-6 blokes each. One of my friends asked someone nearby what was going on, and as he was being answered the fight spilled over to us and I got punched in the back of the head. If my friends hadn't been there to carry me back around the corner, I have no idea what would have happened, but as the fight was continually expanding it probably wouldn't have been good. We told the bouncers at the club, who phoned the police and told us to go home. Not exactly a thrilling end to it, but a safe one.\n \n I do not want a gun for my personal protection. Furthermore, I very strongly suspect that if one or more of the guys fighting had had a gun, there would have been a lot more than a few bruises to take care of in the morning. And I know that many other victims of assault would not want to own a gun.\n \n Don't try and project your fears onto other people, please.

   "Woah, I had to go a long way back to find that quote...\n \n What happened in Sheffield was, technically speaking, a violent assault on me - and one that did not persuade me that firearm ownership was a good thing. However, it was not aimed at me, I simply got caught up in someone else's problem. \n I guess you could technically call me an 'accidental' victim of crime, in the same way that someone who gets their parked car scraped by a ice-skidding vehicle is technically an 'accidental' victim of vandalism.\n \n EDIT: Now responding (finally, apologies for the wait!) to this post\n \nWell if you don't care about the criminal then why don't you want the potential victims empowered and enabled so they don't have to be victims? Why don't you want Castle Doctrine legislation so people who walk the streets can stomp their attackers into paste and not face prosecution\n\n When you say 'empowering', you mean 'arming'. I don't want the general public armed, because that makes it easier for someone with criminal intent to get armed.\n I said \"I don' care about the criminal in that case as a direct reply to your statement - \"By your logic being robbed is a small price to pay for not being stabbed for resisting your mugger.\" I'd agree with that - I'd rather be robbed than stabbed and then robbed - I don't care what happens to the mugger in that situation, I'm more concerned with my own life. \n I see the castle doctrine as the home-owners version of allowing vigilantism. Someone has committed a crime (in the homeowners view), and the CD promotes the homeowner doing whatever they see fit as a result. It's not the job of the individual to dispense punishment.\n \n \nOh please, 6/6 was just pure luck. Surveillance Cams Don't Reduce Crime, Study Finds - Switched\n\n \n The effects of CCTV\n \"From 18 evaluations &#8211; the other four did not provide the needed data to be included in the meta-analysis &#8211; it was concluded that CCTV had a significant desirable effect on crime\"\n \n \nNo my faith is that if my attacker doesn't have a monopoly on deployable force then the odds are more even than they would be otherwise.\nMaking guns harder to obtain will result in this reduced 'monopoly'. And there are many viable alternatives to guns as 'deployable force' as have been mentioned earlier.\n \n \nIs it better to be robbed of all your money and unable to pay your rent, or to need medical care because you got injured in successfully driving your attacker away?\nAssumption game?\n \n I simply said 'which would you rather experience - robbery without violence (more common in the UK) or violent crime (more common in the US)'. You're now putting extreme spins on both scenarios.\n \n \nWell then how about something more recent? Violent crimes are going up - Telegraph\n\n Hardly surprising. Population density is going up, too.\n \n \n And now the latest post...\n \nThat's because it doesn't. I came from a country where private legal gun ownership was largely curtailed and it didn't do a damn bit of good at curtailing crime. We've still got bad guys armed with guns, we've still got people importing and selling guns, and we've got police who can't do a damn thing about it despite the fact that the laws are all on their side.\n\n Gun crime is significantly better in the UK than the US. No-one has ever suggested that laws prevent all crime - but they do reduce it.\n \n \nSo you survive, so what? You got robbed, you got threatened, and the exact same thing is gonna happen to you again and again and again until either you die, or the person seeking to rob you dies.\n \n Just because you don't die, doesn't mean that it's alright.\n\n ...or the person trying to rob you is caught.\n \n To repeat myself from earlier - would you rather be robbed or killed? Just because you have been robbed doesn't mean that it couldn't have gone much worse for you.",
