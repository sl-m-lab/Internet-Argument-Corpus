I am currently somewhere between atheist and agnostic.\n \n On your point anout changing faiths, see my reply to steeve.\n \n EDIT: My current attitude to religion does not mean I do not recognise the role it plays in human society or that I don't have philosophical or cultural sympathy with some beliefs systems.

America is the largest concentration of Catholics in the world, currently somewhat in Vatican disfavor due to their refusal to support Vatican policy on birth control. Something about not being able to feed and care for the babies making the policy a little antiquated. Even though the Vatican refuses to comment on sexual misdeeds bankrupting many parishes and other social issues, adhering to public Vatican policy is still all important in the pecking order.\n \n The Vatican being driven by internal politics, I'd think your assessment of the final choice is accurate.
