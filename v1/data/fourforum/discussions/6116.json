   "I've always thought it is a mistake, one that Christ does for instance, to look upon the thought of doing wrong as something just as bad as the act. For instance, I can think of stealing right now and nothing will happen cause I'm not even in a position where I can steal anything. I can think rape and it won't really hurt anyone. I can even think of genocide and nothing really bad will happen. And I can have all these thoughts and yet at the same time I can do a lot of good things, even unintentionally, to other people, and that will matter, to them at least.",
