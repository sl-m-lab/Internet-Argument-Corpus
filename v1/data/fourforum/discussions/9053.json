The Romans were satisfied with bread and circus and so am I.\n\n I'm not sure if you were interpreting it that way, but the question was never intended to be a competition between the good and bad aspects. One of my goals in asking that question is to identify specifically those aspects of religion which should be addressed and countered, while identifying those aspects of religion which are harmless or helpful and need not be addressed.\n \n My concern continues to be that we do not try to \"throw the baby out with the bathwater\". To do that, one needs to know what is the \"bathwater\" and what is the \"baby\". \n \n The other practical point is that, if you take an extreme position of getting rid of all religion, then you have a miniscule chance of convincing most people given that most people are, to some degree, religious. However, if you don't make a blanket attack on their beliefs but instead concentrate only on arguing against the negative aspects, then you have a chance of being convincing and getting somewhere.

That is the very opposite of the enlightenment I used to credit you with.\n\n \n I can't imagine why you would feel that way about my stance there. Surely you know that Christians quite frequently speak in 'militaresque' terms when they talk of their faith, as very well may have been happening with the \"Jesus camp\". It normally doesn't mean they want people to literally take up arms. And why would metaphor not be a part of everyday Christian living and speaking?? Allegory and metaphor would naturally not only be merely in the Bible--it's an everyday part of life. Everytime you use an allegory in these threads you're using metaphor! And for that matter, these are two different issues--metaphor is not the same issue as saying religion is ONLY bad. And that IS your stance, because you have yet to give religion any credit for anything, or acknowledge that religion can be conducted in a good way. So it's not necessarily metaphor that's the crux of the problem I have with your stance. You say you've explained over and over that fixing the problem would result in the dissolution of religion, but what you're explaining just isn't true, necessarily. You see, merely because you've explained it doesn't mean you are right. The hole in your thinking is the idea that refusal to change one's mind is ALWAYS bad. It depends on the issue. Again, this is another case of things not being so black and white, as some think sometimes. If you want to condemn people for not changing their minds to a copernican model of the universe, that's one thing. (After all, that's a scientific issue.) It's a whole other matter to condemn people for not changing their minds on religious matters, such as whether we have a soul, or believing in God. Condemning things like that is rather silly, actually. No one should be expected to think of matters in life in such calculated ways as to put everything through that filter of rationalization. They should on issues that matter, such as that cause true harm, but not other matters. But you've been explained this now over and over, now.\n \n I think it's also noteworthy that the people here who are centrist, i.e. they are willing to see the negatives AND positives of religion, are those arguing against you. Have you stopped to notice that you're the one taking the more intolerant position here? You have yet to even acknowledge anything but the bad aspects of religion, while those of us arguing with you acknowledge both the good AND the bad. Interesting because tolererance and balance are usually the more rational way of viewing matters (and are in this case as well, IMO).",

   "Negative aspects:\n \n 1. Teaching that faith (unshakeable belief) is a virtue and should be respected.\n\n I agree that this can definitely be a negative for the effectiveness for people's search for truth about their reality. It does just lead to self-dillusion. If they were only using that confidence in deluding only themselves, then I wouldn't be as concerned. My main concern in recent times has been that they use this confidence in their belief to try to impose those beliefs on others. Such strict idiological stances squash all possibility for rational debate and can easily cause many problems from such non-use of the wisdom that comes from debate. To bring such lack of wisdom into the sphere of power can and has led in wrong and/or dangerous directions.\n \n Though I agree with you that praising faith as a virtue is dangerous since it places a confidence in that leap of faith that has no support in evidence, I do not begrudge people taking that leap of faith to begin with. I think that many people, if not most, do not feel such strong confidence in that leap of faith. That is why so many people get so defensive when their faith is challenged since they know that they do not have a strong rational arguement to present. For me, it is not generally the leap of faith which I fear but the actions of those who have unsupported confidence in that leap of faith in using that confidence to impose their views on others.",

   "I can't imagine why you would feel that way about my stance there. Surely you know that Christians quite frequently speak in 'militaresque' terms when they talk of their faith\n\n \n Oh, well, that's fine then. I mean, if this kind of thing was a one-off:\n \n \n\"I want to see them as radically laying down their lives for the Gospel. As they are over in Pakistan, in Israel, in Palistan, in all those different places...\"\n\n \n I'd be worried that some impressionable children might get the wrong idea about what their authority figures wanted of them. But since christianity habitually uses violent metaphors I can't see there being a problem.\n \n \n Everytime you use an allegory in these threads you're using metaphor!\n\n \n As an aid to comprehension, jyoshu, not as a means of tacitly endorsing violence whilst maintaining pious deniability.\n \n \nAnd for that matter, these are two different issues--metaphor is not the same issue as saying religion is ONLY bad. And that IS your stance, because you have yet to give religion any credit for anything, or acknowledge that religion can be conducted in a good way. \n\n \n If you glance back through the thread you'll notice several other posters who also didn't contribute to one side or the other, not because they had nothing to say but because those points had already been made. I added two that I see as significant. The part I've bolded, in particular, is outrageously false. Rather, I have repeatedly said that the fact religion can be practised safely is not an argument in favour of religion per se.\n \n \nYou say you've explained over and over that fixing the problem would result in the dissolution of religion, but what you're explaining just isn't true, necessarily. You see, merely because you've explained it doesn't mean you are right. The hole in your thinking is the idea that refusal to change one's mind is ALWAYS bad.\n\n \n Not at all; sometimes it's merely harmless. But it's never good. The truth of that is trivial to deduce: if it could be shown that, under certain circumstances, refusal to change one's mind despite the evidence was a good thing, that very argument would necessarily include evidence in favour of not changing your mind in that situation.\n \n \nIt depends on the issue. Again, this is another case of things not being so black and white, as some think sometimes. If you want to condemn people for not changing their minds to a copernican model of the universe, that's one thing. (After all, that's a scientific issue.) It's a whole other matter to condemn people for not changing their minds on religious matters, such as whether we have a soul, or believing in God. Condemning things like that is rather silly, actually.\n\n \n But what has made that a scientific issue? Why do we think of it as a scientific matter, rather than a philosophical or religious one? Simple: geocentricity used to be a pronouncement from faith; evidence and the willingness to accept it turned the movement of celestial bodies into a science. It is ironic indeed that you should in one breath decry black-and-white mentality, and in the next exhibit it in your artificical division of scientific and religious matters.\n \n Your apology for faith, it seems, amounts to: \"Why not just leave things as they are? Everyone's perfectly happy believing as they do now; there's nothing to be gained from rocking the boat.\"\n \n It sounds so humane, doesn't it? Yet the same argument could have been - and probably was - made in the time of Copernicus, too. How could people then have conceived of the benefits that following the scientific method would yield? We've since walked on another planet, taken the first steps towards safeguarding the future of humanity against the extinction events that befall earth on a regular - if geologically scaled - basis. The fact we even know about these catastrophes is thanks to science triumphing over the biblical dogma of a young earth. Thanks to science, we have a chance that religion would have denied us for the sake of a quiet, obedient, faithful and meteorite-terminated life.\n \n \nI think it's also noteworthy that the people here who are centrist, i.e. they are willing to see the negatives AND positives of religion, are those arguing against you. Have you stopped to notice that you're the one taking the more intolerant position here? You have yet to even acknowledge anything but the bad aspects of religion, while those of us arguing with you acknowledge both the good AND the bad. Interesting because tolererance and balance are usually the more rational way of viewing matters (and are in this case as well, IMO).\n\n \n Like you 'acknowledge' the dangers of preaching violent, militaristic metaphors to young children?\n \n Jyoshu, all I ask for is evidence. I have yet to see any indicating that religion is of unique benefit - that is to say, that faith and superstition offer us anything that reason, our innate morality, and a willingness to be persuaded cannot. If that isolates me as an extremist in your view, then I have little choice but to occupy that pigeonhole in your head. Besides, all opinions were in the minority at some point :)\n \n To touch upon one of these alleged 'benefits', we don't need religion in order to be charitable; we need to be made aware of the issues, understand them, and have a structured means of delivering aid. In the past only organisations with global reach, such as the church, could achieve such feats. Such is no longer the case, but the church's pre-existing monopoly and public perception has helped it retain its prominence. It's basically easier for a religious organisation to get charitable status (and donations) because so many people are programmed to trust them.",

It seems the only support you bring up that they are doing this is that they mention a couple of hotbed ME countries. \n \n I've been around religious meetings like this a lot. I understand exactly where they're coming from, and it's the sort of thing that people get the wrong idea about because they don't actually have a good and full picture of the whole event.

Rather, I have repeatedly said that the fact religion can be practised safely is not an argument in favour of religion per se.\n\n \n You've said that there would be dissolution of religion if the problems you've brought up were fixed. Logic says that you think there's no other outcome other than religion's dissolution if it were \"practiced safely.\" (of course it almost always IS practiced safely already, but that's what you refuse to accept, I believe.) But if I've truly given a falsehood about something you've asserted, then I apologize.\n \n \nNot at all; sometimes it's merely harmless. But it's never good.\n\n \n \"Merely harmless\"? Excellent! We're making progress here. You've now said that sometimes religion is \"harmless\". \n \n Now, how can it 'never be good' when people are given aid and shown compassion? These are things that come out of religion all the time. Now, what you say is true that those things can also come out of non-religious reasons as well sometimes, we aren't arguing that. You're saying that religion is \"never good\" and I know for a fact that's just not true.\n \n And yet, even if it were true that it's never good but sometimes merely harmless, then that would be good enough based on the fact that it's not always bad. We generally don't impose or discourage on issues of peoples' behavior when that behavior is harmless just because it happens to not have specific \"good\" involved.\n \n \nBut what has made that a scientific issue? Why do we think of it as a scientific matter, rather than a philosophical or religious one? Simple: geocentricity used to be a pronouncement from faith;\n\n \n Do you really think whether humans have a soul or not could ever be scientific issue? Or whether or not we need atonement? How about whether there is a metaphysical place called heaven? I think there are some things that can't really become scientific, because they are, by their very nature, subjective and metaphysical. Some things, like the orbits of plants are observable. Some are not--such as whether we have a soul or whether God truly exists. We can (and did) truly disprove the Ptolemaic model of the universe because it was disprovable. The existence of God is not disprovable (or provable). Your argument is basically that, because some things were disprovable, all religion is (and will be) disprovable. And that's a non-sequitor. The problem with the geocentricity issue for the church is that the church was taking a scientific issue (observable and disprovable) and trying to make it an issue of faith. This was a wrong approach to begin with anyway, because faith didn't need belief in a Ptolemaic universe model. it was a case of taking a scientific issue and unnecessarily turning into a faith issue. Another example of this that still goes on today is when people take the Genesis creation story of a 6 day event literally (and even sometimes creating a whole pseudo-science around it). \n \n Now I'll grant you that some of these issues, like creation as a literal 6 day event, start as religious because they had no other way to answer them. But I really do think there are some issues that fall outside of proveability/disproveability. It's not that they haven't been observed, it's that they are not observeable. We're speaking of things that are of spiritual and metaphysical significance only.\n \n \nYour apology for faith, it seems, amounts to: \"Why not just leave things as they are? Everyone's perfectly happy believing as they do now; there's nothing to be gained from rocking the boat.\" It sounds so humane, doesn't it? Yet the same argument could have been - and probably was - made in the time of Copernicus, too.\n\n \n Again, you're speaking in huge generalizing swaths here. Religion involves a lot of issues, and it always depends on the issue. Geocentricity violated what was eventually observed. (It was an observeable matter!) Tell you what, if you can observe something that tells definitively that humankind doesn't require atonment for sin, I'll concede on that matter. If you can SHOW me something observable that settles the issue of a metaphysical soul of humans, I'll be happy to concede. These are issues that are philosophical and spiritual in content, not scientific. It's like you're trying to use a magnifying glass as a hearing aid. \n \n \nJyoshu, all I ask for is evidence. I have yet to see any indicating that religion is of unique benefit - that is to say, that faith and superstition offer us anything that reason, our innate morality, and a willingness to be persuaded cannot. \n\n \n That's fine. I'm not asking you to believe, or be persuaded. I really am not out to prove religion to you. But you're the one taking the proactive stance here of saying religion should be discouraged--which is what I take issue with. You are more than free to go on disbelieving in religion as a good thing, of any unique benefit. But don't meddle in peoples' beliefs and views that aren't yours in cases where no harm is being done. You've said by your own admission above that religion is \"sometimes merely harmless.\" So I know for a fact (based on your own words) that you realize religion can indeed be a harmless thing. Yet you are discouraging ALL religion even after admitting it is sometimes harmless. If your stance is now that only religion that's harmful should be discouraged, then you're coming in line with what I'm saying. Of course religion that can be shown as harmful should be discouraged. But not all religion.",

   "So because she mentioned Pakistan and Israel you assume they are promoting these kids to take up violence?? It seems the only support you bring up that they are doing this is that they mention a couple of hotbed ME countries.\n\n \n I think it was actually the 'radically laying down their lives' bit, in conjunction with the words 'as they are over in', and then the countries you mention, that tipped me off. I find parsing the whole sentence makes it ever so much easier to appreciate its meaning.\n \n \nI doubt I'll be able to convince you of that because you've gone into the siutuation with preconceived notions, I believe.\n\n \n jyoshu, you're a christian. If that doesn't arm you with preconceived notions about what goes on in christian meetings - christian meetings you didn't attend either, I might add - what does?\n \n \nI don't believe the \"Jesus camp\" was \"tacitly endorsing violence whilst maintaining pious deniability\" either.\n\n \n Well, no, you wouldn't, because that conflicts with your personal interpretation of christianity. Which, as you've acknowledged, is only one of many interpretations.\n \n \nYou've said that there would be dissolution of religion if the problems you've brought up were fixed. Logic says that you think there's no other outcome other than religion's dissolution if it were \"practiced safely.\" \n\n \n Where in your logic are you making the leap from 'fixing the problem' to 'practising religion safely'?\n \n The problem is faith. I keep saying this over and over but it doesn't seem to register. The problem with teaching someone to believe in god no matter what isn't the 'believing in god' part, it's the introduction of the notion that 'no matter what' is a good way to think.\n \n That lesson isn't necessarily explicit, either. Emotional blackmail plays its part too: imagine what your friends and family would think if you announced you had become an atheist. Tying beliefs to your emotions and those of your loved ones adds buttresses to the god-wall. Preaching irrationality isn't the only way religion discourages adherants from actively challenging their beliefs.\n \n If you can explain to me how a religion can cease to teach that faith trumps reason, and cease to tie the acceptance of certain irrational beliefs with acceptance within your peer group, and still remain a religion, be my guest.\n \n \n\"Merely harmless\"? Excellent! We're making progress here. You've now said that sometimes religion is \"harmless\".\n\n \n No, jyoshu, I said that on some occasions the refusal to change one's mind causes no harm, not that being predisposed to refuse can be inherently harmless.\n \n To avoid this misunderstanding I suppose I ought to have explained the precise circumstances I was envisaging, namely that the person holding the belief never encounters a situation where changing his mind would be beneficial. One can unswervingly believe that the moon is made of cheese, for instance, and never come to harm unless one decides to take a trip there without packing lunch. The predisposition to adopt unshakeable beliefs, on the other hand, is dangerous because it makes no distinction between the good, bad, or merely silly.\n \n \nNow, how can it 'never be good' when people are given aid and shown compassion? These are things that come out of religion all the time.\n\n \n But they do not require religion in order to be given. As I've already said, if I'm not allowed to criticise religion for the bad things done in its name, you can't defend it by pointing out the good things done in its name either. \n \n \nYou're saying that religion is \"never good\" and I know for a fact that's just not true.\n\n \n I'm saying that religion is never uniquely beneficial. Do religious people do good things? Sure; after all, they're people. On what grounds are you crediting religion itself with those good deeds? Association is not causality. Then there's the perceived monopoly the church had on charitable acts, from times when only the church had the breadth and depth of reach to connect generous people with those in need of help. That strongly influences where people will turn if they feel the urge to help out.\n \n \nAnd yet, even if it were true that it's never good but sometimes merely harmless, then that would be good enough based on the fact that it's not always bad. We generally don't impose or discourage on issues of peoples' behavior when that behavior is harmless just because it happens to not have specific \"good\" involved.\n\n \n Again you're confusing the holding of harmless beliefs with the harmful disposition to hold fast to beliefs in the face of evidence.\n \n \nDo you really think whether humans have a soul or not could ever be scientific issue?\n\n \n I'm not even sure you understand the question you're asking. 'Scientific' means informed by evidence; in that sense anything can be a scientific issue if we so choose.\n \n Do we have a soul? No; not in any accepted sense of 'have'. \n \n Even something not directly detectable can be inferred via its interactions with things we can observe. Since your definition of 'soul' amounts to 'something we can't ever detect', then it follows that our 'soul' cannot interact with observable reality in any way that would be distinguishable from a soul not being present. Ergo it is something we can't have.\n \n If, on the other hand, the presence of a soul is indirectly detectable, then is it clearly a scientific issue.\n \n \nOr whether or not we need atonement? How about whether there is a metaphysical place called heaven? I think there are some things that can't really become scientific, because they are, by their very nature, subjective and metaphysical.\n\n \n Something cannot be both subjective and metaphysical, since metaphyisical implies imperceptible, and subjectivity relies upon perception. The word you're looking for is imaginary.\n \n \nBut I really do think there are some issues that fall outside of proveability/disproveability. It's not that they haven't been observed, it's that they are not observeable. We're speaking of things that are of spiritual and metaphysical significance only.\n\n \n And what significance is that, exactly?\n \n The space of undisprovable intangibles is ram-packed with nonsense, from which god and souls are indistinguishable. Our ability to conceive of them, to say 'What if...?' is meaningless. What exactly is 'spiritual significance', when 'spiritual' itself is defined entirely in terms of imaginary constructs?\n \n \nIt's like you're trying to use a magnifying glass as a hearing aid. \n\n \n Why is it anything like that? A hearing aid improves a demonstrable, measurable faculty. \"A bucket to catch a leprechaun\" would be a far better analogy.\n \n \nYou've said by your own admission above that religion is \"sometimes merely harmless.\" So I know for a fact (based on your own words) that you realize religion can indeed be a harmless thing.\n\n \n Just to reiterate: what you are saying is false: my opinion is that some beliefs held by religious people happen to be harmless, not that religion (the elevation of faith over reason and the deliberate entanglement of irrational beliefs with social acceptance) can be or is harmless.",
