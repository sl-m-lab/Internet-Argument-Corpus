   "Oklahoma's antigay Adoption Invalidation Law repealed \n \n A federal court on Friday struck down an Oklahoma law that would have had the potential to make children adopted by same-sex couples in other states legal orphans when the families are in Oklahoma. The Adoption Invalidation Law, hastily passed at the end of the 2004 Oklahoma legislative session, had said that Oklahoma \"shall not recognize an adoption by more than one individual of the same sex from any other state or foreign jurisdiction.\" \n In a 31-page decision, the court ruled that the statute violated the U.S. Constitution by singling out a specific group for discrimination. In the court opinion, U.S. district judge Robin Cauthron wrote, \"The very fact that the adoptions have occurred is evidence that a court of law has found the adoptions to be in the best interests of the children.\" \n \n \"Gay and lesbian parents in Oklahoma can now breathe a collective sigh of relief because their relationships with their children are no longer threatened by the state of Oklahoma,\" said Ken Upton, senior staff attorney for the gay group Lambda Legal, which brought the case against the state. \"We're gratified that justice has been handed down in our case and that the court saw to it that Oklahoma has to treat the children of gay and lesbian parents the same as all other kids.\" \n \n Among the plaintiffs represented by Lambda in the case were Ed Swaya and Greg Hampel, who live in Washington State and adopted their 3-year-old daughter, Vivian, after she was born in Oklahoma. The two men made news when the state of Oklahoma initially refused to issue an amended birth certificate that accurately reflected both men as Vivian's parents after a court in Washington issued an adoption decree. Before the Adoption Invalidation Law was passed, the Oklahoma State Department of Health issued Vivian's correct birth certificate, but before Friday's ruling Swaya and Hampel still were fearful about bringing Vivian to Oklahoma to visit her birth mother and see the state where she was born.

   "That has to be the most assinine law I've heard! You're a perfectly happy family until you happen to drive through Oklahoma, and then all of a sudden bang! You don't have parents any more! If anyone can track down the actual decision that put this thing to rest I'd like to see it, because I have to imagine that the judges tore the legislature a new one over this. Can anyone really doubt that homophobia desperately needs to be fought when state legislatures are willing to tear families apart in its name?",
