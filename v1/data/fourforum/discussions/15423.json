   "No one said they didn't really exist. It's not fascinating at all. This is standard self-loathing, self-repressed defense mechanism stuff---\n \n &#8220;Homosexuality came easy to me, because I was already weak,&#8221; he wrote in the opening line of an article for the far-right Web site, WorldNetDaily.com. He went on to renounce his work at XY and Y.G.A. &#8220;Homosexuality, delivered to young minds, is by its very nature pornographic,&#8221; he claimed. In a second WorldNetDaily article a week later, he said that he was &#8220;repulsed to think about homosexuality&#8221; and that he was &#8220;going to do what I can to fight it.&#8221;\n \n Then there was the whole \"I am straight\", \"homosexuality=death\", nonsense. And God is his master, not any man. What a false choice he presents. People don't need to surrender to imaginary masters, unless they are self-denying, religiously obsessed, ex-gays. Slavery equals strength and freedom? No way.\n \n All his time is spent attacking gays with obviously self-loathing rhetorical propaganda. You're never satisfied if you are being gay he says? That's because he's always trying to repress himself. Being gay isn't a addiction. This ex-gay doesn't seem happy at all. \n \n Thanks for yet again, confirming our opinions on ex-gays, jyoshu.",

What exactly is a sexual orientation?\n \n I have even wondered if I am unique for not inherently knowing. I have to admit my working hypothesis is that the seeds for any 'orientation' exist within all of us in the form of abstracted sexual attraction machinery in the brain and that what someone 'is' is what they have allowed themselves to consider, i.e. it is defined by the borders on sexuality that are constructed.\n \n This hypothesis would predict that the most common would be heterosexuality, not only because of societal forces but because there are more primitive attraction systems working under the cover than the abstract ones. However every once in a while by some thought process or event alternate 'fuel' can be fed into the mechanism producing alternate attractions.\n \n That is every once in a while someone is a deviant. The most important part of the hypothesis however is the fact that as some deviation becomes more accepted it will become more common as it will be less likely that societal impressions construct the walls. The other major prediction is that instances of deviation cannot be tracked in any significant way to genes as it is an emergent mental property. i.e. all deviations possible will occur in all societies and ethnic groups.\n \n My best pieces of evidence for this are the bi-sexuals and the bestiality people, both of which by definition do not claim to have some overpowering inherent and specific sexual attraction which dictates their behavior; and so my greatest interest in exploring this theory is the differences between these and the 'two party system' most ascribe to.\n \n I am especially interested in any moral demands made by anyone, as I believe it is such values or anti-values that define the borders of an 'orientation'.\n \n \nDo your refer to an absolute morality?\n\n Of course, I still can't suppress a small smile when that question is posed. It sounds like this to me \"You mean you do not refer to some arbitrary set of rules you happened to accept on whim without any particular reason besides emotional forces you can't understand presumably flowing from your personal history made you 'feel' that way\".\n \n If it isn't objective an absolute, why even call it morality? I mean seriously as far as I can tell the only thing that gives all the defunct irrational competitive ethical theories definition is an emotional response of condemnation and revulsion to make something 'bad' and admiration and respect to make some thing 'good'.\n \n Yes those emotions go with bad and good but the causality is flowing the wrong way in that world, little wander then that it's hard to make any moral argument from subjectivism when all you got is your emotion vs theirs. In fact from that analysis it is eminently predictable that people will construct their arbitrary emotion driven ideas of right and wrong, hold on to them through the philosophical tool of subjectivism and never let go. A thousand arbitrary directions for a thousand arbitrary emotional histories, and someone can wonder why people don't just 'get along'?!\n \n The greatest irony of all of course is what someone in this situation may mistake for enlightenment, the rejection of the personal arbitrary morality for a kind of free-floating dynamic state of non-judgement where you have transcended your individual emotions and no longer care to think of anything as moral or immoral for any reason. Ah but I have told a falsehood, there is a greater irony; when someone in such a state of 'enlightenment' proceeds to mistake an objective ethical theory for another arbitrary emotional mess based solely on the fact that it makes moral claims at all. Indeed they cannot even comprehend the concept, becoming confused and dazed when their search for the authority which instantiated the morality from it's unsupported dictates fails.",

That's not the important point.\n \n \nPersonally I'd rather he tell the truth about his experiences than pretend differently as you apparently would want him to--which would be a fake compassion. Wouldn't you want the same levity to be extended to people of your experiences?\n\n \n It's not all relative. We shouldn't coddle something that can be shown to be negative, as this ex-gay acting out thing is. It's not doing anybody a service.",

   "His experience is one of attacking his own inner gay person, as he sees it represented in others. No one is forcing him to say negative and inaccurate things about gay people, which are harmful to how gays are perceived in this society. He chooses to.\n\n \n If his experience is thus, you'd prefer him to impose his own gag order? That certainly doesn't seem right. His experience is quite on par with other ex-gays I've read. It's pretty consistent. I know you don't like his experiences because it doesn't fit your political agenda, but he shouldn't be discouraged from sharing them anymore than you.",
