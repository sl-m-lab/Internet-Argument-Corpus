   "This is a pretty good article about John Edwards. Every time I listen to that man, I feel \n \n like he's trying to sell me something that doesn't work. God help this country if he ever \n \n gets elected.\n \n The title is \"The Truth About Sen. John Edwards\n \n Link: http://politicallyright.com/article165.htm\n \n Quote: \"I must give Senator John Edwards his due: the man is a phenomenal public speaker. He \n \n could have been a sideshow huckster, or a salesman of 80 proof Indian elixirs in dry \n \n counties.\n \n For instance, he once claimed to channel the spirit of a child. 'I feel her, I feel her \n \n presence,' he said in a malpractice lawsuit on behalf of Jennifer Campbell. 'She's inside me \n \n and she's talking to you. And this is what she says to you. She says, I don't ask for your \n \n pity. What I ask for is your strength. And I don't ask for your sympathy, but I do ask for \n \n your courage.'\"",
