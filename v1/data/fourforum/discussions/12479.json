   "China ?Super Currency? Call Shows Dollar Concern (Update1) - Bloomberg.com\n \n \nMarch 24 (Bloomberg) -- China's call for a new international reserve currency may signal its concern at the dollar's weakness and ambitions for a leadership role at next week's Group of 20 summit, economists said.\n \n Central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan yesterday urged the International Monetary Fund to create a \"super-sovereign reserve currency.\" The dollar weakened after the Federal Reserve said it would buy Treasuries and the U.S. government outlined plans to buy illiquid bank assets \n\n \n Not surprisingly, Paulson and Bernanke object strongly.\n \n A UN panel recently came to much the same conclusion...that a new reserve currency needs to be created in order to ensure world wide economic stability or, in other words, ensure that the imminent failure of the United States does not drag the rest of the world down. \n \n The Russians have been advocating a similar measure for years. With the Chinese on board, it is very likely that the Japanese will agree since to them the alternative is likely to be the emergence of the yuan as a regional reserve currency.

   "5% of GDP? When you factor in unfunded federal liabilities it is more like 5x GDP. \n \n I can not imagine a more uncertain environment when it comes to our currency and ultimately the fate of our government. As you point out, the statements today DIRECTLY and LITERALLY contradict the statements made yesterday. \n \n As of right now, I would say there is about a 50/50 chance that the US will be a third world country next year, and the odds increase after that. It all lies on whether or not the dollar gets dumped anytime soon as the worlds reserve currency. \n \n The thing is, all it would take is a couple of major players to make it happen. If, for example, the Chinese, Russians, and either a few oil exporters or a Brazil decided they were going to create a joint reserve currency to replace the dollar, everybody who is holding dollar reserves would pretty much HAVE TO sign on. The tricky thing there is that they could make that transition without taking any kind of hit to their current holdings. All they have to do is decide (or create) an issuing agency and then announce that you can trade $1 in reserves for 1 trade dollar (note RESERVES) until X date. The issuing agency would take their dollars and hold them in trust until the specified date, then sell/dump them. The dollar would be absolutely destroyed, but the countries in question would retain their reserves at value and since we are talking a fiat currency here, nobody has actually lost anything. \n \n Countries who oppose the move would have no choice but to participate because otherwise when the conversion date closed and the issuing agency dumped those dollar assets, their reserves would be destroyed.",

   "Interesting discussion. Even if SDR's became the new world reserve currency it would not be in any major country's interest to see an excessive depreciation of the Dollar. The US is to valuable a customer that no one wants to lose. \n\n \n We are becoming less valuable as a customer by the day. \n \n There are some important things that people need to take into account when they are calculating our value as a customer. The first, and probably most important, is the level of consumer debt in the US. We keep hearing about the credit crunch and how we need to take all kinds of drastic steps to restore the flow of consumer credit, but in truth we have NOT seen consumer credit shrink yet. It is still growing, but at about half the pace it was prior to the economic crash. Even with consumer credit still growing in the US, Japans exports have tanked and Chinas exports have fallen dramatically. \n \n What central bankers and business leaders in those countries realize (and what people who are really on the ball in this country realize) is that consumer credit in the US WILL be shrinking, and almost certainly dramatically. Even if nothing else goes wrong and we see the negative factors in our economy turn around tomorrow, there has been a systemic adjustment to the way we estimate risk. Bankers finally woke up and realized that giving crack whores $25,000 loans was a BAD IDEA. \n \n Right NOW, we are still seeing expansion of consumer credits, primarily in credit cards, because consumers are using lines of credit that already existed prior to that adjustment, but the days of a freelance writer with no visible income walking into Lowes, filling out a credit app that fits on a notecard, and picking up a $10,000 credit line are OVER. The days of lending people who make less that $40,000 per year $45,000 to buy an F-250 are OVER. \n \n That credit squeeze...the REAL one that is going to make itself apparent as people approach the limits of their already existing credit lines, is going to have a MASSIVE negative impact on the US economy. How massive? If you could tell me that, I could make you a very, very wealthy man by the end of the week. Nobody can really say for sure. Anecdotal evidence suggests that credit application rejections are up over 25% due to the tightened credit standards. Is it reasonable to assume that is indicative of a 25% reduction in consumer credit in the future? I really dont know. What we DO know is that as far as the consumer goes, the credit crunch has not even arrived yet, but it inevitably WILL, and when it does it will make what has happened so far look relatively tame to the man on the street. Multi trillion dollar losses in the stock market and financial industries do not actually have much impact on the guy at home. A shrinkage in consumer spending DOES. \n \n That is going to have a MAJOR impact on our usefullness as consumers, especially when considered in light of the second limiting factor there, which is that basically in order to keep us as consumers, these other countries have to fund our operations. We are rapidly approaching the point where it will simply no longer be profitable for these countries to continue to finance our operations even if they wanted to.\n \n I dont think that people realize that the US is the only place on the planet where people still seem to believe that the US will be a world power in 5 years. WE have trouble coming to term with the fact that these other countries are not going to continue supporting us forever. The minute that we cease to be profitable, we become worthless, and that minute is fast approaching and in some cases is already here. \n \n \nDaewoo, could you amplify your statement in post #5 about Dollars held in trust until a specified date being dumped/sold. Dumped on whom, and exchanged against what currency or currencies?\n\n \n IT is all speculation at this point. Obviously a new trade currency is going to be based on a basket of currencies. Whether the dollar is even in there or not will depend largely on how the rest of the year works out when it comes to moving our treasuries. We had an auction today that did not go real well both because they brought a lower price than expected and because for the most part the indirect bid showed that foreigners were conspicuously absent from the table. It is MARCH and we have not quite sold off 25% of the bonds we have to move this year. If todays auction was any indication, by november they will be yielding 95%.\n \n So, you have your countries that are holding reserves agree on what the new currency will be. Frankly, contrary to the appearance Geithner was trying to put forth today, we dont get a say in it because we have no reserves. So, they decide on the currency basket for the reserves. The Chinese seem to be indicating that they would like to see the yuan in there, and as the worlds manufacturing powerhouse that makes sense. Obviously they would have float it. The Euro is a no brainer. I think that the Ruble is a likely candidate because while Russia has had some economic problems in the past, they seem to be fairly functional and stable now, and for all intents and purposes their currency is backed by their natural resources. The yen is also a likely candidate. \n \n They decide the composition of their basket, set an exchange rate for the dollar for the purposes of the new currency, and everybody trades their dollar reserves in for the new currency. The dollars are held in trust until the exchange window closes. Not just cash dollars, but dollar assets as well. As soon as the window closes, they start liquidating. They use dollars to buy the currencies that they have decided on as a basket. They dump trillions in treasuries and agency debt on the open market. \n \n Obviously the dollar is going to tank almost immediately and be trading on the wrong side of the peso by the end of the week. This means that there is no way the issuing organization for the new currency is going to be able to buy enough yuan, rubles, yen, and Euros to back the currency they issued. That is not as big a problem as you might think. They just have the issuing countries for the currencies in question print them up for them. They end up 800 billion euros short, the ECB just creates it out of thin air and hands it over to them. In general that kind of massive cash injection would have a dire inflationary impact, but you are talking RESERVES here, not money in circulation, so it would have no inflationary impact. You also have to keep in mind that in printing that they would not be attempting to generate new wealth via the printing press, but rather to provide a direct replacement for the dollar wealth that was just destroyed.\n \n Brutal? Absolutely. I think that Americans are going to have to learn a hard lesson in short order here, and that is that money has no friends and no loyalty. I am sure we have all heard the saying \"If you owe the bank a little money they own you, if you owe them a lot of money, you own them\". That is true to some extent, but what is absolutely true, no exceptions, is that no matter how much you owe the bank if they decide you are a hopeless deadbeat they WILL dump you and then try to salvage what they can. \n \n As things currently stand, the US is literally operating the largest ponzi scheme in history. The odds of an eventual default on our outstanding debt is 100%. Our creditors are well aware of this and are not going to stand idly by and watch the value of their hard earned reserved drop to zero.",

Don't any of you ###### understand that the time for \"us vs them\" is long gone? \"Your\" guy is not a god, and \"their\" guy is not the devil.

Simone started it.emoticon_xclown\n \n JK. Seriously, though, our politicians are sell outs. They'd sell us out to China as slaves if they could, that includes both Democrats and Republicans. I think the only way to truly change the US is through drastic measures, but that is never going to happen. People are more concerned about their plasma tv's, blackberries, etc. They can give care less about how their government is totally sticking it to them.",

   "I have been watching statements on this from various sources, and I think it IS going to happen. At this point it just seems to be a matter of working out the details. Heidemarie Wieczorek, Germanys minister for economic cooperation, just came out and said that the idea still needed some work (to be fleshed out) but that it is gaining momentum and is likely to come to fruition in some form.\n \n The political battle is already being fought. The pro new currency group is using some interesting tactics, like saying that it is \"Unfair\" for the US to have to worry about having to provide currency for the entire world, or that it is \"unreasonable\" to expect the US central bank to both manage domestic monetary policy and effectively manage policy for trillions in reserves all over the world. \n \n Of course, in reality, the fact that the dollar IS the worlds reserve currency has given us the ability to print literally trillions of extra dollars and since they were tied up as reserves, we did not have to worry that much about inflation. Frankly, if the dollar loses its status as the worlds reserve currency, we may not last a year without our government collapsing.",
