Gobitis dealt with the issue of expelling a student for failing to follow the Pledge of Allegiance, Barnette later overturned this by ruling that the Pledge qualified as speech and that the government compelling someone to exercise speech is a violation of the 1st Amendment regarding free speech, as it can't be free speech if it's governmentally mandated.\n \n Of Wolf and Mapp I believe Mapp was the correct ruling. Wolf dealt with an individual who's 4th Amendment rights were violated but his conviction was upheld because of illegally obtained evidence. Mapp overturned this by ruling that evidence seized by the authorities without a search warrant is inadmissible in a trial as it was obtained illegally.\n \n Now, if you don't like the Supreme Court ruling then that's just too bad for you, join the club and deal with it. Maybe it'll be overturned at a future date, but until then you have to live with the fact that gun ownership is an individual right and not connected to service in any sort of military group, and that the banning of an entire class of firearms is unconstitutional.\n \n If you're so worried that somebody might shoot you, then move to a quieter neighborhood or quit doing things that would warrant concern and possibly the use of deadly force.

Barnette ruled that the government compelling someone to speak under threat of force or violence was unconstitutional and violated the right of free speech. Mapp ruled that the 4th Amendment applied to all searched and seizures and that evidence obtained in an illegal manner can't be used. All of these cases supported rights and freedoms rather than tearing them down, that's why I believe they're the correct ruling.\n \n I'm still waiting for you to list those historic anti-gun quotes.

   "On the other hand, many in the elite held the belief that more guns\n equaled more to fear. Poor whites might put such weapons to an\n incorrect, class-based use that could disrupt or destroy the new\n nation. Senator Rufus King warned his colleagues in 1790 that \"it\n was dangerous to put Arms into the hands of the Frontier People for\n their defense, least they should Use them against the United States.\"\n \n As the early American political scholar Benjamin Oliver wrote in\n 1832, the \"cowardly and disgraceful\" act of carrying concealed\n weapons transformed what might have been a barroom brawl into a\n deadly encounter. The Second Amendment, which Oliver held\n relevant only to the militia system, offered nothing \"to prevent\n congress or the legislatures of the different states from enacting laws\n to prevent citizens from always going armed.\" Most state legislators\n agreed with Oliver's interpretation.\n THE SECOND AMENDMENT IN ACTION\n \n those quotes are just a few of many antigun quotes of the founders\n\n \n I have read the Bellesiles article before Brady. Rufus King was a founder. He represented Massachusetts in the Continental Congress and was part of the Constitutional Convention before he ultimately became a Senator in the new nation.\n \n I went back and looked at the article. I note that Bellesiles does not cite or properly attribute the quote you picked for Rufus King. Do you know where he got it from? Do you have anything to offer from King on guns, or for that matter, the 2nd. A., which can be legitimately sourced?\n \n As for Benjamin Lynde Oliver, I am familiar with him as well. Scalia has previously quoted him in an opinion regarding the 8th. Amendment. Oliver was born Sept. 14, 1788. That would make him 9 months old when Madison introduced his Bill of Rights to the convention. Is there a lost speech of Oliver's urging either acceptance/rejection/modification of the amendments? It would be short, for at nine months old he would truly have been a man of few words.\n \n I have roundly criticized Bellesiles before. However, let me point out here that the error of claiming a 9 month old was a founder of my nation was Brady's and not his. \n \n Brady, you suggest there are many anti-gun quotes from \"founders.\" Is this all you have?\n \n ---\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928), Justice Brandeis, dissenting.",

   "Hey Ozzy! If guns are responsible for all these deaths, then why do you want the owners arrested? Why not arrest the guns?\n \n ~ Ethmi asking the question that Brady and Ozzy can't answer; and probably won't try to either.\n \n \nOn the other hand, many in the elite held the belief that more guns\n equaled more to fear. Poor whites might put such weapons to an\n incorrect, class-based use that could disrupt or destroy the new\n nation. Senator Rufus King warned his colleagues in 1790 that &#8220;it\n was dangerous to put Arms into the hands of the Frontier People for\n their defense, least they should Use them against the United States.&#8221;\n\n \n Cite something.\n \n \nAs the early American political scholar Benjamin Oliver wrote in\n 1832, the &#8220;cowardly and disgraceful&#8221; act of carrying concealed\n weapons transformed what might have been a barroom brawl into a\n deadly encounter.\n\n \n I expect the full quote next time, but for now I'll let it slide. This was for cultural reasons; back then open carry was the practice. He wasn't against carrying a weapon; more so, he was saying something like \"If you have to hide your gun then you're a coward because you depend on underestimation and the element of surprise to win a fight.\" This doesn't support you, and due to some laws, open carry is no longer an option.\n \n It is also interesting to note that, as Bryan pointed out, Oliver was born in early September, 1788. He must have got into politics pretty early.\n \n \nThe Second Amendment, which Oliver held\n relevant only to the militia system, offered nothing &#8220;to prevent\n congress or the legislatures of the different states from enacting laws\n to prevent citizens from always going armed.&#8221; Most state legislators\n agreed with Oliver&#8217;s interpretation.\n THE SECOND AMENDMENT IN ACTION\n\n \n It seems that somebody omitted \"nothing\" from that quote. :) Also, who are \"Most stat legislators\"? When your side provides quotes, you always seem shy about specifying.\n \n \nthose quotes are just a few of many antigun quotes of the founders\n\n \n Then surely you'd have no problem presenting the vast abundance of the other quotes, would you? :)",

   "\"To suppose arms in the hands of citizens, to be used at individual discretion.... is to demolish every constitution, and lay the laws prostrate, so that liberty can be enjoyed by no man; it is a dissolution of the government. The fundamental law of the militia is, that it be created, directed and commanded by the laws, and ever for the support of the laws.\"\n --John Adams, A Defense of the Constitutions of the United States 475 (1787-1788) \n \n Enough said.\n\n \n Well, sure is \"enough said\" for a rabidly anti-gun rights agent with a strong desire to selectively edit a quote to deceive. \n \n Let's examine the entire quote (red is what you omit):\n \n \"It must be made a sacred maxim, that the militia obey the executive power, which represents the whole people in the execution of laws. To suppose arms in the hands of the citizens, to be used at individual discretion, except in private self defense, or by partial orders of towns, counties, or districts of a state, is to demolish every constitution, and lay the laws prostrate, so that liberty can be enjoyed by no man is a dissolution of the government. The fundamental law of the militia is, that it be created, directed, and commanded by the laws, and ever for the support of the laws.\"\n When one reads the complete quote, you see that Adams is simply discussing the uses of arms in supporting and enforcing law. Only the militia proper, or individuals when charged to do so by a local constable (as a member of a recognized posse) may enforce the law. A private citizen can not take the law into his own hands and mete out justice, \"except in private self-defense.\" An individual is not to use his weapon against another for selfish private purposes e.g., street-justice and vigilantism, debt collection, revenge, etc, or all law will fail and chaos will rule.\n \n Sorry Brady, at intellectual honesty, you fail.",
