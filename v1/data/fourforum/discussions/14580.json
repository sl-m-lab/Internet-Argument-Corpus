   "What Do Flat Earthers and Gun Control Advocates Have in Common?\n I'm not exactly sure when it happened, but being for gun control has gone from a legitimate political viewpoint to mental illness.\n July 21, 2010 - by Frank J. Fleming\n \n They say there are still people who believe the earth is flat. Despite all the evidence, despite the logic of the earth being a sphere, despite the pictures from space, despite the fact you can fly over the poles &#8212; there are some people who still cling to their silly, completely disproved notion of a flat earth. It&#8217;s like for some completely unfathomable reason they made the choice to be stupid and will not be moved from that position. It seemed like an urban legend to me &#8212; that there were some people out there perhaps pretending to believe in a flat earth, only as a gag &#8212; until I saw there were some people with just as stupid and illogical beliefs who I know aren&#8217;t part of a hoax: the few people left in the U.S. who still support increasing gun control.\n \n Yes, they are a dwindling few and have been for some time, but they are still out there, and it&#8217;s completely inexplicable. And we&#8217;re not just talking weirdos on some obscure board on the internet; these are actual public officeholders working on laws. And they are completely unmovable by even the most basic logic and facts.\n \n When states first started passing right-to-carry laws, the gun control people warned of a return to the Wild West where people would shoot each other at the drop of the hat and criminals would become more violent in retaliation. Now, decades later, there are shall-issue laws in at least forty states, where anyone who is not a felon can carry a handgun. Crime has gone down. None of the gun control proponents&#8217; wild-eyed fantasies have come true. The rare outbreak of random violence &#8212; the shooting spree &#8212; happens almost exclusively in &#8220;gun-free&#8221; zones. So what are the arguments of pro-gun control people now when there is a proposal to relax gun laws? They use the exact same arguments they used twenty-five years ago as if nothing has changed!\n \n Just look at the cavemen in Chicago panicking that thundersticks are now legal for honest citizens to own. They&#8217;re freaking out that now there will be unspeakable violence in their streets. Worse than they have already made things with their gun prohibition laws? Is that even possible? It&#8217;s as if they think they are the first city ever in which handguns have been made legal.\n \n Again, decades of data of people being able to carry guns don&#8217;t even inform them in the slightest. Facts bounce off their thick heads like pebbles off a tank. If there was even a modicum of truth to their insane, illogical beliefs on gun ownership, wouldn&#8217;t they have numerous examples of violent outbreaks to point to in all the states that allow people to carry concealed handguns? But none exist, because all those fantasies were cooked up by XXXXXX who don&#8217;t understand human behavior or liberty. Most have realized this by now, but there are a few holdouts still clamping their hands over their ears trying to block out reality and reason. I&#8217;m not exactly sure when it happened, but being for gun control has gone from a legitimate political viewpoint to mental illness.",

   "Let me comment on what Doc has posted about the Michigan case holding self-defense applies for felons in possession. In 2001 Virginia recognized that the Common Law of self-defense applies to felons in possession of a firearm, but it has limitations as you can see from reading the cases I cite.\n \n First, the statute:\n \n Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2\n A. It shall be unlawful for (i) any person who has been convicted of a felon&#8230;to knowingly and intentionally possess or transport any firearm or ammunition for a firearm.\n \n Next, the case that held self-defense applies\n \n Humphrey v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 36, 553 S.E.2d 546 (2001)\n (Note that the issue in this case was the defendant asked for a jury instruction of self-defense, which the trial court said he could not have because there was no self-defense exception in the statute. He was convicted, and on appeal asked for a new trial with the right to present a self-defense instruction.)\n \n A. Facts:\n \n On the evening of December 29, 1999, appellant was at his house trailer with Mark King. The trailer was located &#8220;in the woods&#8221; of New Kent County on property owned by appellant's father. A few minutes after King arrived, sometime after dark, Phillip Skipper and his brother, Franky Skipper, drove up to appellant's trailer and appeared as if they had been drinking. The four then &#8220;[sat] around . . . drinking&#8221; and &#8220;having a good time.&#8221; Appellant had consumed six beers during the course of the evening from about 6:00 p.m. forward. Within an hour or so, appellant's girlfriend arrived at the trailer, and appellant asked the others to leave. King prepared to go, but the Skippers resisted appellant's request. Appellant then complained to Phillip Skipper that he had told Phillip not to bring Franky to appellant's trailer any more because Franky had stolen appellant's Coleman lamp. When the Skipper brothers &#8220;started giving [appellant] a hard time,&#8221; appellant asked them to leave his property and told them they were trespassing. &#8220;[N]o fists or [violence]&#8221; were involved and no weapons were displayed, but the discussion involved &#8220;heated&#8221; words and &#8220;cussing.&#8221; Franky Skipper &#8220;threatened [appellant],&#8221; telling him, &#8220;I will get you, you son of a bitch, or something like that,&#8221; and &#8220;I'll . . . fix your XXX.&#8221; King then [Page 42] drove away, and the Skippers followed behind him in their white pickup truck bearing the logo, &#8220;James River Heating & Air Conditioning,&#8221; in blue lettering, with Phillip Skipper at the wheel.\n \n Fifteen to twenty minutes later, as appellant was turning off the light in the trailer's kitchen, appellant and his girlfriend heard gunshots. Appellant called the police to report a shooting in progress. He then opened the front door and saw flashes of gunfire coming from the bottom of the driveway in the direction of his home. The gunfire was coming from the passenger side of the same white pickup truck that the Skippers had been driving earlier. The shooter was leaning across the hood of the truck from the passenger side, but appellant could not see the shooter or the driver well enough to identify either of them.\n \n The truck eased closer and the shooting continued. Appellant testified that &#8220;[he] was in fear for [his] life and [his] girlfriend's life, too.&#8221; He told her to go to the bedroom, which was toward the back of the trailer, because he &#8220;[did not] want her to get hit&#8221; by gunfire. Appellant then ran twenty-five to thirty yards, directly through the line of fire, to a nearby shed owned by his father. From the shed, appellant retrieved a shotgun. Appellant's father had left the shotgun on appellant's front porch several days earlier, and appellant had moved the shotgun to the shed at his father's request. Appellant ran back to the front porch and fired two shots into the air &#8220;just to try to scare them away . . . just till the police got there.&#8221; The occupants of the truck may have fired an additional shot or two but left almost immediately. Appellant then tossed the shotgun on top of his trailer, re-entered the house, and called the police a second time.\n \n Officer Christopher Spare arrived fourteen minutes after appellant first called the police to report gunshots. When Officer Spare first arrived, appellant was not forthcoming about the shotgun he had retrieved, but he eventually told Spare he was a convicted felon and that the firearm was atop his trailer. Appellant and Spare inspected the trailer for [Page 43] evidence of gunshot damage but were unable to find any bullet holes that night. A few days later, appellant observed a bullet hole in the front side of the trailer, near the spot in the kitchen where appellant was standing when the shooting first began.\n \n Appellant was indicted and tried for possessing or transporting a firearm, on or about December 29, 1999, after having been convicted of a violent felony. At trial, appellant admitted that he was a convicted felon and that he knew he was not allowed to possess a firearm. He testified that he feared for his life and wanted to protect himself and his girlfriend and that he &#8220;had no other choice at the time,&#8221; because the Skippers had threatened him and he had already called the police. He said &#8220;[A] trailer is not the perfect place to be hiding when you're being shot at,&#8221; and he testified he thought the Skippers could &#8220;[b]ust right through [the trailer] door&#8221; if he did not take steps to stop them. Appellant's girlfriend agreed that she and appellant &#8220;[were not] very well protected inside the trailer.&#8221; When appellant was asked why he did not retreat to the back of the trailer or into the woods when the shooting began, appellant said, &#8220;I'm not going to be found . . . dead in the woods, me and my girlfriend. I had to do what I had to do.&#8221;\n \n B. Legal discussion\n \n &#8220;The law of self-defense is the law of necessity.&#8221; McGhee v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 560, 562, 248 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1978).\n \n The [common law] defense of necessity traditionally addresses the dilemma created when physical forces beyond the actor's control render &#8220;illegal conduct the lesser of two evils.&#8221; . . . The essential elements of this defense include: (1) a reasonable belief that the action was necessary to avoid an imminent threatened harm; (2) a lack of other adequate means to avoid the threatened harm; and (3) a direct causal relationship that may be reasonably anticipated between the action taken and the avoidance of the harm.\n \n Buckley v. City of Falls Church, 7 Va. App. 32, 33, 371 S.E.2d 827, 827-28 (1988) (quoting United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 410, 100 S. Ct. 624, 634, 62 L. Ed. 2d 575 (1980))&#8230;.\n \n &#8220;A person who reasonably apprehends [imminent] bodily harm by another is privileged to exercise reasonable force to repel the assault.&#8221; Diffendal v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 417, 421, 382 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1989). As set out above, the essential elements of the necessity defense, which allows a convicted felon to possess a firearm for self-defense,4 include &#8220;(1) a reasonable belief that the action was necessary to avoid an imminent threatened harm; (2) a lack of other adequate means to avoid the threatened harm; and (3) a direct causal relationship that may be reasonably anticipated between the action taken and the avoidance of the harm.&#8221; Buckley, 7 Va. App. at 33, 371 S.E.2d at 827-28.\n \n &#8220;[W]hether the danger is reasonably apparent is always to be determined from the viewpoint of the defendant at the time he acted.&#8221; McGhee, 219 Va. at 562, 248 S.E.2d at 810. &#8220;It is not essential to the right of self-defense that the danger should in fact exist.&#8221; Id. However, &#8220;the test is not [merely] whether the accused thought or believed at the time of the killing that he was in imminent danger of great bodily harm. . . . He [both] must have believed and must have had reasonable ground to believe, at the time, that he was in such [Page 50] danger.&#8221; Perkins v. Commonwealth, 186 Va. 867, 877, 44 S.E.2d 426, 430 (1947).5\n \n Implicit in the application of such a defense to the crime of possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony is that the felon may possess the weapon only so long as is necessary to protect himself from the imminent threat. See, e.g., Panter, 688 F.2d at 272. Necessity provides no defense to a charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon if the felon takes possession of the firearm before the threat becomes imminent or retains possession longer than required after the danger has passed. See, e.g., id.; see also Marrero v. State, 516 So. 2d 1052, 1055-56 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1987) (holding whether accused retained possession longer than necessary was question of fact)&#8230;.\n \n Thus, we conclude the trial court erred in holding the defense of necessity or self-defense may never be asserted to a charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. See United States v. Panter, 688 F.2d 268, 271-72 & n.4 (5th Cir. 1982) (holding necessity defense available to charge of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a)(1), federal statute which prohibits convicted felons from possessing weapons but excepts [Page 48] prisoners entrusted with firearms by a competent authority and ex-felons who have been pardoned).3\n \n &#8220;[The legislature] in enacting criminal statutes legislates against a background of Anglo-Saxon common law. . . .&#8221; Part of this common law is the doctrine of self-defense. . . . [S]tatutes rarely enumerate the defenses to the crimes they describe. . . . We do not believe that [the legislature] intended to make [convicted felons] hapless targets for assassins. The right to defend oneself from deadly attack is fundamental. [The legislature] did not contemplate that [Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2] would divest convicted felons of that right.\n \n (emphasis on the word \"imminent\" in original)\n \n \n C. Court&#8217;s application of the law to the evidence\n \n The evidence here, viewed in the light most favorable to appellant, supported a necessity instruction because it established that appellant was without fault in provoking the altercation, that he reasonably feared he was in imminent danger of being killed or seriously injured at the time he took possession of the weapon on December 29, 1999,6 that he [Page 51] lacked other adequate means to avoid the threatened harm, and that he disposed of the weapon immediately after the danger had passed&#8230; .The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to appellant, establishes that the Skipper brothers arrived at appellant's trailer already intoxicated and that appellant, Mark King, and the Skipper brothers &#8220;[sat] around . . . drinking&#8221; and &#8220;having a good time.&#8221; When appellant's girlfriend arrived at the trailer, appellant asked his guests to leave, but the Skipper brothers resisted. Although appellant mentioned his belief that Franky Skipper previously had stolen a lamp from appellant, reminded Phillip Skipper that he had told Phillip not to bring Franky to appellant's trailer again, and told the men they were trespassing, &#8220;[n]o fists or [violence]&#8221; were involved and no weapons were displayed. Appellant's statements to the Skippers did not constitute misconduct sufficient to deprive appellant of the right to claim self-defense.\n \n The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to appellant, also established that appellant reasonably feared he was in imminent danger of being killed or seriously injured when shots were fired at his trailer a short time later. Franky Skipper, before departing appellant's trailer as a passenger in a white &#8220;James River Heating & Air Conditioning&#8221; pickup [Page 53] truck driven by his brother, had threatened appellant, telling appellant, &#8220;I will get you, you son of a bitch,&#8221; and &#8220;I'll . . . fix your XXX.&#8221; No more than twenty minutes later, the same pickup truck returned and drove up appellant's driveway as the passenger leaned across the hood and fired shots at appellant's trailer. Appellant believed the shooter was Franky Skipper and testified that &#8220;[he] was in fear for [his] life and [his] girlfriend's life, too.&#8221; He called 911 and then retrieved his father's shotgun from his father's nearby shed, even though he had to run through the line of fire to do so, because he feared that if he did not arm himself before the police could respond to his rural location, the Skippers would break down the trailer door or pursue him and his girlfriend into the woods. Appellant testified that he feared for his and his girlfriend's lives and that he &#8220;had no other choice at the time.&#8221; Finally, appellant testified he threw the shotgun onto the roof of his trailer immediately after he had succeeded in chasing his assailants away.\n \n The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to appellant, supported a necessity instruction because it established that appellant's possession of the shotgun on December 29, 1999 was for the purpose of justifiable self-defense and lasted only as long as necessary for appellant to defend himself and his girlfriend.\n \n \n Two cases since that show the limitations of the self-defense claim:\n \n 1. Byers v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 174, 554 S.E.2d 714 (2001)\n \n a. Facts\n \n On March 14, 1999, Byers attempted to stop an acquaintance, Deetzie Crow, from stealing a car. Crow retaliated by shooting Byers in his right shoulder. The wounding required Byers to be hospitalized and his right arm immobilized through the use of a sling.\n \n Crow apparently fled the Commonwealth after the shooting, but Byers testified he received word that Crow &#8220;would finish the job,&#8221; so he could not testify against Crow. Byers did not know Crow's whereabouts or whether Crow knew where to find him, but he feared for his life. Byers, a convicted felon, inquired of his probation officer and a police officer investigating the shooting how to proceed to obtain permission to possess a firearm. The officers were unable to assist Byers in his request and confirmed to him that he could not have a firearm. The record does not indicate Byers filed a petition under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(C) to have his right to possess a firearm restored. [Page 179]\n \n On April 5, 1999, a loaded Mossberg twelve-gauge shotgun was found by law enforcement officers in Byers' home. Teresa Climmer purchased the firearm, at Byers' direction, on March 26, 1999. At that time, she was Byers' live-in girlfriend. The firearm was kept in the couple's bedroom. When the firearm was found by authorities, however, Teresa Climmer no longer resided with Byers who then had complete access to the firearm at all times.\n \n b. Court&#8217;s analysis and ruling\n \n In Humphrey, 36 Va. App. 36, 553 S.E.2d 546, we recently held that the General Assembly did not abrogate the common law [Page 184] defense of necessity in the enactment of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Id. at 48, 553 S.E.2d at 551. We also reiterated the essential elements of a necessity defense:\n \n &#8220;(1) [A] reasonable belief that the action was necessary to avoid an imminent threatened harm; (2) a lack of other adequate means to avoid the threatened harm; and (3) a direct causal relationship that may be reasonably anticipated between the action taken and the avoidance of the harm.&#8221;\n \n Id. at 45, 553 S.E.2d at 550 (quoting Buckley v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 32, 33, 371 S.E.2d 827, 827-28 (1988)). Applying these factors to the facts in Humphrey, we found there were sufficient facts in that record to require a jury instruction on the defense of necessity to a charged violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.\n \n The facts in Humphrey, however, are in stark contrast to those in the case at bar. In Humphrey, the convicted felon was under direct attack by gunfire in his isolated home at the time he took possession of a firearm. Those circumstances reflected an &#8220;imminent threatened harm,&#8221; and the convicted felon had no other means to avoid the harm.\n \n In United States v. Crittendon, 883 F.2d 326 (4th Cir. 1989), the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit decided a case similar to that at bar in the context of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), the federal equivalent to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.1\n \n Crittendon, a convicted felon had been shot and thereafter received death threats over the telephone. He [Page 185] subsequently armed himself with a pistol for self-protection from the perceived threat and was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). The trial court accepted Crittendon's claim that he possessed the gun for self-defense and not a nefarious purpose. Nonetheless, there was no evidence showing he was in any imminent danger when he was arrested for possession of the firearm. His conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) was affirmed on the following basis:\n \n [Crittendon's] claim of entitlement to an instruction on the defense fails because the evidence does not support a conclusion that he was under a present or imminent threat of death or injury. While his fear of another attack may have been rational and might have been his real motivation for carrying a revolver, generalized fears will not support the defense of justification. See United States v. Harper, 802 F.2d 115 (5th Cir. 1986) (convicted felon who purchased hand gun for protection after repeated robberies of his store not entitled to justification instruction because he was not in imminent danger). Instead, the defendant must show that a real and specific threat existed at the time of the unlawful possession.\n \n Id. at 330.2\n \n The criteria applied in Humphrey and Crittendon did not entitle Byers to a jury instruction on the common law defense of necessity to arm. While Byers contends he was in fear of bodily harm from Crow, who had shot Byers several months earlier, Byers only had a generalized fear. At the time of Byers' arrest for possession of the firearm, Crow had not been apprehended. While Byers testified that threats to &#8220;finish the job&#8221; of killing him had been allegedly made by [Page 186] Crow, the threats were not made directly to him. Byers was not aware of Crow's location and did not know if Crow knew of his.\n \n There was no evidence at the time Byers possessed the shotgun that he faced an imminent threat of death or injury as was the case in Humphrey. Any threat from Crow was speculative. Under these circumstances, the defense of necessity cannot apply and, therefore, no jury instruction was warranted. Accordingly, the proffered instruction was not supported by the evidence and was properly refused. &#8220;An instruction that is not supported by the evidence . . . is properly refused.&#8221; Lea v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 300, 304, 429 S.E.2d 477, 479-80 (1993).\n \n The ruling of the trial court rejecting the proffered jury instruction was correct, and Byers' conviction is affirmed.\n \n \n 2. Waller v. Commonwealth, 52 Va. App. 571, 665 S.E.2d 848 (2008)\n \n a. Facts\n \n The evidence before the trial court showed that a deputy sheriff was dispatched to Waller's home in response to an alleged threat. The deputy found Waller placing a long-barreled weapon underneath a van in the front yard. After the deputy restrained Waller, the deputy found a loaded handgun in Waller's back pocket and a shotgun, a rifle, and a pistol under the van. The cylinder and shells for the pistol under the van were found in Waller's pocket.\n \n Waller took the stand at trial and testified he was 69 years old at the time of the offense. He lived alone and owned the property. His 25-year-old nephew lived nearby. The nephew came by that day, and the two argued in the front yard. Waller accused his nephew of stealing from him. The nephew said: &#8220;I'm going to get my gun and I'll be back.&#8221; Waller claimed his nephew intended to kill him. After making these threats, the nephew got in his car and drove off. Waller then &#8220;went in the woods&#8221; to retrieve various firearms stored on his property. Waller knew where to find them, he admitted, &#8220;Cause I know somebody put them there for me.&#8221;\n \n Waller had previously placed the weapons under &#8220;old table tops&#8221; to keep them &#8220;from getting rained on and messed up.&#8221; He said &#8220;somebody&#8221; (whom he never named) &#8220;was letting [him] use them.&#8221; He needed them, Waller argued, to &#8220;[p]rotect my life&#8221; but admitted that he also used the shotgun for hunting.\n \n After arming himself, he went to the front yard to wait for his nephew's return. Waller did not retreat, call the police, or call anyone else. Waller's nephew never returned. Instead, the next person Waller saw was the deputy sheriff. Waller said about 35 to 45 minutes passed between arming himself and the arrival of the deputy. \n \n b. Court&#8217;s analysis and ruling\n \n The common law defense of necessity applies to violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. The &#8220;essential elements&#8221; of this defense require a &#8220;reasonable belief that the action was necessary to avoid an imminent threatened harm&#8221; and a &#8220;lack of other adequate means to avoid the threatened harm.&#8221; Byers v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 174, 183-84, 554 S.E.2d 714, 718 (2001) (quoting Humphrey v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 36, 45, 553 S.E.2d 546, 550 (2001)). In addition, the evidence must prove &#8220;a direct causal relationship that may be reasonably anticipated between the action taken and the avoidance of the harm.&#8221; Id. [Page 578]\n \n The trial court, sitting as factfinder, found that the evidence did not establish the elements of the necessity defense. This conclusion could have been reached from any number of perspectives. The court could have concluded Waller exaggerated the story. The nephew never testified. Nor did anyone else. Only Waller testified that his nephew threatened to kill him. The trial court had no obligation to accept this wholly uncorroborated allegation, offered by Waller in support of his only defense to the charge. See Coleman v. Commonwealth, 52 Va. App. 19, 25, 660 S.E.2d 687, 690-91 (2008); Dugger v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 586, 594 n.2, 580 S.E.2d 477, 481 n.2 (2003). To be sure, the &#8220;power to segregate a witness's testimony into the believable, partly believable, or wholly unbelievable is an exercise of decisional discretion intrinsic to the factfinding task and essential to its proper performance.&#8221; Harper v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 517, 523, 642 S.E.2d 779, 782 (2007).\n \n On the other hand, the trial court could have accepted Waller's explanation (either as fact or merely for arguendo purposes) but found the alleged threat insufficiently imminent to warrant Waller's decision to outfit himself with multiple firearms and to lay in wait 35 to 45 minutes for the anticipated shootout with his nephew. Waller did not call the police. He did not walk away from the home to avoid his nephew's contemplated return. To the contrary, Waller seemed anxious to prepare himself for a mortal gunfight with his nephew. &#8220;Implicit in the application of such a defense&#8221; is that the felon &#8220;may possess the weapon only so long as is necessary to protect himself from the imminent threat.&#8221; Humphrey, 37 Va. App. at 50, 553 S.E.2d at 553 (emphasis in original). The trial court had ample basis to conclude that, even accepting Waller's testimony at face value, he never truly faced &#8220;imminent threatened harm,&#8221; nor did he lack &#8220;other adequate means to avoid the threatened harm.&#8221; Byers, 37 Va. App. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 718.3 [Page 579]\n \n In such cases, we cannot discern with certainty &#8220;which scenario best describes&#8221; what the factfinder was thinking. Seaton v. Commonwealth, 42 Va. App. 739, 752, 595 S.E.2d 9, 15 (2004). &#8220;But that does not matter for purposes of resolving this appeal.&#8221; Id. In either one, the factfinder &#8220;would have been acting well within [its] factfinding discretion.&#8221; Id. For these reasons, we hold the evidence was sufficient for the trial court to reject Waller's necessity defense.",

   "On the question of gun laws, maybe we are asking the wrong question. Since this is a Constitutionally Protected Right of We the People, and since it is a Fundamental Right, shouldn't the proper question be, do they work? emoticon_smile\n \n More recent gun laws were all sold to us as common sense, crime prevention tools. I believe that every law that can't prove it's worth, to prevent crime, should be repealed! \n \n Lets have a trial on the crime preventing value of each and every recent high profile gun law that we now have on the books. Let's expunge all of of the gun laws that don't do what they were advertised to do! \n \n Isn't that the fair and proper thing to do for our Constitution, that many had to die for in order to preserve? \n \n What do you say Antis? Get on Board! Do it for the Constitution, truth, justice, and the American way! emoticon_smile",

   "  Maybe the NRA's right to be paranoid \n My daughter gave her daddy a gun for his birthday. As a law-abiding citizen he went to transfer ownership. Ten days later a letter arrived from the Department of Justice - transfer denied, stated my husband is a felon and he can't have fire arms. Shock: He knew he was not a felon, had bought and registered guns for years, and now that department states that he is a felon since 1972 and can't have any guns.\n \n My husband called the Department of Justice. No, they could not tell him what his crime was or anything about it. (Huge run around. Paying for a criminal background check that proved he was no criminal) Three week later, still no answers.\n \n He started calling the Department of Justice over and over. No, they did not have the Live Scan request. No, they did not know what the problem was. No, they still could not give him information about the alleged crime. Over and over, still no answers, and sorry we now have lost your file. I will have to give my husband credit: He did not yell, swear or threaten these jerks that we are paying to so-called protect us from registered gun owners.\n \n One month later panic is about to set in, as hunting season is getting close. Another interesting piece of information: He bought his hunting license and deer tag before he tried to transfer that gift from our daughter. No problem, it was issued without the slightest objection.\n \n One more final phone call to the Department of Justice stating we were going to hire an attorney. So, interesting, they now said, \"Oh sorry. Someone made a mistake. You are not a felon. No we have not sent you a copy of your record (that we paid for). No, we won't send you a letter saying you're not a felon but we have flagged your file and you should not have any further problems.\"\n \n What is going on when a government agency can write a letter stating, \"You are a felon, you may not have guns, no we won't tell you what you did, but you're guilty until you prove different?\" Then, when we did not back off, \"Gee, sorry. Guess you are not a felon, but we won't put it in writing.\"\n I believe our government is supposed to be \"we the people.\" \"We the people\" are supposed to be running things, not the government. So pay attention, vote and force the government to be the servant of \"we the people.\"\n\n \n \n   Cuts in police services from budget crunch means citizens are 'on their own' \n When USA Today reported Aug. 25 that budget cuts are forcing local police agencies across the country to stop responding to certain crimes, the revelation reinforced a growing public sentiment that we the people are responsible for our own well-being, not government.\n \n Right now, according the USA Today story, police are only declining to respond to property crimes. But what is next, if the economy continues its downturn under what many view as a disastrous fiscal agenda of the current Congress and administration? For those who have balked at the \"trickle down\" theory, here's a short refresher course: If the federal government sneezes, states catch a cold.\n",
