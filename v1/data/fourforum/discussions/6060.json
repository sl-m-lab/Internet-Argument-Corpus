   "What is the big deal? Did an administration bigwig and leading neocon philosopher, Karl Rove, give up the name of a covert CIA agent? Is it possible that this is another liberal attempt to bring down the Bush II administration by any means, much like they tried with Bush Sr. and Reagan? My take on this mess is that the Administration, with Karl Rove at the head, tried to discredit the agent's husband for having the audacity to question the President's information regarding Saddam Hussein's intentions. Neoconservatives have neither the time nor patience for people who do not follow their lead, and are willing to take them down by any means necessary. Do Rove's actions constitute a felony? No. It seems that he was simply stating information that was already well-known. Liberals will take any opportunity to throw a monkey-wrench in the works. Neocons have providing them with a great opportunity to mire our government in yet another scandal.\n \n If you have time, please visit Cobbtown Political Forum",

   "A male prostitute, Jeff Gannon, a reputed journalist, attended George W. Bush press conferences, apparently without having been cleared by the Secret Service and the FBI. Gannon asked Bush \"soft ball\" questions. There is reason to believe that \"Gannon\" is actually Johnny Gosch who disappeared or was kidnapped at age 12 and made part of a ring of teen age prostitutes arranged by pedophile Daddy Bush. Omaha. Chicago, District of Columbia. \n In recent years, on one-day passes, Gannon visited George W. Bush's White House apartment some 200 times, according to U.S. Secret Service records which do not note if Gannon left each time after one day. Available to one or more federal grand juries have been witnesses who support the contentions that Bush himself gave directly to Gannon data as to the deep cover secret role of Valerie Plame; and that Gannon reportedly proceeded to distribute such data to various mass media people and others.",
