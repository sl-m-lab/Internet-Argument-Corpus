   "as derived from my exploratory campaign website.... mosheh(dot)org\n \n \n ------------------\n \n Freedom vs Civil Liberties : In 1933, they literally took away constitutional freedom and rights and protections, and gave the people something else, called Civil Liberties, which is granted at the pleasure of the Federal Government, and slowly over the past 80 years, they have created more and more laws, statute laws which the people are forced to obey, 66 million laws and counting, ALL OF WHICH IS UN-CONSTITUTIONAL.\n \n THEY took away the protection of the common law legal system, as provided for in the Constitution, and forced all the people into 14th amendment corporate status, without our informed knowledge, so that they may enforce endless laws on us, most especially taxation, under penalty of prison, which is something they simply could not do in a constitutional common law court. We got ripped off, and enslaved.\n \n \n \n \n Proposals for Freedom vs Civil Liberties : \n \n When the Constitution is restored as law, the common law legal system also gets restored, and as such, the people regain freedom by ending the mandatory 14th amendment Federal citizenship forced on the people in 1933. As under the common law, people are sovereign free people (State citizens), who are free to do as they please, go where they please, posess what they please, so long as they do no harm, do not endanger others, and do not damage any property or otherwise infringe on the freedom of other free people.\n \n THAT WAS FREEDOM, and under the common law, the only REAL CRIMES, are rape, murder, thieft, assault, liable, and the doing of harm in some way to people or property, or the infringement of the rights and freedoms of others, and the punishment for violations of the common law, was hard labor, or in the case of rapists, execution, or life in prison.\n \n Under the common law, THERE IS NO REVOLVING DOOR PRISON SYSTEM... that door is closed, and with real punishment as a real deterrent, criminals know better than to continue to commit crimes, because they will not be getting to watch TV, or have decent foods, or the ability to sit around and socialize. No.. they all get hard labor, and must literally work to repay their debt to society, with labor. (The ACLU was created in 1933, to protect criminals.)\n \n And perhaps as important as anything is the idea that when the court provides an attorney to defend a suspect, that Attorney must be paid an amount comprable to the Prosecuter, and those attorneys must focus on the defence of their clients, and be limited in how many cases they can take on at any given time, and must be mandated to serve their clients, instead of rushing them through as quickly as possible, so as to make the most money by doing so, as this has resulted in bad defence efforts for the people over the past 40 years and it must stop, and attorneys who do not defend their clients, but instead work with prosecuters to force a deal and plea, should themselves be prosecuted for neglecting the purpose of their position, as defence attorneys. \n THE ENTIRE STATUTE LEGAL SYSTEM.. was an experiment started in 1933, and forced on the people, and it is inherently un-constitutional, it robs the people of constitutional freedom, and is the greatest evidence we have for the oppressiveness of our government at this time. It must end, and common law freedom restored. \n \n \n Good people should be free, and bad people should actually be punished. \n \n ( the common law says..... NO HARM = NO FOUL )\n ( HARM = violence, thieft, rape, murder, etc....)\n \n \n \n In 1933, FDR forced all Americans into Federal citizenship, which gives the Federal Government the power to impose any laws as statutes that they see fit, over the people, and they did so, so as to enforce taxation, and over the past 80 years, have robbed us all of every shred of freedom the American people once had, by raising the children of America to think that the existing statute court system, is constitutional, WHEN IN FACT, IT IS NOT. \n IT IS A SHAM.. a crime against freedom, and they have used it to fill the prisons with literally millions of people, who under the Constitution should never of been arrested in the first place, all of which, HAS NOT MADE US SAFER, since they reduced the punishment for REAL CRIMINALS, in exchange for the power to make endless laws.\n It was a rip off! A Bad Deal, which only benefits criminals! \n \n It was an experiment in law, started in 1933... a sham... and it doesnt work.\n \n THE ACLU AND CIVIL LIBERTIES WERE CREATED IN 1933!! \n TO REPLACE OUR REAL CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOM!! \n (Which they took away!!!)\n \n \n \n THAT IS A FACT! \n \n We want our freedom back!\n \n ( Constitutional freedom, NOT ACLU civil liberties ) \n \n And we want the ACLU dissolved, and the common law justice of the Constitution restored, which will CLOSE the REVOLVING DOOR PRISONS for good, by providing real punishment for real crimes, as a real deterrent.\n \n \n \n \n The Constitution must be restored as law, and with it, FREEDOM.\n \n \n -Mosheh Thezion",

   "the problem here.. is you dont realise what the common law is... or was.\n \n Civil liberties... was established in 1933.. as part of the new deal..\n \n prohibition.. is a perfect example.. they had to have a constitutional amendment to make it illegal for the free people to consume alcohol.. because under the Common law... people are free to do what they wish, posess what they wish, in all ways... as long as they do no harm and do not infringe on other people...\n \n in 1933... they gave us Civil liberties, by forcing us all into 14th amendment citizenship..\n \n thats key... because it was not required before 1933..\n \n thats key... because in the 14th amendment.. its states..we are under the juridiction of the Federal Government.\n \n it says.. United States... which legally, means Federal Government, to distinguishe it from.. states...\n and it.. provides priviledges and immunities.. which free people do not need, if they are subject to the common law.\n \n \n \n \n Amendment 14 - Citizenship Rights. Ratified 7/9/1868.\n \n 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \n \n \n \n This was a protection given to ex-slaves, who at the time had no protections under the Common law.. and this was written to protect them.\n \n As 14th amdnement citizens.. the Federal government gained the power to write and impose statutes to define... and limit the actual effective limits of their Rights... and by law.. could protect them,by demanding that courts prosecute them, in accordance with Federal statute laws.\n \n \n \n let me put it this way...\n \n If you are dragged into a Common law court, the court prosecuter would have to show the court that you actually did something wrong... a true crime... and provide evidence of it...\n \n In a statute court, the prosecuter need only show that you broke a rule.. violated a statute.. and the jury is told to deside if you broke that rule, and NOT whether OR NOT it was a real crime OR NOT.\n \n in a common law court, if you had cocaine and a gun in your pockets... they would have to show that .. 1) there is a constitutional amendment prohibiting cocaine... or guns... 2) show that you did something bad, with that cocaine or gun... HURT SOMEONE.. DAMAGED STUFF.. ETC...\n \n posession in itself.. is not a common law crime, because you havent actually done anything wrong..\n \n \n \n In a statute court... they would only need to show that there is a statute which makes cocaine a STATUTE CRIME.. and posessing a gun.. a STATUTE CRIME.. and as such... all they need to do is show the jury that you had these things.. which the jury would agree with... which proves you broke a statute.. but.. even though you broke a statute rule, you still never did anything wrong.. (BUT THAT DOESNT MATTER IN A STATUTE COURT... because with civil liberties.. we must obey all statutes!!!)\n \n thats the difference..\n \n and so..\n consider... \n \n \n \n Amendment 7 - Trial by Jury in Civil Cases. Ratified 12/15/1791.\n \n In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\n \n \n Amendment 5 - Trial and Punishment, Compensation for Takings. Ratified 12/15/1791.\n \n \n No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\n \n \n \n an infamous crime.. is a felony.. which is punishable by more than one year..\n \n there are a lot of statute crimes... punishable for more than one year..\n \n but today... PEOPLE ARE ARRESTED EVERYDAY... and convicted... but are they indicted by a grand jury???????????????\n \n no....\n \n \n \n with civil liberties.. the prosecuter can just do it.. without a grand jury.\n \n \n is that Constitutional??? no...\n \n Civil liberties.. allows the government to avoid the protections of the Common law.. and the rules clearly stated in the constitution.\n \n \n \n \n I agree... the ACLU.. is not evil.. they have done alot of good. (I changed my stance, and dont feel the need to disban it now.)\n \n \n Since the Government took away COMMON LAW freedom... it has been the ACLU which offers the people a lot of protection...\n \n but.. only because we are no longer free, under common law standards...\n \n is that ok?\n \n no...\n \n civil liberties.. gives the government to power to deside the limits of all our rights... and even eliminate them...\n \n civil liberties... is not provided for in the constitution.\n \n The common law is... and the two.. are not compatable.\n \n \n \n so... from... Senate Report - War and Emergency Powers Acts\n \n \n In 1917, the Trading with the Enemy Act (Public Law 65-91, 65th Congress, Session I, Chapters 105, 106, October 6, 1917) was passed and which defined, regulated and punished trading with enemies, who were then required by that act to be licensed by the government to do business. \n \n The National Banking System Act (Public Law 73-1, 73rd Congress, Session I, Chapter 1, March 9, 1933), Executive Proclamation 2038 (March 6, 1933), Executive Proclamation 2039 (March 9, 1933), and Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111 and 6260 prove that in 1933, the United States Government formed under the executive privilege of the original martial rule went bankrupt, and a new state of national emergency was declared under which United States citizens were named as the enemy to the government and the banking system as per the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act. \n \n soo... then.................\n \n The legal system provided for in the Constitution was formally changed in 1938 through the Supreme Court decision in the case of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 US 64, 82 L.Ed. 1188. \n On April 25, 1938, the Supreme Court overturned the standing precedents of the prior 150 years concerning \"COMMON LAW\" in the federal government. \n \n THERE IS NO FEDERAL COMMON LAW, AND CONGRESS HAS NO POWER TO DECLARE SUBSTANTIVE RULES OF COMMON LAW applicable IN A STATE, WHETHER they be LOCAL or GENERAL in their nature, be they COMMERCIAL LAW or a part of LAW OF TORTS.\" (See: ERIE RAILROAD CO. vs. THOMPKINS, 304 U.S. 64, 82 L. Ed. 1188) \n \n The significance is that since the Erie Decision, no cases are allowed to be cited that are prior to 1938. There can be no mixing of the old law with the new law. The Common Law is the fountain source of Substantive and Remedial Rights, if not our very Liberties. (See also: Who is Running America?) \n \n \n \n which is when... they ended the Common law... because earlier in 1933.. as part of the NEW DEAL.. they had already got america to agree to CIVIL LIBERTIES, by forcing everyone into 14th amendment federal citizenship.\n \n THEY DO THESE THINGS SLOWLY... so people dont get upset.\n \n \n you...should all be upset.\n \n -Mosheh Thezion",
