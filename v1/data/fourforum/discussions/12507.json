How is this a comparable parallel which applies to abortion at all? Here's a more apt question which would align with the question of choice.\n \n If someone went and sought out a man specifically to hit him in the groin with all the force he could muster with a sledgehammer, would the person about to get hit then have the right to kill the hitter when all he was doing was honoring his request? The answer to that question is absolutely not since the guy with the gun set the whole scenario up himself by his own free will and actions. \n \n Secondarily, if you are equating the unborn baby to the guy with the sledgehammer, you reveal how shallow your understanding of basic biology is. Child bearing is as natural a function as breathing in this world and is why life exists at all. To compare it to being hit in the groin with a sledgehammer which in 99% of the cases would be fatal, where as in 99% of childbirth cases the mother suffers no adverse affects, is a ludicrous and irresponsible analogy. So find a new strawman shooter because yours fails miserably.",

   "Assuming a fetus was a person, would you support the right of choice? \n \n Before you answer, here's something to think about. If a man was threatening to hit you in the groin with all the force he could muster with a sledgehammer, and you had a gun stashed in your pants, do you have the right to kill him?\n\n This is an interesting approach but it has to carry various conditions. I simply find it inconceivable to call a mindless body a person. As such, then zygotes, embryos and early fetuses cannot be called people, in my view, since they cannot have a mind, according to the neurological understanding of the source of our cognitive capabilities resting in our cerebral cortex. Late term fetuses might have a mind, according to neurologists, so, by my view of person, I would say that late term fetuses are people. \n \n However, what if we were not in this reality but in some hypothetical scenario where even zygotes had minds. Then, I would probably apply the same rules from the beginning of pregnancy as I personally currently would in the late term. Namely, I would restrict abortion to risk to mother's life, significant risk to her health (both of which are relevant to your self-defense example), mercy killing for severely deformed fetuses, rape, incest and would be open to other conditions that are brought up in debate. In such a hypothetical but unreal case, then I would make very sure that women have very easy access to long term contraceptives, sexual education early on in how to use them, and free distribution of contraceptives to poor women - all to make the risk of unwanted pregnancy as absolutely minimal as possible. Of course, this would be a good strategy to use in reality as well, but the religious right often introduces obstacles - such as opposition to teaching about the use of contraceptives in sexual education class, opposition to giving out free contraceptives, etc. There are only so many battles I am willing to fight. Since abortion is an option, that battle isn't nearly as important now as it would be in that hypothetical scenario or a potentially real scenario of abortions being outlawed.\n \n Luckily, for women's reproductive rights, the choice in reality isn't that stark. Early abortions do not kill a human being with a mind that can suffer or experience the abortion in any way, or indeed that can experience anything. Early abortions just kill a living human body with ''nobody home\" whose worth lies only in its potential to become more - a far less weighty consequence than killing a human being that can already experience the abortion or which already mentally exists.",

In Africa, the continent with the most critical level of maternal mortality, women have a 1 in 26 lifetime chance of dying during childbirth.

Right across sub-Saharan Africa and much of southern Asia mothers are dying needlessly at a time that should be joyous - just when they are bringing new life into the world.\n \n I am told that in many parts of the world it is traditional for an expectant mother to say goodbye to her husband and other children when she goes into labour, understanding that she might not see them again.\n\n Gordon Brown's wife Sarah writes in the Mirror - mirror.co.uk",

   "There are only three ways to overturn a SCOTUS decision.\n 1. Persuade the court to overrrule itself, Brown overrruled Plessey; Barnette overruled Gobitis. Not going to happen with this President in office to name replacement.\n\n Though I also have confidence and optimism that abortion rights will stay safe under this administration, it is far from certain that the balance of justices of the Supreme Court will significantly grow toward the pro-choice side since most of the Anti-choice justices are relatively young (far from retirement) and it is not guaranteed that the older pro-choice justices will retire during the Obama administration. Also, though Democratics will probably be favored as presidents as long as the economy or otherwise domestic issues dominate, this may not be the case once the economy improves - at which point the same old ridiculous political games will be played. \n \n Therefore, I find it critically important not to sit back complacently and take abortion rights for granted. Since they may someday be at risk, I find it important to remain in forums such as this to try to influence as best one can those that are undecided about abortion rights by honest, civil discussion. In this way, we can do our part in improving public opinion further toward the pro-choice side since our pro-choice majority is not large enough to be politics-proof. I am glad that you are pro-choice but I wish that you would make more effort at understanding that, in order to win over the undecided, you cannot just state your views.

One of the ways to demonstrate that concern is by acknowledging the fact that they (in addition to being clinically called \"fetuses\") are also acknowledged by the medical community as \"prebirth children.\"\n\n This term \"pre-birth children\" is far from being a universal term used by all medical practitioners. Just as with the general population, medical practitioners also range from pro-choice to pro-life where, I would guess, that it is largely pro-life medical practitioners that would be the ones addressing zygotes and embryos as pre-birth children. \n \n As I have expressed before, I do have concerns about late term fetuses since they might have a mind, might be able to suffer, etc. Indeed, I don't see a fetus one day from birth as being much different than a newborn baby except in how it affects the woman (ex. its presence in the mother can cause a risk to her life or a major risk to her health, etc.) which has its own legal implications. Otherwise, I would have similar sympathy to very late term fetuses that are aborted without good cause as I might toward born babies. The beginning of that late term is less certain but, since the development of the cerebral cortex suggests that there MIGHT be a mental existence, I personally would give the fetus the benefit of the doubt and assume that there is (just as, at end of life, I would assume that a person still has mental existence until proven otherwise). \n \n The case for zygotes, embryos and early term fetuses is much different since, lacking a mental existence, then all the reasons for my supporting rights of late term fetuses disappear. The only thing that zygotes, embryos and early term fetuses have going for them is their potential to become more - i.e. to become one of us. I do think that too many people on the pro-choice side ignore the value of this potential in disregarding it completely, thus alienating some of the undecided. I do value that potential and understand how others can value it but I always note that I value the rights of a woman over her own body more. After all, we are a country that espouses freedom. What freedom is more fundamental than the rights over ones own body? As with all freedoms, though, it has its limits and, as happens most of the time, the limits appear when there is a conflict between the rights of two individuals. I know that you personally call mind-less bodies \"individuals\" / \"people\" / \"human beings\" but, as you know, I don't since it never made sense. Just because a living entity WILL BE a person like one of us does not mean that it is one yet. What IS is not the same as what WILL BE. A zygote WILL BE a person but it makes absolutely no sense to me to call it a person while it is still a zygote and to attach the rights of a person to it when it, as a mere living thing with no mind or soul, cannot experience the lack of rights.\n \n On a last note, you claimed to agree that it is the silent readers that are the ones that are most critical to address yet, in all of your posts, I have never seen you address any concern for the women involved. In doing so, you yourself are alienating many of the same undecided readers that you are agreeing are critical. Do you have ANY sympathy for women who find themselves with unwanted pregnancies? Besides myself, I am sure that there are many silent undecided readers that would want to know.",

My concern is about the undecided reader, where they are generally undecided because they don't hold extreme opinions on either end but are trying to balance out the two positions. Two thirds of Americans generally support first trimester abortions, about two thirds generally oppose second trimester abortions and over 80% generally oppose third trimester abortions - which means that there are a LOT of people out there who hold views that are not on either extreme (this from a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll from 2003 that I found on pollingreport.com/abortion).\n \nAnd as far as the un-decided (so far silent) readers?

   "You are being dishonest as well. You committed a huge fallacy here. \n\n What, specifically, do you claim my fallacy is - that I presumed that they put \"human fetus\" as one definition since pro-life people use it that way? You may note that I used the word \"presumably\" which means that I was making a reasonable guess as to the reason that the dictionary defined child in that fashion. I did not claim it based on absolute logic. \n \nAnother fallacy. It doesn't support that at all. It only supports the idea that child is used more often in one sense than the other. It DOES NOT indicate that many people don't feel that is a proper use of the word or don't use it in \"that manner\". \n\n According to the dictionary, the term \"child\" is most often used for human beings after birth since, in dictionaries, the first definitions listed generally show the most common useage of a word, with definitions farther down the list showing less common useage. If the same word is used two different ways in the same context, that would mean that the first definition is the more common use of that word in the given context. Unless you claim that the first definition and the fourth refer to different contexts, then I don't see where you are claiming my falacy lies.\n \n Also, you should note that I never said that calling a fetus a child was an improper use according to the dictionary. I simply said that it was the less common use. Since Chuz Life seemed to imply that calling a fetus a child was THE official use, not the lesser of two, that is why I called him on it.",

   "Yeah,.. and it only takes one for the word to apply. (I bet you hate that)\n\n Your post implied that calling a fetus a \"child\" was THE only way to use the term \"child\". You were wrong. Most people use the word \"child\" only once the baby is born - as is indicated by the first definition which, by the standards of dictionaries, denotes the most common useage. I don't mind you claiming that you have the right to call a fetus a child. I DO mind you claiming that the dictionary says that child always refers to fetuses as well - it doesn't.\n \n \nRather than do that, I (and many others) choose to define a child (prebirth or otherwise) by the attributes they have.\n\n Great! Perhaps we might get somewhere now. Since you said that, I am very curious - what attributes does a zygote have that makes it a person, in your view?

The only time when I discuss semantics is in arguing against someone, you in this case, who tries to use semantics to prove their point. Instead, my main point is that there needs to be a rational basis behind rights, not just proclamations / semantics or other styles of arguement that have little to do with reason. To me, it never made sense for objects to have rights even if those objects (an unfertilized egg, a newly fertilized one, or an embryo) will someday become a person like you and me.

I think this is the argument advanced and not that something growing is therefore a person.\n\n Why do you bring up the issue of usefulness? That was never a criteria that I brought up. Is usefulness important to you in how much you value a being in terms of rights? My guess would be not. What have I said that makes you think that usefulness is important to me? Or am I misjudging your view that you thought that usefulness was important to me?\n \n It is not any sense of usefulness that drives me. What drives my moral stances, as I have noted to you in past threads, is the reciprocity of the rule of treating others as I would have myself be treated, coupled with a sense of empathy - neither of which applies to bodies with \"nobody home\". Usefulness has nothing to do with it. The only place where usefulness comes in with human beings is that I would think that more useful people should be payed more and have more responsibility, depending on their other skills. Their rights should be the same.\n \n As for your other arguments, just because something is growing into something that we value doesn't mean that it is that valued thing YET. Up to that point, it only has value from what it has the potential of becoming, not for it actually is. The litmus test for this is the hypothetical case where the thing stops growing. If a zygote doesn't develop farther, then what is its value? Why would one attach rights to it if it can never experience the lack of rights? This is very different than the question of a newborn baby or, in my view, a very late term fetus stopping growth. If such a newborn baby stops growth it can still be valued for being a person where, in my view, a person is defined by their human mind. All of my moral stances would apply. If I were to find myself as helpless and dependent as that baby, then I would also want and expect to be kept alive so I think the baby has that right. Also, I certainly would empathize with that baby since it can experience any lack of care. \n \n The same cannot be said of an early stage fetus or embryo since I cannot realistically empathize with something that has no mental existence unless I\n live in a fairyland of imagining personalities in it. Also, if I had been aborted at an early stage, then I never would have been able to tell the difference since \"I\" didn't exist yet, just the body that would become me.

   "You seem to be under the illusion that I think that what is currently legal is automatically good. Just because the law currently gives rights only from birth doesn't mean that that is where I personally think that rights SHOULD start.\n\n \nThis is so wrong on so many levels, I have to wonder if it's even worth the time and bandwidth to address the errors.\n \n a: Our rights are not given to us by the laws, AO. Our rights exist even in the absense of law. (see 9th Amendment)\n \n b: What you care or think about the current laws (good or bad) is not relevant to the issue of when a new person's life and rights actually begin.\n \n c: As to your philosophical feelings about where rights \"should\" start? You have already made it abundantly clear that you require the new child to achieve \"mental existence\" before you will repect the fact that they are a \"person.\" Which brings me right back to \"Baby K\" who was born and lived and legally protected,... even though she had no more brain than a brain stem. NO \"mental existence.\"\n \n You can squirm and dodge all you want. But your arbitrarily chosen requirement for \"personhood\" has just been dealt a lethal blow.\n\n Only people who lack any significant degree of logical reasoning would think that my requirement for personhood has been dealt a lethal blow.\n \n Taking on your points one by one:\n a. The 9th Amendment may state that our rights are not limited to those enumerated in the Constitution but that means little when there is no agreement as to what rights, outside of the Constitution, people have. If you claim that there is universal agreement about certain rights outside of the Constitution, then name them. \n b. In this forum, we are not only arguing about what the law states. We are also arguing what we think the law should be. Of course, neither my opinion nor yours changes what the law currently states. We are both simply exercising our 1st Amendment rights of free speech to explain out own personal views in order to influence the views of others. I have as much free speech rights as you do, no more no less.\n c. I already said that I personally would not give \"baby K\" rights because she did not have a mental existence, so my stance is logically consistent. This means that, yes, I disagree with the law. Just as I disagree with the law in thinking that late term fetuses should have rights.\n \n Once again, your logic has been shown to be flawed. This will be further revealed by my relatively certain prediction that you will ignore these points and change the subject.\n \n<skipped worthless flaming<I feel that the time will eventually come that Justices Roberts, Scalia, Thomas and Alito will pick up on the findings such as the fact that a person's aging begins at conception and overturn the courts ruling on Roe.\n \n In fact, this bill may provide just the sort of push it will take.\n \n ND House Passes Abortion Ban\n \n Feb 17 2009 7:37PM\n KXMCTV Minot \n \n North Dakota's House of Representatives has passed a bill effectively outlawing abortion. The House voted 51-41 this afternoon to declare that a fertilized egg has all the rights of any person. That means a fetus could not be legally aborted without the procedure being considered murder. \n Yesterday 08:43 PM \n\n The ND personhood initiative was defeated in the Senate: North Dakota Personhood Bill Defeated in Senate, Informed Consent and Ultrasound Bills Pass . A similar personhood bill in Colorado was also soundly defeated: Colorado Personhood Amendment Defeated By Large Margin . It must really bother you that most Americans do not agree with your view and that such bills cannot pass, even in conservative states such as North Dakota or Colorado. As a pro-choice supporter, it is quite conforting to know that, even in such states, sanity can prevail.\n \n \nOn a last point, if a baby is born without functioning higher brain functions (so they do not mentally exist), then I personally would disagree with the law and not grant that mind-less baby rights since it would only be a human body at that point, not a human being. This is also relevant at the end of life if people lose all upper brain function in an illness or injury so all that remains of them is the living body with nobody home. \n\n \nThis from someone who just a few posts ago said;\n\n \nPeople can make whatever claims they like about how things SHOULD be.

What you don't have is the right to reinterpret already existing laws based on your opinion. The laws that exist do not depend on your opinion but on their purposes at the time that they were written. \n\n \nIs anyone else shaking their head in disbelief right about now? \n\n You are apparently making little effort at reading comprehension and then blaming me for your confusion. Here, I am contrasting what the law IS to what we personally think it SHOULD be. Just because the law states that all born humans have rights doesn't mean that I agree with that law since I would (1) extend those rights to late term fetuses, and (2) I would take away that right from bodies born without minds since, in both cases, it is mental existence that is and has always consistently been the most critical criteria for my own personal view about rights. Obviously, the law isn't currently structured that way and my opinion does not change what the law IS. My opinion expressed in forums such as this simply is presented, among other reasons, to play my small part in influencing the opinions of others to then influence voting patterns which might ultimately influence future laws. Laws are what the political process makes them. Opinions influence laws only indirectly (note: their influence is in changing future laws) but that indirect influence is important enough that first Amendment rights are some of our most cherished ones. I am simply exercising mine.\n \n To make it hopefully even more simply:\n Lets say a particular law A exists. It has a relatively fixed meaning and my opinion or yours will not change that fixed meaning. However, we both have a First Amendment right to express our opinions about that law. If, between our own efforts and the efforts of similar minded people, we are able to convince enough people to support that opinion, then that may influence their voting patterns which will help elect officials that will carry out the consequences of that opinion by voting in laws which support it - in this case, altering law A. So, in this way, our opinions only play an indirect role in changing what laws will say and those opinions only act on what the laws WILL BE after the political process is undertaken. Opinions do not change what the law currrently IS at the time of expression of the opinion. Laws change through the political process. \n \n On a last note, I am getting sick and tired of you posting multiple posts to each of my posts. I have already asked you to consolidate them, not only for my own good (which I know you don't care about) but for the good of the readers (which you should care about).

We in the pro-choice camp will respect the answer she gives, no matter what it might be.\n\n I agree with you that one cannot legislate a particular view of personhood unless there is widespread agreement on it. Up to now, there has not been widespread agreement on the personhood status of a fetus/embryo at various stages of development, which is why Roe vs Wade could take the stance that it did. However, that may not always be the case. In arguing here for my view of personhood (which is very similar to that of many other views here), I am simply playing my small role in trying to make that view a widespread view. This is not an impossible task. There was a time when newborn babies were killed if deemed of little value, where they were not viewed as persons worthy of rights. That changed when culture slowly changed. There are apparently still some cultures in the world that do not acknowledge young children as people. All this says is that the state of personhood beginning at birth is not something that always was and always will be \"written in stone\". It can change when cultures change. In the US, there is and has been widespread agreement from the very beginnings of our country, that born humans are people deserving rights. That stance may yet change in having its limits pushed partly into pregnancy. The failure of the North Dakota and Colorado personhood initiatives shows that most Americans, and this is a relief, would not push the idea of personhood to the beginning of pregnancy. However, I would venture to guess that most WOULD consider a very late term fetus a person. This is something that has simply not been universally addressed in politics since the Pro-Life side would never be willing to settle for that.\n \n You should also keep in mind that Roe vs Wade did not give women complete rights to abortion for ALL stages of pregnancy. It does allow the state to interfere in late term for reasons of viability, which are independent of reasons of personhood. Indeed, my understanding is that most states do limit late term abortions to certain exceptions. Though the reasons given (viability) do not coincide with my personal reasons (personhood) for limiting late term abortions, I am currently quite content with the standing of Roe vs Wade since it coincides well with my view of the state interfering in abortion rights only in the last trimester. The only concern I would have about Roe vs Wade is if new technologies would push the state of viability to earlier points in the pregnancy, allowing the state to restrict abortions at earlier terms. Luckily, that won't be a concern for quite some time.\n \n On a last note, you should not represent your extreme (abortions always allowed for whatever reason) as the general pro-choice view since most pro-choice supporters WOULD restrict third trimester abortions. Though I appreciate that you are a pro-choice supporter, I think it is important that your arguements take into account the current state of US law and opinion.",

   "You prove nothing if you do not explain what you believe an actual living human being is.\n\n Yes, Holmes, this is precisely my point. Look:\n \n \nThe only definition of human being I am using is any living human. I am not equivocating at all.\n\n Then you've purposely sidestepped the question of whether a fetus is a \"living human\" as you're using that term, despite the fact that this is the issue you pretend that you're trying to argue.\n \n \nRepeating that I am lying does not make me a liar. So far you have not actually said anything.\n\n Actually, I have. Your reasoning allows me to define the daytime sky as red and then say that the sky's color is just like that of a cherry.\n \n \nA zygote is the union of egg and sperm, correct. The other stage is an embryo.\n\n I see you got your hands on a 7th grade biology textbook. Good for you.\n \n \nA fetus is simply a much more developed zygote.\n\n No, a fetus is not \"simply\" a much more developed zygote. Try a textbook written for people capable of significant comprehension.\n \n \nIt is still a direct result of the union of egg and sperm.\n\n No, it's not. Lots of things have to happen between the time an egg is fertilized and the time a fetus exists.\n \n \nThe vast majority of all chicken eggs people buy are not fertilized. I am not wrong, I am right. You are right that a small amount are fertilized, but that amount is minute.\n\n Of course I'm right. You said that those eggs are not fertilized. Some are. Thus, you are wrong. Again.\n \n \nThat first sentence made no sense.\n\n 'Tis not my fault you can't read.\n \n \n... my point was that an unfertilized chicken egg was not similar to a fetus. Which is correct.\n\n But it was clear that you were actually arguing that the egg was not similar to a human embryo, which is not correct if the egg is fertilized. In other words, upon fixing your inability to speak like a remotely intelligent sixth-grader, your statement becomes incorrect. Thus, your wording was correct, your intended argument was not.\n \n \nNo...I said what I wanted to say. Maybe you think I wanted to say something else. What I said was what I meant to say.\n\n You were trying to argue that the acorn is not analogous to an embryo. That is incorrect. Plain and simple.\n \n You did not mean \"fetus.\" You repeatedly used the word \"fetus\" when referring to either a zygote or an embryo. If there is any confusion here, it is because of your own biological illiteracy.\n \n \nLets go over what you said in your post that wasn't just calling me stupid.\n [snip]\n I pretty much agree with everything said there.\n\n I called you WRONG. Multiple times, even. Glad to see you agree.\n \n \nYou didn't even argue against me.\n\n See, you're suffering from selective amnesia. I made it quite clear that you don't know what the hell you're talking about. I pointed out your hypocrisy for accusing others of not understanding biology and thus being incapable of arguing logically while yourself not understanding biology and thus being incapable of arguing logically. I exposed your fallacy of defining your opinion into the lexicon. I explained how your analogies are inaccurate.\n \n Now you're pretending that I've been largely agreeing with you when what I've been doing is using information (information that you acknowledge is true!) to show that your position isn't supported.\n (This is why I wasn't all that broken up about being too busy to spend time here like I used to.)",

   "Then you've purposely sidestepped the question of whether a fetus is a \"living human\" as you're using that term, despite the fact that this is the issue you pretend that you're trying to argue.\n\n I believe a fetus is a living human. I didn't sidestep any question. I stated that whenever I use the term \"human being\" I am referring to any living human. I called a fetus a human being, meaning I believe it is a living human, which biologically it is. If you would like to try and prove otherwise, please, go ahead.\n \nNo, a fetus is not \"simply\" a much more developed zygote. Try a textbook written for people capable of significant comprehension.\n \n\n A fetus is a more developed zygote, and that is a simple way to describe it. So yes, that is true. Just as an adult human is a much more developed child.\n \n'Tis not my fault you can't read.\n\n 'Tis not my fault you can't write. If you really knew what you were trying to say, you would have explained it in different words. But since you can't explain it in different words...one can only assume you don't know how to.\n \nNo, it's not. Lots of things have to happen between the time an egg is fertilized and the time a fetus exists.\n\n Yes, it is. Many things do happen between the time the egg is fertilized and the time the fetus comes into existence. But the fetus would not come into existence and none of those things would happen if it were not for the union of egg and sperm. Zygotes, embryos, fetuses, children, and adults are all the result of the union of the female egg and male sperm. The zygote is simply the first step after the initial cause.\n \nBut it was clear that you were actually arguing that the egg was not similar to a human embryo, which is not correct if the egg is fertilized. In other words, upon fixing your inability to speak like a remotely intelligent sixth-grader, your statement becomes incorrect.\n\n I stated that an UNfertilized chicken egg is not analagous to a fetus. Which is true. You then say that I \"meant\" to say embryo and because I \"meant\" to say embryo I must not have meant to say unfertilized thus I am wrong. Maybe you should argue against what I am actually saying, not what you think I want to say.\n \nYou were trying to argue that the acorn is not analogous to an embryo. That is incorrect. Plain and simple.\n\n No...I was arguing that an acorn is not analogous to a fetus. Thats why I didn't say embryo. You assume that I wanted to say something other than I wrote.\n \nI called you WRONG. Multiple times, even. Glad to see you agree.\nYou are not very good at reading the actual quotes I give you. What I find interesting is that you call me wrong but then say something I agree with to support me being wrong. Yet you never really disprove what you said was wrong.\n \nNow you're pretending that I've been largely agreeing with you when what I've been doing is using information (information that you acknowledge is true!) to show that your position isn't supported.\n\n Explain to me what you think that position of mine is. I have many positions, but you keep referencing one of them without stating what it is.\n \nI explained how your analogies are inaccurate.\n\n What you did was change my analogies so that they were incorrect and then point out I wrote them incorrectly. You are setting up a strawman. Its quite obvious.\n I stated that a seed is not analogous with a fetus. You set up a strawman stating \"A seed IS analogous with an embryo. Thats what you meant. Therefore you are wrong\". Maybe I meant what I actually wrote...its usually fair to assume that. You are attacking me saying I am wrong for something I didn't even write. If you believe what I say is wrong, go ahead and dispute it. But enough of this nonsense telling me what I meant to say. I know what I meant to say, and I said it.",

   "I believe a fetus is a living human.\n\n And I believe that this is a gross oversimplification, so gross that it sidesteps issues that are more important than word selection (and as such, should not be further complicated by poor word selection such as that demonstrated so effectively in your posts). This is hardly a position that's not understandable or unfamiliar to people who discuss this issue (or, you know, biologists).\n \n \nA fetus is a more developed zygote, and that is a simple way to describe it.\n\n Damn right that's a simple way. An overly simple way. To the point of erroneous conclusions, in fact.\n Now, I understand the need to dumb down things when talking to people who aren't very bright, but considering I'm calling you out for oversimplification, you can rest assured that I can comprehend the actual facts, as technical as they may be. I, however, am left with the impression that you may not be capable of such comprehension.\n \n \nMany things do happen between the time the egg is fertilized and the time the fetus comes into existence. But the fetus would not come into existence and none of those things would happen if it were not for the union of egg and sperm. \n\n True, but why choose those points? Why not start with insemination or germ cell genesis? Why not start with uterine implantation or the latest point at which miscarriages occur? Why not end with the development of lungs, or of higher brain function, or viability, or (god forbid) birth?\n \n \nZygotes, embryos, fetuses, children, and adults are all the result of the union of the female egg and male sperm.\n\n I can't fathom why you think I need a biology lesson. I've been correcting you. But zygotes are also a \"result\" of oogenesis and other things. (See above.)\n \n \nI stated that an UNfertilized chicken egg is not analagous to a fetus. Which is true. ...\n\n But you stated it in the context of using \"fetus\" as interchangeable with \"zygote\" and \"embryo.\" (Perhaps if you were more familiar with using context clues as a comprehension tool, you'd have seen that my conclusion about your meaning was reasonable.) That said, please do clarify what you meant by using accurate terminology based on factual information, that way our disagreements can regard your actual views instead of what you communicate.\n \n \nWhat you did was change my analogies so that they were incorrect and then point out I wrote them incorrectly. You are setting up a strawman. Its quite obvious.\n\n For the record -- in case either Lakrite or any reader were unclear about this after reading my comment immediately above this section -- my \"changing\" was not intentional but was based on my interpretation of Lakrite's unclear original statements. Lakrite -- or anyone else -- will be hard-pressed to find me purposely creating strawmen. Thus, I will forgo further responding to Lakrite's points about unfertilized eggs, fertilized eggs, acorns, zygotes, embryos, fetuses, newborns, chicks, chickens, adult humans, and trees until he can state them using words that actually mean what he intends.",
