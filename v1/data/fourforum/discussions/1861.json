   "So, all good Citizens in whatever Country can rely on their Police Force to protect them from harm & need not work on defending themselves or their families?\n I think not:\n \n Pc 'surprised' Huntley file wiped\n \n \n Huntley was hired despite prior accusations against him \n A policeman who warned Ian Huntley was a serial sex attacker has told of his surprise that his report was wiped from the Humberside Police database. \n Pc Michael Harding saw a pattern in the Soham killer's files while looking into an allegation of rape in June 1999. \n \n He told the Bichard Inquiry in central London on Monday: \"You would not put it in if it was going to be deleted.\" \n \n Pc Harding spent six hours researching the report, which was deleted as part of a \"weeding\" process in July 2000. \n \n Kate Gallafent, junior counsel to the inquiry, asked how long he would have liked his report on Huntley to have stayed on the Humberside computer system. \n \n There was no previous conviction, there was a girl who was approaching her 16th birthday... there was no force... these things go on \n \n Retired officer Peter Billam \n \n Pc Harding replied: \"Personally I would find it helpful to have it there forever. However, I do not think anyone would let us do that. \n \n \"From a data protection interpretation point of view, I cannot really answer that question.\" \n \n Sir Michael Bichard, chairing the inquiry, asked if he was surprised his report had been weeded. \n \n Pc Harding said: \"Yes. I think it's fair to say yes.\" \n \n Earlier on Monday a former detective defended his decision to take no action against Huntley over allegations of underage sex. \n \n Retired Humberside Det Insp Peter Billam said there had not been enough evidence, or the girls had not co-operated with investigations. \n \n While standing by his decisions \"at the time,\" he said with hindsight they would have been \"totally different\". \n \n The allegations did not emerge when Huntley became a school caretaker in Soham, where he went on to murder Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. \n \n 'Slept with schoolfriend' \n \n Mr Billam dealt with three allegations of underage sex against Huntley in his role as head of the Grimsby office of the child protection unit for Humberside police in the 1990s. \n \n He admitted he would have dealt with matters differently if he had linked the accusations. \n \n Under cross-examination by counsel to the inquiry James Eadie, Mr Billam accepted he dealt with the third incident just days after the decision on the second. \n \n He said he must have made some kind of link but could not remember, saying he would have had to rely on remembering Huntley's name. \n \n The Bichard Inquiry is investigating flaws in vetting procedures and police intelligence handling which allowed Huntley to get his caretaker's job. \n \n He murdered the two 10-year-olds in Soham, in Cambridgeshire, in August 2002. \n \n \n Huntley murdered Jessica and Holly and burned their bodies in 2002 \n \n The inquiry has already heard how Humberside police were made aware of 11 separate criminal allegations against Huntley. \n \n In August 1995 Huntley admitted having sex with a 15-year-old, but Mr Billam took no action because of the girl's reluctance to give a statement or make a complaint. \n \n \"There was no previous conviction, there was a girl who was approaching her 16th birthday, it was a boyfriend/girlfriend situation... there was no coercion, no force... these things go on,\" Mr Billam said. \n \n In May 1996 a second girl refused to co-operate after an allegation of underage sex was made. \n \n Mr Billam said he was not aware Huntley had been accused of sleeping with one of her schoolfriends. \n \n Lack of evidence \n \n A third case was delayed for several days because \"the child was in no danger and...staff were involved in duties of higher priority\", he said in his statement. \n \n Under cross-examination, Mr Billam said the child protection database used by the force was \"unreliable\" as an intelligence tool. \n \n \"The fact that no sensible system seems to have been set up for recording the core allegation in some searchable form seriously handicapped the proper performance of your police force,\" Mr Eadie said. \n \n \"With hindsight, possibly I would have looked at it differently,\" Mr Billam said.\n \n Personally & with experience, I have no faith whatsoever in the \"forces of Law & Order\" & their worth in protecting me & mine. :(",

I've watched some of my friends from a distant get this....\n \n Not to mention the fact they are more concerned with the fact you might gently roll through a stop at 10 o'clock at night on your way out of a subdivision rather than the fact there are a bunch of juveniles smoking pot behind the building he was parked.....sorry this was a flashback of last friday for me......\n \n I honestly hate cops and feel less comforted by their presence if anything....",

   "It's like this: the police are responsible for public peace and order, law abiding and so on. They are obliged to protect everyone. However, an individual does not have the right to demand he be singled out for protection.\n \n The US court cases have, so far as I'm aware, generally gone along the line of: individual was threatened by someone, he/she informed the police, the police didn't establish a round the clock guard of the individual, and then the one who made the threat actually did what he threatened to do. The individual, or his family, then sued the police.\n \n Essentially, the police never have enough manpower to respond to all requests for protection and they are also often called upon frivolously, so unless things appear really serious, they go for the other more serious sounding cases.\n \n Personally, while I understand the court's reasoning and generally agree with it, I also think that if the police turn out negligent, the people responsible should be held responsible.",

   "Hmmm, I wonder why it is that a number of policemen, like firemen, are trained in how to deliver babies, render assistance at the scenes of accidents, in some cases the resuscitation of heart attack victims, and so forth.\n\n \n In the US, most public service workers engaged in police, fire and emergency health care duties have been combined into one department named 'emergency services', with each sub-department having its own operations chain of command. I was told there were several justifications for consolidation, including savings from joint administration, budget submittal to city/county managers by one rather than three departments and increased specialization by each department allowing relaxed recruiting certification for police and health workers. \n \n Where I live the fire department, unless a crime has been committed, is first responder for all health and property damage emergencies. They continue to require all operational personnel be certified in emergency heath care. 911 determines if fire or medical assistance is required. Police are dispatched only if a crime has been committed. \n \n Emergency health care (ground and air ambulances) has been split off to where only formal paramedic training is required for certification, releasing the fire departments (city/county) from those duties. Prior to consolidation fire departments supplied personnel for emergency health care and management of emergency health care is still administered by fire departments.\n \n City/county police officers are no longer required to have emergency health care certification. This allows police, who have by far the largest increases in service demands, to concentrate on resolving crime issues. If one calls 911 for a minor traffic accident that doesn't impede traffic, no response will be made by a police department unless the accident has produced an injury. \n \n Some of the operating justification behind consolidations is readily apparent. Due to our (US) aging population, a majority of ever-increasing emergency health care responses require ambulance transport. Expanding emergency health care departments is far less costly using paramedics and reduces expansion of higher cost fire department personnel. Our rapidly increasing social ills requiring police attention, the 2nd highest demand against available public funds after education, are far better served operationally and financially by cops without emergency health care duties. \n \n All public services are, due to funding limitations, reactive. Those expecting a police department to protect them from criminal activity need to take a cold shower and face the real world.",
