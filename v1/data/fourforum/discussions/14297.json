That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath?  Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n Washington once noted, \"If you remove religious principles from the schools you are going to lose national morality.\" Amen, George!!\n \n Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the \"Father of Public Schools,\" once had this to offer: \"The only foundation for a republic is...religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty.\"\n \n Don't miss the significance of that last statement: &#8220;..without virtue there can be no liberty....\"  The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, \"Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings).\" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions.\n \n Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared, \"...Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue....\"\n \n And finally....\n \n How much liberty did Sodom and Gomorrah have after their Judgment?\n \n Gay sex enslaves the individuals in a prison of sin, and God's Judgment may not be far behind.

She knows I am straight.\n\n \n As you've pointed out, the US is a bit more puritanical about nudity. The assumption has historically been that sharing bathrooms/showers with the same gender is generally ok because there is no sexual attraction or tension. When that assumption is no longer true then the situations that are based upon those assumptions should be re-examined.\n \n The assumption that men can't control themselves and will attack women if there are mixed shower situation should hold true for homosexuals as well. It is justified to request separate shower facilities once homosexuality is openly discussed. This would alleviate any discomfort that heterosexual people would feel sharing facilities with those who find their gender attractive.",

One needs to weigh whether your discomfort is more important than the livelihood of homosexuals in the military. Which is the greater harm? The &#8220;individual level&#8221; of which you speak ends with you.\n\n \n I don't think you can reasonably make that conclusion. As you say: Sexuality is a significant part of who we are. Sex is one of the most concentrated source of pleasure in the living world, and it is also one of the most proscribed activities. It would be an anomoly if the sexuality of others didn't concern us. Given the state of society, it is reasonable to conclude that being in intimate situations (read: bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc) with members of the opposite sex would make most people uncomfortable, and it is also reasonable to draw a parallel with homosexual members of the same gender. Both have the same gender they are attracted to, after all. So, no, the reasoning would extend beyond one person.\n \n As to which is the greater harm? I don't know. As I mentioned, I'm delineating the trade-off that seems to be usually ignored. If we choose one trade-off over another it's all well and good as long as we are informed about what the trade-off is. Writing off the discomfort of others as \"oh well they're bigots\" chooses one trade-off over another without even realizing it. This is bad policy.\n \n \n\n Also, it is not impossible for a straight guy to be comfortable (or, at least not uncomfortable) when showering next to a gay guy. Lots of men do it all the time. You have to, at the very least, acknowledge that you have the issue here, and it is not entirely rational. Very real and very human and very common, but it&#8217;s a little nuts. We all act irrational all the time, I understand. But really now, what is the problem? \n\n \n Of course it's not impossible to be perfectly comfortable. \n \n As you mentioned, it is very real and very human and very common to be uncomfortable. It is very rational, but not necessarily applicable in modern society. Nearly all emotional reactions have a rational base. For example, feeling disgust at the thought of touching a cockaroach is rational (since they can carry diseases, etc etc) but that reaction persists even if the roach has been sanitized. It's rational, but not always applicable.\n \n \n\n Others have suggested this. I am not suggesting that here. It is not beyond the realm of imagination that it could be a partial explanation for some people some time.\n\n \n No question that bigots exist. However, it is irrational to conclude any negativity associated with homosexuality is a result of bigotry. I am not saying you think that, but I encounter that reaction more often than not.",

People have made the point that those serving now in the military share showers with those who are gay, and that ignorance is bliss in this situation.\n \n The thing that so many of you seem to be missing is that repealing DADT will not result in an overflow of gays openly serving in the military. From every gay person I have ever spoken to, their issues with DADT is not that they have to serve in the closet, but that they could lose their military career if they are ever convicted of homosexual conduct.\n \n Do you really think that a gay male in the military is going to want to suddenly tell everyone he serves with that he's gay the second DADT is repealed? Some may, but I doubt most will for obvious reasons.\n \n The main reason so many want DADT to be repealed is for job security, not so they can parade around the barracks flying the gay flag.\n \n On the original topic of this thread, it is appalling to me that repealing DADT is turned into a concern for the \"religious liberty\" of others. I've never heard of anything more hypocritical. So we have to keep our mouths shut, but the second others are faced with the notion of doing the same it's a problem. It's okay to silence us, but not you. There are many Christians sects that currently do not condemn homosexuality. Why aren't we concerned about their freedom to believe that?\n \n I am so sick and tired of the notion that gay rights somehow infringes on the rights of others. So often I hear that gays need to \"stop trying to push\" homosexuality and other related issues on others. Any time something gay is featured in the media, or there's a rally for gay rights there's always someone complaining that it's in their face. Let get real. I have heterosexuality forced on me everywhere I go. Every movie, every magazine, every TV show I come in contact with each and every day is almost completely consumed with the heterosexual lifestyle.

Contrary to Easys uninformed and unintelligent post above, that does not set precedent. The supreme court only sets precedent after hearing a case. Ruling on this does not set any precedent whatsoever. \n \n In this case, the reason they gave for the stay was that the pentagon was making \"Substantial progress\" toward putting a program in place to remove the policy on their own.

It is a victory for those who wanted the policy ended.

None of the above applies here. The supreme court has not heard the case and has not agreed to hear the case. Jurisdiction remains with the appellate court. \n \n The appellate court issued an injunction requiring the military to immediately halt its don't ask dont tell policy. This was done on the grounds that the log cabin republicans were likely to win their case. \n \n The government petitioned the supreme court to stay that injunction (stop it from taking effect). This was kind of an outside the box move for the supreme court because they did NOT find fault with the appeals court judgment that the log cabin republicans were likely to win. They basically found that the log cabin republicans were likely to win, BUT, since the pentagon already had a plan in motion to end don't ask don't tell that it would cause undue hardship on them to require an IMMEDIATE end to it. Basically the ruling boiled down to \"They are already doing it, let them do it their way\".\n \n \n The supreme court has not accepted the case for review, nor are they likely to, because it is pretty clear from their ruling that the pentagon is going to have the situation resolved before the case gets through the appeals court. There will be log licking...er...uh...log cabin republicans openly serving in the military in fairly short order. \n \n Sorry, I know it probably gave you all kinds of joy to think that you could oppress some of Gods children, but in this case the supreme court ruling really is a disaster for the anti log licking crowd.",
