This is unfair. Please state your opinion before you comment others' opinions, or simply do not comment at all.\n \n Epaphras asked wether or not we could live fullfilling lives if we were alone.

   "\n I have wondered this myself. Obviously we need others to reproduce, but in the event that one is absolutely alone, say on a deserted island, there is only one contributing factor as to how they live: Education.\n \n If a small child (never been to school) could manage to survive, I think it would be a very brutal and difficult existence. The child would have no concept as to what good and evil are. Cunning instict is the child's only tool for survival. This sounds pretty unfullfilling to me, but the child probably doesn't know what that means.\n \n I think that an educated person might be able to live a fullfulling life alone. Education being the difference. A person would hopefully have knowledge enough to build a decent shelter, create adequate tools, delusionally invent some friends to talk to, build a fire, think about philosophy, and probably have some pride in his accomplishments. Chances are that this person will probably end up feeling unfullfilled out of lonliness, but I can imagine it is possible to feel fullfilled as well.\n \n Lev\n LEVIATHAN\n\n \n For reference, that was my original post from 'What is Good'.\n \n \n Leviathan",

   "Of course people depend on people not to live but to grow both physically and mentally. People depend on people physically because there's always power in numbers. It's difficult to imagine one man building a town or city. People also depend on others mentally to learn from each other's experiences as there's more diversity and a greater chance that something will happen one person that won't happen to others. If man was alone, he would have to do the jobs of those that would be others' if there were any. He might only have time to find food and maintain shelter but have no time for developing and learning to manipulate the things around him. It is because we have the intelligence and ability to communicate and work with others that allowed us to evolve and become what we are. Also, love and tenderness between two is what propelles each of the two onwards. I believe that people need to interact to create a balance that either advances humanity forwards or withers them to nothing.",
