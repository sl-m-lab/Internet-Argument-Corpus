   "I don't think it is evidence that Jesus never existed. I think it is evidence of a mass fraud. It is one simple box that is only a lost piece of the puzzle that is a fraud. But there is hundreds of pieces that proved Jesus did exist. I think he existed... But is he the son of God I don't know. Who am I to judge that?",

   "Well, on several boards fundamentalist christians squealed with glee about this box. At last, definitive \"proof\" that Jesus lived! They claimed that this was proof that the Bible was correct and that Jesus was divine.\n \n But James, Joseph and Jesus were relatively common names, and there was no evidence that the three persons referred to on the box were the ones in the Bible. If the box had been authentic, it still would not have been very good evidence of anything.\n \n But of course, the box is a fraud. That fraud was committed by some unknown person upon Christianity. But revelation of the fraud (not by christians, by the way), removes even the hint that there is verifiable evidence that the person, Jesus, ever lived.\n \n I was contrasting that with the behavior of creationists who claim that Piltdown Man, a fraud comitted against science, is somehow evidence that the theory of evolution is wrong. If that were true, then the fact that the box is a fraud would be evidence against the existance of Jesus as solid as Piltdown.\n \n In fact, neither is evidence of anything except that people sometimes create elaborate hoaxes. The fact that Piltdown Man was a fraud removes the only bit of evidence for the origins of mankind in Great Britain. It does not speak to the volumes of evidence for the origins of mankind in other parts of the world.\n \n The debunking of the box is a bit more serious. Again the only evidence for the existance of Jesus is the New Testament.",
