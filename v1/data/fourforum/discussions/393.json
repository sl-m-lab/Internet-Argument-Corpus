   "The other thread was getting quite long and the topic was wandering so I thought I would put this question into a new thread so that everyone would be aware that Debater does, in fact, back up his claims.\n \nsince you follow darwin would it suprise you to learn that darwin's theory is based off the asumption that microbiology doesn't exist and that if microbiology was proven to exist he stated that his theory would be dead\n \n Now, I doubt that Darwin ever made such a statement, but Debater assured me that it was in \"On the Origin of Species.\" Since an edition wasn't specified, I presume that it is in all editions although I don't remember it and I can't find it. I have only the 1st and 6th editions.\n \n So Debater, please cite precisely where Darwin made such a claim. It seems logical that it might be in Chapter VI - Difficulties on Theory, and I am re-reading that chapter carefully without luck so far - but it is 19 pages long.\n \nLong before the reader has arrived at this part of my work, a crowd of difficulties will have occurred to him. Some of them are so serious that to this day I can hardly reflect on them without being in some degree staggered; but, to the best of my judgment, the greater number are only apparent, and those that are real are not, I think, fatal to the theory.\n --Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species, 6th edition, Chapter VI, Difficulties on Theory\n \n Many consider the 6th edition the definitive work.\n \n Looking forward to verification of that assertion by Debater.",

   "Plus, I don't see why creationists think that we treat Darwin as some kind of god. Sure, he started the whole ball of wax but science has moved on since then. Some of the stuff in his books are out of date and/or wrong simply for the fact that at the time, science didn't know anything about DNA or microbiology. Since then, science has discovered new ideas that Darwin would never have thought of in his time.",

   "Indeed true.\n \n My original question to Debater had two parts. Part I was the request that he substatiate his assertion (for a change). Part II was, \"Who cares?\"\n \n In fact, Darwin is not a definitive source when discussing evolution. He is of interest because he combined several theories, at least one of them original, in a way that had never been done before. His theories, when combined yet one more time with Mendel's ideas of genetics, became the basis of modern evolutionary theory. Darwin is of interest more for historical reasons than for a statement of modern theory.\n \n It's a bit like Newton in physics. Before you quote Newton you need to be aware of modern developments. Was your point superceded by Einstein or Bohr?\n \n Creationists tend to look at truth as TROOTH! That is, of course, inherited from the Platonic ideal that somewhere there exists some abstract entity that is above mere matter, and absolute in all cases and times. But science doesn't work like that. Science is a continuing process of observation, explaining, predicting, testing - and the test is another observation, whether suportive of the prediction or not.\n \n Since a typical creationist believes that his sacred scripture contains the never changing TROOTH, he tends to look at science that way. If a scientific theory has been superceded, the creationists considers that to be a weakness. If science cannot answer a question because of imperfect technology, or even the failure of physics equations when the results return infinity, to a creationist this is a weakness. Creationists have the answers to all questions even though they answer no questions.\n \n But science finds its own mistakes. Where theories are wrong, they are corrected by further research and testing. Any scientist knows that his mistakes are much more likely to be revealed by another scientist in his field than by a \"creation scientist.\" The same is true for frauds or attempted frauds. Creationists trumpet them as meaningful - but no \"creation scientist\" has ever been instrumental in revealing a scientific fraud. That work has always been done by real scientists. \"Creation scientists\" merely replay them again and again as if they were still parts of evolutionary theory.\n \n But creationism never changes. Well, that's not quite true. It took some time, but after Girodono Bruno was burned at the stake and Galileo barely managed to escape that fate for asserting that the earth was not the center of the universe, creationists have slowly changed. Modern creationists actually \"believe\" that it is a fact that the sun is the center of our solar system. It seems that some scientific theory has become TROOTH for creationists.",

   "If we turn your quotes around, we have the answer. The second that you give, the first below, is from the first paragraph of Chapter IX. Your first quote (the second below) is from the \"SUMMARY OF THE PRECEDING AND PRESENT CHAPTERS\" at the end of Chapter X. In the proper order they would be: \n[T]he number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed, [must] be truly enormous.\n \n The geological record is extremely imperfect\n\n I wonder if you actually took the time and invested the effort into reading what Darwin had to say about your problem. How did Darwin answer your problem. Are you even aware that he did? I guess not.\n \n You see, Darwin was more than an adequate geologist for his time. One of his close firends was Lyell and teachers was Sir Charles Lyell. Lyell's works on geology furnished Darwin with much of his reading while on the Beagle.\n \n The answer to the question of a lack of transitional fossils was, for Darwin, the imperfection of the geological record. And Darwin goes into great detail about it. Why don't you read on from your quote from the first paragraph of Chapter X. Possibly Darwin had more to say about it since that title of that Chapter is \"ON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD\"\n \n About your previous unsupported references to what Darwin said.\n \nI am not sure were it is in his book if it is in his book at all it may be in his diary.\n \n And It may have been in a earlier version.\n \n And since you say that the 6th edition is the definitive one well ok.\n\n Actually, you are still quibbling. First, after I told you that you were wrong you came up with the \"it may be in his diary\" bit. Later it has moved to an earlier version of OTOOS. The answer is quite simple. NOPE. I searched through The LIfe and Letters of Charles Darwin, vol I & II, More Letters of Charles Darwin, vol I & II, On the Origin of Species, 1st and 6th editions, The Autobiography of Charles Darwin, and The Voyage of the Beagle. None even contain the word \"microbiology\". Darwin made several references to microscopes and his use of them. He had one on the Beagle. But nowhere does any of that discussion refer to the impossibility of his theory.\n \n Maybe you would be so kind as to tell me where you had access to Darwin's diary. Or maybe you either made up that assertion or were just an ignorant dupe of someone like Hovind making a claim like that. Where did it come from.",
