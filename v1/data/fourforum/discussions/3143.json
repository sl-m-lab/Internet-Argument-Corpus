   "Bush's Imperialist Ambitions Detected by John Pilger - in May, 2001\n \n The big threat in the Middle East is Israel, not Iraq: it could play the nuclear card to blackmail the Americans\n \n by John Pilger, May 2001\n \n \n As George Bush escalates the new cold war begun by his father, the attention of his planners is moving to the Middle East. Stories about the threat of Iraq's \"weapons of mass destruction\" are again appearing in the American press, this time concentrating on Saddam Hussein's \"new nuclear capability\". These are refuted by the International Atomic Energy Agency, whose inspectors have found no evidence that Iraq, in its devastated state, has a nuclear weapons programme.\n \n The distraction, however, is vital. The only weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East are in Israel, an American protectorate. What is not being reported is that, as Israel's hawks fail to put down the Palestinian uprising, their leader, Ariel Sharon, may well remove the country's nuclear arsenal from its nominal strategy of \"last resort\".\n \n \"Arabs may have the oil, but we have the matches,\" said Sharon before he became prime minister. Steinbach says such a threat could be used to compel the Bush administration to act exclusively in Israel's favour were it to waver in the face of growing international support for the intifada.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://pilger.carlton.com/print/58883\n \n \n Lets Not Forget: Bush Planned Iraq 'Regime Change' Before Becoming President\n \n Neocons' Creation, Rebuilding America's Defences: Strategies, Forces And Resources For A New Century, is a Blueprint for Global Zionist Hegemony:\n \n http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article1221.htm\n \n \n Related Threads:\n \n \"Regime Change\": Not an Excuse for War\n \n Top Ten Lessons from Gulf War II\n \n \n \n .",

   "This isn't news.\n \n They have never hidden the fact. People are just too stupid to realize it.\n \n http://www.newamericancentury.org/\n \n The 1998 letter to Clinton urging \"regime change\":\n http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm\n \n\n We are writing you because we are convinced that current American policy toward Iraq is not succeeding, and that we may soon face a threat in the Middle East more serious than any we have known since the end of the Cold War. In your upcoming State of the Union Address, you have an opportunity to chart a clear and determined course for meeting this threat. We urge you to seize that opportunity, and to enunciate a new strategy that would secure the interests of the U.S. and our friends and allies around the world. That strategy should aim, above all, at the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime from power. We stand ready to offer our full support in this difficult but necessary endeavor.\n\n \n Now that would just sound too reasonable, so we have to read the next paragraph.\n \n \nThe policy of \"containment\" of Saddam Hussein has been steadily eroding over the past several months. As recent events have demonstrated, we can no longer depend on our partners in the Gulf War coalition to continue to uphold the sanctions or to punish Saddam when he blocks or evades UN inspections. Our ability to ensure that Saddam Hussein is not producing weapons of mass destruction, therefore, has substantially diminished.\n\n \n Now, if Saddam had WMDs then or even if he didn't we would have to say that from 1998-2003 the policy of \"containment\" was \"working\" as it had worked for the previous 7 years. If in the next few months Saddam had used some sort of WMD against anyone we would have to say that these people were right (but that wasn't the case). Anyway, Clinton still managed to send cruise missiles Saddam's way around that time. \n \n \nIn the long term, it means removing Saddam Hussein and his regime from power. That now needs to become the aim of American foreign policy.\n \n We urge you to articulate this aim, and to turn your Administration's attention to implementing a strategy for removing Saddam's regime from power. This will require a full complement of diplomatic, political and military efforts. Although we are fully aware of the dangers and difficulties in implementing this policy, we believe the dangers of failing to do so are far greater. We believe the U.S. has the authority under existing UN resolutions to take the necessary steps, including military steps, to protect our vital interests in the Gulf. In any case, American policy cannot continue to be crippled by a misguided insistence on unanimity in the UN Security Council.\n \n We urge you to act decisively. If you act now to end the threat of weapons of mass destruction against the U.S. or its allies, you will be acting in the most fundamental national security interests of the country. If we accept a course of weakness and drift, we put our interests and our future at risk.\n \n Sincerely,\n \n Elliott Abrams Richard L. Armitage William J. Bennett\n \n Jeffrey Bergner John Bolton Paula Dobriansky\n \n Francis Fukuyama Robert Kagan Zalmay Khalilzad\n \n William Kristol Richard Perle Peter W. Rodman\n \n Donald Rumsfeld William Schneider, Jr. Vin Weber\n \n Paul Wolfowitz R. James Woolsey Robert B. Zoellick\n\n \n I agree with the first bolding. The world is better off without Saddam in power. But that is like saying the world is better off without Kaddafi, Kim Jong Il, Yassir Arafat, Osama bin Laden, and George W. Bush in power. I mean all of these people in some way threaten world peace, but that doesn't justify killing thousands of civilians (and even soldiers) in the process of taking out the regimes militarily.\n \n The second bolding reminds us that after 9/11, the dimplomatic efforts didn't matter anymore.\n \n The last bolding reminds us that when draft dogding war mongers see diplomatic and political efforts to affect change don't work the first day it's weakness and drift. Strength comes from blowing people and their stuff up. That gets results!",

   "Lets Not Forget: Bush Planned Iraq 'Regime Change' Before Becoming President\n\n \n This isn't news at all. As a matter of fact, it's misleading. Bush didn't instigate the regime change plan.\n \n \n Bill Clinton as President of the United States, signed the Iraqi Freedom Act in 1998, making it our policy to depose Saddam Hussein (have a regime change).\n \n \n \n You Bush-bashers just seek all means, don't you?",
