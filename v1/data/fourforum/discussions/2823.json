   "Adolph Hitler, Mussolini all have similar views...\n \n \n \"The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed the subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty.\"\n -- Adolf Hitler, Hitler's Table Talks 1941-1944, Edited by H.R. Trevor-Roper (London: Widenfeld and Nicolson, 1953), pp. 425-426\n \n \n \"The measures adopted to restore public order are: First of all, the elimination of the so-called subversive elements. [...] They were elements of disorder and subversion. On the morrow of each conflict I gave the categorical order to confiscate the largest possible number of weapons of every sort and kind. This confiscation, which continues with the utmost energy, has given satisfactory results.\"\n -- Speech delivered by Prime Minister Benito Mussolini before the Italian Senate, June 8, 1923. Reproduced in Mussolini as Revealed in His Political Speeches (London & Toronto: J.M. Dent & Sons Ltd., 1923), pp. 308-309.\n \n \n \n \"A very large measure of individual liberty is not necessarily the sign of a high degree of civilisation. On the contrary, it is the limitation of this liberty, within the framework of an organisation which incorporates men of the same race, which is the real pointer to the degree of civilasation attained.\" Adolf Hitler, dinner talk on April 11, 1942, quoted in Hitler's Table Talk 1941-44: His Private Conversations, Second Edition (1973), Pg. 423. Translated by Norman Cameron and R. H. Stevens. Introduced and with a new preface by H. R. Trevor-Roper. The original German papers were known as Bormann-Vermerke. In looking for this quote in other editions or printings, please focus on the date of the talk to locate the correct page number.\n \n \"In reality, the more primitive a people is, the more it resents as an intolerable restraint any limitation of the liberty of the individual.\" Adolf Hitler, dinner talk on April 11, 1942, quoted in Hitler's Table Talk 1941-44: His Private Conversations, Second Edition (1973), Pg. 424. Translated by Norman Cameron and R. H. Stevens. Introduced and with a new preface by H. R. Trevor-Roper. The original German papers were known as Bormann-Vermerke. In looking for this quote in other editions or printings, please focus on the date of the talk to locate the correct page number.\n \n \n Also some here support brady and other groups but say they do not want a gun ban yet:\n \n \n \"We must get rid of all the guns.\"\n --Sarah Brady, speaking on behalf of Handgun Control Inc \n Phil Donahue Show, September 1994\n --- with Sheriff Jay Printz & others\n \n \"I'm convinced that we have to have federal legislation to build on. Our ultimate goal -- total control of handguns in the United States -- is going to take time. My estimate is from seven to ten years. The problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns sold in this country. The second problem is to get them all registered. And the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition -- except for the military, policemen, licensed security guards, licensed sporting clubs, and licensed gun collectors -- totally illegal.\"\n --- Nelson T. `Pete' Shields, Chairman, HCI\n \"A Reporter At Large: Handguns\",\n _The New Yorker_, July 26, 1976, 57-58\n Notice all the new licensing requirements Mr. Shields plans on creating. Creating yet more government bureaucracy.\n \n \n Also\n \n \"We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans.\"\n -- William Jefferson Clinton, USA Today, March 11, 1993.\n Excuse me? Just who's rights did Mr. Clinton swear to uphold when he took office? \n Perhaps it's only the elite Americans, like himself, that he thinks have rights. \n \n \"Waiting periods are only a step. Registration is only a step.\" \n -- Janet Reno\n \n \n \"Banning guns is an idea whose time has come.\" \n --U.S. Sen. Joseph Biden Associated Press 11/18/93\n Obviously Mr. Biden hasn't read the Constitution lately. \n \n \"Banning guns addresses a fundamental right of all Americans to feel safe.\" \n --U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein Associated Press 11/18/93\n Compare Ms. Feinstein's comments to this one: \n \"Those who would sacrifice essential liberties for a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\" \n -- Benjamin Franklin\n \n \"Until we can ban all of them we might as well ban none.\"\n --U.S. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum Senate Hearings 1993\n \n \n \"No, we are not looking at how to control criminals, we are talking about banning the AK47\n and semi-automatic guns!\" \n -- Senator Metzenbaum (D-OH), during the Constitution Subcommittee of 2/10/89\n Now we see the mentality of the prohibitionists. They don't want to control criminals, they'd rather pass laws that don't work just to show their constituents that they're doing something (even if it is useless and stupid). \n \n \n \"We're here to tell the NRA their nightmare is true!.\" \"We're going to hammer guns on the \n anvil of relentless legislative strategy! We're going to beat guns into submission!\" \n --U.S. Rep. Charles Schumer NBC Nightly News 11/30/93\n I think someone needs to remind Mr. Schumer that a gun is an inanimate object and as such cannot be beaten \"into submission\". This makes me wonder about Mr. Schumer's ability to recognize that a gun is a tool, like a hammer or saw, and is neither evil or good. It is only what a human being does with it that is evil or good. \n \n \n \"Gun registration is not enough.\"\n --U.S.Attorney General, Janet Reno on \"Good morning America,\" 12/10/93\n \n \"Mr. Speaker, I still believe that the best way to control handguns is to ban them outright.\" \n -- Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-IL)\n Yep, that's it. If you can't figure out what to do, either make it illegal or throw money at it in special programs or by funding a committee to \"study\" it. \n \n \"Our goal is to not allow anybody to buy a handgun. In the meantime, we think there ought to \n be strict licensing and regulation. Ultimately, that may mean it would require court approval to \n buy a handgun.\"\n -- Michael K. Beard, President of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence\n [Washington Times, 12/6/93, page A1] \n And you think our courts are clogged now! \n \n U.S. Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) on terrorism and self-defense: \n The following comments were made by U.S. Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) during U.S. Senate hearings on terrorism held in Washington, D.C. on April 27, 1995:\n \n \"Because less than twenty years ago I was the target of a terrorist group. It was the New World Liberation Front. They blew up power stations and put a bomb at my home when my husband was dying of cancer. And the bomb didn't detonate. ... I was very lucky. But, I thought of what might have happened. Later the same group shot out all the windows of my home.\" \n \n \"And, I know the sense of helplessness that people feel. I know the urge to arm yourself because that's what I did. I was trained in firearms. I'd walk to the hospital when my husband was sick. I carried a concealed weapon. I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going to take them with me.\" \n \n Please note that in almost all California cities it is nearly impossible for a citizen to obtain a permit to carry a concealed weapon. In fact, the City of Los Angeles did not issue a single permit for over six years with the exception of issuing one to a new police chief who was not yet certified in California. In San Francisco only those who are have influence with the police department are issued permits. In the city of San Jose (in Silicon Valley) the previous police chief refused to issue any permits at all, no matter how endangered a citizen was.\n Source: CSPAN Coverage 04/27/95.\n \n \n _____________________________\n \n \n Now all you anti's I want to know your true agenda. Your true agenda besides the typical \"reasonable gun control\" in fact I would like for you to discuss what you disaree with regarding the above quotes.",
