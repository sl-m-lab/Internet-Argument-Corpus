   "A political graph-Cauchy3.\n \n The life waits to die. All matters are different. What is the want of motive? What means purpose? It is to transform by all means. Get down but d\u00e9cor a night of jewels. Stray lives claim more options.\n \n What subjects are above prizes? But objects are all cookies that crumbled. Lives are actuated by greed with some lives.\n \n Lives are actuated by angry when pressed or opposite. Lives are actuated by fast stealing when you show off.\n \n The word honor is copy from your copy books. Authentic works are milks but seize by tricks or by forces are the butters. What are your consolation prizes?\n \n A characteristic attitude is all too common inner beings.\n Carman fantasy is frank and common. But I remember the teaching from lady white. I adopt her near words. I teach myself my own ideas. I mean that to born is a stranger. To reborn it is not earth quaking man but a baby. Are you Quaker?\n \n The wisdom of Aspasia is flowers in asparagus. Pericles are the greens of her vegetables.\n \n All courts are good results when back up with Athens. Greens and vegetables are Pericles and ASpasia. \n \n Athens Pericles enclosed a better live form when hired.\n \n But Sparta military units are worms that eat out the green loves.\n \n A queue of quick busters or a matrix of butchers is two variables.\n \n When does Pericles go down to polling? Who is the virtual king?\n Flowers, songs and gifts on streets or flatware for panics are one set.\n \n Legion, Brigade, battalion and platoon and bloods on cream boards are other sets.\n \n Stable charged political power is one up right middle spectral line. Shifting to left or right like the motive for charities or for principals! Farer to right is the higher principles.\n \n This is the graph of good moral and good political powers and judges.\n \n Peak cross section is the amounts of achievements that are the unit on y axis. \n Oscillations are also show as the tail of the bell shape graph. The faces of oscillations are stretched graph like truths.\n \n Also the conservations of powers are one whole unit. The matters of facts are how they are observed by some times. All big timers take the control of the shapes.\n \n It is good to has skew whiff. Other may also think about the heterodox rather than this orthodox political graph. Skew to left it mean self advantages like moneys and jewels. Skew to right then it mean laws and orders. \n \n When extend as asymptote to time infinitive. It turns to one small constant of eternity.\n \n --------Cheung Shun Sang=Cauchy3--------",

   "A chart of life-Cauchy3.\n \n Declare and let out or control and humanity or centre are two only psyche effects. All causes are reactions to actions. However there are three genders in languages: Masculine, feminine and neuter. \n \n Masculine are curfew laws. Feminine are all loves dramas. Neuters are equal amounts of benefits and tricks when mixed.\n \n But changes come in small, medium, large and extra sizes. Magic spells are less costly than wands.\n \n So we bet the totems with no buying. When false mixed with the genuine then fishes jump over dragon gates.\n \n As horse fly to star with genuine but no with wheels then all are ones.\n \n All wisdoms and all physiology -powers are led out by reactions to actions. It is hard to image how a new born baby creep without light, heat or touches. It may be only a heart break or crying in woes.\n \n Of course we also have to think about the treats inside ones bodies. Ratter a rigid body or a creeper that bent down will calculated with heat, light, sound, touches and peoples.\n \n As each one of us is greed for greedy lives. We are bully for bulls and bears games. We may beg for common justices of the peaces by setting up our laws. But when we lost a lot we know we had to stand on path but not knee on our own images.\n \n All knowledge is forbidden when you are not with same or not get along with full agreements.\n \n All wealth is weal when all country funds are only break in evens. All forecast on futures may be expired loves.\n \n Up down volumes are not better than new high and low in some special occasions. All under performs are well for other up performs. One pattern of single crest may good for double or triple tops.\n \n Zero is good arms. The upper trends are our good momentums and the down trends are our low down.\n \n Our lives are starts on some special zeroes. Write out your own new charts on one day.\n \n Magic are woven and silky or magic are rigid and wands. Make up your soft brains under the hard copies of your lives. While phoenix dances then tigers fix up the vice-dragon when baby sit.\n --------Cheung Shun Sang=Cauchy3-------",
