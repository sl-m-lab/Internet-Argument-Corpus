I am sure it is filled with evidentiary chapters.\n \n Actually my official response is I am not arguing against Darwin he's dead, if any of those who I have argued with on these forums wish to include quotes from origin of species or insight that Darwin wrote in their arguments they are welcome to.\n \n I have mentioned Michal Behe and Ayn Rand as third party references to my arguments and I certainly don't claim that you must go and read their books before you can possibly find my arguments unsound.\n \ndo yourself a favour, freedom. rent some books on evolution and read them so you at least have some sense of what youre arguing against.\n\n If you have read my posts and think I have an incorrect impression of the ToE you should be able to give an overview of the disconnects.\n \n Have you read the origin of species?",

   "\n The kind of genetic changes with patterns that I would expect from evolution are exactly what the theory predicts. Improvement where ever possible. Possible in this case being a mutation that provides benefit and has over 1% likelihood in the final odds.\n \n The patterns I would expect to see from an ID would be almost identical to what we see, a vast array of extremely complex machinery with detailed control systems.\n \n Does that mean ID is proven? No. If you think so you need to stop reading the evolutionists version if the dictionary.\n \n Proof of a theory != evidence supporting it (i.e. one or more of it's predictions are fulfilled)\n \n I said as much above.\n \n The only pattern you would see from a designer is design, however since evolution claims to be the theory by witch design arises from variation and selection the predictions tend to be identical on all fronts, especially when you realize that only an imbecile would ignore rational evolution just because there was an ID.\n \n Now, don't be confused with the typical anti-ID observations like 'this is broken why would he do that' or 'why would he create this'.\n \n They are clearly designed against one sort of designer, one who is capable of producing a perfect life form and capable of repairing any damage in real time without anyone noticing.\n \n This designer fits the description of a monotheistic God intent upon never letting anyone on earth know he exists.\n \n Yea, that's true. I thought about using that against irrational evolution but it's been tried so many times that even if I correctly stated the argument the opponent's arrogance would prevent them from considering it telling themselves something like 'Oh I heard this before it's just a childish attempt to turn their own problem against us'.\n \n Also I have noted that there is a range of terminologies but arguments are often about the same thing.\n \n All the failed attempts to show me experiments which proved irrational evolution could happen are pretty much equivalent to making this point.\n \n\n Why do we say that evolution makes predictions? Wouldn't that contradict the idea that evolution is largely a product of continuous random mutations (which is observable today), and the effect of those mutations on the survivability of the organism within its environment (which may also randomly change, and is still changing today)?\n \n \n As far as ID is concerned, our observation is limited to organisms that are not in the process of being altered or redesigned, because the design process took place at the time of creation. The organism was created completely functional, and there should be no observable change to any organism right now. However, since we cannot scientifically speculate what was going through the creator's head at the time of creation, we can only assume that he knew what he was doing and that he had a reason for creating what he did and how he did it. \n \n As far as predictions go, the only thing common about ID and evolution\n is that there shouldn't be any predictions. \n \n \n\n Yes good point.\n \n It is like asking 'assume a train in Nebraska is floating', now how is it doing that?\n \n All you will get is a list of hypothesis.\n \n \n I have heard the story, I'm afraid hard work is not a guarantee of correctness.\n \n If you see a car sitting in a lot you would assume it had a designer (now I don't want to hear that ridiculous line like 'I wouldn't' or a pseudo-red herring like 'yea cause I know they had designers)\n \n The existance of a machine is inferential evidence for a designer.\n \n There are only two types of machines in the known universe, machines we build, and machines cells build.\n \n We know that the first kind has designers, it is an inductive generalization to say the second does.\n \n Nothing can remove that induction but an alternate theory may mean a deductive piece of knowledge can replace it.\n \n \n What you call a good idea is not what I call a good idea. I hold these fairy tales about how various items evolved just as meaningless as quoting genesis for evidence.\n \n They all have one thing in common phrases that contain the entire substance of evolution like 'became', 'adapted' , and 'gained the ability' that is hardly specified.\n \n The rest of the articles (those parts that aren't utterly irrelevant) are justifications for those phrases, that tends to take the form of 'it would help' basically giving an argument for why there was selection pressure.\n \n This works only when you assume that the structures in question can always be changed in small increments which are never too hard to stumble upon by random mutation.\n \n That assumption which Darwin held is wrong.\n \n\n Wouldn't the inverse be the case for ID? That organisms can never change by any means at all, since the original design was complete at the onset?\n \n \nI have not.\n \n \n Designed for and evolved for have become equivalent because evolution is supposed to produce designs.\n\n We have to let go the notion that any changes to any organisms we can observe have a \"purpose\" in the sense of a premeditated or directed function or objective. \"Evolved for\" in that sense is an oxymoron, and \"designed for\" presumes that we are aware of the motives of the creator at the time of creation.",

A problem when they begin with a priori convictions. \n \n \nHow could Morton have managed to misinterpret these data so drastically? Pulling no punches, Gould argues that Morton&#8217;s interpretation represents nothing more than &#8216;&#8216;a patchwork of fudging and finagling in the clear interest of controlling a priori convictions.&#8217;&#8217; In other words, Morton knew what he wanted to prove and he simply massaged the data until they appeared to yield the conclusion he desired. Some of the fudging and finagling that Gould identifes is so blatantly obvious that we must wonder how Morton himself managed to remain blind to it. For example, Gould notes that &#8216;&#8216;Morton often chose to include or delete large subsamples in order to match group averages with prior expectations.&#8217;&#8217;\n \n Hence, when a particular racial subgroup, say the Inca Peruvians, showed average skull sizes that were below the average for their racial group (North and South American Indians in general) they were included in the sample of all Indians in order to drive down the overall average. But when another racial subgroup, say Hindus, showed average skull sizes that were below the average for their racial group (Caucasians) they were excluded from the sample of all Caucasians in order to drive up the overall average. The result, of course, was to make it appear as though Caucasians on average had bigger skulls than Indians on average&#8212;precisely the claim Morton was trying to establish.\n From On our minds: How evolutionary psychology is reshaping the nature-versus nurture debate by Eric Gander\n\n \n When you torture the data long enough, it will eventually confess. Morton's work in this area demonstrates a hokey scientific method. The underlined part does not align with the scientific method. When the data, observations, evidence, etc. do not fit or prove the hypothesis, it's 'back to the ole drawing board.' The scientific method is excellent & when used it leads to new hypotheses to examine & explore. Science never stops looking, it is a holy curiosity. \n \n This is the book referenced above: Gould's Mismeasure of Man. He reveals mathematical & statistical errors in addition to his selective use of data. \n \n \nThe Mismeasure of Man is a 1981 book written by the Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. The book is a history and critique of the methods and motivations underlying biological determinism, the belief that \"the social and economic differences between human groups &#8212; primarily races, classes, and sexes &#8212; arise from inherited, inborn distinctions and that society, in this sense, is an accurate reflection of biology.\"[1]\n \n The book also critiques the principal theme of biological determinism, that \"worth can be assigned to individuals and groups by measuring intelligence as a single quantity.\" Gould discusses two prominent techniques used to measure such a quantity, craniometry and psychological testing. Gould describes these methods as suffering from \"two deep fallacies\". The first fallacy is of reification, that is, \"our tendency to convert abstract concepts into entities.\" These entities include IQ (the intelligence quotient) and g (the general intelligence factor), which have been the cornerstone of much intelligence research. The second fallacy is one of ranking, or our \"propensity for ordering complex variation as a gradual ascending scale\".\n Wikipedia\n\n \n The Scientific method also relies on peer review (big time). \n \n What would that look like in the 'organized religious method'?\n \n \"You're reading the wrong book! My book says ...\" \n \n \"You're worshipping the wrong God! My God says ...\" \n \n \"There is only one way! (& it just so happens to be MY way.\" I say ...\"\n \n & so on, ad nauseum, ad infinity.\n \n Back to the OP: I look at these kinds of questions as starting out with a priori convictions, either one view or the other, & with all the problems inherent, especially when there's no peer review.\n \n It's like 'Nero fiddling while Rome burns.'\n \n C'monalready, let's look at questions we can get closer to solving & that show benefit.\n \n (It's a little worrisome that some religionists feel The Rapture would show benefit.)",

The moths were either brown or grey. They lived on birch tree trunks and branches. Because of this, the grey moths were much better camouflaged than the brown ones, and within the species the allele that dictated the grey color became more frequent. However, coal-powered industrial plants were erected in the area, and the smog covered the branches, making the lighter grey moths much easier for predators to spot.

I don't have to prove to you that they don't, you have to prove that they do. You haven't done this, and just keep repeating the claim. Its not working. \n\n I claimed that the word advancement had a certain meaning in the context of evolution, the application of 'moving forward' seems very apparent to me, if it does not to you I am sorry but I can't do anything about that. If someone claims that a word is not what it is defined to be... If it bothers you so intensely you can come up with a good reason why it does not have that meaning.\n \n \nOnce again, you calling evolution irrational makes it so? Are you saying that organisms never gain novel functions?\n\n I defined the term irrational evolution because you could not parse the phrase for yourself.\n \n I have given reason.\n \n That is what I meant when I used the word novel. I don't know what you've been reading....\n \n \n \nWell I have proven you wrong, many times.\n\n I disagree.\n \nAnd by me saying so, I'm right. Just playing by your rules. \n\n Perhaps if you can convince me that I didn't actually give any reasons and that I am appealing to my own authority (You won't)...\n \n \nThis is not a new tactic, by the way. Very often I see this from debaters who have little knowledge about the topic they are discussing. They chant their preconceived conclusions over and over like a broken record, awkardly try to dodge any questions that would require them to actually know what they're talking about, then attempt to misdirect the debate by looking for semantic loopholes they can jump through to avoid actually dealing with the issue. Can't say I'm surprised. \n\n Then do not be surprised. I would not be arguing here if I could be shaken by such language.\n \n \nGive me a single instance of an ecology reaching a population balance.\n\n You never did predator/prey population growth equations in school?\n \n Suppose you asked for only a single instance..\n \n Ok in Norway there are these tiny little islands all over the Bergen area water ways.\n \n There are two or three pines on some of the islands.\n \n There can be no more than that on the island, yet if one falls down it is replaced. This max population of pines is a population balance.\n \n Why do these pine trees become well adapted only when another tree falls.\n \n \nwheels add friction, cause drag, are larger and heavier than legs, not to mention turning would be a pain in the butt for a cheetah, since to have wheels you need an axle which is stationary. not to mention that in order to have wheels, you have two options: either have a motor to go with it (which would be heavy and quite inefficient to begin with) or have the front legs - assuming the cheetah has wheels on its hind legs only - do the propelling and the wheels follow...which would be incredibly inefficient and cause a lot of strain on the cheetah's front legs. remember, humans try to match the efficiency of animal's speed through cars, but they all fall far short.\n\n Legs require energy simply to stand in a non locked state, they consume energy by the un-conserved replacement motion, mussels are motors, you mean a rotary motor which doesn't exist at the macroscopic level, there is no reason to assume a rotary motor is less efficient than a contracting motor and it isn't.\n \n Remember, combustion engines are the object in cars that is inefficient with energy not wheels.\n \n Consider the efficiency of a bicycle.\n \nand i see what youre saying about a bimb, it doesnt exist, you just made it up for the purposes of the illustration. but to be honest, i dont see the point. you know that novel features dont just appear - everyone knows that. it has to evolve from a pre-existing feature. so why are we arguing?\n\n Well a novel function can't 'evolve' from a pre-existing function. Evolve meaning a process and prediction of a theory as opposed to random chance.\n \n i.e. it can't be a guided formation.\n \n \nand asking why animals havent developed new novel machine-like features is a bit silly\n\n Not quite, It is an easy point to get around simply say that if the circumstances were right it could happen.\n \n To believe in irrational evolution is to admit there are no operational systems which cannot be formed by evolution given enough mutation events.\n \n \nI was attempting to get you to refocus on the original question posed here in this thread:\n\n I see, that would be good. In my own defense I am pretty sure I did not bring up the subject of evolution.\n \n \nI was attempting to get you to apply your own definition to your own theory (whether or not you call it intelligent design or by any other name).\n\n Did you just call ID a theory? I thought theory meant it was practically scientific fact.\n \n O.K. I am sorry I couldn't resist that one.\n \n I don't have any theory I have been arguing against irrational evolution and I came here and answered some questions because accipter went through the trouble of directing me here from another thread.\n \n I've been watching. \n \n \nC'monalready? Isn't this just 'spinning your own wheels'?\n \n Isn't this just more of the same o lame o mental masturbation strategies & where does that leave us? I view these types of questions as a kindof restating of the questions: Do the Gods exist? Or, do they not? How far are you going to get with this? Especially when apologists for either side begin with a priori convictions. \n \n I've observed better (more USEFUL) results within my own lifetime when individuals use the scientific thought process, method & more. \n\n No comment.\n \n \nI see you do not know what the logical fallacy known as a 'Ad hominem' is. An Ad hominem is when you say someone's argument is wrong because of a personal trait they specifically have.\n\n It does not have to be a trait, it could be a circumstance (forget that point if you make no distinction between the two)\n \n In this case you asserted I was am fraudulent which is a trait you claim I have.\n \n If you would have said my argument was a fraud and that only it would merely have been argument by dismissal.\n \n If you had said my argument was a fraud and then further given justification as being a circumstance or trait of mine I would have extended the ad hominem to that statement as well.\n \nIn this case, this is a pure insult.. and justly made too\n\n Sorry I am a trained monkey I look for arguments in posts on a debate forum. Yes I know it wasn't an argument it was you wasting your time and any one's time who read your comment.\n \n Perhaps there is a better way but I have learned that simply ignoring posts even the useless ones tends to lead to a great deal of confusion.\n \n Insane people such as you sometimes get it in their heads that they have been arguing and take my ignorance of their posts to mean I have no response and so their argument is won.\n \n I do certainly ignore posts and I can do so for you but I type faster than I think meaning responding to your 'making fun' isn't nearly as much work as actually arguing. It seems easy actually. Furthermore provided you continue to remain absent from actual debate I am free to ignore you should I become tired of responding.\n \n \nI happened on to this lecture by Dr. Donald Prothero and I thought you guys might enjoy it to.\n \n http://www.skeptic.com/lectures/samples/av154/\n \n No freedom I did not post it for you to view since you are clearly beyond reason.\n\n Perhaps I will try to understand it with my brutish religious arrogance anyway...",

But wheels are largely biologically unfeasible, as they require one part of the organism (the axle) to be entirely physically separate from the other part (the wheel).

   "humans are exempt from evolution. instead of changing to suit our environment, weve changed our environment to suit us. weve developed medicine and other technologies to aide people who (and i know this sounds morbid) should have succumb to natural selection.\n \n on top of that, if someone were to have a mutation that would help them with natural selection, say larger ears to hear better, the chances of them mating would actually be lower due to, imo the media and people's preception of attractiveness and even what is normal. ie someone with big ears is less attractive than someone with normal sized ears and may possibly have trouble finding a mate whereas in the animal kingdom, either animals dont care or they actually prefer a mate with mutations which will aide their children.\n \n so saying that, building a society on Darwinism would be terrible. weve evolved the greatest tool - the intelligent brain which has helped us to overcome natural selection and evolution, and thats a good thing for us.\n\n \n I'm not quite sure how it could be possible for human beings to exempt themselves from evolution? It may not always be a fair game, however... it IS the only game in town!\n \n & that would be akin to somehow denying our human nature? (Actually Steven Pinker wrote a book addressing some of these types of questions & more - The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature.)\n \n Although I certainly agree that an important part of human evolution has been the development & the increasing sophistication of tools. In another thread I responded to Floger:\n \n Although I don&#8217;t agree with your reasoning re: human nature. Human nature continues to evolve. You have focused on the one element of human nature you describe being \"humans will always destroy each other\". We have survived at least a few million years, have we not? Perhaps there is more at play here? \n \n Compared to many other species, human beings are weak & physically fragile. We haven&#8217;t developed fangs to fight predators or the combination of fangs & speed required to chase down prey. We haven&#8217;t developed fur or thick protective skins to shield us from extremes in the environment. \n \n What we have developed are cultures, communities & societies which rely on critical thinking, communication skills, the sciences, medicine, technology, the arts, etc. to adapt to the ever-changing environment. All of these skills, traits, etc. are reflected by an evolving human nature. The art of medicine grows with knowledge. The art of science advances with discovery. Improved technologies replace the old. Products become better with improved design. Empires, countries, entire civilizations go through periods of renaissance & decay & sometimes even vanish completely. All of these things combined have resulted in our continued existence here. \n \n All of these &#8216;adaptations&#8217; have assisted us in our ability to protect ourselves, adapt to an ever-changing environment, & increased our ability to pass on these survival strategies to the next generation & the next & the next & so on.\n \n Joseph M. Whitmeyer is doing some fascinating research in this area:\n \n \nAbstract: In this article I argue for endogamy as a fundamental cause of human behavior that is often classified as ethnic. Specifically, I show that it would make evolutionary sense for people to help possible co-progenitors of their descendants. This suggests that in many situations people will help preferentially the minimal endogamous set of people to which they belong. Such help mostly will be restricted to providing benefits that are nearly 'non-rival'--benefits which group members can 'consume' without making others consume less. This (partial) explanation of pro-ethny behavior reconciles key points from various approaches to ethnicity. It also agrees with many empirical observations, such as the link between endogamy and ethnicity and the variability of criteria for ethnicity. This explanation yields predictions and explanations in a number of problematic areas. For example, it suggests that expansion of the marriage pool, often occurring as a result of urbanization, is a crucial factor in the transformation of local identities into nationalism.\n Whitmeyer, Joseph M. 1997. \"Endogamy as a Basis for Ethnic Behavior.\" Sociological Theory 15(2):162-178.\n http://www.uncc.edu/jwhitmey/article.htm\n \n \n His work seems to suggest that by contributing to the benefits of the whole or the 'group' (that is, your society, community, tribe, etc.) you are essentially providing benefits for genetic offspring both in the present & in the near & distant future. This 'strategy' may be favored by evolution & therefore spread.\n \n His work also offers hope for solutions to the long present problems associated with ethnic & nationalist conflicts throughout the present world & observable & reflected by human history in general.",

One group will continue to pick up lower intelligence individuals, while the higher intelligence individuals will tend to move out of these groups. \n \n In the U.S., the perception of Asians tends to be that they have a higher intelligence.

I don't want to be obnoxious here (not really my style emoticon_xbye) however, where is the evidence that leads to the conclusion that human beings in any country have managed to exempt themselves from physical evolution? We still have body parts (mostly internal ones) that, when removed, human beings continue to survive with no discernible detriment. How would one know  that human beings are exempted?\n \n \nNo theory ever solves all the puzzles with which it is confronted at a given time; nor are the solutions already achieved often perfect. On the contrary, it is just the incompleteness and imperfection of the existing data-theory fit that, at any given time, define many of the puzzles that characterize normal science. If any and every failure to fit were ground for theory rejection, all theories ought to be rejected at all times. On the other hand, if only severe failure to fit justifies theory rejection, then the Popperians will require some criterion of 'improbability' or of 'degree of falsification.' In developing one they will almost certainly encounter the same network of difficulties that has haunted the advocates of the various probabilistic verification theories (that the evaluative theory cannot itself be legitimated without appeal to another evaluative theory, leading to regress).\n -The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n\n \n A belief system, theory, narrative, story, myth or whatever seems to be the way people make sense of the world around them.

People have different ways of looking & seeing & 'making sense of'. I'm not quite sure (uncertain) any one way will make any more sense to all than any other one way.\n \n Maybe, more simply, an evaluation or assessment can take the form of simply asking the question: Does it make better sense of the evidence? \n \n In addition, I think it may be possible to evaluate a belief system, theory, story or myth based on: what they accomplish, their merits, their strengths, their weaknesses, their success in marketing or whatever other value or quality. & even that's up for grabs because I don't think measurement is necessarily the same thing as understanding. \n \n Uncertainty is all we have.

ID got beat by the judicial system because of it's alleged affiliation with creationism. wikipedia it.\n look at this graph which pertains to, i assume your favorite textbook, of pandas and people: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Pandas_text_analysis.png/737px-Pandas_text_analysis.png\n in the 80s, a series of lawsuits ended in schools not being allowed to teach creationism in schools, and as we all know, creationists are not ones to shake hands and say 'good game', but they reacted by ditching the word creationism and replacing it with the words intelligent design - simply to get their pseudo-science 'theory' taught in schools - simply to attack Darwin and his theory - simply because Darwin's theory contradicted the bible's creation story - simply because religious people cant live and let live, knowing that students are being taught religious contradiction. not to say that you are arguing in favour of religion, all ID supporters say the same, but thats essentially why ID was created - to inject scientific lingo into their creation 'theory' to push people into being religious. please, dont try to tell me there's a difference, ive studied this a lot. but regardless.\n \n you still havent explained the questions youve brought up. who is this designer? how did he design all of this? when did he design it? why did he design it? how did he come about? evidence to support. not saying you have to answer these in order for me to consider ID a theory, but these questions have been opened for a very long time now and no one has bothered to try and answer them - because theyre unanswerable. that's why ID is pseudo-science, among other things; there is no explanation involved; nothing is more clearly understood, in fact youve just muddied up the whole question of 'how did we come about?'. so go tell Dembsky and Behe to answer those questions and provide hard, testable evidence that supports the answers for them for a bloke named Bennedict and i'll retract everything ive said about ID and subsequently join a church.",

   "How did human beings accomplish that? I don't want to be obnoxious here (not really my style emoticon_xbye) however, where is the evidence that leads to the conclusion that human beings in any country have managed to exempt themselves from physical evolution? We still have body parts (mostly internal ones) that, when removed, human beings continue to survive with no discernible detriment. How would one know  that human beings are exempted? \n\n \n ive explained already. weve developed technologies to help those who, (i feel like a jerk saying this) by natural selection should not have been able to pass on their genes, but have and thus as databed has pointed out, more genetic defects have arisen. and reproduction in the first world relies almost entirely on who we choose to mate with, and as i pointed out, our idea of a physically attractive mate is not one with an odd genetic mutation that will aide them in natural selection. if we were constantly in a territorial battle like many animals are, those with thicker skin would survive better and reproduce to spread on their thick skin genes. in reality, a thin skinned person has an equal chance of reproducing as a thick skinned person, so no mutation arises over the other. take hair thickness in a cold climate for instance. if we didnt have houses and the ability to make jackets, those with thicker hair would survive better than those with thin hair. in reality, we have houses and jackets and boots, so cold weather is really not a big concern. in fact, im convinced that we are even able to live in canada or northern united states because of our ability to build houses. without that ability, we would be living in south america on the beach. damn abilities!!\n \n one more revision, i promise. humans in developed countries are exempt from physical natural selection.\n \n \nA belief system, theory, narrative, story, myth or whatever seems to be the way people make sense of the world around them. People may call it by different names although it just seems (to me) to be an attempt to make sense of evidence based on observations, experiences, experiments & in living it. People have different ways of looking & seeing & 'making sense of'. I'm not quite sure (uncertain) any one way will make any more sense to all than any other one way.\n \n Maybe, more simply, an evaluation or assessment can take the form of simply asking the question: Does it make better sense of the evidence? \n \n In addition, I think it may be possible to evaluate a belief system, theory, story or myth based on: what they accomplish, their merits, their strengths, their weaknesses, their success in marketing or whatever other value or quality. & even that's up for grabs because I don't think measurement is necessarily the same thing as understanding. \n \n Uncertainty is all we have. We get to live it. \n \n That's my take on it anyway. I like the living part, with eyes wide open, along with curiosity & desire.\n\n \n yes. make sense of...ie explain, in reference to my previous posts. and thats exactly why i dont consider ID a theory, because forget about making sense of the evidence, there is no evidence to begin with. there are no observations or experiments, i highly doubt there were any real experiences, but religious people tend to disagree with me, but i have to give it to them, they do 'live it'. however, that doesnt make for a very powerful argument.\n \n i know there is an intelligent designer because i am living evidence.",

No argument there. There are even species in the animal world that use tools. It's the idea that the use of tools exempts a species from evolution that nettles. Even if one could identify traits passed on to offspring & identify a survival benefit, how could the claim be made from the point of view of existing in somesortof vacuum (a non-changing environment)? That is, there are so many factors involved! Evolution takes a long, long, time. Many generations. & all the while, the ever-changing environment.\n \n A variable cannot explain a constant; only a constant can explain a constant. Where are the constants in an ever-changing environment? There are many things we do not know (understatement). We are part of the long, long, long term 'experiment.' Welcome to the Monkey House.\n \n Now obviously (I find I very often have to state the obvious) I believe the theories of evolution make better sense of the evidence. I just don't quite get the part where we have succeeded in exempting ourselves from the rules of the game? \n \n Again obviously, the theories of evolution are more USEFUL than the other frameworks. I think of human cultures, communities & societies relying on critical thinking, communication skills, the sciences, medicine, technology, the arts, etc as being very valuable tools designed or developed to assist in various functions (providing benefits galore). \n \n However, it is possible to misuse a tool. Or that a tool can be used for the wrong purpose. & in the process, the tool can become destructive rather than constructive. In the process, the tool itself can become damaged or even destroyed. Sometimes it seems (to me) as if the tools are using the people rather than the people using the tools (of understanding) to build bridges (of understanding). \n \n It may be time to take a long, hard look at these damaged tools? These punctured myths? Maybe we need to fine-tune our tools? Maybe we should take a look at the elisions? What are we leaving out? What have we missed? \"No theory ever solves all the puzzles ...\" The scientific method, when used doesn't necessarily lead to solutions, what it DOES succeed in doing is to \"define many of the puzzles that characterize normal science.\" That is, NEW puzzles to explore! \n \n \nyes. make sense of...ie explain, in reference to my previous posts. and thats exactly why i dont consider ID a theory, because forget about making sense of the evidence, there is no evidence to begin with. there are no observations or experiments, i highly doubt there were any real experiences, but religious people tend to disagree with me, but i have to give it to them, they do 'live it'. however, that doesnt make for a very powerful argument.\n \n i know there is an intelligent designer because i am living evidence.\n\n \n Well, I agree with your assessment of organized religion. I think it's yet another example of the tools using the people, rather than the people using the tools. Fr'instance, when organized religion is used for political agendas with little benefit. The tool is damaged, perhaps beyond repair.",

Darwin was motivated by the evidence he saw. religion wasn't a matter to him, he put science first. but, of course ID's only existence is to abolish Darwinism, they dont look at any evidence because of course they dont have any evidence, and no designer has been observed, so tell me, how can ID not be invalid?\n \n and im not saying the questions you bring up are unanswerable because you cant answer them, no one can answer them and no one tries to answer them. theyre unanswerable because you need evidence, observations, experiments, etc for a scientific answer, and ID has none of those, so it's entire foundation lies on something that doesnt have any evidence to prove itself. it may be there, it may not be. that's not how we organize a theory. we dont insert an element required for the theory's validity that may not even exist.\n \n of course Darwin didnt know how cells worked, he didnt have that type of technology. he could have based his arguments off of something else without assuming that cells work a certain way. in fact, he did base his arguments off of many other things.

   "I have to admit I haven't been reading your responses very closely - the sophistry tends to become tiresome. However this one statement above just jumped out at me.\n \n You seem to be claiming that \"Darwin was motivated by the need to destroy all religion?\"\n \n I don't agree.\n \n imho, Darwin was motivated way more by his own curiosity & the desire to discuss/explain evolutionary change. (Understatement coming) his theories made better sense of the evidence.\n\n Perhaps you should read more closely, but thank you for realizing and admitting to your mistake. In all honesty I wouldn't have corrected you because you aren't arguing with me.\n \n \nif you go up to a scientist and present Lost as evidence for your designer, youll get laughed at. analogies dont work well as evidence. thanks for fixing that, btw.\n\n The analogy was not meant as evidence.\n \n \nthe generalization that machines are designed...well machines arent biological.\n\n Actually biology is composed of machines, if you are confused look up the general definition of machine.\n \n \nevery organism has variations from the others in it's species, the more that organism reproduces, the more variations occur. variation, reproduction, natural selection, sexual selection, habitat differences, all observable facts by themselves can be used as evidence against a designer.\n\n Ah, the fundamental shift in your position I was expecting.\n \n As I said before there is no good reason for evolution and ID to be exclusive to each other, but both sides tend to assert that because they are both trying to use the dichotomy to prove their side.\n \n Your previous position was based on the premise that there is absolutely no evidence for design, yet this shift shows (I don't care if you admit it) that in some way you cede to the generalization I spoke of.\n \n Given that there is evidence for design there must now be evidence against or proof of evolution to maintain your total dismissal of ID as a theory.\n \n Hence this paragraph!\n \n Ah but the actual rebuttal is quite easy. Why would any of these biological events be evidence against a designer?\n \n \nwhat youve made is a guess, not display evidence.\n\n It is inductive I know, that does not make it a 'guess' in the typical meaning of the word. Do not labor under the misconception that evolution is in anyway deductively proven, and that is the only way to totally negate a cogent inductive argument.\n \n \nlife is NOT too complicated to have evolved. the evolutionary process can very well explain how complexity has evolved. heres a video which im sure you wont watch, because you have a strange vendetta against research and learning, but at least i can say i tried showing you. its quite long but is eloquent in explaining things that you should know, including this irriducable complexity ID proponents argue.\n\n I have made detailed lengthy arguments throughout the subject of IC in other threads, thanks to databed and peeling I believe the vast majority of valid topics have been explored.\n \n I will not repeat everything I have said in the same detail until you promise me that you have made an effort to read the relevant threads and believe I did not address your points, even so I will not move this thread about ID about evolution (and yes that debate will take over it's very long if you insist on repeating it)\n \n \nand i have to bring up evolution in an argument about the validity of ID because thats essentially what ID is about.\n\n So then you accept the premise that if evolution was 'debunked' ID would be correct?\n \n @Trebor, thank you for your effort but I believe benedict already understood my point.\n \n @Bennedict, well I have more time to respond than I thought. I will watch and respond to the video.\n \n Please note that does not mean I changed my mind and wish to argue about evolution here.\n \n If this is the direction you want to pursue please make your response copy the text and post it in one of the threads about evolution and it's evidence, preferably in 'there is absolutely...' or 'erv's matched to...' as they already contain much of my discourse on the subject, or you could make a new thread if you really want to start on a fresh slate.\n \n 1.00 - Love the token religious fellow ;)\n \n 28.40 - Very surprising, I will investigate.\n \n Of course theory has many definitions but I doubt Behe was using a non-scientific one such as \"a particular conception or view of something to be done or of the method of doing it; a system of rules or principles. \".\n \n 35.30 I cannot say what motivation or purpose those at the trial had for ignoring the evidence presented but my reason (as I gave it in the ERV thread) was that such evidence is in support, these days up to the level of proof for common descent.\n \n Common descent is a prediction of evolution so this is evidence for evolution, it is however not proof of evolution nor is it exclusive of ID therefore it is a tertiary point at best.\n \n 40.35 Oh the good old days with databed. Yes he posted this particular segment of this video (I think).\n \n I am faced with a dilemma now, the more summarized I make my response the more likely that you will misunderstand and waste my time with a counter-response that was formed off that misunderstanding.\n \n Alright I will try to do it extremely summarized, if you are absolutely sure you know what I mean respond (but not in this thread).... else review what I have written on this very subject in the threads about evolution's evidence.\n \n In essence ken miller appears to take apart Behe's definition by showing these 'components' are indeed functional, btw this general argument ends up getting called co-option in the extended debates.\n \n The truth is they are not functional as far as natural selection is concerned, they have function but not the one that it was claimed evolved. This is eminently relevant because no selection event could ever modify it based on a function which it is not fulfilling.\n \n The result of this line of reasoning is the general rule that if any components ever did combine to form a new system with a novel function it would be by pure chance, random luck ect..\n \n It is randomness without a filter, simply a type of randomness that is conceptually less absurd than the universal randomness of mutation.\n \n Given some thought however you will realize only by taking as a premise that as a universal physical reality some biological structures are pieces of other structures can you make a claim about the difference in odds between this and spontaneous formation.\n \n You might be tempted to say \"Well I can take that premise because we see it, the flagellum is such an example\".\n \n In which case I will have to remind you of something you said which didn't actually apply to ID but does here.\n \n A theory must give explanation it cannot merely assume something is true because that thing is coherent with some data.\n \n i.e. you find a ripple on the water what kind of theory would it be to say that ripples just exist and yet ignore the stone dropping or all the other ripples?\n \n To clarify consider this, suppose we found an example of a complex system forming spontaneously in a single mutation.\n \n Can we assume that this event is now non-random because it happened? No we cannot, it remains random and will remain random until a theory is put forth to explain it's pattern.\n \n The same is the case for this co-option, again me and peeling had quite a debate about a tentative theory he was implying to that effect.\n \n 42.24 Ken miller incorrectly summarized Behe's argument.\n \n He says 'because the individual parts have no function of their own', the actual argument would be worded 'because the individual components do not have the same function'.\n \n Behe could not more guarantee that components of a biological system have no function than Miller can guarantee there is a co-option tree.\n \n Further it is not sufficient for all the 'parts' to exist in the DNA, the constructor sequences must also exist, and these along with control systems are often the components that cannot be explained even by the fallacious appeal to co-option.\n \n Again I urge you to read the full debates on this, I am 99% sure you are even now thinking of a counter which I have already responded to.\n \n With all due humility I won the debate on the flagellum so completly that I actually found a contradiction in the co-option theory time-line in an article that was posted to convince me on the type III secretory system.\n \n 51.11 Evidence? A proposed evolutionary pathway will never be evidence. I am assuming he is paraphrasing else Behe is not very careful about choosing is words on the stand.\n \n I see a repeated pattern of evolutionary story followed by 'look these DNA sequences are similar I was right'.\n \n An argument does not become more convincing just because you take it from the abstract and attempt to apply it to the specific.\n \n 51.23 - Miller accidentally says evolution when he means ID, this is the sort of phrase snatching that I am expecting to find of Behe's so called quotes as I have read two of his books and they convey nothing of the sort.\n \n 53 - I missed the part where he proved ID was a religious idea.\n \n 53.40 - The judge is wrong, reality forces a choice between Religion and science, a school board or a judge lack the ability to avoid that contradiction. \n Teaching only theories that are 'neutral' is a grievous sacrifice of truth to faith.\n \n 55.46 - Or I could listen to what the theory is and ignore the meaningless opinions on both sides.\n \n As for Behe's statements that's his religious beliefs coming through, given the premise that God exists it seems silly to credit any other designer.\n \n That premise however is part of a circular logic trap that is common to all religion.\n \n I know for a fact that he did not attempt to prove that God exists in the edge of evolution or Darwin's black box.\n \n As I said I reject the concept behind the word supernatural, it is a play on words that is in contradiction with an axiom of knowledge.\n \n supernatural - of, pertaining to, or being above or beyond what is natural; unexplainable by natural law or phenomena; abnormal.\n \n The only standard for natural law is that which really exists, meaning super natural can only refer to a state of faith powered pseudo-existance beyond our understanding.\n \n This word doesn't belong in our dictionaries much less science.\n \n 56-<59 - I would change the wording too if a term was deemed to have a certain meaning beyond it's dictionary definition due to a court case.\n \n 104.41 - He appears to believe that he has already contaminated the word ID and is now trying to tie ID to to the schooling as a condemnation?\n \n 112:33 - This is excellent point as to why religion exists. It is not evolution that removes this supernatural demand but religion that instills it.\n \n 117.48 - This concept is dangerous to the left that is true, he is offended by the idea as many are because they believe it's impossible.\n \n Ethics is a branch of philosophy but philosophy should be treated as a branch of scientific investigation.\n \n Good and Evil are perhaps the most important terms any scientific thesis will ever contain.\n \n Again this is what religion owes for it's influence and longevity.\n \n Not going to see the rest of the questions right now.",

   "No, Darwin predicted gradualism, and he was wrong about that.\n\n You are right, neither modern evolution or Darwinian evolution predicted gradualism both rely on it.\n \n I sometimes confuse predict with rely, the line is somewhat blurred when it comes to theories but that is not excuse.\n \n To elaborate modern evolution does not predict beneficial mutations always exist for those species which was supposed to have advanced, but it's prediction that they advanced relies on that premise.\n \n PE illustrates a point that was predicted through the IC analysis, organisms reach points in which there are no significant small beneficial mutations.\n \n This is direct evidence that the tree which peeling postulated does not exist.\n \nDarwin also thought inherited traits were a blend of the parents' traits and he was wrong about that too.\n\n Sometimes they are.\n \n \nWith the advent of genetics and the discovery of the role of gene regulatory mechanisms in the genome, Darwin's gradualism has been tossed out. Consequently, 'evolution' does not predict gradualism - small changes in regulatory sequences can produce large morphological changes.\n\n That's true and that's the reason anatomy has very few examples of IC. (not that a molecular machines can't have large changes via small mutation it just doesn't help in the way simple scale and dimension of organs can effect an organism).\n \n That does not however throw out gradualism it simply indicates that large morphological changes could happen more quickly (than what?) Darwin had no timescale to envision except what he saw around him and in the fossil record.\n \n The important part about PE is the state of equilibrium that is detrimental to the premise that the fittest individual may always have advancement.\n \n Don't get too excited by thinking I am claiming more here than I have said. You are probably going to get around to saying \"when the equilibrium was punctuated then the selective pressures were altered which allowed new evolutionary pathways to be opened'\n \n Yes I know that's what the theory implies, and I know any given equilibrium is not proof that it is a permanent plateau.\n \n I apologize, after re-reading my post I realize I went off subject.\n \n To be clear all I maintain is the analogy to junk DNA in creationism, and the point that PE is counter-intuitive to evolution which 'reeks' of gradualism, I have the statements of several evolutionist to give support to the latter of this position.\n \n Databed has repeated to me many times 'you are forgetting how long this has been going on' (paraphrasing), that wouldn't matter if the scientific consensus is that biology spends less than 10% of it actually moving along a pathway.\n \n Many evolutionist first response to IC is to cite gradualism as an attempt to counter the 'sudden change' feel of IC *which happens to be the suspicious 'feel' for many including evolutionist.\n \n I found the very word gradualism on one of those huge websites dedicated to defeating creationist arguments, in which one of whom were supposed to be only scientist in a relevant field; stated 'if something happened suddenly that would be evidence of creation, but it doesn't it happens gradually'(paraphrasing).\n \n Oh and Richard Dawkins supports gradualism. The Blind Watchmaker, p. 240..\n \n From a honest evolutionist point of view it's just one of those odd things, but from a creationist point of view it's cover for the fact that the PE modification ToE exempts it from producing 'transitional fossils' for any given species because paleontologist will tell you (pretty sure) that getting a fossil from a period only tens of thousands of years long is like well, trying to catch a photo by randomly opening the shutter when the light only turns on for 1 second every hour.\n \n I am not saying that is what it means to me, it illuminates the 'gene-scape' that my argument against co-option relies on.\n \n \n\n Modern evolution predicts punctuated equilibrium as well. It goes like this. Less change is expected during times of environmental stability and/or when a genome is very well suited for whatever niche it is occupying. You can accept this, right?\n \n More change would be expect during during times of environmental instability and/or when a genome starts to occupy a new niche. \n \n The environmental part is obvious and isn't even necessary, but it by itself can account for sudden genetic changes. To take this further, a new niche can be either founded or taken over by a sudden genetic change that happens to allow for it. Once the new niche is occupied, this is equivalent to a sudden change in environment and again, it follows that sudden increase in genetic changes will occur.\n \n The part you will likely deny, is the part where a sudden genetic change allows for occupation of a new niche, or possibly, novel function (not necessarily, but I will consider this is true for the sake of your stance). \n \n I want to say more about this, but I'm at work. Later.\n\n I don't deny that sudden genetic change can happen, I don't deny changes in the environment can open up new niches. What I hope you realize (it seems you do from your post) is that an environmental change cannot cause a corresponding change in mutation rates, therefore if it sparks a genetic change that means the species was in genetic equilibrium (yea duh), the important part about that state though is that it is a genetic dead end or 'valley' in the terms of landscape that peeling and I were using.\n \n I postulated that the genetic landscape is extremely rough plateaus of function, most of which are insurmountable in a practical sense.\n \n This landscape contained mostly well like valleys (species gets to highest fitness and stops) as opposed to interconnected river valleys that peeling suggested.\n \n I used IC to justify the plateaus and the ratio of beneficial mutations to infer the well valleys.\n \n PE as a theory justifies the well valleys.\n \n \nemoticon_confused No, he is claiming that the Cambrian Explosion could be an example of Punctuated Equilibrium. \n The Cambrian Explosion being the first diversification of multicellular lifeforms prior to the first recorded mass extinction.\n Punctuated Equilibrium states that species will diversify to fill available ecological niches following a mass extinction then remain fairly stable untill the next mass extinction. \n As such \"his point\" is paradoxical non-sense.\n\n I was not aware PE was limited to a extinction event.",
