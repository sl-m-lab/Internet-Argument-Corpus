My decision was prompted by the fact that there are a number of pressing concerns which demand my immediate attention, some of which are professional while others are personal in nature. I work as a computer consultant and have been recently asked to oversee a rather massive project. As if that were not enough, I was recently diagnosed with diabetes along with an ongoing prostate problem. No biggie, I can cope. \n \n I wish to express my appreciation to this forum for allowing me to publish my views concerning the subject of religion, especially comparative religion. I consider the subject to be fascinating. I'll get back as soon as I can, assuming that my humble contributions are of any value.",
