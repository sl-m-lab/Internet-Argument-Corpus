Also in the US if a law suit is brought it is normaly not about getting treatment it's about pain a suffering compensation. In the US if you bring a law suit there is virtualy no risk of having to pay the defendants legal fees if they win so there is no risk to the person or law firm in bringing a suit. This is why frivilous law suits are rampent in the US. Most insurance companies will settle a suit than take it to trial since it costs less to settle.",
