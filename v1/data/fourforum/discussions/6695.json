   "I am trying to understand why the fetus in the womb is totally innocent, totally blameless. But as soon as a child is born it is sinful. Is there something tainting about passing through the vagina of a woman to be born that makes a child so sinful?\n\n Maybe because the baby sees the vagina which is a form of seeing pornogrophy and their for the baby is naughty. :p Actually, I thought that the child was considered innocent until about the age of 5 or so.\n \nAlso, why aren't we supposed to see the flag-drapped coffins of soldiers' bodies being returned from Iraq.

Why is it so bad now for us to know when it was not so in previous wars?\n\n If the American people were to see all the flag drapped coffins from the War in Iraq, they might actually see that War is Hell! They may also realize that Bush was an idiot all along (Like the 49% of us that voted against him) and that he is more interested in tearing families apart when he says that he is such \"family man\" and all for \"family values.\" LIAR! If people could see what a stupid messed up mistake it was in going to war with Iraq in the first place, Bush's approvial rating would fall tremendiously. Far beyond the 39% level where I hear it is at now. In going to war with Iraq, Bush has just pulled family members apart. Where are his \"family values\" when it comes to the soldures loosing their lives? Huh? HUH?!? Probibly one of the stupidest things I have heard of was when that one lady who lost her son in the war went to protest in Crawford and later went to lead the \"Bring Them Home Now Tour\" got arrested for protesting without a licence! emoticon_wow Well tell me where I can sign up for a licence to protest. I've been protesting the war with Iraq since before March '03. There are even soldures who faught in Iraq who say that we should have never gone over there in the first place.\n Have I dug my point into the ground yet? If not, I could continue. Mainly, I think that the soldures who have died are not getting the respect that they deserve. I'll leave it that so this doesn't get too long.\n \nI think that these are both political questions and religious questions so I have also started a thread under religion.\n\n I think the they could actually have been seperated. The baby one under religion (politics don't decide who sins when) and the flag drapped coffins under politics because there are no religious matters to it. It's all politcal.",
