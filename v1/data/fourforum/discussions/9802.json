   "I've got a question about the whole \"summer driving season\". \n Why is it that people in the US drive more in the summer? I mean, it would stand to reason that since the weather is better in the summer, people would drive less because they can just walk or ride a bicycle as opposed to the winter where peoples butts freeze off and walking or riding a bicycle is not a option.\n I myself drive less in the summer for that very reason and I know that most people in Holland act the same way.\n So why is it so different in the US?\n \n Oh and BTW, gasoline is close to $7,50 per gallon over here now. :p\n\n \n Summer is when the ids are out of school so fols load them up to head off to see the worlds biggest ball of twine or see aunt sally in paduka. \n \n Also, it is HOT in the summer in much of the US. Screw that walking and sweating thing. We prefer air conditioned comfort.",

We load the race car on the trailer and drive to races that are often hundreds of miles from my home. I also drive from Michigan to other states to visit relatives, sit on the beach, fly rockets and other seasonal activities. \n Pulling a 7000# car and trailer on foot isn't an option. :)",

If I used the 'real' inflation numbers then gasoline would have to hit $10,- or more to break the record.",
