   "I saw just saw Outsourced in the theaters. It's made me think and talk about outsourcing all week and I thought it was charming enough (plus I like supporting Seattle indie films, especially ones that become popular) that I'm working on a review to send around as a sample, I'll post a copy here when I finish it. I looked closely at the website and realized it's more realistic that people will see it on DVD, since it's being released Nov. 1 and already gone from the theaters here. Here's the trailer.",
