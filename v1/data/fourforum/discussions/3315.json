   "I'm interested in the views of Christian readers on the following issues...In discussions of wives 'submitting' to husbands--\"graciously\" submitting, as Southern Baptists additionally demand--sooner or later talk must get down to the 'brass tacks' of particular cases. Each of the following is a case in which one or more persons in a church I've attended holds that a woman ought to submit or a man ought to hold control. I'd be grateful for any readers' reactions to these respective cases, starring hypthetical couple John & Marsha... \n \n CASE #1. JOHN doesn't approve of the book MARSHA is reading. He takes it. Explains to MARSHA, \"For your own good, I've taken this. It's not something I believe you should be reading.\" Is MARSHA obliged to submit? \n \n CASE #2. In MARSHA's college English class, they're seeing a film tonight. She told JOHN the title. JOHN consulted his book of Christian film reviews, and sees a serious 'bad language' warning. He forbids MARSHA to go. Is MARSHA obliged to submit? \n \n CASE #3. JOHN's a staunch Republican. MARSHA's family leans Democrat and, recently, Nader and Green. This is the first federal election of their married life. JOHN strongly believes that no \"real Christian\" would vote other than Republican. He tells MARSHA that he wants her to vote Republican. What's more, he asks that MARSHA promise him she'll vote Republican and verify, on exiting the poll, that she has. Is MARSHA obliged to vote as JOHN directs? Is MARSHA obliged to reveal her vote to JOHN? \n \n CASE #4. JOHN wants sex tonight. He's been away ten days on a business trip. MARSHA feels like ****, has the flu and an early day tomorrow. She doesn't want to, and says no. JOHN insists. Is MARSHA obliged to submit? \n \n CASE #5. In Sunday school, JOHN and MARSHA discover they disagree over certain scriptural passages often used to confine pastoral roles to men. JOHN insists ONLY men can be pastors. MARSHA reads those passages differently, and sees no problem at all with female pastors, and indeed wishes there were a few more. JOHN explains to MARSHA that HE is to be the arbiter of any interpretive disputes between them. JOHN instructs that HIS interpretation is correct, and that MARSHA henceforth is to adopt his interpretation, and to hold that woman cannot, after all, correctly serve as pastors. Is MARSHA obliged to submit?",

Each of the following is a case in which one or more persons in a church I've attended holds that a woman ought to submit or a man ought to hold control. I'd be grateful for any readers' reactions to these respective cases, starring hypthetical couple John & Marsha... \n \n\n I won't address your case-by-case scenarios but give you some generalised guide-lines...\n \n The idea of submission in this context is not of one party giving and the other taking at all, but of mutual obligations...\n Ephesians 5:22 Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savoir. 24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. \n 25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 26 to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, 27 and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29 After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- 30 for we are members of his body. 31\"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\"[3] 32 This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. 33 However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.\n A husband is to love his wife with as much effort as Christ loved us - even to the point of giving up His life for us. That's not a small thing to ask. Mutual obligations are repeated...\n 1 Corinthians 11:11\n In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 12 For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.\n \n \"Christian women also exercised far more choice in whom they wed...\"Carroll, V & Shiflett, D (2002), \"Christianity on Trial: Arguments against Anti-Religious Bigotry\", p4\n It's mutual obligation. \"In fact what distinguished Paul from his non-Christian contemporaries was not the patriarchal views he sometimes expressed...but rather his repeated emphasis on the obligations of husbands to wives.\" Ibid, p5\n \n Colossians 3:18 18 Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 19 Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them. 20 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.\n \n Does this mean children are slaves?\n \n 1 Peter 3:7\n Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.",

Let me say this: God did not say that. The head of the household is a hard job and not to be taken lightly. It&#8217;s not boss of the house, which in line with what jitobear said &#8211; the woman definitely is. When we take scripture out of context then we remove holiness and replace it with religion.

A woman must desire to be subject and likewise for the man (husband and wife) &#8211; they must be mutually focused on each other. If something hurts one it hurts the other.\n Submission does not mean inferiority, but equality. Try to put that on a religionist&#8217;s plate and see how much they&#8217;ll choke down.
