   "Imagine a tax system that Works:\n \n *allows you to keep 100% of your paycheck, pension, and Social Security payments.\n \n *frees up the time wasted on filling out cumbersome I.R.S. forms.\n \n *makes taxation of income unconstitutional by repealing the 16th Amendment.\n \n *exempts all taxpayers from federal taxation, up to the poverty level, through a monthly rebate.\n \n *ensures that all Americans pay their fair share of taxes.\n \n *dramatically lowers tax rates for low-income and middle-income Americans.\n \n *dramatically reduces the cost of goods and services by 20% to 30%.\n \n *allows families to save more for home ownership, education, and retirement. \n \n *protects and ensures the funding of Social Security and Medicare.\n \n *leaves unchanged the amount of money raised by the federal government.\n Makes American products more competitive overseas.\n \n How? This tax system is the most researched, and we think you'll agree, the best tax reform plan -- it's called the FairTax SM. See it at www.fairtax.org \n \n The Problem is the Current Income Tax Code.\n \n A. The current tax code is unfair, costly, and unreasonably confusing. Because the tax code is so complex and easy to evade, many of us pay more in taxes per year than we should! The I.R.S. estimates that over 40% of Americans no longer comply with the current tax code! This makes the rest of us pay over 30% more in taxes.\n Over half of American taxpayers seek professional help simply to prepare their returns. And according to Money Magazine, chances are 99% that you will pay someone to file an incorrect return!\n Compliance with the tax code is not only very difficult and complicated, but unreasonably expensive as well. It is estimated that it costs taxpayers $225 billion for tax filing, tax record keeping, and tax reduction advice. That's the equivalent of about $850 for every man, woman and child in America! We have taxation without comprehension!\n \n B. The current income tax code unfairly hampers personal financial opportunity.\n \n When citizens are taxed on their earnings and on what they produce, hard work is discouraged.\n The current income tax code inhibits economic growth, capital formation, and, most importantly, job creation.\n The current income tax code punishes personal savings and investments; and sometimes these are unfairly subjected to double and even triple taxation.\n \n C. The current income tax code tax is grossly unfair to all wage-earning Americans.\n \n Payroll taxes are taken out of our paychecks, and we all have no control or choice over when we pay or how much we pay in taxes. They are deducted from our paychecks before we can save or spend it.\n The payroll tax is the most regressive and unfair feature of our current tax system. The current payroll tax applies only to wages, and hurts the most important tool by which anyone who is not born to wealth has to get ahead.\n \n D. The current tax system allows for massive loopholes encouraging politicians and lobbyists to pick winners and losers.\n \n The tax code is filled with loopholes that are manipulated by high-priced lobbyists for their clients, and by other special interests.\n The complexity of the current income tax code is an open invitation to those with the means to manipulate the tax code.\n There are more lobbyists registered in Washington for taxes than for any other issue.\n \n The Solution is the FairTax:\n \n The FairTax is fair to all Americans and simple to understand. Under the FairTax, all wage earners will keep 100% of their paychecks, prices will drop dramatically, and Social Security and Medicare funding will be more secure.\n The FairTax frees up financial opportunity by restoring choice in spending, encouraging savings and investment, and dramatically reducing tax evasion. With the elimination of virtually all compliance costs, $225 billion will be restored to the economy. The FairTax offers an unprecedented opportunity for lower and middle-income wage earners to get ahead, to save to buy a house, to educate themselves and their children, and to save for a dignified retirement. And under the FairTax, all Americans, regardless of their income level, will be better off with the FairTax.\n \n Everyone will be subject to the same consumption tax rate with no exceptions and no exclusions, and those least able to share in the cost of government will carry no federal tax burden at all.\n The FairTax increases individual purchasing power, making it easier to get ahead financially by eliminating:\n \n the individual income tax, including capital gains taxes\n the payroll income tax\n the inheritance tax and the gift tax\n the self-employment tax\n the corporate income tax\n \n The solution we propose involves two actions:\n \n Passage of legislation that institutes a single-rate, FairTax on all final sales of new goods and services. This tax would become the chief source of revenue for the United States government, replacing all federal income and payroll taxes, yet generating the same revenue. The legislation provides for a tax rebate equal to the consumption tax paid on essential goods and services. The rebate ensures that no American will pay tax on the purchase of necessities.\n A constitutional amendment that would repeal the 16th Amendment and make a federal income tax unconstitutional.\n \n We Can Win!\n \n Bringing the FairTax to a vote only requires 31 members of Congress! If eleven members of the Senate Finance Committee and twenty members of the Ways and Means Committee support the FairTax, they can bring the FairTax Bill out of their respective committees and onto the floor of both the House and the Senate. At that point, it would be the leadership's decision to go to a full vote by the entire membership. It can be done, and we are well on our way there.\n Polling shows that the American people understand and favor fundamental reform such as a federal consumption tax. The national groundswell of support is growing in leaps and bounds. Thousands of Americans are expressing their support for the FairTax through phone calls, e-mails, letters, and faxes. FairTax Volunteers are growing by the hundreds. The possibility of bringing about peaceful change is one of the great strengths of the American system. It is obvious that the FairTax is a reasonable solution whose time has come.\n Let me repeat the tremendous benefits of the FairTax plan. The FairTax plan:\n \n Allows you to keep 100% of your paycheck, pension, and Social Security payments.\n Frees up the time wasted on filling out cumbersom I.R.S. forms.\n Makes taxation of income unconstitutional by repealing the 16th Amendment.\n Exempts all taxpayers from federal taxation, up to the poverty level, through a monthly rebate.\n Ensures that all Americans pay their fair share of taxes.\n Dramatically lowers tax rates for low-income and middle-income Americans.\n Dramatically reduces the cost of goods and services by 20% to 30%.\n Allows families to save more for home ownership, education, and retirement.\n Protects and ensures the funding of Social Security and Medicare.\n Leaves unchanged the amount of money raised by the federal government.\n Makes American products more competitive overseas.\n As Americans come to understand that the FairTax will close tax loopholes and make everyone pay their fair share of taxes, it will be passed into law. Fully 85% of Americans informed about the FairTax are likely to support the tax change that makes the closing of these loopholes a reality. And the FairTax offers not only this, but many other benefits:\n \n You never pay another hidden tax again. The FairTax is printed on every receipt for every purchase.\n All taxpayers are treated fairly. No loopholes for anyone.\n Individuals have more control and choice. People can make choices about how much to pay in taxes, by deciding when to buy and what to buy.\n Virtually all economic models project a much healthier economy under the FairTax. Real investment will grow by an estimated 76.4 percent. Exports will jump by an estimated 26.4 percent. Interest rates will drop between 20 and 30 percent.\n Small businesses never have to track tax withholdings or deductions.\n Tax evasion will dramatically decrease. No more income-reporting means the end of \"hiding\" income from tax authorities.\n Compliance costs will be slashed. Compliance costs will drop by over 90%, from $225 billion.\n \n Concluding Remarks:\n \n It is time for the FairTax. For nearly 100 years, we have carried the burden of an oppressive and counterproductive tax system which has punished work and achievement, savings, and investment. The current tax code has been grossly manipulated to reward elite political interests, and it hurts the average American. The current tax code has hidden the true cost of government from the very taxpayers who pay for it.\n Americans are not obligated to accept a tax system that penalizes the average working American while giving special consideration to those who buy favors and perks in Washington, D.C. To be competitive in the next century, and to renew the American dream, we must change the way we fund our national government. It is time for the FairTax.\n The FairTax will allow Americans to keep 100% of their paychecks, dramatically reduce prices, protect and ensure funding of Social Security and Medicare, empower low-income taxpayers, and put choice and control back into the hands of all Americans. All the crucial elements are in place: a public, eager and ready for a tax system that is fair, and a Congress seriously willing to consider genuine tax reform. It only takes thirty-one Congressmen, and we will win.",

   "You sound real down on the wealthy using their money.\n Quite the contrary. The wealthy should be able to spend their money any way they want (ALL of it). But not just the wealthy - EVERYONE should be able to spend their money any way they want (ALL of it). Under the FairTax EVERYTHING applies to EVERYONE equally. YOU (Mr. Rich or Mr. Poor) determine how much tax you pay by how you spend your money.\n \n \nEquality has historically been an idealistic goal as wealth normally controls most governing ideology.\n Since equality is a major part of our constitution, the least we can try and do, is PROMOTE it with our laws.\n \n \nOne attractive feature of democracy is the illusion that anyone can reach a position of wealth and control, which serves as initial worker motivation.\nThis hasn't always been an ILLUSION, and it doesn't have to be any more. Only since taxes on Income became legal, have people been penalized for their hard work. By taxing their INCOME, people have no choice. Their money is taken FIRST, before they get it. All that \"initial worker motivation\" to become wealthy, goes right out the window when you wonder where all your money has gone, that you worked so hard for. \n \n The Fair Tax allows EVERYONE (low incomers up to the top earners) to make their own choices with ALL of their money. \n \n EVERYONE is treated EQUALLY  under the FairTax - no favorites (the rich aren't favored, the middle class aren't favored, the poor aren't favored).\n EVERYONE pays the same TAX RATE regardless of income (rich or poor). \n EVERYONE with the same size family, has the same size Prebate refund available to them (or it can be declined).

   "There are a large number of problems that I see with the proposed plan. Perhaps I'm interpreting this incorrectly, so maybe someone can help me out. Here goes:\n \n \n \n*allows you to keep 100% of your paycheck, pension, and Social Security payments.\n\n \n Is this really a benefit if the tax is just being moved somewhere else?\n \n \n*ensures that all Americans pay their fair share of taxes.\n\n \n Well a fair share of taxes is really a matter of opinion, for one might argue that it is not fair for two people in our society do equal amounts of work requiring equal amounts of skill but to be paid differently. Yet this does happen, for we live in a capitalistic society. Because one man has used Capitalism, which is the government's chosen system of choice, in order to get himself more money than the next person, is it not fair for the government to charge the man who fell victim to capitalism a lower percentage than the man who used it to reap benefits for himself?\n \n \n*frees up the time wasted on filling out cumbersome I.R.S. forms.\n\n \n A different taxation fix could certainly do the same thing.\n \n \n*dramatically lowers tax rates for low-income and middle-income Americans.\n \n *leaves unchanged the amount of money raised by the federal government.\n Makes American products more competitive overseas.\n \n\n \n I truly don't see how this is possible. I would expect this plan to dramatically increase the tax rates for low-income and middle-income Americans. The proposed flat tax on all goods and services (except food, etc) should be effectively the equivalent of taxing everyone at a flat rate (except instead of getting less money in your check, everything will just cost more). Because of this, it certainly seems likely that the wealthy will be paying far less taxes. Since we would have the same amount of money in the system, in order for the government to continue making as much money as it does, the tax rate would need to be high enough that the lower and middle class Americans pay an immensely higher percentage of taxes than they currently do. It seems mathematically impossible for any other conclusion to be reached.\n \n \n*dramatically reduces the cost of goods and services by 20% to 30%.\n\n \n I don't think that this will happen. What would initially happen is businesses would find themselves with far more money. This would mean that they either pay their employees more money and produce the same number of goods and services (which would increase the price of goods, except that the incredible tax rates have already caused the price of goods to increase) or the companies would expand to fill the unemployment rate, produce more goods, which floods the market and temporarily lowers costs until businesses begin to make less money (because lower and middle-class citizens can't afford as many goods and services due to a higher taxation percentage), which leads them to raise prices back up, or cut jobs (which in turn cuts off the supply of goods and thus raises prices).\n \n \n*allows families to save more for home ownership, education, and retirement.\n\n \n Certainly it would allow families to save more, but because of increased sales taxes on goods and services, that money would be far less valuable to them.\n \n \n*protects and ensures the funding of Social Security and Medicare.\n\n \n I really don't see how this would happen. Even if social security benefits and medical costs remained the same (even though social security money would not go as far due to increased taxes), the government would only be taking in the same amount of money to pay for these things, according to the above.\n \n \nA. The current tax code is unfair, costly, and unreasonably confusing. Because the tax code is so complex and easy to evade, many of us pay more in taxes per year than we should! The I.R.S. estimates that over 40% of Americans no longer comply with the current tax code! This makes the rest of us pay over 30% more in taxes.\n\n \n This means that anyone has a 2/5 chance (if you were part of that 40%) of being supposed to pay an additional 45% in taxes? That sounds pretty fishy to me, but even if it is true, then your fix for this issue should only benefit 60% of the population, while hurting 40%.\n \n \nOver half of American taxpayers seek professional help simply to prepare their returns. And according to Money Magazine, chances are 99% that you will pay someone to file an incorrect return!\n Compliance with the tax code is not only very difficult and complicated, but unreasonably expensive as well. It is estimated that it costs taxpayers $225 billion for tax filing, tax record keeping, and tax reduction advice. That's the equivalent of about $850 for every man, woman and child in America! We have taxation without comprehension!\n\n \n Again, a simplification of the current tax process seems like a far better fix for this problem; the solution proposed by fairtax seems full of problems.\n \n \nB. The current income tax code unfairly hampers personal financial opportunity.\n \n When citizens are taxed on their earnings and on what they produce, hard work is discouraged.\n The current income tax code inhibits economic growth, capital formation, and, most importantly, job creation.\n\n \n This implies that we would be more economically successful if the wealthy were taxed less because that would create new jobs. It's the trickle-down theory of economics, and although such a theory holds a place in economics, it is not going to help the economy in the way many think it will.\n \n The trickle-down economics idea bases itself on the principle of supply, assuming that there will always be enough demand for products. People will always want more. By cutting taxes on the upper class and businesses, we can create new jobs, which will give more money to the lower-class unemployed, and it will flood the market with more goods, lowering the cost for everyone. It will lower costs and defeat unemployment with the same blow. Yet this idea is not without its problems, for taken to its extreme, we can see that demand does indeed die out. The problem is that a flat tax rate, as suggested, actually takes money away from the lower class in comparison. This means that the amount of money they have to spend is less, and thus the money they spend to fund businesses is less, and the demand for goods drops. Furthermore, at some point unemployment bottoms out; usually and there aren't more employees to be added to the workforce. At this point, businesses aren't able to use their additional money to expand and produce more, so we end up with just a lower class of citizens that has less money without an increased flood of goods into the marketplace to drop prices in compensation. The demand has faltered, and the supply is no longer increasing.\n \n Cutting taxes on the wealthy seems as though it can be useful in times of excessive unemployment, but in times of a healthy unemployment rate, I would argue that cutting taxes on the wealthy is not a good idea.\n \n Am I wrong about the effects that this fairtax would have? Can someone help me out?",

As I think you said yourself (in a previous post) \"fairness\" is a matter of opinion.\n\n \n Hmm, well yes I see that you were referring to lowering taxes, but the discussion had been around the effects of fairtax and whether it is best to tax the wealthy more or not. I just meant that I'm not sure how this relates.\n \n \nFinding the point at which a tax increase proves to be a disincentive or a tax decrease reduces revenues below the optimum, is an empirical deliberation - and it thus should be possible to measure these effects objectively.\n\n \n Well although we can measure the amount of tax money we brought in during a given year; that number generally increases even with no change in taxes (due to inflation). So the problem with measuring it is that it would really be difficult to say, \"With a higher tax, we wouldn't have made much more money.\" In truth, no one knows how much money the government is going to bring in each year. I mean, we might notice huge differences in revenue if they happened, but usually that isn't the case. If you look at the Laffer curve, as you get closer to the peak, changes in taxation have less effect on revenue.",

Businesses will always pay their employees the lowest possible rate, and because people have difficult times finding new jobs, can't work at just any job they aren't qualified for, and can't afford to be unemployed for any significant period of time, the ability of employees to simply move to different jobs is extremely limited. Not only that, but people naturally find change difficult. Also, companies encourage people to remain at their own company instead of switching jobs through raises and promotion.

Does \"fair\" mean that all employees are being paid the value of their work, or can payment be fair even though people at the top make far more money than their own work produces while the middle class make far less money than their work produces? Or is fair defined simply as whatever payment the free market creates?\n \n \nRight now, there are more government workers than those employed in manufacturing.

First of all, the Federal budget is not 1 Trillion, it is almost 2.5 Trillion. In your system, individuals would not be responsible for paying only $5,000 per year, they'd have to pay something like $15,000 per year. This means that the government had better be handing out $30 per hour paychecks, which is currently far higher than it hands out for most government jobs (plus now it can't collect tax money back on those payments), which means that the Federal budget would increase dramatically, making the number far higher than $15,000 per person. If it instead paid people at $10 per hour as you suggest, then people will need to work closer to 30 hours per week for the government, making no money. This leaves precious little time for other employment.\n \n And what about education? With people working so much, they aren't going to have time to retrain themselves for new jobs, which means that if their industry fails, they'll have an incredibly difficult time retraining themselves. This is coupled with the fact that everyone will need additional education to deal with their government positions, especially since people will often be opting in and out of government work each year depending on whether they can afford the $15,000 tax payment. This will dramatically increase training costs for government employees as well as decreasing long-term knowledge of a position resulting in an overall drop in efficiency of government.\n \n Anyhow, it should seem apparent that with either a $15,000 per year tax or thirty hours of work per week, the standard of living for the middle and lower class would drop dramatically.\n \n \nHuh? What sort of nonsense are you saying? A job's value is determined by the wage in which it pays. If it doesn't pay \"enough\" in a free market, then it goes unfilled. The fact that it's filled says that someone believes that it's a fair wage.\n\n \n A job's value is determined by how much it pays, in a sense, but not by how much the employer pays the employee. For example, a corporation might hire a group of people to create and sell a software product. That group of people puts 50 hours per week of work into that product and releases it. But even though they put the effort into the creation and sale of the product, little of the revenue created by the product goes to them; it goes to higher members of the corporation and the corporation itself, even though these did not put in as much effort toward creating the software. People are payed less than the value of their work.\n \n \nSo, in the beginning of the paragraph, you state that the employer pays the lowest possible rate but at the end of the paragraph you say that promotions and raises distort the free market by making the employee NOT want to leave. WOW! emoticon_wow What the hell are you saying? The free market isn't maintained because good workers are compensated at a higher rate than they were initially paid? Doesn't that indicate that their value to the employer went up and therefore to keep them, so did their wages? That's exactly what a free market does. It rewards performance.\n\n \n I am saying that the free market isn't maintained in part because long-term workers are paid more money. I certainly agree that employers paying long-term employees more money indicates that they are more valuable and that the employer wants to keep them. But I would not necessarily agree that this increased wage constitutes a fair wage. Allow me to explain:\n \n In an ideal free system, any employee or potential employee would be able to choose the job that offers the best benefits and compensation for the work done. In reality, this is not the case; lots of obstacles exist which prevent employees from moving from job to job, and lots of incentives exist to encourage employees not to move from job to job. Because of this, employees end up getting paid far less than the value their work produces. Employees aren't as able to move to a better employer if their own employer charges them too little. The job market really isn't a free market.\n \n \nMonopolies aren't necessarily bad things. Utility companies have monopolies and until fairly recently, so did the phone company. These were granted to promote growth in the electric and telephone grid. If there were no monopolies, would electric companies compete to run 5 miles of cable to a single house in the middle of nowhere? Of course not. By giving a company a monopoly WITH STRINGS, companies were able to undertake non-profitable tasks as long as they made a profit overall. Without the monopoly, that house would still be in the dark. (I know, lots of money came from the REA)\n\n \n Well, you're probably right that monopolies aren't necessarily bad, however would you argue that no monopolies are bad? I can see why you wouldn't want them broken up sometimes, and our laws should be smart enough to understand when and when not to break them up.\n \n \nThe biggest problem with public education is that it IS a monopoly....but that's a topic for another thread.\n\n \n I agree, but if we fixed it with a system such as school vouchers, we'd introduce a far bigger problem.\n \n \nCapitalism has a much greater chance of success than communism because of the very nature of the rewards vs risks.\n\n \n You're right; although both capitalism and communism have problems, the problems of capitalism are more easily fixed than the problems of communism.

   "Re: Laffer curve\n \n The theory of the Laffer curve itself do not require increased productivity. It assumes that even without increasing productivity, at certain tax rate levels, a reduction in the tax rate would result in an increase in tax revenues. However, without an increase in productivity, the laffer curve effect has not been observed. This simply implies that the laffer curve is incorrect (in the short-run). An increase in productivy, assuming everything else equal, will always result in higher tax revenue.\n \n Re: capitalism and government\n \n It should be obvious that most governments create the enviroment where capitalism can work. One could say that it \"implements\" capitalism. Without property rights, capitalism would fail. Without a vigerous government, property rights do not exist (or would not be protected for those who, for some mysterious reason, believe that property right is somehow natural or divine).\n \n re: \"fair wage\"\n \n Who is to say that a wage is \"fair\" just because someone accepts it?

Is the freedom to choose between two (or more) options?\n \n re: setting wages\n \n There are numerous ways the wage-setting process is distorted. One cannot simply view the wage as any other commodity. Even as a production factor, it is unique. Even though supply and demand are important when assigning wages in a market economy, there are other important aspects as well (minimum wage laws just being one of them).\n \n re: monopolies\n \n Monopolies, on firms with high levels of monopoly powers are in most cases inefficient due to their ability to influence prices. Under certain conditions, pure monopolies can be more efficient or desireable than perfect competition. Production of goods or services with external benefits (such as education, or RnD), production of goods or services with external costs (such as enviromentally dangerous products or addictive drugs and activities), wages (as they are also political), production of goods and services that are potentially dangerous to public safety (like nuclear power, military, police) etc, etc. But quite often, regulations and/or governmental financiation is more efficient than monopolies due to the nature of competition.\n \n re: capitalism vs communism\n \n I think it`s apparant that communism as a mode of production has failed to show any redeeming qualities. However, state intervention/ownership and mixed systems with socialism and capitalism has shown to be create dynamic and efficient economies.",

   "But this argument assumes that a free market creates a fair pay rate, and whether that is true depends on your definition of \"fair\". Does \"fair\" mean that all employees are being paid the value of their work, or can payment be fair even though people at the top make far more money than their own work produces while the middle class make far less money than their work produces? Or is fair defined simply as whatever payment the free market creates?\n\n Fair is whatever wage an employer and employee agree upon. Nothing more, nothing less. It isn't for outsiders to decide the value of somebody else's job.\n \n\n Ack, I do not agree with this plan. First of all, the Federal budget is not 1 Trillion, it is almost 2.5 Trillion. In your system, individuals would not be responsible for paying only $5,000 per year, they'd have to pay something like $15,000 per year. \n\n I said \"we set the budget at $1Trillion, not let's make it $2.5Trillion.\n \n\n This means that the government had better be handing out $30 per hour paychecks, which is currently far higher than it hands out for most government jobs (plus now it can't collect tax money back on those payments), which means that the Federal budget would increase dramatically, making the number far higher than $15,000 per person. If it instead paid people at $10 per hour as you suggest, then people will need to work closer to 30 hours per week for the government, making no money. This leaves precious little time for other employment.\n\n You totally misread my proposal. I'm not going to pay them a dime. They're going to work off their tax burden with \"in kind\" labor. For every $100 that they don't pay, thet's 10 hours of Federal service.\n \n\n And what about education? With people working so much, they aren't going to have time to retrain themselves for new jobs, which means that if their industry fails, they'll have an incredibly difficult time retraining themselves. This is coupled with the fact that everyone will need additional education to deal with their government positions, especially since people will often be opting in and out of government work each year depending on whether they can afford the $15,000 tax payment. This will dramatically increase training costs for government employees as well as decreasing long-term knowledge of a position resulting in an overall drop in efficiency of government.\n\n First, government efficiency is an oxymoron. ;) Second, there are hundreds of thousands of jobs that unskilled laborers can do easily. And, remember, I also said that they could work for a company that would pay their \"fair share\" of the tax burden for them in return for their part-time labor of 500hours/year. \n And if you think that we don't easily waste 500 hours/year doing nothing productive, then I'd say that you are a rarity. \n \n\n Anyhow, it should seem apparent that with either a $15,000 per year tax or thirty hours of work per week, the standard of living for the middle and lower class would drop dramatically.\n\n I disagree totally. For the lower wage earners, the extra time spent working may give them skills to find a \"real\" job that pays better in the private sector.\n For those in the middle, $5000 represents a tax cut and they'd have more money to spend.\n \n\n A job's value is determined by how much it pays, in a sense, but not by how much the employer pays the employee. For example, a corporation might hire a group of people to create and sell a software product. That group of people puts 50 hours per week of work into that product and releases it. But even though they put the effort into the creation and sale of the product, little of the revenue created by the product goes to them; it goes to higher members of the corporation and the corporation itself, even though these did not put in as much effort toward creating the software. People are payed less than the value of their work.\n\n Not true. They worked for agreed upon wages. If they didn't think the wages were fair, they wouldn't take the job. And it was the software company and its management that took the financial risk in hiring the 50 people, targeting a market, in the hope that they would come up with a salable product. You want to pay winnings to somebody who never placed a bet on the horse race. That's fine if there's an agreed upon profit-sharing plan but not acceptable after the fact. If they don't want to work for someone else, they're free to start their own company and take the risks themselves.\n \n\n I am saying that the free market isn't maintained in part because long-term workers are paid more money. I certainly agree that employers paying long-term employees more money indicates that they are more valuable and that the employer wants to keep them. But I would not necessarily agree that this increased wage constitutes a fair wage. Allow me to explain:\n \n In an ideal free system, any employee or potential employee would be able to choose the job that offers the best benefits and compensation for the work done. In reality, this is not the case; lots of obstacles exist which prevent employees from moving from job to job, and lots of incentives exist to encourage employees not to move from job to job. Because of this, employees end up getting paid far less than the value their work produces. Employees aren't as able to move to a better employer if their own employer charges them too little. The job market really isn't a free market.\n\n That makes absolutely no sense. It's so nonsensical that I can't even follow it. What prevents you from changing jobs? What is that about charging employees too little? emoticon_confused \n \n\n Well, you're probably right that monopolies aren't necessarily bad, however would you argue that no monopolies are bad? I can see why you wouldn't want them broken up sometimes, and our laws should be smart enough to understand when and when not to break them up.\n\n On that we agree. Not all monopolies are good or bad.\n \n\n I agree, but if we fixed it with a system such as school vouchers, we'd introduce a far bigger problem.\n\n Yeah, teacher union members would actually be held accountable for their own performance. Heaven forbid. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n You're right; although both capitalism and communism have problems, the problems of capitalism are more easily fixed than the problems of communism. But we should support our government when it fixes those problems.\n\n Agreed.",

Your system does not indicate that the government would need to spend less money; probably more for constant training and increased ineffciency, so this 1.5 Trillion dollar tax cut isn't any more likely in your society than in our current one.

The problem as I see it is you, in your benevolence, want to pay workers more than the job is worth, which is admirable, but not necessary. :)\n\n \n Well, the problem is that there is rarely a labor shortage. Everyone needs a job, and they are basically forced to let companies tell them what their work is worth. How many employees could go to their boss and say, \"You know what, pay me more or I'm quitting.\" I'd guess 99% would be fired and replaced. Then that person wouldn't be likely to find a different job that paid more, but likely a different job that paid less. A problem is that unemployed people will take whatever they can get, and there are always unemployed people, especially people who have just entered the field.

But whether it is or not, we should still keep our graduated tax system.\n \n \nFirst, your math is faulty. Half is $500Billion, not $500Million.\n\n \n Umm, I knew that. I did!

Do that with a few million people and you're talking real money.\n\n \n Well, I'm not quite certain I follow... You're saying that currently government employees get benefits, so we'd actually be saving more money than we realize? Well, I see what you're saying, but I have a hard time believing that benefits are worth twice as much as the salary of the employee. Beyond that, this means that employees would be working for pennies. $10 an hour with no benefits? Might as well just pick up a second job at the local McDonald's. \n \n And I would say that is basically what you are arguing for here: a system in which the middle and lower class is taxed far more than they would be in our current graudated tax system, and if they can't afford it, they just have to get a second job.\n \n \nMany countries have mandatory military service for their citizens.

The people don't exist to serve the government, the government exists to serve the people. You don't owe something because you live in the US, we contribute to the US because we need it to protect us. It is the government which has instituted this system of capitalism, and the reason for this is not because some people deserve to live better than others. The reason for capitalism is that it creates the best life for everyone. But in as much as we can fix the problems of capitalism, like the fact that it does indeed elevate some people over others in its nature, we should do so. We don't promote capitalism for the sake of promoting capitalism, we promote it for the sake of the people.\n \n \nIn essence, we would be eliminating a huge deficit through the use of human capital. The money that would be freed up by those paying outrageous taxes now wouldn't be sitting in pillow cases.

If they have any \"real\" ability outside of paper pushing, I'm sure the business world will absorb them.\n\n \n Well, you're talking about tax cuts here; the flat tax system you are proposing isn't any more capable of making those cuts than our graduated one. If we could cut those taxes, yes, it would be nice. It wouldn't be a horrible thing to lose too many government jobs because they likely would be replaced, but it may indeed be a horrible thing to lose the services provided by those government jobs. Government jobs do not produce nothing, after all, even though they may be less efficient.\n \n \nMoney talks. The road to Hell is lined with good, unfunded ideas.\n\n \n That's only capitalist Hell. In capitalism, most people cannot afford to fund their good ideas.\n \n \nTo continue the analogy, I'd pay the rider a \"fair\" salary based on his ability.

If an employee fails to create a good product, he'll likely be fired; if the horse racer loses all his races, he won't long be a horse racer.\n \n Regardless, I don't think that having a direct financial stake in the outcome indicates what is fair at all. After all, it is captialism which created the situation in which only the upper class are able to afford that risk. Capitalism is a system in which a person with a lot of money tries to pay people less than the value of their work in hopes of making a profit. Well, that's not exactly true, for it would still be capitalism if they all split the profit evenly, but that isn't realistically what happens.\n \n \nWhich is a good reason why those who do risk it all should be highly rewarded. If I mortgage my house to start a business, it had better be worth the risk in the long run. That's how capitalism works. The higher the risk, the greater the reward.\n\n \n I don't think that's true; it may be true that the more money you could lose, the greater the reward. But for some people, gambling an amount of money might mean that they can't buy that third house. For another, gambling that same amount of money might mean that his family starves to death in the streets. It's the same reward, but a greater risk depending on one's social status.\n \n \nYou've just described the factors that influence your salary: easily replaced, limited number of companies hiring, limited qualification for the job, large pool of candidates.\n My story is the opposite. I have a highly specialized job that can't be easily learned, so my company keeps me happy.\n\n \n Well, I guess technically I can't be replaced easily, but there is certainly a limited number of companies hiring, and if this company loses me, they'll manage with one less person. They'll make less profit until they find someone new, but they won't crumble, and they'll eventually find someone. And I would argue that most positions are very easy to replace. I didn't mean that I have a limited qualification for this job, but that I can't search for jobs in other fields. If one field gets flooded with people looking for jobs, they can't just move to a new in-demand field. They need to be retrained.\n \n You may be among the few who chose an in-demand field, but my field was also incredibly in-demand until I was in my last year of college. It's just not easy for an employee to change.\n \n \nI'd like to see the \"commonness\" disappear because the \"commonness\" is poor overall performance in public schools. (Although you and I both live in unusually good Blue Ribbon school districts)\n\n \n Well, the problem is that I don't think schools will be much more common than colleges in a voucher system. Students would need to drive long distances every day or live on their own in order to get to school, and kids that age just aren't able to do that. A lesser but preventable problem is that if we take vouchers to their extreme, we'd allow religion and religious values in school, so for example, all the schools in your area could refuse you just based on your sexual orientation.

   "Since these posts have grown enormously, I'll chop up your reply into smaller bites and respond.\n \n \nWell, the problem is that there is rarely a labor shortage. Everyone needs a job, and they are basically forced to let companies tell them what their work is worth. How many employees could go to their boss and say, \"You know what, pay me more or I'm quitting.\" I'd guess 99% would be fired and replaced. Then that person wouldn't be likely to find a different job that paid more, but likely a different job that paid less. A problem is that unemployed people will take whatever they can get, and there are always unemployed people, especially people who have just entered the field. So if a person quits or is fired, he can be easily replaced; there are always more workers. Unless mass numbers of employees held out in searching for employment, such as in a union, there really isn't a demand for employees.\n\n The very fact that there's rarely a shortage of cheap, unskilled labor tells you that the value of such labor isn't high. If I grow corn and sell it at market for $1 an ear and I'm the only one growing corn, I might get awat with it. But if 50 people are growing corn and trying to sell it to one market, he has negotiating power. The same occurs with labor, except that the minimum wage laws artificially inflate the value of the most unskilled jobs.\n \n\n Well, I can't claim to be an expert on the debate over Social Security and Medicare, and it might be a good idea to cut those from the budget. But whether it is or not, we should still keep our graduated tax system.\n\n If SS and Medicare are taken off the budget, we'll never really know how debt-ridden we're really becoming. As for the \"good\" derived from the graduated income tax, you're perspective depends on whether or not you're a \"have\" or \"have-not\". The \"Have-nots\" love it because they don't pay squat. The \"haves\" hate it because they foot almost the entire bill.\n \n\n Umm, I knew that. I did! My keyboard probably put an \"M\" there even though I typed a \"B\".\n\n No problem.\n \n\n Well, I'm not quite certain I follow... You're saying that currently government employees get benefits, so we'd actually be saving more money than we realize? Well, I see what you're saying, but I have a hard time believing that benefits are worth twice as much as the salary of the employee. \n\n First, you have to accept the basic premise that ANY money or labor that you get from the bottom 50% of the income tax filers is a plus. That's because TODAY, the bottom 50% only pay 4% of ALL income taxes.\n Now, the lowest gov wage level is a G-1, which is ~$20k/year + benefits @10 years service. Realistically, many governmental employees up to G-5 can be replaced with trained monkeys, so training is minimal. G-5 @10 years is ~$31k + benefits. The benefits easily cost 50% of wages, so total costs per employee to the public range from $30k-$45K. For every one of these employees that we can replace with essentially \"free labor\", we save that amount. The fact that we're using labor derived from people working to pay their fair share in the operation of the government is pure gravy since today we don't get any taxes OR labor from this segment.\n \n\n Beyond that, this means that employees would be working for pennies. $10 an hour with no benefits? Might as well just pick up a second job at the local McDonald's. \n \n That would give the unemployed or under-employed person motivation to get a second job. I see that as a plus. As it is today, 1/2 of the \"workforce\" makes decisions affecting taxation that they don't have a stake in either positively or negatively. This way, if there's a vote to raise taxes by 10%, that directly affects EVERYONE. For those who can pay, it'll cost them 10% more in cash. For those who can't pay cash, their required number of hours of gov't work will increase by 10%.\n \n\n And I would say that is basically what you are arguing for here: a system in which the middle and lower class is taxed far more than they would be in our current graudated tax system, and if they can't afford it, they just have to get a second job.\n\n Essentially correct. Every able-bodied American should have an equal responsibility to maintain the government that we ALL voted to fund. The choise that the individual has is to pay your fair share or to provide the equivalent in labor.",

   ".......\n Well, I don't think living in a free government should be a privledge, a free government exists to protect the people's rights and happiness. The people don't exist to serve the government, the government exists to serve the people. You don't owe something because you live in the US, we contribute to the US because we need it to protect us. It is the government which has instituted this system of capitalism, and the reason for this is not because some people deserve to live better than others. The reason for capitalism is that it creates the best life for everyone. But in as much as we can fix the problems of capitalism, like the fact that it does indeed elevate some people over others in its nature, we should do so. We don't promote capitalism for the sake of promoting capitalism, we promote it for the sake of the people.\n\n \n There's a difference between a \"government of the free\" and a \"free government\". No government is free. There are expenses that have to be paid to run that government. What you propose above is that some should get a free ride and not have any responsibility towards the funding of the government. I disagree with that philosophy. I believe that everyone who benefits from the government should pay for that government.\n \n\n Well, you're talking about tax cuts here; the flat tax system you are proposing isn't any more capable of making those cuts than our graduated one. If we could cut those taxes, yes, it would be nice. It wouldn't be a horrible thing to lose too many government jobs because they likely would be replaced, but it may indeed be a horrible thing to lose the services provided by those government jobs. Government jobs do not produce nothing, after all, even though they may be less efficient.\n\n There's almost nothing that the government does better than the private sector. That's a given.\n \n\n That's only capitalist Hell. In capitalism, most people cannot afford to fund their good ideas.\n\n Really? I'm the grandson of a teenage Italian immigrant who came to the US penniless with a small suitcase and a willingness to work. That was all. He died 97 years later, having started from scratch and run two businesses, one successful, one not, in his lifetime and leaving his widow comfortable. So, I guess you can imagine that I don't buy that excuse.\n \n\n Isn't the employee risking his salary too? If an employee fails to create a good product, he'll likely be fired; if the horse racer loses all his races, he won't long be a horse racer.\n\n No, he's paid for ALL of his work. The only thing that he may risk is future security. As for the jockey, good jockeys (who win more) are paid more than average jockeys, because they're in higher demand. Capitalism works.\n \n\n Regardless, I don't think that having a direct financial stake in the outcome indicates what is fair at all. After all, it is captialism which created the situation in which only the upper class are able to afford that risk. Capitalism is a system in which a person with a lot of money tries to pay people less than the value of their work in hopes of making a profit. Well, that's not exactly true, for it would still be capitalism if they all split the profit evenly, but that isn't realistically what happens.\n\n I've already dispelled the myth that only the rich can afford risk, so I'll address the second point. A smart employer pays his employees a little above what the true value of their labor is if he wants to retain them.\n \n\n I don't think that's true; it may be true that the more money you could lose, the greater the reward. But for some people, gambling an amount of money might mean that they can't buy that third house. For another, gambling that same amount of money might mean that his family starves to death in the streets. It's the same reward, but a greater risk depending on one's social status.\n\n Money knows no socio-economic status. Once it's handed from person A to person B, it matters not what person A's status is. In other words, you're trying to make a distinction on money based on its history. And it's history doesn't really matter. If I go into Burger King and hand the cashier a $5 bill, the cashier doesn't care if I drove there in a Rolls or a VW, I get the same benefit from that $5 bill. All the rest is just class envy.\n You, of all people, should appreciate that. You don't want the government making moral decisions on your sexuality, but you do want it to make moral decisions based on your income level? emoticon_confused",

I believe that everyone who benefits from the government should pay for that government.\n\n \n Well, it's going to be tough to have this debate; it would be helpful for you to read all of my posts from the beginning if you haven't already, but that would be really boring and tedious, so don't feel too pressured to do that. However, I certainly did not suggest that anyone should get a free ride. I did suggest that the term \"fair\" implies that people who work equal amounts get paid equal amounts.\n \n \nThere's almost nothing that the government does better than the private sector. That's a given.\n\n \n That isn't a given; that ideal fails to acknowledge the problems of capitalism, primarily that certain decisions about some businesses (such as which laws to enforce) need to be decided by elected officials, not by the heads of a business. Another example is that there are some businesses which we just can't afford to let collapse, such as our public schools. Capitalism is not better at everything; it just wastes less money.\n \n \nReally? I'm the grandson of a teenage Italian immigrant who came to the US penniless with a small suitcase and a willingness to work. That was all. He died 97 years later, having started from scratch and run two businesses, one successful, one not, in his lifetime and leaving his widow comfortable. So, I guess you can imagine that I don't buy that excuse.\n\n \n Well I'm glad your grandfather was able to live the American Dream, but I happen to know a few people who are living in poverty after attempting to start a company and failing. None of them started wealthy. It isn't that they weren't willing to work, to try it, they just weren't smart enough, creative enough, or lucky enough to make it work. Maybe your grandfather was, but I'm sure he didn't put in more work than some of these guys. But a lot of people take that risk and fail, and far more are afraid to take it because they know what happens if they fail.\n \n \nNo, he's paid for ALL of his work. The only thing that he may risk is future security. As for the jockey, good jockeys (who win more) are paid more than average jockeys, because they're in higher demand. Capitalism works.\n\n \n Yet future security is indeed a risk; isn't that the same thing that most upper class people are risking? Good jockeys do get paid more, but they do the same amount of work as average jockeys; they just aren't as good. Capitalism rewards ability to make money, and sometimes that involves hard work, but often hard work gets you nowhere. \n \n I've never said that capitalism doesn't work, but capitalism does have problems, and it is in the best interest of our society to fix those problems when we find them. What I did say is that we should stick with the graduated tax system.\n \n \nI've already dispelled the myth that only the rich can afford risk, so I'll address the second point. A smart employer pays his employees a little above what the true value of their labor is if he wants to retain them.\n\n \n You've provided one example of success, which has nothing to do with the point I made.\n \n The point of capitalism is that an employer never pays his employees the value that their labor produces. An employer exists to make a profit, so he will pay his employees as little money as possible to get the largest possible profit. An employer might pay an employee more than the next employer, but that doesn't mean that he has paid them anything near the value of their work. Capitalism in its nature exists to be unfair, to give some people more money for doing the same amount of work.\n \n \nMoney knows no socio-economic status. Once it's handed from person A to person B, it matters not what person A's status is. In other words, you're trying to make a distinction on money based on its history.

You don't want the government making moral decisions on your sexuality, but you do want it to make moral decisions based on your income level? emoticon_confused\n\n \n I don't know what you mean when you say that I'm trying to make a distinction about the history of money. The point of my posts in this thread have been to defend the graduated income tax. In overview, my reasoning is multi-faceted. In short, on the economic side of things, reducing taxes on the wealthy is beneficial in times of high employment because it can increase both supply and demand by providing new jobs, but reducing taxes on the lower class is beneficial in times of good employment because it increases demand while supply is unable to increase because we already have strong employment. Judging from past experience, a strong employment rate is very achievable using a graduated tax. On the moral side of things, our government has instituted a system of economics, capitalism, which benefits some people over others for doing the same amount of work. It implicitly does not pay people the value that their work produces while paying upper class individuals large sums of money. This is not really fair, and the standard of living of many people can be increased through a graduated tax.\n \n The idea that the earned income of one man is being taken and given to another would be valid if we assumed that the first man really did earn that income. But in fact, both men likely worked just as hard, but one was able to better use the government-chosen economic system to bring himself money. What he earned depends on how the government implements capitalism. Certainly for capitalism to work, the upper class must earn more than others, but we are able to mitigate the effects on equality with a graduated tax system.\n \n I want the government to treat my sexual orientation fairly and equally, just as I want the government to treat our workers fairly and equally. I think the graduated income tax is a good way of doing that.",
