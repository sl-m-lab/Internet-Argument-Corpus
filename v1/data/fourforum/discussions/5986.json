I supported Bush's reasons for invading Iraq, and have considered it a part of the broader war on terror even if Bush didn't originall justify it that way.\n \n But it is becoming obvious there is no hope in sight of Iraq truly becoming a safe place anytime soon. Every day there are dozens of civilians being killed there--not just soldiers but children as well. According to the shias there, Iraq is on the verge of civil war. The situation truly is becoming desperate. \n \n I've had to come full circle and change my mind on this war. It's one thing for our military to suffer losses in battle; that's what our service people understand is a real possibility when they sign up. And it's bad when it happens of course. But when there is systematic killing going on in the populace of innocent people, and that killing began as an indirect result of this war, we need to step back and take a long, hard look at whether this was the right thing to do. When I say \"we\", I mean conservatives who support this war. There's no shame in saying the other side of the aisle was right about some of this.\n \n No, it does not mean Bush should be impeached. It does not mean he is a murderer or that his decisions were not well-intentioned. In fact it could be argued that this would have gone a lot more smoothly if the UN and more nations had been willing to help. But the bottom line is that it's becoming plainly obvious that the war in Iraq isn't working. I've given the adminstration the benefit of the doubt on this too long; they simply made a bad decision to invade. There's no other way around it. We need to admit this was a bad idea and try to make the best we can of it, knowing that it's probably going to be a horrible situation even after we leave Iraq. We simply can't be their police force indefintely, even if we DID make the mess. Our servicepeople deserve better than that. \n \n I hope that somehow, the upcoming constitution for Iraq will help things. I hope that the people of Iraq, who are in a no-win situation, can somehow find hope in the fact that they can vote now and participate in a democratic process. But if I had to choose between that and the safety of my children from suicide bombers, I'd put my children first. In a heartbeat.

Regarding THIS war, I am now anti-war as well. I can't sit by any longer reading and seeing the carnage over there and support this. I know the media has presented a lopsided picture, but regardless of whatever else is happening in Iraq, innocent people in masse are still dying needlessly. And it's not that I don't blame Zarqawi and the terrorists. They are directly at fault. But we have to step back and admit now that the Iraqi occupation was, overall, simply a bad idea.",

   "Yet I don't think the public really had the impression this was going to be such a long-term ordeal. Face it--Bush thought this was going to be another quick take-over such as what happened in Afganistan.\nSome of us did recognize that this problem would take a long time to solve, that military action was only a necessary first step, and that any long-term solution requires the defeat of the ideology which supports terrorism as a legitmate means to a political end.\n \n This is not a conflict like WWII or the Cold War, where the opposing sides are states with territory, people and an economy to defend. The situation we face is more like the one the civilized world faced at the end of the nineteenth century when the opponents were the anarchists. Barbara Tuchman's book Proud Tower (a history of the decades leading up to WWI) has a section on this conflict that cost so many leaders in Europe and the US - including presidents Garfield and McKinley - and that has an eerie resemblance to our current problem. Like the terrorist problem we have now, it was an utterly futile protest right from the start: a protest without a proposed alternative by a group that was unable to organize politically because it was against their principles. Tuchman pointed out that there were two distinct types of anarchists: the \"intellectuals\" who theorized and made speeches, and the activists who were inspired by the speeches and went out to make the bombs. That corresponds pretty well to the modern terrorist problem.\n \n Eventually the anarchists assassinated Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo and triggered WWI, after which the movement declined (and was replaced by socialists who agitated for greater government control).\n \n Irrational protests are a common response by people who simply can't handle reality and are frustrated by their failure. Look at the Democrats. Since 1994, the voters of the US have made it very clear that they do not want liberals in control of the US Congress - are they going quietly into that good night? No, they are engaging in mindless obstructionism without offering any positive alternatives. So why should we expect the terrorists (the modern equivalent of anarchists) to be any different?\n \n One solution to the problem is to drain the swamp where the terrorist culture flourishes by giving the people a positive outlet for their energies and giving them the means and the organizational structure to earn and enjoy the good life that we in the West have, thereby reducing enthusiasm on their part for a return to the 7th century. The Bush administration hopes to do that by creating a free and self-governing Iraq, a representative government that will provide an attractive alternative (and example) to the dictatorships that have plagued the area for centuries. We will aggressively hunt down and kill the activists who organize and carry out the terrorist attacks, but to solve the deeper problem we must give their supporters - the ones who provide the guns, bullets and bombs - more attractive alternatives on which to spend their money, time and effort.\n \n At the other end of the spectrum of possible solutions, we could always turn the entire Middle East into a glowing glass parking lot. The middle road, often called the Kissinger model after its most ardent proponent in recent history, is to replace an unfriendly dictator with a friendly dictator. It's a method that was satisfactory (and relatively cheap) for many centuries, but doesn't work very well against an ideology in this age of instant communication. The French solution won't work either - how do you surrender to someone who wants to kill you just to demonstrate his dedication to a cause?\n \n So, yes, the problem will take decades to resolve. Killing the terrorists is necessary, but the ideology that spawns them has to be defeated in the marketplace of ideas and that is going to take a very long time indeed.",

   "Well done.Its worthless to you as a person when you let party lines and prejudices get in the way of the truth and facts.And the fact was that Iraq was a bad mistake,not necassarily the invasion itself(although it clearly takes away from Afghanistan,Saudi Arabia and Pakistan among other things)but the badly failing attempt to build a democracy in the country.The less partisans out there that refuse to accept the blindingly obvious truth and that use worthless and moronic comparison's with the US civil war/WW2 with Iraq the better.\n \n \nI'm sure that people felt misgivings during our Civil War. To have stopped half way would have allowed the institution of slavery to continue on in the South. Would that have been a good idea? We lost about 700,000 dead. Was it worth it? I think so.\n\n \n Please explain how both Iraq and the US civil war are in any way related.Clearly the US/Iraqi dead in Iraq is not comparible to those in the civil war and I have a strange feeling that if 700,000 Iraqi civilians died for an illiberal Iraqi democracy(which,at best,is where Iraq is heading) then the 'liberation' would be seen as the biggest military blunder since Napolean thought logistical nightmares and freezing winters go well together.\n \n \nHow many more people would have died if Saddam had remained in power?\n\n \n Impossible to tell but there can be little doubt that,for the Iraqi people,hopefully things will get better now that Saddam is gone.But then again getting rid of the sanctions would have saved thousands of lives as well.500,000 at least according to Albright. \n \n \nThe U.N. was corrupt and the sanctions were falling apart.\n\n \n Yes the US/GB(using inspectors to spy)and France/China/Russia(immoral oil contracts)were corrupt.The sanctions were strongly supported by the US,while France/Russia/China wanted to loosen them to a certaint extent.\n \n \nAnd think about this. Bush told us from Day 1 that this would be a long and difficult struggle\n\n \n Didn't many within the US think,from what the INC reliably told them,that they would be showered with flowers etc when they 'liberated' Iraq?\n \n \nSuppose this continues for the next ten years. If it prevents another 9/11 or that inevitable nuclear cloud, is it is worth it? I think so.\n\n \n Fantastic fallacy.I guess when cold hard logic and truth escapes you,you feel the need to sacre people with illogical lies and scaremongering warnings about nuclear clouds right?There was no Al-Qaeda/Iraq link.Saddam didn't have nuclear weapons or any kind of WMD's after 9/11.Nor would Saddam give WMD's to a group that despised secular Arab states.All inescapable facts but keep the scaremongering coming,its all you got left.\n \n \nJust imagine what it will be like if our economy collapses and there is anarchy in our streets because Al Queda has forced us out of Iraq and they succeed in worldwide Islamic tyranny.\n\n \n More retarded scare mongering.\n \n \n Bin Laden has stated that it is the duty of all Muslims to kill Americans. In actual numbers he said that he wants to kill 4,000,000 Americans and 2,000,000 American chlldren to \"even the score.\" Are you prepared to see that happen? I'm not.\n\n \n Bin Laden is completely useless now and the new wave of Islamist militants are different.\n \n \nI'm not. I'd rather fight them there\n\n \n Your not fighting Al-Qaeda in Iraq.\n \n \nAnd remember too, that thousands upon thousands of Europeans were killed by Allied bombing when we were on the way to defeating Nazi tyranny. True peace never comes cheap. We can have \"peace in our time\" or we can stand up on our own two hind legs and say \"enough is enough\" and do something about it.

Ever?\n \n \nAnd the UN (i.e. American troops with UN helmets) will be forced to go in and help stop the murder of non-combatants.\n\n And rape little girls...\n \n\n Remember, the war in Iraq has only been going on for little more than two years. \n\n Is that all?\n \n \nWe've been in Afghanistan much longer than Iraq, yet noone is demanding that we pull out of there. What would you say if we pulled out of Iraq and attacks started in earnest in Afghanistan? Would you suggest we pull out of there as well?\n\n What the hell are you talking about?\n Did we not \"start in earnest\" in Afghanistan?\n \n And no, we can't pull out of there.\n It would be too easy for the Taliban to reclaim control.\n \n \nI think this would have gone a lot better if we had received help from the UN and nations initially opposed to the invasion following the removal of Saddam from power.

   "Well thats fine for you sir. I hope you can really justify your decision when Iraq becomes a thriving democratic government. SOME of us here believe in democracy,work,success, the American dream, and the pursuit of happines for all.\n\n \n I do as well, but come on. It isn't happening in Iraq. I'll be the first to say Iraq is nothing in comparison to Vietnam, but let's face it, after Vietnam we should at least be able to step back and say that a govt (even a Repuiblican one) can make a bad decision to go to war. I'm not saying Bush should be impeached or anything here. I'm simply saying that I think it would be best for conservatives to step back and take another long hard look at this thing. One of the biggest problems is that there is a HUGE cultural difference between here and there. When you speak of things like the American dream, democracy, and the 'pursuit of happiness,' you're speaking of things we all agree with for America. But trying to fit a middle eastern culture into that mold isn't happening right now. I hope Iraq does make it, and I hope there is a good democracy there in years to come. But in my opinion, this was a bad idea.\n \n \nIt seems to me that one who spoke so wholehardidly for Iraq and the decision such as yourself would not be influenced by the endless bombardment of comments and sarcastic remarks made my the left wing peoples on this forum.\n\n \n For me, the sarcastic remarks of people on this forum had nothing to do with it. No one 'convinced' me of it--the situation itself convinced me. I'm just dealing with reality, that's all.",

You make some valid points on the differences, but it still took seven years or so before we turned German affairs over to Germans completely and it would appear from your argument that we will be in Iraq for much longer. I'm more optimistic, partly because Iraq has such a huge revenue source in its oil production, and partly because Iraq suffered much less destruction from the brief war (although the destruction from neglect by Saddam is far more serious because he was in power so much longer than Hitler). We will leave at their request, just as soon as they can defend themselves from their neighbor terrorists.\n \n\n \n From a US economic standpoint, which dictates politics, they're 180-degrees apart. All European countries participating in the Marshall Plan, including Germany, provided markets for US industrial capacity amassed, using US capital, by WW2. Our tax revenue from those exports were the basis of our immense national wealth and unparalleled growth in standard of living. Our businesses owned Western Europe and they wanted us there. It was in our best interests to remain in Germany and control the rebuilding to facilitate our product markets and investments. It was in Germany's best interests for us to remain there.\n \n Comparing post-WW2 Germany to post-invasion Iraq, especially political considerations which dictate trade, is way, way off the mark. Iraq doesn't want us there, we're a potential market for their single commodity resource economy with almost zero reciprocal trade resulting in increased payment imbalance and doing nothing but burning off our national wealth, wounding and killing our military while looking like not very smart tyrants to the rest of the world. \n \n But some in the US have prospered from the Iraq folly, which is what it takes to support an action derived from deception, poor planning and almost criminal actuality by supporting one participant of a civil war with no positive return for our country. Those who haven't prospered and do support our actions in Iraq will, hopefully, outgrow their idealism and exercise some effort to concern themselves with the US, not using force to achieve nation building in third-world sovereign countries.",

   "Venezuala,Russia,Nigeria,Saudi Arabia the list goes on for resource rich countries that turn into,at best illiberal democracies.\nThere's a lot of truth to that, but it doesn't just apply to oil. When wealth came primarily from agricultural resources, we called them banana republics. I read an essay some time back that listed a number of countries and their resources, and concluded that when sales of any one commodity got into the range of 27-30% of gdp it made too tempting a target. The commodity became high profile, got nationalized, and subsequently exploited by whichever group of bandits had enough firepower to manage a \"people's revolution.\" Whether the commodity is bananas in Nicaragua, copper in Katanga (which tried unsuccessfully to secede from Zaire in the sixties), diamonds in west Africa, or oil in Iraq, the problem is the same -- it's not the greed of the outside world that offers to buy the commodity, it's the local hogs jostling each other to feed at money trough the commodity brings in. \n \n Bush's approach to Iraq and Afghanistan, which hasn't been tried since WWII (and may not work), is to create a free society where the people choose the government and hold it accountable at the ballot box. This is much different from the Cold War \"Wars of Liberation\" where the motto was \"One man, one vote, one time.\" It will only have a chance of being successful if we stick around to support the elected government like we did in Germany and Japan; if we cut and run like the left demands, we are guaranteeing a descent into more (and possibly worse) despotism.",

It is Democrats who start wars they don't have the attention span to finish.\n\n So you don't think that the war started with Eisenhower?\n \n http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/vietnam/causes.htm\n \n The administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower undertook instead to build a nation from the spurious political entity that was South Vietnam by fabricating a government there, taking over control from the French, dispatching military advisers to train a South Vietnamese army, and unleashing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to conduct psychological warfare against the North.\n \n As presidents committed the United States to conflict bit by bit, many of these ambitions were forgotten. Instead, inertia developed against withdrawing from Vietnam. Washington believed that U.S. withdrawal would result in a Communist victory--Eisenhower acknowledged that, had elections been held as scheduled in Vietnam in 1956, \"Ho Chi Minh would have won 80% of the vote\"--and no U.S. president wanted to lose a country to communism. Democrats in particular, like Kennedy and Johnson, feared a right-wing backlash should they give up the fight; they remembered vividly the accusatory tone of the Republicans' 1950 question, \"Who lost China?\" The commitment to Vietnam itself, passed from administration to administration, took on validity aside from any rational basis it might once have had. Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy all gave their word that the United States would stand by its South Vietnamese allies. If the United States abandoned the South Vietnamese, its word would be regarded as unreliable by other governments, friendly or not. So U.S. credibility seemed at stake.",

I don't mean politically motivated organisations like moveon.org.\n\n \n \n \n Here is one somewhat related link that has some nice good quotes from US government officials regarding Iraqi reconstruction\n http://www.house.gov/schakowsky/iraqquotes_web.htm\n Here are a few\n \nPress Secretary Ari Fleischer: \"Well, the reconstruction costs remain a very -- an issue for the future. And Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, is a rather wealthy country. Iraq has tremendous resources that belong to the Iraqi people. And so there are a variety of means that Iraq has to be able to shoulder much of the burden for their own reconstruction\n \n Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld: \"If you [Source: worry about just] the cost, the money, Iraq is a very different situation from Afghanistan...Iraq has oil. They have financial resources.\" [Source: Fortune Magazine, Fall 2002]\n\n \n A far more related link and very recent. It mentions 21 billion which is 3 billion higher then number that I have seeen previously\n \n http://www.suntimes.com/output/iraq/cst-nws-iraq19.html\n \n \nBASRA, Iraq -- The United States has yet to spend almost 60 percent  of its pledged $21 billion in reconstruction money for Iraq, even as the country struggles through a third summer of sporadic electricity and limited clean water.\n \n snip\n \n Iraq's ongoing violence has been one factor, both delaying projects by keeping U.S. engineers huddled on bases far from project sites and eating into the pledged American money, taking up between 20 to 23 percent of project costs, according to the Project Construction Office.\n \n \n\n \n Here is a good one regarding the missing Iraqi money and inflated contracts to western companies.\n \n http://www.wbai.org/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=6133&Itemid=2\n Please note the Interpressservice tag at the front which indicates that the information is widely distrubuted and can be found in other places\n \nInterPress Service, June 29, 2005) As a Congressional committee heard testimony last week that billions of Iraqi dollars  -- held in trust by the U.S. government -- still cannot be accounted for, the inspector general charged with tracking the funds said he has referred three contractors to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecutions for fraud\n \n The DFI is the successor to the United Nations' oil-for-food program. The multi-billion-dollar fund, which is composed of Iraqi oil revenue and other Iraqi assets, was run by the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority  until last year. \n \n snip\n \n Both Republicans and Democrats appeared taken aback by the volume of cash sent to Iraq: nearly 12 billion dollars over the course of the U.S. occupation from March 2003 to June 2004. \n \n snip\n \n The largest single recipient of Iraqi funds was Halliburton, the oil services firm once led by U.S. Vice Pres. Dick Cheney, which received 1.6 billion dollars in Iraqi oil proceeds under a contract to import fuel and repair oil fields. According to DCAA auditors, Halliburton's overcharges under this contract are more than 218 million dollars. \n \n A security firm, Custer Battles, received over 11 million dollars in Iraqi funds, including over 4 million in cash. The company has been barred from receiving federal contracts and faces a False Claims Act lawsuit for multiple fraudulent billings. \n \n Over 600 million dollars in cash was shipped from Baghdad to four regions in Iraq to allow commanders flexibility to fund local reconstruction projects. An audit of one of the four regions found more than 80 percent of the funds could not be properly accounted for and that over 7 million dollars in cash was missing. \n continued\n \n\n \n Now for Paul Bremer\n [quote]Hague regulations of 1907 (the companion to the 1949 Geneva conventions, both ratified by the United States), as well as the US army's own code of war\n \n \nThe Hague regulations state that an occupying power must respect \"unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country\". The coalition provisional authority has shredded that simple rule with gleeful defiance.\n \n Iraq's constitution outlaws the privatisation of key state assets, and it bars foreigners from owning Iraqi firms. No plausible argument can be made that the CPA was \"absolutely prevented\" from respecting those laws, and yet two months ago, the CPA overturned them unilaterally. \n \n On September 19, Bremer enacted the now infamous Order 39. It announced that 200 Iraqi state companies would be privatised; decreed that foreign firms can retain 100% ownership of Iraqi banks, mines and factories; and allowed these firms to move 100% of their profits out of Iraq. The Economist declared the new rules a \"capitalist dream\".  \n Order 39 violated the Hague regulations in other ways as well. The convention states that occupying powers \"shall be regarded only as administrator and usufructuary of public buildings, real estate, forests and agricultural estates belonging to the hostile state, and situated in the occupied country. It must safeguard the capital of these properties, and administer them in accordance with the rules of usufruct.\" \n \n The security council's recognition of the United States' and Britain's occupation authority provides no legal cover. The UN resolution passed in May specifically required the occupying powers to \"comply fully with their obligations under international law including in particular the Geneva conventions of 1949 and the Hague regulations of 1907\". \n \n According to a growing number of international legal experts, that means that if the next Iraqi government decides it doesn't want to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Bechtel and Halliburton, it will have powerful legal grounds to renationalise assets that were privatised under CPA edicts. \n \n Juliet Blanch, global head of energy and international arbitration for the huge international law firm Norton Rose, says that because Bremer's reforms directly contradict Iraq's constitution, they are \"in breach of international law and are likely not enforceable\". Blanch argues that the CPA \"has no authority or ability to sign those [privatisation] contracts\", and that a sovereign Iraqi government would have \"quite a serious argument for renationalisation without paying compensation\". Firms facing this type of expropriation would, according to Blanch, have \"no legal remedy\". \n\n \n Now, that is not to say that I am against privatization of state enterprises. But it should be the decision of the Iraqi people, made to benifit the Iraqi people, at a time where the Iraqi people will profit the most from the sale.\n \n A fire sale of Iraqi enterprises during a time of crisis by non Iraqis, in my opinion falls into the \" looting \" category.",

However, if I were a qualified medical statistician and I wanted to do a study of your situation within a decent-sized population of individuals who are in the situation I'd probably be offering you all sorts of inducements to participate in a controlled study.\n \n Dancing Girls, Sartre! Hmmmm, trying to think of luscious inducements that wouldn't kill off someone with your medical conditions--booze, steak dinners, etc., etc., can't use those because I definitely do not want to kill off the subject!!!!

The majority of people in the US form their political (and most other) opinions based on peer group association including belief systems, family influence, political affiliation and general media reporting. Once an often biased and shallow opinion is formulated, seldom do they look at facts, resulting in little if any position change.
