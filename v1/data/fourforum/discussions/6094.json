   "No particular order...\n \n 1. Pearl Jam - amazing variety of songs, from both an emotional and stylistic point of view, combined with awesome talent on the guitar (Mike McCready) and drums (latest and seemingly now permanent drummer, ex-Soundgarden Matt Cameron) and vocals (Mr Vedder himself). What I love about their songs is that even though the lyrics can be obscure at times, they are all essentially stories, which gives them their emotional impact. Although I've never seen them live, I have 3 live recordings which reveal their ability to only ever improve on their studio CDs when they are on stage. Spellbinding.\n \n 2. Devin Townsend Band - like nothing else I've ever listened to, the Dev manages to create some of the most awe-inspiring, beautiful, yet at times bone-crunchingly heavy music you can imagine. Imagine a monstrous Metallica epic, add an orchestra and a plethora of sythesised effects, and imagine it somehow not seeming cheesy, overblown or pretentious because of the obvious sense of humour and enjoyment, sheer indulgence in being able to create such powerful music. And I'm only talking about the 3rd and 4th albums here, the 1st being a weird, dark embryonic version of the later material, and the 2nd, Infinity, should be in everyone's collection as it is an amalgamation of every style of Western music you can imagine, chopped up and put through a blender by a madman. There is so much talent in this band it's hard to believe.\n \n 3. Tool - again, like nothing else I've ever listened to. Dark and brooding without being over-the-top or self-pitying, Tool do passion and anger like no-one else; even on the hundredth listen to the title track from their latest offering, Lateralus, it's impossible not to get lost in the song. It just reaches right into your head and heart with no resistance and makes your emotions follow it all the way to the piledriving climax. Authority. That's what Tool have. You just have to sit up and take notice. Combine this hard-to-define musical aspect with unbelievable songwriting ability, rhythmic complexity and at times ambiguity, and Maynard's haunting voice and you have something that you have to call 'metal', but which is in fact just out there on its own. Tool are the Pink Floyd of the 21st century.\n \n 4. Hendrix - Obviously. While there are plenty of bands from the 50s, 60s and 70s I could name, who have all produced a vast catalogue of classic music and been indispensably influential, Hendrix's guitar style changed everything and I listen to him far more than I do Sabbath, Zep, Stones, Clapton, Bowie, Eagles or Floyd because you just can't help but enjoy the combination of measureless talent, passion and sheer love of making music on every song.\n \n 5. The White Stripes - another band that sound like no-one else. With their roots firmly in the country and western tradition, they have come up with an amazing stylistic variety whilst still retaining that c&w feel, especially on their new album. I was never a fan until Glastonbury this year, thought I'd check them out on the Pyramid Stage and was absolutely entranced for the best part of 90 minutes. The most impressive things about them are the sound they produce on CD and their commanding stage presence, between just two people.",

   "NICKELBACK!???? \n \n They are the only band I ever bought a ticket for and walked out on (this was before they had any hits here - I just knew the name as I am pretty in tune with the Canadian scene). Strumming chords and whining - they are absolutely terrible. When did rock turn into a melodrama? I couldn't believe it when they made it big. I want killer guitar riffs and funky basslines. \n \n I have also had the misfortune of running into Kroeger's ego at a club in BC. Not that that moment formed this opinion, I already hated his band. He was so loud and obnoxious - freakin drunk Alberta farm boy with his Michael Bolton hair.\n \n Gag.\n \n You will have to forgive my rant. The Nickelback thing really bugs me. Most of my friends are musicians. I know bands in Canada that Nickelback cut their teeth opening for, who were better, and sweated ten times harder for a hell of a lot longer and got missed. But it's all about the cash flow so we are force fed a million Brittneys and Pear Jam wannabes (Creed, Nickelback) - now it's Green Day wannabes. I love both Pearl Jam and Green Day, but who needs a thousand copy-cats? Hearing a new sound (like the White Stripes for example - and I had the MTV beat on them by two years) is a rarity. I rarely turn on the radio anymore. I can try a dozen stations - and 90% of the time it's garbage - and when it's not it's either classic stuff or a little college station with barely any bandwidth. Nickelback sort of represent to me everything that is wrong with the music industry today. I am convinced that if a phenomenon like Zeppelin were to happen today - we would all miss out because the XXXXXX at Disney, Viacom and Clear Channel wouldn't know talent if you stuck up their collective rear and set it on fire.",

They gathered around the stage where Billy was going to play full of smart alec comments about Billy and his age. Five minutes after Billy hit the stage the girls were screaming and boys were surfing. When Steve Stevens let loose, it may have been the first time those kids heard a real guitar solo.

   "My top five.\n \n 1. The Who\n 2. Cream\n 3. Led Zep\n 4. The Jam\n 5. Stone Roses\n \n I am really a fan of rock music, with the only exceptions(in my top 5) being the Stones Roses who melded rock and dance music to create an unique sound. They only produced Two albums but their influence can still be heard in the British Music scene today with bands like Oasis, Kaiser Cheifs and Kasbain.\n \n The Jam where a band that came out during the punk era, they tended to be part of the same scene but their influences where much different. They harked back to the days of the Mods in the 60s and like those mods they where influenced by Motown and Northern Soul. The early Jam records where very much like punk albums but as the band evolved you could hear the influence of Northern Soul in records like Town Called Malice and Beat Surrender.\n \n I guess most people have heard of Led Zeppelin so I will not say much about them except that they ROCK emoticon_xgood \n \n Cream where a 60s band that could be called the first Rock super group, it consisted of Eric Clapton on Guitar and vocal, Jack Bruce on Base and Vocals and Ginger Baker on drums. They produced music that was a mix of jazz and blues with heavier guitars of course. In my opinion they practically invented Heavy Rock music and if you listen to any Heavy Rock band such as Led Zeppelin you can clearly hear the influence of Cream. \n \n The Who don't need any introduce just suffice it to say that they where a band(and still are to a certain extent) that had the perfect blend of musicians.",
