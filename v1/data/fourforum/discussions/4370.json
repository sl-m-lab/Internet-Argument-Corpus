The Cross was not used as a Christian symbol until the 4th century, and not used on tombs until the mid 5th.\n \n That alone should tell you that it was suspect. \n \n \n Then, there is the conclusion that the coins from 17 A.D. means the tombs were seals by 70 A.D. In a similar situation, Another first century Jewish catacomb at the southern end of the Kidron valley was investigated by Dr. Eleazar Sukenik of Hebrew University in 1945. Several ossuaries with the sign of the cross, Greek inscriptions, and a coin minted in A.D. 41 for King Herod Agrippa 1 were found, indicating a sealing date by 42 A.D. Professor Sukenik concluded the ossuaries \"contain almost the whole dictionary of names in the New Testament.\"\n \n Now, why does one coin in a tomb dating from 41 A.D means the tomb was seals by 42 A.D. in one case, while 5 coins dating from 17 A.D mean that the tome was sealed before 70 A.D.??\n \n I would say that since that the 5 coins from 17 A.D. means the tomb was sealed by 20 A.D., and the fact that the cross was not used as a christian symbol till after the 4th century means the christian symbols on the tombs were added after that.",

   "Here's something to start with:\n \n Historical Evidence for the Gospel Accounts of Jesus Christ \n \n http://www.sundayschoolcourses.com/histjesu/histjesu.htm\n\n Okay... let's start with that, Easyrider. In fact, let's start with the question of the historical existence of Nazareth as described by the gospels prior to the dawn of the first century A.D. when Jesus allegedly lived there.\n \n The site you referenced concedes the following: \n 1) Nazareth is not mentioned in the Old Testament\n \n 2) Josephus gives the names of 45 towns and villages in Galilee. Nazareth is not among them!\n \n 3) The Jewish Talmud mentions 63 towns and villages in the area. Nazareth is not among them.\n \n Yet your site does not respond to these points in any way. Don't you find it odd that Josephus mentions 45 towns located in an area that would fit into a 30 mile by 30 mile square... yet he doesn't mention Nazareth? Your site does not explain this anomoly. This point alone casts a shadow of doubt on the premise that Nazareth existed when Christ was allegedly born. And it corroborates with the Jewish Talmud and the Old Testament... neither of which mention Nazareth. Can you explain that?\n \n Instead of explaining the oddities mentioned above, the site you referenced makes these two claims (as if to suggest that the above points are moot): \n 1) Excavations by Bellarmino Bagatti in 1955 have shown that there was an agricultural settlement on the site identified in the New Testament as Nazareth. The site dates back as far as 900 years before Christ. Evidence of use during the Roman occupation has been found.\n \n 2) Also, excavations by Michael Avi-Yonah at Caesarea in 1962 unearthed a tablet with the name \"Nazareth\" contained on it. The tablet demonstrates that Nazareth existed at least as early as first century A.D.\n \n Yet the first claim above is questionable, as the evidence uncovered by Bagatti suggests that the site was funerary -- not a village called Nazareth with a synagogue and a nearby cliff from which the villagers threatened to throw him. \n \n And it appears that there is uncertainty about the second claim above as well... I found a reference indicating that the excavations by Avi-Yonah date to the late third or early fourth century. Not to the first century as your reference suggests. So... this point should probably be cleared up as well.\n \n (I trust that in your research, you have likely read the article at this site.)\n \n My challenge to you is a) to offer a reasonable and logical explanation that explains why Josephus would fail to mention Nazareth in his writings; and b) to provide solid evidence that Avi-Yonah's excavations date to the first century A.D.\n \n Sound fair enough?\n \n Peace,\n The Bootfitter",

   "It wasn't weak in my opinion. \n\n True, that was a value judgment on my part. True, you may have opinions that are different than mine. Let's put it this way... there are other logical conclusions that can be drawn other than the argument put forth by the website you referenced to the fact that Josephus doesn't mention Nazareth.\n \n \nFirst, he wasn't a Christian. Second, his list was not inclusive of all towns and villages, etc., in Israel. Third, it was insignificant in size. Fourth, you tell me why he left out some others (check the Old Testament for all the known places in Israel) and you might have an inkling about why he didn't mention Nazareth. \n\n 1. It is irrelevant whether Josephus was Christian. If Nazareth existed in historical reality, then it existed for Christians and non-Christians alike.\n 2. I didn't suggest that his list included all towns, villages, & cities in Israel. Rather I asked whether you are aware if there were other villages comparable to Nazareth in size and function that Josephus also excluded from his list of towns in Galilee.\n 3. You claim it was insignificant in size, and yet Matthew calls it a city? Are you aware of other insignificant villages in Galilee around the dawn of the first century that has a synagogue?\n 4. See my response to your second point. We're talking about Galilee... not Israel.\n \n \nYours is an argument from silence, which isn't a very strong case.\n\n I am not suggesting it is a strong case. I'm suggesting that it merely casts a shadow of doubt on the idea that Nazareth did, in fact, exist. I'm allowing you the opportunity to present evidence that sheds light on the shadow of doubt. So far, the shadow is still there.\n \n \nI'm not an archaeologist nor would I particularly know where to look for that.\n\n Then, I guess we cannot use the findings from the Avi-Yonah excavations as part of the evidence one way or another, if we don't know conclusively when they are dated to.\n \n \nObviously Nazareth existed or it wouldn't have been mentioned so often in the different New Testament works.\n\n Sorry, Easyrider, but that's considered the fallacy of begging the question. If the question we are attempting to determine is whether or not the gospels are valid as history (i.e. Did Jesus exist as an historical human being on this earth?), then we cannot use something written in the gospels themselves to verify the idea. As far as I'm aware, all NT books were authored after the earliest gospel -- except for Paul's writings. And as far as I'm aware, Paul does not mention Nazareth anywhere in his writings.\n \n Consider --< Your statement above is analogous to somebody saying 2,000 years from now, \"Look, Metropolis and Gotham City HAD to have existed at some point in time, or they wouldn't have been mentioned so often in Superman and Batman stories. It doesn't matter if there's no credible archaological evidence to suggest that those cities existed. They HAD to exist!\"\n \n So, where are we at this point?\n You have conceded the second part of my challenge, but you have not yet offered a logical and reasonable explanation as to why Josephus would exclude an allegedly small village (or city) called Nazareth from his list of 45 towns in an area that would fit into a 30 mile by 30 mile square.

   "I haven't conceded anything.\n\n Huh? Let me show you your own words here... In response to my challenge to you \"to provide solid evidence that Avi-Yonah's excavations date to the first century A.D.\" You responded with the following statement: \"I'm not an archaeologist nor would I particularly know where to look for that.\"\n \n You concede that you are not able to meet the challenge. You cannot answer the question. That is a concession.\n \n \nWhat you're asking, though, is for me to somehow know either the mind or the criteria that Josephus used, which I doubt anyone has a remote clue about.\n\n No, I am simply asking you to come up with a reasonable and logical answer to a question as to why Josephus would have excluded Nazareth from his list of towns. I'll give you a few potential examples to illustrate the point...\n --< \"It is possible that Nazareth did not exist at this point in time, which is why Josephus would not have included it in the list.\"\n --< \"According to this archaeologist [insert valid reference here], ruins of at least four other small villages similar in size to Nazareth have been determined to have been in existence at the time Josephus lived in Galilee. Yet, like Nazareth, Josephus did not include the names of these small villages in his writings either. Therefore, it is certainly reasonable to conclude that Nazareth existed and Josephus did not document its existence.\"\n \n Is my challenge now a little more clear? I am not asking you to look inside of anybody's head but your own. Assuming Nazareth really did exist at the dawn of the first century, it shouldn't be difficult to shed a little light on that shadow of doubt.\n \n \nBut what we have is the City of Nazareth's own webpage confirming it as the city of Jesus 2000 years ago.\n\n The present day city of Nazareth is a tourist hotspot. People travel there because they believe it was where Christ lived during his youth. The tourism industry has incentive to play to those beliefs. But this is far from credible evidence that Nazareth actually existed B.C.\n \n \nWe have the historical Gospels and Book of Acts, which attest to it.\n\n It is certainly true that the gospels and Acts make references to Nazareth. But again, this is begging the question... the historical validity of these books is in question. What we need to find (and should have no problem finding assuming it is true) are independent sources to verify that Nazareth existed as described in the gospels. This would certainly lend credibility to the gospels as historical documents, right?\n \n \nAnd you have the previous information I already posted and linked you too.\n\n Easyrider, you seem to go in circles here... we are currently discussing two points from the previous information you posted. One point you conceded, and the other point, you have yet to address. Saying that something on the website that you posted answers a question about that same something on the website that you posted doesn't make sense.\n \n \nI suppose you can make a career out of skepticism on this if you want.\n\n I'm not interested in that. But I am interested in determining whether or not Nazareth actually existed at the dawn of the first century. Based on the evidence you have presented thus far, the answer seems like a fuzzy maybe at best. If it's true that Nazareth existed at that time, shouldn't we be able to determine so with a little more clarity?\n \n \nFrankly this wild goose chase is boring to me. Maybe someone else can help you chase this down.\n\n When I saw you post \"Here's something to start with:\" I thought perhaps you would have solid documentation to support your position. But, alas, when we investigate even one small aspect of the documentation that you provided in support of an historical Christ, you concede one point and give up on the other point that I asked you to support. \n \n I do wish you wouldn't give up so easily. I am completely open minded on the subject. My perspective is that IF Jesus existed as described by the gospels, then he existed. Nothing I can do, say, or believe can change that. Alternatively, IF he didn't exist as a physical human being, then he didn't exist... and nothing I can do, say or believe can change that. I am interested in discovering the historical truth of the matter. \n \n So, where are we now???\n It appears that Easyrider is unable to provide anything of substance and is giving up... so we can wait to see if anyone else can answer the opening post and provide reasonable and logical evidence for the historical existence of Jesus Christ.",

   "More than a few trees have been chopped down in order to provide for books dealing with the search for the historical Jesus. I have, over the years, read a considerable number of these books and I'm going to attempt to distill what I've gathered thus far. Jeers, mockery, and the throwing of rotten fruit is to be expected. \n \n But first, allow me to explain the nature of the problem. Almost all of the information that we have concerning Jesus comes to us from the NT. But the authors of the manuscripts which make up the NT were written by Jesus' followers, and the historicity of their accounts leaves a lot to be desired. These authors were obviously attempting to sell Jesus, and in doing so, they wrapped Jesus in layer upon layer of folklore and legend. Some believe that it is possible to peel away these layers and to thus come to an understanding of the historical Jesus.\n \n Herewith, then, my observations concerning the historical Jesus...\n [*]Jesus of Nazareth was a historical figure.[*]He was probably born in Nazareth. Stories of a census bringing Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem are almost certainly fictional.[*]His conception and birth were unremarkable [Rom 1:3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;.][*]There exists doubt as to whether Joseph was Jesus' biological father, as suggested by the following verses: Luk 3:23 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph,\n Mrk 6:3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon?. The Mark verse is most telling. Lineage was traced through the father. To state that Jesus was the son of Mary was a polite way of saying that either Jesus' father was of ill repute or that the identity of Jesus' father was not known. Add to this the fact that, shortly after Jesus' birth, Joseph seems to disappear from the radar screen.[*]The taking by Joseph of his new family to Egypt in order to avoid Jesus' being put to death is almost certainly fictional.[*]Little, if anything, is known of Jesus' early years.[*]Sometime after reaching adulthood, Jesus apparently hooked up with John the Baptist and may have, for a time, been one of John's followers. According to Mark, John baptized Jesus, which raises questions as to Jesus' alleged divinity as put forth by Matthew, Luke, and John. [*]Sometime thereafter, Jesus embarked on his own ministry, gathering followers and speaking in public.[*]His message was that of a reformer of Judaism. [*]His activities eventually came to the attention of the Romans, especially his creating a disturbance within the temple grounds on the eve of Passover along with the fact that some of his followers began to refer to him as \"King of the Jews\". A king was expected to liberate his people from foreign occupation, a fact which was not entirely lost on the Romans. [*]Thus, Pilate probably ordered one of his officers to get rid of Jesus. There would have been no trial, given that Jesus was considered a nobody. [*]He was put to death by the Romans by way of crucifixion, a very common form of death penalty.[*]His body was almost certainly not placed in a tomb. Instead, as was common practice, his body was most likely thrown into a garbage dump to be consumed by dogs and birds. This was part of the punishment that the Romans inflicted upon Jews, knowing full well that Jews placed great importance upon a proper burial of the dead. [*]There is very little evidence to suggest that Jesus of Nazareth considered himself to be divine, or that he desired to be worshipped, or that his intent was to create a new religion: Joh 20:17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God..[*]Claims that Jesus cast out demons is nothing more than a reflection of pre-scientific mentality.[*]Claims of Jesus' imminent second coming proved to be a disappointment.\n Sources: \n \n The Historical Jesus, John Dominic Crossan, Harper Collins\n Jesus of Nazareth, Paula Fredriksen, Vintage\n A History of God, Karen Armstrong, Ballantine Books\n The World's Religions, Huston Smith, Harper Collins\n The Birth of Christianity, Joel Carmichael, Dorset Press\n A History of Christian Thought, Paul Tillich, Simon&Schuster\n Who Is Jesus?, John Dominic Crossan & Richard Watts, Westminster John Knox Press\n The Message and the Kingdom, Richard Horsley and Neil Asher Silberman, Penguin Books\n The Story of Christian Theology, Roger Olson, InterVarsity Press\n The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Doubleday",

   "Orion, except for recognizing the historicity of Christ and his crucifixion, that's a load of liberal revisionism at its finest, including your stunted claim that Jesus never considered himself to be divine. Your scriptures only speak to his humanity. The scriptures which deal with his divinity were conveniently ignored and are apparently on your cutting room floor.\n \n Did Jesus Claim To Be God?\n \n Among the religious leaders who have attained a large following throughout history, Jesus Christ is unique in the fact that He alone claimed to be God in human flesh. A common misconception is that some or many of the leaders of the world's religions made similar claims, but this is simply not the case. \n Buddha did not claim to be God; Moses never said that he was Yahweh; Mohammed did not identify himself to be Ahura Mazda. Yet Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, said that he who has seen him (Jesus) has seen the Father (John 14:9).\n \n The claims of Christ are many and varied. He said that He existed before Abraham (John 8:58), and that He was equal with the Father (John 14:9). The New Testament equated Jesus as the creator of the universe (John 1:3), and that He is the one who holds everything together (Colossians 1:17). The apostle Paul says that God was manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16, KJV), and John the evangelist says that \"the Word was God\" (John 1:1). The united testimony of Jesus and the writers of the New Testament is that He was more than mere man; He was God.\n \n Not only did His friends notice that He claimed to be God, but so did His enemies as well. There may be some doubt today among the skeptics who refuse to examine the evidence, but there was no doubt on the part of the Jewish authorities. When Jesus asked them why they wanted to stone Him, they replied, \"For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God\" (John 10:33, NASB).\n \n This fact separates Jesus from the other religious figures. In the major religions of the world, the teachings -- not the teacher -- are all-important. \n Confucianism is a set of teachings; Confucius is not important. Islam is the revelation of Allah, with Mohammed being the prophet, and Buddhism emphasizes the principles of the Buddha and not Buddha himself. This is especially true of Hinduism, where there is no historic founder. \n However, at the center of Christianity is the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus did not just claim to be teaching mankind the truth; He claimed that He was the truth (John 14:6).\n \n What Jesus taught is not the important aspect of Christianity, but what is important is who Jesus was. Was He the Son of God? Is He the only way a person can reach God? This was the claim He made for Himself. \n Suppose this very night the President of the United States appeared on all the major networks and proclaimed that \"I am God Almighty. I have the power to forgive sin. I have the authority to raise my life back from the dead.\"\n \n He would be quickly and quietly shut off the air, led away, and replaced by the Vice-President. Anybody who would dare make such claims would have to be either out of his mind or a liar, unless he was God. \n This is exactly the case with Jesus. He clearly claimed all these things and more. If He is God, as He claimed, we must believe in Him, and if He is not, then we should have nothing to do with Him. Jesus is either Lord of all or not Lord at all.\n \n Yes, Jesus claimed to be God. Why should anyone believe it? After all, merely claiming to be something does not make it true. Where's the evidence that Jesus is God?\n \n The Bible gives various reasons, including miracles and fulfilled prophecy, that are intended to convince us that Jesus is the one whom He said He was (John 20:30, 31). The main reason, or the sign which Jesus Himself said would demonstrate that He was the Son of God, was His resurrection from the dead.\n \n When asked for a sign from the religious leaders, Jesus replied, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40, RSV). In another place He said, when asked for a sign, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up . . . but he spake of the temple of his body\" (John 2:19, 21, KJV). The ability to raise His life back from the dead was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone else who has ever lived.\n \n Anyone wishing to refute the case for Christianity must explain away the story of the resurrection. Therefore, according to the Bible, Jesus proves to be the Son of God by coming back from the dead (Romans 1:4). The evidence is overwhelming that Jesus did rise from the grave, and it is this fact that proves Jesus to be God.\n \n And there's much, much more as well besides this.\n \n (This is an excerpt from the book, \"Answers to Tough Questions,\" by Josh McDowell and Don Stewart.) \n \n As for Bootfitter, that squirrel-hunt on Nazareth not existing at the time of Christ is not seriously regarded as being a viable argument in any conservative scholarship circles.",

   "Both Matthew and Luke give the genealogy of Jesus. Unfortunately, the two versions cannot be reconciled. This fact should be obvious to even the casual reader. Christian apologists have attempted to get around this by claiming that, while Matthew's genealogy runs through Joseph, Luke's genealogy actually begins with Mary. There is no justification for the claim that Luke's genealogy of Jesus runs through Mary. Allow me to quote... \n \n Luk 3:23-24 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli, Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which was the son of Melchi...\n \n Luke never even mentions Mary, but he does mention Joseph.

   "i finally read through the review and follow-up commentary of earl doherty's the jesus puzzle. it is said to be the most compelling argument to date that jesus never existed in reality, but was originality a myth and then so personified that eventually it became common belief that the mythical character jesus was an actual historical person\n \n doherty's work revolves almost entirely around the argument that if jesus physically existed, how come nobody wrote about him (except the gospel authors, 4 of which are in the new testament). as strong as this case is made in the book (from what the reviews say), i find it strange that the gospels still exist. a timeline of the new testament authorship puts the writing of mark's gospel at 70 ad. in mark's gospel, it seems obvious that mark was convinced that jesus was a physical person. the hypothetical gospel Q was estimated at around 65 ad. now, these works would have been written/completed within 40 years of the alleged death of jesus (28 ad). it would be quite likely that tidbits of jesus' works and events may have been recorded during his lifetime, but a full biography would not have been compiled until sometime after. we also have to remember that though most great philosophers, whose biographies would have been written during their lifetime lived to old age, jesus died at 33, the bulk of his ministry only taking a duration of 3 years. no great historical figure that would have been recorded would have a biography of their first 3 years of acheivement. this is an extremely short-term legacy\n \n one other thing that doherty seems to not address (again, from what the review says) is the work of paul the apostle, as well as the other apostles that wrote letters to each other when the christian movement had just started. paul's first letter to the thessalonians was dated at around 49 ad, only 20 years after jesus' alleged death. about 6 years after that, he wrote the first epistle to the corithians.\n \n it is no mystery that paul's letter was all themed around jesus' death and resurrection. this is the one unprecedented miraculous event of any \"prophet\" or \"holy man\" in jewish history: self resurrection. raising people from the dead was repeatedly written about in the old testament, as well as the other miracles that jesus did: provision of food, healing of disease, instructing nature, etc. but self resurrection - performing a miracle while dead - is the one work that the entire christian movement is based upon. paul's letters were pregnant with this theme, and that would be understandable looking at the context\n \n the problem with doherty's thesis is that he flippantly mentions that none of the epistles mentioned any of the works of jesus. this is simply not true. there are many events referenced in the epistles that correspond to events described by the gospels. and that is besides the obvious resurrection miracle that is impossible to ignore\n \n - Gal 1:19, the mention of James, the brother of Jesus. James was obviously a physical person, and the book of Galations was written only 20 years after Jesus' death. how could a mythical jesus have a physical brother?\n \n - 1 Cor 11:23-25, last supper, described as in Luke 22: 14-20. at the time of Paul's writing, the church had already made it a custom to commemorate this supper, and paul was only sharing guidelines on it, not introducing it as an original idea\n \n - 1 Cor 15:3-9, a detailed recount of the events surrounding jesus' resurrection, and the coroboration of the idea that jesus had 12 disciples\n \n - Col 1:22, paul explicitly declares that jesus had a body of flesh (i will research this in the concordance)\n \n - Hebrews 5:7, Jesus was flesh, and prayed concerning his death\n \n to me, while these examples are not rampant throughout the epistles, they are there, and suggest clearly that paul and the other letter-wrinting apostles were discussing a physical jesus that they believed died and resurrected\n \n do you have anything from doherty's thesis that addresses this, since the review does not...?",

Thus there was a star resembling a sword, which stood over the city, and a comet, that continued a whole year. Thus also before the Jews' rebellion, and before those commotions which preceded the war, when the people were come in great crowds to the feast of unleavened bread, on the eighth day of the month Xanthicus, [Nisan,] and at the ninth hour of the night, so great a light shone round the altar and the holy house, that it appeared to be bright day time; which lasted for half an hour. This light seemed to be a good sign to the unskillful, but was so interpreted by the sacred scribes, as to portend those events that followed immediately upon it. At the same festival also, a heifer, as she was led by the high priest to be sacrificed, brought forth a lamb in the midst of the temple. Moreover, the eastern gate of the inner [court of the] temple, which was of brass, and vastly heavy, and had been with difficulty shut by twenty men, and rested upon a basis armed with iron, and had bolts fastened very deep into the firm floor, which was there made of one entire stone, was seen to be opened of its own accord about the sixth hour of the night. Now those that kept watch in the temple came hereupon running to the captain of the temple, and told him of it; who then came up thither, and not without great difficulty was able to shut the gate again. This also appeared to the vulgar to be a very happy prodigy, as if God did thereby open them the gate of happiness. But the men of learning understood it, that the security of their holy house was dissolved of its own accord, and that the gate was opened for the advantage of their enemies. So these publicly declared that the signal foreshowed the desolation that was coming upon them. Besides these, a few days after that feast, on the one and twentieth day of the month Artemisius, [Jyar,] a certain prodigious and incredible phenomenon appeared: I suppose the account of it would seem to be a fable, were it not related by those that saw it, and were not the events that followed it of so considerable a nature as to deserve such signals; for, before sun-setting, chariots and troops of soldiers in their armor were seen running about among the clouds, and surrounding of cities.\n \n - see Wars VI.292\n\n The point here is that we are dealing with a pervasively superstitious age.

The fact that, by virtue of your position, you are in a miniscule minority even among nontheistic scholars certainly does not make you wrong, but it does suggest that intellectual humility might be advised.\n\n Perhaps you do not understand my point. I did not essentially say (as you suggested above), \"...there is no basis for entertaining an historical Jesus.\" (But, please, let's not get into a debate over semantics.) In my opening post, I simply asked for anyone who is aware of evidence for an historical Jesus to bring that evidence forth in this thread. Such evidence may exist. I am not aware of any. If such evidence exists, I would like to be aware of it. Period.\n \n You suggest that I have a 'position.' Yet I have no position other than this: I am not aware of any historical evidence for the existence of the Jesus of the Gospels. \n \n Could an individual human being have existed even without there being evidence of that individual's existence today? Sure! Is it reasonable to conclude that a particular human being did, in fact, exist if there is no objective evidence to suggest that this individual existed? (That's not a rhetorical question... that is a question for you to answer if you are so inclined.) \n \n In other words... consider this: It is certainly conceivable that some guy named Simon bar Jonah was born in the year 77 B.C. However, if somebody today claims that Simon bar Jonah was a living, breathing, historical figure in the year 77 B.C., we would need objective evidence in order to verify whether this claim is true. (We could certainly believe the claim on faith without evidence, but we couldn't independently verify the fact without objective evidence.) While I may have no particular reason to doubt that Simon bar Jonah existed, I also have no reason to believe that he did -- unless, of course, objective evidence exists that supports the assertion. \n \n \n...but it does suggest that intellectual humility might be advised.\n\n How can there be more 'intellectual humility' than recognizing that one doesn't know and asking others to share their knowledge?\n \n \nNone of this, by the way, addresses the problem I see with your opening post. \n \n You ask for \"sound historical evidence for the existence of a human Jesus, as described by the Gospels\", thereby conflating the issue of historicity with that of divinity. The approach seems unhelpful. \n\n Regarding your 'problem' with my opening post, I understand your point. Please allow me to clarify my intent. By including the phrase, \"as described by the Gospels,\" I meant to set that particular character apart from any of the other individuals named Jesus at that time. I did not intend for that phrase to be interpreted that any evidence provided must necessarily support the divine nature of Jesus. Does this make more sense now?\n \n Since you have suggested that you lean toward the historicist view of Jesus, I'm curious what leads you to lean this way? Are you aware of any objective evidence that supports this view? If so, as the OP invites, please share it here.",

The same has been said for the Passion Narrative. Given that gThomas and gPeter are viewed, I believe, as being independent of Mark, their existence seems to strengthen the case. I believe Wells, among others, has argued that it seems unlikely that myth accretion alone could account for these traditions in so short a time. \n \n One can certainly weave more than a few scenarios which account for the above, but it seems to me far too reminiscent of the apologist trying desparately to make sense of the death of Judas.

First, while the Antiquities 18.3.3 is widely dismissed as at least a partial interpolation, I doubt you could substantiate a similar consensus with regards to the second reference. So, for example, in Kirby's excellent overview we read:\n \nAlthough Rajak is an exception, most have granted that this passage is substantially authentic for two reasons.\n \n 1. Josephus' emphasis is not on Jesus or James, but on why Ananus was deposed as high priest. As John P. Meier says, \"we have here only a passing, almost blas\u00e9, reference to someone called James, whom Joseph obviously considers a minor character. He is mentioned only because his illegal execution causes Ananus to be deposed.\" (p. 57)\n \n 2. Josephus' account of James being stoned is different from the account given by the church historian Hegesippus c. 170 CE. Meier writes: \"According to Hegesippus, the scribes and Pharisees cast James down from the battlement of the Jerusalem temple. They begin to stone him but are constrained by a priest; finally a laundryman clubs James to death (2.32.12-18). James's martyrdom, says Hegesippus, was followed immediately by Vespasian's siege of Jerusalem (A.D. 70).\" (p. 58) \n \n However, there has been considerable dispute as to whether the phrase \"the brother of Jesus who was called Christ\" was part of the original passage. Wells notes: \"Schurer, Zahn, von Dobschutz and Juster are among the scholars who have regarded the words 'the brother of Jesus, him called Christ' as interpolated.\" (p. 11) To this list, we could add Karl Kautsky, S.G.F. Brandon, Charles Guignebert, and Twelftree.\n \n - see Testimonium Flavianum\n\n Second, your comment that: \"Consider why Origen ... would not point to these references to lend support to his view that Jesus was historical when questioned by 'skeptics' of the time.\" suggests some awareness that such questions were, indeed, posed.

Paul never addresses this in his writings, so it's certainly reasonable to consider that it might not have been an issue to his audience.\n\n actually he does. 1 cor 15:3-8 - For what I received I passed on to you as first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.

Origen produced a response some 60 years later -- even more removed from the time in question.)\n\n the fact that they didnt mention jesus is not evidence that they refuted the claims of the gospel. if there was a religion spreading based on a lie about an innocent man that was crucified, wouldnt those lies be confronted? omitting to mention jesus is not refuting others that did",

Not for the existence of Jesus.\n\n \n Given that Paul existed, and that he did indeed write what he claimed to have wrote, then jesus must have existed as he mentions jesus many many many times. Jesus is the focus of all of pauls writings. Again it is not proof but evidence. Someone who we know existed writes about someone whom he obviously believes existed is evidence of the existence of that one. The are others in history who are only mentioned by some and who wrote nothing themselves, yet we believe that they existed.\n \n For example, King Nebby of Babylon. He wrote nothing himself. But he is written about fairly often. And, the documents we have are copies of copies of copies. We have some archaelogical evidence as well. This only adds to the evidence and essentially proves his existence. For jesus there seems to be little direct archeological evidence but a plethora of documentary evidence.\n \n EF",

The dialogue is about \"Christ\" (with all that the term implies), and not Yeshua. Furthermore, the \"Dialogue\" was written after the first \"Apology\" (153-155 CE) but before 161. This would obviously suggest that he is reprising a discussion held 20 years earlier. How does a transcription of Justin's rendition of a self-serving story of a long past discussion suggest any reason to believe that Trypho/Tarphon said anything close to this? \n \n Or, as Peter Kirby once noted:\"Justin does provide evidence that Jews casted doubt on the idea of Jesus as Messiah and held that Jesus, as one crucified, was accursed. The often-cited line from Justin (you have fashioned a Messiah for yourself) does not indicate that second century Jews had hypothesized the mythical accretion of a Galilean peasant around a heavenly savior god.\"",

There is also figurative litteral which is perfectly acceptable to use figures fo speech.

   "Evidence outside of the new testament:\n \n Tacitus writes:\n \n \"Nero fastened the guilt . . . on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of . . . Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome. \"\n \n Again a reference to suffering an extreme penalty (therefore must be aman) and confirms some of the gospel details, namely reign of tiberius and at the hands of Pilate.\n \n Pliny writes:\n \n \"They were in the habit of meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light, when they sang in alternate verses a hymn to Christ, as to a god, and bound themselves by a solemn oath, not to any wicked deeds, but never to commit any fraud, theft or adultery, never to falsify their word, nor deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up; after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble to partake of food--but food of an ordinary and innocent kind.\"\n \n Please note that he is speaking of christians and he doesn't mention Jesus in particular, but he does mention Christ. This is not some theoretical ideal however because note that he says \"a hymn to christ, AS TO A GOD.\" If he did not think christ to be an actual person then why would he include this last phrase.\n \n Then there is a rather derogatory reference that occurs in the babylonian talmud:\n \n \"On the eve of the Passover Yeshu was hanged. For forty days before the execution took place, a herald . . . cried, 'He is going forth to be stoned because he has practiced sorcery and enticed Israel to apostasy.'\"\n \n Yeshu is the hebrew version of Jesus.\n \n Lucian from around the second century states:\n \n \"The Christians . . . worship a man to this day--the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account. . . . [It] was impressed on them by their original lawgiver that they are all brothers, from the moment that they are converted, and deny the gods of Greece, and worship the crucified sage, and live after his laws.\"\n \n It does not refer to Jesus in particular, but coupled with New testament information we can quite easily deduce that Jesus is who christians worshipped.\n \n More to come.",

   "EF - \n Here is a website (earlier posted on this thread by Easyrider) that outlines several alleged non-biblical references to an historical Jesus. There are probably others than those outlined in that website.\n \n Looking at each one of these references independently, though, a few potential holes begin to appear. While these references cannot simply be brushed aside with a sweep of the hand, none of these references are conclusive. It is generally accepted that some early Christians interpolated texts to include and/or embellish potential references to an historical Jesus. Sorting out authentic versus interpolated references is well beyond my scope as a very amateur student of the issue. I have not read enough of Josephus or Tacitus or Pliny to understand their style. And I have not read enough early Christian interpolations to recognize their modus operandi.\n \n Looking back at my OP, perhaps the most ambiguous aspect of it is the use of the word 'sound.' Afterall, this is really a subjective concept. What can be considered 'sound' evidence? It is likely that there will always be some objection (regardless of how obscure) to any generally accepted historical events. (Afterall, some people believe the moon landing was a hoax!) As with most of history, we are not necessarily going to discover anything 'conclusive.' Rather, we must take what is there... look at it with some perspective... weigh the evidence and see which way the scales lean. \n \n Regarding the issue of an historical Jesus, the evidence that does exist appears to be quite fuzzy. There is nothing that in my opinion could be considered conclusive -- one way or the other. Some individuals put forth a pretty compelling argument one way, but other individuals put forth a compelling argument the other way. There is no theory on the existence of Jesus that has been tested time after time after time and has withstood all tests and all criticisms.\n \n There is no doubt that there are many different opinions on the historicity of Jesus. Here are just a few examples:\n http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/robert_price/fiction.html\n http://www.christianorigins.com/case/\n http://pages.ca.inter.net/~oblio/home.htm\n And this site provides links to several others:\n http://www.christianorigins.com/links.html\n \n \n EF:  \"It does not refer to Jesus in particular, but coupled with New testament information we can quite easily deduce that Jesus is who christians worshipped.\"\n \n I think it is important to note the distinction (as trs alluded to earlier) between Jesus (Yeshua) and Christ.

This census happened to be the first, when Quirinius governed Syria.\"\n \n How can you 'govern' if you are not a governor? Why would someone claim that person X 'governed Syria,' when in fact, person Y was the current governor of Syria? It doesn't make sense. If Quirinius was a consul at the time, why would Luke not have said, \"when Quirinius was a consul in Syria\"? It seems that you have to fabricate a pretty good story to make this particular item of Luke's gospel accurately reflect history.\n \n \"Whether conducted by Quirinius or anyone else, there could not have been a census in Judaea before 6 A.D., since the province had not entered direct Roman control before then. In contrast, we know that such control always entailed a census, because it initiated Roman direct taxation for which the census existed.

   "I guess my question was not clearly communicated. I asked, \"And what historical information about Jesus can we glean from any of Paul's authentic epistles?

Certainly it is possible that this was the same Erastus of which Paul speaks... it may even be probable. But it still doesn't answer the question that I originally asked: \"And what historical information about Jesus can we glean from any of Paul's authentic epistles?\"\n \n Admittedly, I asked two questions, and the second one (\"Is there anything in there that refers to a specific time and place in recorded history?\") did not specifically refer to Jesus.

To say he governed provides the context necessary for Luke's communication.\n\n It sounds to me like one must abandon reason to make this work.

You agreed with me that there was evidence but you now wanted to say that it was flimsy.\n\n No one is asking for proof. You are making that up. I agreed that evidence exists that can be interpreted to form a conclusion that Jesus existed. And yes, the evidence is quite 'flimsy' to use your own word. I'm going to summarize our discussion so far in order to show the progression... see if you agree with my account:\n \n --< I asked for evidence of the actual existence of Jesus (the character described in the gospels) in the history of humanity.\n --< You provided the following statements in post #104: \"Actually, Josephus briefly mentions Jesus. Pliny the younger mentions him. Mostly pliny refers to christians but does reference christ. ... There is a fair amount of documentary evidence for his existence.\"\n --< I respond that the references in Josephus are questionable... agree that Pliny refers to Christians and not to Jesus... and ask you for some of this documentary evidence of which you speak. (All in post #105)\n --< In post #106, you write, \"The death of Paul, who wrote about Jesus extensively (the epistles of paul)\" and also mention that Origen considered Paul's letters to be written by Paul, and \"The same with John and Luke's gospel and the book of acts.\" Then you mention something about the historicity of Pilate.\n --< Of course, Paul never discusses any of the biographical details of the life of Jesus. 'Why' is not the issue... the fact remains that he doesn't. And, as I point out in post #108, the historicity of Pilate is not evidence for the historicity of Jesus.\n --< In post #121, you write, \"Given that Paul existed, and that he did indeed write what he claimed to have wrote, then jesus must have existed as he mentions jesus many many many times. Jesus is the focus of all of pauls writings. Again it is not proof but evidence. ... For jesus there seems to be little direct archeological evidence but a plethora of documentary evidence.\" --< In post #125, I point out that Paul's writings are evidence that Paul believed in a spiritual Jesus Christ whom Paul knew through revelation and through reading the Jewish scripture... not that a physical being named Jesus recently was born in Bethlehem, lived in Nazareth, and was crucified by Romans/Jews in Jerusalem. (And you keep referring to this 'plethora' of documentary evidence, but have thus far only provided one vague reference to something written in Josephus that could potentially be referring to the gospel Jesus, but could just as easily have been a later Christian interpolation in a passage that has obviously been tampered with.\n --< In post #126, I ask you, \"What personal characteristics are you referring to?\" in response to your previous reply to billsco where you state, \"...he would not have identified the person [of Jesus] with personal characteristics.\"\n --< You respond in post #130 with, \"In [Romans] Paul talks about Jesus living and dying. One does not die unless one exists.\" (Ever heard the story of Quetzalcoatl? Did Quetzalcoatl really exist? History is full of savior god-men that 'lived' and 'died.') You continue, \"That is the normal interpretation of those passages. You probably could get allegorical if you wanted but, that would be an abnormal interpretation according to regular interpretation rules.\" (How about that is your interpretation of those passages... some scholars agree with you. Other scholars disagree.)\n --< In post #133, I state, \"Objective evidence does exist that can be pieced together to form a conclusion that a historical Jesus existed.\"\n --< In post #134 you say, \"The great body of evidence supports [the existence of Jesus]. I think I have posted some linguistic studies on other threads about the authenticity of the new testament books. We have more documentary evidence for them than almost any other writing that is in existence.\" (Notice that you keep bringing up the idea of the NT in support of the idea of an historical Jesus.)\n --< In post #136, I disagree that the 'great body of evidence' supports an historical Jesus, but rather \"the evidence... does not lead to a definitive conclusion one way or the other.\"\n --< In post #138, you show a reference to Tacitus and one to Pliny that discuss Christians (and Christus or Christ), but nothing here about Jesus (which you admit). You also provide a 6th Century A.D. reference to the Babylonian Talmud -- which is too far removed from the alleged events to be considered a reliable source. (Here's what Kirby contributes: http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/talmud.html). Finally, you provide a second century quotation from Lucian that provides evidence that Christians existed at that time and that Lucian was familiar with the belief of some Christians that there was an historical individual at the root of the Christian movement. (When did Lucian live again? How would he know whether there was an actual human being named Jesus? Oh yeah... he did only through hearsay.) :)\n --< Also in post #138, you write, \"...coupled with New testament information we can quite easily deduce that Jesus is who christians worshipped.\"\n --< I respond in post #139, \"I think it is important to note the distinction (as trs alluded to earlier) between Jesus (Yeshua) and Christ. Christ is a title meaning 'anointed one.' Yeshua was a common name at the time meaning 'Yahweh saves.' References to Christ are not necesarily references to the gospel Jesus.\" (You are making a big jump by 'easily deducing' that Jesus is who the early Christians worshipped. There is no shortage of other plausible hypotheses.)\n --< In post #149 you respond to a comment by trs, \"I think one simply has to take the logic to the next step. If those people existed and if they were dying such horrible deaths refusing to renounce or worship ceasar or what have you, one might wonder why they would do so for something they just made up. It would be they that made it up after all, not someone centuries before them.\"\n --< In post #152, I suggest that your 'logic' is not necessarily logical. History is full of people that have died for their beliefs... whether those beliefs reflected reality is irrelevant.\n --< In post #157, you provide your list of documents, authors, and dates. (Again, in an attempt to show that the NT is historically reliable.)\n --< In post #164, I suggest you consider \"whether well-preserved ancient texts accurately reflect actual events in the history of humanity.\" (Of course, this is not necessarily the case. Just because something is accurately copied after a certain point in time does not mean that it ALWAYS was copied accurately. And even if it ALWAYS was copied accurately, it does not mean that the text itself is intended to be literal history.)\n --< In post #178, you state, \"The point I am making, logically, is this: If we consider other documents that are far removed from the source and have fewer extant copies for comparison as historically probative, then why do we consider the documents of the bible any less. Or why do we hold them to a higher standard. This seem unreasonable to me. My sources are accurate to within a margin of error as are any source you can locate.\"\n --< trs responded to your comments in post #181. (And of course, when source X states that \"Julius was governor of Province C from this year to that year,\" and there are other sources that confirm this and none that contradict it... it's probably safe to assume its accurate history. When source Y makes many claims that contradict itself [i.e. comparing lineages of Jesus in different gospels]... and makes many claims that contradict other historical knowledge [i.e. Herod's slaughter of the innocents or the Luke vs. Matthew nativity]... and makes many claims that contradict what we know of how the universe operates [i.e. feeding thousands of people with a few loaves of bread or people coming out of their graves and walking around]... then it is certainly reasonable to hold it to a higher standard. For extraordinary claims, there better be some extraordinary evidence. Yet, there is pretty clear evidence that the NT is NOT historically accurate in many cases.

Paul discusses Jesus Christ, whom Paul claims he knew through visions and revelation of reading Jewish scriptures.)",

   "The region was clearly under Rome's control. Just because an official \"governor\" may not have been appointed does not mean that it was not governed.\n\n Did you not read my quotation from Richard Carrier above? Here it is again, \"...there could not have been a census in Judaea before 6 A.D., since the province had not entered direct Roman control before then. In contrast, we know that such control always entailed a census, because it initiated Roman direct taxation for which the census existed. Since Quirinius is the first Roman magistrate to control the province, we expect a census to occur at that time. So we expect a census in 6 A.D., and not before.\" (source) Now, can you show how 'the region was clearly under Rome's control'? Thanks!\n \n \nYou are equivocating title with function.\n\n No. I am simply applying logic to the situation to determine a reasonable conclusion. Luke says that Jesus was born during the census when Quirinius governed Syria. If we take what we know about when the Roman Empire conducted censuses and take what we know about the governorship of Syria, it is certainly reasonable to conclude that the census Luke refers to is the census that took place in A.D. 6, when Quirinius became governor of Syria. Tell me why it is reasonable to conclude anything else?\n \n \nI don't have [Halleys bible Handbook] with me so will need to look up and post the original source.\n\n Please do. It will be interesting to see what it says. (Of course, Carrier's article referenced above already shows that it is extremely unlikely that Quirinius could have been governor twice.)\n \n \nYou give no evidence to deny my claim. I give you a reasonable explanation and then you say \"well he wasn't a 'governor' so you are being unreasonable\". The interpretation is that he governed or ruled or reigned or was in authority over. There is nothing in the record that states that he was in fact the title of \"governor\" only that he was in authority over the region. You would have to take things out of context otherwise. \n\n EF... tell me what your story is. Was Quirinius governor twice? Or was Luke simply referring to a different census and chose to use a consul named Quirinius to identify the census instead of the governor at the time? And if this is the case... is there any evidence of such a census? To me, it seems that you are grasping at straws to make so that Luke is referring to some unknown census other than the census that we know that took place when Quirinius became governor of Syria. And why are you trying to make these claims again??? Oh yeah... it's because if Luke was actually referring to the census when Quirinius was governor of Syria... it would mean that Luke's account conflicts with Matthew's account of the nativity.\n \n You know what? A much more logical explanation is that either Luke or Matthew was mistaken as to WHEN Jesus was born. (This is, of course, assuming that the gospel Jesus actually WAS born.) Hang on, though... we can't actually admit that Luke or Matthew was mistaken, can we? Because then... what else could they be mistaken about? So... no matter how unreasonable it may be, the integrity of Luke and Matthew must be preserved and actual history can be made up to compensate for the discrepancies and conflicts.",

This census happened to be the first, when Quirinius governed Syria.\"\n \n Does it say simply that Quirinius was 'in authority' over something, somewhere in the province of Syria?

   "I note that you say several sources simply aren't reliable.\n\n Just for clarification... I am not suggesting that the sources themselves aren't reliable. For example, Josephus is deemed as a reliable source of historical information. However, his Golden Paragraph (or Testimonium Flavinium) definitely shows evidence of later Christian interpolation; therefore, any of his text referring to Jesus should be considered carefully before coming to any conclusions whether it has been tampered with. There is much debate over the authenticity of the entire Golden Paragraph. There is also scholarly debate over the authenticity of his earlier reference to 'the brother of Jesus, James.' IF these passages are authentic Josephus, then they are evidence that the gospel Jesus existed in reality. \n \n Regarding the other references you supplied, if I recall correctly, all of them are either to 'Christians,' 'Christ,' or Pilate. Or the authors of the statements are so far removed from the actual time of Jesus that they certainly cannot be relating firsthand knowledge. You have not provided any other historical references to the gospel Jesus outside of the two questionable references in the writings of Josephus.\n \n \nHere are the sources you requested.

   "Justin, in Apology 1.34, written about AD 150, and Tertullian, in Against Marcion 4.7,19\n\n Justin Martyr's Apology 1.34 and 1.46 also shows that this was exactly how Christians understood their own history: Quirinius was the first governor of Judaea, and Jesus was born during the census he took there, which happened 150 years earlier. Since Justin wrote his first apology around 155 A.D., this means he believed Jesus was born in 6 A.D. (the 150th year before Justin wrote). He also claims that one can check the census records to confirm this, but this is certainly a bluff: it is extremely unlikely that Justin checked them himself. He does not say he did, and the information he gives is too vague to suggest he was drawing on an official record. Had he read the actual record, he should have been able to report at least one of the items the record would include: for Joseph there would be a full name, age, name of father or family, residence, occupation, and amount of property, as well as the character and extent of any land and the number of slaves owned, and if a baby Jesus would be listed at all in the census records, it would only be as part of this entry. It is also unlikely that just anyone could access such important records--to prevent fraud, they must have been kept under very tight guard and accessible only to Roman magistrates. Cf. Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd ed. (1996), s.v. \"census.\"  (From Carrier's article.)\n \n \n \"...around the turn of the 3rd century, it is believed that Tertullian claimed the Lukan census occurred during the tenure of Gaius Sentius Saturninus (who was governor of Syria from 9 to 6 B.C.).[15.1] Of course, Tertullian is not very reliable,[15.2] and makes this claim in the conext of anti-heretical rhetoric, so he is not to be trusted as an authority on this point.\"\n [15.1] Against Marcion 4.19. \n [15.2] For instance, he claims that Tiberius asked the Senate at Rome to recognize Christianity as an official religion! (Apology 1.5) (Again, from Carrier's article.)\n \n So... here we have two more questionable references.

Remember, Justin Martyr called him 'procurator' in Apology 1:34, which is also covered by this term.] My point is...nothing is really out of order here... \n \n The source, which you will undoubtedly say is biased and not worthy is:\n \n Qurinius Objection\n \n As for the Erastus item, I have to apologize, it did not come from Halley's as I thought but was something I looked up on the APIS website.

Such evidence might give some credence to your position. 'Exerting control' isn't the issue here... We know that when Rome officially annexed an independent kingdom, a census took place.

   "Because, in 8 B.C., Juddah was a seperate kingdom from Rome. Ceasar Augustus would not have the authority to order a census in Juddah anymore that George Bush has the authority to order a census in Britian for taxation purposes.\nThat is patently absurd. \n \nHerod fled to Egypt and from there to Rome. There the Roman Senate, at the recommendation of Antony, proclaimed him king over the land of the Jews, but Herod had to defeat Antigonus before he could retake the government.\n \n Herod came to Syria, where the Roman proconsul in Damascus provided him with a large army. Marching through the Galilee he faced stiff resistance from the population, who hated him bitterly from his early daays as governor there.\n \n - History of the Jewish People; the Second Temple Period (pg. 128)\n\n And ...\n \nRoman influence in the near eastern provinces of Judaea and Syria Palaestina first came to major fruition with the conquests of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey the Great). In 64 BC, the Jews had maintained nearly 2 centuries of independent rule from various eastern nations, but internal struggles and succession issues after the death of King Alexander Jannaeus threatened the stability. His sons, Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, as well as other political and religious factions, all vied for the Judean crown, and they eventually sought mediation from the great Roman conqueror Pompey.\n \n Pompey endorsed Hyrcanus, but Aristobulus and his followers bided their time to resist the decision. While Pompey was busy in a minor campaign against the Arabic Nabataeans, Aristobulus seized Jerusalem and Rome was forced to do more than mediate. Pompey besieged the ancient city and within 3 months, officially made Hyrcanus the high priest and established Judaea as a client state. Despite this, Judaea remained independent of Roman authority provided they stayed within the rules of their status, and some degree of instability beleaguered the state for some time.\n \n Some 2 decades later, Julius Caesar arrived in Judaea while on campaign in the east in 47 BC. The Jews were granted various benefits owing to the uniqueness of their monotheistic religion and Hyrcanus was officially made the King or Ethnarch. Antipater Idumean was granted the first Roman title of the area, being appointed as procurator. It was his responsibility to see to the day to day management of Roman interests and provincial oversight. However, Antipater was assassinated soon after, and his son, the soon to be famous Herod, took his place. Shortly thereafter, Parthian invasions from Syria set up Aristobolus II on the throne, but Herod shrewdly garnered the intervention of the Roman Senate was confirmed as Ethnarch in 37 BC. Later, Marcus Antonius who was given command of the entire eastern empire in an agreement with Octavian (the future Augustus), bequeathed the province along with other Roman possessions to Cleopatra in Egypt. While Herod remained in a position of authority in this period, he supported Antonius and Cleopatra, understandably so, but with Octavian's victory in the civil war at Actium in 31 BC, the situation changed irrevocably for the entire Roman world.\n \n Herod went to Rhodes to meet the victorious Octavian, and through his political skill, and likely proven ability to stabilize the province, continued in his confirmation as ruler of Judaea. Herod was a brutal king, but this brutality helped keep an often instable political and religious environment on peaceful terms. Despite his brutality and apparent disinterest in traditional Jewish customs, Herod was careful not to infringe on these traditions for the people. He found it vital to his own survival to seek the approval of the masses, but the overwhelming reason for his success was the administration of force to suppress open opposition. The Jews, however, were limited self-rule as it related to their religious practices. The Sanhedrin was established under Herod as a sort of religious council to oversee the affairs of faith and religious law.\n \n - see Judaea - Palaestina\nYour \"Juddah was a seperate kingdom from Rome\" is an ignorant fiction.\n \n \nIn addition, the census that was mentioned at around that time period was for ROMAN citizens only. THe people of Juddah were not Roman citizens.\nBut you've done no more here than reassert (without any apparent basis) the statement being challenged. You may be correct, but you've certainly done little to support such a supposition, while your Bush/Britain analogy seems comically off-base - unless you can show that Tony Blair came to power with the aid of the US Cavalry.",

   "In support of trebor and thebootfitter, it is interesting to read Carrier's 2001 comments on Quirinius and the census. It includes the following ...\n \nWhether conducted by Quirinius or anyone else, there could not have been a census in Judaea before 6 A.D., since the province had not entered direct Roman control before then. In contrast, we know that such control always entailed a census, because it initiated Roman direct taxation for which the census existed. Since Quirinius is the first Roman magistrate to control the province, we expect a census to occur at that time. So we expect a census in 6 A.D., and not before. This is due to the nature of Roman imperialism. The whole point of a client kingdom, as Judaea was in the time of Herod, was that the kingdom retain its independence while paying a set and agreed annual tribute--many territories received this special status for cooperating with Rome in important wars, or when Rome did not want to trouble itself with running the province directly, and typically these client states surrounded and protected the borders of the Empire, providing a kind of buffer zone against invasions.\n \n To conduct a census in contravention of such an alliance would have been a notable event indeed, mentioned in many other places as the peculiar event that it would have been--even if it did not start an outright war, as almost happened when the Romans finally did conduct a census in Judaea, once they were in direct control. Why, after all, would Rome want a census of a territory it was not taxing directly? Such a thing was never done at any time in the history of Rome. Horst Braunert's study of the subject \"disproves conclusively the notion of a Roman census before the creation of the province\" while also demonstrating that a census was \"a necessary consequence of the establishment of direct provincial government.\"[9.3] And as we saw above, Josephus confirms a census at the beginning of Quirinius' reign, just when we would expect it.\n \n - see The Date of the Nativity in Luke (4th ed., 2001)\nThe reference is to:[9.3] A.N. Sherwin-White, \"Quirinius: a Note\" (op. cit. 5.2, 1963, p. 167), on Horst Braunert's study \"Der r\u00f6mische Provinzialzensus und der Sch\u00e4tzungsbericht des Lukas-Evangeliums,\" Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr alte Geschichte 6 (1957), pp. 192-214.I would love to find an English translation of that study.",
