   "I personally spoke with the soldiers who were manning that checkpoint including the ones who shot. The car flew past the stop signs and barbed wire that was placed out, they put a light on the car and it still continued at them, they fired warning shots, the car sped up at them, they shot to kill. That area was hit by 4 VBIED(Vehicle Born Improvised Explosive Devices{carbomb}) in the week leading up to that incedent. They are going to try to get these guys for murder now of the Italian agent/driver. Anyone else here about that?",
