What you're doing is giving all laws equal status, but there are two different kinds of \"laws\". There are laws enacted in a constitutional way, and then there are laws that resulted from PAST judicial activism. Many conservative judges of today are afraid to rock the boat, by making rulings that would call attention to past judicial activism.

In a series of decisions in Florida state courts, Circuit Judge George Greer and his colleagues have chosen to credit the claim of \n Michael Schiavo that his wife long ago expressed a well-considered wish to be killed if she found herself in a disabled state. Of course, there is no reason to believe she ever seriously considered she might find herself in such a state. They have chosen to deny efforts by Terri Schiavo's mother and father to assume responsibility for their daughter's care. They have chosen to strike down legislation passed by the Florida legislature, and signed by the governor, to permit the governor to allow water and nutrition to be given to patients who leave no written directive, and to allow some recourse for family members who wish to challenge the withholding of nutrition and hydration. \n\n \n Greer is probably not as bad as others - I'd say he tends to go with the flow more than do the right thing, if it means rocking the boat.\n \n There's your answer, even though you answered my questions with a question that was largely unrelated to mine.

This wasn't new to the legislature or the Courts. Similar laws have been made many times in the past. The Florida District Court simply did not follow the instructions given to it by the Legislature.

Chief Justice Roger Taney overruled congres's power to ban slavery in the territories and imposed his own view on the nation.\n \n Current federal judge Michael McConnell, on Dred Scott, \"When a strict interpretation of the constitution, according to the FIXED rules which govern the interpretation of laws, is abandoned, and the theoretical opinions of individuals are allowed to control it's meaning, we no longer have a constitution, we are under the government of individual men, who for the time being have power to declare what the constitution is according to their own views of what it ought to mean.\"\n \n This has happened slowly happened over time. Starting in the 60's, activist judges have managed to convince liberals that they have a \"right to privacy\", including the right to do things like have abortions and do drugs. The problem is, a completely unfettered right to privacy isn't in the constitution, because the framers knew that crimes can be committed in private.\n \n \n \n \nSo if the majority passed a law that was in every way unconstutional, you would be aganist the judiciary ruling aganist it? Why was it that you now change your position radically? \n\n \n You don't know what your own positions are, let alone mine.",

Where's the dichotomy?\n Let me attempt to explain how I see the Dred Scott Decision. The Court ruled that Dred Scott wasn't a free man simply because his master brought him to a free state. I agree with that decision from a legal standpoint. Slaves weren't considered part of the \"people of the United States\" at the time, so giving a slave that status would have been judicial activism. \n Now, what should have followed and did, was a political movement to end slavery, not a judicial decree. If the Court had granted Scott full citizenship, it would have, effectively undermined the very document that it was sworn to uphold. This is a good example of how the process should be done. Congress makes laws; Courts determine the constitutionality of them; they don't rewrite them.",
