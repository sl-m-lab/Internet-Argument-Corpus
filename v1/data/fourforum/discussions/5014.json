Okay, I'm cheating with an eleventh catajory:\n \n Most amazing scene change in movie history: 2001 (its a bone......... no its a spaceship!) :p\n\n \n \n The race scene in the French Connection was pretty good too........",

   "My Favorite movies, in no particular order:\n The Shawshank Redmption\n Forrest Gump\n The Lord of the Rings Trilogy\n High Fidelity\n Radio Flyer\n Keeping the Faith\n Crimson Tide\n Stand By Me\n Ordinary People\n The Sandlot\n Airplane\n Monty Python and the Holy Grail\n Shaun of the Dead\n The Boondock Saints\n \n \nMy Best List\n Worst Movies of all Time\n \n Pearl Harbor - \"OK, so I'm like seeing this guy and then Oh My GOD!!! The harbor gets like bombed and I'm like...wow...\" I would rather eat dryer lint than watch this film\n\n LMAO!\n I would definitely include that on my list as well. Have you seen Team America: World Police? They do a hilarious song about that movie in it.\n \n As far as worst movies, that's harder. I tend to forget about the bad ones. But from what I can remember at the moment I'd say:\n G.I. Jane- One of the few movies in my life I've actually walked out on.\n The English Patient- Easily the single most boring movie I've ever seen in my life. I wish I could be more clever about this, but that would have required the film to give me some material to work with.\n Saw II- Screw plot! Lets just smash people's heads!",

Horrifying. Beautiful.\n Being John Malkovich - Just so weird that I have to love it.\n A Clockwork Orange - Needs no explanation.\n Casino - much better than Scarface\n Ong Bak - best martial arts since Bruce Lee\n \n Plus all De Niro's films; finest actor of his generation.\n \n And just for the hell of it, the definitive worst: Kangaroo Jack.
