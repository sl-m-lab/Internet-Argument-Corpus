I believe people serving prison sentences are (in some states) deprived of their right to vote in elections etc.\n \n It's a difficult question in a democracy because we associate the deprivation of rights with totalitarian states:we uphold certain democratic/humanitarian values under the rule of law - so we are reluctant to deprive even the most vicious criminal of certain rights (such as the right to a fair trial).\n \n I know this is a pretty feeble answer because I'm saying that we would have to give even Bin Laden the chance to defend himself in court if ever he were arrested.

   "I would have to say \"it depends\"\n \n While felons certainly loose some rights (such as the right to practice medicine or vote an most states), stripping them of all rights wouldcertainly seem to fall under \"cruel and unusual\".\n \n Are you talking about while they are in prison? If that is the case, I think it should depend largely on their crime. They should certainly never loose access to the courts. I think they should be allowed their freedom of seach and religion as well, since they don't cost us anything.\n \n As far as te others, such as cable TV, Ice cram, etc... These are not rights, and we do not give them to felons becuase we somehow percive them to be rights. We give them these things becuase in the united states, we have now incarcerated enough of our population that it would be incredibly expensive not to provide these things. Sure, we spend some money to provide them cable tv and things to do, but we also save a fortune. By making prison bearable, we decrease the security requirement. If you rn your prison like a gulag, you have to have a massive commitment of armed manpower int he form of guards to keep your prisoners under control. As is, US prisons have a rediculously low number of guards per prisoner. They could not possibly keep order if the prsoiners chose to revolt (as several prison riots in the 70's proved). \n \n Countries that have adopted draconian measures in regards to their prison populations have also found another drawback to this approch. Your prisons turn into little factories that turn out revolutionaries. IF you keep your penalties reasonable, people do the crime, do the time, and then theoretically try to keep on the right track in order to keep from being punished again. If you take peopole and brutalise them for 5 or 10 years and then release them, their impulse is not to try to work in the system to avoid ebing punished again, their impulse seems to be to strike at the system.",

   "This is my first post though I've found many interesting discussions in this forum. I will reply on this because, unfortunately I am experienced in this subject. I am a felon. I was convicted in 1978 for drug violations and a burglary. That burglary was in the commission to obtain drugs (drug store). Luckily I was one of the few and I got my act together. I learned a trade while I served my time in a maximum security facility. I went \"out into the world\" and applied what I learned and am now a hard working, law abiding (well, more or less...lol) citizen. I can vote, but not run for office. I have gone to court to have my right to own long guns reinstated, though I can not, nor do I wish, to own (or possess) a handgun. But a point I'd like to make here. Not all people that commit crimes are really bad people, I made some bad mistakes and I learned from that. People can be rehabilitated if given the chance. Money should be spent on training people in trades or schooling so they don't end up back in the system. Everyone loses then, the tax payer's money is spent (again), the predicate felon is now going to serve more time, the felon's family suffers immeasurably. Training and educating is a cost saving that should be kept up. Oh by the way, my family paid for my college while I was away. We followed the same tuition assistance guidelines as those on the street. One big problem is that once you're a felon, you're always a felon. If you go for a job you must admit that you've been convicted of a felony. My screw up was almost 30 years ago. Luckily I've been in the same place of employment for 20 of those years. Back when I started, I didn't have to fill out that application. But what should I do if I lose my job (which due to outsourcing I almost did, twice)? Should I lie and take my chances? Should I throw myself to the mercy or a human resources department and cry pity? How long does one have to serve a sentence? I am sorry, I did my time, I paid my dues, I should be able to go to the courts and get my record cleared, should I not? I'm so afraid to take my children to another country due to the fears of being turned away as a common criminal.",

   "This is my first post though I've found many interesting discussions in this forum. I will reply on this because, unfortunately I am experienced in this subject. I am a felon. I was convicted in 1978 for drug violations and a burglary. That burglary was in the commission to obtain drugs (drug store). Luckily I was one of the few and I got my act together. I learned a trade while I served my time in a maximum security facility. I went \"out into the world\" and applied what I learned and am now a hard working, law abiding (well, more or less...lol) citizen. I can vote, but not run for office. I have gone to court to have my right to own long guns reinstated, though I can not, nor do I wish, to own (or possess) a handgun. But a point I'd like to make here. Not all people that commit crimes are really bad people, I made some bad mistakes and I learned from that. People can be rehabilitated if given the chance. Money should be spent on training people in trades or schooling so they don't end up back in the system. Everyone loses then, the tax payer's money is spent (again), the predicate felon is now going to serve more time, the felon's family suffers immeasurably. Training and educating is a cost saving that should be kept up. Oh by the way, my family paid for my college while I was away. We followed the same tuition assistance guidelines as those on the street. One big problem is that once you're a felon, you're always a felon. If you go for a job you must admit that you've been convicted of a felony. My screw up was almost 30 years ago. Luckily I've been in the same place of employment for 20 of those years. Back when I started, I didn't have to fill out that application. But what should I do if I lose my job (which due to outsourcing I almost did, twice)? Should I lie and take my chances? Should I throw myself to the mercy or a human resources department and cry pity? How long does one have to serve a sentence? I am sorry, I did my time, I paid my dues, I should be able to go to the courts and get my record cleared, should I not? I'm so afraid to take my children to another country due to the fears of being turned away as a common criminal.\n\n \n Dear dduck, You said what your crime was, but that is besides the point. Any man or woman who \"pays their dues\" completes their sentence posed by the court system MUST be given a clean slate when finished, (but they are not). When we do not give felons a new slate then they are given a life sentence, regardless of crime. Citizen do not have the right to \"judge\" you for the rest of your life, the court system only has that right. If our court system deems you are fit for society, no one else should be allowed to know your past history. PERIOD. Its a violation of your privacy.\n \n Unfortunately, the court system takes crime as a joke. They let out people before their time. Murderers are let out to kill again, rapist are let out to rape again, child molesters are let out to molest again, and society is fed up with it and sick and tired of it. In this society every person in almost every profession is liable for their own actions, we need to be able to sue judges, and parole boards who let out convicts who are a known danger to society and yet let them out to harm again.\n \n As for you. I will not judge you for your past, nor do I believe you have to state your past once you done your time. Any felon let out of prison or jail, should be allowed to vote and even run for office. You pay taxes don't you? You're an american citizen aren't you? There are many laws on the books that are unconstitutional, but never contested by anyone, because fighting the system takes thousands and thousands of dollars and years of ones life to make change.",

   "Thank you for the nice response Caprii. One thing alot of people don't know and will probably like to hear is that their is also what we called con-justice. Any kiddie rapist was dealt with accordingly if they were in general population. If they were in PC (protective custody) they spent 23 hours in a cell and 1 hour in a dog cage for exercise (no matter what the weather was like). I have seen things that would curddle the blood of the hardest men, that is what made me learn my lesson. Yes, I made mistakes, lots of them, but I think I have paid my dues. Good thing I met my wife, she opened my eyes to another life. \n Yes sinjin, I can get a passport. I used to travel alot on business but I refused to go overseas for fear of 'getting caught' and having to face my employer for an explanation. Now I no longer travel due to a terminally ill wife. I did call to see if I could get a passport and their were no restrictions on that other than if I was on parole at the time.",

   "It boggles the mind why people like Duo and the rest of the left are so concerned about the rights of the felons and have no concern about the rights of the victims...........\n\n \n No they just see a bigger picture than you do. Nobody says hey let's reward the rapist or drug dealer or white collar criminal. If convicted they have thier lives turned upside down. Is it an eye for an eye, sometimes yes sometimes no. Could we have a better system to help victims of crime, absolutly. The question is what do we as a society do with someone that has been put into a prison environment for 1 or 5 or 20 years? I think we can agree that life inside is drastically different than life outside. To commit a crime that warrants jail time the potential benefit of the crime has more value than the potential repercusions. So now we have someone who has even less ability to fit into society. What are the odds of when that choice is made again the person will consider the repercusions? Based on results not very good. \n \n Society needs rules in order to flourish and maintain stability. There must be a system in place to address those who would venture outside the boundaries of those rules for the benefit of all. There must also be a system to prevent 2nd, 3rd, 5th time offenders. You can view rehabilitation programs as criminals being rewarded, but would you not feel safer knowing that the guy who spent 20 years in prison for murdercould have something of value on the outside that keeps him from killing someone else? I think of that more as an investment in a society.",

   "Hello guys, I am currently going thru a legal issue in the state of politically acclaimed California. It has been brought to my attention in reading your posts that none of you have once addressed the issue of the many times stated, \"I didn't do it!\" What if the person didn't really do it, what if indeed they were in the wrong place at the wrong time? What do we tell them? \"Oh well, you shouldn't have gone there, too bad mac, better judgment should be used next time.\" Is this the answer we give these \"victims of circumstance\"? Because remember, yes, they are victims. And just like me, I came home to my place of comfort and residence and was caught up in a situation that should have never happened. But, I never once thought to myself that, \"Hmmm, I wonder if it's safe to go to my place of solitude. I wonder if there are any circumstances that I don't know about that may impact my life forever.\" No, I didn't think of these things, who does? Do you? No, because you automatically assume that your house will be under the same pretenses of existence that you acheived when you left it. So, why would you suspect anything? Why would that cross your mind? So should felons have rights? Maybe. Should they be screened to give them an opportunity to qualify for certain rights? Definately. If a man has a felony speeding ticket, he has endagered others' safety and well being. Should we also charge him with 7500 counts of attempted murder? No, because attempted murder is commited with the intention to cause bodily harm. Now, this man may have been late to work, or his wife may have been in the hospital injured, or his dog may have started a fire somehow in his house. He may have an injury or something going on and trying to get to the hospital. 'He could have called 911 you say' Well, what if it happened while he was already driving? The point I make people is that yes some rights should be taken away from a felon who has murdered someone or who has raped someone, especially if they did it more than once. But, it should be a case-by-case basis on what they loose and who does. The speeding man shouldn't loose his right to vote because he had an emergency or because his wife was in labor. If the cop who pulls him over gives him a felony ticket and he is brought up on the charges and convicted, should we treat him like Charles Manson? Should he loose his rights to his children because he was in a hurry? No!!! Definately not!! and if a man/woman is caught in a situation they have no control over and were 'innocently charged' and convicted. It should be made known. We all know that the system isn't perfect and that, just as in every other aspect of our life, there are people who take advantage of some situations for self gain. So in all these facts, we should come to conclusions that all felons who have served their time and proven a valliant recovery, should be treated as a Citizen of This Great Country!! My answer in short: Screen them, find the whys whens and wheres before you automatically assume they are Charles Manson! What if they were to tell you that it was actually another person who did it and they could prove it.... would you listen then? How would you repay them? You can't!!! They have lost all forever!! There is no repayment for actually being innocent! And the victims never loose thier rights, they never loose the right to vote, or own a gun. These statements made to these effects are not tangible and are completely symantical. Plus they violate the rules of answering the question to subject. Yes I said violate, because every time we deny someone something who divinely by right deserves it, then we have committed a crime against them. So now we are the criminals and no one ever wants to accept that as a truth because when we put it upon ourselves to judge someone we have committed a crime against ourselves, that person, and God.",
