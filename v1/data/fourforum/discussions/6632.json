   "Hmm, interesting. I would like to think that it was not Americas fault that these people didn't have a chance to vote, and In fact I'd say it be more the fault of the new Iraqi government. There are, of course, several possibilities as to why there were no polling stations in these areas.\n \n It is possible that Iraqi/US forces never managed to pave the way for the elections, and the areas that did not get polling stations were in fact still in Insurgent hands. If this was the case, then Iraqi/US officials trying to set up a polling station may very well be shot, and that may discourage them from entering the area in the first place. Given the insurgents displayed dislike of democracy, I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case.\n \n \nIn Ramadi, a group of residents said they had walked around their neighborhood looking for a voting center and not found one. Parts of Ramadi are essentially in rebel hands.\n\n \n Here the article says that parts of Ramadi are still under terrorist controll. Also it says that the group of residence only looked in their neiborhood, and if that neighborhood was under Insurgent controll, then they probably won't find one.",
