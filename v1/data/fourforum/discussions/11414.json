   "I am challenging Jo to a one on one debate about \"How the bible views Homosexuality\" for a couple of reasons. One to see real evidence one way or the other regarding whether or not the bible really condemns homosexuality, or if that is just a homophobic interpretation. Since Jo also claims to be religious, at least he wont attempt to question the legitimacy of the bible itself but this will be a debate about the accuracy of our interpretations. I base this challenge on these statement by Jo.\n \n \nJo Bennett] \n You do exactly the same thing, you frequently talk about \"gay apologist websites\" with reference to translations of the Bible that son't condone your homophobia.\n\n \n \n \n You attack the sources because you don't like the conclusions. You are unable to refute the conclusions themselves so you dismiss the source itself. That is precisely what you accuse Penfold of doing. Also, your conflation of Jewish and Israeli is noted.\n \n Who are you to judge how the Bible was intended to be interpreted?\n\n \n \n Jo Bennett \n You really need to learn the difference between presenting an alternative explanation and proving that it is the correct one. You have done the former but not the latter.\n \n The parallel in this situation is apt because while it may not be possible to directly disprove the claims made by IRIS, the fact that they are a pro-Israel lobby group with a vested interest in demonising arabs does undermine them as a reliable source. You don't accept a pro-gay source, Penfold won't accept a pro-Israel source.\n\n \n And I will start by posting all of the verses in the bible referring to same gender sex.\n \n Taken from the HOLY BIBLE: NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION (C) 1978 by the New \n York Bible Society, used by permission of Zondervan Bible Publishers.\n \n GEN 19:1 The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was \n sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet \n them and bowed down with his face to the ground.\n \n 2 \"My lords,\" he said, \"please turn aside to your servant's house. You can \n wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the \n morning.\" \"No,\" they answered, \"we will spend the night in the square.\"\n \n 3 But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his \n house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they \n ate.\n \n 4 Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of \n Sodom--both young and old--surrounded the house.\n \n 5 They called to Lot, \"Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring \n them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\"\n \n 6 Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him\n \n 7 and said, \"No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing.\n \n 8 Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring \n them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do \n anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.\"\n \n 9 \"Get out of our way,\" they replied. And they said, \"This fellow came \n here as an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse \n than them.\" They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break \n down the door.\n \n 10 But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and \n shut the door.\n \n 11 Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and \n old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.\n \n 12 The two men said to Lot, \"Do you have anyone else here--sons-in-law, \n sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them \n out of here,\n \n 13 because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD \n against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.\"\n \n ============================================\n \n LEV 18:22 \"'Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is \n detestable.\n \n 29 \"'Everyone who does any of these detestable things--such persons must \n be cut off from their people.\n \n 20:13 \"'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them \n have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will \n be on their own heads.\n \n ================================================\n \n ROM 1:26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their \n women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.\n \n 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and \n were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with \n other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\n \n 32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things \n deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also \n approve of those who practice them.\n \n ===============================================\n \n 1CO 6:9 Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of \n God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor \n adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders\n \n 10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers \n will inherit the kingdom of God.\n \n 11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were \n sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by \n the Spirit of our God.\n \n =============================================\n \n 1TI 1:8 We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.\n \n 9 We also know that law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers \n and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious; for those \n who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,\n \n 10 for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars and perjurers-\n -and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine\n ",

And do you believe that Religious Tolerance is a legitimate, objective, theological christian source for studying the bible? Of course you believe that, don't you. Just read the first paragraph of their statement of belief and you can clearly see the company you are keeping. But what is so incredibly sad about you is that you can't even see what's wrong with accepting such sources as valid or reliable.\n \n As to his other link, it was a valid christian source. But in typical fashion, when iangb saw that he was defeated in dealing with homosexuality, he attempted to change the subject to drunkenness which has nothing at all to do with this debate, even though his argument there was false also, I saw no reason to go off topic and call him on it.\n \n But ask yourself this Jo; of what value is a source if when starting out with any deliberation regarding the interpretation of scriptures, there first consideration is satisfying the various belief systems mentioned below? Can you imagine a more watered down source for the truth Jo? Probably not, but that spiritual blindness is ultimately your problem, not mine.\n OCRT Statement of Belief:\n \n We are a multi-faith group. As of 2008-FEB, we consist of one Atheist, Agnostic, Christian, Wiccan and Zen Buddhist. Thus, the OCRT staff lack agreement on almost all theological matters, such as belief in a supreme being, the nature of God, interpretation of the Bible and other holy texts, whether life after death exists, what form the afterlife may take, etc.\n You may choose to respect this as a source Jo, but you only reveal that you haven't a clue regarding Gods truth in any way if you do. So mock me if you will, but I have the assurance and knowledge that I am ultimately right in trusting God and not compromising His truth in order to satisfy sinful and fallen men.",

   "To me, the guys at religious tolerance give the impression of trying to find truth, rather than deciding what truth is and assuming that the evidence fits. Translating the Bible is a matter of scholarship, understanding of langugage, culture and context, not a matter of belief. If you look at their site, they present a variety of opinions, for the most part they are aiming to describe, which is why they refer to a number of sources in their article about homosexuality in the Bible.\n \n In any case, this is beside the point, because as you have just demonstrated once again, you are attacking the source of the argument, not the argument itself.\n \n As for my beliefs on Corinthians, I don't believe that it is infallible. God is infalliable, Paul is not. The Word of God is not the Bible, the Word is Jesus Christ, the Living Word. He is revealed through the Bible, but that does not make the Bible infallible; just as in earlier times God was revealed through the patriarchs and prophets, even though they were likewise fallible, and as Jesus continues to be revealed to us in the lives of the saints and heroes of the church.",

But remember this, archie. You have absolutely no way of knowing what anything you just said there is true. The bible was meant as a recorded history of the Jewish race, however it had been passed down generation after generation through word of mouth, so things got a little twisted. Like god guiding moses on his boat through the red sea may have become \"Moses struck his staff into the red sea and through God's power the red sea parted!\". So King David (I think that was the one) ordered the history of the jewish race to be written down, so it wouldn't be twisted anymore.\n \n At least thats what you learn when you take courses on bible study.",

Are you actually arguing that these verses are ambiguous in any way?LEV 18:22 \"'Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is \n detestable.\n \n 29 \"'Everyone who does any of these detestable things--such persons must \n be cut off from their people.\n \n 20:13 \"'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them \n have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will \n be on their own heads.\n \n ================================================\n \n ROM 1:26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their \n women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.\n \n 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and \n were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with \n other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\n \n 32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things \n deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also \n approve of those who practice them.\n \n ===============================================\n \n 1CO 6:9 Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of \n God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor \n adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders\n \n 10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers \n will inherit the kingdom of God.\n \n 11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were \n sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by \n the Spirit of our God.\n \n =============================================\n \n 1TI 1:8 We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.\n \n 9 We also know that law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers \n and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious; for those \n who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,\n \n 10 for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars and perjurers-\n -and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine\n\n \n \n If those bible quotes are true, then so are these:\n \n Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.\n &#8212; 1 Samuel 15:3\n \n The next day, when Pashhur finally released him, Jeremiah said, \"Pashhur, the LORD has changed your name. From now on you are to be called 'The Man Who Lives in Terror.' For this is what the LORD says: I will send terror upon you and all your friends, and you will watch as they are slaughtered by the swords of the enemy. I will hand the people of Judah over to the king of Babylon. He will take them captive to Babylon or run them through with the sword. And I will let your enemies plunder Jerusalem. All the famed treasures of the city &#8211; the precious jewels and gold and silver of your kings &#8211; will be carried off to Babylon. As for you, Pashhur, you and all your household will go as captives to Babylon. There you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you promised that everything would be all right.\" (Jeremiah 20:3-6 NLT)\n \n \n \n \n So they sent twelve thousand warriors to Jabesh-gilead with orders to kill everyone there, including women and children. \"This is what you are to do,\" they said. \"Completely destroy all the males and every woman who is not a virgin.\" Among the residents of Jabesh-gilead they found four hundred young virgins who had never slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.\n \n \n \n The Israelite assembly sent a peace delegation to the little remnant of Benjamin who were living at the rock of Rimmon. Then the men of Benjamin returned to their homes, and the four hundred women of Jabesh-gilead who were spared were given to them as wives. But there were not enough women for all of them. The people felt sorry for Benjamin because the LORD had left this gap in the tribes of Israel. So the Israelite leaders asked, \"How can we find wives for the few who remain, since all the women of the tribe of Benjamin are dead? There must be heirs for the survivors so that an entire tribe of Israel will not be lost forever. But we cannot give them our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn oath that anyone who does this will fall under God's curse.\"\n \n \n \n Then they thought of the annual festival of the LORD held in Shiloh, between Lebonah and Bethel, along the east side of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem. They told the men of Benjamin who still needed wives, \"Go and hide in the vineyards. When the women of Shiloh come out for their dances, rush out from the vineyards, and each of you can take one of them home to be your wife! And when their fathers and brothers come to us in protest, we will tell them, 'Please be understanding. Let them have your daughters, for we didn't find enough wives for them when we destroyed Jabesh-gilead. And you are not guilty of breaking the vow since you did not give your daughters in marriage to them.'\" So the men of Benjamin did as they were told. They kidnapped the women who took part in the celebration and carried them off to the land of their own inheritance. Then they rebuilt their towns and lived in them. So the assembly of Israel departed by tribes and families, and they returned to their own homes.\n \n (Judges 21:10-24 NLT)\n \n \n \n \n \n If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father. Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.\n \n \n (Deuteronomy 22:28-29 NLT)\n \n \n And lets not forget about good Ole God telling us to kill rape victims:\n \n \n \n If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife.\n (Deuteronomy 22:23-24 NAB)\n \n \n So, of course, you know that from these quotes that God condones murder and rape. Anyone who denies that simply cannot \"read English\". \n \n \n \nSo what you're saying is that you couldn't respond rationally to my answer which directly answered your question, so you just changed the subject and blurted out \"Slavery, anyone\"?\n\n \n It was completely relevant, and just because you cannot refute my argument doesn't mean that you should accuse me of changing the subject.\n \n \nThis is why I detest debating with ignorant people and children, and in your case I'm dealing with both.\n\n \n I am not ignorant nor a child.\n \n Can't refute the argument? Belittle your opponent.\n \n \n \n \nStop lying again shooter.\n\n \n Funny that you never give any proof about how I lie, you simply state it so.\n \n \nYou already started the thread about the gay gene and were swiftly obliterated.\n\n \n By you and what army?\n \n \nSo don't even try to assert that they were born homosexual.\n\n \n So someone chooses whether or not to be gay? Who would choose to be gay in the first place, especially with the likes of you and your ilk running around?\n \n \nAnd my answer was clear that homosexuals can be saved just as straights can.\n\n \n So are homosexuals at a disadvantage compared to heterosexuals?\n \n \nWhy do you insist on distorting the truth?\n\n \n An \"archie truth\" and the real truth are quite different in most cases. Many posters would agree with me on this.\n \n \nDo you hate it that much at your virgin age?\n\n \n Cannot refute your opponents argument? Pull the age card. How immature.\n \n \n \n \nWhy am I not surprised that the deepest statement you could come up with is a quote from someone else.\n\n \n So quotes are always invalid, especially when they come from someone much smarter than both you and I?\n \n \nIt's just too bad that you look up to atheists and secular humanists for your knowledge.\n\n \n I look up to intellectuals, atheists and humanists because even though I don't agree with everything they say, they have basic logic and knowledge skills. They are usually highly intelligent, and don't force their moral code on others. They are much more mentally mature that people who cling to a religion for comfort.\n \n \n \nWhat a pathetic waste it will be.\n\n \n We'll see about that, won't we archie? You're in for quite a rude awakening.",

It is him who ignores my responses while changing the subject when he can't refute my arguments. But why am I not surprised that you would pipe in with your half cent. I say half cent because that's all your opinion is worth.\n \n \nThere are plenty of sages at 20 just as there are imbeciles at 60.\n\n \n Plenty of 20 year old sages? Can you name just a few?

You not only twist and corrupt the bibles true meaning but you ignore those posts that are too difficult to deal with. You keep repeating the same tired and flawed lies of the pro homosexual community while denying the simple truths in the bible itself. How convenient it must be to have a bible that you can interpret to believe in everything you want it to say. My bible forces me to adapt to Gods way of thinking. I don't decide what's true in His word, He does.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=321063&postcount=55",

Anyone who will make false accusations against someone just because they disagree with them is not worth giving an opportunity to. \n\n Unfortunately, most threads end up disintegrating into flaming after a while. This seems to be completely independent of the age of the poster and seems to be independent of the political orientation of the poster. Though I agree that it is frustrating to be flamed in such a way, you must admit that you also flame so you carry some guilt as well. I will admit that I've occasionally been pushed to flame as well, though I generally try to avoid it as much as possible. Once people start flaming, all hope for reasoned discussion is usually lost. \n \n Anyway, my point was to say that, if you disagree with the flaming, attack that - not Shooterandproud's age. Generally, it makes for a much stronger arguement to attack people's views than to attack something about them that is unrelated to the arguement - such as age.\n \n Besides, Shooterandproud did apologize for the name-calling. Not everyone is big enough to apologize for their flaming.\n \nIF?!?!?!?!?!? Are you kidding me? Every single opinion I offer up here is attacked, mocked, scoffed at, dismissed or refuted by the Godless Heathens, secular Humanists and atheists simply because of my spiritual beliefs as a bible believing christian.\n\n I do realize that there are many people who automatically discount your views because you are strongly believing. That is unfortunate since I have met many highly intelligent people who were simultaneously believers. The ability to reason and present a rational arguement is not always dependent on level of belief. Level of belief mainly seems to rest on the differences in initial assumptions one makes about determining truth, which in turn relies on world view. Though it is perfectly acceptable to attack someone for presenting a limited argument, I do not think it is acceptable or logical to automatically assume that someone of faith has to automatically be incapable of reasoning. I must add, though, that automatically discounting an arguement because of someone's age is also not logical or acceptable. I would hope that all sides would try to be more open minded in not automatically discounting people's arguements because of unrelated factors.\n \n The only thing I would recommend in your case that often seems to elicit flames is that you often present quotes from the Bible as evidence without realizing that, in debates such as this, one needs to present arguements on a platform of knowledge that is mutually accepted. It would be the same as if someone quoted communist doctrine to you as unassailable truth. Since you don't view that as truth, it would make no sense to present such arguments to you. The same goes for your presentation of Biblical quotes as evidence. If the opposition does not believe in the literal validity of the Bible, then your quotes are not useful in any arguement.",

The fact is, that when all is said and done in this life, the gospel that I shared will pe proven to have been the absolute truth.\n\n I realize that you are not quoting your own beliefs but the Bible, whose validity you hold as absolute and whose scriptures demonstrate a strong spiritual power over strong believers such as yourself. However, you must realize that those same quotations from the Bible shown to non-believers will not have any of that power, except if they touch upon universally accepted principles.\n \n You have to ask yourself what your purpose is in presenting those quotes. If your purpose is to try to convert, at least in part, the views of readers to be closer to your views, then you need to address your message in such a way that can be convincing to those readers. That is why the \"know your audience\" rule is so important. If you don't address your arguements to your audience in a way that they can follow, then you might as well not present the arguement at all, since it will not be listened to. There are many points made in the Bible that are universally aknowledged as good - such as limiting selfish instincts, helping the poor and underpriviledged - that can be addressed in universal terms that can be capable of convincing anyone with a conscience. These are points that can be made without reference to theology (reference to God) and win converts to your view based on universal principles alone. \n \n You might have to accept the fact that atheists simply will not be converted to believe in the theological aspect without evidence and, since evidence is lacking, this will likely be a lost cause. However, I am sure that there are many views you hold that can also be argued on universal principles and, there, you might be more succesful. Again, it all depends on your purpose. If your purpose is to convince others to change their views, then you have to address them in terms they can follow. Otherwise, if your purpose is simply to have your say, then you would have to realize that having your say without tailoring its terms to your audience not only leaves your message unheard, but attracts the type of flaming that is frustrating to all of us.",

I am about the journey that led to those truths. Satan would love it if I spent my time here attempting to spread the wisdom of the bible while never offending anyone by telling them the source of my wisdom.

It's because I promote eternal truths that aren't my own at all, but are from God through His word.\n \n And since the darkness hates the light, so do the spiritually dead hate the life I offer in God through Christ and by the power of His Holy Spirit which indwells all who accept what Christ did on the Cross when He shed His unblemished blood for our sins.

Because the Holy Spirit of God which jesus promised the Apostles He would send in His place after He left to prepare a place for us, The HELPER who would guide us and remind us of His teachings. He would be with us until the end of the Age until Jesus came back for His bride, the Church. And the church isn't any building, belief system, religion or denomination. It is every single individual who possesses Gods Holy Spirit within them, whether they be dead in Christ, or alive in Him today. \n \n The Holy Spirit gives us eyes to see and ears to hear Gods truths.

If you were of God, you would love me and embrace my truths. Nothing has changed at all Ao, the same war between the powers of GOOD and EVIL that was taking place in Jesus time on Earth is taking place today in these end times.\n \n Jesus Said:\n Jhn 15:26 \"When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, {that is} the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify about Me, \n \n Jhn 15:27 and you {will} testify also, because you have been with Me from the beginning.",

   "But the bible does touch upon universally accepted principles, yet our strongest debates are due to the fact that the atheists/secular humanists deny those truths in favor of their own limited humanistic opinions about what ought to be considered right and normal. \n\n I'm not sure which universally accepted principles you are speaking of, but if a large number of secular humanists do not accept those principles, then they are probably not universally accepted. The two examples of universally accepted principles I mentioned in the last post were the principle that one should limit ones selfish interest (i.e. not be purely greedy) and that one should care about the poor and underpriviledged. Those two principles are illuminated in the Bible, and they are principles with which most secular humanists would agree.\n \nI present those quotes in direct response to incorrect statements made against either what the bible itself say's, or in opposition to moral beliefs humanists promote as right and correct only because they believe as they do. Remember, I'm arguing that my source of wisdom and truth is self evident, while the secular humanist offers no evidence from any source other than their own very limited personal perspectives which are based on their desire to justify what they themselves feel is right and good in life. \n\n If a poster makes an incorrect statement against something said in the Bible, then it is perfectly legitimate and reasonable for you to present quote from the Bible to refute their arguement.\n \n As for certain secular humanists promoting certain moral beliefs as correct only because they believe so, without stating reasoned support for their beliefs through universal principles, then your stating your beliefs with Biblical quotes ,while also not supporting them with universal principles, will not help. It is the same type of unsupported arguement they use. Two wrongs don't make a right. The only way to make any progress in a debate is to start from principles that most people agree with and logically work from there in debate. \n \nThat isn't defending a position with facts or truth, but is justifying ones personal preferences so they need not change from their shallow and shortsighted world views. In order for the atheist and secular humanist to even hope to be on solid ground philosophically, then \"ABSOLUTE TRUTH\" must be a myth, a creation of man, but nonexistent in reality. I submit to you that to imply that is to fall victim to the great lie of this generation. Absolute truth exists and my God and Creator is the author of it, and His Holy Word, the Bible is the purveyor of it.\n\n But all religions assume that their truth is an absolute truth, and none of them can demonstrate objectivelly that their truth came from God. The only way that people can decide what is true is either to have a spiritual experience themselves or, as in the case of nearly all secular humanists, to judge truth based on the preponderance of evidence - usually scientific evidence. The trouble with basing ones view of truth on spiritual experience is that our emotions can trick us. So many religions have such differing views that it is clear that most, if not all, people with such experiences are misinterpreting them. When you state your experience, we have no way of knowing whether you are misinterpreting your experience or whether it was real since we cannot go into your mind to experience what you had. Since so many people claim to have had spiritual experiences that are similar but which reached different conclusions, it is impossible for outside observers to judge which is right so most either default to the beliefs held by their parents and their local culture or, in the case of secular humanists, rely solely on science to tell them the truth. Unfortunately, there is no way for you to make them experience what you experienced.\n \nBut I am about more than the truths I believe in. I am about the journey that led to those truths. Satan would love it if I spent my time here attempting to spread the wisdom of the bible while never offending anyone by telling them the source of my wisdom.

Nothing has changed at all Ao, the same war between the powers of GOOD and EVIL that was taking place in Jesus time on Earth is taking place today in these end times.\n\n It seems that you don't really get where secular humanists are coming from. Imagine yourself years before your conversion to Christianity and years before the strong spiritual experience you experienced. If I remember correctly, you said that you were a muslim at that time and that it was the spiritial experience which led you to the path toward Christianity. What if you never had that experience? Would you have been as confident in your new beliefs or would you have needed more than the arguements of Christian missionaries to change your mind? Again, secular humanists have not experienced the spiritual awakening that you had. Even many, possibly most, people (even many priests) who even try to attain such a spiritual enlightment fail despite genuine effort. Without such experiences, how can any secular humanist get insight into a supernatural that shows no other possible evidence of itself? They are left with deciding on truth on things that do show evidence of themselves. Again, you had the spiritual experience which leaves you confident of your beliefs, they didn't.",

   "Note here how Archangel, once again, dismisses sources he disagrees with, without saying why they're incorrect. This is precisely what he was accusing others of that led to this discussion in the first place.\n\n \n Statement of beliefs of the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance (OCRT)\n \n really? \n \n they don't agree on most anything, and have no degree's in Bible Theo....\n \n Here is a bit of there statement.\n \n OCRT Statement of Belief:\n \n We are a multi-faith group. As of 2008-FEB, we consist of one Atheist, Agnostic, Christian, Wiccan and Zen Buddhist. Thus, the OCRT staff lack agreement on almost all theological matters, such as belief in a supreme being, the nature of God, interpretation of the Bible and other holy texts, whether life after death exists, what form the afterlife may take, etc.\n \n We do believe:\n bullet In the inherent worth of every person. People are worthy of respect, support, and caring simply because they are human. Unfortunately, we have not reached a consensus on when human life, in the form of an ovum and spermatozoon, becomes a human person. On this matter, our lack of agreement mirrors that of society at large.\n bullet In working towards a culture that is relatively free of discrimination on the basis of gender, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, physical disability, age, etc.\n bullet In the sanctity of the human person. We oppose the use of torture and cruel or unusual punishment including the death penalty. 1\n bullet In the importance of democracy within religious, political and other structures.\n bullet In the separation of church and state; and the freedoms of speech, association, and expression. 2\n bullet That the systems of truth that we have studied on the topics of morals, ethics, and religious belief are not absolute: they vary by culture, by religion, and over time. 3\n bullet In the generally positive influence that most religions have had on their followers and on society. 4\n bullet In the importance of individual believers determining evil influences and policies within their chosen faith group, and strongly advocate for their correction.\n bullet In the importance of education. We believe that people are not truly educated unless they have studied the world's major religions and ethical systems. They need to learn of the good and bad impacts they have had on society. 5",
