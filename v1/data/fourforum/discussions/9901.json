When I look at our western societies I'd say we're pretty damn close right now.\n\n \n a component of fascism was the marriage of estate and corporations, kind of capitalist Marxism.\n But the key element of fascism was the intrusion of the state in all levels of human affairs to the extent of practically removing the wall between private and public life. An Orwellian dystopia is what fascism aims to achieve.\n All governments try to extend their power and control over those they govern. The only protection for individuals is the separation and independence of the branches of government, a free independent media and last but not least a democratic system.\n The price to pay to protect individual liberties against the state is eternal vigilance",

Some disregard it being it takes permission to go in, but that is a strong form of coercement making people scared, so they are going to give in. \n \n That is the most disgusting thing a government should allow, even with permission and opens doors to other big-brother things. If we don't say no to these things and fall for their overly strict supposed security measures, we will have no rights what so ever.\n \n It does seem they attack the middle man, but people don't get involved.
