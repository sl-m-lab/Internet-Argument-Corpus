As far as it stays within your religious house of worship. As soon as you force that opinion onto the public it becomes a completely different issue entirely.\n Specific religious doctrines are not to be favored over others.

If that's so, why is it not all marriages produce children? \n How come gays do have children? (Biologically)\n Then the argument will no doubt turn to \"well it's just disgusting and shouldn't be allowed.\" \n Well so are many sexual fetishes, but I don't hear the kind of uproar about those things as I do against homoseuxals marrying. Divorce destroys marriage. Death destroys marriage. \n Allowing more people to join in marriage would not destroy it but rather it would be more encouraging of marriage. \n There's always the argument that gay relationships never last all that long, but I argue that if in fact there was more social support of marriage and in turn longer term relationships, the responcibility level goes up and thus creates gay relationships which are not thought of as disposible by the gay community.",
