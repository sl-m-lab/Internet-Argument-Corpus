   "Actually, the phrase is \"survival of the fittest.\" It was coined by Herbert Spencer, a philosopher and sociologist. Spencer thought that Darwin's theory of natural selection could be applied to human society and culture. Originally Darwin didn't use the phrase, and in fact didn't like it very much. However, its application to natural selection came into common use and Darwin was persuaded by Wallace (the co-developer of the theory of natural selection) that he should use it to avoid confusion. Darwin did so in the 4th edition of the book, published in 1866 (you can buy a copy for $2995.00 + $9.95 shipping if you want), and continued to use the phrase in the 5th and 6th editions. However, if you have read Darwin (in any of the last three editions), you will be aware that he never used the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" without a clear reference to his prefered term, natural selection. Spencer's phrase is rarely used by a modern evolutionary biologist. When analyzed, the phrase yields a tautology which proves more confusing than clarifying. Natural selection does not. An even better description of the concept is, \"differential reproductive success.\"\n \n Joe Bennet is correct. Spencer's ideas were known as social Darwinism, even though they had nothing to do with Darwin, and Darwin wasn't very pleased about applying the ideas to his theories. But even Hitler got the ideas wrong. Even social Darwinism didn't advocate the elimination of the weak. Even in social Darwinism the principle was that the fittest would survive. There was no concept that the fit should eliminate the unfit - however those things were determined. You must remember that Hitler was a megalomaniac who wasn't actually interested in science, philosophy, or religion, only in how he could twist the concepts to accomplish his goals. If that included distorting social Darwinism or suckering the faithful, he was not above that.\n \n And, of course, Hunter is full of hot air as usual. It is hard to find a creationists who doesn't claim that evolutionists are denying the creationist god and that doing so is an attempt to escape accountability. I'm sure you have all met a creationist who has told you that you will be surprised when you die and find that he is right and you are burning in hell. It is one of those things that endears creationists to the hearts of scientists and the sane, even scientists who are Christians. I'm sure that if we searched through Hunter's posts we would see him declare somewhere what he claims he doesn't believe.",

Nazis and the KKK are proud of their country, But you cannot accuse people that are proud of their country of being nazis.

By common creationist logic you could ALL accuse religious people as setting the non-religious as subhuman",

How typical .\n \n Eugenics\n Darwinism has provided scientific support for eugenics\n Darwin warned against allowing \"the weak members of civilised societies [to] propagate their kind\"\n \"With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilised men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination; we build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed, and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilised societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.\" (Darwin, Charles R.

   "Gosh! Don't you all just love out of context quotes. Peddler8111 is correct in the source of that quote, and what he has given is accurate. However, it should be pointed out that in the preceding paragraph Darwin mentions that he is repeating the views of other naturalists. He specificallly states that, \"Most of my remarks are taken from these three authors.\" Those three authors are E. Ray Lankester, Galton, and Alfred Russel Wallace. Of course, Wallace was fully committed to spiritualism by about 1865 because of his inability to reconcile his ideas of natural selection and evolution with his moral beliefs. The ideas to which Darwin refers were published in 1864 in \"Anthropological Review,\" at at time when Wallace struggling with reconciling those ideas.\n \n Darwin goes on to add his own thoghts in the paragraph following the one cited.\n \nThe aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in the manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused. Nor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon may harden himself whilst performing an operation, for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with an overwhelming present evil. We must therefore bear the undoubtedly bad effects of the weak surviving and propagating their kind; but there appears to be at least one check in steady action, namely that the weaker and inferior members of society do not marry so freely as the sound; and this check might be indefinitely increased by the weak in body or mind refraining from marriage, though this is more to be hoped for than expected.\n\n I'm not sure how social Darwinism was applied during British conquests, but I have already pointed out that social Darwinism is not the idea of Darwin, but of Herbert Spencer.\n \n It also seems that wilted laughter has a reading problem since he comments, \"Social Darwinianism or \"the white mans burden\" was a popular racial theory during the scramble for Africa, which takes it name and principles from the natural selection writings of Charles Darwin.\" Wouldn't it be nice if wilted would learn what he's talking about. Social Darwinism was the idea of Herbert Spencer, not Darwin. Darwin objected to the use of his name and the application of ideas from social Darwinism applied to his works.\n \n As trebor pointed out, social Darwinism has nothing to do with natural selection. In fact, they are quite opposite in concept.",
