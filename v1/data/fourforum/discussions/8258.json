I will take the warning for that.\n \n I am of two minds in this. Every analysis I have seen so far, including that from the Bush administration, has said that violence will increase and the insurgency will gain momentum now that Zarqawi is gone as people who failed to join the resistance in order to avoid association with his methods go ahead and sign up. \n \n We know AQ was considering replacing him for the same reason. His massive civilain casualties, due to his personal vendetta against the shia, drove peopel away from the insurgency.\n \n So, on the up side, we have gotten some good press with his death. On the down side, by killing him we have actually strengthened our enemy. Now AQ will be able to appoint a sucessor with no division or infighting at all, and insurgency recruitment will climb as it did after the saddam arrest. It seems like we did AQs dirty work for them.\n \n Personally, I don't really care either way. The war in IRaq is, from an American standpoint, unwinnable either way. Either we \"win\", in which case Iraq has a pro Iranian government, not really a \"win\", or we loose, in which case we go home and Iraq fights a civil war for several years before (likely) fragmenting into 3 states. A loss would actually be better for the US than a win here. \n \n Regardless, the death of Zarqawi doe not really make any difference. AQ in Iraq was responsible for less than 10% of the attacks taking place there and was unpopular with the local population due to their tactics. He dies and the insurgency grows stronger overall. Beyond that, his death really does not make any kind of difference at all.",

Zarqawi's actions made no secret of the fact that he was attempting to start a Sunni-Shia civil war within Iraq.

That's what the freely elected government of Iraq is trying to do now.

There goes your sense of logic again.\n\n \n RIGHT. We have satellites that can read a newspaper from space and they transported thousands of tons of munitions, equipment, precursors and chemicals to another country without us noticing. We had pictures of mobile hydrogen generators sitting out in the middle of the desert, which shows that we were not just looking of evidence, we were scouring the whole damn country for evidence, and we just didn't happen to notice several hundred trainloads of equipment and materials being carried out of the country.\n \n We can can detect chemical weapons and biological specimens down to 3 parts per MILLION in any medium, and we could not find a single trace of of any of this stuff, so they would have had to hermetically seal everything before they transported it.\n \n face it, Jimbo, even Bush and CO admit that not only were they not there when we invaded, THEY NEVER WERE. Saddam never reconstituted his weapons programs after Gulf I and he destroyed all the weapons he did have. \n \n Your idea that he saw the US invading so he shipped the most effective weapons in his arsenal out of the country is just idiotic. If he DID have such weapons, we would STILL be fighting in the desert and Saddam would STILL be running Iraq, if we had not already been defeated, because our battle plan was not formulated to be victorious against an enemy with nuclear or biological abilities. We did not secure our supply lines as we advanced into Iraq, which is fine if you are just going to keep moving and KNOW you will not have to slow down long enough for the enemies that you left behind you to draw a bead on you. Use of chemical or bio weapons would have slowed us down, and at that point a guy with a case of RPGs could have destroyed our supply lines, throwing the entire invasion into chaos.\n \n Didn't happen. Why did we use such a Battle plan? Because we knew damn well we would not be slowed up by chemical or bio weapons because SADDAM DIDN'T HAVE ANY. Bush \"fixed\" the intel.\n \n We now have ample proof that the weapons simply did not exist. We have ample proof that the Bush administration KNEW they did not exist and simply lied about it, and you keep on retelling the same sad, stupid lies, even after those who invented the lies in the first place have come clean. Do you not understand how much of an idiot this makes you?\n \n \n \nThat's quite simple. Just because something is not there, does not mean that it never was.

By your \"logic\", we were fools to ever think he had any even though the evidence is staring back at you. You have been listening to the liberal left too intently.\n\n \n BS. Not only were the weapons not there, production and storage facilities were not there. You can move weapons. You cannot move production and storage facilities. They are immobile. The only testimony we had that there were weapons programs in place came from Chalibi and his little group of Iranian agents, and frankly you and Bush were both XXXXXX to ever have believed them. Here we have a guy who is being paid directly by Iran. The payments are not even concealed, and we let him goad us into war with Iraq. In Bush defense, it is clear that he fixed the intel, so he might have been smart enough NOT to believe the Iranian spy. It was just certain Americans who were stupid enough to buy what he was selling.",

   "What a brave man he was! I suppose his shooting of failed athletes was okay by you, also. Or maybe his rape/torture rooms were okay, too.\n\n \n He killed thousands of failed athletes? I must have missed this in the news.\n \n \n \nI'll break it into smaller pieces for you.\n \n It is foolish and shows lack of logic to assume that we have only one problem.\n \n Our not finding WMDs is not indicative of Saddam's honesty. It is also not indicative that he did not ignore UN resolutions. (He couldn't ignore the sanctions...they were imposed upon him because of his failure to comply with the resolutions.)\n\n \n Name the resolutions he ignored.\n \n \nAs a matter of fact, Saddam wanted people to think he had WMDs so he thumbed his nose at the world and led people to believe he had them. He was trying to obtain yellow cake (have you read that anywhere yet?) and did have intentions of developing chemical and nuclear weapons.\n\n \n First, Iraq officially reported to the Un on lno less than 17 occasions that they DID NOT HAVE WMDS. Saddam got on TV on no fewer than 10 occasions and announced that ALL THEIR WMDS HAD BEEN DETROYED. You are living in fantasy land.\n \n As far as your idiotic claims about yellow cake, saddam already had 500 TONS of yellow cake. What woud he do with more? His stockpile of yellow cake was growing daily because THEY MINE YELOWCAKE IN IRAQ YOU IMBECILE. They EXPORT the stuff. Since the sanctions kicked in, they had just been stockpiling it because they were not allowed to export it. This is what originally made peopel cry foul on the idiotic nigerian uranium story. Everybody went \"What is Saddam going to do with MORE yellow cake and why would he buy it when he already has hundreds of tons of the stuff?\" That was THINKING people. You just went \"Hmmm...yellowcake...he must be making nukes. \n \n \nIf the world had known that all WMDs had been destroyed, if Saddam had shown the UN inspectors that all WMD had been destroyed and that all UN resolutions had been complied with, there likely would have been no invasion. Duh!\n\n \n He did. On several occasions the Un inspectors announced that they had inspected all facilities requested and found no weapons or production facilities. Each time they were given a longer list. It got to the point that it was ridiculous. Saddam quit cooperating. Finally they passed the last resolution and Saddam gave full cooperation. The Un weapons inspectors asked for 2 weeks to finish inspections once and for all. Bush told them to leave the country, we were going to war. \n \n \nThis does not compute. If a supposedly reliable source gives you information that you pass on that is later shown to be false, you are not both a liar and a fool...just a fool. You've been fooled. You didn't lie about it because you thought it was true. Granted, our intel was flawed, but so was that of the British and the rest of the intelligence community. Most everybody thought we had it right. Even your boy John Kerry thought we had it right.\n\n \n First, I hated Kerry. Second, the british knew the intel was BS and that Bush was fixing it. They just didn't think he would get caught. Bad news, he got caught. Third, nobody really believed Chalibi except for XXXXXX in the general public. Even Bush is not that stupid.\n \n \n \nA problem here is that hindsight is always perfect vision.\n\n \n No hindsight involved. I have been using the SAME argument since the start of the war. \n \n \nWe have not taken possession of and do not intend to maintain control over Iraq.\n\n \n You are delusional.\n \n \n \nThat's laughable. His was the only name on the ballot except for once when some stooge (I think maybe one of his son's) was listed also.\n\n \n As opposed to our elections, where only our stooges were on the ballot.\n \n \n..and I suppose you think he was an alright guy, too.\n \n Is this Praise the Dictators day?\n\n \n I am not priaisn ganybody. merely pointing out that elections do not a free society make.\n \n \nThat's EXACTLY the way it was in Iraq for the last 30 years. We've fixed that part already.\n\n \n We changed nothing. We apointed a contitutional council then killed anybody who disagreed with our appointments. We shoved an election system on them and killed anybody who disagreed with it. Unfortunatly it backfired and despite our best efforts, our rigged elections did not come out as promised. Now the security and defense ministries are running death squads and we are still killing people who are fighting our view on how Iraq shoudl function.\n \n \nThe government of Iraq is being handed over to the Iraqis...unlike your description of puppet government forced on them. If they choose to elect pro-Iranian islamofascists, so be it. At least now anyone who dares can run for office. Hopefully someday there'll be no bombs set off near the ballot boxes.\n\n \n Not \"so be it\". A vote for the islamic fundamentalists was seen as a vote for Iran and a vote against America, and they won by a landslide. Now we are in deep trouble. Now we are killing the secularists and those who want to live in a free society, free from the shackles of islamic fundamentalism, because otherwise we would have to admit that we were WRONG.",

There is likely not a single country where all people are terrorists. You could refraise these questions to apply to individual people and they would be more easily answered.

If the provider knows what the intent of the receiver is, that's a different story. If I know that you will murder someone if I give you a loaded pistol, then I am bad.\n \n Contributing ANYTHING to a group with knowledge that they will use it for terrorism and indiscriminate murder is just as evil as the terrorists themselves.\n \n \n2. if a country helped to put in power a tyrant that killed thousands of kurds, would you consider that country a terrorist supporter?\nAgain, it relates to the knowledge of intent. I doubt the US knew Saddam would turn into a tyrannical murdering bastard when they helped him. Recall that for a time, many people thought Hitler was a cool dude. Just as I do not support everything Bush has done since he obtained his position, I do not blame the voters that installed him for his shortcomings.\n \n \n3. if that said country gave that said tyrant approval to use chemical and biological weapons on his enemies, would you consider that country a terrorist supporter?\nI have problems with chemical/biological weapons period. I do not condone their use at all. I doubt that Saddam needed anyone's approval to use the weapons. I do understand that some of the chemical weapons were supplied by the US (some by the Russians) but I do not extend the blame for their use as anything besides a deterrent to the people who provided them. Many countries have chem/bio weapons to rattle. Saddam's use of them on entire populations of citizens was barbaric. He should die just for that. Again, his actions do not make the supplier responsible. To say that is to say that ultimately the manufacturers of guns are responsible for all deaths by gunshot.\n \n \n \n4. if a country's former president and governemt officials were doing business and investing in the businesses of the friends and family of a known terrorist, would you consider that country a terrorist supporter?\nI assume you're referring to GHWB and the Saudi RF. I doubt there was any knowledge on the part of the Bushs that terrorism would be expanded as a direct result of their participation in business deals with anyone else. If you can specify any act that might have done so, I'll be happy to address that particular issue. However, doing business with a person while knowing that person is a wife beater does not mean you want his wife beaten. Some business deals are made because one knows that if you don't do it, someone else will.

A person supplying goods and services to a terrorist organization (one whose sole intent is to terrorize) is a supporter of terrorism. A person supplying goods and services to an entire country that has legitimate use of such goods and services outside the bounds of terrorism is not knowingly supporting terrorism. The fact that quite a number of gangs live in LA does not mean that LA is harboring gangs. If it did, I would recommend cutting all Federal funds to California, because California is obviously home to a lot a gangs.\n \n Again, I do not classify countries as homogeneous entities.

In fact, the Germans voluntarily paid for the construction of our bases there and NATO pays part of the maintenance costs.\n \n In Korea, we LOST the war, cut the country in half, and left our troops to secure the border, with the full suport of S korea. In the last 10 or so years the koreans have started pressuring us to remove some troops, which we have done.\n \n The comparisons you are making here are simply foolish....almost as delusional as comparing the war in Iraq to WWII and trying to cast saddam in the role of hitler.\nMy point was that we are not \"occupying forces\" in Iraq. We are not dictating governmental policy at the point of a gun as the Germans did in \"occupied France\" prior to LIBERATION by the Allied Forces.\n \n Twist and turn all you like...it's amusing!",

   "This falls apart at the mention of \"hostile state\". Iraq is not a hostile state. The Iraqi government is not fighting against the so-called \"occupying forces\".\n\n I was wondering that myself, actually, since I saw nothing that clearly explained what a \"hostile state\" is. Article 42 clearly indicates that the \"hostile army\" is that of the invading forces. But, given the reasons we started this war in the first place, wouldn't Iraq have been considered a hostile state at the time the U.S. invaded? Are you saying that once we actually had control of Iraq our military ceased to be an \"occupying force\"? That makes no logical sense to me. Regardless, none of this addresses the fact that the UN resolution I linked clearly says military occupation need not be permanent to be considered military occupation.\n \n \nThey are cooperating and working with coalition forces to rebuild their country, which BY THE WAY is not a destroyed country.\n\n I don't understand what you're trying to say here. If it isn't destroyed, how can it be rebuilt? Are you saying we didn't destroy it? That may be correct, but dropping bombs everywhere sure as hell doesn't improve infrastucture.\n \n Back to the original topic at hand:\n It is easy to react quickly and emotionally to those who would use extreme violence against others. That is the purpose of terrorism (and, in fact, why they call it that). The goal of terrorists is not to kill all of their enemies, but to work them into such emotional chaos that they become unable to function rationally and destroy themselves. Call it cowardice, call it whatever. It's also efficient and inexpensive. And with every reactionary editorial I read, every 24-hour news network I see that can't seem to stop talking about people plotting to blow things up when they're nowhere near having the means to do so, I see how effective terrorism can be without so much as a firecracker.",

You merely scoffed at them (as I expected).\n\n you have got to be joking to think that i would copy and paste and break down articles that you simply linked to. i summarized my debunks. is that a problem?\n \n from the first article it is shown that our justification for invading iraq was because he exploited islam, exploiting suffering and corrupting the public record. do you support this justification for sending over 140,000 american troops to wage war against iraq?\n \n the second and sixth article both talk about how saddam fooled the US into thinking he had wmds. if you were watching the news prior to our invasion, youd know that saddam continuously denied that he had wmds. and the weapons inspectors confirmed this. in fact, there are actually no facts that support the claim that saddam wanted anybody to THINK he had wmds. if you know of anything that saddam said or did to intentionally make the world think that he had wmds, please post, quote or link them\n \n the third article and fifth articles compare the attrocities of bush to the attrocities of other former presidents. apparently the message is that we should continue to endorse presidents that commit attrocious actions, because we did so in the past. do you agree with this notion?\n \n the fourth article is entirely speculations on what dual-purpose technology could have been used for. it doesnt provide any facts, but is loaded with presumptions and speculations, none of which have been or possibly can be verified as true. do you think that these speculations can be used to support going to war in iraq?",

You asked me to show where you had changed what I said. I pointed to post 80 wherein you changed what I had said in post 79. I had said in post 79 that I preferred a well placed bullet to an invasion. You said in the very next post that I was totally in favor of invading countries run by tyrants. You lied. I quite frankly have better things to do with my time.\n \n I didn't ask you to debunk any whole source I linked. I asked you to quote from them what you think is wrong and post what is right with a link to your source as I would not be taking your word for it. I still haven't seen any links to sources.\n \n However, you needn't bother now as I do not intend to respond to you.",

   "from every discussion on this board concerning the war in iraq, you've been in support of the actions bush took, which was the invasion of iraq. if youve changed your position to that of not supporting the actions that bush took, NOT invading iraq, but just assassinating saddam instead, then i really misunderstood that, i admit\n \n so is it that you dont support the invasion of iraq? i just want to clarify that so i dont inadvertently change what you said based on a misunderstanding\n \n as for my responses to the articles, i need not provide links or quote sources. my responses were my observations based on the articles themselves, and i asked you if you agree or not. seems like an exercise that simple is out of your scope of competencies",
