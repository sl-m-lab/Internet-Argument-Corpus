   "Whether it is the War in Iraq, a military attack Iran or the overthrow of the Syrian monarchy. There is an Israeli link to all of them. The Israeli version of Middle Eastern history is the main version the American people receive via the mass media. Many of the American Evangelists Churches use the Bible to back-up the Israeli interpretation of Middle Eastern history. Basically the same tactics of lies and deceit used against the American Indians for the last five hundred years. They are very similar as the tactics the Israelis are using against the Palestinian and Arab people today. \n \n Only the United States government and America's main street mass media have brainwashed the majority of the American people that the Israelis are the victims today. In the eyes of the Arab nations and most of the rest of the world the Palestinian people are perceived as the victims. As much as most of the American people see the Palestinian as the terrorists so do the people of the majority of the rest of the world see the Israelis as a terrorist's nation. The Jewish Temples in America raising many billions of dollars to finance the State of Israel aggression against the Palestinian people. The United States government has given the State of Israel over a hundred billion dollars of military and financial aid over the years. With international protocol preventing any real support for the Palestinian people struggle for justice and freedom from Israeli occupation. \n \n Within this conflict between the Palestinian and Israelis is the great divide between the United States and Israel and the rest of the world. Today if the Israeli government were controlling less of the land than they were granted in 1948 under United Nation Resolution 181 similar to the Palestinian people today. Then the United States and Israel might have a case they could take to the international community of nations. When in reality the United States as part of its Middle East policy would rather have the fighting over there as long as it does not interfere with the flow of oil. As long as the Middle East Oil Kingdoms are living on the edge the United States military is there only savior to them keeping their power. \n \n The tyrannical oil regimes in the Middle East are in part the creation of the western industrial nations for a guarantee steady supply of relatively cheap oil. The creation of the State of Israel in part was compensation for the horrific war crime taken against the Jewish people as well as a way to deal with the unwanted Jewish refugees from World War II. The creation of a Jewish State of Israel would infuriate the Arab world deepening the dividing of the Arab people from their leaders. Israel would be the thorn that the Arab people would direct their anger and hostilities taking the pressure off of the Western oil deals. \n \n My Blog http://www.globalcrier.blogspot.com/",

   "It is the victors of War that are the revisionist of history for the truth has never been told in mainstream history books about the 1967 Six Day War in America. To understand the truth you have to understand the history to the conditions and the reality on the ground on both sides. Most often you will find the truth somewhere in the middle of what both sides are saying. The following is a brief overview to the history of the 1967 Six Day War. \n \n The Six Day War was about twenty years after the establishment of the new Jewish State of Israel. Between 1947 and 1966 the Jewish State of Israel nearly double in size becoming one continuous Jewish State. A constant flow of Palestinian refugees flowed into neighboring Arab nations over the years making room for the new Jewish immigrants from other lands. During this time in history the world's oil supply could out produce global demands. This being when the western industrial nations still had the Arab Oil Monarchies on a tight leash. \n \n From 1948 to the 1967 War the Israelis had built a Jewish nation with much of it at the expense of the indigenous Palestinian people. As living conditions improved for the Jewish Israeli people they got worst for the indigenous Palestinian people. The Israeli violating many of the terms and conditions of United Nations Resolution 181creating the Jewish State and Palestinian State out of one land of Palestine. \n \n Israel's poor non-oil producing Arab neighbors were planning an attack on the Jewish State of Israel. For over 20 years hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees had been fleeing to their countries. The Jewish people assault on the Palestinian people was for their vision of the Greater Jewish State of Israel. After twenty years of the combination of the Zionist movement and the Jewish Biblical teaching and millions of new Jewish immigrants being financed by the world's Jewish Temples created the conditions for the 1967 War. \n \n After the United States government learned of the impending Arab military attack on Israel. The United States laid out the promises and conditions to Egypt and the Arab nations if they attacked Israel first. Nasser called off the Egyptian Air attack on Israel with the other Arab nations following. It was the international pressure put on the Arab nations that prevented them from the first attack in the 1967 War. The Israeli learning of this planned attack by the Arabs started the Six Day War by attacking the Egyptian Air Force when they had abandon their planes all lined up on the runway. \n \n The living conditions of the Palestinian people in the refugee camps are very similar to the Jewish Ghettos in Europe during World War II. The Jewish decedents of the Holocaust have created similar living conditions for the Palestinian people as their ancestors lived without the death camps. For the most part the Arab nations have been convinced not to help the Palestinian people in their struggle for their human rights. Any nation that tries to help the Palestinian people without approval will face retaliation from the United States, Israel and the international community. \n \n My Blog http://www.globalcrier.blogspot.com/",

   "Why don't people hear the truth about what is going on in the City of Hebron the largest Palestinian City in the West Bank? There were 130,000 plus Palestinian living in Hebron in 2000 and today there are about 100,000 Palestinians living there. For most part of the last six years the Palestinians people of Hebron have been living in lock down conditions similar to the conditions of Jewish Ghettos of Europe before World War II. \n \n There are approximately 500 Jewish settlers living in the middle of the City of Hebron in four settlements known as the Hilltop Jewish Settlers. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) protects the Jewish settlers in Hebron. The IDF have created Jewish Only Roads going in and out of Hebron for the Jewish settlers safe passages. Destroying the homes and farms of thousands of Palestinian people to create the Jewish Only Roads and Open Space, Green Zones other wise known as security zones. \n \n This is the true reality on the ground in Hebron during the Peace Talks of the late 90's up until today for the Palestinian people of Hebron. There is no freedom of travel for the Palestinian people of Hebron with a very few exception. They can't get their items to and from the markets outside Hebron. Without going threw IDF checkpoints that could take from a few hours to a few days for the Palestinian can pass through. Similar stories as there in Hebron are true in the Gaza and other Palestinian West Bank villages. \n \n The truth of the matter is the Jewish Israelis have been terrorizing the Palestinian people for the last sixty + years. The Israeli have had total control of the Holy Land of Palestine since the 1967 Six-Day War. They have made living conditions unbearable for the Palestinian people trying to depopulate the Muslim population creating a pure Jewish State of Greater Israel. The goals and dreams of the Zionist's movement are very similar as those of the Nazi in having a pure state of their own kind.",

   "Jewish people will tell you that other people are jealous because of their great success. To some degree this is true. The Jewish people are so few in numbers yet they have so much wealth and power in the world. Today global tensions are rising and the divide is deepening between nations around the world and the Jewish people of 18 million are in the middle once again. The Middle East oil deals of the 1930's and the creation of the Jewish State of Israel of 1948 are at the roots of the tensions in the Middle East. \n \n If there were no oil of any significance in the Middle East the Jewish State of Israel would not be the problem it is today. It was with the creation of a few very wealthy Arab families from the western oil deals that fuels the fire of anger in the Arab Streets. Again, so few Arab people with almost everything and so many Arab people with very little to nothing. \n \n The creations of the Jewish State of Israel served three purposes. 1. To be a homeland to the unwanted Jewish refugees from World War II. 2. It was partial reparation for the horrific War Crimes committed against the Jewish society in World War II. 3. Israel is and was a beacon to take the focus of the anger on the Arab street off of the wealthy oil deals. This is why the United States and Great Britain have leading roles in the Middle East problems. \n \n Yes, the people of the Middle East have to solve their own problems, but the outside world has to change their ways with the nations of the Middle East. The wealthy Middle Eastern oil nations have to take a leading role in the region. In the past as a part of unwritten policies the western industrial nations wanted to keep the Middle East divided keeping them from becoming to powerful, again because of oil. To solve the problems in the Middle East you are going to have to solve both of the major problems simultaneously.\n \n International Crude Oil Export Tax http://globalcrier.blogspot.com/2006/01/international-crude-oil-export-tax-oet.html\n \n Peace Reform Initiative in the Middle East\n http://peacereform.blogspot.com/",
