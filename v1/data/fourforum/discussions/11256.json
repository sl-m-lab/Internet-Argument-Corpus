   "Millions of people in India live on the equivalent of one dollar per day. Eric Robert Rudolph lived on a few dollars per week before being captured behind a dumpster. These being proof that humans can survive on just a few dollars per week, what should keep us from declaring that a few dollars per week is all any one human should receive free from the government? That is, let the government pay each breathing citizen a stipend for life that is limited to the equivalent of a few dollars per week. Payments to minors would go to one of their parents or to a guardian. The incentive to have children is not in all ways a bad thing. There being more mouths to feed causes a need for more workers to produce more food for them, and more clothing, and more items of life such as toys, utensils and other consumables. Children would be born at whatever rate the market will bear.\n \n Since every single person will be receiving free from the government enough funds to survive, there will be no need of a minimum wage. People who want to raise their standards above threshold poverty and enjoy the finer things of life, as we know them today could do what most of those that currently enjoy those things did to get where they are today...work for it, their wages being set by whatever the market will bear. The successful people are working at wages far above the minimum, so the minimum might as well not be there. Their wages are set by whatever the market will bear.\n \n Since exercise and practicing motor skills develop those skills, there should be no child labor laws save the ones wherein children are kept from physical harm, abuse and involuntary servitude. Since all work would return wages at some rate or another, each task would command whatever wages the market would bear. \n \n Children's work should not interfere with their voluntary education to be provided year round by the government to include language, reading, writing and mathematics only, but at various levels of difficulty and scope. Those who are drawn to various interests will read of them and develop their knowledge according to their interests. Art supplies will be made available. The artists and artisans will express themselves in due time...and may even have other people working for them in the future. Musical instruments and basic instructions will be available for those interested. The musicians will express themselves and the talented will succeed in getting paid to perform. Colleges and Universities should all be private businesses, not associated with government.\n \n Those who don't want to go to school can go to work. Those who want to go to college can pay for it. Everybody can work. Wages for any given paying task will whatever the market will bear. There will be no free lunches...except for the few dollars per week needed to survive.\n \n Speaking of the current US minimum wage, why is it that restaurants can get away with paying their waiters and waitresses $2.13 per hour? The restauranteurs become rich, the waitresses struggle to keep up their required uniforms. Does this make you want to tip 30% or not?",

The idea that an American could survive off $1 a day is a joke when it costs $1.25 for a bottle of water. You're talking about an overhaul that would more or less throw away the entire economic situation in the United States and start over. Why not do this? Well, perhaps we should start with the fact that it's impossible.\n \n \nSpeaking of the current US minimum wage, why is it that restaurants can get away with paying their waiters and waitresses $2.13 per hour? The restauranteurs become rich, the waitresses struggle to keep up their required uniforms. Does this make you want to tip 30% or not?\n\n \n I don't really know where you're going with this. We don't need minimum wages because waitresses are likely to be highly-tipped? If that's what you're saying, it doesn't follow because waitresses are about the only people who America who are regularly tipped for their job. What about millions of others working on minimum wage that don't get tips?",
