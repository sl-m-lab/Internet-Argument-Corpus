   "If you think the illegal drugs are costly....just look at this information about the legal ones.\n \n ==========================================================\n \n Let's hear it for Costco!! (This is just mind boggling!) Make sure you \n read all the way past the list of the drugs. The woman that signed \n below is a Budget Analyst out of federal \n Washington, DC offices. \n \n \n Did you ever wonder how much it costs a drug company for the active \n ingredient in prescription medications? Some people think it must cost \n a lot, since many drugs sell for more than $2.00 per tablet. We did a \n search of offshore chemical synthesizers that supply the active \n ingredients found in drugs approved by the FDA. As we have revealed in \n past issues of Life Extension, a significant percentage of drugs sold \n in the United \n States contain active ingredients made in other countries. In our \n independent investigation of how much profit drug companies really \n make, \n we obtained the actual price of active ingredients used in some of the \n most popular drugs sold in America. \n \n \n The data below speaks for itself. \n \n Celebrex: 100 mg \n Consumer price (100 tablets): $130.27 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $0.60 \n Percent markup: 21,712% \n \n \n 10 Claritin: 10 mg \n Consumer Price (100 tablets): $215.17 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $0.71 \n Percent markup: 30,306% \n \n \n Keflex: 250 mg \n Consumer Price (100 tablets): $157.39 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $1.88 \n Percent markup: 8,372% \n \n \n Lipitor: 20 mg \n Consumer Price (100 tablets): $272.37 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $5.80 \n Percent markup: 4,696% \n \n \n 10 Norvasc: 10 mg \n Consumer price (100 tablets): $188.29 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $0.14 \n Percent markup: 134,493% \n \n \n 20 Paxil: 20 mg \n Consumer price (100 tablets): $220.27 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $7.60 \n Percent markup: 2,898% \n \n \n 30 Prevacid: 30 mg \n Consumer price (100 tablets): $44.77 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $1.01 \n Percent markup: 34,136% \n \n \n \n \n Prilosec: 20 mg \n Consumer price (100 tablets): $360.97 \n Cost of general active ingredients $0.52 \n Percent markup: 69,417% \n \n \n Prozac: 20 mg \n Consumer price (100 tablets) : $247.47 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $0.11 \n Percent markup: 224,973% \n \n \n 50 Tenormin: 50 mg \n Consumer price (100 tablets): $104.47 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $0.13 \n Percent markup: 80,362% \n \n \n \n 10 Vasotec: 10 mg \n Consumer price (100 tablets): $102.37 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $0.20 \n Percent markup: 51,185% \n \n \n 1 Xanax: 1 mg \n Consumer price (100 tablets) : $136.79 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $0.024 \n Percent markup: 569,958% \n \n \n 20 Zestril: 20 mg \n Consumer price (100 tablets) $89.89 \n Cost of general active ingredients $3.20 \n Percent markup: 2,809 \n \n \n 600 Zithromax: 600 mg \n Consumer price (100 tablets): $1,482.19 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $18.78 \n Percent markup: 7,892% \n \n \n 40 Zocor: 40 mg \n Consumer price (100 tablets): $350.27 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $8.63 \n Percent markup: 4,059% \n \n \n \n 50 Zoloft: 50 mg \n Consumer price: $206.87 \n Cost of general active ingredients: $1.75 \n Percent markup: 11,821% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Since the cost of prescription drugs is so outrageous, I thought \n everyone should know about this. Please read the following and pass it \n on. \n \n \n It pays to shop around. This helps to solve the mystery as to why they \n can afford to put a Walgreen's on every corner. On Monday night, \n Steve Wilson, an investigative reporter for Channel 7 News in Detroit, \n did a story on generic drug price gouging by pharmacies. He found in \n his investigation, that some of these generic drugs were marked up as \n much as 3,000% or more. Yes, that's not a typo.....three thousand \n percent! So often, we blame the drug companies for the high cost of \n drugs, and usually rightfully so. But in this case, the fault clearly \n lies with the pharmacies themselves. For example, if you had to buy a \n prescription drug, and bought the name brand, you might pay $100 for \n 100 pills. \n The pharmacist might tell you that if you get the generic equivalent, \n they would only cost $80, making you think you are \"saving\" $20. What \n the pharmacist is not telling you is that those 100 generic pills may \n have only cost him $10! \n \n \n At the end of the report, one of the anchors asked Mr. Wilson whether \n or not there were any pharmacies that did not adhere to this practice, \n and he said that Costco consistently charged little over their cost \n for the generic drugs. \n \n \n I went to the Costco site, where you can look up any drug, and get its \n online price. It says that the in-store prices are consistent with the \n online prices. I was appalled. Just to give you one example from my own \n experience, I had to use the drug, Compazine, which helps prevent \n nausea in chemo patients. \n \n \n \n I used the generic equivalent, which cost $54.99 for \n 60 pills at CVS. I checked the price at Costco, and I could have bought \n 100 pills for $19.89. For 145 of my pain pills, I paid $72.57. I could \n have got 150 at Costco for $28.08. \n \n \n I would like to mention, that although Costco is a \"membership\" type \n store, you do NOT have to be a member to buy prescriptions there, as it \n is a federally regulated substance. You just tell them at the door that \n you wish to use the pharmacy, and they will let you in. (this is true) \n \n \n I went there this past Thursday and asked them. I am asking each of \n you to please help me by copying this letter, and passing it into your \n own e-mail, and send it to everyone you know with an e-mail address. \n \n \n Sharon L. Davis \n Budget Analyst \n U.S. Department of Commerce \n Room 6839 \n Office Ph: 202-482-4458 \n Office Fax: 202-482-5480 \n E-mail Address: sdavis@doc.gov",

   "No offense to Jim, as I have a lot of respect for him, but this post sounded less like an informative article, but an advertisement for Costco. People have many misconceptions about the cost of drugs. Most people have little idea if where the real costs come from. Here is a general idea, at least from the US point of view.\n \n 1. Active ingredient (as shown in Jim's post)\n 2. Inactive ingredients (fillers, binders, and other materials needed to contain and deliver the active ingredient)\n 3. Cost of deveploment of the drug, which generally involves years of research, testing, and analysis even before FDA approval is given.\n 4. Marketing (TV, radio, magazine, etc...not to mention the drug reps, who wine and dine doctors and other health care workers to the tune of BILLIONS a year just to have the doctors use their product)\n 5. Cost of production (workers who actually make the drugs, who happen to be payed well because it is a dangerous job, and all other workers associated with the drug company, ie janitors, paramedics / EMTS, firefighters (many drug manufacturing plants have their own fire depts), office staff, etc).\n 6. Cost to ship the drug to your town and pharmacy.\n 7. Cost added by the pharmacy, including the charge for the pharmacist (who makes a lot of money).\n \n These are only a few of the more obvious costs associated with the cost of the pills that one can get at the pharmacy.",
