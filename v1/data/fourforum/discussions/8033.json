   "I think this is totally cool. \"The Star Spangled Banner\" has been recorded in Spanish. Now for some stupid reason, people are finding this disrespectful. What is wrong with them? Even Bush says that it should only be performed in English. But as I've said before (on here or other places or both) what does he know?\n Here's what I say: The idea that the American national anthem can be translated and perform in a diffierent language is totally awesome. I'd be willing to bet that most people don't even understand the song in English. If they can understand it well enough to translate it, more power to them.\n Also, it is good because of the whole load of XXXX about imigration and that stuff for Latin Americans to be able to stick it to the man and say they are proud to be here.\n \n So I just want to know what is wrong with the people who find this disrespectful.",
