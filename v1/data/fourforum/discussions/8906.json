   "Not nearly enough facts in that little article to say for sure but considering they busted out the \"right to privacy\" I would say their claim holds no water\n \n \nSean Summers, an attorney for Snyder, says that unlike a rally in a park where First Amendment speech is protected, funeral-goers were a \"captive audience,\" forced to listen and see the protest.\n I hope this isn't their audience...if you are protesting outside an office building the people inside are \"a captive audience forced to listen to the protest\" yet thats ok. In fact, the whole purpose of a protest is to grab an audience. If the living constitutionalist judges were ever consistent (and they are not so it makes no difference) than the \"forced to listen\" arguement would actually work.",

However - the prejudice is the same - your actions may not be as cruel and disruptive, but the \"different point of view\" is a hurtful prejudice none the less. Whether you ask, attempt to demand (via law) or just wish they would stop acting like the gay people they are and put shackles on their happiness (by not having intimate and loving relationships) - it is the view that gays are not worthy of the love they desire. You believe they should remain celibate or live a lie when you would never demand that of yourself or others like you (heterosexuals). That is a disparity - its prejudicial - and it is hurtful - even if you don't protest at funerals or try to force it.\n \n Reason away about it *just* being a different point of view. But don't fool yourself into thinking you aren't hurting people.",

It's not a difference in \"sanity-level\", it's often the diffence between prejudice and non-prejudice. IMO, disagreement with a POV isn't the same as prejudice when that disagreement comes out of genuine religious belief. There comes a point where it becomes prejudice with some people, and religion is used as an excuse to act out one's prejudice for some people, such as Phelps. But just because some believe gay relations are not ok doesn't mean it's prejudice. It may be simply straightforward religious belief, and I can confidently say that's the case for me. Just because YOU don't believe in absolute truth doesn't mean your high-and-mighty attitude toward people that do is right. Your view is simply unrealistic; like it or not a lot of GOOD people don't believe gay relations are ok, and they don't hate gay people, nor are they bigots. That may not fit into your preconceived close views, but it's reality. You may go on and accuse me of prejudice all you want, but my conscience is completely clear on it because I know good and well it's not the case with me.",

   "\"There can be no falsehood when mere opinions are stated,\" attorneys for the Westboro Baptist Church said Monday in a motion filed in U.S. District Court.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n \n \n \nSean Summers, an attorney for Snyder, says that unlike a rally in a park where First Amendment speech is protected, funeral-goers were a \"captive audience,\" forced to listen and see the protest.\n\n \n I'm a fan of free speech. Surely there is some compromise...\n Possibly along the lines of a \"zone\" where they could legally protest.\n \n \n \nActually, they very opposite happens because they do a lesser-realized service to the \"religious anti-gay\" stance: because they're so bad and so hateful, they help keep the average \"anti-gay\" people more in the center.\n\n Along those lines, I wonder how many people they have pushed into having more 'liberal' positions just because they are reviled by the hate.\n \n But on another level, it also helps to show people's \"true colors\" on the issues.\n \"Laws passed by Congress and 29 states to prevent Fred Phelps and his congregation from disrupting military funerals have not ended their protests or silenced their anti-gay message.\"\n http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-09-13-funeral-protests_x.htm\n \n Interesting how they specify MILITARY funerals. I believe Phelps protested at Matthew Shepherd's funeral long before he ever protested at a military funeral. So it seems obvious that people should know that he doesn't JUST target military funerals.\n But then some of the legislation specifies MILITARY funerals...\n \n Interesting how the legislation leaves out the funerals of non-military members, like gays, who Phelps is evidently still free to protest...",
