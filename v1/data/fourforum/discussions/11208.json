   "Why did you comment on charity and political leanings then link to something about religion and charitable giving? Only in the US are being right wing and religious related, and then only for WASPS.\nIf you bothered to read the link, you'd see it has a section on politcal parties and charitible giving. I would have pasted it for you but I've been chastised by those who know it all already for not writing in my own words.\n \n If you like, I'll edit my post and you can read it again.\n \n \n Aaaah, yes...here it is.\n \n Charity and political parties\n \n Decent scholarship has demonstrated the disproportionate influence the secular left has over the modern Democratic Party. My research establishes a link between secular views and strikingly low levels of charitable giving and volunteering. While differences in charitable behavior are not particularly apparent between left and right per se, my findings do suggest that, if secularists play an increasing role in the direction of the Democratic Party, indifference (or even hostility) to private charity will probably rise within that party.\n \n If this prediction seems hyperbolic, one should only look at the nations of Western Europe, often considered the ideological models for the American left, and in which religious practice and charity levels are generally far lower than those in America. Take Spain as an example: As this traditionally Catholic country ran full tilt toward socialism starting in 1982, the concomitant attitude of the Spanish governments toward organized religion and private philanthropy became unsympathetic. Charities and churches were viewed as usurping centralized power in social welfare and, even worse, as devolving funding decisions to individual (often wealthy, conservative) donors. The result was a tax system and other public policies that did not encourage private charity or a healthy nonprofit and voluntary sector. (The socialists were ultimately voted out of power by Jose Mar\u00eda Aznar&#8217;s center-right Popular Party, and Spanish tax law has recently become more accommodating to private charitable activity.) Today, the average Spaniard is 20 percentage points less likely than the average American to classify himself as &#8220;religious,&#8221; gives less than half as much to charity, and volunteers about one-fifth as often.7 And Spain has the highest level of charitable giving per capita in Western Europe (and has church attendance rates that are among the highest as well). \n \n While many Spaniards would argue that current religious and charitable practices are a rebound legacy of the 40-year right-wing dictatorship of Francisco Franco, the fact is that Spanish rates are trending toward the rest of Western Europe, almost all of which has not so recently suffered under a dictator who imposed hardcore religious and social norms on the population. What Spain has most in common today with the rest of Europe is a tendency toward a leftist, secular outlook and &#8212; not coincidentally, it appears &#8212; a falling concern for religion and charity.\n \n Whether this tendency is a virtue or a vice is a subjective matter. Progressive Europe holds the secular left viewpoint as a mark of distinction, often consciously placing it in counterpoint to America&#8217;s supposed unsophistication. &#8220;Mr. and Mrs. Average [America] share an uncomplicated faith with its roots in the puritanism of their forebears,&#8221; reported the bbc recently.8 Similarly, R\u00e9gis Debray (a former advisor to French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand) wrote in the New York Times (February 23, 2003):\n \n \n Europe defends a secular vision of the world. It does not separate matters of urgency from long-term considerations. The United States compensates for its shortsightedness, its tendency to improvise, with an altogether biblical self-assurance in its transcendent destiny.\n \n Notwithstanding the eloquence of Debray&#8217;s obvious distaste for Americans in general, he uses inappropriately broad brush strokes in describing us. Indeed, approximately 70 million Americans can be classified as secularists along the lines that I have outlined here. Whether or not these people politically resemble our European friends more than the rest of America is a question for other writers. What we may conclude here, however, is that this group represents an exemplary model of European charity.\n \n Perhaps it does not matter whether the Democrats become the party of &#8220;un-charity.&#8221; The fight for political appeal may not depend on the perception that one party promotes individual sacrifice while the other does not. Popular support may only depend on tangible policies: the minimum wage, welfare reform, abortion rights, &#8220;faith-based initiatives,&#8221; school vouchers, and a host of other issues that focus on how the government affects us as citizens, not how we voluntarily affect one another. This is an empirical question: Do we see our politics as a reflection of our values or simply as a means to leverage a set of policies favorable to our wishes?\n \n On the other hand, a growing un-charity might bode ill for American progressive politics. In his The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), Thorstein Veblen, the iconoclastic economist from the early twentieth century, wrote that the &#8220;residue of the religious life &#8212; the sense of communion with the environment, or with the generic life process &#8212; as well as the impulse of charity or of sociability, act in a pervasive way to shape men&#8217;s habits of thought for the economic purpose.&#8221; Tocqueville made roughly the same point even more vividly in Democracy in America (1835): &#8220;Men are . . . immeasurably interested in acquiring fixed ideas of God, of the soul, and of their general duties to their Creator and their fellow men; for doubt on these first principles would abandon all their actions to chance and would condemn them in some way to disorder and impotence.&#8221; Certainly, Tocqueville and Veblen are not alone in the belief that economic and cultural health are dependent on the related values of religion and charity. And it is not hard to imagine a growing popular distaste for a political wing distinguished by its lack of giving spirit and religious spirituality. \n \n Some religious liberals &#8212; who currently give and volunteer at rates comparable to religious conservatives &#8212; may ultimately sense they face a choice between politics and charity, and many may choose the latter. (This danger is reminiscent of the well-documented Democratic hemorrhage of Catholic voters over the past 20 years, commonly attributed to the increasingly strict party line against pro-life viewpoints.) Indeed, the importance of charity to a religious lifestyle might be one &#8220;missing link&#8221; in explaining why fewer and fewer religious people have tended to classify themselves as Democrats over the past 30 years &#8212; from 37 percent in 1972, to 31 percent in 1983, to 25 percent in 1998.\n \n While it appears inseparable from religion, charitable activity does not inherently privilege a particular political ideology. On the one hand, charity often functions as an alternative to &#8220;big government&#8221; or explicitly injects religious faith into social programs. On the other hand, as scholar Peter Frumkin notes in On Being Nonprofit (Harvard University Press, 2002), much charitable activity is harmonious with social advocacy and functions in partnership with government. Thus, it is not axiomatic that the increasing role of secularists in American progressive politics should necessarily drive charity &#8212; and hence charitable people &#8212; out of the Democratic Party. The key for Democrats is to focus on the ways in which faith-based charity and secular social agendas converge and to make peace with those who see a higher authority over man than the federal government or United Nations.\n \n \n \n ***********************************************************************************************************************\n There is a correlation though. The Democratic party is replete with liberals, secularists and atheists.",

The list of countries you give are not all socialist by any means, I'm not going to delve into the marxist critique of why China isn't socialist.\n \n I'm also not sure how quoting Churchill, a tory aristocrat with vast wealth, is supposed to persuade anyone that socialism is a bad idea. Capitalism has its own enforcers too, bailiffs, police, army (which Churchill himself used to break strikes, don't forget). He also manages to completely miss the concept of anarcho-syndicalism, and the fact that under capitalism people are effectively told where to work, except they are told by market forces rather than democratic decision. In a command economy there would be just as much choice for the vast majority as to where to work.",

You might want to look around someday. I was born in Maimonides Hospital. Mount Sinai is one of the premier hospitals in the world. National Jewish in Denver is the country's leading respiratory care hospital.\n \n BTW #2, charity demeans both the giver and the recipient.\nThe role of the federal government is to maintain the union of states, protect the individual freedoms of the people and provide common infrastructure and vehicles for interstate commerce, to represent this country in the global society and promote the welfare of its people.\n \n The role of our government is NOT to give away free rides to those who choose not to work.\n \n \n \n \nA few things:\n \n 1.

   "Venezuelans have far better access to healthcare now than they did before Chavez came to power, and Cubans get pretty good healthcare to looking at the outcomes in terms of longevity and infant mortality. \n\n \n Really?\n \n \nHealthcare in Venezuela takes turn for worse\n Many public hospitals have fallen on hard times in a nation awash in oil wealth. The childbirth death rate and cases of dengue and malaria are up, and doctors are in short supply.\n \n By Chris Kraul, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer \n April 8, 2008 \n \n CARACAS, VENEZUELA -- Grimacing from contractions, expectant mother Castuca Marino had more on her mind than birth pangs. She was nervous about whether she and her newborn child would make it out of the hospital alive.\n \n Interviewed as she stood in the emergency room of Concepcion Palacios Maternity Hospital here last week, Marino had heard news reports of six infant deaths there over a 24-hour period late last month. She knew that since the beginning of February, six mothers had died in the hospital during or after childbirth.\n \n Venezuela to nationalize cement sector \n Questions about Venezuela as Rice arrives in Brazil\n \"What are poor people going to do?\" said Marino, 20, as she was being admitted to this sprawling complex where, on average, 60 babies are born a day. \"I'm just hoping that there are no complications and that everything goes well.\"\n \n Palacios, Venezuela's largest public maternity hospital and once the nation's beacon of neonatal care, has fallen on hard times. Half of the anesthesiologists and pediatricians on staff two years ago have quit. Basic equipment such as respirators, ultrasound monitors and incubators are either broken or scarce. Six of 12 birth rooms have been shut.\n \n On one day last month, five newborns were crowded into one incubator, said Dr. Jesus Mendez Quijada, a psychiatrist and Palacios staff member who is a past president of the Venezuelan Medical Federation.\n \n The deaths of the six infants \"were not a case of bad luck, but the consequence of an accumulation of circumstances that have created this alarming situation,\" Mendez said.\n \n He and others say the problems at Concepcion Palacios are symptoms of a variety of ills that have beset the public healthcare system under leftist firebrand President Hugo Chavez. Cases of malaria nearly doubled between 1998, the year before Chavez took office, and 2007. Incidents of dengue fever more than doubled over the same period.\n \n Poorly paid doctors regularly demonstrate at hospitals from Puerto La Cruz in the northeast to Maracay in the industrial heartland, demanding back pay and protesting the lack of equipment and supplies. Others are leaving in droves for Spain, Australia or the Middle East, where they make 10 times the $600 monthly average salary they earn in public hospitals.\n \n Venezuela's healthcare system was facing problems even before Chavez took office. The system has been riven with corruption, mismanagement and disorganization for decades. In addition, tropical conditions have made the country ripe for epidemics difficult for any government to control. An encephalitis outbreak in 1996 sickened 20,000 people.\n \n But the system's current crisis comes as the country is awash in oil wealth, a windfall that critics say could be used to ease the problem. Instead, Chavez is building a parallel health program called Barrio Adentro, which features 11,000 neighborhood clinics staffed mainly by Cuban doctors.\n \n Inaugurated nationwide in 2003, Barrio Adentro initially was so popular with the poor that it helped Chavez win a crucial 2004 referendum and hold on to power. It has brought basic healthcare to the barrios, providing free exams and medicine as well as eye operations that have saved the sight of thousands.\n \n But the system siphons resources and equipment away from the public hospitals, which have four-fifths of the nation's 45,000 hospital beds and where the public still goes for emergency and maternity care, as well as for most major and elective surgeries.\n \n The finances and organization of Barrio Adentro are \"a black box and not transparent, so it's impossible to analyze it for efficiency,\" said Dr. Marino Gonzalez, professor of public policy at Simon Bolivar University in Caracas, the capital.\n \n A lack of openness has affected other facets of public health too. After the medical establishment blamed him for an outbreak of dengue fever last summer, Chavez halted weekly publication of an epidemiology report that for 50 years had tallied occurrences of infectious diseases nationwide.\n \n Former Health Minister Rafael Orihuela says the loss of the weekly report has deprived the government of information needed for a quick response to outbreaks of disease.\n \n \"I am not talking about a failure of the government to adopt innovations in healthcare,\" said Orihuela, a Chavez critic. \"I am talking about a failure to maintain basic healthcare standards.\"\n \n Chavez has also been accused of appointing cronies to manage public health. Efforts to arrange an interview with Minister of Popular Power for Health Jesus Mantilla, who served with Chavez in the military, were unsuccessful last week.\n \n Politics and polarization fuel the healthcare debate. Depending on who is speaking, Venezuela is either suffering from the pangs of a new dawn in socialist healthcare or from the monumental incompetence of top-level bureaucrats.\n \n But even government officials acknowledge the public health system in recent months has been on the verge of collapse, evidenced by problems in maternity and postnatal care.\n \n Since the mid-1990s, the death rate of women giving birth has risen 18%, to 59 in every 100,000 deliveries, according to UNICEF. That's four times the rate in Chile. Venezuela's infant mortality rate of 18 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 2007 was down from 20.5 in 1998, but still double the rate of Chile and higher than other Latin American countries such as Colombia, Uruguay and Costa Rica.\n \n Gonzalez, the university professor, fears that the situation could get worse because maternity hospitals such as Concepcion Palacios are having increasing difficulty finding young pediatricians to pursue neonatal specialty training due to low pay and lack of resources.\n \n \"It's not that before Chavez things were great,\" he said. \"It's that things have deteriorated.\"\n\n \n And...it is well known that Cuba also has one of the highest rates of abortion in Latin America. Many high risk pregnancies are terminated, which in turn will reduce the infant mortality rate. \n \n I know 3 people who left Cuba and came to the US. Not one of them had much positive to say about Cuba, including it's healthcare. Interestingly enough, one of them was a cardiologist. They all related the same things to me...that Cuba has a healthcare system that is readily available to those with money, and especially to outsiders bringing dollars into the country, however limited availability exists for the poor. I have been to Havana...not what I would call a great society by any means. There are some very beautiful areas in Havana, and the Cuban people themselves are fantastic. It is appaling however to see the poverty that many Cubans call home. There are whole neighborhoods that are barely more than cardboard shanty's. Access to many advanced treatments and medications is limited, and Cuban healthcare has been supplemented by a vast black market healthcare trade.",

Are you now advocating cutting government spending instead? I agree that Iraq is a waste of time, money, and lives. For all I care, if they desire to keep killing each other...have at it. But cutting the non-war defense budget would probably not be exactly a great idea. We still have many enemies that want to make us dead. \n \n \nI find it pathetic that you consider taxation to be a penalty, but, then again, that's been the common lament of every right winger who has ever drawn breath in the USA going back to the days of the Whiskey Rebellion.
