   "I heard a while ago that Turkey is seeking alternative power sources and is planning to construct between three and five nuclear power plants to avoid future energy shortfalls. That's real good for Turkey but have they really forgotten that Turkey straddles seismic fault lines and is highly prone to earthquakes? Furthermore, numerous Kurdish and Chechen terrorists are hiding in there and will surely find a nuclear plant a soft target. Considering that Turkey is longing for the EU membership, I think it will be sensible if European Parliament would let Ankara know that she'd better wash out this risky plan once she's expecting to join the EU. I think, Turkey should follow the lead of Lithuania - it pledged to close its Ignalina plant as part of its negotiations to join the European Union.",
