   "I find it most ironic that the 'church' didn't invent marriage, but rather it was an invention of politics. Now the 'church' wants politics to stay out of marriage altogether. As if they invented it. \n \n Families, childbirth...both concepts preceded marriage by thousands of years.\n Only once humans became political and power hungry did marriage play an integral role. Marriage was a political strategy to gain power, money and land. Only much later on did the church come into play and suddenly humans got the romantic notion that marriage was somehow invented by some supernatural event. \n Now we skip to present day here in this country and people simply can't understand the idea of marriage being a political issue.",

   "Can you imagine having to go through an elaborate ceremony with your partner and children and all pledge to become a family for now and the sweet hereafter?\n \n I can't either. \n \n So why do it for marriage? \n \n Marriage ceremonies are like adoption ceremonies, statements establishing responsibilities, a form of contract or committment. \n \n They exist to promote trust and mutual committment between people by artificially increasing the penalties of violating that trust and committment that such violation naturally incurs. \n \n But if the trust and committment between possible members of families is dynamic, and it is easier to accomodate the diversity and complexity that the bond of family entails than it is to resist that transition by adhering to a more narrowly defined definition of marriage, then treating man-woman marriage as the only legally valid form of partnership is insufficient to the principle that we value highly all forms of trust, committment, and even love. \n \n Why think otherwise except to satisfy a doctrinal theological concern for the immortality of something more valuable than the good of society, called a \"soul\"? \n \n Except that doing so in the United States might constitute the State enforcing an alien religion upon members of its populus... \n \n So then why should those who have made that committment in their hearts be denied the opportunity to have that committment recognized by the community? \n \n They shouldn't, since the point of marriage and similar ceremonies is to promote committments to each other in civic society. \n \n The thing I find really amusing here is that this is front to a greater conflict in our culture, between those who want to maintain family bonds wherein you value the members of your family more highly than non-members, and those who want to discard family bonds in favour of something less tribal- and more civic-minded.\n \n Forgive me, but I personally would like to move out of the fortresses, the enclaves, and the ghettos and get on with contributing to the City of God.",
