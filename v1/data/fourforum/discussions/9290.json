   "Despite the headlines and sound bites, the housing bust is not upon us. In fact, the housing bubble hasn't yet stopped growing.\n \n I'll again use OFHEO's HPI data to prove this point. (I'll refer to the 51 states since DC receives its own measure.) I calculated the average year-over-year HPI growth for each state, but only from 1975 through 2002. The housing bubble began in 2003, so the average should be based on pre-2003 data. I then calculated the year-over-year growth in HPI for each state based on 3Q2006 data. As of 3Q2006:\n [*]36 states experienced YoY growth greater than their historic averages.[*]26 states experienced YoY growth greater than 150% of their historic averages.[*]15 states experienced YoY growth greater than 200% of their historic averages.[*]9 states experienced YoY growth greater than 250% of their historic averages.[*]3 states experienced YoY growth greater than 300% of their historic averages.\n Idaho, growing at more than 300% of its historic average, has recently experienced explosive price growth but overall is not terribly inflated, yet. Arizona and Florida are still growing at more than 300% of their historic averages, which is not surprising because these are among the most inflated markets. As I've said before, it takes a long time for the housing market to correct, and AZ and FL are having a difficult time slowing down. Making predictions is dangerous, but I'm willing to bet that AZ and FL will experience the most severe effects of the housing correction. The degree of speculation in these two states has set the stage for disastrous corrections.\n \n Although the correction hasn't arrived, the slow down is underway. As a point of reference, here are the same statistics as above based on YoY growth as of 3Q2005:\n [*]48 states experienced YoY growth greater than their historic averages.[*]34 states experienced YoY growth greater than 150% of their historic averages.[*]22 states experienced YoY growth greater than 200% of their historic averages.[*]13 states experienced YoY growth greater than 250% of their historic averages.[*]8 states experienced YoY growth greater than 300% of their historic averages.\n The slow down is significant, but with the exception of poor Michigan, no state has yet displayed a YoY decline in absolute home prices.\n \n The bust has not yet started.\n \n Jeff\n \n http://home-economics-us.blogspot.com",

   "I sometimes get the feeling that I'm only finding the negative housing data, and ignoring the positive data. I looked for the positive data this week, and I couldn't find any...\n \n Today I added the following to my analysis:\n \n \n The housing slow down is significant, but with the exception of poor Michigan, no state has yet displayed a YoY decline in median price since 2Q2000.\n \n In fact, the data becomes absurd when assessing HPI contractions. No state experienced a YoY decline in median price from 3Q2000 to 2Q2006, representing 24 consecutive quarters of positive YoY median price growth for every state. Before 3Q2000, median YoY price contractions occurred in 6.5 states per quarter on average. That is, an average of 6.5 states normally experience YoY median price contractions each quarter, but we just witnessed 24 consecutive quarters without one median price contraction. Holy XXXX.\n \n The bust has not yet started.\n \n \n Jeff",

   "It's not the housing market that we have to worry about crashing. It's the crash of the dollar that will cause wide spread economic pain. \n Will home prices fall faster then the dollar will? I don't know, but I beat the dollar will fall more then the home prices. But that kind of depends on the Fed's response, if they raise the rates then the home prices will drop faster, but if they drop the rates then we're all doomed. OK maybe not doomed, but inflation would be even worse if they drop the rates. \n I for one hope the dollar value of my home drops. My house has increased in value so much in the last 3 years that the property taxes have increased $2500 a year! That's a lot of green. I bought my cheap house but this god damn inflation has me paying almost as much taxes as I am paying to the mortgage every year.emoticon_wow",
