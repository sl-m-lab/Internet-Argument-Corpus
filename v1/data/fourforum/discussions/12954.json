   "QUESTION: WHAT'S worse than a federal agency that lacks the quorum of commissioners necessary to act on a matter? Answer: An agency that has a quorum in place but is paralyzed from acting anyway because it is deadlocked along party lines.\n \n Such is the sad situation at the Federal Election Commission, which spent the first half of 2008 -- which, you may recall, was an election year -- unable to bring any enforcement actions because of the lack of a quorum. Those are now looking like the good old days. Now, with the full complement of six commissioners in place, the FEC appears to be even more dysfunctional than usual, which is saying something. ...The three Republican appointees are turning the commission into The Little Agency That Wouldn't: wouldn't launch investigations, wouldn't bring cases, wouldn't even accept settlements that the staff had already negotiated. This is not a matter of partisan politics. These commissioners simply appear not to believe in the law they have been entrusted with enforcing. \n \n The latest episode was revealed this month when two Democratic commissioners, Ellen L. Weintraub and Cynthia L. Bauerly, issued a statement about the commission's 3-3 deadlock over approving a settlement involving a 2006 California congressional seat. \"This may be the most inexplicable resolution of a Matter Under Review that we have seen during our combined tenures on the Commission,\" they began. \n\n Deadlocked in Regulation - washingtonpost.com\n \n Hmmm, now let's see... what other kind of irregularities:\n \nControversial actions by the FEC include:\n \n * Allowing Norm Coleman to use his campaign funds to defend himself against allegations that a long-time associate steered some $100,000 to him through a company that employed his wife.\n \n * Voting against investigating allegations that Wal-Mart had store managers give presentations to staff claiming that the Employee Free Choice Act would hurt Wal-Mart workers and would become law if Democrats won Congress and the White House in 2008. In some cases, the managers also reportedly attacked then-candidate Barack Obama.\n \n * Issuing an advisory opinion that allows Rep. Pete Visclosky (D-IN) to use campaign funds to pay legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with an ongoing federal investigation.\n \n * Issuing an advisory opinion that allows Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R-TX) to use his family's yacht for campaign events to raise money to finance his re-election.\n \n The FEC commissioners' failure to take their oversight mission seriously threatens to undermine campaign finance laws and further flood the electoral process with money. With a lack of campaign finance oversight, political influence on Capitol Hill is bought by the highest bidder and the common good is sacrificed to special interests.\n\n From CREW (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington):\n FEC Complaints | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington",

   "Tisk, tisk... Two can play that game. (Of course, a 'hopelessly deadlocked' govt. might be the best thing that could happen to us, but in the interest of debate, let's hash it about a bit)\n \n First, let's see why was the FEC hobbled in the first place...\n \n \nSenate Democrats had refused for a year to confirm von Spakovsky, torpedoing the nominations of three other nominees and denying the FEC a quorum. Since Jan. 1, only two of the agency's six commissioner slots have been filled. Bush, supported by GOP Senate leaders, had refused to withdraw von Spakovsky's name. \n\n \n Contested Nominee To FEC Drops Out - washingtonpost.com\n \n \n Now as to....\n \n \n \nThe latest episode was revealed this month when two Democratic commissioners, Ellen L. Weintraub and Cynthia L. Bauerly, issued a statement about the commission's 3-3 deadlock over approving a settlement involving a 2006 California congressional seat. \"This may be the most inexplicable resolution of a Matter Under Review that we have seen during our combined tenures on the Commission,\" they began. \n\n \n \n This particular case involves...\n \n \n \nAn unsuccessful Democratic candidate, Arjinderpal Sekhon, had failed to disclose the occupation or employer for most of his contributors, as required by law, then failed to fix the faulty reports when repeatedly asked to do so by the FEC. \n\n \n \n Let's be clear that this is a Democrat for starters. Why would the Republicians NOT persue a Democrat cheater? I don't know... could be its because he lost anyway and isn't worth the $$$ to go after or any number of reasons. But I find it funny that the Republicans are made to look worse than the Democrat that broke the rules in the first place.\n \n \n Now in the interest of fair and balanced reporting...\n \n \nControversial actions by the FEC include: \n * Allowing Norm Coleman to use his campaign funds to defend himself against allegations that a long-time associate steered some $100,000 to him through a company that employed his wife.\n\n \n In this case (which I'm not familiar with) he will either be found guilty or innocent. If he is found innocent (which we're supposed to assume, correct?) then it was perfectly fine for him to use campaign $$$ to clear his name of campaign violations. If he is found guilty, then I'm sure he'll be made to pay restitution.\n \n BTW...I don't remember hearing you calling for Hillary to use her own money to pay for her campaign problems. Or, more egregiously, how about John Edwards?\n \n \n \n* Voting against investigating allegations that Wal-Mart had store managers give presentations to staff claiming that the Employee Free Choice Act would hurt Wal-Mart workers and would become law if Democrats won Congress and the White House in 2008. In some cases, the managers also reportedly attacked then-candidate Barack Obama.\n\n \n Are you kidding me? An employeer can't have a meeting with its employees to explain their POV on an issue? Hell, at least Wal-mart is private sector. The Employee \"Free Choice\" act's main tenent is to take away the secret ballot, lmao! \n \n \n* Issuing an advisory opinion that allows Rep. Pete Visclosky (D-IN) to use campaign funds to pay legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with an ongoing federal investigation.\n\n \n \n Humm... they said a Republican can use campaign $$$ to pay legal fees THEN they say a Democrat....can do the same thing. Wow, how ridiculously consistent!\n \n \n \n* Issuing an advisory opinion that allows Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R-TX) to use his family's yacht for campaign events to raise money to finance his re-election.\n\n \n Why wouldn't a person be able to use something they own to do something they want? Didn't Obama have meetings in his house back in the day to get his first couple of campaigns going? Should we call for investigations into that?\n \n \n \n By no means am I excusing Pubs or Dems from wrong doing. I think large portions of both sides have turned into completely intolerable, horrid, hypocritical, liars. However, such blatant spin and partisanship diminishes any point you may have about gridlock. Also, just to balance the scales I'll conclude with one word on elections...\n \n ACORN.",

   "Hah! Hans von Spakovsky!\n \n I'll Hans von Spakovsky you! von Spakovsky! The Devil behind voter disenfranchisement!\n \n Here's a rundown on what that Devil did during the Bush administration:\n \nVon Spakovsky, a longtime activist in the voting-integrity cause, has emerged as the Administration's chief operative on voting rights. Before going to Washington, he was a lawyer in private practice and a Republican appointee to the Fulton County Registration and Election Board, which runs elections in Atlanta. He belonged to the Federalist Society, a prominent organization of conservative lawyers, and had also joined the board of advisers of a lesser-known group called the Voting Integrity Project.\n \n The V.I.P. was founded by Deborah Phillips, a former county official of the Virginia Republican Party, as an organization devoted principally to fighting voting fraud and promoting voter education. In 1997, von Spakovsky wrote an article for the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a conservative research group, that called for an aggressive campaign to \"purge\" the election rolls of felons. Within months of that article's publication, the V.I.P. helped put von Spakovsky's idea into action. Phillips met with the company that designed the process for the removal of alleged felons from the voting rolls in Florida, a process that led, notoriously, to the mistaken disenfranchisement of thousands of voters, most of them Democratic, before the 2000 election.\n\n TPMmuckraker | Talking Points Memo | Voter Suppression Showdown, Round 2: Von Spakovsky\n \n Dear CUNx, I concede that your advanced age of 122 renders you a bit senile once in a while, but surely you have not forgotten what happened to voters in Florida in 2000 under the aegis of that harridan Katherine Harris:\n \nBefore the election, a firm hired by Harris in her capacity as Secretary of State to purge convicted felons from the voter rolls erroneously removed 8,000 registered voters who had been convicted only of misdemeanors, thousands of others who had the same names as felons, and a few whose computer records said they had committed crimes in the future. This led to her being nicknamed the Purge Princess.\n\n Katherine Harris - SourceWatch",

That's their JOB, just as its the Pubs job to attempt to block people they think are wrong for an appointment. But neither side can have it both ways.
