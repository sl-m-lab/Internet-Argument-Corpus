He was also a philanthropist and donated land and buildings to the town. This sort of paternalism was not the norm but was far from uncommon in the 19th century. Cadbury, Rowntree, Titus Salt were more famous examples of a similar attitude, to the extent that they provided better accommodation for their workers, paid for education and recreational activities.

However, it was separated from the western wing by 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) across India. Political and linguistic discrimination as well as economic neglect led to popular agitations against West Pakistan, which led to the war for independence in 1971 and the establishment of Bangladesh. After independence the new state endured famines, natural disasters and widespread poverty, as well as political turmoil and military coups. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by relative stability and economic progress.\n \n Bangladesh is the seventh most populous country in the world and is among the most densely populated countries in the world with a high poverty rate. However, per-capita (inflation-adjusted) GDP has more than doubled since 1975, and the poverty rate has fallen by 20% since the early 1990s. The country is listed among the \"Next Eleven\" economies.
