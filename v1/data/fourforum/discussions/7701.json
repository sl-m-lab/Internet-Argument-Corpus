   "The recent cartoons stir has made it clear for many that inciting religious and ethnic hatreds amount to a suicide. I guess it'll take more time to pacify infuriated Muslims. Well, amid this ominous background Stockholm officials are behaving like mentally handicapped people or provocateurs perhaps. The Chechen terrorists 'mass media outlet' Kavkaz-Center site hosted by Sweden has joined the campaign to 'rebuff Muslim drive' following the scandal with caricatures. They are engaged in spreading Holocaust cartoons now! Muslims are European enemy and Jews are going to be such if we keep ignoring such wild things! If it goes this way Europe will soon have no say in the Middle East. We'll be just squeezed out of the vital region. Is that our big plan? My idea is that such sites inspiring religious intolerance and propagating radical Islam and violence must be banned immediately in European territories!",

It will rear it's head in some other way eventually. ie.. war, violence, ect.",

I think the difference is that the clergy we're listening to don't tell people to go firebomb buildings and blow ourselves up in crowded places. The difference between Islam and Christianity is that the core beliefs of the two religions are radically different. Christianity has mostly peaceful core beliefs. That doesn't mean they have historically always been followed, but those core teachings are there.",
