   "The United Nations charter specifies two situations under which a country can go to war: To repel an attack in self-defense (as specified in article 51) or as part of a security council resolution (as specified in article 43). The United States went to war without either of these conditions. There was no attack against the United States by Iraq, which makes war under article 51 impossible. Also, there was no security council resolution specifically allowing war, which makes war under article 43 impossible. Therefore, the US has gone to war illegally.",

   "War isn't based on what is right or wrong. Saddam wasn't abiding to disarmament procedures for eleven years. Suffice to say, we tried to gain approval from the UN, though it was an effort of vain. \n \n Iraq was said to have weapons of mass destruction, though it might not seem like an immediate threat to someone in direct oil trade relations with Iraq (i.e. The UN emoticon_rolleyes ), it was an effort to thwart inevitable future attacks and replace a dictator no better than Hitler himself.\n \n Not to mention, the UN laws aren't exactly standard policy if you know what I mean. I believe it can exist, is the org. that makes it can enforce their own laws, mandates, resolutions whatever. The UN has a bad habit of not enforcing those rules and it's reallly a shame since it has the potency to be a really good thing however when it comes to international law there are a few problems, which I would like to address.\n \n 1: For international law to exist, their has to be a world govt. or laws are overlooked. Take say the NVA for instance during the French occupation of Indochina when the UN was in it's early stage. The NVA were executing any and all French troops they captured, a clear violation of the Geneva convention however the UN did nothing about it. Instead the French came to us to resolve the situation for them. Another example is the mass slaughter of the Cambodians shortly after the US withdrawl of Vietnam, 2 million Cambodians were slaughtered and the UN didn't as much as acknowledge the incident. I can cite many example from countless countries however the point is that the UN cannot enforce their rules if: the world is not united in a world govt. or they don't have the backbone to do it.\n \n 2: The diversity of multi-international politics into one forum can only mean one thing: Nothing will really get done. It's the same way in our congress, if the senate or house is split then nothing will ever get done becuase the main majorities of politics collide and thus the debates never end. Now that our govt. is mainly conservative a lot of stuff is getting done, like during the Carter admin. when the house, senate and exec staff were all democrat a lot of stuff got done as well... although I think they hurt us more but that's a different arguement for another time.\n \n 3: The incorporation of not-so-good guys into the UN. Now I'm not talking about France, Germany or Russia. I'm talking about those countries that commit atrocities under the UN's nose and get away with it. Lybia, Rwunda, Somolia etc. This way they can block or intervein with certain laws that might make their friends like Iraq get into trouble so they'll do whatever they can to hinder the operation.\n \n Oh, and just because I feel like it. How many of you are willing to subjugate yourselves to the international justices set forth by an organization who, in its declaration of human rights, states, \"These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\" (Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 29, Section 3).\n \n So basically, you have all the rights specified in the document up until they begin to undermine the U.N.'s rule. Let's you know who numero uno is under their system, eh?\n \n Look at the difference between this and the United States' constitution. In this, it declares itself supreme to the people and that they can in no way work to undermine its purposes. The Constitution says the explicit opposite, ensuring those rights to the people under no restrictions. It even goes so far as to say that the rights enumerated within cannot be used to deprive people of rights that aren't explicity stated, then goes on to say all other powers and rights should go to the people or lower-level governments, rather than itself.\n \n Edit: Oh, and Section 2 of the same document states, \"In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.\" So once again, we have another \"except\" clause. I understand the first half...it merely states that your rights can be abridged if they violate others' rights, but look at how ambiguous the second statement in the clause is. You only have the rights forementioned if they abide by unspecified standards of decency and morality. Who's left to interpret those standards? Why, the United Nations, of course!",

   "\"War isn't based on what is right or wrong.\"\n Yes it is. War is based on what each country feels is right. However, the topic of this debate is, \"The war with Iraq is [not] legal.\" The goal is to determine whether the US and UK and its allies committed crimes by an invasion of Iraq.\n \n \"Saddam wasn't abiding to disarmament procedures for eleven years.\"\n How do we know. We never gave the inspectors enough time to find out.\n \n \"Suffice to say, we tried to gain approval from the UN, though it was an effort of vain.\"\n Maybe members of the UN wanted more time.

I don't know if I will go as far and say that he is no better than Hitler, but he is a bad man. However, once again, the debate is whether or not the war is LEGAL. You can't shoot your neighbor because he is a bad man; we shouldn't be able to remove Saddam solely because he is a bad man.",

   "Originally posted by wjim1269 \n \n I never heard of any WMD being found anywhere in Iraq since inspectors returned. \n Al Samoud 2 missiles have already qualfied as weapons of mass destruction as have these:\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,83449,00.html\n \n As have all of the procedures reguarding disarmament been violated:\n \n \n\n The following is the text of a State Department fact sheet summarizing findings of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) report on Unresolved Disarmament Issues relating to Iraq, presented to the U.N. Security Council on March 7, 2003:\n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,80892,00.html\n \n This fact sheet carefully reviews UNMOVIC's report (the \"Cluster Document\") delivered on March 7, 2003 before the U.N. Security Council concerning the Iraqi government and its refusal to carry out full and complete disarmament of its weapons of mass destruction. \n \n The report demonstrates that Iraq and its leadership have pursued a consistent strategy of concealing its weapons of mass destruction and deceiving inspectors in direct violation of its international obligations. Iraq's weapons of mass destruction remain a direct and active threat to their neighbors and to the international community.\n \n History Repeats Itself: Iraq's Strategy To Deny, Deceive and Conceal Continues\n \n \u0095 UNMOVIC's document lays bare that Iraq's strategy today has not changed. Inspectors are faced with deception, concealment and changing stories.\n \n \u0095 Inspectors discovered that Iraq failed to declare an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle that is based on a system that Iraq admitted to UNSCOM was intended to deliver chemical or biological agent.\n \n \u0095 Inspectors discovered cluster bombs and sub munitions that appeared designed to deliver chemical or biological agents. Contrary to initial Iraqi statements, a number of bombs and over 100 sub munitions were found.\n \n \u0095 Iraq has failed to provide inspectors with supplier information about foreign-procured items. These items include gyroscopes, chemicals and laboratory equipment - all apparent weapons of mass destruction-dual-use items.\n \n \u0095 Iraq claims that a 50-ton trailer that it illegally imported for use as a missile launcher was \"stolen.\" This is the same \"stolen\" story that Iraq has used in the past for weapons of mass destruction items such as biological growth media.\n \n \u0095 UNMOVIC has concluded that documents Iraq provided regarding production of botulinum toxin and Iraq's capability to dry biological weapon agents provided no new information. Just the same, tired story Iraq told UNSCOM.\n \n Iraq's History Of Denial, Deception And Concealment\n \n \u0095 On nearly 30 occasions, Iraq refused - despite repeated requests from the international community - to provide credible evidence to substantiate its claims that they do not possess arms or have disarmed fully and completely.\n \n \u0095 The document cites 17 instances when inspectors uncovered evidence directly contradicting Iraqi claims of innocence.\n \n \u0095 Iraq has admitted numerous attempts to mislead inspectors by lying or planting false evidence during the inspection process.\n \n \u0095 Time and again, Iraq successfully concealed its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs from the earlier inspection teams (UNSCOM) - only changing its story in order to fit the facts. For example:\n \n \u0095 Only in 1995 did Iraq declare its offensive biological weapons program, after publicly denying its existence for four years.\n \n \u0095 Only in 1997 did inspectors discover evidence of production completed on prohibited missiles in 1992.\n \n \u0095 Only in 1997 did Iraq declare an additional 187 pieces of specialty equipment used to produce deadly chemical agents.\n \n \u0095 Only in 2003 when confronted by inspectors, did Iraq turn over the \"Iraqi Air Force\" document that contradicts Iraq's chemical weapons declaration - by disclosing an additional 6,500 bombs with 1,000 tons of the blistering agent mustard gas.\n \n \u0095 This document makes clear that Iraq has the inherent capability to manufacture chemical and biological weapons and literally tens of thousands of delivery systems (missiles, munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles).\n \n Additional Examples of Iraq's Strategy of Deception and Concealment:\n \n Anthrax\n \n \u0095 After lying for four years, Iraq admitted in 1995 to producing nearly 8,500 liters of anthrax.\n \n \u0095 Furthermore, the Iraqi's noted that only one facility was involved in the production of anthrax and that none of the biological agent was produced in 1991. Moreover, Iraq said it filled 50 R-400 bombs and five missile warheads with anthrax.\n \n \u0095 UNMOVIC's report recollects UNSCOM's conclusions:\n \n \u0095 Iraq's anthrax production potential could have been as much as 25,000 liters.\n \n \u0095 Evidence that a second facility produced anthrax in 1991.\n \n \u0095 Evidence that more than five warheads were filled with anthrax.\n \n \u0095 That there is no reliable or final assessment of how many R-400 bombs were filled with anthrax.\n \n \u0095 UNMOVIC concludes:\n \n \u0095 About 10,000 additional liters of anthrax were not destroyed and may still exist.\n \n \u0095 \"Iraq currently possesses the technology and materials...to enable it to produce anthrax.\"\n \n \u0095 By 1993, Iraq was successfully drying large quantities of a bacteria that \"could be a model for anthrax.\"\n \n \u0095 As the Secretary noted on February 5, Iraq has developed a mobile biological agent production capability. In only one month's time, these mobile units can produce the same, or more, dry anthrax equivalent to the 10,000 liters Iraq has hidden from inspectors.\n \n VX\n \n \u0095 Iraq's Chemical Weapons declarations in April 1991 and June 1992 did not disclose Iraq's VX program. Only in March 1995 did Iraq admit to having produced large-scale amounts of VX - one of the most dangerous chemical agents created.\n \n \u0095 Iraq claims never to have successfully weaponized VX.\n \n \u0095 UNMOVIC's document concludes:\n \n \u0095 Iraq provided false and misleading declarations in order to retain production equipment specifically modified to produce VX.\n \n \u0095 Direct physical evidence contradicts Iraq's claim that it never weaponized VX.\n \n \u0095 Iraq failed to provide any credible evidence to support its claims of unilateral destruction of VX and VX precursors.\n \n \u0095 UN inspectors reported to the UN Security Council that \"UNMOVIC has information that conflicts with [Iraq's] account. There are indications that Iraq had worked on the problems of purity and stabilization and that more had been achieved than has been declared.\"\n \n R-400 Bombs\n \n \u0095 Iraq first claimed it had 1,200 R-400 chemical bombs.\n \n \u0095 After Iraq admitted its biological weapons program in 1995, Iraq altered its story and added 350 R-400 bombs.\n \n \u0095 However, UNSCOM has never fully verified Iraq's ever-changing claims and concluded it did not know how many R-400 bombs Iraq produced for chemical/biological agents.\n \n \u0095 Of these 1,550 bombs, Iraq says it filled 157 with biological agents. Nothing supports that number. UNSCOM concluded it did not know how many Iraq filled with biological weapons.\n \n \u0095 Iraq claims today that newly-found bombs and bomb fragments add up close to 157 and that, therefore, the issue of R-400 biological bombs can be closed.\n \n \u0095 Regrettably, the fact is that Iraq has refused to provide a complete and accurate count on how many R-400 bombs - filled or unfilled\n \n \u0095 Iraq really has in its possession.\n \n Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Spray Devices\n \n \u0095 We now know that inspectors discovered an undeclared Unmanned Aerial Vehicle with a 7.45 meter wingspan, based on a drop tank system that Iraq admitted was intended to disperse biological agent, has apparent autonomous flight capability and appears to have the capability to fly more than 150 kilometers.\n \n \u0095 This type of discovery is only the latest chapter in Iraq's effort to hide the fact that it has worked for years to develop Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and spray devices to deliver chemical and biological agent.\n \n \u0095 Only in 1996 did Iraq admit trying to convert the MiG-21 fighter aircraft into an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to deliver a biological weapon agent. Then, Iraq changed its story and claimed that the MiG-21 would deliver a \"munition.\"\n \n \u0095 On spray tanks, UNMOVIC concludes, \"there is a clear contradiction in Iraq's explanation of...spray tanks.\" Contrary to Iraq's declaration, Iraq has \"a well-developed drop-tank for [a] chemical agent.\"\n \n \u0095 UNMOVIC states, \"The development of tanks for chemical weapons and biological weapons uses should...be considered...one continued project...Spraying devices modified for chemical/biological weapon purposes may still exist in Iraq.\"\n \n \u0095 Iraq has pursued several other Unmanned Aerial Vehicles - the L-29 jet trainer and smaller aircraft - all capable of using spray devices to deliver a chemical/biological agent.\n \n \u0095 UNMOVIC's basic conclusion: a \"general question of Iraq's intentions with respect to remote-piloted vehicles as chemical/biological delivery systems...\"\n \n SCUD-Type Biological and Chemical Warheads\n \n \u0095 UNMOVIC's document states: \"A number of discrepancies and questions remain which raise doubts about accounting of special warheads, including:\n \n \u0095 The total number produced [100 warheads, not 75] ...\n \n \u0095 Iraq's numerous modifications to its declarations on these matters.\n \n \u0095 Iraq's admitted action taken to mislead UNSCOM on the location and number of special warheads.\n \n \u0095 And most importantly, the physical evidence which conflicts with Iraq's account of its destruction of biological warheads...\"\n \n \u0095 This issue is important because special warheads are \"linked to the wider issue of whether Iraq had retained Scud-type missiles, propellant and a launching capability after the declared destruction.\"\n",

   "Though I have fought and fought some more, there is nothing stating in paper that this war was \"legally\" right. I can only merely defend the US by saying that the UN's asnine tyrants regarding the US violation of the charter is all but legitimate. \n \n As I have said before, the UN failed to defend it's policy in the past, and only defends as it sees fit. Had the UN actually done it's job in the first place and not ignored it's own laws, this whole thing could have been prevented. Suffice to say, the UN neither carried out it's own policy until it seemed fit, which happened to fall on an unfortunate time for the US considering it had to follow through with the UN's OWN disarmament procedures. Isn't that consistency for ya?\n\n \n I will agree that the UN needs some work and some changes, but going to war on the POSSIBILITY of a threat should not be allowed. We THINK he had WMD. We THINK he could attack an ally. We didn't KNOW any of this. There's no PROOF. Weapons inspectors were not allowed enough time to inspect before they were called out so that the US could invade.",

SADDAM IS A LYING, DECITFUL, ROTTEN MAN AND HONESTLY, THE WORLD IS PROBABLY BETTER WITH HIM OUT OF POWER. However, the US and UK did not go through the proper channels with this. According to the UN charter, article 41:\n \nno member state has the right to enforce any resolution militarily unless the UN Security Council determines that there has been a material breach of its resolution, decides that all nonmilitary means of enforcement have been exhausted, and then specifically authorizes the use of military force.\n \n Yes, there has been a material breach of the UN resolutions, but nonmilitary means of enforcement have not been exahausted, and no resolution has authorized military force.\n \n If the US is allowed to invade Iraq because of Iraq's violation of UN resolutions, then look at the other wars that could soon take place:\n - Russia could claim the right to invade Israel\n - France could claim the right to invade Turkey\n - Great Britain could claim the right to invade Morocco\n This according to Foreign Policy in Focus, click here to read the entire document.",

You know the topic cold, and provide some compelling argumentation all throughout. Make sure your arguments are topical though (I'll get to that in the RFD)\n WJim:\n You looked like you were on your heels at times, but good job holding him to the topic. You only won one issue, but it was key.\n Reason for Decision:\n I vote for WJim. Basically, Divest makes compelling points on why Iraq is bad, why it is dangerous, why it is evil, why international law sucks and even why the war is necessary. Great. That has nothing to do with legality, and Divest doesn't really make any point on what DOES make the war legal, especially with regards to the UN charter obligations. He claims that int'l law doesn't apply, but\n 1) WJim correctly points out why it does (we don't obey laws simply because we choose to) and\n 2) Divest doesn't provide any alternative standard for judging the legality of the action, so I have to go with the one presented to me.\n The debate comes down to who won what the debate topic told us to debate. Though Divest won a half-dozen periphery issues, WJim is the only one to really address the key issue of legality.\n \n Hope that helps! and next time PLEASE follow the posting guidelines!
