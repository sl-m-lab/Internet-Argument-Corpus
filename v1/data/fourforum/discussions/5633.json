Under the proposed system, no one's marriage would be recognized, and everyone would have civil unions of course.\n \n Let's also not forget that this is an issue of religious freedom for those religious officials who want to legally marry gay couples as well.\n \n It seems like a very drastic step, more drastic then letting gay couples into civil marriage. Why are we considering this, only as gay couples may be allowed into civil marriage? Would it be seriously considered by the government, only to keep gay people out of civil marriage?

   "Jake, I happen to think you are reading too much into it. Under this plan they will get the rights, and if they want to travel to a church that does allow marriage, they can get said marriage. The \"sanctity of marriage\" as, what I believe and most people believe to be, a purely religious matter will be secured.\n \n Curiously enough I think that this will allow homosexuals to become more accepted as it will cause every religion in America to consider the issue in a religious sense. Each American Protestant denomination will have a struggle and as a liberal I believe that more people will be come to see them as what they really are... human beings just trying to live their lives in a world that doesn't seem to want to understand them.\n \n I could be terribly wrong, I may be wearing rose-colored glasses, but since this whole gay marriage debate started America went from roughly 60-38 against it to being 52-48 against it. That's what I consider progress.\n \n There are other reasons for doing this, first off the most important thing is not what you want to call it, names are simply labels, the fact is that homosexuals will get their equal rights. Again, as a liberal this is extremely important because that is what America, at least to me, is all about, equality under law, fairness. \n \n Secondly, from a religious stand-point, it will \"render onto Caesar's what is Caesar's and unto God/Vishnu/Allah/etc. what is God/Vishnu/Allah/etc.\" It will support a healthy and clear separation of church and state and will empower religions in an area where they should be empowered.",

I very much respect your mother-in-law's opinion, and I agree with it. However, I do not believe that it will be the majority opinion of the church. The church will always need an enemy, and it will always try to keep itself in our government. Think of the way it disapproves of same-sex marriage today. Think of what the Pope says. They do not say that the government is interfering with their religion, they say that we are inviting immorality and anarchy into our nation. They don't want to protect their free practice of religion, they want their own religious values forced upon every American. They don't think of it like that, and they would never say it like that, but that is what they want.\n \n Think of other religious issues: removing \"In God We Trust\" from money, stopping people from swearing oaths on the Bible, stopping abortion. These are not cases of the church defending its institutions against change, they are cases of the church trying keep its influence and its values in our government. What will help even less is that if the idea of replacing marriage with civil unions for everyone is introduced, every single gay rights organization will immediately get behind the idea. And when the church's opponents are so enthusiastic about this idea, the church will not want it to succeed.\n \n I hate to phrase the situation as I have, but I want everyone to see things the way I do.

   "Opposition on psychological grounds? Sounds like the similar arguments that used to be made against same-sex marriage. And what if the couple is sterile, thereby negating the children issue? Sorry, but there's no difference in any other group such as this coming forward and saying \"I want benefits too\" based on their sort of relationship.\n\n \n And if those psychological arguments against same-sex marriage held any reasonable ground, we should absolutely consider them. But they simply don't. Even if they did, in homosexuality, most psychological arguments are rooted in the idea that homosexuality is a psychological defect, which is very different from the argument that legalizing incestuous marriage will encourage people to abuse psychological relationships. In one case, the legalization of marriage would encourage psychological abuse, in the other (if it actually stood against reason) simply says that those engaging in marriage have a psychological problem. In one case, legalizing marriage would cause harm, in the other, it would not.\n \n The idea that \"there's no difference in any other group such as this coming forward and saying 'I want benefits too'\" indicates that you believe same-sex marriage and incestuous marriage have the same justification for wanting benefits. I will make the claim that incestuous marriage is no more different from same-sex marriage than it is from opposite-sex marriage. If this is true, then we can again say that \"there's no difference in opposite-sex couples asking for benefits than incestuous couples asking for benefits.\"\n \n What I mean is, if there is no difference between incestuous couples marrying and same-sex couples marrying, then there is no difference between incestuous couples marrying and opposite-sex couples marrying. \n \n You seem to be saying that the only difference between these relationships is the fact that our current standard is \"opposite-sex marriage\". By that logic, it would not matter which form of marriage we currently allow, you would support that one and only that one. That does not make logical sense; surely any given current standard might could be evil.\n \n \nAgain, all these (including same-sex marriage) are simply deviations from what marriage has mostly always been considered to be.\n\n \n This further promotes the idea that our current standard cannot be wrong and that you would agree with it no matter which form of marriage was chosen. But simply keeping to whatever standard we have today will prepetuate any evils we have today. We should instead seek to fix those evils, and when I can show that a group is being treated unfairly, and there are no harms created by that lack of fairness, then we are morally evil for refusing to make things fair.\n \n You make the claim that there is no difference in any group without marriage benefits asking for them, but instead of repeating that unfounded claim, why don't you explain to me why there is no difference? Instead of saying, \"people say the same things about same-sex marriage\", think critically about the differences and figure out why my claims of the psychological harms created by incestuous marriage are invalid. I would provide that critical thinking and reasoning to oppose the claims that same-sex marriage creates psychological harm because I don't believe it creates that harm. So if you don't believe incestuous marriage creates harm, tell me why.\n \n Still, I think there is no way you can believe that \"there's no difference in any other group such as this coming forward and saying 'I want benefits too' based on their sort of relationship\" because you specifically do believe that one form of relationship is different. You believe that opposite-sex relationships deserve that benefit while other relationships do not. So why is it so difficult for you to understand my belief that both opposite-sex and same-sex relationships deserve that benefit, while other relationships do not?\n \n I'm not arguing for complete equality here. I'm arguing for as much equality as we can. I'm arguing for as much equality as makes rational sense, as much equality as doesn't cause harm, and I think that is the point you're missing.\n \n \nBut why should they be prevent from it? What if one woman can't get visitation rights to see one of her husbands? Again, same sort of thing you are arguing for. It's all the same issues. If you truly want equality in marriage, every single possibility of relationship is going to have to be covered.\n\n \n Incestuous couples don't need visitation rights; they've already got them. I do think our visitation laws need to be changed, though. Currently, even if a victim specifies people who he wants allowed to visit him, those people might not be allowed. Our law should be changed so that those people must be allowed to visit him. As for why they do not deserve all the benefits of marriage, it is as I said: to allow one many to extend his benefits to that many people is impractical. Why don't you tell me how we'll handle one person being allow to naturalize as many people as he wants? Why don't you tell me how we'll pay for health insurance and food stamps for one individual who has married ten people with twenty kids. How about the dependants in that situation? One man should not be allowed to gain the benefit of infinite family members. We should give everyone the right to extend those benefits to a single other person, and that's all that makes sense, unless you're able to answer those questions.\n \n \nThe standard of hetero marriage is simply the reality of the situation.\n \n Look around.\n\n \n Of course it is. But that standard could still be wrong.",
