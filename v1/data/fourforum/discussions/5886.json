More people in the seats=more money and they are tring to scare you into comming. Remember that if a church has to use scare tactics to get members then they do not know Jesus, who preached love and acceptance.\n \n Don't go then. You do not need to go to church to worship God. One of my favorite places is to go to the beach at sunset, where I can hear His voice. Take a ride in an airplane and see His face. Walk in the woods and feel His presence.
