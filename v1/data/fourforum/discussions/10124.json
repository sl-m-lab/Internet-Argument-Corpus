   "To be loved. That's all David Vitter wanted. Why, a staunch supporter of \"family values\" like Mr. Vitter can only do what one would expect of him, and share those cherished values with the lovely ladies of DC. He couldn't help it, Katrina chased all the good tail out of New Orleans and Lucianne Goldberg wasn't reachable by cell that night. I mean, give the guy a break! What's a man of such \"bedrock\" principles to do?\n \n Yes, Republicans and prostitutes. They go together like Ben and Jerry. Butch and Sundance. Norm Coleman and a roach clip. But there are many other of our species Republicans don't react so well to - and I'm not just talking about people who don't require greenbacks for copulation in general. Specific groups of people, like veterans, firefighters and pretty much anyone not whiter than a Klan rally in Utah during a snowstorm.\n \n http://www.americablog.com/\n \n Another take on Vitter.",

His actions were disgusting for anyone, not just a politician, and they should throw the book at him. He should also get expelled as a Representitive of the People for this Moral Terpitude. Why would you think I would make excuses for such reprehensible conduct ? I'm not a Democrat after all who defends and makes excuses for any sins committed by their Party members no matter how disgusting they are.\n \n And this is far more serious than Vitters personal indiscretion that affects him and his wife more than anyone else.

   "Kronus made an excellent post on this subject on a different thread, and I hope he'll forgive me if I post it here. emoticon_xangel \n \nThat's not actually the way politics works. Parties often put planks in their platform for the sole purpose of courting a small but powerful special interest group. The anti-gay stuff is there largely to keep the religious right, and their money, happy. There are republicans who fight against those planks, and many more who don't like them but don't really care enough to raise a fuss. Those are the republicans that need to be courted, not alienated. Once enough republicans are willing to state that they don't want discrimination to be the official party line then changes will start to happen, but that will never happen if every single republican is disregarded as being the enemy. Find the real enemies and oppose them, find the moderates and win them over. That's the only path to success.\n",

   "SUMMARY: The Florida lawmaker stripped of his committee assignments over his gay sex scandal makes an apparent slur against the state GOP's Latino leadership. \n \n Florida Rep. Bob Allen, stripped of his committee assignments this week by a House speaker seeking his resignation over his gay sex scandal, instead made more enemies with an apparent slur against Florida's Latino leadership. \n \n \"I would think this leadership more than anyone would think that we don't want to copy totalitarian governments but copy American principles,\" Allen told the Miami Herald on Wednesday in an apparent reference to House Speaker Marco Rubio being Cuban-American. \n \n Allen was forced to backpedal as yet more of his fellow Republicans called for his head. \n \n \"The fact that he's comparing the consequences of the allegations of his sexual misconduct to the plight of dissidents trapped in Castro's gulag is at best absurd and at worst insulting. He needs to go,\" Rep. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, R-Miami, told the Herald, adding that Allen's comments made him \"physically irked.\" \n \n The party leadership wants Allen to resign before his Aug. 23 arraignment on a misdemeanor charge of solicitation to commit prostitution. \n \n Even Gov. Charlie Crist weighed in, telling the Orlando Sentinel that \"I have to respect the wishes of the speaker. . . . It's a House issue.\" \n \n Allen, R-Merritt Island, was arrested July 11 outside a Titusville park public restroom after allegedly offering a male undercover officer $20 and oral sex. \n \n The lawmaker, who last year co-sponsored legislation to tighten penalties for public sex and indecent exposure, insists he is innocent, and said last month that his actions were prompted by fear because the undercover cop and passersby were all black. \n \n \"The House will continue to respect Rep. Allen's right to defend himself against the charges which arose when he was arrested,\" Rubio's office said in a statement. \n \n \"However, we must acknowledge that in addition to being a private citizen, he is a public official. As such, we are judged by a higher standard than procedural innocence. . . . It is my personal belief that because of the allegations against him, Rep. Allen can no longer effectively serve the people of his district in the Florida House.\" \n \n Allen told the Sentinel that he was \"the most misunderstood guy on Earth. \n \n \"Never was I trying to ever say Marco is the new Fidel. That's the most insulting thing you can tell anyone in Miami,\" Allen said. \"I would have used North Korea if I thought more.\" (Barbara Wilcox, The Advocate) \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/po/20070817/co_po/repboballenopensmouthinsertsfoot\n \n While I suspect his comments weren't truly racist in nature, I think his attempt to compare his plight to the problems of people under totalitarian government is ridiculously exaggerated.\n And as for trying to invoke \"American principles\", has he checked the position of his party lately? They fight AGAINST people trying to enact legislation to protect gays from being fired JUST BECAUSE they are gay.\n So why should it come as any shock to him that he broke the law and they're taking this action...",

   "North Carolina: former \"Christian\" group leader pleads guilty to solicitation\n by Pam Spaulding \u00b7 8/23/2007 03:30:00 PM ET\n Discuss this post here: Comments (58) \u00b7 digg it \u00b7 reddit \u00b7 FARK \u00b7 \u00b7 Link\n \n My, my, it is a busy week. I can hardly keep up with these guys...\n \n Former NC lawmaker, retired Baptist minister -- and now-former Christian Action League president -- Coy C. Privette pleaded guilty yesterday to six counts of aiding and abetting prostitution. He has to perform 48 hours of community service and receive counseling.\n \n In July he was busted for doing the no-tell motel dance, paying to have sex with someone other than his wife. Pious Privette receives bonus Darwin points:\n \n * he paid for the hotel rooms under his own name on six occasions;\n * the prostitute took pictures of her with the former minister using her cell phone camera.\n \n That left Privette with little other choice than to admit the hanky-panky. Outside the courtroom after the hearing, Privette passed out a statement that sounds vaguely familiar, right out of the Conservative Sexual Hypocrisy Manual.\n \n Privette said he is going to dedicate considerable time and effort to \"repair\" himself.\n \n \"I am already seeking professional attention to this end,\" he said. \"As I undergo much needed personal and spiritual reflection, I sincerely ask everyone to keep me in their thoughts and prayers on my journey to earn back the trust that I have lost.\"\n \n A sad irony of the story is that the sex worker involved was arrested for prostitution by authorites, even though she cooperated with them on the bust, which involved a forged check case investigation.\n \n According to the prosecutor the case started June 27 when a Cabarrus County bank refused to honor a check being drawn against Privette's account because it seemed high and called Kannapolis police.\n \n A police investigator interviewed Tiffany Summers who said she had received the check from Privette. She also said she had sex with Privette on a number of occasions in two hotels.\n \n For a touch of fun, take a look at the statement on morality on the Christian Action League's web site...\n \n We are in the General Assembly of North Carolina with a full-time presence promoting legislation that is consistent with a Christian worldview. We advocate for those measures that strengthen the family and oppose legislation that would erode the family structure. We are the voice of conservative evangelical Christians in the State Legislature.\n \n We discourage the promotion and use of beverage alcohol and other drugs, pornography, sexual immorality and other sinful practices that not only undermine the spiritual lives of those who participate in them, but also undermine the strength of our State and National character.",
