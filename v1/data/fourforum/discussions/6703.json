There are situations when abortion is a perfectly ethical choice and there are situations when it is not. If a family discovered that their baby had brown eyes and they wanted a baby with blue eyes and therefore decided to abort the fetus, that might be arguably unethical. If the fetus' ability to survive the trauma of birth was severely compromised and the mother was deemed not capable of surviving childbirth, and therefore it was decided to abort the fetus to save the mother, that might be arguably ethical.",

If you live in africa - of course you are not a person because you are not a citizen of the united states. if you are an astronaut you obviously leave your personhood status suspended in the atmosphere only to get it back on your way back down.
