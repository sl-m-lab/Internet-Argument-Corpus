   "Firstly, is that even how you spell concurrent?\n \n Secondly, what do the good people of the internet think about the practice of a convicted criminal serving two sentences at the same time. For example, a person is charged with stealing a car and assault at the same time, and is given a five year sentence for each, to be served concurrently. So the criminal ends up serving a total of five years.\n \n I can see where this might be useful in cases where one charge is over-turned, and the other isn't, but I don't think it is a practice that adequately serves to punish criminals, or protect other citizens.\n \n Opinions?",
