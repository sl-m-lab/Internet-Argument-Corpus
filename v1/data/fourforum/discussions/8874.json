   "3) Return of the Gollan Heights to Syria by Israel. The removal of all Israeli mines, troops and weaponary should also occur from this area. Also any Israeli settlements should be removed as well.:) :) :)\n \n This is slightly more complicated than the Chebba Farms because Israeli settlement have been built on the land, but basically it is just the same. To start with Syria should formally regonise Israels right to exist in the Middle East and stop aiding in any way Hezbolhah. Then a time table of 6 - 12 months should be set up for the full removal of settlements and residents, soldiers, mines, military equipment and weaponary. The bottom line is that it does not belong to Israel and therefore should be returned to Syria a.s.a.p. no arguments. You have to respect countries borders in the Middle East to have any chance of having peace and you can not allow the ocupation of land by a foriegn force under any circumstances. Has Syria would have formally regonised Israel and ceased from aiding Hezbolhah Israel would have no justification for ocuppying the land.emoticon_cry emoticon_cry emoticon_cry \n \n Look at another way. If I was to apply to the Syrian goverment for Syrian Citizenship and was then allowed to buy the whole of the Golan Heights from them for a \u00a31 it would then legally belong to me. I could take out a civil case against the Israeli goverment for unrightfull ocupation of my land and sue if they did leave the land. It is the same for Syria it legally belongs to them no disputes it international law, deal with it.emoticon_xgood emoticon_xgood emoticon_xgood",

Things have changed in Syria since the 60's. I do not think personally that they will arm it with weapons, etc,,, But how ever simple you think my first thread was it still should be returned to Syria. If Israel does not respect international law and return what does not belong to her then how can she expect respect in return. It is not a matter of choice for Israel but rather a matter of the law.\n \n So you are saying that if Syria gave gurantees to not use the land as a military base then Israel would imediatly remove all troops, setlements, etc from the Golan Heights and return it to Syria. You can not link it to Lebanon - only deal with the Golan Heights.",

What I was doing was sumising that the Syrian goverment would not want to build the area up militarily and that kind of assumption was wrong to do sorry. Any direct confrontation that Syria has had against Israel has always ended in failure.\n \n The whole thing of the Golan Heights is just a defensive posistion of land between Syria and Israel is true, but it has become much more than that. At present there are aprox 17,000 Jewish settlers in the Golan Heights who have built up a comunitiy. This put a whole different perpestive on the situation. Does this make it colinisation of the area by Israel? Do you think the Golan Heights will ever be returned to Syria? This is a common trend for Israel in the Middle East. Look at the West bank and Gaza Strip. The WB has jewish setlements that are ilegally built on it and the GS did have until they were recently removed by Israel. Do you know the reason why Israel has a policy of building so many settlements on land that does not legally belong to them?\n \n One other question with the 17,000 setelers living on the Golan Heights some of whom are farmers and produce crop for export and as such make a living from the land, because the land legally belongs to Syria does it mean that all or a percentage of the procedes from the crops from the land go to Syria.",

   "The Israel Arab conflict has been going on for years and needs some form of resolution. Personally I think one of the best ways to start with is to ensure that all land is controlled by the countries that are internationally recognized as owning the land. You can make comparisons to Americans returning to Europe if you want, but that is just a way of not dealing with the situation. When you look at the Golan Heights and the number of Jewish settlers there (17,000) it is a very large number to occupy Syrian land. You have to look at what is legal and what is not in the situation: without international and domestic law where would be. You can not have a country ignoring international law - it is okay for Israel to defend it self from attack, but not colonize land that legally belongs to another country.emoticon_xangel \n This goes much deeper than this with Israel. It has to stop just doing what it wants and ignoring international laws, UN resolutions and human rights and then claiming to be inocent in everything it does in the Middle East.:xbanghead",

   "Yes 17,000 is relatively a small amount of people, but legally they are still on Syrian land. I don't understand why you think it is so wrong when I say that all of the settlements and setlers on the Golan Heights should have to leave a.s.a.p. To me it just seems the most logical way of moving forward in the whole situation.\n \n I do not know the number of Israeli's who were evacuated from Gaza, but it doesn't really matter because they should not have been there in the first place anyway. Yes it is good that Israel has evacuated them from Gaza, but now they should evacuate all the other Jewish settlers in the West Bank and then move on to the Golan Heights. The thing is they are all in principle are the same situation and if Israel decides to evacuate in one then they should evacuate in all.\n \n Yes the matter with the Kurds has to be resolved, but that is another problem to deal with after this one has been sorted out.\n \n It is so important for the posibility of peace in the Middle East that Israel is made to respect international law and abide by all UN resolutions, much in the same way that it important that the Palestinian people accept the right of Israel to exist. The average Arab on the ground sees the west has being on the side of Israel allowing it to built settlements where ever it wants, to bomb indescrimitly, taking Arab prisoners when it wants in other words a law to it self. This has to change and can only occur if Israel is made more accountable for it actions. That is why I feel so strongly when I see Israel breaking internatiopnal law having settlements on land that it does not internationally own or not abiding by UN resolutions - it just makes the whole situation worse not better. I respect the Jewish people and there right to have their own homeland in the Middle East, but I want to see them being part of solution and not the problem. It may be a fear mentality of losing conrtol of the situation or the relentless attacks that they endured over the past 60 years from it's Arabic neighbours, but something has to change in Israel for the better. Look at the statistical data below:\n \n a) 1 Israeli is being held prisoner by Palestinians, while 9,599 Palestinians are currently imprisoned by Israel.\n \n b) 60+ new Jewish-only settlements have been built on confiscated Palestinian land between March 2001 and July 11, 2003. There have been 0 cases of Palestinians confiscating Israeli land and building settlements.\n \n c) 0 Israeli homes have been demolished by Palestinians and 4,170 Palestinian homes have been demolished by Israel since September 29, 2000.\n \n d) Israel has been targeted by at least 65 UN resolutions and the Palestinians have been targeted by none.\n \n e) 7,633 Israelis and 30,670 Palestinians have been injured since September 29, 2000.\n \n f) 1,084 Israelis and 4,171 Palestinians have been killed since September 29, 2000.\n \n g) 121 Israeli children have been killed by Palestinians and 779 Palestinian children have been killed by Israelis since September 29, 2000.\n \n When you read through the data and check the figures it paints a very bad picture of Israel. Take statistic c) it says that over 4170 Palestinian homes havve been demoilished since Sep 29 2000, WHY? How can a home be threat to national security so what is the reason - well to build Israeli settlements. Thats 4170 Palestinian families made homeless in aprox 5 years. Could you please justify to me what gives Israel the right to do this on land that is outside of Israel. Would they tolerate it if the Palestinians did the same to 4170 Israeli homes within Israel? In fact every single one of the above statistic paints a bad picture of Israel and that is what has to change to increase the chances of there being peace in the Middle East. I am sorry for going off at a tangent on the original thread, but I just got carried away.",
