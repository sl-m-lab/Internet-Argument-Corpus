   "I have always believed that the US is a global terrorist stated and with every new day I get more and more convinced of it. This may sound absurd but it is really salted that hundreds of various terrorist organizations in every corner of the globe were employed by the US with the only goal - to enable the US rule the world by means of provocation! You may not believe me, but it's true that terrorists helped the US to trigger off war between Israel and Lebanon. Formally, Israel had levied war upon Hezbollah after two members of Israeli services were kidnapped. In fact, these two had not been kidnapped by Hezbollah but members of Chechen terrorist organization as they'd done it on request of the US for heavy sugar. \n \n Today, America badly needs allies to start warfare against Iran as Israel is not likely to have enough means whereas the anti-Hezbollah/Lebanon operation is dragging on. That is why Americans want to make Europe rise in arms against Iran after they get attacked by \"Iranian terrorists\" who in fact have absolutely no concern with this country but carry out orders of Washington. Yet, their first try failed - Scotland Yard has foiled a horrifying plot of a group of terrorists who planned to detonate explosive devices in up to 15 planes in the air above England and the Atlantic. These people are now examined, most of them are descendants of moslem emigrants from Asia, several of them confessed to have relation to Chechen terrorists. \n \n That's it and hello doomsday! I think that people in Europe should prepare to hear about numerous terrorist acts executed by \"Iranians\" in their homelands in the short run, because Uncle Sam wants your country help him fight against Iran!",

All we've been told is that there have been 24 arrests, one being a man who converted to Islam 6 months ago, 2 are women and finance came from Pakistan. There may be 5 terrorists who escaped arrest and are at large.\n No mention of Iran or Chechnia.\n \n What on earth is Heavy Sugar?",
