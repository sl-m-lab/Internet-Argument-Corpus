So are you really positive you're not bringing god into this??? I guess it's impossible for anyone to prove that these opinions are not formed as a direct result of \"spiritual guidance\". There are plenty of differences between a foetus and a child, but that's another thread.\n \n So to avoid digressing further, I would wonder if there are any examples where there isn't this type of conflict in any type of legislation or moral judgement that is presented. You are virtually always going to be threatening the rights of an individual who doesn't agree with the views of a group that has the balance of power and is willing to use it. \n \n In terms of abortion, the reality is that there is no law forcing a religious person to have an abortion. But the churches have an intrinsic mandate to impose their views on others, regardless of the fact that abortions are simply available for the protection of women. The conflict is unavoidable!",

   "Well, not real sure why I'm pro-gun matters either, but anyway\n\n \n Because I have a point with asking. Do you have a point?\n \n \n \n \n\n And I'm sure you value YOUR life than mine\n\n \n I assume you mean that I value MY life more than YOURS, and you are correct. If I had to choose, you would die before me. The value of life varies person to person.\n \n \n\n Obviously I have a very real and rational expectation that if they would break into my home to take something, they could be there to harm me as well. If I pull a gun on a cop, he's not gonna take the time to determine if I have bulletts....\n\n \n They could. There is no guarantee, and that is your point, isn't it? There has to be a guarantee? Pulling a gun on a cop? When did cops enter into this?\n \n \n\n I'd love to respond, but I wasn't sure where one thing ended, so could you clarify?\n\n \n Ah, a blind spot where your hypocrisy is concerned, eh? When you are critical of people who are pro-choice, saying that we don't value human life you are being hypocritical. The value of human life varies to you, just as you accuse of pro-choice people.\n \n \n\n AH, my way would be REAL cheap and very much a deterrent :-D\n\n \n Bypassing due process of law isn't allowed ;) Innocent until proven guilty and all that, and that's what is so expensive. Trials to prove guilt.\n \n \n\n You assume much LOL Honestly, I haven't given much thought to it. My first reaction is if the person if of sound mind then yes, it's okay. I will qualify that, by again stating that I haven't really weighed everything, so don't go trying to use that against me :-P\n\n \n Truly told, I could care less about it. If people want to kill themselves in this way why not.\n \n \n\n No, true, but there IS a reasonable expectation that they will...see the cop analogy above\n\n \n And there is a reasonable expectation that a pregnancy will be hard on a woman's body. There is a reasonable expectation that a woman will not be as healthy during the pregnancy. There is reasonable expectation that being pregnant is harmful to her health. There is reasonable expectation that it will harm her physically, emotionally, mentally or financially depending on the situation. Making broad comments and, more importantly, arbitrary laws that don't take into account specific situations is very irresponsible.\n \n \n\n My wife and I have \"selfishly\" had three and she seems pretty darn healthy to me :-D\n\n \n Congratulations! Was she as healthy during the pregnancy as before and after? Was she able to do everything that she was able to do during as before and after? Pregnancy has effects on health, sometimes serious effects. If her health deteriorated, would you really support legislation that forced her to continue the pregnancy that was seriously and adversly affecting her health? If, heaven forbid, she was debilitated after the first pregnancy, recovered and accidently got pregnant again and told you she did not think she can face the health effects a second or third time, could you really support legislation that forced her to continue the pregnancy?\n \n \n\n Would you want me up on murder charges if I killed someone who I just ASSUMED would kill me (NOT the intruder scenario please, talking about someone just walking down the street). There HAS to be a guarantee or a reasonable expectation to justifiable kill someone\n\n \n \"someone walking down the street\" is not comparable to a fetus that is inside a woman, sharing her bodily resources and drawing nutrients out of her against her will and without her consent. It is much much more comparable to an intruder inside your home. It isn't ASSUMED that a fetus is sharing a woman's bodily resources and drawing nutrients out of her body, it's a fact. A fetus puts stress on a woman's body, sometimes a lot, sometimes enough to kill her, sometimes not so much. Every woman should have the right to not risk her health against her will.\n \n \n\n From this statement, it sounds like there should not be consequences to ANY actions then. When a life is involved, there is no FORCING involved, that's just a copout so a woman can behave like a man without any consequences. I'm sure you'd agree then that we should do away with deadbeat dad laws? I mean, he shouldn't have to face any consequences for his actions, right?\n\n \n I personally believe that a man should be able to \"abort\" his rights and responsibilites when a woman is pregnant, but we aren't talking about anyone elses rights or responsibilites. We are talking about abortion.\n \n \n\n Yep, guilty as charged, but there ARE those \"femi-nazi's\" out there who DO think that\n\n \n And in some cases, it is true. A fetus can indeed be a life-risk for a woman. A health risk is more frequent.\n \n \n\n Who said anything about it being a punishment? what a sad way of looking at motherhood. Sex is not a crime, I'm all for it actually :-D, but murder IS, and murder should NOT be made less of a crime just out of convenience to the woman\n\n \n I agree. Good thing abortion is not murder. \n \n You treat sex as a crime when you legislate consequences to it. Whatever \"natural\" consequences come from it come from it. Legal consequences are a different matter, and when you legislate motherhood as a consequence for sex you treat motherhood as a punishment.\n \n \n\n AAAAAHHHHHHH a perfect world WOULD be nice, wouldn't it? LOL \n\n \n Then you won't mind me working toward that, eh?\n \n \n\n LOL, why does MY attitude need serious adjusting? I'm defending an INNOCENT life here, and THAT'S a BAD thing? Man, we are living in Bizarro world now, scary\n\n \n And I'm defending women so that they aren't required to be pregnant for your morals! Your attitude that ignores women's needs and desires needs adjusting.\n \n \n\n No, it is simply putting innocent life above petty, selfish \"rights\"\n\n \n Putting an \"innocent life\" that has not been born over the life of women who have to bear that burden against their will. It's really disgusting.",

   "Because I have a point with asking. Do you have a point?\n\n \n C'mon, don't try to defend your assumption and then put others down for making their own! You EASILY could have made your point about killing an intruder whether or not I was \"pro-gun\", so don't get righteous with me\n \n \n \nI assume you mean that I value MY life more than YOURS, and you are correct. If I had to choose, you would die before me. The value of life varies person to person.\n\n \n Well IF you mean civilized people compared to the animals in the Middle East, then I would agree, but without an absolute in society it begins to decay. When we can all go around with our own set of rules, how can a society survive? Now, if you are juvenile and still have a problem with authority, then I guess you wouldn't agree with that statement. Anyway, I said this originally because I took your comment to mean that I was somehow a terrible person for valuing my life and the lives of my family more than that of someone breaking into my home\n \n \nThey could. There is no guarantee, and that is your point, isn't it? There has to be a guarantee? Pulling a gun on a cop? When did cops enter into this?\n\n \n I know I said a guarantee, but I also believe I had said if there is a reasonable expectation as well, so please don't take my words out of context in order to try to prove me wrong. It is REASONABLE to expect that someone committing such an act as breaking into my home, that they are there for a bad reason. I therefore, should not have to sit back and ask what his intentions are, I have the right to ASSUME he is there to do me harm. \n \n If you are saying that you are surprised that a cop would have the right to shoot you if you pull a gun on him, then you are more naive than I could have dreamed. Are you really telling me, that if you were a cop, you would wait for someone with a gun to raise it, point it at you and fire, before deciding that they are going to do you harm? \n \n \n \nAh, a blind spot where your hypocrisy is concerned, eh? When you are critical of people who are pro-choice, saying that we don't value human life you are being hypocritical.

I didn't want to come right out and criticize the run on sentence, so I just asked you to clarify. IF you are referring to my celebrating over the death of someone who entered my home without permission, how do you come to the conclusion that I'm being hypocritical. Not everyone's life has the same value. People that commit illegal or evil acts against others have forfeited their \"right\" to be treated equally and to me the value of their life is greatly diminished. An innocent life, one that has done NOTHING evil or illegal, has the MOST value as far as I'm concerned, so yes, those innocent lives should be spared. I fail to see the hypocrisy (unless I was desperate to make a point of course, then it becomes obvious LOL)\n \n \n \nAnd there is a reasonable expectation that a pregnancy will be hard on a woman's body. There is a reasonable expectation that a woman will not be as healthy during the pregnancy. There is reasonable expectation that being pregnant is harmful to her health. There is reasonable expectation that it will harm her physically, emotionally, mentally or financially depending on the situation. Making broad comments and, more importantly, arbitrary laws that don't take into account specific situations is very irresponsible.\n\n \n Who is claiming that pregnancy is easy? Have I ever said that? All I have said is that it is a normal biological process for which a woman's body is equipped to handle...if she couldn't, the human race would disappear. Does that mean that some women are unable to have a child safely? Of course not, I never said that EVERY woman on the planet has to lay on her back and spit one kid after another out of her. It is absolutley ridiculous to use this juvenile argument that because a baby obtains nutrients from the mother, and because this affects her health, FOR THE MOST PART DURING (SOME women might be affected afterward) her pregnancy, that somehow taking that innocent life is then justified is...just juvenile, not other polite way to put it.\n \n \nCongratulations! Was she as healthy during the pregnancy as before and after? Was she able to do everything that she was able to do during as before and after? Pregnancy has effects on health, sometimes serious effects. \n\n \n ROTFLAMO!!! Ya know what, when I have the flu, I can't do the things I could BEFORE I had the flu, SOMETIMES the flu kills people. Whya hasn't Congress looked into a law against the FLU? Don't they care about us, those bastards?\n \n \nIf her health deteriorated, would you really support legislation that forced her to continue the pregnancy that was seriously and adversly affecting her health? If, heaven forbid, she was debilitated after the first pregnancy, recovered and accidently got pregnant again and told you she did not think she can face the health effects a second or third time, could you really support legislation that forced her to continue the pregnancy?\n\n \n Why do those of you who believe in killing innocent babies like to throw this in to the debate? It has been acknowledged by MOST people who are \"pro-life\" that if the mother's LIFE is in danger, then an abortion can be justified. You're going to throw it some few instances (like the whacked out chick in Texas who drowned her five kids) that the EVIL man just wanted to use her to spit out as many kids as possible with complete disregard for his wife's health..again, another desperate attempt to make a point\n \n \n \n\"someone walking down the street\" is not comparable to a fetus that is inside a woman, sharing her bodily resources and drawing nutrients out of her against her will and without her consent. \n \n \n Have you ever REALLY stopped to read and think about that statement? LMAO it really IS, without a doubt, THE silliest thing I've ever heard. The death of this country is putting EVERYTHING in legal terms. Then let me ask you, does the fetus CHOOSE to selfishly rob the mother of these nutrients? Oh wait, ignorance of the law is no defense, right? The fetus SHOULD know that it's actions are against the law, right? ROTFLMAO Man, you people think you have a winner of a point, and all I see are people with big clown shoes and orange hair trying to make it. You really don't know how silly you look hiding behind this \"argument\"\n \n \nA fetus puts stress on a woman's body, sometimes a lot, sometimes enough to kill her, sometimes not so much. Every woman should have the right to not risk her health against her will.\n\n \n My job puts stress on MY body, sometimes a lot, sometimes enough to kill people, sometimies not so much LOL I wish, JUST FOR ONCE, you people would just have the courage, without hiding behind silly arguments, to admit that all abortion is is a selfish act so that a woman does not have to be responsible for her actions (i.e., laying on her back with whoever she damn well pleases, afterall, a MAN can do it, so why can't WE, right?).\n \n \n \nI personally believe that a man should be able to \"abort\" his rights and responsibilites when a woman is pregnant, but we aren't talking about anyone elses rights or responsibilites. We are talking about abortion.\n\n \n Okay, now don't be disingenuous, you know as well as I do that that \"pig\" of a man that would leave a woman to face ALL the responsibilities by herself should be made to pay dearly. And for your information, the act of having an abortion when it is NOT medically necessary, is the act of someone running away from their responsibilities. IF in fact you really believe a man shouldn't be held responsible I guess I can at least say that you are consistent...and in Bizarro world yours would be a good thing. See, I believe a man SHOULD be responsible, and not ONLY financially...I also think the WOMAN should be responsible and have the child.. I TOO am consistent and I happen to live a place called REALITY\n \n \nAnd in some cases, it is true. A fetus can indeed be a life-risk for a woman. A health risk is more frequent.\n\n \n Your credibility is GREATLY diminished when you make this statement, even if you only PARTIALLY agree with it. It ALMOST is as silly as the \"robbing nutrients\"...maybe not LOL IN order for you to take actions that involve self defense, wouldn't you have to be taking actions against someon who is INTENTIONALLY trying to harm you?\n \n \n \nI agree. Good thing abortion is not murder. \n\n \n You are lying to yourself, it IS out of convenience and YOU know it deep down, but you know if you DO admit it then you have no other leg to stand on. GEEEEEZ, for so long the argument your side had was that the fetus WASN'T life, and since that has been totally blown out of the water you people have had to go to plan B, and you rely on the argument developed by some geeky little attorney or some femi-nazi who hates men. When I was growing up, when your story kept changing, it meant that you were lying...seems now in Bizarro world, it's okay to keep changing your story, if they don't buy this one, we'll keep trying another until they do. I believe the \"pro-life\" argument has remained pretty much the same over the years\n \n \nYou treat sex as a crime when you legislate consequences to it. Whatever \"natural\" consequences come from it come from it. Legal consequences are a different matter, and when you legislate motherhood as a consequence for sex you treat motherhood as a punishment.\n\n \n HUH? Pregnancy IS a natural consequence, isn't it? There is no LEGAL consequence to that. I get the feeling that you are very young, and I can accept blame on behalf of my generation for the way you think. When I was a kid and you did ANYTHING, you accepted the consequences that followed..you learned that there were other things that could happen as a result of my actions. My generation has screwed your mind up, making you believe that there is ALWAYS a way out, no matter what you've done. If you committed a crime, even a minor one, mommy and daddy spent big bucks on a lawyer so your \"good name\" would stay in tact. Now, if you want to interpret a woman not being allowed to commit murder out of convenience as something being a consequence that is legislated, then so be it. All it REALLY boils down to is if you are old enough to lay on your back and you know that pregnancy is a \"natural consequence\" then you have to take responsibility FOR your actions. I know that's not a concept that is recognized in Bizarro world...:-D\n \n May I ask you, if I have AIDS and spread the virus to other women, should there be legal consequences to my actions? I mean really, if so, you would be placing \"legal consequences\" on sex, wouldn't you?\n \n \nThen you won't mind me working toward that, eh?\n\n \n As long as it's not at the expense of innocent life, I could care less if you want to waste your time on a fruitless search\n \n \nAnd I'm defending women so that they aren't required to be pregnant for your morals! Your attitude that ignores women's needs and desires needs adjusting.\n\n \n No, you are fighting to allow women to do what they want with total disregard for anybody else\n \n \nPutting an \"innocent life\" that has not been born over the life of women who have to bear that burden against their will. It's really disgusting.\n\n \n It really is very simple, then don't lay on your back and put yourself in the position of getting pregnant! Despite what you think, I'm not some old fuddy duddy LOL There ARE other ways of enjoying sex, are there not? If you aren't aware of them, you might want to ask around LOL",

An STD is a normal biological process for a virus. Your body becomes infected in a \"natural way\". You are allowed to stop it despite it being \"natural\".\n \n Not every woman is able to \"handle a pregnancy\" as easily as others. It is not up to you to decide if she still has to. It is up to the woman, and rightly so. It is justified because the fetus does not have the right to take nutrients against the mother's will and without her consent.

This is more comparable to an intruder in your home than a random person on the street.\n \n eta, The fetus cannot choose anything, it has no concept of choice. Any and all choices for the fetus are done by the mother.

You can quit. You do not want to allow a woman to \"quit\" the pregnancy, despite any harm that comes to her short of killing her.\n \n I am not denying that an abortion is usually a selfish act. So is you killing an intruder. She values her life and her goals in life more than she values the fetus. She values her physical well-being, her emotional well-being, her mental well-being and her financial well-being more than she values the fetus inside of her. Is it wrong? Depends on who you ask. Should selfishness be illegal? You better lock up every single person ever born.

It is sometimes easier to face than pregnancy and motherhood which is why it happens. I can understand, since pregnancy and motherhood are life-changing events that should not happen because a woman has no other choice.\n \n I agree that men should be responsible, and so should women. However, I also believe that no-one should be a parent because they have no other choice. I strongly believe that every pregnancy and child should be wanted. Your way of forcing motherhood on unwilling people is not the way to do it, imo.\n \n Abortion is the responsible choice in some circumstances. Sometimes having a child is not a responsible thing to do.\n \n \n\n Your credibility is GREATLY diminished when you make this statement, even if you only PARTIALLY agree with it. It ALMOST is as silly as the \"robbing nutrients\"...maybe not LOL IN order for you to take actions that involve self defense, wouldn't you have to be taking actions against someon who is INTENTIONALLY trying to harm you?\n\n \n Then you deny that a pregnancy can sometimes kill a woman? It does not have to be intentional. If I am swinging a bat and unintentionally swing it toward you and you knock it out of my hand, are you acting in self-defense? Self-defense is just that, defending yourself from harm, intentional or otherwise.\n \n \n\n You are lying to yourself, it IS out of convenience and YOU know it deep down, but you know if you DO admit it then you have no other leg to stand on.

I believe the \"pro-life\" argument has remained pretty much the same over the years\n\n \n I don't lie, least of all to myself. At least, not intentionally ;) Must have been a result of bad intel.\n \n eta, The story does not keep changing. There are just so many compelling reasons to keep abortion legal. Moral grounds, legal grounds, biologic grounds, medical grounds, in nearly every way you can think of there are compelling reasons to keep abortion legal or to allow abortions.\n \n \n\n HUH? Pregnancy IS a natural consequence, isn't it? There is no LEGAL consequence to that. I get the feeling that you are very young, and I can accept blame on behalf of my generation for the way you think. When I was a kid and you did ANYTHING, you accepted the consequences that followed..you learned that there were other things that could happen as a result of my actions. My generation has screwed your mind up, making you believe that there is ALWAYS a way out, no matter what you've done. If you committed a crime, even a minor one, mommy and daddy spent big bucks on a lawyer so your \"good name\" would stay in tact. Now, if you want to interpret a woman not being allowed to commit murder out of convenience as something being a consequence that is legislated, then so be it. All it REALLY boils down to is if you are old enough to lay on your back and you know that pregnancy is a \"natural consequence\" then you have to take responsibility FOR your actions. I know that's not a concept that is recognized in Bizarro world...:-D\n\n \n Quite a rant. Getting older are we?\n \n Abortion is taking responsibility FOR your actions. It is a consequence. You don't like this particular choice, but you cannot deny that it is a possible consequence. Not taking responsibility is not thinking about the future, not thinking about how the pregnancy and childbirth will affect you and your future. In some cases, abortion is the responsible choice.\n \n You wish to make motherhood a legal consequence. Pregnancy is a possible consequence to sex, as you say a \"natural\" consequence. Abortion can be a consequence as well, depending on the woman involved and what decision she makes. You wish to make a legal consequence for becoming pregnant which is mandating motherhood.\n \n \n\n May I ask you, if I have AIDS and spread the virus to other women, should there be legal consequences to my actions? I mean really, if so, you would be placing \"legal consequences\" on sex, wouldn't you?\n\n \n And you would be in favor of telling women to \"deal with it\" since she should have been more careful and really she consented when she had sex didn't she? STDs are a possible consequence for \"laying on her back\".\n \n \n \n\n As long as it's not at the expense of innocent life, I could care less if you want to waste your time on a fruitless search\n\n \n Ah, such a pessimist.\n \n \n \n\n No, you are fighting to allow women to do what they want with total disregard for anybody else\n\n \n Negative, I wish to see that their rights aren't reduced in favor of what is growing inside them.\n \n \n \n(\n It really is very simple, then don't lay on your back and put yourself in the position of getting pregnant! Despite what you think, I'm not some old fuddy duddy LOL There ARE other ways of enjoying sex, are there not? If you aren't aware of them, you might want to ask around LOL\n\n \n Thank you, I know a bit about sex already ;) \n \n I agree that people shouldn't put themselves into positions without thinking about what can happen. Unfortunately, they do. I still do not believe women should be punished for irresponsible behavior by being forced to gestate and give birth.",

Using the word \"person\" is pretty universal as well instead of \"human\" because then you get into sticky \"what exactly makes a human human\" type of debate. \"Person\" is able to be defined without getting into that type of debate.\n \n I really think the language is used as it's used because it works without a lot of qualifiers and such.",

   "I tied it in to being \"pro-gun\" because it shows you, in a way you can understand, that the value of human life is subjective depending on the circumstances you are in. Hopefully, it will put a stop to you crowing about how people who are pro-choice do not value human life.\n\n \n You continually and conveniently leave out the part of INNOCENT life, and that of course is what I'M referring to. The guy breaking into my home is not innocent, so therefore his worth is diminished. STOP...THINK LOL\n \n \nNo clue why you brought up the Middle East.\n\n \n I only mentioned this because in post #31 you had said how the value of life varies from person to person, and I was throwing in an example of people from the UNcivilized world who don't value life on ANY level.\n \n \nI'm not sure what your analogy is with the cop, or what your point is.\n\n \n Are you just ACTING stupid or.... LOL I was making an obvious analogy that killing in self defense is justified as long as there is a REASONABLE expectation that you will be harmed. It's unfortunate that I have to try to simplify things so it's easier for you to understand, and then it becomes too much for you to handle all at once\n \n \nIt was not a run-on sentence. I over-use commas sometimes, but the sentence makes perfect sense if you say it right. \n\n \n Well, back in my day we knew how to write and had some knowledge of punctuation, sorry I wasn't raised with the lower standards of your generation \n \n \nYou are being hypocritical when you blast pro-choice people, saying that we do not value human life when you yourself do not value the life of an intruder in your home and would in fact celebrate at his death. And this is just assuming he will do you harm.\n\n \n Honey, I'd swim in his blood with orgasmic glee!!!! You must not be a parent, because you have no idea what a human being is capable of when your family is in danger. Ever see Patriot? The scene when Gibson mutilates the guy? You've got to tie me in my seat during that scene ;-) OH, but wait, you may never know about this because you are so UNselfish as to not have a child...LOL\n \n \nA fetus' rights to live (which it does not have, btw) does not supercede a woman's right to her own body. A fetus lives at the sufferance of the body it occupies.\n\n \n You guys have better brainwashing techniques than the Moonies!!! LOL\n \n \n \nThen you are ignoring the hardships it puts on a woman's body? \n \n \n NOPE, I thought it was clear that I acknowledged the hardships...I'm not really sure I could've put it any more simple than I did\n \n \nWhy are you able to say to a woman I know its hard but you have to tough it out because I say so. \n\n \n All I'm saying is don't get pregnant because I said so :-P\n \n \nIt is a normal biological process that a woman may not want and is able to stop.\n \n \n Just because one can stop it doesn't mean one should. I will repeat, if you don't want it, don't get pregnant in the first place..is that ALSO too hard to understand for you?\n \n \nIt is justified because the fetus does not have the right to take nutrients against the mother's will and without her consent. Why is that hard to understand?\n\n \n Well, it's just silly and juvenile, so in THAT way it's hard to understand\n \n \nAnd what do you do when you have the flu? Try to get rid of the damn thing don't ya?!\n\n \n Well, TECHNICALLY speaking, you can't get rid of the flu, you can only try to prevent it, and IF you get it you have to endure it\n \n \n \nHow stupid is your comparing killing a random person on the street with the intensly personal and integrated nature of pregnancy? The fetus is not a stranger; it is a creature that is attached, drawing energy from the mother and dumping wastes into her system. It is literally living off of her body. This is more comparable to an intruder in your home than a random person on the street.\n\n \n God help us...proof of the failure of the public school system. An obvious simple analogy to try to make it easy for you, I wasn't making a real comparison\n \n \neta, The fetus cannot choose anything, it has no concept of choice. Any and all choices for the fetus are done by the mother. Just because the fetus isn't intentionally harming its mother does not mean it is not harming its mother.\n\n \n Okay, her's another SIMPLE analogy, okay? If I kill someone while drunk driving, I don't get the death penalty because it wasn't \"intentional\". So, why does the fetus, which you have acknowledged as being a life, have to have it's life ended, because it selfishly and unintentionally robs the mother of nutrients. \n \n \nThen quit. You can quit. You do not want to allow a woman to \"quit\" the pregnancy, despite any harm that comes to her short of killing her.\n\n \n Being a good Liberal, I'm sure to you that is an easy thing to do, but for those of us that understand responsibility, it's not that easy. And women that understand the concepts of sacrifice and responsibility willingly endure the hardships for the rewards that follow...but these are things you just can't grasp\n \n \n \nI am not denying that an abortion is usually a selfish act. So is you killing an intruder. She values her life and her goals in life more than she values the fetus. She values her physical well-being, her emotional well-being, her mental well-being and her financial well-being more than she values the fetus inside of her. Is it wrong? Depends on who you ask. Should selfishness be illegal? You better lock up every single person ever born. I for one can not blame her for looking after herself first, and you are hypocritical when you do blame her for valuing herself more than another.\n\n \n I will say unequivocally that it is DEAD wrong. I WILL judge you and everyone around me. It's not my job to judge your soul (or lack thereof LOL), but I can sure judge your behavior. There's no law against selfishness but maybe there should be,,,afterall, there IS a law against hate, right? And by the way, it most likely escaped you, but I'm joking (about the law for selfishness anyway, unfortunately you Libs have gotten your law against hate)\n \n \n \nwtf are you going on about? You have some real woman-issues you need to work out when you spout this drivel with no promptings.\n\n \n Why do you immediately assume I have issues with women? Pretty sad tactic. Remember that simple rule..STOP...THINK? It's pretty obvious that I was spelling out what motivates people like you to so rabidly defend the taking of a life. The women's rights movement has brainwashed women into believing they can do everything a man can, and it doesn't stop with the professional world either. They want it with regard to sexual activity. Those dar babies get in the way of their sexual freedom, and THAT'S at least one of the reasons you fight to take an innocent life\n \n Anyway, too tired and bored to deal with the rest of this...maybe tomorrow :-D",

And you are qualified to decide what those hardships justify why?\n \n \n\n All I'm saying is don't get pregnant because I said so :-P\n\n \n This is a ridiculous pro-life argument. When we are talking about abortion, the woman is already pregnant. What are you are doing is saying that we should have closed the door after the man has escaped. Ok, yeah, we should have closed the door but what do we do now that he has escaped?! \n \n Your comment ignores the extremely varied circumstances that women find themselves in. However, whatever the circumstances of her getting pregnant whether it be getting drunk, smoking weed, getting raped, wanting a pregnancy then finding the situation is untenable, wanting a pregnancy and then losing a job, being physically threatened, emotionally abused, any number or any combination of these and other innumerable things, in the end she is still pregnant and we are arguing whether she should be allowed to have an abortion.\n \n \n\n Just because one can stop it doesn't mean one should. I will repeat, if you don't want it, don't get pregnant in the first place..is that ALSO too hard to understand for you?\n\n \n Of course it doesn't mean one should. However, you cannot argue that it cannot be allowed because it's a \"natural biological process\". That is a really stupid argument. \n \n I agree that if you don't want it you shouldn't get pregnant. However, women still get pregnant and then don't want the pregnancy. Sometimes they get pregnant unintentionally, sometimes it is after they are pregnant that they discover that the situation is untenable. Whatever the reason, they are pregnant. Saying well they shouldn't have gotten pregnant ignores the problem.\n \n \n\n Well, it's just silly and juvenile, so in THAT way it's hard to understand\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n\n Well, TECHNICALLY speaking, you can't get rid of the flu, you can only try to prevent it, and IF you get it you have to endure it\n\n \n While with pregnancy you can get rid of it :) Good thing too, sometimes it isn't something a woman wants to endure.\n \n \n\n God help us...proof of the failure of the public school system. An obvious simple analogy to try to make it easy for you, I wasn't making a real comparison\n\n \n ... \n I said:\n \nThat you would not allow abortion unless a death is guaranteed is sickening and careless of health hazards to women from pregnancy.\n\n \n Then you said:\n \n\n Would you want me up on murder charges if I killed someone who I just ASSUMED would kill me (NOT the intruder scenario please, talking about someone just walking down the street). There HAS to be a guarantee or a reasonable expectation to justifiable kill someone \n\n \n Obviously trying to compare killing someone just walking down the street to abortion. Do you practise being obtuse?\n \n \n\n Okay, her's another SIMPLE analogy, okay? If I kill someone while drunk driving, I don't get the death penalty because it wasn't \"intentional\". So, why does the fetus, which you have acknowledged as being a life, have to have it's life ended, because it selfishly and unintentionally robs the mother of nutrients. \n\n \n Not because it \"selfishly and unintentionally robs the mother of nutrients\" but because the mother is not required to allow it to do that if she does not wish to share her body's resources.\n \n The drunk driver is not required to donate his or her kidney if the person they hit needs a kidney, even if he or she caused the accident intentionally or otherwise.\n \n \n\n Being a good Liberal, I'm sure to you that is an easy thing to do, but for those of us that understand responsibility, it's not that easy. And women that understand the concepts of sacrifice and responsibility willingly endure the hardships for the rewards that follow...but these are things you just can't grasp\n\n \n (emphasis mine)\n \n And unwillingly? If the rewards that follow are not worth the pain now?\n \n Oh, I grasp them perfectly, but you undermine your own argument saying what you do. I have no problem with what you say here, I even agree with you to a certain extent. With many women, the pain and sacrifice they go through with pregnancy is rewarded with a child that they did all of this for. However, if the pregnancy is unwanted then the child that they will be presented with at the end is not worth the pain and sacrifice they are going through now. I don't believe in forcing them through that pain and sacrifice unwillingly.\n \n \n\n I will say unequivocally that it is DEAD wrong. I WILL judge you and everyone around me. It's not my job to judge your soul (or lack thereof LOL), but I can sure judge your behavior. There's no law against selfishness but maybe there should be,,,afterall, there IS a law against hate, right? And by the way, it most likely escaped you, but I'm joking (about the law for selfishness anyway, unfortunately you Libs have gotten your law against hate)\n\n \n Agreed, it's hard to keep from judging people. I know that I can't help but judge you ;)\n \n Yeah, hate crime laws are really ridiculous. Virtually all crimes against individuals are motivated at some levels by hate. Having a law against selfishness is the stupidest thing I've ever heard however. Thank goodness you're joking.\n \n \n\n Why do you immediately assume I have issues with women? Pretty sad tactic.\n\n \n When you're pulling **** like \"these women just want to act like men\" it makes me think you have some deep-seated issues with women who aren't demure and passive.\n \n \n\n Remember that simple rule..STOP...THINK? It's pretty obvious that I was spelling out what motivates people like you to so rabidly defend the taking of a life.\n\n \n I believe I told you exactly what is motivating me... and it has nothing to do with women's sexual desires. If you want to debate that, we'd have to start a new thread, but somehow I don't believe you will. Probably reveal too many skeletons in your closet :P \n \n \n\n The women's rights movement has brainwashed women into believing they can do everything a man can, and it doesn't stop with the professional world either. They want it with regard to sexual activity. Those dar babies get in the way of their sexual freedom, and THAT'S at least one of the reasons you fight to take an innocent life\n\n \n Blah blah blah. Whether or not a woman wants to have a lot of sex outside of marriage or wants to have sex only with her husband has no bearing on my argument. Unplanned or unwanted pregnancies happen with any kind of couple or single parent.\n \n That you bring this up makes me think that you have some inner issue with women who want to have lots of sex. I certainly said nothing about it and it hasn't been part of any of my argument with you.\n \n \n\n Anyway, too tired and bored to deal with the rest of this...maybe tomorrow :-D\n\n \n Always good for a laugh :)",

I can tell you that there are success stories when it comes to rags to riches (my dad is one of them), however    he grew up in a stable two parent home and was well educated (thanks in part to our awesome public education but thats another story). I see that a lot of times my students come from very unstable homes (drugs, rapes, young siblings murdered in the street, foster homes, youname it and they've seen it). Its difficult to have these students focus on learning that the tectonic plates of the earth are shifting because of the convection currents in the lithosphere (6th grade Earth Science) when they are worried about dad beating up mom...or mom's going to jail for cutting the neighbor, etc. It becomes a vicious cycle that very few can break out of because this type of lifestyle does affect you psychologically. They are poor, not because they want to be poor. Sometimes they just don't know how to get out of the poverty. Its all they know! \n \n Last year I took my students on a field trip to the beach. I work in Los Angeles County about 30 minutes driving distance from the beach. You should have heard the stunning silence that came accross the school bus when they saw the beach and then the loud \"WOW!\" 10 of my students (35 total) had never seen the beach in real life until that moment. Field trips are hard to come by these days (They don't make it easy for teachers to take kids on field trips either)...\n \n Anyway, my point was poverty can sometimes be a cycle. If its all you've known you are more likely to fall into it because you have not been exposed to anything else.\n \n As for the picking yourself up by the straps of your own boots...Its a cute idea but when you don't have any straps on your boots, no food, or safe shelter then Maslow's hierarchy of needs comes into play...",

But, I leave room for those who simply aren't excited. And I leave room for those who simply say no. I don't want a baby.

Some don't believe. Period. I have enough religion to say that God will decide right-wrong, good-bad, innocence-guilt. He doesn't need my help. I have faith in His ability to handle it. I also have enough religion to say that IF that was a life (I'm not so sure), and IF it has a soul, and IF it has not yet taken on original sin, the baby's well being isn't in jeopardy.

   "\n Keep it straight now..I didn't say YOU misspoke, you were getting on ME about the grossly negligent use of argument instead of belief LOL I'm mocking you and others like you that have to jump down people's throats for one little misspeak or not quite using the Webster approved use of the word\n\n \n I was hardly jumping down your throat, I was clarifying what I believe. I need Webster approved words to know what the heck you are saying ;)\n \n \n\n Good Lord, here we go again..probable/possible..I'm not gonna go out and get some stinking MIT math geek to give me the possibilities and probabilities, so give me a freaking break. The simple, common sense point is that at any given time (you should know this, being a good Liberal and all, what with the TERRIBLE economy) a person can lose their job, savings or not, there is no way of knowing when you'll find another. Therefore your financial situation would not be classified as being secure (unless you have millions saved) There is a decent and reasonable chance (is that good enough or are you gonna pull out the dictionary and razor blade again) one's finances will get better as well\n\n \n Yes, you could at any point lose your job, no matter what your job is. You could lose your job at any point. Does that stop you from being confident that you aren't going to lose your job if your job is going well and there is no reason to believe you will lose it? I have just gotten a new job and I have little fear I will suddenly lose it (though it is indeed possible). There is no reasonable fear of losing my job.\n \n I would call my financial situation secure if I have no reasonable fear of losing my job and I have savings built up and I was putting money away every paycheck. At that point I would feel confident I could support a child with my SO.\n \n I still don't know what you are talking about saying that there is a \"reasonable chance one's finances will get better as well\". Over what time frame are you talking about? It probably won't suddenly get better over a pregnancy, and if one cannot support a pregnancy or child at the start, there is no reasonable belief that one can at the end. If you mean that over years one's income generally goes up then I would generally agree with you. However, that does not help a woman who is pregnant NOW and cannot afford it.\n \n \n\n and TOMORROW things could turn around. Over the course of a pregnancy your finances can indeed get better so yes it DOES mean something\n\n \n Only if you get a significant raise or quit your job and start somewhere else that pays better. There is no guarantee of either, and betting my future on the hope that I can have either is not something I would do (unless I had a very good idea that I would be hired at the new place).\n \n Yes, tomorrow things could turn around. But I'm putting my faith on the trend of things, not sudden spikes and drops. Certainly I will try and prepare for them, but I am not basing my decisions completely on what ifs.\n \n \n\n I think it's obvious, without me pulling out the dictionary, what you meant/inferred/implied (or any other synonym that will pass your legalese test). None of us know what our financial future holds for us\n\n \n No, but you can reasonably predict what things will do. If there are warning signs that you may lose your job then you make decisions based on that. If there are no warning signs that you will lose your job then you make decisions based on that. Of course you can lose your job without warning signs, but you cannot base every decision on the assumption that you will lose your job without warning. No one is psychic (at least I'm not), so all you can do is base decisions on what you know and what is reasonable to predict.\n \n \n\n you must be a generation Xer...looking out for numero uno, huh? Funny, that's what us Conservatives are falsely ACCUSED of and you are actually living it. Liberals have no problem telling OTHERS to sacrifice for others, yet can't do it themselves\n\n \n Wait, earlier in the debates you thought I was really young... gen Xers aren't terribly young. \n \n Who says I'm liberal? I'm really not terribly liberal except on the abortion issue. Even here I believe in personal decisions and removing the interference of the gov't, which are \"conservative\" ideals I think. I have not asked others to sacrifice anything. Yet you are telling others that they must sacrifice their bodies and lives for others, and in fact you said:\n \n \nGod forbid you would have to sacrifice YOUR comfort for anything or anyONE else\n\n \n So which is it. Are you telling me I must sacrifice for another, or do you believe that I should decide for myself whether or not to sacrifice? Or are you Liberal for telling others to sacrifice? I really don't believe I have the right to tell others what they must sacrifice. I don't believe you have that right either.\n \n \n\n Then go on your knees but don't lay on your back...simple\n\n \n On my knees? Am I supposed to give my boss head? That's your solution to getting ahead in life?\n \n \n\n Such a good little Liberal..the world is a big bad scary place, isn't it? That's why y'all want the government to watch over you like mommy and daddy, gotta have that safety net in everything you do\n\n \n If it makes you feel better believing that, go ahead. I have in fact said that I don't think the gov't should be involved in abortion at all. If I was what you are suggesting I am then wouldn't I say \"go ahead and get pregnant because the gov't will take care of you anyway\". Wouldn't I think that we should create more gov't programs to support pregnant women instead of believing women shouldn't have children if they are not financially secure enough to support them?

You can't have it both ways. I realize there are degrees of anguish, but you have claimed/inferred/implied that this is a makor decision that can have longlasting effects on a woman's life.\n\n \n Agreed, no one can have things both ways (generally speaking). Abortion is a major decision, and the decision to have a child is also a major decision. Trying to judge which makes more of an impact on a woman's life has way too many variables to judge objectively. My own opinion is that having a child has more of an impact on a woman's life.\n \n \n\n I would suggest that IF you use this, you need to also add that for MOST women the decision for an abortion is made as easily as what to fix for dinner\n\n \n No, I don't agree with this.

THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH JUDGING PEOPLE!!!! GOOD LORD! WE AREN'T CONDEMNING SOULS. JUDGE ME PLEASE!!!!\n\n \n I don't believe they are equivalent, really. They are both choices that are made during the pregnancy, but that's about it. I believe it is a wonderful thing that a woman feels she is ready for a child. I believe it is a sad thing that a woman feels she cannot care for a child.\n \n You risked a great deal of turmoil, and a woman who has an abortion risks nothing (generally). I agree that abortion can be and is usually selfish, and I think that sharing your life with a child is selfless (it has it's selfish aspect as well, but I believe in general it is selfless).\n \n I'm not a very judgmental person. I believe those who disagree with me are merely misguided and only must see things as I see them and they'd instantly understand what we must do. I'm a bit of an egomaniac, eh? ;)\n \n \n\n And my point is that many people find ways to afford that car. Maybe I was just DAMN lucky, but a car is more expensive than raising my kids so far has been. Now, if you want to be one of those whackos that has to have all the BEST for their kid, then yeah, it might cost you an arm and a leg\n\n \n They might find ways to afford a car if they must have a car, like I must have one to work and make money to support myself. A car generally has pretty predictable costs though, while with a child you're basically playing the lottery and hoping your kid has no major problems that will cost a lot of money. To me, a car is a lot less risky, especially since you can take it back if it has problems immediately, and get a warranty for farther down the road.\n \n A child provides nothing (materially, a child is usually a joy to parents) unlike a car and there are no guarantees in terms of health and costs. In terms of strict cost/benefits, I would go with the car. This is even without the costs of education thrown in when the kid goes to college. I have no numbers, but my feeling is that a child is more expensive in the long run, and in the short run if the kid has health problems.\n \n That by no means should be a deciding factor on having a child, however. A factor, sure, but that should not be the way you decide to have a kid. At least, it would not be with me.\n \n \n\n BLAH BLAH BLAH You claim support of personal responsibility, but yet can't bring yourself to say that getting pregnant in the first place and keeping the child also falls under personal responsibility\n\n \n Oh, I think that getting pregnant when you are not ready to have a child is very irresponsible, for both parties. I also believe that a woman is beign responsible when she looks at her life and makes a decision, which could be that she is not ready to have and care for a child. It might be \"the easy way out\" and it is in some ways. I believe and abortion is an easier thing than carrying and then birthing it, but I also believe it is a responsible thing to do in some instances.\n \n \n\n Not when it devalues life, sorry\n\n \n Ah, well, I don't believe in devaluing the woman of the relationship by making the fetus more important. If she were my SO, I would value her life more than the fetus inside of her.\n \n \n\n Well, you refer to yourself being pregnant, so I would think that's a logical conclusion. If not, my apologies\n\n \n That would indeed be logical. I am careful to say if I am pregnant, and if I am the husband. No need to apologize, I simply do not wish you to start making assumptions.\n \n \n\n All I meant was this: You brought up the government programs and implied/inferred that at least having an abortion would mean that the government wouldn't have to pick up the tab, and to me that's just a silly excuse to NOT have the child.

Or is it a big decision? WAIT..John Kerry, right? LOL\n\n \n Killing it is ending a life that is attached to the woman and is drawing nutrients out of her. Depending on her circumstances, not having it there can be a huge relief.\n \n \n\n LOL, not at all. But I would say that we are ALL judgemental but since that's considered a bad word nowadays no one wants or likes to admit it. If you weren't, your home would have a revolving door on it for whoever walked by, you'd have countless friends, etc.\n\n \n I am judgemental, but I am very understanding of other's opinions.\n \n \n\n Sounds like a desire for guarantees ;-)\n\n \n A desire for surety in our lives is not wrong :P Certainly better than chaos around every corner.\n \n \n\n HMMMMMMMMMMMM I've heard that women are in fact in control in the area of sex. Not to say that the guy ISN'T, but she definitely can decide IF and HOW. Getting pregnant is the consequence...call it a punishment if you will, but that just goes with responsibility\n\n \n In a relationship, both partners decide if and how. In a healthy relationship, anyway.\n \n I don't believe forcing the responsibility of motherhood is moral. It should be wanted.\n \n \n\n Well, when you look at a fetus as being less than human, I can see the basis in your misguided opinion ;-) No one is talking about the mother's life being in danger anyway...with no risk to the mother's life, there is no need to choose between the value of either life, is there?\n\n \n I don't see the fetus as less than human, any more than I would see an intruder in my home as less than human. I view the fetus as less important than me and my SO, as I would view an intruder as less important than me and my SO.\n \n I am not talking about risk to the mother's life. The fetus would be less important to me than my SO, in every way. If I were a husband, my wife's desires would always come first to me. Her life, her health, her dreams and goals would be more important to me than what is growing inside of her. If they conflict, I would choose her, in every way, over the fetus. I would trust that I would choose a woman (or man, if the case might be) that shared my beliefs about when to have an abortion.",

Explain that phenomenon.\n \n So what, in the opinion of the people here who support a woman's right to abort her baby, makes a baby human?\n\n \n For most of us on the pro-choice side, a woman's right to her own body is very important. Therefore, there would have to be a very good reason to supress that very important right. It is not enough for any life form to have human DNA or to even have the potential to become a full person just like us. The only thing that is important enough that would outweigh a woman's right to her own body is if the fetus is ALREADY close enough to being a person such as ourselves that it would gain rights that might overcome the right of a woman to her own body. For many people, including myself, the critical development that crosses this threshold is the development of a mental existence in the fetus. In other words, there has to be \"somebody home\" in that body, not just a developing body on its own, for us to start weighing in rights for that fetus that might overcome the rights of the woman to her own body. \n \n Indeed, from a 2003 poll listed on pollingreport.com/abortion.html, 84% of Americans polled thought that third trimester abortions should be generally illegal (minus certain exceptions). This would mean that the majority of pro-choice supporters also think third trimester abortions should be restricted.

Traditionally, it seems that pro-life has been defined as no abortions except for very limited exceptions (risk to mothers life, rape, incest, and sometimes risk to mothers health).

I know, I took the your words out of contexts, but the intention toward ZEF remains the same.\n\n I understand what you were saying before, and sadly that is true, but since when have all racists based their opinions on medical evidence? Racist base their opinions on ignorance. Big differance.\n \n \nI can only conclude that the inability to perceive ZEF as human is based on some form a prejudice.\n\n No. You are playing with words and that is why you don't (or won't) understand. You are trying to suggest that the term 'human' has the same meaning as the term 'human being' - and it does not! While a ZEF may be construed as human, it is NOT yet a fully formed human BEING. Your thumb is human. Your thumb is NOT a human being. Again, big differance.\n \n \nTo me, a XXXXX, it seems logical, based on purely biological evidence that ZEF is a unique human being. \n\n Thank you for your honesty, but since when do human beings have a tail, gills like a fish and a heart and webbed appendages like a frog, which is what a ZEF factually has. Why would the developing human body have these three characteristics? The appendix which is a vestigial appendage and functions in our closest ancestor the great apes, chimpanzees and is also found in cows, yet has no function in our own bodies. You are magnifying half-truths just to be able to justify your 'reasoning'. For you, or any other anti-choicer to suggest that all forms of life dealing with humans should be saved is outright hypercritical when you consider the facts. \n \n \nThat is the definition of slavery.\n\n No, that is just one (very outdated) definition. Modern dictionaries (sorry you are afraid to have one Phyllis) in fact say say this:\n \n The state of being dominated: a state of being completely dominated by another. Submission to a dominating influence. The condition of servitude. a condition of submission to or domination by some influence, habit, etc.\n \n \n \nwhat has been magnified is the absurdity of some of the pro-choice apologists, yourself and Chester being particular instances of it.\n\n You are entitled to your opinion, even though it is not based in fact, fact which I might add a logical person would have and use as their cornerstone for reasoning. But you go right ahead and shoot yourself over and over again in the foot by using emotion as your wit emoticon_xgood\n \n \nSo you have to breath air to be a person?\n\n How many people do you know that don't breath? Even a person that is forced to use an artificial iron lung (known today as a positive pressure ventilator) still breaths air. A ZEF does not. Deal with it.\n \n \nWhat happens when I hold my breath?\n\n I don't know. Can we find out? If not then why not? What are you instinctually afraid of? That you'll no longer be a functioning person in the next few minutes? Kind of makes my point now doesn't it? Weird emoticon_idea\n \n \nWhat happens if I'm in an airplane or in space?\n\n How many people do you know that have NEVER come in contact with the ground in their lifetime? Seriously. Find me just one person for which this has been documented. Even a person that is born with no legs and is attached to a wheelchair is still touching Gods green Earth. Your non-logical questions are comical at best. Try again.\n \n \nWhat if I lose my social security card\n\n Not using your cranium to come up with these perposterous situations are you Phyllus? Guess what? You'd have to FIRST have a social security card before you could lose one. DOH!!! emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nAnd you were criticizing the \"anti-choicers'\" reasoning?\n\n ABSOLUTELY!! (if you want to call that \"reasoning\") emoticon_smile\n \n \nRights are not earned. They are entities inherent to every human person\n\n Think maybe you could finish your sentence? It should read \"They are entities inherent to every human person that has been BORN.\" \n \n \nDoes forbidding a mother from killing her born child mean that we have given the child complete control over her?\n\n Seriously, what forum do you think you are posting in? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n No one here is suggesting that a BORN baby be killed. In your blind ignorance you don't even know the difference between a ZEF and a baby that has already been born. Way to go, spoken like a true anti-choicer and we're all proud of you emoticon_xgood\n \n \na pregnant woman can essentially do whatever she wants while she is pregnant.\n\n If it is HER BODY then yes. \n \n \nAll that shows is that if you remove the developing child out of its natural environment before viability, it won't survive.\n\n But wait a minute, if it were a REAL person then that wouldn't be an issue now would it? There is a medical reason why one is called a fetus, and one is called a baby. A basic fact you have yet to learn.\n \n \nJust because something does not enjoy legal rights does not mean they should not have them.\n\n Simple yes or no question: Do you think that a skin graft should have the same rights as a fully born person? Yes or no.\n \n \nthis business about being a slave to the fetus is ridiculous.\n\n The only thing that is ridiculous is your hypothesis. No one but you said the fetus itself was doing this. The fetus is simply a tool used by the anti-choice movement to force the woman to do something against her own will. So yes, it IS ridiculous that these anti-choicers have the audacity to think that they could use a fetus (which is not theirs in any way, shape, or form) against the very woman that is carrying it. \n \n \nEven were a fetus considered to be a person, it is going to be very difficult indeed to prove that the fetus has a will.\n\n If a fetus has no will, then why are you trying to FORCE your agenda and will upon it?\n \n Check-mate emoticon_xbye",

   "...If the pro-choicers can take your argument and show it to have illogical consequences, then theirs is an argument worth using.\n\n There is a difference between illogical consequences and undesired consequences. I think the \"enslavement\" crowd makes this argument based on the latter rather than the former.\n \n \nUsing that argument, however, if a zygote has no provable will how can you prove it has a mental state beyond reflex?\n\n First of all, I don't know why I need to prove it has a mental state beyond reflex. Second of all, I don't know why you are linking the presence of a will with the presence of a mental state. I don't suppose there is any way we could say, for example, that a 1 day old infant has a will.\n \n \nNo, that is just one (very outdated) definition. Modern dictionaries (sorry you are afraid to have one Phyllis) in fact say say this:\n \n The state of being dominated: a state of being completely dominated by another. Submission to a dominating influence. The condition of servitude. a condition of submission to or domination by some influence, habit, etc.\n\n The meaning of slavery in the 13th amendment is the meaning that term had when the amendment was adopted. The United States banned slavery as it was defined by everyone in 1865. They did not ban slavery as you define it here in 2008.\n \n \nBut you go right ahead and shoot yourself over and over again in the foot by using emotion as your wit\n\n I was prone to think that the folks who were stretching the definition of slavery in the 13th Amendment beyond any recognition would be the ones attempting to make an appeal to emotion.\n \n \nHow many people do you know that don't breath? Even a person that is forced to use an artificial iron lung (known today as a positive pressure ventilator) still breaths air. A ZEF does not. Deal with it.\n\n The problem is not everyone breathes all the time. I'm holding my breath right now as I type this little part. Get it? I am not breathing. Am I still a person?\n \n I also suppose that a person unable to breathe due to some medical emergency would still be a person. He might not be alive for very long, but he would still be a person.\n \n \nHow many people do you know that have NEVER come in contact with the ground in their lifetime?\n\n The point is, a person is a person before they touch the ground. Their touching the ground did not make them into a person.\n \n \nNot using your cranium to come up with these perposterous situations are you Phyllus? Guess what? You'd have to FIRST have a social security card before you could lose one.\n\n Believe it or not, there are plenty of people walking around in the world who have never had a social security card. Never ever. In fact, the vast, overwhelming majority of persons throughout world history have not had social security cards. And yet, they are and were most certainly still people. Except, I suppose, to you.\n \n \nThink maybe you could finish your sentence? It should read \"They are entities inherent to every human person that has been BORN.\"\n\n I have a hard time squaring that statement with the fact that a person can be charged with homicide for deliberately causing the death of a fetus absent the exception of abortion. See Scott Peterson.\n \n \nSeriously, what forum do you think you are posting in?\n \n No one here is suggesting that a BORN baby be killed. In your blind ignorance you don't even know the difference between a ZEF and a baby that has already been born. Way to go, spoken like a true anti-choicer and we're all proud of you\n\n In other words, you saw how ridiculous your slavery claim was, and therefore tried to change the subject by impugning my intelligence. The bottom line is that it is impossible for a fetus to enslave a woman.\n \n \nBut wait a minute, if it were a REAL person then that wouldn't be an issue now would it?\n\n Of course it would. Try going up to outer space for a few minutes and see if you can survive outside of your natural environment (that is, without the assistance of any life-sustaining machinery).\n \n \nIf a fetus has no will, then why are you trying to FORCE your agenda and will upon it?\n\n I'm not trying to force my agenda or will upon the fetus. I am trying to force my will and agenda, through the law, on anyone who would seek to harm it though. But this would no more be slavery than would forcing my will and agenda, through the law, against theft be enslaving those who rather would commit theft.\n \n \nCheck-mate\n\n I hope you are better at chess than you are at making the ridiculous argument you've been trying to make here.\n \n \nWebster's first and second definitions are exactly the place the profetallifers would place the pregnant woman.\n\n Required is the \"entire subjection of one person to the will of another.\" Who is the another to whom the pregnant woman would be entirely subjected, chester?",

Maybe that's why you find dictionaries so un-rational, because you don't know how to use them.\n \n Parasite: &#9656; noun: an animal or plant that lives in or on a host; the parasite obtains nourishment from the host without benefiting the host.\n \n Care to see what one of the most renown obstetrics (Williams Obstetrics) says about the matter in their 5000-page medical reference? \n \n \"Fetal villious syncytiotrophoblast is remarkably efficient in extracting and sequestering essential nutrients from maternal circulation. In pregnant women with profound iron-deficiency anemia, for example, the iron stores of the fetus are normal; in pregnant women with severe folic acid deficiency causing severe anemia, the fetal hematocrit is normal. The fetus is a demanding and efficient parasite! Thus..the demands of the embryo are met at whatever cost to the maternal organism. \"\n Williams Obstetrics, 20th Edition (1997), (Chap. 7).\n \n Obviously Archangel you read a couple of pages from a junior high school biology text, and now you seem to think that qualifies you to be \"pre-med\". LOL :p \n \n \"Parasitism is a way of living in which an organsim, the parasite, uses an organism of a different species, the host, both as a habitat and as a food.\"\n ~C.P. Reed - Animal Parasitism. Prentice-Hall 1972. \n \n \"a parasite is an organism living in or on another living organism, obtaining from it part or all of its organic nutriment, commonly exhibiting some degree of adaptive structural modification, and causing some degree of real damage to its host.\" \n ~P.W. Price - Evolutionary Biology of Parasites. Princeton Univ. Press. 1980\n \n A ZEF meets all of these requirments. ZEF = parasite emoticon_xgood\n\n \n What amazes me about this explanation is that you feel emboldened by these clinical definitions that are meant to explain the way the mother feeds her baby in the womb. But you use that information to relegate the human offspring to the level of a parasite which only exists in order to suck the life out of its host. Your rationale is both false and dishonest, unless you're actually simple enough to believe it, then you're just plain ole stupid.\n \n You are describing the only process of propagating the human species, and all species of animal life for that matter as if it is a type of disease which will ultimately kill its host. And yet, if that were the case then NO LIFE AT ALL WOULD EXIST ON EARTH ABOVE THE MICROBIAL LEVEL. \n \n So you can accuse me of relying on a Jr High Biology Text but it's you who has the most ignorant and simplistic interpretation of how life is created that I have ever read. LOLOL emoticon_smile emoticon_rolleyes \n \n You are obviously not intelligent enough to separate the mechanism for growing a new life within the womb of a mammal from the end result of that process which is a living creature that is an equal reflection of the creature that carried it in her womb. Be she animal or human this cycle represents the process of how WE ALL GOT HERE TO THIS POINT OF COMMUNICATING ON THESE KEYBOARDS. How sad it is that you aren't smart enough to appreciate or grasp that reality.\n \n Now, a true parasite, as opposed to a parasitical relationship would be your original comparison to a tapeworm which no matter how long it survives within its host, it remains a parasite. And if allowed to grow perpetually could eventually kill its host. Where as a fetus grows into a human being in an established gestation period of 9 months time. See the difference Ingus? One is a true parasite while the other has a parasitical relationship which is totally natural and normal as proven by the existence of 6+ BILLION human beings on Earth today. So we know the process works more times than it fails. \n \n So my suggestion to you Ingus, is that you go back to 8th grade biology and start over again, and maybe this time you'll learn the difference between an unborn very healthy growing human fetus in its mothers womb, and a Tapeworm like parasite which will devour its host if allowed to grow unchecked. And while you're at it, take chester the thread molester, and penfold with you. They could use a taste of reality too. emoticon_xgood emoticon_rolleyes",

POST 16 clarifies the point I was making very well. But again, morality wasn't the issue at all. Nor was I saying that there were no moral absolutes in this world or anywhere at all as that wasn't the subject being debated. \n \n  [Post 16 by Archangel] Jo, we live in a world where there are exceptions to every rule for ONE reason or another. So your example doesn't conflict with my point at all. But my point stands and could be confirmed by polling every adoptive couple who seeks a baby in any given year. The vast majority of any race polled, to the tune of 99% I would wager, would say that if given their first preference, they would prefer a child of their own race. Of course, if that isn't possible due to the high number of abortions which limit the number of babies that are available, loving parents of any race will take babies of any race. \n \n My point isn't racist at all, it is acknowledging reality and the human nature which causes us to be drawn to those who look like we do. That is an inherent human characteristic that goes back to our very roots. You people are so blinded by modern day political correctness that you've lost the ability to be socially honest or objective.\n \n Note the bolded, it was this sentence which caused me to make the statement regarding no absolutes. And it is plain to see that it had nothing at all to do with moral absolutes. But you know what's going to make you look even more pathetic? That you'll continue to defend your abuse of what I said in order to attempt to make it look like we agree on something.

   "Jumping into the fray here, I would disagree with the idea of moral absolutes but, at the same time, I would aknowledge that there are clear trends in moral views throughout humanity based at least partly on human nature. \n \n Where moral absolutes are concerned, the problem, of course, is WHICH moral rules one chooses to be absolute. Different religions have different moral rules, all of whose proponents consider those absolute since they have trust that their religion reflects the truth. Similarly, 18th and 19th century discussions on natural rights often ran into the problem that philosophers (as well as politicians and laymen) disagreed on which rights would be considered absolute. Major problems are encountered if one tries to base ideas of moral absolutes on either religious belief or gut feeling. \n \n However, just because morality does not work in absolutes, that does not mean that there are no trends in people's moral beliefs. One trend that is VERY common is the idea that one should treat others as one would expect to be treated. It has many versions - ranging from the Golden Rule, to the phrase so often heard by parents telling their children \"How would YOU like it if that happened to you...\". Since our human experiences of physical and emotional suffering are similar, independent of the context, this would automatically lead to trends in moral rules - against murder, theft, etc. \n \n Most of the rest of moral judgement rests on value judgements, and these value judgements often depend on ones initial assumptions, on knowledge one has about the moral situation in question, on the traditions one was brought up with, etc. For example, a major value judgement that determines ones view on first trimester abortion rights is whether one places higher value on a woman's right to her own body (pro-choice) or on the life of a human body that will develop into a person but, up to that point, is merely a body (pro-life). \n \n Taking the example of the Holocaust or slavery, both of these situations were situations where large groups of people were caused significant suffering, where the imposition of that suffering was not necessary and was justified by illogical racist arguements (i.e. that Jews were evil, or that blacks were so mentally incapable that they needed to be governed through slavery).

But all of that is irrelevant to what is actually absolute morality in reality. The great flaw in peoples reasoning is that if they don't accept something as true, right, real or moral, then it doesn't exist to them. That type of thinking is self delusion. It's like atheists insisting there is no God. They are actually ignorant enough to believe that there is no God because they say there isn't one.

   "I agree with your breakdown of the varying human interpretations of what is moral. But all of that is irrelevant to what is actually absolute morality in reality. The great flaw in peoples reasoning is that if they don't accept something as true, right, real or moral, then it doesn't exist to them. That type of thinking is self delusion. It's like atheists insisting there is no God. They are actually ignorant enough to believe that there is no God because they say there isn't one. None of which changes the fact that our Creator God is alive and well on Planet Earth and intimately involved with us and human history. \n\n I am happy for you that you should have the confort of feeling that sense of certainty.

Most people are somewhere in between in that they take some level of a leap of faith, even without evidence. It is a minority of people that have strong confidence in belief despite evidence.

I just happen to understand that absolute morality exists at all which is more than most secular humanists believe which has been asserted by chester on multiple occasions here.\n\n Claiming something is true is not the same as it being true. I know that you have strong confidence in your belief. What you don't get is that you remain utterly unconvincing if you don't support those beliefs with something other than claims of their truth. Don't you see that a wide range of people from various religions also claim strong confidence in their beliefs? Don't you see that, from an outsider's point of view, they can't tell who is right and who is wrong? Other religions also tell people to just start following their path so that the new believers will understand their great truth. What you may not recognize is that new believers often gain confidence in the religion they joined, whether it is Christianity, or Islam, or Hinduism, etc. So, claims that \"God will show you the way\" don't work since people following this principle have found a wide range of beliefs to feel confident in.\n \nAgain, I know this is what they argue. Without evidence they are free to ignore absolute truths. But that ignorance of the absolute in no way nullifies it or negates its ultimate result as absolute truth. It's like the law say's that ignorance is no excuse for breaking the law. So it is with the eternal truths which are as real as the physical laws which secular humanists accept as real and undeniable. \n\n Again, you are claiming that your truths are absolute but, without evidence or reasoned debate, there is no reason why people should believe you. Some people will believe you if they are predisposed that way already, but secular humanists will only believe you if you show evidence or logical reasoning to counter their claims. Either way, I know you won't aknowledge this, but there does exist the possibility that you could be wrong. \n \n As I mentioned in another thread, imagine if you never experienced the spiritual experience which had given you confidence in your new faith. Ask yourself honestly - would you have changed your faith purely on the arguements of Christian missionaries if you never had that spiritual experience? That is what you are expecting others to do. You expect them to just believe you.\n \nActually millions upon millions of believers in Christ have had similar experiences to mine which proved to them that they are not alone in this life. I am definitely not alone in my personal experiences. Only my experiences are unique as they specifically apply to me, but many have experienced similar events that proved to them that both God and absolute spiritual truths are as real as the physical laws which guide Gods Creation. \n\n You are not alone in your view but you may not realize that there are millions upon millions of believers in other religions that ALSO have had spiritual experiences that convince them of the truth of their religion. How do outsiders know who to believe? We don't, so people often either default to the beliefs of their parents or become secular humanists.\n \nActually, the Golden Rule is taken directly from the bible, but has been adopted and applied by secularists, as have most every single moral principle by which humanity lives by in order to maintain an orderly Society. The only aspect of Gods moral principles which is being erased from Society today is God Himself are atheists and secularists who desire to elevate MAN to the position of our own moral guides. This of course is leading to a society of amoral and narcissistic hedonists who believe that if it feels right to that person, then it must be ok to do it. \n\n It is possible that Kant (and other secular moral philosphers) was indeed influenced by the Golden Rule in coming up with has Categorical Imperative. However, I have also heard that similar versions to this golden rule exist in cultures that do not have their origin in Christianity. It is logical to realize that one cannot have a moral rule that applies different rules to oneself than to the rest of humanity. Nobody would ever agree to such a lop-sided deal. It is, therefore, not at all surprising that such a rule of mutual treatment should be so pervasive throughout the world.\n \nAre you actually arguing that the guilt of adopting out a healthy child is greater than knowing she killed her own child in the womb, thereby denying it any life at all? I need evidence that such a scenario is rational, much less likely.\n\n She may not feel the guilt that you would feel in that situation since, in the great majority of the time, abortions are done very early on in the pregnancy while the embryo/fetus has barely even developed - has no mental existence and doesn't even resemble a human being. Most women who undergo abortions apparently mainly feel a sense of relief.\n \nYou mean the anger of being forced to be responsible for their own actions? Do you feel sympathy for the murderer who is sorry they got caught and are facing the legal consequences for their crime?\n\n They are not murderers if they are not killing people. Prior to a mental existence, the fetus is not a person - at least in may view and in the view of MANY others. As for responsibility for their own actions, many women view having an abortion as the responsible thing to do in certain situations. For example, if they have too large of a family already, abortion at an early stage could prevent problems for the people in her family that ALREADY exist (which takes precedence over anything that is done to a body of a person that doesn't even exist yet).\n \nAgain, the moral issue you are ignoring is that it is no longer her body which she is responsible for. It is now an unborn child which will surely grow into a sentient being if allowed to grow which is inside of her.\n \n\n But we obviously disagee about how much responsibility one has over a body that has \"nobody home\". People have responsibility over people, not over bodies. If the woman plans to carry out the pregancy, then there would be responsibility over taking care of that developing body for the person that they plan to soon bring into the world. If she plans to abort, then it would not matter whether she would take care of that early body. Either way, up to the point of mental existence, the only thing she would hurt with abortion is a body, not a person.\n \nYou are arguing a false point since we all know that from the point of the egg being fertilized, it is inevitable that if allowed to complete the gestation cycle, it will result in the birth of a child wich carries the combined genetic features of both parents. To deny that is to deny the reality of what is growing in her womb.\n\n Again, as I have mentinoed in various posts to you, what WILL BE is not the same thing as what IS. Just because an embryo will become a person like you and me doesn't mean that it is one now. Now, it is just a growing soul-less body (i.e. one lacking a mental existence) - the treatment of which is much less important than the treatment of a person.\n \nIrrelevant! they have the responsibility, along with their partner to be responsible only over their own bodies. Once a child is conceived, they have no right to end its life for the sake of their own personal convenience when that choice ends the life of an innocent bystander which the child is since it played no active part in its own conception. You are no different than the other pro abortion apologists when you seek to force that innocent child to pay the ultimate price for their irresponsibility.\n\n You are adding a personality to a fetus before that can ever exist. Again, in early pregnancy, the embryo/fetus is JUST a body with \"nobody home\". Yes, it will likely become a person if left alone but it ISN'T ONE YET. So, since no person has ever yet existed, just a body, you can continue to treat it as what it is - a body - until it gains the critical aspect which makes it a person - i.e. mental existence. Again, once it does have mental existence, then I agree with you that one needs to protect its life (except for certain expections) out of sympathy for that now existing person.",

   "I mean, exactly what crime has an unborn child in the womb had the opportunity to commit\n\n \n Are you really THAT ignorant on this topic? For the most part every ZEF damages a woman's body during pregnancy. For example; I know women that suffered kidney damage. In fact kidney damage is quite common, and the risk of kidney failure increases significantly during pregnancy. Intrauterine infections are also common, as is blood clots and thromboembolic disease. Oedema is common, especially in the legs. Many women get an obstruction of the intestine during a their pregnancy, which can be very serious. The obstruction can easily lead to gangrene of the intestine and peritonitis. The pregnant woman's body goes through many changes to provide whatever the ZEF needs to grow. It does all of this at the woman's expense, just the same as any other parasite would harm its host, so does the fetus. Also, the expectant mother's blood vessels widen, and the volume of water and salt increases in her body causes further health damage to the woman. And of course we're not forgetting that the simple act of being pregnant puts the woman in the highest rate for homicide. \n \n Other issues that can develop are Hyperemesis Gravidarum, Eclampsia, Rh Incompatibility, Preeclampsia, Gestational Diabetes, Peripartum Cardiomyopathy, as well as severe Liver damage. We haven't even started to talk about all of the permanent nerve damage, or all of the skeletal damages to the spinal cord and/or knee cartilage that could cripple a woman for the rest of her life because of the pregnancy. And this is all just a partial list of how a fetus damages a woman's body. Now if anyone was to walk up to you and did bodily damage of any kind to you, it would be listed under an assault. That's EXACTLY what the fetus is doing, it's harming and assaulting the woman's body. Far from being \"innocent\" emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Why is it that all of you lefty's interpret the truth as a flame war? And who are you to determine what is flaming and what isn't? Are you some authority here that we should know about? emoticon_xchickenemoticon_confused\n\n \n Just giving my honest opinion. Its not what you're saying its how you're saying it.\n \n \n \n \nWho are you suggesting is fighting the definition of a parasite? Are you unable to comprehend what I wrote? Or tell the difference between how a fetus is fed and what a true parasite is? Read my post again very carefully, and you will hopefully grasp what I said. If not, that's ok cuz my post speaks for itself. I even bolded the relevant part that most clearly summarizes it for you. Hopefully, that will help you understand the difference between a parasite and a fetus.\n\n \n It doesn't matter what your opinion on what is a parasite and what is not. The English language classifies the ZEF as a parasite. Period. There is not much debating that.\n \n \n \nAs for the dictionary defining a ZEF as a parasite, feel free to post that definition, WITH A LINK, just to support your claim.\n\n \n If you insist:\n \n Parasite: An organism that lives in or on and takes its nourishment from another organism. A parasite cannot live independently. \n \n \n The term \"parasite\" came from the Greek \"parasitos\" (para-, along side of + sitos, food) meaning \"eating at the side of, as at the same table.\" The sense of the term later changed to that of a poor friend or relative who lived at the expense of another. Not until the 18th century did \"parasite\" come into English as a biologic term.\n \n http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4769",

   " \n I mean, exactly what crime has an unborn child in the womb had the opportunity to commit\n\n \nAre you really THAT ignorant on this topic? For the most part every ZEF damages a woman's body during pregnancy. For example; I know women that suffered kidney damage. In fact kidney damage is quite common, and the risk of kidney failure increases significantly during pregnancy. Intrauterine infections are also common, as is blood clots and thromboembolic disease. Oedema is common, especially in the legs. Many women get an obstruction of the intestine during a their pregnancy, which can be very serious. The obstruction can easily lead to gangrene of the intestine and peritonitis. The pregnant woman's body goes through many changes to provide whatever the ZEF needs to grow. It does all of this at the woman's expense, just the same as any other parasite would harm its host, so does the fetus. Also, the expectant mother's blood vessels widen, and the volume of water and salt increases in her body causes further health damage to the woman. And of course we're not forgetting that the simple act of being pregnant puts the woman in the highest rate for homicide. \n \n Other issues that can develop are Hyperemesis Gravidarum, Eclampsia, Rh Incompatibility, Preeclampsia, Gestational Diabetes, Peripartum Cardiomyopathy, as well as severe Liver damage. We haven't even started to talk about all of the permanent nerve damage, or all of the skeletal damages to the spinal cord and/or knee cartilage that could cripple a woman for the rest of her life because of the pregnancy. And this is all just a partial list of how a fetus damages a woman's body. Now if anyone was to walk up to you and did bodily damage of any kind to you, it would be listed under an assault. That's EXACTLY what the fetus is doing, it's harming and assaulting the woman's body. Far from being \"innocent\" emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Hey Ingus, stop running away and respond to our previous debate before starting a new one. Here it is below from post 205. But to respond to this drivel, are you actually blaming the baby for being conceived by its parents who never sought its permission before having sex? Have you absolutely no understanding of the concept of cause and effect? \n \n And are you so dumbed down, morally speaking that you have no understanding of personal responsibility? You speak about pregnancy as if it's a disease like cancer! According to your threat assessment of carrying a baby, you make cancer sound like a walk in the park. And finally, you also reveal how totally clueless and ignorant you are regarding the miracle of PROCREATION WHICH IS THE REASON THE HUMAN RACE CONTINUES TO EXIST. \n \n So you keep focussing on the clinical definitions of what occurs during the human gestation process, but you only look stupid by acting as if the innocent child is guilty of anything just for being conceived through the free will actions of its parents. And for that you argue that it is guilty of something and deserves to be violently killed in the womb. Go figure huh, the allegedly pro-equal and pro-civil rights LEFTISTS strike again with their hypocritical gospel of death. emoticon_frazzled \n \n Now, respond to post 205 if you can!\n You like to romanticize what a parasite is. The fact remains that they both meet the same definition for a parasite. Read 'em and weep.\n \n If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck...\n \n So you're suggesting that DICTIONARIES are not rational? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I'm not leeching off a woman inside her womb, a ZEF is emoticon_xgood \n \n That's not the definition of a parasite. Maybe that's why you find dictionaries so un-rational, because you don't know how to use them.\n \n Parasite: &#9656; noun: an animal or plant that lives in or on a host; the parasite obtains nourishment from the host without benefiting the host.\n \n Care to see what one of the most renown obstetrics (Williams Obstetrics) says about the matter in their 5000-page medical reference? \n \n \"Fetal villious syncytiotrophoblast is remarkably efficient in extracting and sequestering essential nutrients from maternal circulation. In pregnant women with profound iron-deficiency anemia, for example, the iron stores of the fetus are normal; in pregnant women with severe folic acid deficiency causing severe anemia, the fetal hematocrit is normal. The fetus is a demanding and efficient parasite! Thus..the demands of the embryo are met at whatever cost to the maternal organism. \"\n Williams Obstetrics, 20th Edition (1997), (Chap. 7).\n \n Obviously Archangel you read a couple of pages from a junior high school biology text, and now you seem to think that qualifies you to be \"pre-med\". LOL :p \n \n \"Parasitism is a way of living in which an organsim, the parasite, uses an organism of a different species, the host, both as a habitat and as a food.\"\n ~C.P. Reed - Animal Parasitism. Prentice-Hall 1972. \n \n \"a parasite is an organism living in or on another living organism, obtaining from it part or all of its organic nutriment, commonly exhibiting some degree of adaptive structural modification, and causing some degree of real damage to its host.\" \n ~P.W. Price - Evolutionary Biology of Parasites. Princeton Univ. Press. 1980\n \n A ZEF meets all of these requirments. ZEF = parasite emoticon_xgood\n\n \n What amazes me about this explanation is that you feel emboldened by these clinical definitions that are meant to explain the way the mother feeds her baby in the womb. But you use that information to relegate the human offspring to the status of a parasite which only exists in order to suck the life out of its host. Your rationale is both false and dishonest, not to mention totally erroneous. Unless you're actually simple enough to believe it, then you're just plain ole stupid.\n \n You are describing the only process of propagating the human species, and all species of animal life for that matter as if it is a type of disease which will ultimately kill its host. And yet, if that were the case then NO LIFE AT ALL WOULD EXIST ON EARTH ABOVE THE MICROBIAL LEVEL. \n \n So you can accuse me of relying on a Jr High Biology Text but it's you who has the most ignorant and simplistic interpretation of how life is created that I have ever read. LOLOL emoticon_smile emoticon_rolleyes \n \n You are obviously not intelligent enough to separate the mechanism for growing a new life within the womb of a mammal from the end result of that process which is a living creature that is an equal reflection of the creature that carried it in her womb. Be she animal or human this cycle represents the process of how WE ALL GOT HERE TO THIS POINT OF COMMUNICATING ON THESE KEYBOARDS. How sad it is that you aren't smart enough to appreciate or grasp that reality.\n \n Now, a true parasite, as opposed to a parasitical relationship would be your original comparison to a tapeworm which no matter how long it survives within its host, it remains a parasite. And if allowed to grow perpetually could eventually kill its host. Where as a fetus grows into a human being in an established gestation period of 9 months time. See the difference Ingus? One is a true parasite while the other has a parasitical relationship which is totally natural and normal as proven by the existence of 6+ BILLION human beings on Earth today. So we know the process works more times than it fails. \n \n So my suggestion to you Ingus, is that you go back to 8th grade biology and start over again, and maybe this time you'll learn the difference between an unborn very healthy growing human fetus in its mothers womb, and a Tapeworm like parasite which will devour its host if allowed to grow unchecked. And while you're at it, take chester the thread molester, and penfold with you. They could use a taste of reality too. emoticon_xgood emoticon_rolleyes",

If unborn babies are dangerous parasites as Ingus, penfold, chester and shooter all claim, then as we humans always do, we should fix this problem. And you rightly focused right in on the source of the problem by singling out the male testicles as the organs which produce the invasive microbes, which once implanted into the poor unsuspecting female, is victimized by the completely unexpected growth of this foreign parasite that attempts to take over her body in such a violent and invasive way. From that point of view, one must thank God for the abortion procedure. And if true, then not enough of them take place in reality. If ZEFs are in fact true parasites, then they all should be forcibly removed from the women who's bodies they have invaded.\n \n So what to do is the question. How do we avoid this infection from continuing in the females of the human race? The only real solution seems to be full on castration of every male child. And it seems to me that due to the trauma of such an invasive operation, such an operation should be performed at the same time as boys foreskins are removed for sanitary purposes immediately after birth. Of course, the result of such a move if enforced on an International scale would lead to the complete extinction of the human race within one generation, but hey, we would also rid the world of those pesky parasites which invade the females of our species on such a regular basis. \n \n How's that for a solution LEFTISTS? Is that a solution you could support? And you would kill 2 birds with one stone as this ridiculous debate about abortions would also disappear all together. Please respond to this suggestion and tell me how you would vote on such an amendment. Maybe for once, we can actually come to a positive conclusion on one of these debates and agree on a universal solution which everyone can live with; or die with. \n \n Or maybe you'll finally admit that you are lacking the understanding of a preschooler to even dare to suggest with a straight face, that our unborn human offspring are parasites. emoticon_xdonno",

   "A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:\n \n THE PRO-ABORTION AGENDA OF JUSTIFICATION THROUGH DEHUMANIZATION\n \n To those people who are attempting to rationally debate the issue of ABORTION with these pro-death secular humanists and atheists, it is very important that you understand their true agenda and modus operandi for justifying the procedure which murders unborn babies while still in their mothers wombs.\n \n The method for justification requires that they dehumanize the unborn children which is why they will refer to them as ZEFs and Zygotes. And is why they will use comparisons to the fertilized and unfertilized chicken egg, which we eat for breakfast. You see, either way, when debating this issue on such a simplistic level, they win by default because they have already lowered the standard of debate to that of a chicken egg.\n \n So, by just understanding the shallowness of their tactics, we win by not allowing them to dehumanize our human offspring to the status of an inhuman analogy. Remember that these people are attempting to justify the murder of our very own human offspring. And they know that as well as you and I do. What they must do is both justify their stance and maintain a clear conscience so they don't have to live with the guilt that they are in fact defenders of a pro murder philosophy.\n \n That is why no matter what common sense arguments you use with them, no matter how obvious and rational your reasoning, they will never accept or concede that their position is not only false and irrational, but is criminal and a pro-death philosophy which supports and encourages genocide. After all, it is painfully obvious that any doctrine which not only allows, but enables the killing of 1.4 million members of one particular class of American consistently, year after year can be described as nothing other than genocide.\n \n That is why they must dehumanize the unborn, because they don't want to admit that they are proponents of the Great American Genocide. So forgive them for their irrational debating style which results in them offering the most infantile and ignorant arguments in their attempts to justify their sociopathic and shortsighted gospel of death and destruction of our most innocent and silent demographic, who have no personal voice of their own with which to defend themselves. \n \n What better a group to victimize than the absolute weakest among us? And they are even out of sight, so also out of mind of the masses. If they can only be dehumanized, then justifying their extermination should be easy according to the proponents of this MULTI BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL INDUSTRY. So by understanding the rationale of these opponents of life for the unborn, you are more prepared to deal with the ignorance and shallowness of their inane attempts to justify such human carnage on such a massive scale. \n \n Just understand that these proponents of ABORTION are also victims since they have been raised in a selfish and self centered Society to believe that personal responsibility is a thing of the past, so demanding that the innocent child pay with its very life, the price for the sins of its mother/parents is just fine. And if they can moralize it by dehumanizing the baby so they can feel as though it is justified, then all the better. ",

   "What you say is a well balanced view of the pravailing argument. Except for one thing..that you give the argument that a fetus has anything in common with a parasite at all.\n A fetus is created in the body and expelled through a tube between the legs , so is a turd! How seroiusly would you consider this theory?\n\n Here, I was trying to differentiate between the way a term (in this case, parasite) is officially defined compared to the way it is commonly used.\n \n The official definition of parasite is (from the Myrriam-Webster online dictionary):\n 1 : a person who exploits the hospitality of the rich and earns welcome by flattery \n 2 : an organism living in, with, or on another organism in parasitism \n 3 : something that resembles a biological parasite in dependence on something else for existence or support without making a useful or adequate return \n \n Technically, one might classify the fetus as a parasite in this case since it does seem to fit definitions 2 and/or 3 - ex. that it is indeed a living organism living in another organism. So, I would agree with those here who argue that technically it fits the definition. However, we all know that there are various automatically assumed meanings that get attached to words and, therefore, using the term \"parasite\" for a fetus is quite misleading. Every other instance of the use of the term parasite (at least that I have ever heard mentioned) carries all of the connotations listed in my earlier post - connotations that do not apply to the embryo/fetus. So, once again, calling a fetus a parasite might be technically correct but practically misleading - so I would object to calling it a parasite.",

   "Contrary to some peoples slights I do own a dictionary, although I am familiar enough with my own language not to have to refer to it very often! I usually get the words right but not necessarily in the correct order( missed that lesson apparently).\n In fact the dictionary that I own is the Oxford English dictionary printed by the Oxford university press( An English dictionary printed in England by one of the two major seats of learning in the country..beat that!)\n Parasite..1 an organism living in or on another and benefiting at the expense of the other. \n If the fetus is an organism living in or on another organism then by definition is a seperate entity from the host( mother) therefore abortion amounts to killing another seperate creature, we just cant have that , the pro choice cannot accept that.Also if a mother exclusively suckles her baby by this definition the baby will be a parasite long after it is born.\n \n \n benefitting at the expense of the of the other...well they do that long after birth. This would make them a parasite up to the point that they leave home...so obviously that would be nonsense . Comparing your strapping 16 year old with a tape worm is silly..lacking sense, foolish,imprudent, unwise\n ( Oxford English dictionary)\n \n However definition no 2( there are only 2 and as this is the Oxford English dictionary so there ARE only 2, no arguing!) is a person who lives off or exploits another or others ..so there we have it despite my lack of education I have solved the problem..it is not the fetus that is the parasite it the teenager.\n Should we cull them?

   "I place no importance on the fetus's ability to care for itself, to communicate, or to long-term survive, so your arguement here is irrelevant. \n\n \n My argument isn't irrelevant just because you reject it Ao. All that means is that you reject it for no good reason.\n \n \nWhat I do place most value on is what it is at that moment - is it a person or just a body with \"nobody home\". In early stages of pregnancy, it is just a body with \"nobody home\".\n\n \n I would challenge you to prove that Ao, as I have explained why I believe a fertilized egg is alive and human from conception which you haven't even attempted to challenge with a rational response.\n \n \n Following along that comparison, if you are building a home, then it is not that bad if someone bombs it before there is anyone inside. Once there are people inside, then it is far worse to destroy it. \n\n \n REALLY? Is it not arson and a very serious crime to burn a house down whether it is occupied or not? If someone dies in that event, it brings an added charge of murder. But even empty, it's a serious crime to either burn or blow up an empty home.\n \n \nAnd as for your last comment, once again, one cannot equate what WILL BE with what IS. Just because that body will someday develop into a person doesn't mean that it is a person NOW. Because of that potential, it deserves more respect and value than a blob of flesh, but certainly less than a person deserves.\n\n \n This paragraph is a completely subjective statement which isn't consistent with reality in the way the LAW deals with the unborn. If a woman who is just 4 or 6 weeks pregnant and is killed by a drunk driver, he is charged with killing 2 people. If she is murdered for any reason by an aggressor, he will be charged for killing 2 people, not just one. \n \n So it seems that the determination of whether the unborn have value or not legally speaking is based solely on whether its mother intends to keep it. And that my friend is a totally arbitrary and inconsistent standard by which to determine if the unborn are people or not. \n \n \nIt is not a matter of definitions. It is a matter of analysing what we are at our core - what is the escence of us that we cannot do without. What we are at our core is our mental selves. Before we mentally exist, we don't exist - just our bodies. I have followed this line of reasoning for many years because it makes complete sense to me and since nobody has presented any arguements that refute that, outside of mere unsupported proclamations. I am quite happy and content with these views - no reservations, no guilt - because it makes most sense.\n\n \n Regarding the bolded, I agree with you and submit that it is precisely what a fertilized egg is at its very core that proves that it is deserving of human rights and protections. And the evidence of that is over 6 BILLION human beings on Earth as we speak who all started out exactly where that egg is today and all 6 billion are now sentient beings just as you are within the very core of your being.\n \n If as a scientific mind, you require repeatable evidence to come to a conclusion, then how can you deny what a fertilized egg is in reality and still claim to have a grip on reality? You have 6+ BILLION copies of what an egg grows into as evidence of what we all are at that stage of life. How can you then say that these fertilized eggs are less than you are? \n \n Regarding the rest of the paragraph, again, prove it. Prove that a mental existence is required before respecting the person that unborn child will become if only allowed to mature through its gestation cycle. Who are you or anyone else to arbitrarily determine the time frame when an unborn child is worth allowing to live. What right does anyone have to decide that a growing fetus in its mothers womb is not a person due to its stage of development? It makes absolutely no sense to me at all that people can know exactly what that unborn child will become if allowed to grow for just 9 months, yet you have the hubris to determine that it isn't worthy of human rights.",

   "My argument isn't irrelevant just because you reject it Ao. All that means is that you reject it for no good reason.\n\n Your argument was a strawman since it suggested that my reason for rejecting the rights of fetuses is because they could not communicate or take care of themselves. Since I never argued those conditions, I exposed that strawman arguement - invalidating it.\n \nI would challenge you to prove that Ao, as I have explained why I believe a fertilized egg is alive and human from conception which you haven't even attempted to challenge with a rational response.\n\n As I have told you in numerous posts in various ways, it is not life itself that I find important but what type of life it is - a body with \"nobody home\" or a body WITH \"somebody home\" (i.e. a mental existence). Since I have repeated this arguement to you in so many posts already in various threads, perhaps you could tell me SPECIFICALLY what it is about that arguement that you are not following, referring to the statement itself. I will then be happy to re-explain it in a way that you can undertand. Whether or not you agree with the statement, it is important that you at least try to understand my arguement (as I try to understand yours, whether or not I agree with your argument). \n \nREALLY? Is it not arson and a very serious crime to burn a house down whether it is occupied or not? If someone dies in that event, it brings an added charge of murder. But even empty, it's a serious crime to either burn or blow up an empty home.\n\n If you own the house, you are welcome to blow it up (as long as you don't claim insurance on it, and exercise proper safety precautions). In the parallel, who else would own the fetus's body before the fetus starts existing as a person? The mother, of course, whose body it is in. \n \nThis paragraph is a completely subjective statement which isn't consistent with reality in the way the LAW deals with the unborn. If a woman who is just 4 or 6 weeks pregnant and is killed by a drunk driver, he is charged with killing 2 people. If she is murdered for any reason by an aggressor, he will be charged for killing 2 people, not just one. \n\n The law is inconsistent and I personally disagree with it (unless the fetus is third trimester). Your side would like to make it consistent for all laws to make fetuses into people. Our side would like to make the laws consistent to keep fetuses from being considered people - at least not in the first or second trimester. Your side was able to slip that law in to cause the beginning of a slippery slope. Of course, our side will have none of it.\n \n Either way, arguing laws themselves is useless if we don't first argue out some common basis of morality to base them on. Otherwise, laws just become different people's interpretation where the currently most politically strong side wins. I am far more interested in discussing the moral aspect than I am in discussing the details of political maneuvering.\n \nSo it seems that the determination of whether the unborn have value or not legally speaking is based solely on whether its mother intends to keep it. And that my friend is a totally arbitrary and inconsistent standard by which to determine if the unborn are people or not. \n\n Legally speaking, the law should (in my view) only interfere in a woman's right to her own body once there are two people involved - where mental existence is a requirement, in my view, for a person to exist (which can start happening around the beginning of the third trimester). Up to that point in pregnancy, we outsiders can value whatever we want but it is up to the woman to decide on what happens to HER body based on what she values. \n \nRegarding the bolded, I agree with you and submit that it is precisely what a fertilized egg is at its very core that proves that it is deserving of human rights and protections. And the evidence of that is over 6 BILLION human beings on Earth as we speak who all started out exactly where that egg is today and all 6 billion are now sentient beings just as you are within the very core of your being.\n\n Again, we started out as eggs but, if we had stayed eggs, we never would have become people so, AT THAT MOMENT, an egg is not a person. Just because it will become a person doesn't mean it is a person at that point. As I keep saying, what WILL BE is not the same as what IS.\n \nIf as a scientific mind, you require repeatable evidence to come to a conclusion, then how can you deny what a fertilized egg is in reality and still claim to have a grip on reality? You have 6+ BILLION copies of what an egg grows into as evidence of what we all are at that stage of life. How can you then say that these fertilized eggs are less than you are? \n\n Because what IS is not the same as what WILL BE. How much would you value that egg if it never grew into a full human? My guess is not much. You seem to value it for what it will be, not for what it is at that moment.\n \nRegarding the rest of the paragraph, again, prove it. Prove that a mental existence is required before respecting the person that unborn child will become if only allowed to mature through its gestation cycle. Who are you or anyone else to arbitrarily determine the time frame when an unborn child is worth allowing to live.

It makes absolutely no sense to me at all that people can know exactly what that unborn child will become if allowed to grow for just 9 months, yet you have the hubris to determine that it isn't worthy of human rights.\n\n I could hypothetically argue the same thing about unfertilized eggs. WHat hubris of you to say that unfertilized eggs don't deserve rights. I am sure that such an arguement sounds absurd to you. It is precisely as absurd as your arguement sounds to me.\n \n THe reason that I state that it is mental existence that is critical is that I view that as the basis of what we are. At the end of our lives, once we no longer mentally exist, then you might as well unplug the body and throw it away (with proper ritual to satisfy the loved ones left behind) since we, as people, no longer exist. The same is true at the beginning of life. We don't exist until we do so mentally.",

This is the stuff of the anti-choice movement's famous cartoons pretending that a ''baby'' right out of a Good Housekeeping ad is killed on the verge of live birth. Nothing could be further from the truth!\n \n In reality, the fetus involved in late term abortions are often already brain-dead or otherwise hopelessly flawed, and the procedure protects the woman's health, including her ability to have children in the future. Late term abortions may also be used to remove a fetus that is already deceased, but they don't tell you that part in the anti-choice brochures. \n \n Anti-choicers try to scare people by making up non-medical words like 'partial birth abortion'. But even these kinds of mislabeled abortions are very, very rarely used. In-fact it's way less than 1%... not even a minuscule 1/4th of 1%... even less than 1/8th of 1%, - but anti-choicers make it sound like it's a common proceedure, when in-fact it is far from that. Only around 0.08% of abortions are performed after 24 weeks, and 71% of the women who had them did not even know that they were pregnant. The reality is that not all women deliberately wait to have their abortions, as some anti-choicers will have you try to believe. There are many very good medical reasons why a woman would not even be aware that she was pregnant. Some of these reasons are;\n [*] women who menstruate irregularly or not at all due to illness, medication, or strenuous athletic activity; [*] women who believe their absent periods reflect the onset of menopause; [*] women with normally light periods, who mistake spotting that occurs in early pregnancy for menstruation; [*] women who believe they cannot become pregnant because they are nursing babies or undergoing medical treatment; [*] women whose pregnancies are initially -- sometimes repeatedly -- misdiagnosed by physicians or other practitioners. \n There are also other very good reasons why a woman might wait to have an abortion, like for example financial reasons. In one study of women who were having an abortion at 16 weeks, a substantial percentage of them said the delay occurred because they simply needed time to raise the money. Certainly in this bad economy we can all understand and relate to this. The simple fact of the matter is that almost 90% of abortions are performed in the very first trimester of pregnancy (in the first 12 weeks after the first day of the last menstrual period) and more than half of those are performed before 9 weeks. There are also some very good legitimate reasons for late term abortion besides the ones mentioned above, one is called Hydrocephalus, but the anti-choice movement doesn't want you to learn about it because it undercuts their argument, which is why they NEVER mention it before they preface a question like the one asked above. Hydrocephalus is when a fetus has abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the cavities of the brain. The fetuses head may expand to a abnormally large radius of up to 250% of a normal skull at birth, making it impossible for it to pass through the cervix. \n \n Eventually the pregnant woman would die without this late term procedure.\n \n The life of the mother should always take precedence. Not only that but because of the abnormally large amount of fluid accumulating in the fetuses skull, compression of the brain by the accumulating fluid eventually causes irreversible brain damage, and other life threatening complications for the fetus. As the hydrocephalus progresses, torpor (a non-physiological state) sets in. Around 90% of fetuses with spina bifida usually end up with Hydrocephalus. So as you can see when a late term abortion like this is used, it does NOT happen on a \"normal\" fetus. The fetus usually already has irreversible brain damage or is already dead. That's a LOT different than the cartoons used by the anti-choice movement where they try to trick you into thinking that the fetus was right out of a Good Housekeeping ad. Questions like the one above, when not kept in context, are nothing more than pure propaganda used to scare non-medical people into whipping up visions of torture on perfect fetuses, and nothing could be further from the truth! Late term abortions are RARELY ever performed, and when they are performed it is on abnormal fetuses and/or to save the woman's life.",

Not only that but because of the abnormally large amount of fluid accumulating in the fetuses skull, compression of the brain by the accumulating fluid eventually causes irreversible brain damage, and other life threatening complications for the fetus. As the hydrocephalus progresses, torpor (a non-physiological state) sets in. Around 90% of fetuses with spina bifida usually end up with Hydrocephalus. So as you can see when a late term abortion like this is used, it does NOT happen on a \"normal\" fetus. The fetus usually already has irreversible brain damage or is already dead. That's a LOT different than the cartoons used by the anti-choice movement where they try to trick you into thinking that the fetus was right out of a Good Housekeeping ad. Questions like the one above, when not kept in context, are nothing more than pure propaganda used to scare non-medical people into whipping up visions of torture on perfect fetuses, and nothing could be further from the truth! Late term abortions are RARELY ever performed, and when they are performed it is on abnormal fetuses and/or to save the woman's life.\n\n \n Why did you not post the full quote which would have put the question that I asked into context then purport to put it into context?\n I had a perfectly good answer to a pertinent question when the man who thinks babies and tapeworms have a common purpose puts his tiny piece of poison onto the thread! Still smarting maybe?",

   "Another opinion\n At what point do you think that the mother should NOT be allowed to terminate?\n I asked Chester roughly the same question. This is not a kind of trick question. I am genuinely interested in your opinion!\n\n I don't place ABSOLUTE restrictions on any point in pregnancy. However, I would restrict abortions in the third trimester to a limited number of reasons - some of which are also agreed to by many on the pro-life side. These include: risk to mother's life, significant risk to mother's health, rape, incest, mercy killing (the fetus is severely deformed, etc.). Those are the ones that come most readily to mind. Indeed, as I have heard, the majority of abortions performed late term are already among those reasons. After all, a woman who even cares nothing about the late term fetus would herself not want to go through a late term abortion because of the health risks and because of the difficulty in getting someone to perform it. Nevertheless, even though the number of abortions performed for reasons that I would consider unjustified is quite small, I would still be open to the state introducting restrictions on late term abortions (as long as the restrictions did not introduce wording that could act as a slippery slope to outlaw all abortions). Indeed, the United Kingdom does restrict late term abortions - which has caused the abortion debate to quiet down compared to its previous state and the state it is in the US. Most of Europe has second and third trimester restrictions, but allows abortions in the first trimester.",
