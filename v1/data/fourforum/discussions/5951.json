I quote from one of them: \n \n \nIn response to continuing inquiries about the alleged Marian apparitions at Garabandal, Spain, the local bishop, Msgr. Jose Vilaplaua of Santander, released the following statement Oct. 11, 1996, on the 36-year-old event. \n \"Some people have been coming directly to the Diocese of Santander (Spain) asking about the alleged apparitions of Garabandal and especially for the answer about the position of the hierarchy of the Church concerning these apparitions.\n \n \"I need to communicate that:\n \n \"1. All the bishops of the diocese since 1961 through 1970 agreed that there was no supernatural validity for the apparitions.\n \n \"2. In the month of December of 1977 Bishop Dal Val of Santander, in union with his predecessors, stated that in the six years of being Bishop of Santander there were no new phenomena.\n \n \"3. The same bishop, Dal Val, let a few years go by to allow the confusion or fanaticism to settle down, and then he initiated a commission to examine the apparitions in more depth. The conclusion of the commission agreed with the findings of the previous bishops, that there was no supernatural validity to such apparitions.\"\n\n \n http://www.ewtn.com/library/BISHOPS/GARABAND.HTM\n \n It remains a matter of sociological interest that (a) such 'visions' are almost always claimed by adolescent girls, and (b) that in the 21st century superstition is still so potent that whole communities accept their reality.",

   "Bigotry, Discrimination, and Hypocrisy (are) 21st century evangelical christian family values\n\n \n Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines, that seeks to elevate the ways and \"wisdom\" of man above the wisdom and desires of God. It's principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are \"revisited\" through suspect liberal \"scholarship\" or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of today's liberal elitists .\n The genesis of today's liberal fundamentalists were the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and \"free-love\", illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat, and tears and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt.\n \n Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice were foreign concepts to them. \"Right and wrong\", \"good and evil\" were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than it \"feels good, so let's do it\". The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their carnal minds was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values.\n \n One of the most revered mantras of the liberal fundamentalists is \"equality\". The net effect of this experiment was to elevate women via the degradation of men; promote racial equality by instituting racial-based preferences and reverse-discrimination; engender class warfare against people of means via the redistribution of wealth (a concept centered in greed for other people's money, rather than relying on one's own personal initiative and work ethic); and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, and other immoral lifestyles) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal \"tolerance\". However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a corrupted partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. Therefore they are hypocites as well as demagogues. \n \n Rather than truly embrace \"freedom\", liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses which are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUV's, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools, embrace a de-facto litmus test against possible pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, seek to squelch religious speech via \"hate-speech\" laws, and generally engage in a whole range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values.\n \n Liberal fundamentalism undermines the basic effectiveness of the government, legislatures, and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence. ",
