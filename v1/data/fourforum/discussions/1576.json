   "A master of primitive technology and a specialist in native living skills, Ray Mears regulary teaches and lectures on the outdoors and stars in his own TV series: Ray Mears World of Survival.He grew up near the North Downs in England.\n I have watched as many of his programs as I could and have recently bought his Outdoor Survival Handbook. In his TV series and books, he portrays how the Native Indians of America used the natural resources available and how to use them for food, shelter, warmth and navigation. He also shows techniques used by the aboriginal tribes of Australia and military survival techniques of the British and Scandinavian armies.For me, even just watching and reading about his skill in the wild gives me a sense of freedom and longing to just go out and experience nature's wonders for myself. \n People who are softened by civilisation and the big cities see the wilderness as a daunting and harsh place, but in fact, to the trained eye it is man's greatest tool. Ray Mears teaches how we can gather and utilise nature's materials and resourses without causing damage to the environment.\n There is so much I could say about Ray Mears. He is one of the people whom I have most respect for, and I hope I can use some his lessons to bring me closer to nature. This thread is ideally placed, surrounded by threads which doubt and undermine the fact that we humans are contributing to global warming and the destruction of the natural habitat of not just us, but also of our brothers and sisters in the natural world.\n \n Here is to Ray Mears and all others who treat nature with such great respect!!\n emoticon_xhoho emoticon_xgood \n \n Please add your opinion!\n Thank you! emoticon_xgood",
