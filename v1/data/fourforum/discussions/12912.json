   "More Than 800 Gun Buyers on Terrorist Watch List \n \n Monday, June 22, 2009 5:40 PM\n \n Article Font Size \n \n \n \n \n \n \n WASHINGTON -- More than 800 gun purchases were approved after background checks in the last five years even though the buyers' names were on the government's terrorist watch list, investigators said Monday. \n \n \n Being on the watch list is not among the nine factors, such as a felony conviction, that disqualify someone from buying a gun under federal law. More than 900 background checks between February 2004 and February 2009 turned up names on the watch list, and all but 98 were allowed to go through. \n \n \n The watch list _ maintained by the FBI and used by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies _ is meant to identify known or suspected terrorists. However, the list has drawn criticism over the years for mistakes that have led to questioning and searches of innocent people. \n \n \n The Government Accountability Office, the watchdog arm of Congress, provided the updated statistics in a new report. The GAO issued a report on the watch-list loophole in 2005, but no changes have been made to the law. \n \n \n \"The current law simply defies common sense,\" Sen. Frank Lautenberg said in a statement Monday. \n \n \n Lautenberg, D-N.J., has been calling for years to close the \"terror gap\" in the gun law and introduced legislation Monday to address this concern. \"Known and suspected terrorists are exploiting a major loophole in our law, threatening our families and our communities,\" he said. \n \n \n The FBI plans to analyze where people on the watch list are trying to purchase guns as well as other information, the GAO said. \n \n \n There are about 400,000 people on the terror watch list, according to the FBI. Over the past two years, the agency has looked at 830 people who believe they are on the watch list by mistake. For privacy and national security reasons, the FBI does not acknowledge whether a person has been removed from the list. \n \n \n The top lobbyist for the National Rifle Association said the terrorist watch list has poor integrity. \n \n \n \"Law-abiding Americans should not be treated like terrorists,\" the NRA's Chris Cox said. \"To deny law-abiding people due process and their Second Amendment rights based on a secret list is not how we do things in America.\" \n \n In 2007, the Justice Department supported legislation that would address the gap, but Congress did not act on it. \n \n \n The Justice Department is reviewing Lautenberg's bill, department spokesman Dean Boyd said. \n \n \u00a9 2009 Associated Press",

   "People on terrorist watch list allowed to buy guns - CNN.com\n \n WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When people on the government's terrorist watch list have tried to buy guns or explosives in recent years, the government has let them the vast majority of the time.\n \n Current law doesn't stop firearm or explosives sales to people whose names are on the terrorist watch list.\n \n That's the finding of a new report by the Government Accountability Office, sent to lawmakers last month and released publicly Monday.\n \n From February 2004 to February 2009, 963 background checks using the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System \"resulted in valid matches with terrorist watch list records; of these matches, approximately 90 percent were allowed to proceed because the checks revealed no prohibiting information,\" the GAO report says. About 10 percent were denied.\n \n \"Under current law, there is no basis to automatically prohibit a person from possessing firearms or explosives because they appear on the terrorist watch list,\" wrote the GAO's director of homeland security and justice issues, Eileen R. Larence.\n \n \"Rather, there must be a disqualifying factor (i.e., prohibiting information) pursuant to federal or state law, such as a felony conviction or illegal immigration status.\"\n \n Of the 963 background checks, 865 were allowed to proceed, and 98 were denied, the report said.\n \n The GAO provided the report in response to a request from Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey. The GAO said Lautenberg had requested an update to a 2005 report.\n \n In a statement Monday, Lautenberg said, \"this new report is proof positive that known and suspected terrorists are exploiting a major loophole in our law, threatening our families and our communities. This 'terror gap' has been open too long, and our national security demands that we shut it down.\"\n \n The statement said Lautenberg is introducing legislation that would give the U.S. attorney general \"authority to stop the sale of guns or explosives to terrorists.\"\n \n However, an official with the National Rifle Association, the leading lobbyist group that espouses gun ownership rights, said problems with the terror watch list made a broad prohibition likely to violate the rights of law-abiding citizens.\n \n \"The integrity of the terror watch list is poor, as it mistakenly contains the names of many men and women, including some high-profile Americans, who have not violated the law,\" said a statement by Chris W. Cox, the NRA chief lobbyist. \"In fact, a March 2009 report by the inspector general of the Department of Justice concluded that many people whose names were mistakenly placed on the list remain there even after their cases have been vetted and closed.\"\n \n The GAO notes that being on a terrorist watch list does not mean that someone is involved in any terrorist activity.\n \n Last month, the Justice Department reported that the FBI had kept thousands of names on its watch list based on outdated information and should have removed them.\n \n Terrorists have access to BILLIONS of dollars. They're known to have access to high explosives, rocket launchers and RPGs. Why the hell would these powerful entities bother to come to America, adopt false identities and go through lots of paperwork, just to get inferior weaponry?",

   "Last month, the Justice Department reported that the FBI had kept thousands of names on its watch list based on outdated information and should have removed them.\n \n In other words with out due process of any kind nor a resort to clear your name, people are on a list. A terrorist list often with out knowledge of how they got there. Or even if they are on there. Yet we the people are supposed to trust \"big brother\" to be honest. Now lautenberg and the rest of jackals are rushing to ensure you will lose any rights you may have had prior to being placed on this list. ",
