   "This is going to be bitter winter in the Ukraine sending shivers down European spine. I guess Ukraine should be better part of Russia to have 100% guarantee of Russian gas safely go to Europe. LOL That Ukrainian pie Yuschenko, he may well par notorious Milosevic. He is similarly leading his country to chaos (and he is inviting rest of Europe to this abyss too). The difference is that Yuschenko is in possession of big money he is reluctant to spend to pay appropriate rates for Russian gas and invest into making life better in the Ukraine. He's corrupt and he's not the politician and business partner to rely upon. This is bitter piece of truth. \n His biggest gaffe was when he threatened 'to exempt' the transit Russian gas destined for Europe and paid by European taxpayers! Disgusting! As a French taxpayer I'm waiting for apologies and explanations from Ukrainian leader. Me, my family and many other people living in France, we aren't going to stay in cold houses to support Yuschenko independence drive!\n I am sure most ordinary Ukrainians are thinking the same way. Actually I take sympathy for the Ukrainian people as a whole. Btw are they aware of EU officials debating halt of Ukrainian immigrants flow into our lands? For many of them it'll be hard enough blow. Again this is all due to Yuschenko. Though frankly speaking, let Ukrainians stay in their country and built their life there and firm up their democracy there. Wasn't the decision to embrace Ukraine into EU a hasty one? I guess it was. The country has still a long way to go to mature... I had always expected no recent gains from this orange revolution in Kiev. Still it had never occurred to me it may be that bad.",
