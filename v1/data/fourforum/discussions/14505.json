   "I was given the DVD boxed set of The Wire, and I've just finished watching it.\n \n It paints a portrait of total disfunction in society, and it has been hailed as accurate by people who know Baltimore (the city where it is set). The thing I'm curious about is whether, if someone had the time and money, a similar picture could be painted of a segment of any society. Is there a department in France, or a local authority in the UK, or an Indian state that is so chronically messed up? Some of the machinations make bribery seem honest and straightforward, and everyone involved is compelled by their own self-interest to perpetuate the system, and are so bound in to the point where even attempting to blow the whole thing open would end up with them showered in XXXX and the machine rumbling on without them.\n \n It's tempting to blame the degree to which institutions are bound together at a local level in the US (police, schools, waste disposal etc.), or the effect of directly elected mayors, the politicisation of race, whatever. I don't want to do that, because I might be missing something more fundamental about human society.\n \n I guess I have two main things I want to discuss:\n 1. Do you think The Wire tells a true tale of some part of American society?\n 2. Are other societies just as disfunctional?",

   "Jo,\n \n When you said France I thought of this film:\n \n La haine (1995)\n \n No exactly the same thing but \"The Wire\" makes Baltimore look a horror and \"Hate\" does some of the same thing for Paris.\n \n YMMV\n \n Enjoy.emoticon_xhoho",
