   "Quoting something posted in another thread:\nI am as convinced that carrying is an overreaction\n\n \n Carrying is NOT a \"overreaction\" any more than wearing a seatbelt is a \"overreaction\" to a car accident or buying a fire extinguisher is an \"overreaction\" to your house burning down. It is a PREVENTATIVE measure. It only works effectively if it is done BEFORE the requirement. \n \n This is why you see police officers carry their firearms with them. An officer wouldn't be very effective if he decided to \"react\" to an armed assailant by deciding to carry a firearm with him \"next\" time, would he?\n \n This is why I even find the idea of calling the police to save you from a dire situation to be completely hilarious. Look at it (using your \"reality\" glasses not your \"feeling\" ones)\n \n Dangerous, unplanned, violent encounter happens:\n \n I think I'll call police so they may come from far away...and prevent (?!?) this situation from happening!\n \n How do you prevent something from happening AFTER it begins? Yet, people honestly believe POLICE EXIST TO PROTECT THEM! HA! HA! HA! \n \n I laugh! It's HILARIOUS how folks can brainwash themselves into believing the most astounding things! They honestly believe police are for protection, while they acknowledge that the police have to be called IN REACTION to something happening!\n \n Answer this: How can police stop something from happening when they have to REACT to the very thing they are supposed to prevent?\n \n Is it possible to call the police for murder, BEFORE it happens? Can you call the cops BEFORE you get killed?\n \n BBBBRING!\n \n Operator: \"Hello, 911. What's your emergency?\"\n \n Anti: \"Yes, operator. I'd like the police to prevent my murder.\"\n \n Operator: \"Where are you located? Are you in danger?\"\n \n Anti: \"Well, I'm just walking down the street, but I figured I'd call the cops to prevent my random killing.\"\n \n Operator: \"So, you aren't being assaulted at the moment?\"\n \n Anti: \"No.\"\n \n Operator: \"You don't see anything illegal happening, right now?\"\n \n Anti: \"No.\"\n \n Operator: \"You do know 911 is for emergencies only, right?\"\n \n Anti: \"Well, if I get killed, it would be an emergency.\"\n \n Operator: \"But you aren't in any danger right now?\"\n \n Anti: \"Not that I know of.\"\n \n So, how can you call the cops BEFORE anything illegal happens? How do you know when it will happen? Do you know for a proven fact that someone won't show up 15 minutes from now and start shooting? What reason is there to dial 911, if nothing has happened? Don't you pretty much have to dial the phone AFTER it happens? 911 is for REPORTING emergencies, right?\n \n Yet:\n \n BRRRRING!\n \n Operator: \"911, What's your emergency?\"\n \n Anti: \"Yes, I've just been killed while walking down the street.\"\n \n Operator: \"You HAVE BEEN killed? As in past tense?\"\n \n Anti: \"Yup. I can't really call the cops BEFORE anything illegal happens, can I?\"\n \n Operator: \"No, I guess not.\"\n \n Anti: \"So it follows that I have to wait until AFTER something happens before I call 911, right?\"\n \n Operator: \"I guess.\"\n \n Anti: \"So, since this is a murder, I had to wait until AFTER I was killed. I would now like to have the police stop the guy who walked up, waved a gun, took my wallet, then shot me in the head. Do you think they can make it here BEFORE this happens?\"\n \n Niether of these scenarios make very much sense, do they? Yet, this is what folks are betting their lives on. Many antigunners here are in favor of REQUIRING you to choose between one of these scenarios.\n \n How is using a phone to call another human being to come running and risk their life BRINGING A GUN TO USE in order to save your life from something that is ALREADY happening is what anti-gunners put forth as the only responsible way to handle crime........\n \n ....yet taking responsibilty and receiving training to carry a preventative tool with you is not?\n \n Can't really answer this one with FACTS and answers based on REALITY.\n \n Probably gonna have to appeal to emotion on this one, huh?\n \n Big bad \"scary\" guns, and middle aged white males with inferiority complexes making up for small genitalia, and evil conservatives intimidating peace loving families and threatening to eat children while waving their scary guns everywhere!\n \n Betcha I won't get an answer to why humans with shiny metal disks arriving AFTER something happens is promoted as more responsible than simply doing it yourself BEFOREHAND.",

I asked this of everyone in general, but since you jumped on in and claimed it......answer up: HOW DO YOU READ THE FUTURE, OH WISE ONE? Maybe you fully intend on using this knowledge to call the cops just in time to prevent a violent assault. This must be why you have such confidence that no crime will ever happen wherever you happen to be.\n \n If this is so, I submit that you are the most callous and uncaring individual on the face of the earth. How could you possibly let those folks at Luby's cafeteria, NIU, or Virginia Tech get shot and killed when you have this gift of forshadowing danger in areas that everyone knows is safe. (Such as school campuses, and family restaurants) These places were gun free zones. Perfectly ordinary places where everyone is safe. Ask around.

To meet that criteria, even assuming 108,000 DGU'S at the bottom end, 5% of shot CCW carriers would be top news every night, they aren't! Most DGU'S happen in a public place and not at home which we debunked in Kellerman's so called studies.\n \n You have evidence that 20,000 per year of defensive use which is 5% get shot each year?

   "Objectives. We investigated the possible relationship between being shot in\n an assault and possession of a gun at the time.\n \n Methods. We enrolled 677 case participants that had been shot in an assault\n and 684 population-based control participants within Philadelphia from 2003 to\n 2006. We adjusted odds ratios for confounding variables.\n \n Results. After adjustment, individuals in possession of a gun were 4.46 (P<.05)\n times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not in possession. Among\n gun assaults where the victim had at least some chance to resist, this adjusted\n odds ratio increased to 5.45 (P<.05).\n \n Conclusions. On average, guns did not protect those who possessed them\n from being shot in an assault. Although successful defensive gun uses occur\n each year, the probability of success may be low for civilian gun users in urban\n areas. Such users should reconsider their possession of guns or, at least,\n understand that regular possession necessitates careful safety countermeasures.\n (Am J Public Health. 2009;99:XXX&#8211;XXX. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2008.143099)\n http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&context=dennis_culhane\n\n \n Men are 4 times more likely to be struck by lightning. Conclusion: Men conduct lightning better than women.\n \n Consider other possibilities and conclusions to your statistics, because it already has been proven that guns are widely used in self defense.

I move that the Convention go into committee of the whole, for the purpose of specific amendment, by inserting in the twenty-first section, after the word \"citizens,\" in the first line, the word \"openly,\" so as to read: \"The right of the citizens openly to bear arms in defence of themselves and the State, shall not be questioned.[\"] ...\n \n Mr. MacVeagh. For one, I shall vote against the proposition. I[n] the first place, I think the present Constitution is perfectly explicit and satisfactory on this subject; and in the second place, I have never been able to understand why a man might not be under the necessity of protecting himself by carrying a weapon of defence. \n \n Suppose an epidemic of garroting breaks out in the city of Philadelphia, as it did in the city of London a very few years ago; to tell me that I am to walk the streets of this city at night without any protection whatever from ruffians, is to state something to which I will never agree. Suppose I may be required, as I have been on different occasions, coming from the city of Washington upon a delayed train, to walk at half-past one or at two o'clock in the morning from the depot at Broad and Prime streets, and have my steps dogged all the way to the hotel, am I to have no possible protection? \n \n I understand that among other things that cannot be taken from a man, is the privilege he has to defend his life and to protect himself. Of course he is answerable to the fullest extent for the use of it, and your law against carrying concealed weapons does not interfere with the habit among the dangerous classes. But there are periods in every community, periods of excitement, when it may be necessary for a man to say in his own behalf, \"Say what your please and do what you please, but you must not beat or maltreat me,\" and with all the inequalities of physical condition that exist, it is the very worst thing in the world to say that if a man of my condition offends a man like Judge Woodward, he is to take a severe beating whenever his enemy chooses to inflict it. I do not believe in it. I believe in the right of self-defence of the weak against the strong, and I do not propose to allow any man to maltreat me at his pleasure, as long as there are any weapons of defence to be had by which I can equalize any strength with his....",

We offer the following questions which, of course, are never mentioned in the health advocacy literature on children and guns: If so sweeping a measure as confiscating 230 million firearms is justified because some 273 children under age fifteen die in firearm accidents annually, is the less intrusive measure of banning child bicycles justified by the death of three times as many children in bicycle accidents annually?[226] If confiscating over 80 million handguns is justified because approximately fifteen children under age five die in handgun accidents annually, is a ban on cigarette lighters justified by the fact that four times as many children in that age group die from playing with then annually?\n \n Consider the fact that over 400% more children under age fifteen die in drownings than in gun accidents;[227] twenty times as many children under age five drown in bathtubs and home swimming pools as are killed in handgun accidents.[228] Few people need a bathtub (as opposed to a shower stall) or a swimming pool. If the tragedy of accidental childhood gun fatalities justifies confiscating over 80 million handguns, or all of the more than 230 million firearms, do the much greater numbers of tragic childhood drownings justify a licensing system under which only the disabled and others who show they \"truly need\" a bathtub or swimming pool will be allowed to have them?[229]\n\n \n \n   Today's Gun Accident Rates Lowest On Record \n Among children, fatal firearm accidents have decreased 91 percent since 1975, according to studies by the National Center for Health Statistics and the National Safety Council.\n\n Safety is a never ending process.",

   "So you had no interest in preventing the same thing happening to someone else who might not have been armed? Bad citizen.emoticon_xkill\n\n I became disabled and had to retrain for a new career. I had no family that could help so I had to move into a Cleveland Housing projects while I went back to college. While there I saw massive drug dealing, which also drew prostitution, and gambling. I saw street or parking lot gambling, public intoxication and public urination, and an occasional dead body, all from the drug dealing. However, I figured that the drug dealers weren't bothering me so what did I care. After all, I was only going to be there for a very short time and it is a victimless crime right? \n \n Ah huh!\n \n Allow me to expel a few falsehoods. First of all, most every one of the drug dealers were NOT residence of the housing project, and neither were they the majority of their customers. Most all of the residents, although many were undereducated, were, in fact, good-hearted people who were, for the most part, good neighbors too.\n \n I was speaking to a neighbor, single mother of 2, and she was telling me that her children do not sleep on their beds at night. When I pressed her about this, she embarrassedly admitted that they sleep under their beds because of the almost nightly gunfire from the Drug dealers, and their patrons. Not residents. Most of the gun fire was from the drug dealers showing off, I am figuring, or testing out a gun being traded for crack. Any way, when I heard this, I lost my Natural mind. I thought to myself that in no way would I allow this to go on while I was on this Earth, while I could do something about it. I called the cops and was referred to the Housing police. They said they would do about as much as they can but their efforts were pretty ineffective. So I video taped all of the actors doing their crimes and took telephoto still pictures for positive identification and never told a sole that I was doing it because just before this, a church worker was murdered by the drug dealers because he inadvertently video taped a drug dealer while producing a video to try and spur donations. \n \n I mailed it to the Housing police and told my Senator, John Glenn about everything and his office got involved. They told the Housing authority, and the DEA, I think and contacted my Ohio State elected officials. There was an attempt to clean up the problem but it was not in any way what I thought the effort should be since the evidence I gathered had them dead to rights. They instead said they were going to concentrate their efforts on the Drug Buyers instead of the sellers. I thought, What? That isn't going to solve anything, but I waited to see the results. Noting! Absolutely Nothing, but a show.\n \n It was not long after the show that the son of a neighbor came over and told me that Moody, the head of the drug dealers was going to kill me, because he somehow found out about the video tapes and the photos. I talked to the Cleveland Police and was again referred to the housing police, so I went down to their off ice and talked to the Captain, who informed me that I was, indeed, in a heap of danger. I asked him what I could do and he told me that if I did not own a gun to buy one and carry it. He explained that (Before Ohio's CCW laws) there was a statute on the books called the prudent man defense. It seemed that the Ohio legislators in their wisdom, did not want to make any laws that violated common sense and put the law abiding in a trick bag for running afoul of a law that they could in no way obey. Hense, the Prudent Man Defense. \n \n To make a painfully long story short, this is where I was confronted by drug dealers, and I produced my pistol. After that all of the Drug Dealers left me alone, but was told that Moody was still planning to kill me. \n \n My friend from school knows a Cleveland Cop and told him about what was happening to me with a whole bunch of harassment and vandalism, and my friend was told by the cop, \" Let the Black uneducated people kill each other! My friend explained that I was white and a Veteran and that I did not deserve to be left totally unprotected the way I was, and the cop again said, \" I Said! Let the Negroes Kill each other.\" Which was extremely typical of my experience there.\n \n At any rate, Moody was shortly arrested and convicted of murdering someone else and the Drug Dealers moved down as far away from me as they could. Before I left, only two people were ever arrested. Moody and another drug dealer, but no arrest were ever made even after all of the evidence I presented.",
