   "Any student of demographics knows the answer to this question. Of course it is and guess where the replacement population will come from. I'll give you three guesses and the first two don't count.\n ===========================\n \n Is Europe Dying?\n Notes on a Crisis of Civilizational Morale\n By George Weigel\n Posted: Thursday, March 17, 2005\n EUROPEAN OUTLOOK\n AEI Online \n \n Europe's anemic birthrates are the most concrete manifestation of a spiritual crisis in the homeland of Western civilization. That crisis is driven by the marginalization of Christianity in European cultural, intellectual, and public life over the last century.\n \n America's \"Europe problem\" and Europe's \"America problem\" have been staple topics of transatlantic debate for the past several years. Political leaders, media commentators, and businessmen usually discuss those problems in terms of policy differences: differences over prosecuting the war on terrorism, differences over the role of the United Nations in world affairs, differences over the Kyoto Protocol on the global environment, differences over Iraq. The policy differences are real. Attempts to understand them in political, strategic, and economic terms alone will ultimately fail, however, because such explanations do not reach deeply enough into the human texture of contemporary Europe.\n \n To put the matter directly: Europe, and especially western Europe, is in the midst of a crisis of civilizational morale. The most dramatic manifestation of that crisis is not to be found in Europe's fondness for governmental bureaucracy or its devotion to fiscally shaky health care schemes and pension plans, in Europe's lagging economic productivity or in the appeasement mentality that some European leaders display toward Islamist terrorism. No, the most dramatic manifestation of Europe's crisis of civilizational morale is the brute fact that Europe is depopulating itself.\n \n Europe's below-replacement-level birthrates have created situations that would have been unimaginable when the institutions of European integration were formed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. By the middle of this century, if present fertility patterns continue, 60 percent of the Italian people will have no personal experience of a brother, a sister, an aunt, an uncle, or a cousin;[1] Germany will lose the equivalent of the population of the former East Germany; and Spain's population will decline by almost one-quarter. Europe is depopulating itself at a rate unseen since the Black Death of the fourteenth century.[2] And one result of that is a Europe that is increasingly \"senescent\" (as British historian Niall Ferguson has put it).[3]...\n \n (Snip)\n \n Boredom and Its Discontents\n \n The demographics are unmistakable: Europe is dying. The wasting disease that has beset this once greatest of civilizations is not physical, however. It is a disease in the realm of the human spirit. David Hart, another theological analyst of contemporary history, calls it the disease of \"metaphysical boredom\"--boredom with the mystery, passion, and adventure of life itself. Europe, in Hart's image, is boring itself to death.\n \n And in the process, it is allowing radicalized twenty-first century Muslims--who think of their forebears' military defeats at Poitiers in 732, Lepanto in 1571, and Vienna in 1683 (as well as their expulsion from Spain in 1492) as temporary reversals en route to Islam's final triumph in Europe-to imagine that the day of victory is not far off. Not because Europe will be conquered by an invading army marching under the Prophet's banners, but because Europe, having depopulated itself out of boredom and culturally disarmed itself in the process, will have handed the future over to those Islamic immigrants who will create what some scholars call \"Eurabia\"--the European continent as a cultural and political extension of the Arab-Islamic world. Should that happen, the irony would be unmistakable: the drama of atheistic humanism, emptying Europe of its soul, would have played itself out in the triumph of a thoroughly nonhumanistic theism. Europe's contemporary crisis of civilizational morale would reach its bitter conclusion when Notre-Dame becomes Hagia Sophia on the Seine--another great Christian church become an Islamic museum. At which point, we may be sure, the human rights proclaimed by those narrow secularists who insist that a culture's spiritual aspirations have nothing to do with its politics would be in the gravest danger...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.22139/pub_detail.asp",

Now for actual population decreases, I say good. In a world where robotics is going to take over much of the manual labor that people are doing now, what need is there for large surplus population. Fewer people, means fewer demands for resources, and a better environment. This could equal a better standard of living for future Europeans. Why compete with countries like India for cheap manual labor, causing many people to live in poverty when with a smaller population more people of that smaller population can lead better lives.",

   "I don`t really get it. How is depopulating itself \"a crisis of civilisational morale\"?\n \n And no, we are no \"depopulating ourself at an unseen rate since the black plague\". There was this little thing about colonizing america (or rather, deporting our christian fundies) in between. And that depopulatio was considered a a huge boost for european economy...\n \n The author is also trying to blame the declining birth rates on secularism and the decline of faith among europeans. Or as he puts it; \"disease of methaphysical boredom\". \n \n Now, sure, Europe is quite secularised and at first glance there is a paralell between a declining population in Europe and secularisation (as secualrisation as continued, birth rates have declined). Roughly as convincing as the paralell between internet access and declining populations (as internet acces has been more common, birth rates have declined). However, this does not mean that there is any causality or even correlation (as if you study the develpment in a larger time-frame, you will see no such correlation between secularisation and declining birth rates). \n \n But what the authors \"forgets\" is to look at country-specific figures. If you want to prove your pint that secularisation leads to depopulation (or at least declining birth rates) you should naturally compare individual countries (otherwise it`s mere speculation, or as in this case, simply fraudulent). If you take a look at the country specific birth-rates in europe  you will discover rather interesting things. I`ll summarize them in bullet points:\n \n * The lowest birth rates can be found in eastern and southern europe. These countries are the most chirstian countries in Europe. Spain and Italy are catholic, while most eastern european countries are orthodox. These countries occupy the \"lower half\" of the chart. \n \n * The traditionally most secularised countries can be found in northern Europe. These countries occupy the higher half of the chart; that is, these countries have high birthrates, compared to the sample at hand. \n \n * This all implies that secularisation either has no effect whatsoever on brth rates OR that there is indeed a positive relation between secularisation and birth rates.\n \n The author is obviously talking out his arse....\n \n And then he starts to rant about muslims... It`s funny how he talks about immigrants and refugees while never mentioning those who later return when the situation has stabilised in their home countries. He talks about immigrants to EU from Turkey while never even touching on the subject that in a not to distant future, these immigrants will no longer be immigrants as their home country (turkey) joins EU. In fact, quite a dubstantial portion of the cited muslim immigrants have european origin to begin with (Turkey, former Jugoslavia). He also forgets that historicly the numbers of muslims in european countries are quite low. During the age of imperialism, entire muslim countries where considered to be parts of european empires. Nowhere does he provide any figures for his assertion that:\n \n \"Europe's current demographic trendlines, coupled with\n the radicalization of Islam that seems to be a by-product\n of some Muslims' encounter with contemporary, secularized\n Europe, could eventually produce a twenty-second\n century, or even late twenty-first century, Europe\n increasingly influenced by, and perhaps even dominated\n by, militant Islamic populations, convinced that their\n long-delayed triumph in the European heartland is at\n hand.\"\n \n Sort of like you in another thread...\n \n It`s just another pointless rant. And islamo-phobic and decietful to boot.\n \n I also found this while browsing the subject:\n \n Population decline inevitable in the US? \n \n \"America has a fertility rate around the replacement level only because Hispanic immigrants maintain a high birth rate in the first generation after arrival. But with Latin American birth rates now falling fast, America's rate is almost certain to fall back below replacement level.\" \n \n I tried to find the facts and figures behind this, but couldn`t navigate the census beuro homepage...",

These countries occupy the higher half of the chart; that is, these countries have high birthrates, compared to the sample at hand. \n \n * This all implies that secularisation either has no effect whatsoever on brth rates OR that there is indeed a positive relation between secularisation and birth rates.\n \n The author is obviously talking out his arse....\n \n And then he starts to rant about muslims... It`s funny how he talks about immigrants and refugees while never mentioning those who later return when the situation has stabilised in their home countries. He talks about immigrants to EU from Turkey while never even touching on the subject that in a not to distant future, these immigrants will no longer be immigrants as their home country (turkey) joins EU. In fact, quite a dubstantial portion of the cited muslim immigrants have european origin to begin with (Turkey, former Jugoslavia). He also forgets that historicly the numbers of muslims in european countries are quite low. During the age of imperialism, entire muslim countries where considered to be parts of european empires. Nowhere does he provide any figures for his assertion that:\n \n \"Europe's current demographic trendlines, coupled with\n the radicalization of Islam that seems to be a by-product\n of some Muslims' encounter with contemporary, secularized\n Europe, could eventually produce a twenty-second\n century, or even late twenty-first century, Europe\n increasingly influenced by, and perhaps even dominated\n by, militant Islamic populations, convinced that their\n long-delayed triumph in the European heartland is at\n hand.\"\n \n Sort of like you in another thread...\n \n It`s just another pointless rant. And islamo-phobic and decietful to boot.\n \n I also found this while browsing the subject:\n \n Population decline inevitable in the US? \n \n \"America has a fertility rate around the replacement level only because Hispanic immigrants maintain a high birth rate in the first generation after arrival. But with Latin American birth rates now falling fast, America's rate is almost certain to fall back below replacement level.\" \n \n I tried to find the facts and figures behind this, but couldn`t navigate the census beuro homepage...\n\n \n The U.S. doesn't have a problem. We have about 293 million and growing. The Hispanic population is also not a problem as they are virtually 100% Christian who pose no real danger to our way of life. They are also hard working people and intensely loyal to America. Europe on the other hand is going into the toilet as witnessed by events almost daily. As I have said, Europe is like the frog in a slowly warming pan of water. You won't know you are dead until you are at boiling point and then it will be too late to do anything about your fate. You'll probably see it in your own lifetime.\n \n Just for the record, where I live the whites are about 55% of the population and about 20/25% for blacks and Hispanics. We get along quite nicely and are culturally similar. There are no budding terrorists living here. We're all pretty much in the same boat. To prove this point, Texas which is one of the most culturally diverse states in the union is almost entirely Republican now. That means that they support the president's policies and support other politicians of the same point of view. Liberals and Europeans are viewed as part of the problem; not part of the solution.",

   "A couple of flaws in your refutation.\n \n 1. Italy and Spain used to be Catholic, but that is no longer true. From talking with people from Spain, it's pretty secular. The Catholic Church is associated with Franco and Fascism and in both countries, there has been a huge movement against the Church.\n \n I'm not denying that there are \"rump\" communities that are still quite religious, but you cannot call Italy a Catholic country when p*rn stars become national political figures.\n\n \n Everything is relative. Spain and Italy are far less secularised than northern europe. That was my point. \n \n \n2. What is the ethnic breakdown of the northern European birth rates? The most popular name in the Netherlands for newborns is \"Mohammed.\" Northern Europe embraced Islamic immigrants early on (because they're so tolerant and all that) and it is possible that most of their population growth is based on these unassimilated immigrants.\n\n \n Considering that one of the two only countries with postitive childbirth/death ratio was Iceland (who`s only immigrant is that chess-playing american), I don`t think it`s a big issue. The only exeption where the size of the muslim minoritee might make an impact on child birth figures is perhaps France. Allthough that is still pure speculation.\n \n \nThe big problem Europe faces is how to sustain its welfare states with fewer active workers.\n\n \n That is a serious problem, yes. \n \n \nIf any of you can tell me how you can expect fewer children to pay the pensions of more parents, I'd like to hear it.\n\n \n Reduce the number and costs of pensions by increasing the retirment age... Utilize the surplus labour force that currently lies dormant due to unemployment.\n \n \nI'm curious about a couple of things, though.\n \n What actions are Europeans taking to deal with the declining birth rate, particularly when it comes to sustaining the welfare state?\n\n \n In Sweden, the birth rates are once again on the rise. Quite a few incentives to create more children has been offered by politicians (longer maternity leave, more resources to schools, housing subsidaries aimed at family households etc, etc.). \n \n \nIn the US, we're having a rather loud debate over Social Security and how it can last. Is a similar dialogue going on Over There?\n \n\n \n In sweden we had that debate in the 90-ies. We have allready settled as the SS will be phased out and individual but mandatory funds will replace the system. Actually, there was no real debate as all political parties agreed something had to be done.\n \n \nI'm not saying there is a conspiracy or anything, but merely that from past experience, European governments have a tendency to sweep unpleasantness under the rug.\n\n \n Unlike other governments? ;). Actually we have pretty strong laws in order to provide acountability and transperancy in Sweden. We are exporting these laws to the rest of Europe as we speak ;)\n \n \nCould \"white flight\" do to Europe what it did to America's inner cities?\n\n \n Probably not in Sweden. The \"inner cities\" are still considered the most attractive place to live, with house and apartment prices constantly on the rise. There are some problems with certain suburban areas though (and the notorious \"Roseng\u00e5rd\" in Malm\u00f6).\n \n \n \nI don't think anyone can argue with the notion that birth rates in Europe are differentiated: practicing Muslims don't use birth control and everything I've seen shows that they tend to have more children that their European hosts.\n\n \n What I`ve seen is that first generation immigrants (regardless of faith) tend to have more children. Second and third generation immigrants don`t produce any more children than average.\n \n \nSo you've got a situation where the immigrants are having more kids, more immigrants are arriving every day, and many of the native population - which is already in decline - are leaving.\n\n \n Where are they leaving? The largest immigrant and emmigrant groups are other europeans. More than 50% of swedish immigrants come from another nordic country... Figures are easily manipulated.\n \n \nThe U.S. doesn't have a problem. We have about 293 million and growing. The Hispanic population is also not a problem as they are virtually 100% Christian who pose no real danger to our way of life. They are also hard working people and intensely loyal to America. \n\n \n Did you even read the link? It was not about america becomming pre-dominatly hispanic, but that hispanic brith figures are what keeps the US on replenishment levels. And the hispanic birth figures are rapidly converging with the \"normal\" birth rates.\n \n \n Europe on the other hand is going into the toilet as witnessed by events almost daily. \n\n \n :p \n \n \nJust for the record, where I live the whites are about 55% of the population and about 20/25% for blacks and Hispanics.

America ought to be reserved for those who want the opportunity that we offer, or as JFK observed, \"ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.\"\n \n http://www.classbrain.com/artteenst/publish/printer_102.shtml \n \n I think that any American can criticize our policies but on the other hand if they cozy up to America's enemies then I believe it is logical to conclude that they are NOT patriotic and I would specifically cite Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore and Ramsey Clark.",

Funny that christian fundamentalists have reaped more lives than muslim fundamentalists over here (even if we only count the last few years)....

Given enough time, the crocodile will eventually get around to you as well. Then I can guarantee you that you will change your tune if history is any guide.\n \n \"The year 1940 marked a turning point for isolationists. German military triumphs in Europe and the Battle of Britain forced widespread American reconsideration of its relation to the war. Many worried that if Germany and Italy triumphed in Europe and Africa, and Japan triumphed in East Asia, the Western Hemisphere could be the next target. Even if America withstood assaults, its democracy, freedom, and economy could be traumatized in the \"fortress America\" it might have to maintain to guard its security. Given that frightening worst-case scenario, the majority, by the autumn of 1940, believed it important to ensure the defeat of the Axis even at the risk of war.\n \n But in 1940-1941 many still supported the noninterventionist America First Committee. Isolationists failed to block proposals by the Roosevelt administration to aid victims of Axis aggression with methods short of war. Nonetheless, 80 percent of Americans opposed any declaration of war against the Axis states. Not until after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and Germany and Italy declared war on the United States on December 11 did America turn to full-scale war against the Axis.\"\n \n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.answers.com/topic/isolationism",

   "Incidentally two different gangs of Christian fundamentalists have been fighting a war in the UK for the best part of 300 years. May I present to you:\n \n Ulster\n \n Many more lives have been lost through these guys killing each other and those around them than have been lost probably from all the suicide attacks commited by muslims in the last 50 years.\n\n \n You're comparing apples with oranges. Given enough time, the Mafia would kill as many people as died on 9/11. These religious wars as you described took place over a long period of time. 9/11 took more lives in one day than any other single terrorist attack in human history. Look it up. It's right in the history books.\n \n But beyond that, those religious wars in Ulster didn't present a worldwide challenge that Islamist fundamentalism poses. If you don't believe me, read what bin Laden and his ilk have to say. I can't recall that I have ever read or heard any pronouncement from either side in Ulster claiming that they wanted worldwide dominion as the Muslim fanatics have asserted. The truth is that the Islamist fanatics are the heirs of Nazism and the \"Cult of Death.\" That's what we are dealing with here. They clearly say that if we don't believe as they do, they will \"strike the heads\" meaning to saw our heads off as they have done so many times in Iraq. In fact it is sacred tenet of Islam dating back to its earliest founding. You can look that up as well. It's right in the history books.",

Let me emphasize that: Muslim clerics criticizing terrorism is headline news.\n \n Usually it's \"Death to America, Death to Israel, Death to the Infidel, Blessed are the Martyrs, etc.\"\n \n If they aren't actively advocating terrorism, then they're excusing it, finding reasons (usually something the Jews did) to justify blasting women and children (usually other Muslims) into little pieces in the name of Allah.\n \n I don't think that it has to be that way. I don't think that Islam requires a permanent state of war with the Unbelievers - but I'm also not a Muslim. It's not for me to say what is \"true\" Islam and what isn't.\n \n All I know is what I see, every day.\n \n Christians who call for holy wars find themselves isolated, ridiculed and often under police investigation. Muslims who do it are either state-sponsored, coddled by the government or excused on the grounds that they're only reacting to injustice.\n \n That being said, there has been a shift - perhaps because so many Muslims are being killed by other Muslims in the name of Allah. Iraq in particular is seeing a rejection of militant Islam and the Iranian people aren't all that interested in holy war.\n \n So I think things are moving in a positive direction, but we have a lot of ground to cover.",

I see that these days it is much said about Belarus' integration into european union which in particular finds expression in active support for Eastern Partnership program by new EU Council president Sweden. Privately, I'm deeply surprised with the plans to make Belarus enter the pan-European market. Even more, make Belarus' commodities dominate on the market of Eastern Europe as well as Central Europe!\n \n Actually, I've got to ask something to clear the situation. First of all, WHY does Sweden need it to be done and what's the sense for European Union? Secondly, is there really something so special that Belarus can produce and deliver to us? Don't we have all the same? Lastly, in case there is Belarus' integration into EU, what we gonna do with market glut? Then one more thing, why the hell should we have one more trouble in addition to Poland, Lithuania, Rumania and other new EU members? We already have got too many problems with them, alright? Why having more? All these make me think Sweden is acting illogically! Besides, I don't think that Lukashenko is worth dealing with.

And not only because it is beneficial to oil producing countries, but also because world economic recovery has begun and it becomes fruitful to such US and our British oil refining giants as Exxon-Mobil and British Petroleum to restore the high level of oil prices. There is no secret for anybody that, for instance, BP oil producing services are considered to be one of the best one in the world now. So BP is actively involved in the process of oil recovery all over the world. And up until that time it has surely sustained great losses in connection with world low prices. But its leadership had to accept this situation till some of its present senior executives hold high political office and aimed at recuperating affairs of our state in conditions of financial and economic crisis. Now Sir Mark Allen, former head of our counterterrorist department, has retired from MI6 and joined BP PLC.

All the money goes to Lukashenka who just gains extra resources to keep suppressing the opposition.

What will you do when all Jews leave Europe?\n\n \n Hi Zionist,\n You have no idea how many authoritative and objective articles i've read that speak to the mass infiltration into western Europe by moslems from every Islamic Nation on Earth. And other reports that speak to their increased reproductive rates over every other nationality on Earth. The heads of state in Europe see these statistics and know them to be true, but are either too afraid of radical islam to correct their immigration policies or are complicit in allowing islam to gain a statistical population majority within the predicted 25 years or so.\n \n But fear not because it has been prophesied that God will gather the children of Israel from around the world to return to their homeland, in these last days, just as is occurring today. God has also promised He will never break His covenant with Israel, nor will He ever leave or forsake you as a people. \n \n Peace to you and yours in this new year and I claim a hedge of Angels to be placed around you for protection as you continue on in your studies in the Netherlands. In Messiah's name I pray and claim this for you.\n Hsa 3:5 (NASB) - Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king; and they will come trembling to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days.\n \n And here:\n \n Hsa 5:15 I will go away and return to My place Until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me.\n \n \n Isa 27:12 In that day the LORD will start His threshing from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt, and you will be gathered up one by one, O sons of Israel.\n \n \n Isa 27:13 It will come about also in that day that a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were perishing in the land of Assyria and who were scattered in the land of Egypt will come and worship the LORD in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.\n \n \n Jer 3:22 \"Return, O faithless sons, I will heal your faithlessness.\" \"Behold, we come to You; For You are the LORD our God.",

Moreover, 40% of the cases are registered in London, with the number of cases rising by nearly 50% since 1999! I tell you more, the core reason of it is the great increase of immigration in the UK. See for yourself!\n According to current medical statistics the increase in the number of tuberculosis cases in London, for instance, has largely been in non-UK born groups. In 2009 these were black Africans (28%) and Indians (27%). But now 85% of white plague's cases are among Muslim immigrants! Till when should we be tolerant towards these dangerous people?

   "Wow! I've just come home from Latvia. What a country of chiaroscuros. Such dignified medieval sight seeing. I'm much impressed. But I was also impressed distastefully with local inhabitants. Honestly first I thought that I've somehow got to the amateur picture-taking of some movie about Fascists. In fact that occurred to be some meeting of local SS vets. Those old respectable people called out such Anti-Semite and Nazi slogans that I was in shock. But no one came and arrested them or even fined. They've got the right of free speech, you see. And news neo-Nazi guy Andris Jordans that denounced Jews and Roma as \"not being human\" right at meeting of the Latvian Anti-Fascist Committee surprised me much. First he was sentenced to an 18 month jail term for race hate speech. But now Latvian authorities are bowing and scraping in front of him. They are even going to pay him some compensation for unjust verdict. You see they couldn't prove that the speech of that hoodlum contained anything inciting race hatred. That's the real freedom for speech. Meanwhile I'm sure that some Jew or Roma would pay dearly for the similar speech about Latvians.\n And that's going on right here in Europe. And instead of expressing indignation Europeans are just arguing where the edge of freedom for speech should be. Imho that's a great shame for all of us. No one disturbs much about such open demonstrations of neo-Nazi convictions. Has something changed that I've missed?",
