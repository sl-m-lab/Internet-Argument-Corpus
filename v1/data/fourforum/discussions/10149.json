   "**\n \n Since I will no longer be contributing to any threads started by chemmy et al, except for 'en passant' mockery of particularly stupid comments made there by them, I've moved your post to its own thread, and so we'll see what happens. With luck you won't degenerate into the sort of hysterical personal vilification favoured by the likes of chemmy, slp, tq, et al.\n \n \n\n OK, here goes.\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n In a word, autopoiesis. See answers.com or wikiperdia.\n \n \"autopoiesis\n \n the process whereby an organization produces itself; literally, self-production (not to be confused with allopoiesis) \n \n \n So this is where your problem with the ex nihilo business lies I think? You say that life is autopoetic, ie self-producing, by definition. But given that nothing can just produce itself ex nihilo there must be a force driving said organisation, which you call vitality.\n \n And the problem with materialism is that it does not have an answer for what drives this organisation? \n\n \n **\n Actually, materialism does not have any answer for what 'drives' any organization, when you take the broad view. Meaning that their reliance on terms like 'law', 'force', 'energy' , etc., are only labels for unobserved non-corporeal, non-substantial, non-mateial, 'drivers', that are inferred from observations of certain repetitive, iterated 'change' phenomena/effects detected within this temporal, physical, substantial, corporeal universe. What these 'drivers' are, in and of themselves, is beyond materialism's power to explain, so it simply evades that fundamental question and starts with a universe, a reality, that 'just happened, that's all'. Ex nihilo. Ab nihilo.\n \n Given the measurable repetitions of some phenomena/effects within this universe, they then pretend that what they observe are the 'drivers' that cause what they observe, by labelling them, 'natural';-- by which they merely mean 'mechanical', by which they merely mean 'regularly repetitive', hence, predictable. \n In short, all of materialism/mechanism/physicalism/positivism/naturalism/darwinism/geneticism reduces to giving credit to effects for being their own causes. Which earns a great big, \"DUH!!\", from me.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n In the materialist/mechanit/positivist world all systems, including biosystems, are allopoietic, i.e., passive, externally operated and controlled. That is a \"system\", a productive organization of interelated parts, generating a process which produces something other than itself and its own constituent parts.\n \n Simple chemical systems are always allopoietic, and darwinists view all systems as simple chemical systems. \n \n \n This doesn't make sense to me. It looks like a straw man. The reason being, that once you have any physical system larger than a single particle/quantum, that physical system's internal state is no longer solely determined by external forces. It quite obviously is also determined by events internal to the system, which, if you could trace the evolution of a system back in time with perfect accuracy, would all be originally determined by the system's initial state. \n\n \n **\n Not so. Systems are extended, temporally. They are a series of connected, interdependent events, and not a singlular event, by definition. Therefore there is no saying that what determines them is a single set of 'initial conditions', since even the simplest allopatric systems [such as the solar system], are constantly and perpetually receiving fresh input on top of whatever their 'initial conditions' may have been. Initial conditions start systems going, but they continue on thanks to constant input; otherwise entropy puts a stop to them. Therefore it is false to believe that \" if you could trace the evolution of [any] system back in time with perfect accuracy, [then what it is now] would all be originally determined by the system's initial state.\".\n \n If we look at a closed system, as materialists suppose our universe to be, and look strictly at the material, physical events occurring within it, and assume that it is receiving no further 'physical' inputs than were the 'initial conditions' of the 'Big Bang', then it becomes plausible to believe, as materialist/mechanists most adamantly insist, that every single change event that occurred, is occurring, or ever will occur, was predestined, immutable, and inevitable, no matter whether it was anomalous or was systematic, right down to the last typo I've made so far in this post. All thanks to what they label as 'inititial conditions'. In the case of 'the big bang' they've another word for that, too, --something that call a 'singularity'. One more cute bumper-sticker that has no real meaning behind it at all.\n \n Seen from that angle, everything that occurs in any 'system' is simply a continuation of the action of the 'drivers' involved in the 'initial conditions', no matter how protracted that action may be. The 'initial conditions' of 'the break' in a game of billiards determining exactly where each ball will end up, no matter how many ricochets it makes off rails and other balls. And so on for each shot throughout the systematized process that is the game entire. \n And that is very much the view of the universe's internal systems as held by materialists today. The closed system that is the universe seen as a variation on a pool shot, i.e., \"assumed\" , 'taken for granted', initial conditions determining various dissipatory extentions in subsequents events, until 'the table' is all used up, entropically. All 'systems', be they physical or biological, as allopoietic strings of predestined and mechanically inevitable entropic outcomes.\n \n That mentality is utterly satisfactory until it slams into a brick wall called biology. All of a sudden we have autopoietic systems where phenomena are observed that cannot be justified or rationalised in terms of 'initial conditions', nor in terms of additional external physical inputs,and allopoietic controls, but only in terms of initial and continuing psychical inputs. This does not stop true-believing materialists from trying to rationalise these psychical biological phenomena back into their mechanical mindset, however. We hear new magic words from them intead. Words like, 'epiphenomena' and 'emergence'. More euphemisms for 'spontaneous generation', aka, 'creatio ex nihilo, ab nihilo'. Aka, 'magick'. Materialism, and the darwinism it spawned, is an extremely superstitious mindset.\n \n \n\n I cannot see how any form of materialism could possibly maintain that all, or even any, physical systems, are entirely \"passive, externally operated and controlled\". \n\n \n **\n Well, that is what they do, darwinists included. Why else do they cling to their \"RM+NS\", [which is exactly that, no more, no less], do you suppose?\n \n \n\n To take such a viewpoint is to ignore the (vast in the case of biosystems) complexity of forces unleashed by the continuous, evolving patterns of internal system-state changes, the first change being determined by a disequilibrium of forces, which is itself determined by the initial state.\n\n \n **\n Nice words, but the \"complexity of forces unleashed by the continuous, evolving patterns of internal system-state changes\" is nothing more than billiard balls bouncing around, unless and until you can invest them with an additional dynamic which is distinct and apart from the 'initial conditions' of the cue/ball interaction. Which is pretty much something you cannot do in billiards, but can do in biology. Do you remember the croquet match in ' Alice'\n where the balls, being little rolled up rodents, just didn't behave like billiard ballks, or croquet balls, or any balls, must do in a strictly allopoietic physical system? I seem to remember that the croquet mallets, being live flamingoes, also added an internal dynamic to an otherwise materialist, allopoietic system/game.\n \n \n\n The only thing imaginable that would not be affected by this process, is something which has a perfect internal equilibrium of forces.\n\n \n **\n You are still trying on the materialist rationale of portraying effects as their own causes, whether you realize this or not. \"Perfect internal equilibrium of forces\" is just the entropy that comes to every closed system, after the protracted interactions driven by the closed system's 'initial conditions' have dissipated. \n In a closed system 'initial conditions' account for everything that transpires until everything stops and you no longer have a 'system', at all. For example, a single shot in a pool game. \n In systems that are extended and maintained, such as a pool game entire, external input must be continually added to them as open systems. If that input/driver is externally generated, exogenous, and purely physical, [i.e., can be reduced to the four physical forces], as in a game of pool, or normal croquet, then the system is allopoietic, and passive. BUT, if, as is the case in biosystems, (and Alice's croquet match), that input is non-corporeal, non-substantial, but psychical, a 'driver'/force harnessed by the internal components of the game, that is the system itself, (say flamingoes and rolled up rodents, or whatever they were) and is used to its own purposes and ends, and not the purposes and ends of the external 'players', then that system/game is autopoietic, and dynamic.\n \n Time for a break. Later.",

Little is known about how these variations (noise) in natural systems affects such transitions. In Bacillus subtilis, noise in ComK, the protein that regulates competence for DNA uptake, is thought to cause cells to transition to the competent state in which genes encoding DNA uptake proteins are expressed. We demonstrate that noise in comK expression selects cells for competence and that experimental reduction of this noise decreases the number of competent cells. We also show that transitions are limited temporally by a reduction in comK transcription. These results show how such stochastic transitions are regulated in a natural system and suggest that noise characteristics are subject to evolutionary forces.\n",

   "Actually, materialism does not have any answer for what 'drives' any organization, when you take the broad view. Meaning that their reliance on terms like 'law', 'force', 'energy' , etc., are only labels for unobserved non-corporeal, non-substantial, non-mateial, 'drivers', that are inferred from observations of certain repetitive, iterated 'change' phenomena/effects detected within this temporal, physical, substantial, corporeal universe. What these 'drivers' are, in and of themselves, is beyond materialism's power to explain, so it simply evades that fundamental question and starts with a universe, a reality, that 'just happened, that's all'. Ex nihilo. Ab nihilo.\n\n \n But it does have an answer, as long as (and I see no reason to infer otherwise) 'organisation' is defined, as are many scientific concepts, as a human-imposed description of the sum of a multitude of physical cause/effect phenomena. Remember when we argued about entropy? I essentially stated (or admitted, if you want to see it that way) that the concepts that we label 'entropy', 'order', 'disorder' and even 'particle' are human-imposed abstracts applied for ease of understanding. \n \n Again referencing a point I have previously made, the maths that backs up the areas of physics (which necessarily includes chemistry/biology) that are confirmed with near-certitude, is equally as-certain-as-possible, but is impossible to satisfactorily translate into ordinary language; hence the terms employed that, relative to the maths, are so vague and easily misinterpretable. My best example is the uncertainty principle, which can be explained in words, but can only be shown to be an uncontrevertible fact by using maths. The great thing about the UP is that it is not even necessary to perform a real experiment; given certain parameters (already known) the UP is inevitable.\n \n The POV I am justifying here is one that does not even begin to reference such terms as 'organisation' and what may 'drive' it. This may be a personal thing, but ideally IMHO the scientific method should never assume 'organisation' or 'drives', it should only look at facts and figures. After this analysis has been done mathematically, there may (and indeed always are) patterns discernible that we, humans, can label 'organisation' and 'drives', but these things do not exist in and of themselves. They are abstracts, simplifications, words used so that we do not have to talk in complex equations.\n \n Given all this, when we come to the Four Fundamental Forces, we do actually know (ie we are almost certain) that these phenomena are a part of the world of facts and figures, not part of the world of human-imposed concepts. My best supporting argument for this is that the FFFs cannot (yet) be further reduced to anything simpler. There are plenty of other 'forces' such as kinetic energy, potential energy etc that derive their very existence from the FFFs. The FFFs are anything but non-material, as they are intermediated by known, defined, observed particles/quanta or in the case of gravity, the medium of spacetime. The only confusion comes when trying to determine \"What is a particle? What is spacetime?\" Regardless of the answers, surely we have to assume that particles and spacetime are material, for if not, then nothing is.\n \n \nGiven the measurable repetitions of some phenomena/effects within this universe, they then pretend that what they observe are the 'drivers' that cause what they observe, by labelling them, 'natural';-- by which they merely mean 'mechanical', by which they merely mean 'regularly repetitive', hence, predictable. \n In short, all of materialism/mechanism/physicalism/positivism/naturalism/darwinism/geneticism reduces to giving credit to effects for being their own causes. Which earns a great big, \"DUH!!\", from me.\n\n \n I absolutely, genuinely fail to see how you come to this conclusion. If we take the FFFs as the ultimate causatory agents, I see two problems for your above conclusion:\n \n 1) Given a simple multi-body system in a vacuum, the only non-negligible force at work will be gravity. Any one fully descriptive 'snapshot' of that system must include the gravitational forces at work at that instant. The 'snapshot' state will have been caused to be by the preceeding gravitational interactions, and will go on to cause future states based on the gravitaional (dis)equilibrium of the 'snapshot' state. This is where I find myself thinking that we are purely arguing semantics; the idea that an effect can be its own cause is indeed logically unsound, but given any real-world example, the reality is not as simple as this, to be honest, trite metaphor. In my example, the chain of cause-and-effect goes [physical configuration 1] --< [resultant gravitational effects 1] --< [physical configuration 2] --< [resultant gravitational effects 2] ad infinitum. And the same is true of all such causal chains.\n \n 2) The only problem comes at the end of the causal chain, ie the beginning, the Big Bang, the cosmic singularity, whatever. But as I have said before, and as has recently started to enter popular science journals, the idea is certainly not that the universe 'just happened' or was 'caused by its own effects'. It has long been assumed that there must have been a prior cause; hence theories of cyclical universes or higher-dimensinal spaces. Why such crazy theories that work only in maths and not in practice? Because physicists (materialists almost to a man) have recognised for decades that the philosophical problems you accuse materialism of ignoring are very real and unavoidable. Ex nihilo, nihil fit. To a physicicst, this is obvious and unquestioned.\n \n \nNot so. Systems are extended, temporally. They are a series of connected, interdependent events, and not a singlular event, by definition. Therefore there is no saying that what determines them is a single set of 'initial conditions', since even the simplest allopatric systems [such as the solar system], are constantly and perpetually receiving fresh input on top of whatever their 'initial conditions' may have been. Initial conditions start systems going, but they continue on thanks to constant input; otherwise entropy puts a stop to them. Therefore it is false to believe that \" if you could trace the evolution of [any] system back in time with perfect accuracy, [then what it is now] would all be originally determined by the system's initial state.\".\n\n \n But of course! Of course you have to take into account all the input that any one system receives from all external sources in order to trace back to an initial state. \n \n (No system can ever be truly closed, truly isolated from the rest of the universe, for what should be obvious reasons. Certain systems are only classified as 'closed' for experiments' sake because they have been very efficiently isolated and the parameters of unavoidable input are precisely calculable and can be subtracted from results, thereby giving the results that a truly closed system would provide.) In your pool-shot example below, for instance, the initial state must take account of the wear & tear of the table, the strength of the cue, the slope of the floor, humidity, temperature and every other variable.\n \n So any such 'backtracking' (which is highly hypothetical given the extreme complexity of the calculations) has to take into account the knowledge that no system is isolated. This is part of what chaos theory attempts to do, and why chaos theory must deal in probabilities until we have computers ordres of magnitude more powerful than we do today.\n \n \nIf we look at a closed system, as materialists suppose our universe to be, and look strictly at the material, physical events occurring within it, and assume that it is receiving no further 'physical' inputs than were the 'initial conditions' of the 'Big Bang', then it becomes plausible to believe, as materialist/mechanists most adamantly insist, that every single change event that occurred, is occurring, or ever will occur, was predestined, immutable, and inevitable, no matter whether it was anomalous or was systematic, right down to the last typo I've made so far in this post. All thanks to what they label as 'inititial conditions'. In the case of 'the big bang' they've another word for that, too, --something that call a 'singularity'. One more cute bumper-sticker that has no real meaning behind it at all.\n \n Seen from that angle, everything that occurs in any 'system' is simply a continuation of the action of the 'drivers' involved in the 'initial conditions', no matter how protracted that action may be. The 'initial conditions' of 'the break' in a game of billiards determining exactly where each ball will end up, no matter how many ricochets it makes off rails and other balls. And so on for each shot throughout the systematized process that is the game entire. \n And that is very much the view of the universe's internal systems as held by materialists today. The closed system that is the universe seen as a variation on a pool shot, i.e., \"assumed\" , 'taken for granted', initial conditions determining various dissipatory extentions in subsequents events, until 'the table' is all used up, entropically. All 'systems', be they physical or biological, as allopoietic strings of predestined and mechanically inevitable entropic outcomes.\n \n That mentality is utterly satisfactory until it slams into a brick wall called biology. All of a sudden we have autopoietic systems where phenomena are observed that cannot be justified or rationalised in terms of 'initial conditions', nor in terms of additional external physical inputs,and allopoietic controls, but only in terms of initial and continuing psychical inputs. This does not stop true-believing materialists from trying to rationalise these psychical biological phenomena back into their mechanical mindset, however. We hear new magic words from them intead. Words like, 'epiphenomena' and 'emergence'. More euphemisms for 'spontaneous generation', aka, 'creatio ex nihilo, ab nihilo'. Aka, 'magick'. Materialism, and the darwinism it spawned, is an extremely superstitious mindset.\n\n \n But here I slam into my own brick wall, one which neatly intersects my path down your chain of reasoning. Biological systems are simply orders of magnitude more complex than any other chemical processes because they are , by definition, autocatalytic-with-errors systems, which is a giant leap in terms of potential, in terms of the variety of future system-states that can be generated. But it is still possible to model these system-state trajectories in terms of probability, which is where chaos theory and emergence come in.\n \n To bring myself to a close, I return to my original point. The concept 'emergence' is a human-imposed concept that can be easily described, if you so wish, as new information arising in a system ex nihilo. But it is equally easily (and more precisely) described as a rearrangent of a system's information in a way that is specifically unpredictable. That is what emergence is. There is no 'energy' created ex nihilo. There is no 'matter' created ex nihilo. The only thing that seems to be created ex nihilo is that sudden realisation within the human mind that the patterns of information have drastically changed in a way that redefines the entire system. This is why maths is essential, because the maths shows that the system has merely been reorganised, albeit radically.\n \n It is such radical restructuring of information that I suspect gives rise to apparent consciousness. As I have said before, I do not deny consciousness, and I do prefer to think that it is real. But I do not assume that it is anything but apparent when I am making analytical judgements, and I cannot begin to imagine how you come to the conclusion that organisms such as bacteria possess it when they specifically, are quite obviously and evidently, no more than fiendishly complex micromachinery. With mammals it's another story.",

   "OK, I'm not going to go point-by-point again because from prior experience I find that tends to make debates expand in scope until they become too unwieldy to manage. Rather I will try to clarify my ideas in a few concise paragraphs. Hope this is ok.\n \n Regarding what is and what is not 'material' vs 'human-imposed concepts': \n \n Essentially what I don't understand about your point of view is that the things you often mention as being more important than 'bits of stuff' are concepts such as organisation, meaning, significance etc. My problem is that these seem to be far vaguer terms than even the most nebulous of physical concepts, and I don't see how they could be quantified in any useful way that would lead to a productive analysis. \n \n The reason I keep banging on about things like the FFFs is that there are a limited quantity of material things which make up reality. Essentially these would be the mass-energy quanta, and the fabric of spacetime.* These all interact with each other obviously, but that does not make me see these interactions as things in and of themselves. They are just 'results', where quanta and spacetime are the 'method', if such an analogy makes sense.\n \n I still do not really get where you are coming from on this issue. Where is your ideal starting point for understanding reality, as opposed to materialist reductionism? \n \n *Data this year (I think, I can find the link if you want) have shown that the speed of artificial satellites is affected by the physical twisting of space around the earth as the planet and its gravitational field revolve. This suggests to me that spacetime is in fact a physical thing in and of itself and not just the immaterial framework in which everything else sits.\n \n Regarding maths:\n \n Maths is not just a 'useful tool' as opposed to a language. It is a language which is stripped of all superfluous psychological baggage, of dualities of meaning, in order to precisely model reality. It seems an obvious truism that neither you nor I can ever describe physical systems using ordinary language with anything like the precision of mathematics, a precision which is the only factor that gives us any progress in understanding.\n \n If you believe that you can use ordinary language as satisfactorily as maths to describe anything, how would you use words (as opposed to calculus) to describe the gravitational field of a non-spherical body? I do not believe this is possible.\n \n Regarding cause/effect, matter and force:\n \n Modern physics does not assert that matter generates force a la materialism, or that force generates matter a la dynamism. Rather, experiments in quantum physics and especially in high-energy physics have suggested with a great deal of certainty that words like 'matter', 'energy' and 'force' are indeed just human-imposed concepts on an underlying reality in which all these things are just different aspects of the same phenomenon; mass-energy, or mass-energy-force, or whatever you want to call it.\n \n As to effects being their own causes, I again don't get where you're coming from. The initial configuration of any given physical system determines its evolution. This is obvious. The only problem I can see with this is the equally obvious fact that logically we have to extrapolate this idea backwards all the way to the Big Bang, whose cause is entirely unknown to us. \n \n When I called the FFFs the 'ultimate causatory agents' I may have not used quite the language I intended; I did not mean to say that they are the 'first cause', I just meant that without them the rest of the mass-energy would just hang in space, and we would never have had stars and all the rest of it.\n \n So where in all this do you see anyone claiming (knowingly or not) that any effect is its own cause?\n \n To reply to your last post, I will return to quoting you.\n \n \nSounds like solipcism to me. The notion that the mind is the only reality, so that, simply by changing our minds, we can change reality.\n\n \n That is obviously almost the very opposite of what I am saying. My point is that the actual reality of what happens in an emergent system is that (to repeat myself) the mass-energy of that system is reorganised in a way which is specifically unpredictable. That is all. What goes on in our minds (the assigning of meaning and significance, the imposition of the concept of 'information') has absolutely no bearing on reality at all. There is no real quality of that system that has been increased/improved ex nihilo, there is only a conceptual quality, and a subjective one at that, which humans term 'information'. \n \n \nEither that or the equally absurd notion that all information is hallucinagenic, illusory, and utterly unreliable.\n\n \n As far as I see it, the 'information' is just what our brains tell us about the real mass-energy configuration of the system. \n \n \n \n What is difficult is to explain how a system whose parts, neither singly nor in sum, can generate something _productively_novel that was not there before in that entire system. All ordinary systems generate their own destruction--it's called entropy. The only complex sytems the generate productive novelty never do this on their own, ex nihilo. They only do it when intelligence and volition are input. Machines and artefacts have human, sometimes animal, intelligence and volition input into them, exogenously. Living organisms have access to vitality, that is, the vitality they were 'born with', acting within them, operating endogenously, generating the intelligence and volition they need in order to generate productive novelty; that is, to adapt and to evolve.\n\n \n What do you mean by something which is 'productive'? This seems to be another subjective, unquantifiable term. \n \n Essentially I definitely need answers to the following or I will not be able to respond further:\n \n How do you define 'information' as it relates to complex systems and entropy?\n \n How do you distinguish between what is 'productive' and what is not?\n \n I expect that the answers are interrelated?\n \n Well that was much longer than I intended it to be! I'll leave the last bit about consciousness for now, other than to say I should have put a smiley or something after the bit about mammals, that wasn't really serious!",

There are material \"things\", i.e., objects, 'bits of stuff', and then there are abstract \"things\", some of them physical, such as forces, numbers, and so on, and some of them psychical, such as 'meaning, significance'. Materialists try to pretend that they can reify, concretize, an abstraction of the physical kind and so make it consonant with their corporeal foundation to reality, (which is in ans of itself fallacious and irrational) while at the same time simply hand-waving away abstract \"things\" of the psychical kind as either, 'non-existent', 'epiphenomenal', or even 'supernatural'. Much as they would like to do that, and do do it all the time, over and over again, doing it is an irrational act.\n \n \n\n The reason I keep banging on about things like the FFFs is that there are a limited quantity of material things which make up reality.

Earlier you said, \"My problem is that these seem to be far vaguer terms than even the most nebulous of physical concepts,\", but I cannot imagine anything more nebulous than this. \n \n \n\n but that does not make me see these interactions as things in and of themselves.

Where is your ideal starting point for understanding reality, as opposed to materialist reductionism? \n\n \n **\n at risk of sounding facetious, my ideal starting point for understanding the reality that is the universe of which we are a part, is at the beginning--at the original cause of its genesis. Materialists reduce reality to 'bits of stuff', but \"The Big Bang\" changed particles from being the cause of reality into being no more than a part of it, one more effect, and not the ultimate 'cause' of anything. Rather, corporeal matter became nothing more, over this past century, than an effect, and a transmitter by which causation is transmitted from a non-corporeal, immaterial source. Analogous to how a copper wire,\n 'transmits', the causation of electro-magnetism, but is not the source, the orgin, the cause, of it. Or how a cue ball transmits the causation that starts with the player along to other balls that strike other balls, and so on on, but which never 'originated' any causality of their own. As materialists believe that such bits of stuff can, and do, actually do.\n \n IOW, I'm firmly \"ex nihilo, ab nihilo, nihil fit\".\n \n Break time.",

Obviously 'spacetime', whatever you mean by that term, is not corporeal, concrete, substantial, palpable, and material--is it?\n \n That is, something that may only be considered 'tangible' by mental inference, not direct observation. Not a matter of substance, but of procedure or method. \n \n IAC, interpretation of observation is a psychical thing, whether you do it verbally or mathematically, and your opinion is, like all opinions, just that. IOW, I have absolutely no reason to think of 'spacetime' as any more 'physical' than 'gravity' or 'vitality'. That is, as a mental abstraction, like 'meaning' and 'organization', and on and on.\n \n \n\n Regarding maths:\n \n Maths is not just a 'useful tool' as opposed to a language.\n\n \n **\n \"Maths\" is no more no less a \"useful tool\" than verbalism is. Both are languages by which the world is symbolically represented for purposes of mental communication/contact. They are different approaches to, and different tools for, the exact same purpose, and are in no way \"opposed\" to one another.\n \n \n\n It is a language which is stripped of all superfluous psychological baggage,\n\n \n **\n That's what you think. A numeral has no \"psychological baggage\", but then neither does a letter. But once you start putting them together, whether into equations or into paragraphs, and so invest them with _meaning_, then the 'psychological baggage' comes out swinging. It is inescapable. Don't believe me? Just check out certain debates between theoretical physicists, \n mathematicians, and the like.\n \n \n\n of dualities of meaning, in order to precisely model reality.\n\n \n **\n Useful, to be sure, and often necessary, but since 'reality' tends to be equivocal, eliminating that natural equivocation artificially by reducing it to a certain symbolic representation, i.e., maths, cuts out a lot of the truth of it. That's why we still have art and poetry, music and so on, and refuse, [unless we are B.F.

And since I am not so much interested in describing and measuring the details of of reality as I am in understanding their whys and wherefores, words still do that for me far better than abstruse mathematical abstractions.\n \n \n\n If you believe that you can use ordinary language as satisfactorily as maths to describe anything, how would you use words (as opposed to calculus) to describe the gravitational field of a non-spherical body?

That has been my basic metaphysical postulate for many years. But learning, knowing, and understanding, (for human beings, at least), depends upon differentiation, discrimination, and identification. Viewing reality as one amorphous whole in which one aspect cannot be distinguished from another is as useless as painting a watercolour blindfolded and wearing boxing gloves.\n \n In physics, the \"aspects\" of reality are not just 'labels'. They are meaningful divisions in our understanding, and the words chosen to represent those meanings are just as meaningful as the actual phenomena that they symbolize. 'Cause' and 'effect' have to count for something.\n \n \n\n As to effects being their own causes, I again don't get where you're coming from. \n\n \n **\n Well, I am sorry that you are having difficulty, but what do you expect me to do about it?

At least, you never respond in any direct and specific manner to anything I say in response to any specific objection you raise. And BTW, statements such as yours, above, are not the least bit specific, and taken as is, without clarification and specification, I can make no real response to them other than, \"Well, gee, that's too bad.\".\n \n \n\n The initial configuration of any given physical system determines its evolution. This is obvious.\n\n \n **\n Well, no, it is not \"obvious\". What is obvious is that \"The initial configuration of any given physical system [PARTLY] determines its evolution.\"\n \n \n\n The only problem I can see with this is the equally obvious fact that logically we have to extrapolate this idea backwards all the way to the Big Bang, whose cause is entirely unknown to us.\n\n \n **\n Why is that? This would only be necessary if you assume the materialist/mechanist postulate of mechanical/physical determinism that the universe is itself a closed system wherein your assertion that \"The initial configuration [Big Bang] of any given physical system,[i.e., universe] [TOTALLY] determines its evolution.\", is true. But that would only be true if a closed system could have had a beginning that did not originate from outside of itself, that is, could originate, 'ex nihilo, ab nihilo', in a magical act of spontaneous generation.\n \n \n\n When I called the FFFs the 'ultimate causatory agents' I may have not used quite the language I intended; I did not mean to say that they are the 'first cause', I just meant that without them the rest of the mass-energy would just hang in space, and we would never have had stars and all the rest of it.\n\n \n **\n I quite agree. And that is the dynamist cosmological assumption, apart from the part where there would be no \"mass-energy\", to 'hang about', nor any 'space for them to 'hang about' in, since without them there would be no universe at all. But this is the antithesis of the materialist/mechanist position, i.e., that if we did not have \"stars and all the rest of it\", we would not have the \"4FF's\".\n \n \n\n So where in all this do you see anyone claiming (knowingly or not) that any effect is its own cause?\n\n \n **\n Where in all of what?!?

Honestly, WW, dark matter is not a can of worms. It is a strange beastie, but it not something that is chucking spanners anywhere near the works.\n \n * Spacetime. What is it? Well, as we all know, mass can be converted to energy, and energy has mass. So when we take a perfect vacuum (which by definition is nothing but spacetime), what do we find? We find that this utterly empty space has a ground-state energy which we observe 'manifesting' as particle/antiparticle production/annihilation. If we extrapolate this to an extreme, there will be a limit on how much (p/a p/a) any given unit of spacetime can produce. This has not been determined experimentally or, as far as I know, theoretically, but according to the 1LoT it must be limited. Therefore any given unit of empty spacetime will have a maximum amount of associated potential energy, which will give us the mass of that unit of spacetime. This mass can be directly observed as seemingly 'spontaneously' created particles. These particles appear to undergo state changes from [spacetime] to [energy] to [mass] and back again. Hence spacetime is material.\n \n *What is known as 'spontaneous emmission' is a great way to envisage mass-energy symmetry. When a particle emits a photon it can literally be described as having converted some of itself into a photon, and as a result drops to a lower 'energy state' which effects its interactions with other particles in a very real and very mechanical sense. Another excellent example of mechanical operations at the fundamental level is that of the strong force and the relationship of quarks and gluons, but I'll leave that for now.\n \n Like I said, I won't give a deadline but the above topics are at least vaguely relevant to what I will say, and they were mentioned in my now-lost response. I have, so far, refrained from responding until you have finished quoting me, even when it has often taken you 3 or 4 posts to respond to one of mine. I hope you will extend to me the same courtesy.",

Sigh!\n \n \n\n Unfortunately my bastard computer seems to have some form of digital alzheimer's and I fear it is not long for this world. \n\n \n **\n I, too, am lumbered with incredibly ancient hardware that plays havoc with my work on a whim, but I never seem to get around to junking it, not so long as it still works, some of the time. Were I a younger person, it would have hit the trash heap years ago.\n \n \n\n I can quickly make three points regarding physics:\n\n \n **\n Actually, I'm not that interested in physics, except where, like biology, it impinges on philosophy. In this case, cosmology. So I may not have much to say about it. \n \n \n\n * There are multiple hypotheses as to the nature of dark matter, but the ones that make the most sense (ie are consilient with other areas of particle physics) show that it is made of familiar particular constituents.\n\n \n **\n You must be using a brand new definition of 'particle'. Here is the definition [the old, standard definition] that I use, from wiki via answers.com--\n \n \"Wikipedia particle (disambiguation) \n Besides its common definition, particle may refer to:\n \n \n In chemistry:\n \n Molecule \n Atom \n neutron \n Photon \n Colloidal particle in colloid chemistry, a one-phase system of two or more components\"\n [interject, ww--these all are corporeal bits of 'matter', therefore, not 'anti-matter'.]\n \n \"In physics:\n \n Subatomic particle, which may be either: \n Elementary particle, a particle of which larger particles are composed, also called a fundamental particle \n Composite particle, a bound state between several elementary particles \n Point particle, an idealized particle that does not have any volume\"[bold mine]\n \n [interject, ww--that is to say, a 'metaphysical' particle, a pure abstract notion, and one that is non-material/not matter, by reason of not possessing matter's essential quality, i.e., the quality of 'extension'. Using the word 'particle' in this instance is to commit the grievous fallacy of 'concretizing the abstract' [see Alfred North Whitehead], and is common among materialists who play Humpty Dumpty with semantics in order to deal with reality on their own peculiar terms.]\n \n \n\n Honestly, WW, dark matter is not a can of worms. It is a strange beastie, but it not something that is chucking spanners anywhere near the works.\n\n \n **\n Please. It's destroyiong materialism even as we speak. Just try to reconcile the materialist/mechanist/determinist/positivist/physicalist/naturalist, etc., metaphysical ontology with 'antimatter'. It cannot be done. Right off the bat, you cannot claim that \"A\"[matter] is the fundamental substrate of all reality [materialism, etc.], and at the the same time admit of the existence of \"Not-A\"[antimatter] as part of that reality.\n You can only recognise antimatter, if you are a materialist, (or one its clones), by proposing a second 'reality', one whose fundamental substrate is 'antimatter'. The admission of this 'dualist' understanding of 'reality' undermines and destroys everything materialism, [an essentially 'monist' ontological position], and the related monist metaphysical positions founded upon it [including darwinism], seek to assert about reality.\n \n \n\n * Spacetime. What is it? Well, as we all know, mass can be converted to energy, and energy has mass.\n\n \n **\n Say what?!?! Since when does energy have mass? That's a new one on me, especilly as the one is supposedly convertible with the other. That is, you get mass or you get energy--take your pick.\n \n \n \n\n So when we take a perfect vacuum (which by definition is nothing but spacetime), what do we find? We find that this utterly empty space has a ground-state energy which we observe 'manifesting' as particle/antiparticle production/annihilation. If we extrapolate this to an extreme, there will be a limit on how much (p/a p/a) any given unit of spacetime can produce. This has not been determined experimentally or, as far as I know, theoretically, but according to the 1LoT it must be limited.

This mass can be directly observed as seemingly 'spontaneously' created particles. These particles appear to undergo state changes from [spacetime] to [energy] to [mass] and back again. Hence spacetime is material.\n\n \n **\n Now, aside from speaking in disconnected phrases that hop from rock to rock, so to speak, you seem to be trying on materialist Humpty Dumpty re-definition of \"mass\". Here is tha standard [yeah, old-fashioned and meaningful], definition of mass, from the sam,e source, above--\n \n \"(Abbr. m) Physics. A property of matter equal to the measure of an object's resistance to changes in either the speed or direction of its motion. The mass of an object is not dependent on gravity and therefore is different from but proportional to its weight.\"\n \n What in the name of heaven relates 'mass', as above, to whatever it is that you are calling 'spacetime'?!? As far as I [and my definition] are concerned, 'mass' is simply a measurement, i.e., a measurement of inertial resistance, by which the 'mass' of anything correlates to its inertial state and the amount of force/energy required to effect a change in that inertial state.\n \n So unless you can identify and measure the amount and kind of 'force/energy' required to change the inertial state of a perfect vacuum, you are talking through you hat, if you'll pardon the expression. No offence meant.\n \n It would seem to me that you are playing dangerously close to 'creatio ex nihilo, ab nihilo'.\n \n \n\n *What is known as 'spontaneous emmission' is a great way to envisage mass-energy symmetry.\n\n \n **\n More, 'spontaneous generation', 'creatio ex nihilo, ab nihilo'? Magick, IOW?\n \n \n\n When a particle emits a photon \n\n \n **\n Excuse me, but isn't a photon a massless particle, all by itself? So what are you saying here/ That a massy particle can 'emit' a massless particle out of its own being?\n \n \n\n it can literally be described as having converted some of itself into a photon,\n\n \n **\n I seriously doubt that that this assertion can be defended rationally. Once again you are appealing to causeless change, 'creatio ex nihilo, ab nihilo' and changing that which is, in and of itself, totally passive, (i.e., a particle), into something which is essentially dynamic, i.e., essentially self-directed.\n \n In fact, AFAICT, what is actually happening is nothing more than two objects interacting upon each other so as to cause one or both of them to passively change. Something that goes on everywhere, all the time.\n \n \n\n and as a result drops to a lower 'energy state' which effects its interactions with other particles in a very real and very mechanical sense. \n\n \n **\n Namely? And I still do not see your point. What is it?\n \n \n\n Like I said, I won't give a deadline but the above topics are at least vaguely relevant to what I will say, and they were mentioned in my now-lost response. I have, so far, refrained from responding until you have finished quoting me, even when it has often taken you 3 or 4 posts to respond to one of mine. I hope you will extend to me the same courtesy.\n\n \n **\n Of course!! And I hope your computer problems will be overcome without any great expense or drastic action. Good luck.\n \n P.S. But don't try blaming the time spent on nubile blonde bimbos on your computer! I wouldn't blame you for it, anyway. Sigh.",

Antimatter is matter also, it just has the opposite charge for equivalent particles! And particles of anti-matter are made in experimental setups on a routine basis. And you know what its those darn materialists who do the experiments! The real mystery at this time is why there is so much more matter than anti-matter in the current universe.
