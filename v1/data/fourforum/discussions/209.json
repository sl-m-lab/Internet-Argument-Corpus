   "Einstein and any highschool boy can get the concept of limits of infinty.For one instance,there are infinite numbers of real numder\n between the integals 1 and 2 .Says 1.9999999999................\n so we definite it will converge to 2 as its limit.Also the base for natural logrithm is not a exact Manitude . (e).You kown what you got directly from Bible the meaning of infinty\n \n Einstein has said in French to some Supernatural addicters \n \"Ce n'est pas s'erienux\"\n I did not that he has any connections with socialism.Also he is not a Right wing Germany\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n Ce n'est pas s'erienux\n BUt i can also declare my self as to be God or creater of the world\n \n After i create the God ,I loss my power,and now i reborn as to be so humble .Therefore i wait for my succeeder(god or Jesus) to save me.And i promise never Violate God again AS i true to say i losse my power after create so mighty a GOd \n \n I blees God God bless You **************Laplace181",

   "this thread is kinda stupid for the following reasons:\n 1. there is a lot of grammatical mistakes, and most of the sentences sound kinda awkward.\n 2. infinity is an ambiguous word. everyone knows there are infinitely many infinities. which one are you talking about?\n 3. there are infinite number of reals? but which infinite? there are inifinitely many integers, too, and the infinite number of reals is obviously larger than the infinite number of integers.\n 4. the base of the natural logarithm is e, and it is an exact number! it's not rational, but it's exact. it sure as heck is not time varying. \n 5. a point is dimensionless (i.e. no dimension). a dimension is, loosely speaking, a degree of variability, or an additional vector that is independent of all others in the basis. a point is not one dimension because there is no variability; it's zero in dimension. a single dimension is typically represented by a line, geometrically speaking, although anything else with one degree of variability can be one-dimensional. maybe \"degree of freedom\" rings a bell? people also talk about space-time as being a 4-manifold on some high dimensional space. this is hard to verify because it is difficult to get global properties of the space from local geometry on a manifold, which is all we have if we're living on a 4-manifold. i can go on forever about this, but this is pretty long.\n 6. whether time is a dimension depends on a lot of things.",
