MoveOn.org has been bashing Bush and all Republicans for over a year, equating Bush to Hitler, trying to get Bush censured, and trying to get Rumsfeld fired.

But Kerry is cherry-picking and targeting the ads against him, and he won't denounce the other ads and fellow Democrats who are speaking out against Bush calling him a liar, a thug, and Hitler. It works both ways. You either denounce all ads like that, or you denounce none of them. You can't just pick the ones that hurt you, and leave the ones that help you.",

Even if they have proved 4 wrong, the SBVFT have proved Kerry wrong in at least 3 instances.\n\n \n And they are being challenged by people who don't support Kerry but support the truth. Also, they are being lead by a liar himself, as well as hiring the same guys who went after McCain, not to mention having a major who said he lied when he participated in unfit for command. I don't doubt Kerry lied, but these guys are scum. O'neill got his butt kicked by Kerry in a debate and was hired by Nixon to specifically go after Kerry, so his own credibility is seriously in question. The whole thing reeks of dirty politics. It seems most of them are simply out to get Kerry for what he said AFTER the war, and lying about what happened during the war doesn't seem to bother them. \n \n \nSo they are telling some truth. I'm sure all of what they're saying isn't true, but I'm also very certain that some of it is. You seem to have avoided skylopps questions about MoveOn.org's ads.\n\n \n I haven't seen a moveon.org ad so I can't comment. I already mentioned that I have only seen 2 ads in the past 5 months and that both were aganist Kerry. I do not live in a swing state.

You seem to have ignored that. \n \n \nI agree that all of these 527 groups should either be eliminated or have certain restrictions imposed upon them.

However, the SBVT claims are based entirely upon 30 year old fuzzy memory. That in itself should make you question the entire campagin. At least the attacks on Bush about his service record actually deal with records. The attacks on Kerry are all circumstantial. \n \n \n\n And what do you think the motives of MoveOn.org are?\n\n \n To remove Bush from office by highlighting his policy failures. \n \n As for cherry picking, you REALLY don't want to accuse Kerry of doing that while supporting Bush. The whole science thing and Bush is a key example of Bush's cherry picking and outright lying.",
