   "Does all criticism of this Republican administration automatically translate to a compliment to the previous Democratic President? Can't Republicans just take criticism at face value? Isn't it possible that our leaders over the last few years just haven't done a great job? Over the history of this nation we know some Presidents have done well and some haven't done so good. If your thrilled with the job he's done, by all means cast your vote for re-election. On the other hand, for the majority of Americans that aren't thrilled, respect the fact that they're genuinely unhappy. As for the tax cuts, I was the recipient of a slight decrease in Federal taxes. That was quickly offset by increases at the state, county, city, and local level due to decreased Federal funding. Think about it, we aren't collecting enough money now to pay our bills, is this the best time to cut taxes? I know everybody wants to pay less, but if you get slammed in your local community with higher taxes to offset less Federal funding is it really a tax cut? Unless your going to eliminate all the programs that rely on tax money, you might as well get comfortable with the fact that you're going to support them in one shape or another. Besides, the largest tax savings went to those that paid the most taxes, (the rich), and I don't begrudge them, but they are the least likely to spend the money in our economy. They already spend what they want. As for jobs coming back, good jobs will come back when American labor can compete with China, and I don't see that happening any time soon. However, you are correct, jobs, which can be anything from a Walmart checker to a fast food worker are being created. The sad thing is we shut down a steel mill where workers make $70,000 (???) annually and build a discount store that pays $7.00 per hour with no benefits. But, a job's a job.",

   "The simple answer is that Bush really has nothing to do with these numbers and Clinton had nothing to do with his numbers.

   "Broker, I would agree to some extent that the President doesn't have total control over the state of the economy. There is one major area, however, that he has significant control over; consumer confidence. When the American public is confident with the fiscal and foreign policies that are implemented by our administrations, they are more apt to spend their money and stimulate the economy, which in turn creates jobs, etc., etc. When they are displeased, or uncertain about the direction of our policies, they tend to hold their money close to home. Look at the historical graph of the Dow Jones index after 9/11, the anticipation of war with Iraq, the invasion of Iraq, and even some of the negative events that have occurred recently in Iraq and around the world. Secondly, no one said that we weren't creating any jobs. The point is, job creation is falling short of expectations and this administration will likely end its 4 year term with a net loss of jobs. In addition, I question the quality of jobs. I work in the \"heavy\" manufacturing sector and I haven't seen anything other than a steady exporting of jobs for the last several years (before Bush). Lastly, you make 3 statements regarding the overall condition of corporate America:\n \n \"1. Companies have been experiencing record profits.\n 2. Companies have record amounts of cash on hand.\n 3. Employee productivity has already peaked.\"\n \n Can you please post a credible link or links to back any of this information up?",

And we (US) don't have to write down minimum wages to adjust unemployment, it reduces itself by a reporting structure that dismisses those who exhaust unemployment benefits. Reporting inflation in the US is another prime example making numbers say what one wants by inclusion or exclusion. The US standard (government and public brokerage houses) inflation number excludes transportation and food.

If the public is fooled by statistics that their inflation is lower than in reality, it is possible to trade some higher inflation for some lower unemployment ;)\n\n \n The rule of thumb for developed countries is 65% of GDP on internal transactions. The US has been running at 75%+, with the bulk of the excess furnished by public (primary) and consumer debt. While the US has a huge internal market, that's an advantage only if we're producing our own goods. We're not and our trade deficit is averaging around $40 billion/month, another massive drain of the country's wealth. The soft dollar has not helped our exports to any great degree as we're in the process of migrating from an industrial to service sector, with the bulk of the trade imbalance (90%) in durable goods, not services. Government influences such as allowing the dollar to decline, tariffs to protect grossly overpaid and benefited jobs and massive military/government spending are tired political exercises in expanding the GDP for better numbers to sooth the public while in reality they reduce consumer purchasing power without a corresponding increase in real income as provided by true economic growth. \n \n As we don't have more money chasing fewer goods but a devalued currency chasing abundant goods with no industrial demand for expansion credit, leaving interest rates at rock bottom, IMO we're not experiencing true inflation, we're just feeding on our national wealth. We are experiencing alarming trade deficits, amassing annual public debt getting near the actual federal operating budget with little debt service requirements due to current interest rates, have realized substantial reduced tax revenues over the past three years, all with no sign of anyone pulling up on the reins.\n \n I personally see no possibility of increasing federal tax revenues due to the decline of our industrial sector and resultant loss of investment and wage income. Foreign investors have been fleeing from our equity markets, dominated by pension funds capable moving the numbers of public companies trading at or above book values up and down at will. Our national debt service is a ticking time bomb, as is our trade imbalance, also financed at low interest rates. Over the past two years I've watched the shift of resources for social spending being pushed down from a federal level, displaced by expanded military and human resource spending, to local levels where tax increases have often been horrendous. Most US State constitutions bar them from incurring public debt for purposes other than education or transportation improvements. \n \n Not a pretty picture, and certainly not a situation that can be sustained on an indefinite basis with our voracious appetites for imported oil, durable consumer goods and unilateral military agression, all on borrowed money. I consider the employment issue a red herring.",
