   "If you ask 10 economists what they think about the US housing market, you will get 12 different opinions. Throw in the opinions of journalists (amateur and paid), talking heads, Wall Street barons, real estate agents, and government officials, and it's no wonder the general public is confused and ill-informed.\n \n The Headlines\n \n According to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the median home price appreciated (year-over-year) on average 4.3% per year from 1980 to 2001. The average year-over-year appreciation from 2001 through June 2006 was 10.2% per year. \n Several areas have been largely immune to the housing insanity, underscoring the imbalances that exist in the overheated markets. For instance, the following list shows the year-over-year average price appreciation from June 2001 to June 2006:\n \n Indiana 3.2%\n Ohio 3.4%\n Michigan 3.5%\n Iowa 4.3%\n Colorado 4.4%\n Texas 4.2%\n North Carolina 5.2%\n Georgia 5.1%\n Tennessee 5.1%\n \n California 16.4%\n District of Columbia 17.2%\n Florida 16.5%\n Washington 10.0%\n Virginia 13.0%\n Arizona 14.9%\n Nevada 15.8%\n New York 11.6%\n \n Origins of the housing bubble\n \n The FOMC began lowering the discount rate in January 2001 due to the unfolding dot-com implosion. The rate cuts accelerated following the terrorist attacks on 9/11. The discount rate was reduced from 6.5% to 1.00% through 13 sequential cuts between January 2001 and June 2003. The last time the discount rate saw the 1% level was during the late 1950's, and the lowest rate since 1990 was 3.0% during the economic malaise in the fall of 1992. The discount rate remained 1% for one year.\n \n Long-term rates followed short-term rates, and the 30-year conventional mortgage rate hovered around 5% during much of 2003 and 2004. It was a great time to buy a home, and millions of Americans did just that. Home sales volume grew exponentially as many Americans bought their first homes and existing owners traded up to more expensive homes. Even people who didn't buy new homes had the sense to refinance their mortgages and lock in historically rock bottom rates. Many people refinanced multiple times as mortgage rates spiraled downwards and closing costs were nearly eliminated. People were actually bragging about their low mortgage rates. It was weird.\n \n America's economy remained resilient throughout these events, despite the evaporation of substantial dot-com equity and the horrific events of 9/11. The median house price increased year-over-year at rates of 5% to 7% between 2000 and 2003. Although that is a little higher than the historic average, it was reasonable and certainly not unprecedented. House appreciation was strong because historically low interest rates lifted housing affordability to new highs, subsequently causing housing demand to dramatically surge.\n \n The appreciation in housing prices quickened in late 2003. The fourth quarter 2003 OFHEO data showed median price appreciation (year-over-year) rose to 7.7%. In and of itself, this was still not unreasonable or problematic. But it didn't stop:\n \n Year-over-year median price appreciation (OFHEO's HPI)\n 1Q 2003 6.7%\n 2Q 2003 6.2%\n 3Q 2003 5.8%\n 4Q 2003 7.7%\n 1Q 2004 8.1%\n 2Q 2004 9.5%\n 3Q 2004 12.4%\n 4Q 2004 11.4%\n 1Q 2005 12.4%\n 2Q 2005 13.5%\n 3Q 2005 12.3%\n 4Q 2005 13.1%\n 1Q 2006 12.6%\n 2Q 2006 10.3%\n \n This is where theories diverge. What happened?\n \n The 5 Causes of the Residential Real Estate Bubble\n 1. Historically low interest rates lit the fuse on the housing bomb. The correlation between the FOMC's easy money policies and the home price explosion is undeniable in fact and theory. Low interest rates increased affordability for everyone. A $200,000 conventional mortgage at 8.0% requires monthly payments of $1,460, but at a rate of 5% the payment is 25% lower at just $1,100. Renters and young adults were able to purchase their first homes. Existing homeowners traded up to bigger, more expensive homes. A 5% conventional mortgage rate is literally a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and millions of Americans took advantage.\n \n 2. Housing demand outpaced supply on a nationwide scale. Never before has the housing market undergone such dramatic growth and transformation. Planned developments with 200 to 2,000 McMansions sprung up like wildflowers from coast to coast. Residential investment spending soared and skewed the GDP measure throughout 2004 and 2005. Moody's estimated the housing industry added 700,000 jobs from 2001 to 2005 while the wider economy experienced net job losses. Short-term imbalances in supply and demand are not problematic, but when demand persistently exceeds supply, prices rise rapidly.\n \n 3. Beginning in early 2004, excess profits were made by almost anybody willing to enter the residential real estate industry, whether as buyer, investor, developer, flipper, or broker. Even novices were making shameful profits in the housing industry, and their successes were featured in primetime network slots and on the front pages of magazines and newspapers. The housing industry was roundly touted as a safe, sure investment.\n \n 4. The excess profits did not go unnoticed on Wall Street. Non-traditional mortgages were gaining in popularity, but there was limited demand and supply due to regulatory constraints, underwriting guidelines, and common sense. But Wall Street fixed that problem by providing billions (then trillions) of dollars in funding and an eager market for private label mortgage backed securities. Private label MBS issuances doubled from 2001 to 2003, and doubled again between 2003 and 2005. In 2000, private label MBS issuances were less than 20% of the MBS market, but in 2005 they exceeded agency issues for the first time. OFHEO stated in its 2005 enterprise report:\n \n \"The growth in the private-label sector in recent years has reflected the rising share of single-family originations comprised of nonconforming loans. More specifically, the increase in private-label issuance has coincided with the recent increases in lending to households not classified as prime and in originations of non-traditional loans. Private label issuers not only purchase jumbo mortgages but also focus on the more credit sensitive mortgages, including adjustable-rate, subprime, and Alternative-A (Alt-A or reduced documentation) loans.\"\n \n 5. FOMC influence was diminished in the ultra low rate environment. The committee began increasing the discount rate in June 2004, and applied 17 consecutive 25 basis point shocks in an effort to curb overall inflation and slow economic expansion. But the mortgage market largely ignored these actions. In fact, the 30-year FHLMC rate was about 6.25% when the shocks began, and gradually trended <em<downward</em< to 5.6% in July 2005 before returning to 6.25% in December 2005. Mortgage originators followed suit. The committee raised the discount rate 325 basis points over 18 months, but the mortgage market didn't flinch.\n \n The discount rate had fallen so far that it became essentially irrelevant in the mortgage market and other capital markets. Another example of this effect can be seen in commercial banking. Banks lowered their deposit and loan rates during 2001-2003, but their rates flattened out long before the FOMC ceased its rate cuts. At a certain point rates can't go any lower without becoming perverse. The same is true in the mortgage market. Rates can go only so low before interest income fails to meet the fixed costs of operations. At that point mortgage rates stopped falling even though the FOMC continued to reduce the discount rate. This is why mortgage rates failed to react to the FOMC rate shocks during 2004 and 2005.\n \n The correlation between the discount rate and the 30-year mortgage rate is obvious. For instance, between February 1994 and February 1995 the committee raised the discount rate 300 basis points, and the 30-year mortgage rate rose 175 basis points. From June 1999 to May 2000 the committee raised the discount rate 175 basis points, and the 30-year mortgage rate rose 113 basis points. From July 1990 to October 2006, the two rates generate an R squared value of 0.48, but the R sqared falls to 0.09 from September 2001 to October 2006. The correlation broke down in the ultra low rate environment.\n \n Adding to the problem is the narrowing spread between short- and long-term rates. The yield curve has been hovering around the inversion point since early 2005. This has further reduced the effectiveness of the FOMC rate shocks, although the forces that are flattening the yield curve are obviously originating from the global financial and commodity markets. At just over 1%, the current spread between 30-year mortgage rates and the discount rate is meager and persistent. The spread has averaged just over 3% since 1990.\n \n The FOMC largely determines short-term rates, whereas the markets generally determine long-term rates, but the two are closely correlated in practice and theory. Slowing the 'frothy' housing market was surely a secondary or tertiary objective for the FOMC in 2004 and 2005, but the patient ignored the diagnosis.\n \n From June 2004 to December 2005 the national median house price increased a silly, unsustainable 20%.\n \n What now?\n As of November 2006 the correction has barely begun. Mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures remain generally low, although some areas have already experienced spikes in these events. Both delinquencies and foreclosures are going to grow at a blistering pace during 2007.\n \n Although prices are falling and home sales are slowing, that is the mere tip of the iceberg. The hidden part of the iceberg is the real danger, and it is predominantly unqualified home owners. There are thousands of people living in homes they can't afford, and those homes are losing value. Most owners are still hopeful that things will get better. They are delusional. Far from increasing, prices are going to continue falling throughout most of 2007, and many of these people are going to walk away from their homes and mortgage obligations. This will be the second wave of the correction, and it will be disastrous for the wider economy.\n \n Where did I get this crazy idea? In November 2005 a $2.2 billion private label MBS pool was securitized and sold as bonds to investors by Countrywide Home Loans. This was one of many such MBS bonds created by Countrywide, and Countrywide is just one of many entities that created similar MBS bonds during 2003 - 2006. Such MBS bonds are the reason private label MBS issuances surpassed agency issuances for the first time during 2005.\n \n Back to the November 2005 Countrywide MBS pool - we'll call it by its formal name - CWABS 2005-16. You can download the prospectus at the SEC's EDGAR website.\n \n The document is very long and convoluted. Here are some excerpts from the introduction:\n \n $2,209,500,100\n (APPROXIMATE)\n \n CWABS, INC.\n DEPOSITOR\n \n [COUNTRYWIDE HOME LOANS LOGO]\n SELLER\n \n COUNTRYWIDE HOME LOANS SERVICING LP\n MASTER SERVICER\n \n CWABS ASSET-BACKED CERTIFICATES TRUST 2005-16\n ISSUER\n \n ASSET-BACKED CERTIFICATES, SERIES 2005-16\n Distributions are payable on the 25th day of each month,\n beginning in January 2006\n \n THE CERTIFICATES\n \n Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2005-16, represent undivided beneficial\n ownership interests in a trust fund. The trust fund consists primarily of a pool\n of fixed and adjustable rate, credit blemished mortgage loans that are secured\n by first liens on one- to four-family residential properties and certain other\n property and assets described in this prospectus supplement. In addition, the\n Class AV and adjustable rate subordinate certificates represent undivided\n beneficial ownership interests in a trust referred to as the swap trust, the\n primary assets of which will be the swap trust's rights under the swap\n administration agreement referred to in this prospectus supplement.\n \n THE MORTGAGE LOANS\n \n The mortgage pool will consist of fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans that\n are secured by first liens on one- to four-family properties. The mortgage loans\n will be divided into four separate groups. Each such group of mortgage loans is\n referred to as a \"loan group.\" Loan group 1 will consist of first lien\n conforming balance fixed rate mortgage loans. Loan group 2 will consist of first\n lien fixed rate mortgage loans. Loan group 3 will consist of first lien\n conforming balance fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans and loan group 4\n will consist of first lien fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans.\n \n These are subprime borrowers who have had difficulty managing their finances in the recent past. Most of these people would have been renters five years ago because nobody would lend them money to buy a home. Now, mortgage originators are courting these people, and Wall Street is transferring most of the risk to investors who may or may not fully understand the risks.\n \n More excerpts from the prospectus:\n \n THE MORTGAGE LOANS WERE UNDERWRITTEN TO\n COUNTRYWIDE HOME LOANS'S STANDARDS FOR\n CREDIT BLEMISHED MORTGAGE LOANS.\n MORTGAGE LOANS UNDERWRITTEN TO SUCH\n STANDARDS WILL EXPERIENCE HIGHER RATES\n OF DELINQUENCY AND LOSS THAN MORTGAGE\n LOANS UNDERWRITTEN IN A MORE\n TRADITIONAL MANNER\n \n Talk about a loaded statement. How much higher? Nobody knows, because massive subprime mortgage lending is a new industry. However the experiences in the subprime auto lending industry might be insightful. Subprime auto lending mushroomed in the 1990's, and even the big, conservative banks jumped in the game. In the late 1990's and early 2000's those large banks abandoned subprime auto lending after realizing several billions of dollars in loan losses. Turns out they underestimated the credit risk. And car loans are small compared to home loans. How much higher?\n Back to the prospectus:\n \n Furthermore, changes in the values of the mortgaged properties may have a greater effect on the delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss experience of the mortgage loans in the mortgage pool than on mortgage loans originated in a more traditional manner. No assurance can be given that the values of the related mortgaged properties have remained or will remain at the levels in effect on the dates of origination of the related mortgage loans.\n \n Again, how much greater? Nobody knows.\n \n Any Mortgage Loan may be prepaid in full or in part at any time; however,\n approximately 61.11%, 97.22%, 67.83% and 80.29% of the Mortgage Loans in the Statistical Calculation Pool in respect of Loan Group 1, Loan Group 2, Loan\n Group 3 and Loan Group 4, respectively, in each case by stated principal balance of the Mortgage Loans in the Statistical Calculation Pool in respect of the\n related Loan Group, and any Subsequent Mortgage Loans may, provide for the\n payment by the borrower of a prepayment charge on certain prepayments made with respect to the Mortgage Loans.\n \n Who agrees to a prepayment penalty on their home mortgage? Desperate people with no money and no other options. And in the case of CWBS 2005-16, a vast majority of the borrowers are desperate.\n \n Here are two more telling statistics about 2005-16 borrowers:\n \n LOAN GROUP 1\n \n Weighted Average Mortgage Rate.................. 7.387%\n Weighted Average Credit Bureau Risk Score....... 606 points\n \n LOAN GROUP 2\n \n Weighted Average Mortgage Rate.................. 6.796%\n Weighted Average Credit Bureau Risk Score....... 619 points\n \n LOAN GROUP 3\n \n Weighted Average Mortgage Rate.................. 7.704%\n Weighted Average Credit Bureau Risk Score....... 595 points\n \n LOAN GROUP 4\n Weighted Average Mortgage Rate.................. 7.284%\n Weighted Average Credit Bureau Risk Score....... 615 points\n \n During most of 2005 it was possible to obtain a 30-year conventional mortgage at 5.5% to 6.0%. Why are these people paying 7% or more? Because renting is their only alternative. And note the credit scores. Not too long ago most banks wouldn't give you a car loan if your credit score was below 620.\n \n I'll note two last characteristics of 2005-6. First, about 17% of the loans, $364 million, require interest-only payments during the first 2 to 5 years. Either these borrowers are intelligently managing their cash flow, or they can't afford to amortize a 30-year loan when interest rates are at historic lows. Based on their credit scores, they are incapable of intelligently managing their cash flow. They are just desperate.\n \n Second, 2005-16 is predominantly composed of adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). These loans have exploded in popularity during the housing bubble because 1) they oftentimes have very low introductory interest rates, and 2) they sometimes allow negative amortization for a fixed period. Again, are these people managing their cash flow, or are they just desperate?\n \n And don't even get me started about the amount of fraud that has probably played a large role in this bubble.\n \n CWABS 2005-16 is but one of many, many similar MBS bonds that have been packaged and peddled by Wall Street since 2002. Wall Street provided the funding and risk transfer mechanisms necessary for subprime mortgage lending to grow wildly. Many of these borrowers have no chance of amortizing their loans. They were hoping home prices would continue to rise, and they would flip the house or refinance at some time in the future. Home prices are done rising, and these people have limited capacity to support these loans. As rates continue to rise and these loans begin to require amortizing payments, the borrowers are going to walk away from their homes and loans.\n \n What will house prices do if 17% of current owners walk away from their homes? What if only 5% walk away? In either case, home prices are going to be falling for a long, long time to come.",

   "Here's a few recent headlines about the surge in subprime, private label MBS activity. Overall private label MBS securitizations, including non-traditional loans to prime borrowers, have been the fuel on the housing price fire.\n \n \n Subprime MBS Issuers Shatter Volume Records in Busy 2004Issuance of subprime securities soared to new heights in 2004, a new Inside B&C Lending analysis and ranking reveals. In a performance that confounded many pundits - who expected volume to fall or hold steady last year amid a waning refinance wave - subprime MBS volume rose 98.2 percent, to a record $401.46 billion, on a year-to-year basis in 2004. \n \n Subprime Mortgage Securitization Volume Continues Finding New Record Highs in 2005Despite increasingly numerous regulatory hurdles and growing competition from the Alternative A market, the lively subprime mortgage securitization business continues to boom in 2005. According to a new ranking and analysis by Inside MBS & ABS, a record $136.21 billion of subprime MBS were issued during the second quarter of this year.\n \n Growth of Subprime Mortgage Market Raises QuestionsThe recent emergence and rapid growth of subprime mortgage lending-making loans to people with weak credit histories-have helped to make home ownership accessible to many people who previously could not qualify for a home loan. That growth, in turn, has helped boost the nation's home ownership rate to unprecedented levels.\n New types of risk\n But the surge in subprime mortgages is also creating new forms of risk to subprime borrowers, holders of securities backed by subprime mortgages, and potentially the wider marketplace of housing finance. Observers, regulators, and markets don't yet fully understand the risks because the phenomenon is new, said Robert A. Eisenbeis, executive vice president and director of research at the Atlanta Fed.\n The risks stem mainly from the nature of subprime mortgages: Most are two- or three-year adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) tied to short-term benchmarks such as the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), a widely used standard in real estate lending. In fact, 66 percent of the subprime mortgages that were purchased and packaged into mortgage-backed securities in 2004 were two-year ARMs, and another 19 percent were three-year ARMs, according to Lehman Brothers and the Federal Housing Finance Board. \n Rising rates heighten risk\n Consequently, beginning in 2006 and continuing through at least 2014, the rates will reset on at least 60 percent of subprime mortgages. Most analysts believe subprime borrowers face long odds against ARM rates declining.\"If history is any guide, it is unlikely that mortgage interest rates will drop further,\" Eisenbeis said.\n Since the general trend recently has been rising rates, most subprime mortgage holders-who tend to be less affluent than prime borrowers-will likely see their monthly payments increase next year. Such increases heighten the risk of foreclosures and a corresponding deterioration in the quality of the subprime loans that underlie mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Roughly $420 billion-$430 billion in subprime MBSs were issued in 2004, according to Lehman Brothers and Inside MBS & ABS.\n A concern for the MBS market is the question of who owns subprime MBSs, Eisenbeis said, and who is liable for those mortgages in the event of a default.",

   "Regulation AB was enacted by the SEC in mid-2006. Among other things, the reg requires issuers of MBS bonds to provide additional information about MBS securitizations. It also requires issuers to provide static pool information anytime a distribution is made (that is essentially monthly for MBS pools). Since enactment of the reg, prospectuses for private label MBS securities have more than doubled in size.\n \n The issuers are generally choosing to comply with the static information requirement by providing online access to current data about delinquencies, losses, balances, and other performance data. Most issuers are retroactively providing this data for many vintages prior to 2006. You can find the website for the static data in MBS prospectuses issued after about June 30, 2006. You can find prospectuses at the SEC's EDGAR website. There's an EDGAR link on the front of Home Economics. You can also find prospectuses by Googling \"RMBS prospectus\" (Residential Mortgage Backed Security).\n \n For instance, this link provides static data for all of Countrywide's subprime MBS issuances:\n \n http://www.countrywidedealsdata.com/RegABDealList.aspx?CWDD=02200606\n \n Click the vintage and loan group number, then hit the performance data button.\n \n Here's the link for all of Bear Stearns' Alt A pools:\n \n http://www.bearstearns.com/transactions/sami_ii/balta2006-5/BALTA_2006-5_Performance.pdf\n \n Alt A loans are also called low doc, streamlined, or SISA (stated income, stated assets). Real estate agents and mortgage brokers affectionately refer to them as \"liar loans\". Recent data indicates many Alt A loans are given to wage earners who would only need to provide a recent pay stub to substantiate their income. Why are they choosing Alt A loans? Alt A loan rates are significantly higher than full documentation loan rates.\n \n Here's a link to Lehman Brothers static data:\n \n http://www.lehman.com/reg_ab/deal.html?deal=LXS06-15\n \n Lehman is the reigning subprime champion.\n \n Spend some time persusing the prospectuses and static data.

   "(Most of) The dot com equity never existed. There was no hole to be filled. It's like the 30-year Enron employee complaining that he lost his $1 millioin retirement account. No, he didn't. He lost the $50,000 he conributed, plus a reasonable return over 30 years, so maybe he lost $100,000. The other $900,000 never existed. And so with the dot com billions, it never really existed.\n \n Stocks went from $20 per share to $120 per share, and back to $5 per share, but only $15 was lost because most of the stocks sat in pension funds, mutual funds, or restricted accounts from the day they were issued until the day they crumbled. Some people lost tremendous amounts of real equity, but the average American had no skin in the game. That is why the dot com bust was a non-event for most Americans and the American economy.\n \n The money that flowed into the residential market over the past 4 years is new money in the system, created from healthy American corporate profits, surpluses in central banks in Japan, China, India, and the OPEC countries, and vast amounts of speculative money from successful people and organisations around the world.\n \n The Fed's easy money policies certainly encouraged the flows, but the Fed didn't create the money or the bubbly market. The difference between the housing bubble and the dot com bubble comes down to cash. (Most of) The dot com equity was make believe, but most of the housing investment has been funded by real cash from real people. When housing crashes, there will be billions of dollars of lost equity, real equity.\n \n Jeff",

The rates are so low that it's not worth doing.\n\n \n As an internal transaction economy, the Fed required volume to drive GDP for political purposes. As I see it all they did was facilitate developed real estate growth through low interest rates. The fundamental appeal of bond investment was present, dedicated revenue stream to service debt, but corrupted by upward adjustable interest rates qualified at minimum rates of disposable income with questionable qualifying requirements in a time of wage stagnation. Junk bonds. A nice sleigh ride for a few years, but interest rates on US securities due to the failing USD had to be raised to sell them (under the guise of controlling inflation) and poof went the real estate market. I'd think dual discount rates had to be discussed more than once by the Fed. \n \n Other than volume and real estate bonds throwing off what's probably in many cases temporary revenue, I see no difference in the .com run up and real estate.
