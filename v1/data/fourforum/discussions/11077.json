   "I propose an experiment to test the power of christian prayer. The 65 teams playing in the NCAA Tournament have been announced. As usual, several of these teams are christian schools, the highest seed among them being Xavier, seeded 3 in the West.\n \n So let's all decide on a christian school and pray to almighty god for a victory in the tournament by that school.\n \n Here are the Candidates:\n \n Mount St. Mary's (16a East) Roman Catholic\n Oral Roberts (13 South) ???\n St. Joseph's (11 East) Roman Catholic (Jesuit)\n Baylor (11 West) Baptist\n St. Mary's (10 South) Roman Catholic (Christian Brothers)\n BYU (8 West) Mormon\n Gonzaga (7 MidWest) Roman Catholic (Jesuit)\n Xavier (3 West) Roman Catholic (Jesuit)\n \n If I have missed a school or two because of my ignorance of their religious affiliations, please let me know.\n \n However, let me proceed with my proposal. Everyone should forget their own school loyalties and get together and pray to god for the victory of a particular religious school. We need to decide which school.\n \n Here's my opinion. Mount St. Mary's (a real miracle if they won), St. Joseph's, St. Mary's, Gonzaga, and Xavier are all Roman Catholic schools. Most fundamentalist christians think that Roman Catholicism isn't true christianity.\n \n That leaves Oral Roberts, Baylor, and BYU. I'm not even sure of the affiliation of Oral Roberts (probably a magical interpretation of the Baptists), and most christians don't consider Mormonism to be christian. That leaves Baylor. Founded by Southern Baptists, but now pretty much middle of the road christian dogmatic.\n \n I think that everyone should pray that Baylor will win. That will mean that Baylor will have to beat 8 Purdue, 3 Xavier, 2 Duke and 1 UCLA, or who ever beat any of those teams, to reach the final four, where they will face Memphis or whoever beat Memphis, and then either UNC or Kansas or whoever beat them.\n \n Let's show everyone the power of prayer and pray for a Baylor victory.\n \n If you have another suggestion, the please speak up. We have to hurry to decide who we are going to pray for. The opening round is tomorrow, the 18th, and the first round begins on Thurs, Mar 20.",

It's unofficially official for teams to pray before the game, and while most ask for a good, safe game, many ask for a win. Because not both teams can win, how does God decide? Does one team pray harder, or just play harder? Or does God have a plan, in which case the praying doesn't matter?",
