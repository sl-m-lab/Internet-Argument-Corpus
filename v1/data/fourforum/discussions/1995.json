   "WorldTraveler, I agree totally, and would dare say that omniscience would mean the ability to expand that \"possibility tree\" indefinitely, considering all the possible outcomes and all the possible choices. therefore God knows all futures. but he doesnt know which future will actually play out\n \n but many christians believe that God knows which specific future will play out. that is, which specific decision path of the tree will actually happen. and this is what conflicts with free will. if the specific path is already predetermined, then the branches are non-optional, therefore free will doesnt exist. I disagree that God knows what decision man will make\n \n I agree with eddie and phunting that time travel will be impossible for the same reason. the future is actually a tree of infinite roads, and only one of those roads can be taken, but the choices to take these roads are constantly before us. if time travel were possible (in theory), then we may be able to travel along one of these paths to see the possible outcome, but it would not be travelling into our future per se, just into a possible future. therefore 2010 could be infinitely differenet depending on which choice path you took, but it still would not mean you predicted the future.\n \n to a certain extent, in our own minds we can simulate time travel in the same way, just imagine the possible outcomes and consequences of a choice before actually making the choice. you wouldnt really be predicting the future, but in a way you could, because it is possible to tell the outcome of many of our decisions before we make it",

   "you typed this out manually?\n \n select the text you want to copy, then right-click and select \"copy\" (or press ctrl+c, then place the mouse in the reply box and right click select paste (or press ctrl+v)\n \n\"God knows the future of what the free will creatures choose. Free will does not stop becoming free because God knows what will happen. For example, I know that my child will choose to eat chocolate cake over a bowl full of stinking dead mice. If I were to set them before my child, it is safe to say she will not eat the dead mice. Knowing this is not taking away the freedom of my child since she is freely choosing one over the other.\n Likewise, for God to know what a person will choose does not mean that the person has no freedom to make the choice. It simply means that God knows what the person will choose. This is necessarily so since God knows all things (1 John 3.20). Besides, if a person were to choose A instead of C, then that is what God would have known would happen.\n\n you may say the child is much more likely to eat the chocolate cake than the dead rats, but the choice still leaves open the possibility that the child can still eat the dead rats if she wanted. there is never 100% certainty when it comes to choice\n \n \nFurthermore, if God knows all things and knows what we are going to choose, then by definition, we are still making the choice; after all, the arguement says that God knows what \"we are going to choose\". If \"we are going to choose\" something, then we realy are making the choice-- otherwise it wouldn't be logical to assert that God knows what we are going to choose. Choice implies the ability to decide between different options. Again, by definition if God is knowing is knowing what we are going to choose, then He knows what we are going to choose between options...otherwise we are not choosing anything and the statement is illogical.\n\n if it is already preset which choice will be made, then we never truly had the option of making a different choice. if God knew you were going to choose the peach outfit before you chose it, then if you suddenly decided to change your mind and choose the lilac outfit, then you would make God a liar. therefore, since God cannot lie, you have no choice but to wear the peach outfit, and choosing the lilac outfit was really never an option.\n \n \nBack to the bowl of dead mice. The father, however, is not omniscient where God is. But, does this difference negate the analogy? Not at all. Knowing what a person will do still does force them or limit them in doing what is known. The complaint of those who say that if God knows what we are going to do then we don't have \"real\" freedom is logically stating that Gods foreknowledge of an event somehow limits the event and the choice of the individual. The complaint implies that there is an action by God upon a person that negates his freedom to choose. It would be up to the complainer to establish some logical connection between what God knows what will happen and the mind of the one who makes a choice so that the mind of of the person making the choice no longer is making a choice. It seems that the critics are saying that the choice-maker is affected by Gods knowledge to such an extent that his freedom is lost. If that is the case, then can they prove this logically? If not, then how can they maintain their position?\n\n 1st of all, the father can never be 100% certain that the child will choose the chocolate over the dead mice. if the child, for whatever reason, decides to choose the dead mice, then the analogy falls apart. choice is such that the options all have a probability of being selected. the odds may be leaning heavily on one side or the other, but as long as the possibility is greater than 0, then you still cannot predict the choice. and if the child has 0 possibility of choosing the dead mice (the bowl is out of reach/sight, etc) then there was no choice in the matter\n \n \nGod's knowing what we will choose is a function of His omnipresence since He is in all places all the time. If He were not, He would not know what choices we are freely going to make. To deny that God is all knowing, even of the choices we make, is to deny His omnipresence and reduce Gods nature to something more like ourselves, which would be a mistake.\n \n Nevertheless, some people try and claim that God does not know what we will freely choose. But, this can not be since it would violate the biblical teaching that God knows all things.\"\n\n \n ok, this is how God can be omniscient and not know the future. Omniscient means knowing all things knowable; knowing every single thing is. the future does not exist yet, so even if God does not know the future, he is still omniscient, because he still knows everything that is. if you know everything that is, and you dont know what is not, you still know everything, therefore still omniscient",

   "Why must God know a specific choice? Why can he not know all choices?\n \n I have been thinking more on this and I am more convinced that for God to be omniscient and for free will to exist there must be infinite multiple realities that God transcends as a being. We then operate in the web of all realities traveling from one to another by the choices we make.\n \n Of course God knows what choices we make because we make all choices possible. We have infinite selfs that each make every possible choice. Its not a matter of free will causing the other options to be excluded from reality, just the reality that this you is currently operating in. I decide to wear lilac today in this reality, but in another reality I decide to wear blue. Neither negates free will in that I chose which colour I am wearing but the choice moves me to a reality that matches my decision. God knows the OUTCOMES of all the possible choices I make as well as the possible choices I CAN make so it comes as no suprise to him when I wear any colour as I am just moving to the reality that matches my decision.\n \n I am sorry if this doesn't make sense.

If you go into the future and come back it is possible that things could occur differently. That in itself is hard to say. The way God would view time would be more like how we view history. History doesn't change and with good reason, it is already completed. George Washington is known as the first American president today and he will be known as such tomorrow and forever, it will never change. That isn't to say that he didn't have the free will not to be our president. God could see time in this way as well in that it is all history to him. There is one path that will be taken and when that path is set it will no longer change. Since God can view all of time that is sort of like us being able to view all of history. What is history to us is never going to change again as is the case with all of time as God is above it and beyond it and has seen it all transpire already. He didn't travel to the future and come back to see what we are doing today, he is already in the future and the past and the present. It is a hard concept to grasp being in different places and times at once but it really isn't all that different than us being able to read about several different points in history all at once.\n \n The flaw with the idea of traveling to the future and coming back to see it occur is that it requires that a certain period of time pass twice. Time need not pass twice in God's case. That is why there is only one way for it to occur just as true with our own history.",

   "My point was that you cannot use one hypothetical theory to justify another hypothetical theory.\n\n \n I wasn't using a hypothetical theory, I was using a hypothetical situation. It in and of itself had no bearing on my second theory which dealt with God. This is why I am confused as to how you got the two mixed together.\n \n \nWell no I don't. Time travel as you describe it (one unchangeable future) completely negates free will as there cannot be another outcome of every choice made. Just because we do not know which choice we are going to make does not give us free will.\n\n \n I think you are looking too deeply into my example. I'll grant you that there is flaw within my example but that really doesn't have any affect on what the real issue is and that deals with God. The time travel example was meant to be simple to help people think through how God can view time. It wasn't meant as a literal way as to how God can view time. I'll conceed that yes it is entirely possible that if you followed my example to the letter that events may not occur the same way both times but God doesn't actually need to do this time traveling in order to know the future. He is everywhere including the future and past and doesn't need to travel to get to any point in time.\n \n \nTime travel as unkerpaulie describes it (and the Doc in back to the future), with multiple futures allows free will, which allows God to know all possible outcomes (which is really knowing more). Which of the infinite timelines we are personally on is irrelevant therefore, as there is no 'true' one.\n\n \n True. But history never changes. What happens once time is completed and you wish to view it all again as if you were watching a movie? Movies don't change either. What if all of time could be viewed as a movie and God already has the entire copy of all of history taped? It would mean that time was only run through once and that reviewing it does not require time to be repeated. Before I forget, no I don't mean a literal movie with a projector and a theater. Don't think too deeply about it. Just in this overly simplified example wouldn't it seem possible that God could know what will happen next in his movie without it tampering with free will?\n \n To get more complicated with it God is able to watching this whole film all at once without having to rewind or fast forward. It is inherent to being all knowing that he already know everything that will occur.\n \n \nHowever that would mean there are infinite other versions of us, all pursuing infinite different courses. Therefore either there will be infinite copies of us in both heaven and hell or there will be infinite heavens and hells or all judgement is irrelevant as we will make and have made every good and bad decision possible.\n \n Hope that made sense :)\n\n \n If God had to travel through time this might be the case. But now that we are passed that do you still it is as inevitable that this would have to occur if God were all knowing and free will still existed? How would this happen in the context of my latest nonsensical theories.\n \n \nWhich runs totally contrary to your earlier statement that once travelling back again events would pan out exactly as seen.\n\n \n This is not to the contrary of my earlier statement at all. In my earlier statement I painted you as the witness to history repeating through time travel. I never touched on the subject as to what you could possibly do after seeing the future.\n \n \nBut why? The two ideas are mutually exclusive.\n\n \n Not nearly as mutually exclusive as the possibility of creating a square triangle which many believers will insist to both you and I is possible with God. Listen, I'm sure you and I are probably in agreement that God probably doesn't exist and I've also thought many a time and actually took as fact that free will and God knowing our every move would have to be mutually exclusive so I do understand where you are coming from with this. After a lot of thought and conversation I was finally hit with the realization that the two are not mutually exclusive because God is everywhere and is therefore able to view our current day as we could view the previous day. It his history to him and history doesn't change. Just because we cannot change what we did yesterday doesn't mean that we didn't have the free will to change it at that time.\n \n \nI dislike the god could because he is god argument. This brings us back to the age old corker 'could god make a rock so heavy even god cannot lift it?'. The only answer to this is that even god has to be constrained by the laws of what is feasibly possible and logically coherent. Once you start ignoring that it only opens up multiple new problems.\n\n \n I would whole heartedly agree with this statement if not for one thing. It is logically possible for free will and the all knowing God to exist at the same time. If this were some retarded debate about God trying to create an object so small that he could not see it then I wouldn't be debating you about it. It is unbelievable stupid to debate such things as I have seen many believers do in the past. However this argument just makes sense, at least to myself after much time spent thinking about it. It is a very complicated subject to debate and I realize that because I spent so much time on it myself but I think I have an understanding of how it is possible. God being everywhere and in every time is possible the most complicating thing about the whole debate but because his is above time he can see it all and therefore can be everywhere as far as time is concerned. He is not constrained by time therefore the rules of time don't really apply time him. Time is not something he is judged by and he can think of time as something that is visible, something that he can just see. The closest example earthly and mortal example of this that I can think of would be a movie film. We are above it and able to view it, not constrained by the time that the movie is constrained by, and we can view it any which way we choose without having to think that something will be changed by us viewing it.\n \n In this rambling I think I've pretty much stated all the points that I am able to state as far as my knowledge about this subject goes. I hope that you find it useful and if you see a glaring fault in it I hope you tell me what this fault is.",

We may fail to realize that everything was being done by free will since it seems so predictable to us but logically you of course know it was done with free will. So just like in this scenario to God everything is set in stone as it has already happened just like history is set in stone to us. However just as with the building of history there was no set path and there will be not set path for building the future either.\n \n \n1. what is the point of human effort? if something is going to happen regardless, then why try to make it happen or stop it from happening?\n\n \n Human effort is what will build the future. If we were to all just give up right now and just die it would be of our own choice as far as free will was concerned even though God could have seen it all coming as he has already witnessed this event. So the point of human effort is to shape our future at least according to the theory I've laid out.

However just as with the building of history there was no set path and there will be not set path for building the future either.\n\n If God is the director who has a script, he still cannot accurately predict that everyone will follow the script or the movie will go exactly according to plan, unless he removes free will and forces the actors and stage crew to do his will. \n \n as viewers of the movie, the sequence can only be predicted because it happened in the past. you cannot know how the end of a movie is going to be unless you saw/heard/read how it is going to end previously. while the movie is being played, free will of the actors on stage doesnt exist. and that is the only way the movie can be predicted. your analogy is flawed, because free will is irrelevant to replaying something that alrady happened. if the movie was being filmed lived while you are veiwing it, then you could consider free will, but even then it would be impossible, even for the director, to predict exactly how his own movie would end, because everything is spontaneous and happening in real-time",

   "you already said it is impossible to change our predetermined destiny\n\n \n Where did I say this?\n \n \nIf God is so all-powerful that He even knows the future, then not even God has free will.\n\n \n For God to know his future actions he has to have a future.

   "Good point. Of course you know it will be refuted by someone saying 'you can have free will and still have a set future' emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Are you actually mocking me here for being someone who would contend with the statement \"If God is so all-powerful that He even knows the future, then not even God has free will.\"? Lets see here. In post #41 it would appear that I was the first one to bring up the fact that God's being all-powerful would take away his free will. Lets also go back to one of the first threads I've ever posted on these boards entitled \"Is God a robot\":\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=743\n \n I hope you don't think I'm close minded about the issue that God could be lacking in free will any longer even though I'm not set on the idea either thanks to the help and suggestions of many people here on theses forums.\n \n \nIt's not 'manipulation' of free will. It is the simple fact that if what you are going to do is determined then you do not have a real choice in the matter.\n\n \n But I am contending that the future that God sees is the one that you choose for yourself. Therefore your statement does nothing except assume that I am wrong without giving any reason as to why. So I'll state my theory again in a different way here. Since God is everywhere and in everytime he is also at the end of time. Now lets say that you were at the end of time and knew all of history. Since you know history is set in stone would you believe that free will doesn't exist for those who existed before you? I would hope your answer to this is no. So we know that all of history can be played out and written in stone without eliminating free will. Now lets think of God as someone who can only be in one place at a time and that time is at the end of history. He doesn't even watch anything that occurs to the human race until the end of time. So it hits the end of time and everything has occurred and now he can view our history. How hard would it be for him to predict what happened after today if he had done this? It would be no harder for him to do this than it would be for the mortal who lived at the end of time to do so. And since God quite possibly does all things in no particular order considering he is above time it is entirely possible for him to do this and everything else all at once meaning he inherently would know all of our history at the same time that he first creates earth. I don't see how you can be surprised at him knowing the future if this is the case. I'm not say that this is how it has to be, I'm only stating one way that this can work.\n \n \nThis arguement really has nothing to do with God. It is the simple fact that if we have a set destiny, if all of our choices must and will go a specific, unchangable way then how can we be said to choose which way they go? We can't.\n\n \n Because it is like the movie example again. It is made by people with free will and when viewed there free actions are set in stone as far as the watcher is concerned. So the viewer knows the future for the characters while maintaining their free will. This means that even if the future is predictable it can still be one that we freely created for ourselves.\n \n \nGod comes into it because the existence of anything that can show there is a set future also proves that we do not have free will. For the above reasons.\n emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Yes God can predict the future but since he has no constraints he is able to be in the future and the past at the same time. Since he is already in the future it isn't too hard to predict it and it also doesn't mean that there is a set path to the future. Just as if you were at the end of time again and knew the whole history of time it doesn't mean that there was no free will use in creating history. So God is at the end of time meaning it is entirely possible his information about future events derives from that point meaning free will can still exist with him knowing the future.\n \n \nedit: Perhaps I can put it another way. Forget God, forget free will, forget timetravel, forget fortune telling.\n \n Answer this one, simple question:\n \n If something is definitely certainly absolutely 100% unequivocally going to happen, is there a choice as to whether it happens or not?\n\n \n Then lets look at the movie example again. Did Mel Gibson when fliming Bravehart have a choice as to whether he should wear a kilt or not? It sure seems like he doesn't since everytime I view it he is wearing that kilt again. Therefore next time I watch it I know that without a doubt he will be wearing that kilt again. It is 100% unequivocally going to happen. So did he have any free will in making the decision as to whether to wear the kilt or not? I'd say he did. So if God were to watch us on his time movie and we just kept doing the same stuff as we had every other time he watched this movie it may appear to him that we have no free will while infact it is entirely possible that we did have free will during the entire \"filming\".\n \n The thing I think you are not seeing here is that history is set in stone while the future is open to free will. At the end of time the future no longer exists and history is all that is left. Since history is set in stone it is predictable to walk through it after the third of fourth time. God is able to do this as easily as you can pick up a history book and see what happened in 1776. That doesn't mean that free will didn't exist in 1776.",

The event is already completed. This is where you have to keep in mind that God is everywhere and in everytime.\n \n edit: Just read the following post.

Yesterday, 3/30/04 was in the future. Today it has occurred meaning that you can easily accept that God can give a fully accurate and detailed summary of everything that happened. Now I'm sure you can also fully accept that God is not constrained by time. So try to figure out a way to explain how God didn't know what was going to happen on 03/30/04 in the past since he was able to learn what was going to happen today.\n \n You have to understand that since time is not of any concern to God that it is true that everything that he will ever learn is learned instantly. That means that if you can accept that he can accurately depict what happened today that he had to have been able to do so yesterday as well. Free will doesn't even come into play anywhere in this theory either. It is all about the simple fact that since God is not constrained by time that he has to already know what happened on 3/30/04 if he was ever going to learn what was going to happen.\n \n \nNobody is saying that God forces things to happen, that is not the point. The point is that if the future is defined, concrete then there is no free will as whatever we 'choose' is what we must choose. To do otherwise is to prove God wrong.

However the fact is that God has already seen the future occur. How is this possible? The same way that it is required that he know what happened today even before it happened. Since he does nothing in order that means that everything he will ever learn is done all at once meaning if the future occurs then he has to already know everything about it before time is even created. Also it is not required for there to be free will or no free will in order for him to learn any thing. Assuming that free will exists and that free will formed all of todays events it is not hard to understand that today was easy to summarize regardless of the randomness involved in how it was done in. So if it is possible to summarize/learn a days worth of free will based events after they have occurred then it is true that God is able to know the future even when free will exists not because he can foresee it, but because he experienced it.",

Since I believe this whole-heartedly I'm going to focus on just the possible questions about this statement for a moment.\n \n Is our future set in stone? No, it doesn't even exist yet! This is a key principle in my theory.\n \n If the future doesn't exist yet how can God know what will happen in it? Difficult to explain but purely logical to answer. Since God is not constrained by time he cannot possibly just learn what happened on 3/29/04 and then later learn what happened on 3/30/04. It is impossible. He has to learn them both at once. That means if he is ever going to learn what will happen on 3/31/04 he would already have to know it.\n \n Does him knowing it mean that he is forcing it to occur? Absoultely not. Just as we experienced todays events he is able to do so and learn from them. My theory suggests that he does this and only this.\n \n Does free will exist? It doesn't even matter. My theory isn't affected either way. Whether it exists or not it really doesn't matter. This theory will work the same way.\n \n So is it possible for free will to exist and at the same time have a God who can predict the future? Absolutely. I'm sure you will all conceed that God can know what happened on 3/29/04 without having to force people to do what he wants them to do. Not set destiny is required, no force of free will can affect it. 3/29/04 is the past and is easy for us to understand making it simple to understand how God could sit back and experience it himself and be able to know all about it. As stated above this in itself means that if he is able to learn what happened today then he must have known all of this even before it happened. He didn't know it because he forced it to happen but just because he experienced it today and of course todays knowledge didn't occur to him after yesterdays knowledge as he is not constrained by time.\n \n \n If this doesn't answer all your questions I encourage you to ask questions directed at this theory.

   "EDIT: Let me clarify that whenever I talk about God and time constraints I'm talking about the fact that he is not constrained by time. I am not talking about him being able to travel through our time or manipulate it in anyway. I am just focusing on the fact that he does not do things in a time based way ie do this first and this next.\n \n EDIT AGAIN: Also perhaps you should read post 87 before this one and maybe just forget this one all together. I think post 87 summarizes what I was trying to say in my response to you.\n \n \nI do accept that God isn't constrained by time. And I'm not saying that God wouldn't know what happened on said day. I am just saying that his knowledge of what would happen meant there was no chance of any other eventuality happening and therefore there was no free will allowing us to chose ourselves what would happen.\n\n \n I'm not contending that the future even exists yet. God doesn't know what the future will be until it has occurred. But even if the future doesn't exist yet it doesn't matter. Think about this logically. Tomorrow doesn't exist and is not set in stone. However tomorrow will eventually exist meaning that God will know everything about it once it does. That means that he must know what is going to happen already not because he can \"predict\" the future but because he has experienced it. Now tell me how this actually puts the future in stone. You can do whatever you like as the future doesn't exist and technically God is not going to know what you are going to do until you do it. Since he is not constrained by time he is still already able to know the future but he really doesn't know what it is until we create it ourselves.\n \n \nI am also going to interject here, totally off topic, to say that Americans writing the date the wrong way round is very annoying. Especially at work when half the dates are written the right way round and half aren't and it takes you twice as long to do any bloody work because you have to work out which is which! emoticon_frazzled \n\n \n I think it makes sense. I would say in words that it is March 31, 2004 today so I write it as 3/31/04. But thats just my opinion :)\n \n \nIf an event has a 100% chance of occurring one way, is there a choice that the other possibilities occur?\n\n \n But there is not a 100% chance that something will occur. As of right now the future doesn't exist and can be shaped in any way you wish. God can predict nothing that hasn't yet occurred. The part you are missing is the complexity of not being constrained by time. As long as April 1, 2004 will occur how is it possible that God hasn't been able to simply watch it occur already regardless of free will?\n \n \nThe answer is no, there is no choice. I don't see how this can be refuted.\n\n \n But you are missing what I am saying. I am stating that God only learns what you will do after you have done it. Let me set up an example. Lets say God doesn't know what will happen on April 1 right now and does know what happened on March 30. OK so time moves on an he is able to learn what happened on April 1 after it occurs. So we are still together on the fact that he didn't know the future and only learned what happened after it was already completed. Now since God is not constrained by time doesn't that mean that he had to learned what happened on March 30 and April 1 at the same exact time and isn't it possible that he is able to do so by simply allowing the future to occur and without the need to \"predict\" anything?\n \n That is my whole point. He isn't predicting anything at all. He watches it happen. The element of no time constraints makes it confusing to talk about but it makes sense that he is just able to sit back and watch it all happen and then know about it all at once and that would include before time begins.\n \n \nTake an analogy. A baby is holding a rattle. When he drops it we know there is a 100% chance that it will fall to the floor. The baby doesn't know this. When the baby lets go of the rattle it looks to the baby that the rattle had a choice of which direction to fall in, but as we know in actuality it didn't.\n\n \n OK then this is how it would work according to my theory. God doesn't know the baby will drop the rattle until he does. However since God learns all things at once that means he will learn this at the same time he will learn that Adam and Eve have been bad. There is no learning things before or after something for God and that we agree on. What you are not seeing is that this means that God is able to just watch all of time pass by, learn it all at once, and therefore seemingly be able to see into the future but not really. He has only seen what has already occurred.\n \n \nIt is not that we don't understand your point, we do. It's just that your point is logically flawed. \n\n \n I am absolutely sure that you do not understand my point because of what you are stating here. If you are able to conceed that God is unconstrained by time and that it is possible that he knows exactly what happened yesterday only because he was able to witness it occur then you have to conceed that he was able to know what was going to happen yesterday long before it occurred and he was able to do it by just witnessing it, not predicting it. I know exactly where you are going wrong with my theory and that is the fact that God learns all things at once so if it is possible for him to learn things that have already occurred just by witnessing them then it has to be possible for him to know the entire future just by witnessing it, not by predicting it.\n \n \nPlease understand, we are not saying he 'forces' anything. No more than I force gravity to act as it does in the baby analogy. We are just saying that if there can be proof found of an unchangeable future, and God would be one of the forms this proof could take, then free will cannot logically exist.\n\n \n But I contend the future doesn't exist yet. You could even say that since it hasn't occurred yet that God doesn't know what it is. However the very fact that 2004 will end means that it is possible God will be able to sit back and witness it all and in turn means he already has to know what happens.\n \n \nI quite agree, it doesn't matter as far as we are concerned if free will exists or not. \n\n \n That isn't what I'm saying. I'm saying because God is able to simply witness what happens and learn from that it doesn't matter to his learning experience at all whether free will exists or not. Either way he can just learn by witnessing time pass.\n \n \nBut don't you see? This is an inherent contradiction in terms. If someone knows what you are going to do. And that is knows, not just is fairly certain, then how can you have the option of doing anything else?\n\n \n So lets really get this rolling. Yes I agree God knows what will happen tomorrow. You think I believe this because he is able to predict it but that isn't what I'm saying. I state that he knows what will happen tomorrow because will eventually know what happened tomorrow after witnessing it occur meaning that he has to already know what happened and since he is able to learn just through watching and not predicting it is entirely possible that the future doesn't even exist right now as far as we are concerned and there is no contradicting God by doing something he couldn't have predicting because he would have already seen us doing this by witnessing it. Whew.\n \n There is no contradiction in this. God does not witness something before it has happened. God can know what happens tomorrow because he will eventually know it anyways and since he is not constrained by time it makes perfect sense that he would know what happened tomorrow without having to predict it.\n \n \nIndeed. However just because logic cannot explain other aspects of God does not affect the fact it is totally clear on self-contradictory aspects such as omniscience/free will.\n\n \n Of course you could debate this even on a low level. Being all-powerful would mean he can maintain free will without failure. Being all-knowing means he could predict free will without failure. The contradiction isn't actually between being all-knowing and free will but rather between being all-powerful and all-knowing.",

   "OK, please take your time and think about this...\n \n If Gods knows what we are going to do, can we do anything different? If God knows that I am going to wear my grey shirt today, can I possibly wear my blue one? it is impossible to do anything other than what God has seen you do. therefore by him seeing me choosing the grey shirt ahead of time, I cannot possibly choose blue shirt, or any other shirt. please explain how I can possible select other options than the one God has foreseen me choosing. If I cannot possible choose other options, then how can I have free will?\n\n \n First off let me go over what you are responding to:\n \n \"Not even this would eliminate the possiblity of free will existing. God being all-knowing would imply that he has to know what your free will is going to cause you to do. Therefore him knowing about it would not at all take away from your free will. \"\n \n I state here that not even that would eliminate the possibility of free will existing. I am just using the same logic here as I did in my previous post in saying:\n \n \"Being all-powerful would mean he can maintain free will without failure. Being all-knowing means he could predict free will without failure.\"\n \n It is very low level logic but undenyable. If something is actually all-powerful and all-knowing then it can somehow force free will and all-knowing to exist at once without any logic at all. That is why I state that the actual conflict here is between being all-powerful and all-knowing.\n \n I guess I shouldn't have said any of what you are responding to as it confuses what I am actually trying to get at here. What I'm trying to say is that there is a logical way for God to know the future while maintaining free will. That theory has nothing to do with what you are responding to. So I'll get back on track here and answer your question based on my actual logic based theory.\n \n OK so God already knows you're going to wear a gray shirt today. I'll conceed that it is true, he already knows what you will do today but that it could have gone another way. This is of course the definition of a free will/all-knowing God mixed future. It could have gone another way because God didn't really know that you would wear that gray shirt until you already chose to wear it. However in that he is unconstrained by time that means since he was able to learn that this event occurred today by witnessing it he essentially just added that to his memory bank which stretches back to the beginning of time allowing him to know what was going to happen today before time even began.",

   "I seem to have good ideas suddenly pop up when I'm responding to unkerpaulie. This was part of my response to him but I think that it should be in it's own post as it simplifys what I'm trying to say.\n \n Think about it this way. Lets say that God's knowledge bank is at the beginning of time. All his information is stored there. Before today occurred he had no information on what was going to happen. However, once it happened he was able to reach back to that memory bank and put that information in there. That means that the event that he learned about (you putting on a gray shirt) had already happened even though he knew about it since the beginning of time. That is the essence of being unconstrained by time here. You had your choice to make and could have done anything that you wanted to. However since he was able to witness you doing that very event today he was able to know that would actually take place since the beginning of time not because he predicted it, but because he seen it actually happen.",

   "Think about this logically. Tomorrow doesn't exist and is not set in stone. However tomorrow will eventually exist meaning that God will know everything about it once it does. That means that he must know what is going to happen already not because he can \"predict\" the future but because he has experienced it.\nBut this is a contradiction. You cannot say the future doesn't exist but God knows the future because he has experienced it. He can't have experienced it if it doesn't exist! Now I accept that he is not constrained by time, but this means that he is simultaneously in all times at once (despite the apparent contradiction!), but it doesn't mean he can exist in something that doesn't exist! Or that the future exists, but only for God.\n \n \n \nI think it makes sense. I would say in words that it is March 31, 2004 today so I write it as 3/31/04. But thats just my opinion :)\n We write it in a linear mode as in day-month-year, which IMHO makes more sense than jumping around. And we would say today is the 31st of March, 2004. Of course the real annoyance is that the system is not universal, I constantly at work have to work out if something happened on the 1st Jan 2003 or the 12th of Dec 2003, which is quite a big difference! Oh and we are also puzzled as to what exactly happened on the 9th of November?\n \n \n \nBut there is not a 100% chance that something will occur. As of right now the future doesn't exist and can be shaped in any way you wish. God can predict nothing that hasn't yet occurred. The part you are missing is the complexity of not being constrained by time. As long as April 1, 2004 will occur how is it possible that God hasn't been able to simply watch it occur already regardless of free will?\n Of course he can watch it, and simultaneously 'remember' it in the present. However that means that the future does exist and is set in stone. \n \n \n \nBut you are missing what I am saying. I am stating that God only learns what you will do after you have done it.\nI understand that you are saying that. However the fact that the aspect of God in the present can remember what he has learnt in the future means that the future is set.\n \n \n \nI am absolutely sure that you do not understand my point because of what you are stating here. If you are able to conceed that God is unconstrained by time and that it is possible that he knows exactly what happened yesterday only because he was able to witness it occur then you have to conceed that he was able to know what was going to happen yesterday long before it occurred and he was able to do it by just witnessing it, not predicting it.\n I do understand that you are saying that God knows the future by seeing/remembering/witnessing it. However I am saying that this still insists on the fact that the future is set. \n \n \n \nBut I contend the future doesn't exist yet. You could even say that since it hasn't occurred yet that God doesn't know what it is. However the very fact that 2004 will end means that it is possible God will be able to sit back and witness it all and in turn means he already has to know what happens.\n But for God to remember it then it must exist. He may not be constrained by time but he still can't remember things that don't exist.\n \n \n \nThat isn't what I'm saying. I'm saying because God is able to simply witness what happens and learn from that it doesn't matter to his learning experience at all whether free will exists or not. Either way he can just learn by witnessing time pass.\n Apologies, re-reading your post I admit I did miss-interpret that part.\n \n \n \nSo lets really get this rolling.

You think I believe this because he is able to predict it but that isn't what I'm saying.\n I promise you I don't.\n \n In the end the fact that he predicts it or remembers it is irrelevant.

Being all-powerful would mean he can maintain free will without failure. Being all-knowing means he could predict free will without failure. The contradiction isn't actually between being all-knowing and free will but rather between being all-powerful and all-knowing.\nBut the problem is that he cannot be all-powerful. As I said with regards to the question 'can God create a rock so heavy even he can't lift it?' (in this thread, I think). The only answer is that God still has to comply with what is logically coherent. Existing through what doesn't exist isn't.\n \n Hmm I just thought of another one: if God exists in what doesn't exist then does God exist in a universe without God?\n \n edit: sp",

It is logical and there is nothing abstract to understand about it. However, try to explain this to the guys who live in 1776. They have no idea how it is possible that God can know this since 2004 is a long ways away. It becomes very abstract at that point. You end up getting burned at the stake for being a witch. But anyways I think you will see where I'm going with this. Even when 1776 was just first occurring it had to be true that God knew all about what would happen today because it has now occurred and it is impossible that God would learn about 1776 first and 2004 later.

However it would be very difficult for those in 1776 to understand how it is possible. You just have to understand that we are the people in the past in our debate who are having a very difficult time understanding a debate that someone at the end of time would have no problem understanding.\n\n But in 1776 the year 2004 still exists if God knows about it, just in their future. Hence the future exists.",

   "there is nothing wrong with the statements above, and hopefully they are what you have been saying all along. the thing is that this means the future (our future) is already set in stone, and to us free will does not exist in the present (our present)\n\n \n The future is only set in stone because it is already done as far as God is concerned. As far as we are concerned it is not set in stone as it does not exist yet. That is what I have been saying.\n \n \nIf God is outside of our framework of time (our present), and not constrained by time, as you say, then God can know the future before we see it happen\n\n \n Well how can God not know the future before we see it happen? Ask yourself this and think about it. God cannot possibly ever learn anything new so doesn't that mean that he must already know what is going to happen? Also if it is possible for him to learn by witnessing something then isn't it also possible that all his learning is done this way? If both are true then it is possible that he has witnessed the future and that is why he knows about it and of course witnessing doesn't require a set future. The future is simply the past to him even if it doesn't even exist for us yet.\n \n \nyes, but if He had seen in the beginning of time that you were about to pick up that book in a specific point (in our time), then He knew that you couldnt not pick up the book at the same time. therefore, by God's foreknowledge your actions are limited only to that very foreknowledge\n\n \n There is no foreknowledge. He didn't know it would happen until it occurred and by that time of course it was the past.\n \n \nbut right now (in God's time and in our time) the beginning of time had already past. therefore God cannot know what you are going to do and not know at the same time.\n\n \n You are right but even if God goes from not knowing to knowing something then since he is not constrained by time that means at no time did he not know the answer. He always knew the answer. So even if he does not know what will happen tomorrow, once he learns what will happen then he has always known what would happen.\n \n \nIf God exists in all times, then he knows at all times everything you are going to do.\n\n \n No, he knows at all times what you have done.\n \n \nthis means that God already knows what you are going to do next year.\n\n \n He does know only because he has already seen you do them.\n \n \nhe doesnt have to wait till next year (our time) comes around to add those actions to his knowledge store.\n\n \n Of course he doesn't need to wait for anything. Time doesn't constrain him. If he is going to eventually learn what will happen next year then he has to already know what will happen next year.\n \n \nif God exists in all time simultaneously, then there can never be a point in God's existence when he didnt know what happened, simply because he cannot know something and not know something simultaneously\n\n \n Logically there is a time where he wouldn't know what was going to happen but when you look at it abstractly as is necessary when considering time doesn't constrain him then you are correct and there is never a point in God's existence when he didn't know what happened. However I contend that he doesn't know what will happen tomorrow until it has happened but since he needs to learn all things at the same time he has to have already experienced tomorrow and that is how he knows about it.\n \n Also I do contend that he can not know something and then know something at essentially the same time. I contend he didn't know the future until it happened and since time doesn't constrain him that he was able to change that fact into something that he always knew.\n \n \nas long as logic exists, knowledge of the future and free will in the present cannot coexist. either free will exists and predictions of the future can possibly be wrong, or free will does not exist and the future is set in stone\n\n \n I would also contend with this. Simple logic can even show that knowledge of the future and free will can coexist assuming something is all powerful. How in the world can you even debate this? I believe that even complex logic such as my theory can show how the two coexist. If God doesn't know what you will do until you do it but is then able to know this since the beginning of time then I have found the loophole that allows this. Since one side is constrained by time (humans) and the other isn't (God) there is a possibility to have two seemingly contradicting things to happen at the same time. Humans create the future, God learns it, therefore can know what will happen since the beginning of time. The two can easily coexist in numerous ways but even disregarding all-powerful I believe it is possible.",

   "I do understand that. But if God learns everything about the future at the beginning of time then that means that the future exists, because he just learnt it.\n\n \n It doesn't mean the future exists but as long as it will eventually exists then it makes sense that God already has working knowledge about it as he learns all things at once.\n \n \nBut here you are mixing a linear God up with one who is not constrained by time. If he isn't constrained by time then he learns it all immediately and the future exists. If he learns it as it happens then he is constrained by time and the future does not exist.\n\n \n Actually you are almost correct here. Time is linear so it places it's own constraints on how it can be learned. I'm not suggesting that God learns about today first and tomorrow next. It is key to my debate that he learns it all at once. However in how time works it is very linear and therefore unless I want to get really abstract I have to explain how it is first off possible to just learn it day by day for God. If you begin to understand how this is possible I think it will just click for you as to how he can just learn it all at once.\n \n \nGood. I was kinda worried that by this statement:\n \n That you were discounting logic. Without logic we have absolutely no basis for debate.\n\n \n That little section was just a semi-serious comment. Sure it is possible that God can exist in a universe without himself as long as he is all-powerful. It is the very definition of being all-powerful that makes it possible.\n \n \nBut in 1776 the year 2004 still exists if God knows about it, just in their future. Hence the future exists.\n\n \n But you and I both know the \"future\" 1776-2004 has actually already occurred meaning it is possible for free will to be involved even though God knows about it back in 1776.

But here is the kicker. We can also state that God has either not experienced the future or that he experienced it since the beginning of time. He has to do everything at once correct? Therefore he has to have experienced all of time at the same time that he was creating it. Agreed?\n \n So what came first, the experience or the knowledge? Neither came first, the came at the same time since God is not constrained by time. Now with this ugly fact out of the way it shows that neither side can ever prove itself correct. You are saying knowledge came before the experience indicating a future set in stone. I suggest experience came before knowledge meaning free will. But neither of us are right since they came at the same time. However all I am trying to do here is show how it is possible that even if they occurred at the same time it is possible that experience took preference over knowing first allowing for a known future but one of free will as well. So either you agree I am possibly correct on this issue or that I cannot be correct. Either way we are debating something that we cannot actually answer but I would like to show exactly how it is possible that free will and future knowledge can exist at once.",

I dont see how it is logical for God to expect mankind to obey his word and simultaneously know who will obey and who will not. it is either God gives instructions expecting man to choose to follow them, or he already knows who will follow his word, and he needs not expect man to follow his word, which would make giving instructions and advice pointless in the first place.\n \n if the bible/commandments/instructions are really from God, does he expect us to follow them? and if he already knows who will follow them and who wont, how can he still have expectations of what will happen? and if he doesnt have expectations of what will happen (meaning that he already knows what will happen) then why give instructions in the first place?",

The future can only be set in stone based on what happened in the past otherwise it becomes totally unpredictable and illogical.\n\n AMD, if God has seen the future and knows what will happen, then not even changing the past can alter what will happen. if God has seen what will happen in the future, and for some reason that future happens different than what God has foreseen, then it would mean that God's prediction was incorrect. if God has forseen the future, then it impossible for the future to be altered",

   "I agree, but if in fact we do not have free will, then even the act of leaving instructions doesnt seem to make sense, now does it. the instructions exist (if they exist), yet God knows who will obey them and who wont, and furthermore God knows that noone can choose anything other than what he has forseen them doing. therefore God knows that obedience out of free will is impossible, since free will already doesnt exist.\n\n \n God knows the future and knows that he is destined to make such instructions and in doing so will convince others to believe them (as they are destined to be convinced).\n \n Therefore God will still make the instructions as they will still convince those destined to be convinced. That and if he doesn't he is contradicting himself, changing the future and probably destroying the entire universe in the paradox.\n \n \n \nThat is your interpretation of it. Don't push that same interpretation on me as I have clearly stated that I do not agree with you on this matter.\n But look. God cannot know the future without it being set. It just doesn't make sense.\n \n \n \n\n It is not a contradiction at all. Logic states it is possible therefore I don't see the contradiction. If God doesn't know something then he doesn't know it. However if he learns it then he has always known it meaning that at no time did he not know about it. That is logical when you begin to realise what effects will happen when you take away time constraints.\n But at no point does he actually 'learn' anything. Because to learn something one must be ignorant of it beforehand by definition. As he knows about it before it happens he doesn't ever 'learn' anything, it wouldn't make logical sense for him to.\n \n As I see it at the beginning of the universe he pops into being, in all times at once and therefore knowing everything that happens at once. At no point does he actually exist in a linear sense, moving through time and 'learning' things. If he were to do this he would be constrained by time, which we have agreed he isn't.",

The problem is not doing two things at once but doing to mutually exclusive things at once, ie both knowing and not knowing something.\n\n \n Then lets make it logical. If God doesn't know something and does know something at the same time, which one takes precidence? Obviously it is the one that he knows. Therefore he no longer does not know. It is just like saying he hadn't created the world and then he had created the world at the same time. Which takes precidence?\n \n \nI don't think you can. At the moment it stands on a logical fallacy, that God can both know something and not know something, that he is both constrained by time and unconstrained by time, that the future is fixed and is not fixed. It doesn't make sense.\n\n \n Well then lets start by saying I have just shown in the above case that God either does know something or he does not, God is constrained by time even though you insist that I say he is not, and that the future is not fixed even though your convinced that it is. The only area of confusion here is caused by you forcing your beliefs onto me.\n \n Anyways, just to show that I can prove that my theory is possible let me restate something.\n \n \"God doesn't have foreknowledge.

So there it is in black and white. I'd love to see you try to disprove this.\n \n \nI don't disagree with that. What I disagree with is that God can 'learn' anything. Because to learn one must not know beforehand. As there is no lack of knowledge (or even a beforehand!) for God he cannot by definition 'learn'.\n\n \n Do you even listen to yourself? You disagree that God can learn anything? That would mean that at his creation he was unable to learn anything therefore is not all-knowing and is actually quite a retard.\n \n Also there would be a lack of knowledge about the world before it is created. God could only learn about the creation of the world if he had done so and if he had not then he couldn't learn about it.\n \n \nNot at all. In the scenario you present, where God has already experienced the future, it also must therefore be fixed.\n\n \n I didn't present any scenario at all so I'm not even sure what you are talking about here. I made a statement that is either true or false and it has nothing at all to do with God already experiencing the future or not. Now let me restate it so that you can have a second chance at answering it. Read it carefully and provide me with the answer that either yes you think my statement is right or no it is not and provide a reason for it.\n \n \"The future is only unchangeable assuming that it can be predicted. If it is not predictable by something that is all knowing then it is not unchangeable. Again, try to disprove this if you wish.\"\n \n \nAgain, I'm not.

If not then you are stating that without a doubt that God is able to predict the future.\n \n \nActually no. That wasn't a double negative on your part, it was a typo on my part. I meant to say 'You said that we all knew free will was likely to exist'. I don't know that, neither do others who have contributed. Therefore we don't 'all' know that. But this is just a petty point.\n\n \n A petty point that is required in your case more than it is in mine. Assuming free will is suggested to exist and we can show no way for it to exist then that would be a blow to the idea that the Christian God exists. It makes no difference to my case at all but plays a key role in yours if the outcome favors you so I don't know why you down play it.\n \n \nI agree. But:\n\n \n So you do agree than if God cannot predict the future that free will can exist? Wow, progress! Now you see why I am insisting that you are saying that God can predict the future.\n \n \nNow this sound like the future can be known to me.

If he knows what is going to happen Tuesday on Monday that means the future is very much set. It doesn't matter how he knows this.\n\n \n You are incorrect here as I showed the future was not set at all before it occurred. It was the occurrance of it that gave God the knowledge about it and therefore made it possible for him to know about it before it occurred.\n \n \nBut these are not the same things. He can remember/have knowledge of something but he cannot 'learn' something as that would require him to be ignorant of it beforehand.\n\n \n Learn: To gain knowledge or information of.\n \n So to be able to remember something or have knowledge of something you have to gain the knowledge of it first. Isn't that logical to you?\n \n \nNo, it is not 'predicting' the future, it is experiencing it as he has already existed through it.\n\n \n predicting - to tell in advance. Experience occurs real time. If the future is set in stone then it was set in stone as soon as the world was created. Experience did not occur until things were put into motion up until the end of the world. Therefore if you want to be logical it would have to be true that the knowledge of the future would occur before the experience could.",

   "AMD, it is not contradicting for 2 things to occur at the same time. its only a contradiction when something is and is not at the same time. the world cannot exists and at the same time not exist. this is where contradiction comes in\n\n \n I can assure you that God both was and was not creating the world at the same time. God is looking down at you and is not looking down on you right now. God is casting Satan down to hell and has Satan in heaven at the same time. Are you sure these are not contradictions?\n \n As I stated to Phunting we can use logic to decide which on takes precidence. For instance if God knows something then it is impossible that he does not know it. However when it comes to actions, the truth is that if you are not constrained by time then you are absolutely doing two contradicting things at the same time. So absolutely God is looking down on you right now however since he does all things at the same time that means that he is in 2100 right now not looking down on you and perhaps even having a conversation with you in heaven. So much for not being contradicting. God looking down on you, not looking down on you, welcoming you into heaven, and having a friendly conversation with you all at the same time. That is the fact about not being constrained by time. It can all occur at once and there is no contradiction at all.\n \n \nlets not use the word 'predict' but rather 'foresee'. relative to our time and existence, God knows what will happen before it happens in our time. therefore he can foresee our future. if this is the case then the future is already set in stone, since God can only foresee what is actually truly going to happen, and since he has foreseen, there is nothing that can be done to alter the way our future will unfold. does this make sense?\n\n \n Again I tell you to take the case of God not being able to see the future and God not being constrained by time. Now based on this alone tell me true or false, God knows what tomorrow holds? It had better be false because we haven't given him that ability. Now true or false, after tomorrow happens God will have known about it since the beginning of time? It had better be true because God is not constrained by time. So true or false, did we just show free will and God knowing the future at the same time? Absolutely we did. It means that tomorrow doesn't exist yet but because of a condition of being unconstrained by time God will know about it. That means no information about the future is set in stone and that God only knows about it once it is the past and we all agree the past can be set in stone.\n \n \nif God is in tuesday while we are still in monday, then God has seen our future. If he exists in tuesday before our time reaches tueday, then he has seen the events of tuesday before we would, which is foreseeing our future\n\n \n Lets put it another way. If we found out that God cannot see what tomorrow brings but is able to know about the present time long before it actually occurs then would you have any trouble accepting that free will exists?\n \n \nif God is already in our tomorrow before we are, then he knows what we will do tomorrow before we do. this means that our future has been foreseen by God\n\n \n He is not actually in our tomorrow before we are though. There is an apparent loop hole in being unconstrained by time that would allow him to know abut tomorrow before today is finished and I have explained why that is. Now here is that loop hole:\n \n Today is done therefore God knows all of todays events since the beginning of time. Therefore this means that our entire past has been made predictable but only after it has already happened.\n \n So here is what the question to you becomes. If God did not know what today was going to be before it happened but then when it completed it became something that he knew about since the beginning of time, does that mean today was set in stone?\n \n I would say it absolutely does not. Him knowing about what today was going to be since the beginning of time is an occurrance of him being unconstrained by time and not an occurrance of the future being set in stone.",

   "When did I even say he had to travel through time?\nYou are constantly saying he does not know something and then learns it. That is being constrained by time. If he was not constrained by time then he would at no point not know something.\n \n \n \nTherefore he no longer does not know.\nThere, you did it again. If he is unconstrained by time there is no change, he cannot not know something at one point and know it later. For God there is no later.\n \n \n \nThen lets make it logical. If God doesn't know something and does know something at the same time, which one takes precidence? Obviously it is the one that he knows. It is just like saying he hadn't created the world and then he had created the world at the same time. Which takes precidence?\nFine. So that means that he always has known something, so at no point does he ever not know something so the future is therefore most defiantly fixed.\n \n \n \nGod is constrained by time even though you insist that I say he is not,\nDid you mean that the other way around?\n \n \n \nand that the future is not fixed even though your convinced that it is.\n But surely if there is a definite future that will defiantly happen (and you agree that there is as god has experienced it already) then wouldn't you say that that future is fixed?\n \n \n \nThe only area of confusion here is caused by you forcing your beliefs onto me.\n I don't care if you believe what I believe or not, as long as your beliefs actually make sense. At the moment they don't.\n \n \n \nAnyways, just to show that I can prove that my theory is possible let me restate something.\n \n \"God doesn't have foreknowledge. He doesn't know what I'll do next.\n \n I write this post to you. God sees this occur.\n \n God not being constrained by time will therefore know this event since the beginning of time.\n \n Therefore God knew I would do this before I had done it.\n \n Now using your theory that God is unconstrained by time and that God has no foreknowledge, ie ability to predict future, show me how I am wrong here.\"\nPlease see Unkerpaulie's post, it quite clearly shows how this post made no sense.\n \n \n \nIt is entirely possible that we can do things before God knows what they will be\nCan you not see that this would mean God is subject to time?\n \n \n \nSo there it is in black and white. I'd love to see you try to disprove this.\nI have. And So has Unkerpaulie. Several times now. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nDo you even listen to yourself? You disagree that God can learn anything?\nYes. To learn something he must have not known it in the first place. As he knows everything in the first place then he cannot learn anything new because there is nothing new to learn. That is not saying he's a retard.\n \n \n \nI didn't present any scenario at all so I'm not even sure what you are talking about here.\nOk, poor wording. I meant in you arguement. But still my reply stands. The future is unchangeable if it has already been experienced by God. Try to disprove this if you wish. \n \n Why do you say that the future is set if you call it 'predicting' but not set if you call it 'experiencing'? In the end it all boils down to the same thing.\n \n \n \nSo you do agree than if God cannot predict the future that free will can exist? Wow, progress! Now you see why I am insisting that you are saying that God can predict the future.\nThis is absolutely no change from what I have always said! Of course free will is possible if the future isn't set. But just by not calling it 'predicting' you are claiming the future isn't set.\n \n \n \nBut the future being known is not the same as the future being predicted.\nWhy not?\n \n \n \nYou are incorrect here as I showed the future was not set at all before it occurred.\n So once again that means that God must be constrained by time. As he didn't experience it till it occurs.\n \n I'm sorry to have to say this, but I see little point in this discussion continuing. Your argument makes no logical sense, I can see this, Unkerpaulie can see this, I'm sure most people reading this thread can see this. Yet for some reason you refuse to. Until you admit that you are not making a coherent logical argument this thread is doomed to go on indefinitely, but not actually go anywhere.

   "look at your own statement. you start off by saying God has no foreknowledge, meaning he doesnt know what you would do before you do it (1). then you conclude that God knew what you would do before you did it (2). I think your efforts of trying to show that God has foreknowledge and no foreknowledge are being wasted. I dont even have to show you where you are wrong here, you did it yourself\n\n \n Actually you are just not giving any consideration to what I've actually said.\n \n \"God doesn't have foreknowledge. He doesn't know what I'll do next.\"\n \n So far I'm sure your fine with this whole idea. You are gleeful to see that free will is preserved and that the future is not set in stone.\n \n \"I write this post to you. God sees this occur.\"\n \n Still no problem. God seen something happen out of free will and now he knows about it. So what?\n \n \"God not being constrained by time will therefore know this event since the beginning of time.\"\n \n And the walls come crashing down. The future is now predictable even though it was not until the event was already complete. You shake your fists in rage as you believe that free will has suddenly disappeared. But I ask you, where exactly did the free will you just had go? You obviously had free will only a matter of seconds ago but now it is gone because of this loop hole in being unconstrained by time?\n \n \"Therefore God knew I would do this before I had done it.\"\n \n Now lets go back to the beginning. God has no foreknowledge. Now did he have foreknowledge at all? Absoultely not. He had no idea what was going to happen until it did. So I kept to that. However he ends up knowing about what I was going to do long before I did it. However this no longer matters as the action is already completed. The future was not set in stone until it had become the past. So yes now that it is done I could care less that it is predictable and that is the way you should feel as well. Free will gets preserved and God can see the so-called \"future\". For instance he can now know that I was going to write this post to you even when it was 1990 but that doesn't at all interfere with my free will because the event has already taken place.\n \n \n In being in this debate for over a week now I am starting to find humor in the fact that you think free will disappears just because God can know the future. I start a scenario where there is free will and God doesn't know the future. Yet as soon as God does know the future, which is inevitable considering that he is unconstrained by time, free will suddenly disappears. No one can explain where it went but it is gone and that is that. Don't fall into this trap. As long as free will exists at one time it cannot simply disappear for any reason. That is why my theory works. It deals with how free will is not affected by the unconstrained by time loophole.",

   "You are constantly saying he does not know something and then learns it. That is being constrained by time. If he was not constrained by time then he would at no point not know something.\n\n \n I am not stating that at all. What I am stating is that regardless of time constraints if events do occur they can result in learning different things. If God hadn't created the earth things that he knows now would be different and that is not affected by being constrained or unconstrained by time. They flat out would be different. How you find the will to debate this glaringly obvious fact is beyond me.\n \n \nThere, you did it again. If he is unconstrained by time there is no change, he cannot not know something at one point and know it later. For God there is no later.\n\n \n You are the one who demands that things make logical sense. But here I'll just let you debate it out with yourself so I don't have to walk you through it.\n \n Did God know about the end of time first or did he create the universe first? If he did both at the same time did one result in the other occurring? How is it possible that one led to the other occurring if he is not constrained by time and both have to happen at once?\n \n \nFine. So that means that he always has known something, so at no point does he ever not know something so the future is therefore most defiantly fixed.\n\n \n I'll prove this wrong right now. You agree it is possible for him to know something and not know something at the same time but the know something takes precidence. Therefore it is entirely possible for him not to know the future until it has occurred and therefore when all is set and done he will have known the future since the beginning of time. This covers every aspect of this debate. Free will is preserved and God has always known the future.\n \n \nDid you mean that the other way around?\n\n \n Yes I did.\n \n \nBut surely if there is a definite future that will defiantly happen (and you agree that there is as god has experienced it already) then wouldn't you say that that future is fixed?\n\n \n But in the example I laid out I specifically stated that the future was not fixed. Sure I also stated that once an event had occurred then God knew about it since the beginning of time but how does that affect us at all? If something is already completed and wasn't predictable until it occurred then how does that make the future fixed?\n \n \n I don't care if you believe what I believe or not, as long as your beliefs actually make sense. At the moment they don't.\n\n \n The past is the only thing that I am suggesting is fixed.\n \n \nPlease see Unkerpaulie's post, it quite clearly shows how this post made no sense.\n\n \n I've seen his post and responded to it.\n \n \nCan you not see that this would mean God is subject to time?\n\n \n Actually as I suggested before certain events will affect Gods knowledge regardless as to whether he is constrained by time or not. If the US was never formed God would know something different than he does now wouldn't you agree.\n \n \nI have. And So has Unkerpaulie. Several times now. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n I'll simplify this down as to avoid confusion. I want you to try and disprove the core of my debate which I will post here.\n \n God does not know what you will do next meaning free will is intact. God is unconstrained by time. Once you have completed your action it has become predictable to God since the beginning of time. This maintains both free will and explains how God can know the so-called future.\n \n I state it as the so-called future because sure God can now predict what you will do today years before you do it but it has actually already occurred. Also note that all-knowing and unconstrained by time result in the same thing occurring. You can take away either one and you will still get the same result.\n \n \nYes. To learn something he must have not known it in the first place. As he knows everything in the first place then he cannot learn anything new because there is nothing new to learn. That is not saying he's a retard.\n\n \n How did he learn anything in the first place then? Anyways there cannot be any debating that even if God was to learn something new right now he would still be learning it at the same time he learned he existed. Sure we can logically depict what he probably learned first and second but to him he just learned it all at once.\n \n \nOk, poor wording. I meant in you arguement. But still my reply stands. The future is unchangeable if it has already been experienced by God. Try to disprove this if you wish. \n\n \n I do wish to as a matter of fact. Today was the future when it was yesterday. Part of today is now predictable meaning it was known about yesterday. Still that gives us no indication that today is predictable at this point meaning free will can exist along side a predictable so-called future.\n \n \nWhy do you say that the future is set if you call it 'predicting' but not set if you call it 'experiencing'? In the end it all boils down to the same thing.\n\n \n Experiencing means it has already occurred. If God is learning through experience that means he is allowing people to live through free will. Predicting would indicate we are all on set paths and free will doesn't exist. It doesn't boil down to the same thing.\n \n \nThis is absolutely no change from what I have always said! Of course free will is possible if the future isn't set. But just by not calling it 'predicting' you are claiming the future isn't set.\n\n \n If the future is set then God has to be able to predict it. There is just no way around that. You are suggesting the future can also be set through experience and that is false. If experience occurs that means God is not actually in the future but rather living in the present. You cannot experience something that has yet to happen.\n \n \nWhy not?\n\n \n Because God can know about some of todays events even years ago since they have already occurred. So yes he technically would know the future in that case but he isn't actually able to predict what will happen next until it does in which case it becomes predictable throughout all of time. That is far different from predicting which requires that even things that have not occurred be predictable throughout all of time.\n \n \nSo once again that means that God must be constrained by time. As he didn't experience it till it occurs.\n\n \n That is not at all what I'm saying. God doesn't wait for tomorrow to occur as it is impossible. However tomorrows events will change what God knows about as I'm sure you will agree. God didn't know about Jesus's death until he died correct? So does that mean God was constrained by time? Not at all. His mind was just reacting to events that occurred and new information made available which of course was all processed at the same time that he was first created.\n \n \nI'm sorry to have to say this, but I see little point in this discussion continuing. Your argument makes no logical sense, I can see this, Unkerpaulie can see this, I'm sure most people reading this thread can see this. Yet for some reason you refuse to. Until you admit that you are not making a coherent logical argument this thread is doomed to go on indefinitely, but not actually go anywhere. Sorry mate, but there's just nothing left to say here until you start using logic.\n\n \n Well I'm sorry to see that you have decided to give up on me even though five hours ago you said you would not. But do what you will. I have a much better understanding of my point of view even if you do not accept that I am on the right track. I consider myself to be a deeper thinker than most and perhaps I am right. I see the facts plain as day and really haven't heard a whole lot of arguments that stand up to them. So I guess we have both decided on what we will believe at least as far as this debate goes. I thank you for your time and hope to engage in debates with you again in the future :)",

God still had as much information last Friday (total information about today) as he does today. Before today occurred he still has the same amount of information today as he did last Friday. The two will always be equal.\n \n I think I'm answering your question correctly anyways. emoticon_wow \n\n statements 1 and 2 obvoiusly contradict each other, and both cannot be true at the same time. If God knew something ever since time began (even the events of today) then he would have known it last week Friday. even being unconstrained by time, the beginning of time still only occurs once. under your theory the beginning of time (as well as last week Friday) is constantly being changed to accomodate new information about our present. to me this isnt logical. its as though the past continues to change\n \n what value is this information to God, seeing that even though He can go back to the past and review information as far forward as the present, but He cannot see ahead of the present? If God can only see the future when it has already occured, then how does this help us? furthermore, from what you say, God is still constrained by time, in that He is limited by our present. even though He has the liberty of going back to the beginning of time and being able to predict the events of today since 1904, He still has no foreknowledge of the future where it really matters, i.e., our future.\n \n \nIt implies that God always knows everything that is possible to know. At no time does he know less than that. This doesn't prevent him from learning more either as events occur ie the creation of time/earth/man\n \n It isn't possible for him to know what will happen tomorrow because there is nothing to know about it. It is just like asking if he knew what would happen today before he created time. There is just nothing to know about it.\n\n this I can agree with\n \n I am stating that God will learn more after the event \"tomorrow\" occurs. Until then there is just nothing to know about it.[/quote]\n this I can agree with, but this shows that God is constrained by time, even if it is a partial constraint. when people say 'unconstrained by time', they imply that God can fast-forward/skip scenes and view what will happen indefinitely ahead of our real time. \n \n I contend that the future doesnt exist, therefore even if God knows everything there is, and knows not what is not, He still knows everything, and therefore is still omniscient. see? we agree again!\n \n \nGod isn't technically waiting for anything. The reason that I believe he cannot have this information right now is because even things that are not constrained by time will have to linearlly do some thing. An example I've used a few times now is the creation of the earth followed by gaining knowledge about it. It doesn't require time in order for one things to occur because of another thing.\n\n true, things that are conditional, meaning, if x is true, then y is true, not that x must occur before y. I see your point here.\n \n however, in this particular case, the condition is 'if tomorrow occurs, God will know about tomorrow'. God cannot know what occurs tomorrow until tomorrow occurs, which means that God must wait for tomorrow to occur, then He will know what events happen tomorrow. this can be considered being constrained by time",

Clearly one had to occur in order for the other to be possible meaning at the beginning of time the first thing know would probably simply be his existance. The knowledge bank at the beginning of time was added to after that with the creation of the universe, man, and the plights of man. It has been an evolving thing for some time now. It didn't just suddenly become this because of our time constraints. I don't see how it cannot be an evolving thing.\n \n \nwhat value is this information to God, seeing that even though He can go back to the past and review information as far forward as the present, but He cannot see ahead of the present? If God can only see the future when it has already occured, then how does this help us? furthermore, from what you say, God is still constrained by time, in that He is limited by our present. even though He has the liberty of going back to the beginning of time and being able to predict the events of today since 1904, He still has no foreknowledge of the future where it really matters, i.e., our future.\n\n \n How does it help us? It gives us our free will obviously.\n \n He is not limited by the present. He is limited by what can be known and what cannot be known. He has shown repeatedly both in heaven where time doesn't exist and on earth where time does exist that he doesn't know everything before it occurs. The rebellion in heaven is a good example of this and so are the failed prophecies in the Bible. He is clearly limited in predicting the future both with and without time constraints. At least that is what I gather from it all.\n \n Why does it really matter what our future is to God? He has a master plan that he is TRYING to enact. What trying would there be if it was all predictable? There is every indication that God is trying his best to generate a certain outcome but he is not sure if it will happen or not. This doesn't make things easy on him but I don't think it would be worth it for him either if it was easy. This brings us to the question of why God even exists. In human terms it would seem a lot more interesting to be God if things were at least challenging instead of consistantly predictable.\n \n \nthis I can agree with, but this shows that God is constrained by time, even if it is a partial constraint. when people say 'unconstrained by time', they imply that God can fast-forward/skip scenes and view what will happen indefinitely ahead of our real time. \n\n \n I think it is fair to say that there is a partial constraint on God in that he cannot view the end of time until it has happened. The constraint is of course removed at that point.\n \n \nI contend that the future doesnt exist, therefore even if God knows everything there is, and knows not what is not, He still knows everything, and therefore is still omniscient. see? we agree again!\n\n \n Yep I think our ideas are starting to mesh.\n \n \nhowever, in this particular case, the condition is 'if tomorrow occurs, God will know about tomorrow'. God cannot know what occurs tomorrow until tomorrow occurs, which means that God must wait for tomorrow to occur, then He will know what events happen tomorrow. this can be considered being constrained by time\n\n \n If God has known about today since the beginning of time is there any evidence showing that he had to wait for today to occur? Once tomorrow is complete there will again be no reason to believe that he had to wait for anything to occur in order to know what tomorrow brings. At this moment we debate that he is waiting but clearly he is not as will be proven tomorrow. So based on this I would say he does not have to wait.\n \n I'm not sure how best to account for how he doesn't know what will happen tomorrow until it has occurred but logically it has to be true that he isn't waiting for it to happen.",

   "all in all, we seem to agree that God is ultimately constrained by time and doesnt know the future before it happens.\n \n I believe that God still has a 'schedule', so to speak, where if he says something will happen at a time in the future, it will happen. he can see to it that something happens, but He wont force the person to do it, maybe just ask them to. for example, even though Saul (Paul) was struck down with blindness by God himself, that didnt stop Paul from choosing to do as he wanted and not preach. God would have simply asked someone else. eventually someone would have chosen to be obedient, but God wouldnt know a man's choice before he makes it, otherwise it simply wouldnt be free will",
