   "So now online predators can lure kids through their XBoxes? Sick! These perverts will stop at no medium to get to kids. Has anyone heard about this yet? emoticon_angry \n \n \n http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/cityregion/s_451364.html\n \n Protection from predators\n \n By Chuck Biedka\n Tribune-Review News Service\n Sunday, May 7, 2006\n \n In the realm of people who use the Internet to prey on children, there is a new tool: the Xbox 360.\n \n Cyber predators wasted no time figuring out that the wildly popular game system can put them in contact with youngsters.\n \n A feature on Microsoft Xbox 360 game systems allows voice communication for direct, real-time contact between players -- in addition to the instant messaging or chat rooms used by other games.\n \n Child advocates fear direct contact might make the games a new hunting ground for computer-savy predators.\n \n \"Predators used to go to playgrounds where they would hang around swing sets and monkey bars. Now we have a virtual playground. Unfortunately, it's just as easy, or easier, for predators to go online and look for kids,\" said FBI Special Agent William Shore, who directs Pittsburgh's computer crimes task force.\n \n His colleague, Special Agent Marc S. Southland, said the misuse of advanced Xbox and similar game systems by predators is not widespread in this area, but it happens. Parents need to know, he said.\n \n Most of the recent media attention about cyber predators has focused on sites such as MySpace.com, which many teens use to make personal profiles. In contrast, the Xbox phenomenon is not yet on the public radar, said John Shehan, who directs the Cybertipline for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n \n \"There are relatively few of these cases, but, unfortunately, we're hearing about them,\" Shehan said.\n \n A cyber predator used an electronic game system to try to lure a Harrison youngster. Investigators from the computer crimes task force said inappropriate messages showed up when the youth was using a friend's Xbox game last month. The messages urged the user to meet with the sender. The friend's mother saw the messages and told the youth's mother, who contacted the authorities.\n \n Authorities declined to reveal specific information as the investigation continues.\n \n Pittsburgh Police Detective Michael Overholt said a city youth appeared to be a target of cyber luring last year through a gaming system. The youth's mother stepped in but declined to prosecute.\n \n At Butler, state police Cpl. John Stepansky said a New York man tried to get a Butler youth to meet him, but the child's parent intervened.\n \n Predators can use information about a child obtained online or from telephone conversations to attempt abductions, said another state trooper, who trains local police to do cyber investigations.\n \n \"Children may think that they are chatting with someone their own age and sex, but they may not be,\" Trooper Rob Erdley said.\n \n The state Attorney General's Office is aware that the Xbox and online games can be a conduit between adults and kids, said spokesman Nils Hagen-Frederickson.\n \n \"The people out there stalking children on the Internet are hunting, and they're very good at stalking their prey,\" he said.\n \n A spokeswoman for Microsoft, which manufactures the Xbox 360, would not speak about the potential predator problem, but in an e-mail said, \"providing a safe, secure environment for all consumers has been a part of the Xbox story from the beginning.\"\n \n Microsoft has \"led the effort to build in safety measures\" that \"enable parents to choose the right playing and viewing settings for their family,\" said the spokeswoman, who did not want to be named.\n \n The Xbox 360 game console has \"enhanced family settings,\" she said.\n \n Parents also should check the communications of older children who use laptop computers away from home, said U.S. Postal Inspector Joe Bellissimo.\n \n Libraries and other public places also have computers, said Detective Lynn Havelka, an investigator for the Allegheny County District Attorney's Office.\n \n \"The bottom line is that parents should monitor what games their kids play, including online games, just as they should monitor how they spend time on the Internet and other forms of media generally,\" said Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Entertainment Software Association.\n \n One researcher said he believes the threat potential in online games is limited at best.\n \n \"I certainly have seen some reports, but I certainly wouldn't convey that games are the most dangerous high-risk environments,\" said David Finkelhor, of the Crimes against Children Research Center at University of New Hampshire in Durham.\n \n \"I wouldn't say it's more dangerous than a local park or bowling alley or any other place where a child can encounter an adult,\" Finkelhor said.\n \n Finklehor's groundbreaking 2001 national survey of children revealed that almost one in five of young Internet users had received a unwanted sexual solicitation within the past year.\n \n \"This is not the first time that I've heard Xbox Live being used,\" said David Delmonico, an associate professor of counselor education at Duquesne University.\n \n Delmonico said parents must remember they are parents.\n \n \"You don't need to know much about the technology,\" he said. \"Your existing parenting skills allow you to show the kids ways to stay safe.\"",

   "You've gotta be pretty stupid to agree to meet someone you meet online. I'm pretty sure most people here aren't predators, because it would be way too much work to post a lot when there are much easier ways, but I wouldn't take any chances. I don't even give out much personal info either. Most can probably guess my name's Zach and I've said I'm from Maryland, but that's about it. There's no reason, especially playing video games, to give out any personal information or to agree to meet with someone when they don't know the true idenntiity. I know one day while playing Starcraft online a couple years ago someone said they were coming to Maryland and asked where I lived and said we should meet. I basically said you're not getting any more information and I'm not agreeing to meet you. Even if you are who you say you are, I see no reason to meet in person, we can continue to play the game online together, but there's no need for personal information in an online game, on the computer or XBOX.",

They were naive when predators started using MySpace as their playground to stalk (exapmle Taylor Behl, a college student who gave too much info and was murdered) and i think if we get ahead of the game with Xbox being a possibility for these perverts that we can keep kids safe. Arm kids with resources such as Cybertipline so they know where to report these sickos, whether they are approached online or Xbox and the predators will learn that their mediums to harm kids are decreasing.",

It's like an invitation for people to look you up and see info about you. Don't most of your friends know you? I can see doing an anonymous one or one with bad info. But really putting a ton of personal info in the public on a site notorious for child predators using to attack people??? People need to use their brains a little more while on the internet.",

   "Zachvac, I agree with everything you said. I think MySpace is a great social network that has been misused by many sickos. I am on a social network similar to MySpace and i have kept in touch with people that i probably wouldnt have if it had not been for this site. I think while it has been abused, MySpace has partnered up with NCMEC and Cybertipline to make it a safer network for teens. Hopefully things will improve. \n \n http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB114463105359921424-2tG12tTj91Y1i1TKhO19OLZr6TQ_20060417.html",
