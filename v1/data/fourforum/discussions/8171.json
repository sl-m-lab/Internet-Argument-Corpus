   "Okruashvili is instigating Saakashvili to begin military operations against Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the nearest future because he sees the weakness of president's position. Look, his main aim is not victory or annexation of autonomies, Okruashvili doesn't count with it, but he is at power seizure as a result of collapse, which will be provoked by military conflict. The Minister of Defence convinced Saakashvili that it will be better to use 'other' forces along with front-line forces and police in military operations against autonomies. And Saakashvili agreed because of in case of using non-state military units he could talk that Georgians have minimum losses. But Georgian troops (Special Forces prepared by US instructors) Okruashvili concentrated near Tbilisi and other cities. Some 'other' forces Okruashvili is going to use are 'White Legion', 'Mkhedrioni' and 'Veris Sadzmo'. Moreover Georgian officials enlisted some illegal armed forces (Turks Meshetins and Chechens of course) beyond the bounds of Georgia. Okruashvili has prepared himself for the coup quite well.",
