   "OK, so I'm currently looking into many colleges. I'm looking for something strong in math and computer science, and with a division II or III baseball program that I could play in. Now one that fit that criteria is Augustana College in Illinois. Now I don't know much about it, but when my mom looked at the profile she literally just crossed it off her list (assuming that I would want to as well). Why? Because collegeboard.com shows under type of school: Evangelical Lutheran Church In America along with the other statistics. My question is, how big of a difference will it make whether a religion funds the school or not? I assume people aren't required to take religious classes, but how far of an extent would religion play into my education should I go to a school like that? Thanks.",

Thanks.\n\n I would assume that the only true religious connection between a college and religion is the backing. I don't really know of any other conncection. But I go to a regular University. And for what it's worth, KU's baseball season was good this year and they got to go to Hawaii to play one of the last games. But being a KU student myself, I'm partial to it. I don't really know much about the computer and math though, I took care of all that before going up there.\n \n Good luck finding a college.",

   "From my understanding, a big difference between a religious/private school and a secular/public school is going to be the price tag. Since public universities receive funds from the state, their tuition rates are much lower. Private schools have higher tuition rates, but generally there are many more scholarships available that offset the price making it more comparable to a public school.\n \n There is also probably going to be subtle differences in housing arrangements, activities, the surrounding community, & expectations of students (which may include religion classes).\n \n Visit, visit, visit!

She's going to be a grad student and tuition is over 34K. She only received 1/3 of the tuition in grad assistantships. I have no idea why on Earth someone would pay so much.

Isn't that 6 times as much? Just kidding, I get what you mean, but yeah. My math teacher told me a story about a kid who got accepted to I believe a pretty prestigeous college somewhere in Chicago, but he'd have to supply the whole tuition and it would be very hard on his family, or he could go to Maryland, which also had the programs he wanted, for FREE. He got a full ride there. The math teacher said \"take the money\". From what I've heard, most undergrad programs are the same generally, as long as they have the programs you want. The only problem is that I'm looking to play baseball, and most state schools such as Maryland are Division I. And while I'm decent, there's no way I'm going to make it as a 5'11\", 135 pound kid who hits for singles and can't throw 90 MPH. So I have to make a choice. Baseball team as a small Division II or III school and start on the real team? Or go to a big Division I school, and just play on the club or intramural team.\n \n \n\n OSU was just too big with way too many students.

I mean, if you aren't looking to be a pro ball player and just get experience playing then that makes sense to me. But then again, I have a degree in music. :)\n \n You can always transfer, too.

Thanks.\nFormer Lutheran here, and I think Lutherans are kind of cool if they're not Missouri Synod or Wisconsin something or other. Visit the campus. Find out if you have to attend chapel. Talk to students. Lutherans tend to like to quaff a bit of beer. Check the sobriety level.",
