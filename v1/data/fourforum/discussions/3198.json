   "FYI\n \n Iraq war illegal, says Annan\n United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan says the United States decision to invade Iraq in March 2003 was \"illegal\". \n Australia was a key supporter of the war on Iraq and sent troops to joined the United States-led invasion last year. \n Mr Annan's comments are likely to reignite debate over whether US President George W Bush, Prime Minister John Howard and British Prime Minister Tony Blair acted within the bounds of international law by failing to get a final UN Security Council resolution on Iraq. \n Speaking in an interview with BBC World Service radio, Mr Annan says the UN Security Council should have issued a second resolution, if a US-led invasion of Iraq was to be allowed.\n \"I'm one of those who believe that there should have been a second resolution,\" he said.\n \"Yes, if you wish. I've indicated that it was not in conformity with the UN Charter from our point of view, and from the Charter point of view it was illegal.\"\n The UN Charter is one of the cornerstones of international law. \n Mr Annan says that given the current level of violence and unrest, it is unlikely that Iraq would be able to hold credible elections as planned in January 2005. \n \"I think there have been lessons for the US and lessons for the UN and other member states,\" he said.\n \"I think that, in the end, everybody's concluded that it is best to work together with our allies and through the UN to deal with some of these issues. \n \"I hope we do not see another Iraq-type operation for a long time...without UN approval and much broader support from the international community.\" \n The council had adopted a number of resolutions over the years to compel Saddam Hussein to abandon the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. \n The final resolution was adopted in November 2002, when UN inspectors re-entered Iraq, warning the Iraqi regime of \"serious consequences\" if it was found to be in material breach of the earlier resolutions. \n Mr Annan says the decision on whether to act on Iraq should have been made by the UN.\n \"It was up to the Security Council to approve or determine what those consequences should be,\" he said.\n Mr Annan told a news conference in The Hague, Netherlands, shortly before the invasion that if the United States took military action without Security Council approval \"it would not be in conformity with the Charter\".\n The United States and Britain withdrew a draft resolution in the council in mid-March after it was clear there were not enough votes. \n France had threatened to veto the draft if UN inspectors were not given more time to account for Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. \n -- AFP/Reuters\n http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200409/s1200210.htm",

Teh cease fire was with the UN, not the US, and we had no right to jump back into Iraq without UN support. What we did was illegal, there is really no question of that. Those who are using the cease fire argument seem to be stuck in this delusional plane where the US makes all the rules (sorry broker....usually you are very clear headed, on this one you are 180 degrees off) and has the right to enforce those rules at will. this is not the way the owrld works, though the current batch of crusaders seems to be trying to go this direction (it is not going well).",

   "Well, a couple of points to digest about Chemical and Biological weapons in Iraq:\n \n Why the big flap over them? they were used against coalition forces in the first Gulf War (and before you ask, a little bird told me this emoticon_xangel ). The reason we didn't hear about it directly was to save face with regards to certain statements made by certain western leaders (recall Bush Snr. threat of nuclear retaliation before Desert Storm?).\n \n Although it will probably be never proven, Iraq did have in its possession operable chemical and biological agents, abeit in small quantities. The fact is though such materials could fit inside the average suitcase, and well, Iraq has a land area 437,072 square kilometers- well I'm sure you see the issue there.\n \n The Iraqi regime did continue to maintain a strong interest in such technologies. Of even greater concern was the renewed interest in 2000 in the establishment of a civil nuclear programme (yes, we all know where that could lead......). There was a real nuclear strategic threat that Iraq posed in the Middle East before the current military action began.\n \n \n The great irony is that Iraq, under the Baathist regime and particularly Saddam Hussein was a serious nuclear threat to regional stability. I'm not saying that to justify the war one way or another but more as a statement of fact, or that war was the only way to deal with the problem- it was one of a number of solutions.\n \n My disapproval with the build up to the current war is with the way the USA and UK were unable to articulate this issue to their populations and instead got hung up on all sorts of other things, like the \"45 minute\" claim which did not help the situation, and have since had serious doubt cast on their meaning and reliability.",

   "Almost everybody knows this is wrong. He had WMD. We don't know what happened to them.\n\n we know that they are nowhere to be found, obviously not availble for saddam's use. i guess he destroyed them. you are still under the belief that they are hidden.\n \n \nYes. It was possible for Saddam to attack us or our here or abroad by smuggling WMD into the country or back setting them off at our embassies anywhere in the world. The possibilities are endless.\n\n these wmds dont exist jim. give it up\n \n \nDo you believe everything you see or just the things that back up your argument? I repeat, you do not know what is being done in pursuit of Osama.\n\n jim, i dont know about you, but if youre comfortable with the fact that nothing is being reported about our efforts to pursue bin laden, then good for you. i am very disturbed, outraged even, by the fact that nothing is being reported. there is no information about funds, man power or plans to pursue bin laden. in fact, bush completely skirted the issue last night. believe me, if something was being done, bush would have surely said so. look how many times he mentioned or efforts in north korea and that libya is complying. \n \n face it, bin laden is not being pursued",
