I think in other cases genuine believers with a weakness for hating others find a convenient outlet in gay people.",

   "Whilst your thoughts have a ring of truth about them the figures that were posted by one member (Iangb/Penfold?) from the Gay Police assoc. stating that the majority of violent homophobic incidents were related to the perpetrators religious beliefs would appear to contradict the hypothesis.\n If only 7% of the population are church-goers you might expect a similar proportion of incidents if homophobia is not related to religion, (assuming church-goers have the stronger beliefs, access to scripture/publications, subject to possibly homophobic sermons etc.) One thing that does occur to me is a possible ethnic discrepancy in the incidents as the Afro-Carribean community are noted as having strong views on the subject.",

   "But how is motivation by religious belief defined? Is that simply the justification given to police? I think it would also vary depending on the sort of incident. Organised homophobia, harrassment of pride marches etc. I agree is more likely to be through religious organisations, but I suspect that low level \"casual\" homophobia that won't get reported to the police is likely to come from a broader swathe of the population. There is also the fact that the idea of separation and difference, and a feeling of superiority over others, can be part of the attraction of fundamentalist forms of Christianity, and hence they attract people who are already pre-disposed to homophobia.",

Discrimination against gay people in the workplace is also unlawful and should be reported to employers, who have a duty of care to prevent it.
