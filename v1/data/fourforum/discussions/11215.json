   "They have a building in Louisville KY.\n I think my mother married her 3rd husband (and last) there about 15 years ago. Marriage lasted a month.\n She's some odd blend of Catholic, Pagan and what ever catches her fancy.\n I guess she's a professional. I seldom talk to her anymore.\n I think she went there for marriage as she's technically excommunicated from the RCC for divorce...and the marriage would have been 'adultry'.\n \n Basically, it's a generic 'religion' that seems to be a catch-all thingy like a 12 step program is. Deistic and anyone can come.\n Pretty loose on the dogma and beliefs.\n \n It's quite obvious it would appeal to anyone who thinks they're too good for what ever religions are out there, the spiritual-but-not-religious people you hear about, those who are too timid to break away from nonsensical religions fully or those who simply believe 'something is out there' but they don't know what but don't want to be part of a fringe group like New Agers or a generic Non-denominationalism.\n \n Sounds like the article is bitching about a problem in his 'faith' and not really knowing the cause.\n Working class people have a simple mindset. They do what they're told. Organized religions that they are born into are typically good enough for them to begin with. They are the type of people who don't like change often...especially if they aren't having their noses rubbed into a problem.\n If it ain't broke, it don't need fixin' would be their mantra.\n \n A snobbish, loose-organized religion offers them nothing that something with better support and more members can't.\n And working class don't do snobbish. They also seldom do liberal. \n \n The UU's also offer nothing to the young that another religion can't. And young people would tend to the exotic or snazzy in seeking something themselves. So, easter mysticism, a cool cult or Straight-Edge scream-an-run about charismatic fundy group would be more appealing to the immature mindset. Anything to rebel against what they're currently part of.\n \n My opinion on UU, it's a made-up 'religion' that didn't go the way of the scam (scientologist for example) that someone founded as a tax-shelter.",

That's a view only held by some religions. But in truth, I don't think the morals espoused by a religion has a lot to do with those who decide to join said religion per se. I think most people look for a community that they're comfortable with. Of course, if you don't like the moral tone of a religion you won't be comfortable with the community it provides, but it's the community that's the sticking point there, not the morals per se.\n \n \n \n\n EDIT: I realised I've deviated a fair bit...

If there's any way to resolve conflicts between religions (and even non-religions), that's certainly one of them. \n\n The idea that there's more than one path seems obvious to me. If there is a benevolant God out there, how could he possibly restrict access to him to only those who follow one very specific path, especially given that most people's path is chosen for them by the accident of where they were born. Either there's more than one path, or God isn't benevolant. I don't see a third option there.",
