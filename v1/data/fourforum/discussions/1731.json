   "This is a spin off from the 'Logic in Atheism' thread.\n \n I'm sure you've all seen the Problem of Evil before, it goes something like this:\n \n Premise: god is good and omnipotent (nb: usually omniscience is included as well, but I think omnipotence implies omniscience anyway - if you don't, include omniscience in the premise).\n \n Therefore:\n 1. God knows about all the evil in the world (omniscience)\n 2. God can stop all the evil in the world (omnipotence)\n 3. God will want to stop all the evil in the world (god is good).\n \n So: there cannot be any evil in a world with a Good and Omnipotent god in it.\n \n An alternative formation involves the origin of evil, i.e. god is good and created everything, so where did evil come from.\n \n Note 1: If you don't think god is good and omnipotent that's fine, we're not discussing your kind of god.\n Note 2: I have no intention of attempting to define evil, if you wish to claim it doesn't exist - go for it. I do not accept the claim that evil is the simple absence of good; if you wish to claim that you will have to argue it.\n \n There have been more than a few attempts to explain the Problem of Evil away (the freewill defence, etc.), but rather than me propose and knock down these arguments in some kind of uber-essay thing I'll leave it to those who disagree with me to propose the arguments they find convicing and we can discuss them.",

Freewill is good.\n \n Therefore it becomes contradictory to stop all things that are evil because that in turn would stop freewill. Would God stop all evil if it also stopped something he seen as good?\n \n If you know anything about me you will know that I debate the existance of the Christian God and look more towards logical reasoning. Logic would indicate here that since God believes freewill to be good that he would allow it to exist even if evil comes of it. As long as God sees freewill as good then it would be evil to prevent freewill. Being that God tries to prevent evil why then would he cause it by preventing freewill on any level? I don't know what type of essay you plan on explaining this possible explaination away with but the entire foundation of it would have to be based on the idea that you have a profound understanding of the Christian God and know that he would not allow evil to happen regardless of how much good it prevented.",

   "Hi Mr. Jack,\n \n I would like to offer my understanding of what you are questioning. I do not claim to be a good debater and sometimes I am far from succinct, so bare with me as I try to explain. \n \n \n \nI'm sure you've all seen the Problem of Evil before, it goes something like this:\n \n Premise: god is good and omnipotent (nb: usually omniscience is included as well, but I think omnipotence implies omniscience anyway - if you don't, include omniscience in the premise).\n \n Therefore:\n 1. God knows about all the evil in the world (omniscience)\n 2. God can stop all the evil in the world (omnipotence)\n 3. God will want to stop all the evil in the world (god is good).\n \n So: there cannot be any evil in a world with a Good and Omnipotent god in it.\n \n An alternative formation involves the origin of evil, i.e. god is good and created everything, so where did evil come from.\n\n \n I agree with point 1. God is omniscience. And as far as point 2, S/He (non-gender) does have unlimited power (omnipotence) and could stop all the evil if He wanted to. And one would think that because of point three, He would want to. BUT...\n \n Here is why I feel God would not want to stop evil in the world...\n \n It is called the Dualities.\n \n \n Everything of this world has an opposite. (with the exception of God, S/he is the Alpha and the Omega, the All and the Everything). Beings there is good, there needs to be an opposite.\n \n The reason why I emphasize need is because if we did not have evil/bad, we would not know good or appreciate good. Just as we need to experience cold to appreciate and know warmth; we need to experience darkness to appreciate and know light; We need to experience death before we can know and appreciate life.\n \n Think about this...would our intelligence be able to evolve if we did not know the negative sides of life? We all learn from experience, and that is why we need to experience the dualities of good and evil, which is also described as negative and positive in the world of physics.\n \n \n And this is why I believe God would not stop evil. S/he wants us to evolve to a higher consciousness...into the Christ Consciousness. (also called the Awakening and the Enlightenment.)\n \n I can go into a much deeper explanation if you need me to.\n \n Lilac Angel",

   "My opinion is this (I'm an atheist, you probably guessed): there are logical and rational forms of both atheism and theism - hell, some of the smartest people I know are Christians. So a theist need not be either illogical or irrational, similarly for atheists. In the specific case of Christianity, I consider biblical literalism (or inerrancy) unsupportable, but more rational strains of Christianity to be both logical and rational. I do not think the Problem of Evil is a problem for Christianity because I don't think the god described in the bible is either perfectly good or omnipotent.\n\n \n Although I agree with you that the Bible cannot be 100% accurate I also have to agree with you that I don't think the problem of evil is a problem for Christianity either. I know you misworded yourself here but you are correct in saying it at least as far as I can tell.

For example I can understand a hot or cold day without ever being near absolute zero, or walking on the sun. What, exactly, is the opposite of green?\n\n I think I've already commented on this but heck, I'll give it another shot. Opposites are necessary for many things.\n \n A person does not call a line crooked without some idea of what a straight line looks like. If you compare two lines, and you say that one is more \"straight\" than another one, you have a fixed idea in your mind of what a straight line is like, and that one of the lines conforms to this standard better than another.\n \n I don't really understand your point about extremes, perhaps you could clarify?\n \n I do not think that anyone here has ever felt supreme evil or supreme good and I don't see why we would need them to properly distinguish evil and good. The opposite of green is, generally, purple. However, a colour like grey, is its own opposite. How do we distinguish grey? Quite simply, from the other colours. If the only colour in the Universe was grey, there would be no \"grey\", it wouldn't have meaning.\n \n However, although it is quite right that there is an opposite for most things, this is not always the case. There is anti-matter while there is matter, there are electrons while there are positrons. However, not all things are just like that. The force carriers like photons and Z-bosons have no \"electrical charge\", and hence - neutral. A photon is its very own anti-particle. Light isn't the opposite of darkness - it is the absence of it. It is light denied. In the same way, good is not the opposite of evil, it is simply the absence of it or goodness denied. \n \n Saying that evilness comes from God would make no more sense than saying that darkness comes from light - from a photon. God is love, and it is that which facilitates goodness. Evil is a privation of goodness, as with coldness. There is no particle or force that we attribute to coldness. Coldness is the absence of heat - of energy. \n \n However, if we go back to our analogy of light and dark we can understand a few more things. If there was only darkness in the universe and no light, how were we to know that it was dark? We wouldn't. \"Dark would be a word without meaning\" ~ C.S. Lewis.",

What, exactly, is the opposite of green?\n\n \n This is where you have to look at the big picture. One cannot figure much of anything out by using one's own personal experiences by itself. In this equation, you have to look at the world as ONE, all peoples as ONE...an overall view.\n \n I do not have to experience death of my own body to understand death.

YOU are saying that stopping evil is a good act. However, GOD is good and therefore, defines what is good. He defines it as dependence on Him, in love. That is good. Evil is necessary so that we will depend on Him. If there were no evil we would have no NEED of God. Love (the verb) can essentially be defined as meeting the needs of another. If we have no need then God cannot love.\n \n NOw, does that mean we should not strive against evil, no. Does it mean that God has not striven against evil, no. God allowed Evil in order to demonstrate His love. How did God defeat evil? He sent His Son to die on a cross. (John 3:16)\n \n You assume that God allowing evil is not good.

The reason I use the word is because I have found that to deny the existance of evil in religious debate forums, turns people away. I am labeled as \"new age\" by many and some religions judge that as \"evil\". So I began speaking their language just to get points across. I prefer to use the terms...negative energy or fear instead of evil.\n \n \nPoliticians are much the same, they dont like someone, he's the devil, he's an evil tyrant, even though he may be a hero to others.\n\n \n When Bush used the judgement of evil in his speeches after 9-11...\"We must kill the evil ones\", I would cringe. The negative feelings that overwelmed me when I would hear those words, gave me a feeling of doom. I do believe in the \"judge and you shall be judged\" wisdom from the bible. So I felt that America was doomed to fail with his judgement. (I still feel we will suffer, sooner or later, from that judgement.)\n \n \nDo you mean the devil, or do you mean an evil deed, or do you mean an evil person?\n\n \n I believe the \"devil\" is a way for people to pass the blame of their own actions onto some other power/entity. \"The devil made me do it\" is a common blame among the religious. This negative power gets more power when people reject their own responsibility. In other words, they pass their own power off to this \"entity\". I believe the power given to this \"devil\" is human created.\n \n \n \nMaybe there is no evil, evil is in our minds, a way of expressing guilt or fear. Maybe evil is an excuse for humans shortcomings and failures, its easy to label something evil if you disagree with it, maybe people cant face things and they label them evil. Thats the easy option, thats why most people take it.\n \n\n \n In many ways, that is what I believe. I also feel that by labeling someone else as evil, helps to make the person with the judgement feel better about theirself. An example here is...\"abortion is evil. It is killing an innocent life.\" but yet these same people believe in sending someone off to war to get \"aborted\" by war. That is not evil to them. They justify their own beliefs and make their self feel better by labeling someone else as worse than them.\n \n \n \nAm i making sense here?\n\n \n You made perfect sense to me.

   "What I was really trying to say that it is not a substance. It is the privation of something. We might call it is the opposite, but I'm not too sure how much sense that makes.\n \n Same thing here. God creating something that is not a substance doesn't really make sense. God might have made it possible for it to occur (via free moral agency) but He has no evil - it would violate His nature, and He also cannot lie. He might have made it possible for it to occur, in which case it comes from free moral agents, but it does not come from Him - check my photon analogy.\n \n That's not strictly correct. The relationship between heat and energy is quite identical to that of work and energy. I didn't mention that objects have no energy, and I didn't say that coldness was strictly absent of energy, I simply said that colder ones have a greater absence of it. There cannot be heat where there is not energy. Where there is absolute zero (Kelvin's) there is no energy. Energy is not annihilated or created in a closed system - yes.\n\n \n Thanks for your clarification. I don't disagree with anything you said there. As far as the last paragraph, I can't debate that at all. As I have mentioned before...the details of science are one of my ignorances.

SThe presence of sin is certainly a consequence for what man chose. The punishment (curse) came after the sin. Punishment will be eternal separation from God. Jesus did not die to prove Satan wrong. No where does it say that in the bible. Jesus died to make man righteous once again. It still must be accepted. That is the whole focus of the letters of John. Also, James and Peter. Jesus teachings are important to be sure, but the living of them comes from identifying with Jesus. It is throught the power of Christ that we are ABLE to do those things.\n \n We were not created perfect. It does not say that anywhere. Show me if you can. Man was created in unconfirmed righteousness. (God declared it good, not perfect.) Jesus was able to save himself, but instead submitted to the father's will and descended to hell for three days where He was ressurrected to SIT at the right hand of the Father. \n \n Now, I know where this is going and we will eventually wind up at the discussion of the doctrine of the trinity and the deity of Jesus.

   "Actually this has nothing to do with the trinity, nor hell. It is just the concept of salvation. It is spot on for this thread. The problem of evil.\n \n What did Jesus go to hell for If he was not evil?\n \n BTW EF this is a unique debate I never heard of and denomination say that God creates imperfect things.\n\n \n I use the word imperfect the way the bible does. The concept at that time was that of incompleteness. God made man needing God. That was his purpose. \n \n In the garden, did you ever wonder WHY God brought Adam all the animals to name them. The answer comes right after Adam named them. God did this to show Adam that he was not complete without a woman. God created woman shortly thereafter. Still, man is incomplete without God. The point that God was showing Adam was that Adam had needs outside himself. So, imperfect, meaning intentional incompleteness.",

This may sound strange but that can apply to all dictators who have killed for such reasons.\n \n On the other hand if a person kills, for no apparent reason, then is he evil or just plain mad? There were rumours that hitler had an illness, which could have driven him mad, or would he still be evil, if as you say he was lost then maybe he was mad, does that make him evil. Another interesting point, who would be more evil, hitler or his henchmen?",

   "Jehovas witnesses.\n \n This is what i know about jehovas witnesses. They knock on your door, uninvited, usually on a sunday morning, and start to preach to you. \n \n They always start by asking this question \"do you believe in god\"?\n \n I answer by saying \"why, who are you\"?\n \n Then they say, \"we are here to help you understand\"\n \n Then i say, 'understand what\"?\n \n Then they say, \"the true meaning of god and jesus\"\n \n And before they can finish, i thank them for waking me up and bid them farewell. They of course carry on preaching, but i think they understand when they see the door close.\n \n Another thing i know about jehovas witnesses is they dont allow blood transfusions, im not sure if you go to doctors or not, but thats about it.\n \n So what do jehovas witnesses think then?\n\n \n Okay the short story is (those who already know can ignore this) we are Unitarians, we don't have a hell, barely a heaven, beleave in immortality for all in the future, we think Jesus was the first angel, we are political non-participants, and object to military service. We take the great commission in Mathew to preach until the end of the world literally. The world is still here, which means we show up at your door (like some surreal light house keeper). We are controversial because we hold Acts command against blood. We are also banned generally in the Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia (anyplace with compulsory military service and few religious freedoms). Among the first people the Nazi's locked up and started executing (see above). France hates us. Every few years in the USA some small town tries to ban us from door knocking until the courts step in.\n \n We go to doctor all the time. General we are \"better\" citizens than most because we are so God fearing it is scary. Most other Christina religions don't like us because we have seedy origins and we basically reverse engineered Christianity from the bible in the late 1800's. In belief we straddle the fence between Judaism and \"The Church\". If we were a beer we're like those expensive microbrews \"Christianity Extra Dry\". Oh yeah and since nothing is scared to us we change our doctrine every now and then. This infuriates other religions I have no idea why. We think the Devil controls the earth and not God.\n \n This post makes no sense.",
