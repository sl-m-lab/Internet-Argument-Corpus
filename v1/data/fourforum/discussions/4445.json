   "http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1109937777759_4?hub=topstories\n \n The single greatest loss of life at one time for the RCMP in over 100 years.\n \n Apparently the the RCMP had discovered a marijuana grow-op at a remote farmyard the day before and secured the area. The shooter snuck in overnight, unseen by the two officers at the site, and when they were joined by two more officers in the AM, he opened fire and killed all four of them. It's unclear whether he then killed himself or whether one of the officers killed him, but at this point it appears as though the gunman turned the gun on himself is one final act of cowardice.\n \n What a senseless and tragic event. All of the officers were young family men.\n \n My deepest sympathies to their family and friends.\n \n Waxy",

   "My sympathies to the families also. \n \n What kind of firepower do the RCMP carry? Is there any indication how the killer was able to get the drop on four of them without being killed himself?\n\n \n I know they carry Glock side arms, but I'm not sure of the caliber. 9mm perhaps? All of the officers were also carrying 12ga shotguns.\n \n The latest info is that he ambushed the 4 officers in his farmyard from close range with a semi-automatic high powered rifle. \n \n My uncle has a Browning semi auto 7mm Rem Mag, and I'm pretty confident that from 50yds in, if there were 4 deer standing in a group, oblivious to my presence, I could down all four before they could run away. Given that the officers would likely have frozen or attempted to return fire, giving the shooter more time, I have no problem getting around the logistics of the shooting.\n \n All 4 officers were young and rather inexperienced. There'll be a full scale investigation into the incident, but naturally the RCMP is claiming that everything was done right. I suspect that a combination of inexperience and too casual of an attitude on everyone's part were contributing factors. Apparently the man was well known to police as a violent offender and was known to be in the area, so IMHO, sufficient precautions were not taken.\n \n Waxy",
