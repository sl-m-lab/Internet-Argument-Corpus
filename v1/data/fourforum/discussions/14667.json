   "Saw a great article today by Michael Bloomberg (yes, that Michael Bloomberg), about where the illegal guns used in crimes come from - mainly from the states with weak gun control laws. This is unsurprising to most rational folk, but yet we still hear the pro-gun clarion call to have no new gun laws, etc.\n \n So here's the article for all to read: Stop spread of illegal guns from states with weak laws - CNN.com\n \nA handful of states with weak gun laws are the largest contributors to the U.S. market for illegally trafficked guns. That's the alarming finding of \"Trace the Guns: The Link Between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun Trafficking,\" a new groundbreaking report issued by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition of more than 500 mayors that I co-chair with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino.\n \n \"Trace the Guns\" examines troves of new data released to Mayors Against Illegal Guns by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and for the first time demonstrates the connection between laws designed to deter illegal trafficking and lower export rates for guns used in crimes.\n \n \n Mississippi, West Virginia, Kentucky, Alaska, Alabama, South Carolina, Virginia, Indiana, Nevada and Georgia were the 10 states that supplied guns used in crimes at the highest rates -- each of them supplying such guns at a rate more than twice the national average.\n \n \n Not only do they supply a disproportionate amount of crime guns, but these states are also more likely to be the source of guns recovered in crimes within two years of the original sale, which the ATF said is a key sign of illegal trafficking.\n \n See for yourself: Read the report and see where guns are coming from in your state on the website TraceTheGuns.org.\n \n \n The stakes are high: 12,000 people a year are murdered with guns in the United States. If one state ignores a gap in its laws, other states have to deal with the deadly consequences.\n \n \n There is urgent work to be done by policymakers at all levels to strengthen enforcement of the laws we have on the books, and to close gaps in state and federal law. For example, the gun show loophole enables people with criminal records to avoid FBI background checks if they buy a gun from an unlicensed \"private seller.\"\n \n \n The report shows that states where this loophole is open export crime guns at 21/2 times the rate of states that have closed it. The ATF has long identified gun shows as a leading source for traffickers, and while we didn't need any more proof that legislators should put a stop to this end run around background checks, we now have it.\n \n \n \"Trace the Guns\" should serve as a clear road map for how we can more effectively fight illegal gun trafficking, support police and protect public safety -- and mayors around the country will be urging lawmakers in state capitols and in Washington to take action.\n \n \n To see how your state stacks up, visit TraceTheGuns.org. \n",

   "Oh come on! You're not buying this bilge water are you? You've gotta be jerking our chain or something, no rational person could possibly believe this nonsense.\n \n First and foremost, Bloomberg cites Virginia amongst other states, as being a source of \"crime guns\" that get trafficked into New York. But Virginia has a firearms rationing law, meaning a person can only buy one handgun in a 30 day period, which Bloomberg and others claim are supposed to stop gun trafficking from happening.\n \n Secondly, if you'd been following the mess in Mexico you'd know that the ATF has said that they're going to stop releasing trace data numbers, because said numbers are being misused for political agendas and don't reflect hard data about crime trends.\n \n Third, in case you or anybody else didn't realize it, just because a firearm is traced, that doesn't mean that it was used in a crime. Firearms are traced for many, many different reasons. They could be recovered at the scene of a crime or any other location, they could be found abandoned after the occurrence of a natural disaster, or they could have foolishly been part of a \"gun buy back\" program that ultimately does nothing.\n \n Fourth, simply because a gun from Mississippi is found in New York doesn't mean it was criminally trafficked in. People move all the time, and when they do they usually take their stuff with them. And if their gun is stolen while in New York, and found in New York, the trace will show that it was originally bought in Mississippi. It's not rocket science.\n \n Fifth, what report? What study? Who conducted the study? What data did they use? Who fact checked it? Who reviewed it? Who funded it? Who commissioned it? Who gave it the go ahead?\n \n Sixth, this is nothing more than Bloomberg whining and crying about how utterly insignificant he is, and lamenting that he's not as powerful and authoritative as he wants to be. He's mad that he doesn't have the judicial power to regulate anything beyond New York City, so he' stomping his feet and calling for congress to change the laws of every other city and state to reflect those of New York City.\n \n If the laws of New York City are so easily defeated by simply crossing the border, then those laws prove useless in the fight against crime and should be repealed and brought into line with the rest of the country; not the rest of the country being brought into line with the city.\n \n You should also be aware of some facts that the article doesn't mention. More and more mayors in the little MAIG group are being charged with felony offenses for various crimes they've committed, meaning Bloomberg's gang is a mess of criminals.\n \n And then there's the fact that Bloomberg wants to have people arrested for failing a NICS background check, while at the same time calling for laws that would make a person fail simply because their name is on a secret government watchlist that's highly inaccurate and based on outdated sources, incomplete information, and mere suspicion rather than hard facts, with absolutely no way to appeal the decision or get off the list.",

It includes this:\n \n \n AT THE TIME of the founding, the ability of the states to call a convention to propose amendments was seen as a way to prevent the federal government from becoming too expansive. In essay No. 85 of the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton cited the states' convention option in his response to critics who feared that Congress would never allow any amendments limiting its power. The Constitution orders that \"The Congress shall call a convention\" if two-thirds of states demand one, he pointed out, and thus whether to call a convention isn't up to the federal government. \"We may safely rely on the disposition of the state legislatures to erect barriers against the encroachments of the national authority,\" he predicted. \n \n Yet as time went on, people came to see a convention as more nefarious, forming misconceptions about what it might mean, according to new research by Robert Natelson, who recently left his post as a law professor at the University of Montana to join the Independence Institute. Those misconceptions, Natelson says, start with the very name of the proceeding.\n \n \"It is not a constitutional convention,\" Natelson, who has written two forthcoming papers on the subject, told TAS. \"Nobody at the time it was drafted ever called it a constitutional convention. It started to get that name only in the 20th century, as far as I can determine, when that term was applied to it by some people who were opposed to an Article V convention, because they opposed the proposed amendments.\"\n \n The Constitution itself refers to a \"convention for proposing amendments.\"\n \n \"It was not until the 1960s, when several conservative groups were seeking a convention to propose amendments in order to reverse some of the liberal Supreme Court decisions, that liberal scholars and activists, like Charles Black of Yale Law School, or Theodore Sorensen, the Kennedy speechwriter, basically made up this idea that what you're doing is you're creating a big unlimited constitutional convention that could become a circus,\" he said.\n \n Indeed, one reason for conservative suspicions is that liberals themselves have proposed a constitutional convention in order to make it easier to realize leftist policy goals. In 2006, for instance, University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson wrote a well-received book, Our Undemocratic Constitution: Where the Constitution Goes Wrong (and How We the People Can Correct It). He argued for a convention in which the entire founding document is fair game.\n \n But according to Natelson, there is a difference. While a constitutional convention is called to rewrite the Constitution, an \"amendments convention\" or \"Article V convention\" is tailored to a narrow purpose.\n \n \"The Founders believed that this method would be used more than has probably been used,\" he said. \"It was seen precisely as a way of getting constitutional change that an abusive or corrupt Congress would not itself authorize.... To the extent that many people believe today that a Congress is abusing or exceeding its powers, this is precisely the situation that the Founders crafted this provision in the Constitution to serve.\"\n \n Critics of the idea contend that once the convention is called, there would be no way to limit its scope. But Natelson argued that there are a number of built-in checks to prevent that from happening.\n \n \"The convention is bound by the nature of the call,\" Natelson said. \"So if it's been told to propose an amendment forbidding the government from being involved in health care, that is the only issue it may address.\"\n In Federalist No. 85, Hamilton wrote that \"every amendment to the Constitution, if once established, would be a single proposition, and might be brought forward singly. . . . The will of the requisite number would at once bring the matter to a decisive issue. And consequently, whenever nine, or rather ten States, were united in the desire of a particular amendment, that amendment must infallibly take place.\" Currently, it would take 34 states to call a convention, and 38 states to ratify an amendment.\n \n Even if a convention passed non-germane amendments, Congress would not even be permitted to submit them to the states for ratification if they went beyond the topic in the initial petitions for a convention. And courts would have to disallow them even if Congress did.\n \n Furthermore, there's the political check, because if delegates were sent to the convention to address one issue and began to do something completely different, it would make the public back home \"furious,\" Natelson argued.\n And ultimately, any proposed amendment would have to be ratified by three-fourths of state legislatures to alter the founding document.\n \n But the article also presents several sources who object to calling for an amendments convention. It even discusses the Repeal Amendment!\n \n \n \n \n",

Because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws. In the US, there is too much inconsistency in gun laws.",

   "Yes, caught in a sting operation. Are the firearm transactions they made in NY illegal in Virginia as well?\n\n \n Don&#8217;t know enough to say for sure. Just selling on the secondary market is not illegal in Virginia. Possessing firearms while possessing controlled substances is a felony in Virginia. Possessing a &#8220;sawed-off&#8221; shotgun is a felony in Virginia, if it meets the definition of having a barrel less than 18 inches. A rifle with the stock removed can also be a felony of possessing a &#8220;sawed- off rifle&#8221; in Virginia if the total length of the firearm is less than 26 inches.\n \n \nYou might as well compare the health of a group of teenagers who smoke to the health of a group of senior citizens who don't smoke in an effort to study the relationship between health and tobacco use.\n\n \n Let me make my argument plain. I am not arguing there is a link between crime rates and the availability of guns. That is the mayor&#8217;s argument, and I am disputing it. I have always argued that social, economic, and environmental factors drive crime rates&#8212;not the ease which one can get a gun. \n \n NY does not claim the purpose of its restrictive laws is to punish its citizens, to deny them a constitutional right, or to discriminate against peaceable gun owners. NY sells its restrictive gun control scheme as a crime control measure. The theory behind this is simple: more guns = more crime, and therefore less guns = less crime. NY argues that if we can have laws that severely restrict gun possession then we will have fewer guns and thus fewer crimes. The problem is no one can show where the laws are having the intended effect&#8212;and critics complain that the laws are a failure. NY responds by arguing that their gun restriction scheme cannot get a fair test to prove its worth because gun runners evade the restrictions by going to other states with less restrictive laws to import the guns illegally. Therefore, NY argues, despite the restrictions guns are still too easy to get. \n \n If I have misstated the issue then let me know. \n \n I choose to compare Virginia to NY for two reasons: 1. Bloomberg cites Virginia as a problem, and 2. I live in Virginia and know its gun laws. This is not a comparison of have and have-nots (like your smoker/non-smoker analogy). Both areas have plenty of guns. They also have similar population sizes, and in any event the statistics I used are per capita. The question I am looking at is does the simple math more guns = more crime/less guns = less crime have any truth to it as the mayor suggests? I say no.\n \n Neither mayor Bloomberg nor I will ever know exactly how many guns are in NY or Virginia. But the mayor&#8217;s argument does not rest on knowledge of a total number. Rather, his more guns = more crime equation relies upon his argument over the ease which one can get a gun in NY&#8212;easy he says because of gun runners evading the city&#8217;s legal restrictions. In short, he argues his crime rate is elevated because of the ease of obtaining guns. \n \n Why then can&#8217;t he explain Virginia&#8217;s comparatively lower crime rate?\n \n We know that legally guns are much easier to get in Virginia. Virginia&#8217;s laws are much less restrictive. Does the mayor argue that Virginia&#8217;s gun laws have a worse effect on crime in his city than they do in Virginia&#8212;that there is something magical about Virginia that allows the state&#8217;s crime rate to suffer less from the effect of the same lax gun laws he says are driving the crime rate in his city so far away? No. He simply ignores Virginia&#8217;s comparatively lower crime rate because it contradicts his premise. \n \n We know that physically guns are much easier to get in Virginia&#8212;the stores that sell these guns are here, the gun shows are also here. In fact, by its own argument NY agrees guns are more plentiful and much easier to get in Virginia, since it claims that these guns must be and are originally purchased (with ease) in Virginia and then moved into NY. \n \n I know that guns are also cheaper in Virginia. A typical cost of 1K in NY? (from Sinjin&#8217;s cited article) That is an astronomical average price in Virginia.\n \n Now can we also look at Canadian provinces as you suggest? Sure. Let me ask you about this comment:\n \n \nI don't think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state. Virginia has a higher homicide rate that most Canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison\n\n \n First, let&#8217;s accept for a moment your claim that my comparison is invalid because we are talking about a &#8220;densely populated city&#8221; vs. a &#8220;whole state.&#8221; \n Virginia beach, Virginia is the largest urban city in Virginia with nearly twice the population of any other urban center in the state. Its 2009 crime rates are:\n \n Population: 436,175\n Violent crimes: 910\n Homicides/Manslaughters: 18 \n Violent Crime Rate: 1 for every 479 people, or 212 per 100,000 people\n Homicide/Manslaughter rate: 1 for every 24,232 people, or 4.2 per 100,000 people\n \n Now I agree this is a much smaller sample size than the population of NY, but it&#8217;s the largest one in Virginia, and the per capita rates are still significantly lower than NY. But let me move past the urban vs. urban comparison to my main point&#8230;. \n \n Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I think you have hit the nail on the head. The mayor cannot show why his crime rate is higher than Virginia&#8217;s simply by arguing more guns = more crime. He must instead return to reality, abandon the crusade against an inanimate object, and accept that social, economic, and environmental differences between NY and Virginia drive these crime rates. This is my argument: The availability of the gun has little to do with crime rates.\n \n Now think about this for a moment: If the mayor is correct, if it is as simple as more guns = more crime, then who cares about differences in population density? That is not a factor in the mayor&#8217;s equation. When you say the different population density means the comparison is invalid, aren&#8217;t you agreeing that different environmental and social factors drive these different crime rates? Isn&#8217;t this an admission that the different crime rates are not driven by the availability of guns&#8212;that mayor is wrong when he says the issue is more guns = more crime? I read your comment that way. Tell me if I am wrong. If this is your argument then I agree with you. \n \n The problem is the mayor seems to disagree with both of us. For him the math is simple: more guns = more crime, and NY can have less crime if it has less guns. This is the argument I am disputing. The more guns = more crime claim is a myth the mayor cannot put substance to. I say social and economic factors drive crime rates, and you may or may not agree with this. Yet the mayor tells you there are three factors to blame: the gun, the gun, and the gun again. \n \n He makes the argument, and he should be able to explain why the crime rate is lower in a state he targets for having lax gun laws. He cannot do it, because his &#8220;more guns = more crime measured by the ease of getting a gun math&#8221; cannot survive contact with the reality that the crime rate is lower in a state where guns are easier to come by. \n \n IMO the mayor should be focused on asking why people in NY commit more crimes. But this is a hard issue for politicians to deal with. Instead of asking the difficult questions of why people want to use guns to commit crimes, he finds it easier to say it&#8217;s the gun&#8217;s fault. He and other politicians can grandstand for the cameras and say there is an &#8220;iron pipeline&#8221; all they want. I just want them to explain why the crime rate is lower at the end where all the guns come from. This they cannot do without abandoning the more guns = more crime myth. This they cannot do without admitting that social, economic, and environmental factors unique to NY drive NY&#8217;s crime rate regardless of how many guns are brought in. \n \n What factors affect the demand, Mayor Bloomberg, of the criminals in your city for guns that provides such a large and profitable market for gun runners? What have you done to reduce the reasons why people want to commit crimes with guns? \n \n To use your &#8220;plug the holes in the boat&#8221; analogy, Galileo: Mayor Bloomberg, what are you doing to convince people in NY that it&#8217;s time to stop putting all these holes in the boat in the first place?",

A relationship needs two or more parts to exist and be recognized, but violence and crime exists independently without the existence or availability of specific weapons.\n \n \n\"From Dr. Roth's study: The overall fatality rate in gun robberies is an estimated 4 per 1,000--about 3 times the rate for knife robberies, 10 times the rate for robberies with other weapons, and 20 times the rate for robberies by unarmed offenders.\"\n A Case for Gun Control\n\n \n None of which is evidence that restricting RIGHTS will do anything to deter or stop CRIME!\n \n Where are the credentials of this Dr. Roth person? Show me the details!\n \n \n\"A comparison of hospital admissions of wound victims in South Africa found that 6% of knife wounds were fatal, while 28% of those with firearm wounds died.\"\n http://www.ippnw.org/PDF/Marsh.pdf\n\n \n Is South Africa one of your other \"developed nations\" that you keep talking about?\n \n Weren't you just the one who said it's not a good idea to compare the statistics from one place to another?\n \n \nThese statistics suggest that guns may not increase or decrease the total amount of violent crime, but they may increase the proportion of violent crime which result in fatalities.\n\n \n Or they could reduce the total amounts of violent offenders that actively initiate these crimes.\n \n \nSo in England and Wales only 0.07% of violent crimes result in fatalities compared to 1.95% in Virginia. If Virginia had the same proportion of violent crimes which involve fatalities as England and Wales that would result in 0.243 murders in Virginia (347 * .07%= 0.243). So almost 347 lives could be saved in Virginia!\n\n \n Meanwhile you conveniently ignore the fact that England and Wales have always had low homicide rates even before they restricted gun ownership to the point it's at today.\n \n You also ignore the fact that all gun control laws must pass the strict scrutiny test in order to survive constitutional muster. England style gun control would never pass such a test, therefore such proposals won't be heard.",

They should listen carefully to his advice,\" says Linton.\n Mauser has studied the fiasco of the clumsy attempt to register firearms in Canada, the evidence showing it is a financial calamity threatening to engulf the current Canadian Government:\n Costs have escalated from a projected $2 Million to a current $2 Billion, and no evidence can be found to show that the Gun Registry has accomplished anything of value.Violent crime & suicide rates remain constant in Canada, even though they are falling in the US. The homicide rate is falling faster in the US than in Canada.\n \"The only thing Gun Registration has achieved in Canada is to squander valuable Police resources and $2 Billion of taxpayers hard-earned money,\" claims Linton.\n Linton further states that the results of the Canadian experience with gun control mirror those of our western neighbour, Australia, where violent crime has increased 45% since the Australian government imposed \"draconian gun laws by decree.\"New Zealand Police should be applauded for the decision they made in 1982 to abandon Gun Registration which was a blight on their resources, and had a 40% error rate.\n Linton concludes that \"gun control is not crime control.

   "Another estimate is 200 lives saved by defensive gun use:\n \"Except that 16% of violent crimes do not result in the victim's death. In fact, only 0.35% of assaults result in death (Kleck table 5.8). 0.35%*80,000=300 lives saved with guns each year. This is an overestimate since it assumes that guns are 100% effective and that all of the 80,000 crimes that guns were used to defend against were assaults when in fact some were robberies and burglaries (which have lower fatality rates than assaults). Correcting for these would give an estimate of more like 200.\n The NCS undercounts crimes like domestic assault, so the 80,000 could be too low, possibly even by a factor of two. This possibility does not affect the estimate above, since the undercounting will cause a compensating overestimate in the lethality of assaults.\"\n How many lives are saved by defensive gun use? : Deltoid\n\n \n Besides being complete bull****, it's completely irrelevant.

   "This headline almost sounds like this is good news! But then note the qualifiers of stagnant and stable. \n   Firearm murders down in Canada: StatsCan \n OTTAWA &#8212; Homicide rates across Canada are stagnant and the number of them committed using firearms has dropped considerably, according to new figures that are raising questions about the Conservative government's tough-on-crime agenda.\n \n According to the study, homicide rates across the country are stable &#8212; and have been since 1999 following a decline that started in the mid-1970s &#8212; with 610 reported in 2009.\n\n Stagnant. Stable.

Of the 253 firearms used to kill between 2005 and 2009, 69 per cent were found not to be registered, while 31 per cent were &#8212; the bulk of them rifles or shotguns, which fall under the controversial long-gun registry.\n \n During the five-year period, police were able to determine the ownership of the firearm in 212 homicides. In nearly half the cases, the gun was owned by the accused.\n \n NDP justice critic Joe Comartin said the figures suggest the registry is helping law enforcement trace guns and prosecute offenders.\n \n But as many of the non-registered weapons are either prohibited or restricted hand guns and sawed off shotguns, Comartin said it's also an indication that Canada has a problem with gang-related gun smuggling.\n \n \"We need to shut the border down,\" he said, adding targeting youth gangs would put a significant dent in Canada's overall homicide rate. \n\n How did the CDC put it? \n&#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n\n What did the article say the NAS studies showed? \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n \n As Galileo and the rest of the gun control minions march into the Brady Campaign, they sing. \n Wo ye wo! Gun Control. Wo ye wo! Wo ~ o ~ o! emoticon_smile\n \n So all of that gun control for a stable murder rate, less murder with guns, but the same amount of carnage. Is that a good thing?

(AP) - The New York Police Department's four-year-old registry of gun-toting criminals, meant to curb city violence, faces a legal challenge in the state's highest court.\n \n The novel measure, advocated by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has since been copied by other municipalities including Utica, N.Y., Baltimore, Chicago and Washington, D.C., according to city officials.\n \n Lawyers for a repeat felon stopped in Manhattan with a loaded 9 mm semi-automatic pistol in his car say he shouldn't have to register and report to the NYPD every six months for the four years after he gets out of prison. They say state law and parole provisions trump the city measure.\n \n \"This court should not allow New York City or any other local government to act without authority in fashioning their own rules to deal with convicted felons in their communities and then argue that these local schemes are beyond review of this court,\" attorney Bruce Austern argued in his brief on behalf of Sean Smith.\n \n Following his arrest, Smith pleaded guilty to two counts of felony gun possession, which in the plea bargain meant five years in prison and five years of probation. The judge also handed him a form for the NYPD gun offender registry to fill out.\n \n City officials say their measure is separate, and legally overlaps with those other laws. They say the registry law is to deter the group of felons who are four times likelier to commit homicides.\n \n \"This is a group that you want to have your eyes on,\" said John Feinblatt, Bloomberg's chief policy adviser.\n \n Feinblatt didn't immediately know how many gun felons were on the NYPD list, guessing there were hundreds, or whether the four-year reporting requirement had led to further felony arrests, or to the misdemeanor charges and fines for failing to report to NYPD every six months or when they change addresses.\n \n Questions to the police department were not immediately answered.\n \n The Court of Appeals is set to hear arguments this month and expected to rule in December.\n",

Ironic.\n \n [QUOTE]There is more than one irony here, in spite of extremely rigid and restrictive gun control laws, often the wrong people in Mexico still have the guns. Now, unregistered gun ownership has hugely increased among the Mexican cartels and gangs. The average citizen is unarmed and often helpless in regard to self defense. \n \n Our U.S. Constitution was framed by individuals who believed that armed citizens could protect themselves from tyranny. This was based upon the early Revolutionary War experience fought by American patriots. Thus given the differences in culture and history between the countries of Mexico and the United States, the divergence of gun ownership laws have clearly resulted in failure for our neighbors in the south. \n \n Is this a commentary against gun control and registration in the U.S.? You can arrive at your own conclusions. Should we look at the failure of the Mexican gun ownership policy model and go back and read the Second Amendment, which allows Americans to bear arms for self defense?

Paterson has called for $3 billion in budget cuts. The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association has a suggestion for saving several million taxpayer dollars each year: abolish the Combined Ballistic Identification System (COBIS).\n \n The COBIS program was introduced by Gov. Pataki in 2000. Its stated purpose is to collect identifying data from the shell casings of all new handguns sold in the state. This information is then entered into a database for use by law enforcement to aid in identifying and prosecuting criminals. Since its inception, over a quarter of a million shell cases have been collected and entered into the database at an estimated cost of $32 million and not a single arrest or conviction has resulted. In fact, COBIS has proven to be such a boondoggle that no other state is even considering implementing their own version of it.\n \n If Gov. Paterson is serious about saving money, then COBIS ought to be at the top of the list of programs to be cut.\n \n",

There wouldn't be enough staff available to review the records every single day to ensure the utmost accuracy is maintained, eliminating old and outdated records once new ones become available, ensuring the records are easily accessible at a minute's notice rather than just being stored in some warehouse in a haphazard manner, etc. It's a logistics nightmare that eclipses that Obamacare bill.\n \n The left hand of the ATF doesn't know what the right hand is doing as it is now, and the news mentions that. The various divisions don't communicate with each other in an accurate fashion, one official is constantly overriding another and leaving contradictory standards in place, losing important information, and misplacing their own records regarding inventory, warranting the examination of sales records to correct their own mistakes. And the Washington Post paints an even bleaker image with their tracing center, where all records have to be analyzed by hand, the quality of the records deteriorating from time, and having tens of thousands of boxes to go through.\n \n Do you really think tasking them with several million more tracing requests per year is gonna make things any better? Do you seriously expect catching criminals to become more streamlined with a drastically expanded database standard that eclipses the nightmare that's already in place?\n \n \nDocumentation of secondary sales means that when a gun is traced, it's traced to the person who is the present legal owner. How much that assists any given prosecution depends on other factors.\n\n \n See above.\n \n \nNeither issue requires outlawing private ownership of firearms to address.\n\n \n It does when you seek to outlaw the \"private\" aspect by implementing total oversight by the government.\n \n \nSo?

In fact, we supply crime guns at a rate that is three times below the national average and seven times below that of the ten states with the highest crime gun export rates. \n \n The bad news is that a lot of crime guns are flowing into California from other states. For every one crime gun that California exports, we get more than two crime guns imported back into our state. And two of our neighboring states are among the fifteen highest crime gun exporters in the nation. In 2009, Nevada (the nation's 9th highest exporting state) and Arizona (13th) exported more than 1,300 guns recovered in California crimes. Neither Nevada nor Arizona have enacted any of the ten gun laws associated in the report with reduced illegal gun trafficking.\" \n \n Antonio Villaraigosa: Crime Guns Crossing Borders and Taking Lives",

   "Sinjin-\n \n You can make all the claims you want that you're not anti-gun. But when you readily cite notoriously anti-gun individuals and organizations that basically undoes everything you try and claim.\n \n Let's have a look at the LVAC and who they get their money from: Grant List: The Joyce Foundation\n \n That's quite a lot of grants coming in from the pro-gun control Joyce Foundation. Quite a sizable amount over a number of grants. Why do you think that is?\n \n And while we're on the subject of the funders and the fundees, let's see who else the Joyce Foundation has given money to.\n \n Grant List: The Joyce Foundation\n \n The Joyce Foundation has contributed to a great many anti-gun organizations, some of them with ideas that heavily conflict with Heller and McDonald to the point they claim that the Supreme Court was absolutely wrong both times.\n \n You can't really claim that you're not anti-gun if you keep citing these nuts.\n \n And then let's take a look at the article you cited:\n \n \"Our laws - including a requirement to run a criminal background check on nearly every kind of firearms transfer - are the reason why we have one of the lowest rates of crime gun exports in the country. In fact, we supply crime guns at a rate that is three times below the national average and seven times below that of the ten states with the highest crime gun export rates.\"\n \n So California doesn't export firearms to other states. But in the same article they claim:\n \n \"The bad news is that a lot of crime guns are flowing into California from other states. For every one crime gun that California exports, we get more than two crime guns imported back into our state.\"\n \n That would basically mean that California is a state with a notoriously high demand for weapons for criminal purposes. No wonder their exports are so low, the state is filled with the kind of customers that generate the demand for \"crime guns\". Your state is filled with scum and villainy.\n \n And then there's this little tidbit:\n \n \"The Legal Community Against Violence has rated California as having the strongest gun laws in the nation.\"\n \n This statement is contradicted by the Violence Policy Center with their article here: VPC - Press Release - (07/21/2010) - National State-by-State Study of Drive-By Shootings Reveals Data on Victims, Time, Location\n \n \"California led the nation in the number of drive-by shootings with 148 shootings, killing 40 and injuring 129. Following California were: Texas, 60 drive-by shootings, killing six and injuring 52; Florida, 48 drive-by shootings, killing 10 and injuring 42; Illinois, 38 drive-by shootings, killing 18 and injuring 53; and, Washington, 38 drive-by shootings, killing three and injuring 21.\"\n \n The states with the laxer gun control laws had the lower numbers of drive by shootings, while California was at the very top, with the most numbers ever seen. \n \n California's population density is just slightly higher than that of Illinois, and yet the number of drive by shootings in Illinois is nearly one fourth that of California. Florida's population density is considerably higher than that of California, but they only experienced about a third the number of drive by shootings as compared to California.",

The fact is, only 17 percent of guns found at Mexican crime scenes have been traced to the U.S.\n \n What's true, an ATF spokeswoman told FOXNews.com, in a clarification of the statistic used by her own agency's assistant director, \"is that over 90 percent of the traced firearms originate from the U.S.\"\n \n But a large percentage of the guns recovered in Mexico do not get sent back to the U.S. for tracing, because it is obvious from their markings that they do not come from the U.S.\n \n \"Not every weapon seized in Mexico has a serial number on it that would make it traceable, and the U.S. effort to trace weapons really only extends to weapons that have been in the U.S. market,\" Matt Allen, special agent of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told FOX News.\n \n Video:Click here to watch more.\n \n A Look at the Numbers\n \n In 2007-2008, according to ATF Special Agent William Newell, Mexico submitted 11,000 guns to the ATF for tracing. Close to 6,000 were successfully traced -- and of those, 90 percent -- 5,114 to be exact, according to testimony in Congress by William Hoover -- were found to have come from the U.S.\n \n But in those same two years, according to the Mexican government, 29,000 guns were recovered at crime scenes.\n \n In other words, 68 percent of the guns that were recovered were never submitted for tracing. And when you weed out the roughly 6,000 guns that could not be traced from the remaining 32 percent, it means 83 percent of the guns found at crime scenes in Mexico could not be traced to the U.S.\n \n So, if not from the U.S., where do they come from? There are a variety of sources:\n \n -- The Black Market. Mexico is a virtual arms bazaar, with fragmentation grenades from South Korea, AK-47s from China, and shoulder-fired rocket launchers from Spain, Israel and former Soviet bloc manufacturers.\n \n -- Russian crime organizations. Interpol says Russian Mafia groups such as Poldolskaya and Moscow-based Solntsevskaya are actively trafficking drugs and arms in Mexico.\n \n - South America. During the late 1990s, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) established a clandestine arms smuggling and drug trafficking partnership with the Tijuana cartel, according to the Federal Research Division report from the Library of Congress.\n \n -- Asia. According to a 2006 Amnesty International Report, China has provided arms to countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Chinese assault weapons and Korean explosives have been recovered in Mexico.\n \n -- The Mexican Army. More than 150,000 soldiers deserted in the last six years, according to Mexican Congressman Robert Badillo. ;B]Many took their weapons with them, including the standard issue M-16 assault rifle made in Belgium.[/B]\n \n -- Guatemala. U.S. intelligence agencies say traffickers move immigrants, stolen cars, guns and drugs, including most of America's cocaine, along the porous Mexican-Guatemalan border. On March 27, La Hora, a Guatemalan newspaper, reported that police seized 500 grenades and a load of AK-47s on the border. Police say the cache was transported by a Mexican drug cartel operating out of Ixcan, a border town.\n \n 'These Don't Come From El Paso'\n \n Ed Head, a firearms instructor in Arizona who spent 24 years with the U.S. Border Patrol, recently displayed an array of weapons considered \"assault rifles\" that are similar to those recovered in Mexico, but are unavailable for sale in the U.S.\n \n \"These kinds of guns -- the auto versions of these guns -- they are not coming from El Paso,\" he said. \"They are coming from other sources. They are brought in from Guatemala. They are brought in from places like China. They are being diverted from the military. But you don't get these guns from the U.S.\"\n \n Some guns, he said, \"are legitimately shipped to the government of Mexico, by Colt, for example, in the United States. They are approved by the U.S. government for use by the Mexican military service. The guns end up in Mexico that way -- the fully auto versions -- they are not smuggled in across the river.\"\n \n Many of the fully automatic weapons that have been seized in Mexico cannot be found in the U.S., but they are not uncommon in the Third World.\n \n The Mexican government said it has seized 2,239 grenades in the last two years -- but those grenades and the rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) are unavailable in U.S. gun shops. The ones used in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey in October and a TV station in January were made in South Korea. Almost 70 similar grenades were seized in February in the bottom of a truck entering Mexico from Guatemala.\n \n \"Most of these weapons are being smuggled from Central American countries or by sea, eluding U.S. and Mexican monitors who are focused on the smuggling of semi-automatic and conventional weapons purchased from dealers in the U.S. border states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California,\" according to a report in the Los Angeles Times.\n \n Boatloads of Weapons\n \n So why would the Mexican drug cartels, which last year grossed between $17 billion and $38 billion, bother buying single-shot rifles, and force thousands of unknown \"straw\" buyers in the U.S. through a government background check, when they can buy boatloads of fully automatic M-16s and assault rifles from China, Israel or South Africa?\n \n Alberto Islas, a security consultant who advises the Mexican government, says the drug cartels are using the Guatemalan border to move black market weapons. Some are left over from the Central American wars the United States helped fight; others, like the grenades and launchers, are South Korean, Israeli and Spanish. Some were legally supplied to the Mexican government; others were sold by corrupt military officers or officials.\n \n The exaggeration of United States \"responsibility\" for the lawlessness in Mexico extends even beyond the \"90-percent\" falsehood -- and some Second Amendment activists believe it's designed to promote more restrictive gun-control laws in the U.S.\n \n In a remarkable claim, Auturo Sarukhan, the Mexican ambassador to the U.S., said Mexico seizes 2,000 guns a day from the United States -- 730,000 a year. That's a far cry from the official statistic from the Mexican attorney general's office, which says Mexico seized 29,000 weapons in all of 2007 and 2008.\n \n Chris Cox, spokesman for the National Rifle Association, blames the media and anti-gun politicians in the U.S. for misrepresenting where Mexican weapons come from.\n \n \"Reporter after politician after news anchor just disregards the truth on this,\" Cox said. \"The numbers are intentionally used to weaken the Second Amendment.\"\n \n \"The predominant source of guns in Mexico is Central and South America. You also have Russian, Chinese and Israeli guns. It's estimated that over 100,000 soldiers deserted the army to work for the drug cartels, and that ignores all the police. How many of them took their weapons with them?\"\n \n But Tom Diaz, senior policy analyst at the Violence Policy Center, called the \"90 percent\" issue a red herring and said that it should not detract from the effort to stop gun trafficking into Mexico.\n \n \"Let's do what we can with what we know,\" he said. \"We know that one hell of a lot of firearms come from the United States because our gun market is wide open.\"\n \n \n\n \n Close the border then Tommie...no drugs for U. We know \"one hell of a lot of drugs come from Mexico because the border is wide open\"! Drugs, illegal aliens, democrat voters....",

If the propaganda persists, we will have them whittled down to zero in the House and Senate. Lies have consequences. Imagine a world without BATF :) emoticon_xagree",
