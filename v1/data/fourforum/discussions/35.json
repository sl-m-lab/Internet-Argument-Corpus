There are strict measurements, due to environmentalists, that count the amount of trees harvested and the amount replanted. Rushes point in the poll is that the forest acreage is increasing in the United States. \n \n As far as the at the time the constitution is written goes, if we are looking at the same land mass then the answer is yes. Reforestation has brought us to the 700+ million acres. The 850million is an overestimate from a biased environmentalist source. More conservative estimates put the forests at approximately 600 million acres.\n \n Point being, forests ar on the increase. Environmentalist would have trees take precedence over people.",

However, the issue this points to is not the administration's lack of protection for forests but rather that the demand and need in this country for wood is not being met by this country. To address the environmental problem in this country without addressing the concommitant market issues only puts the country in the predicament of spending in other countries rather than at home.\n \n I think this actually makes a good case to reduce the regulation of forest land in the US. Then we could meet our own demand and supply the needs reducing the trade deficit. (not the federal deficit but the trade deficit).",

   "I am confused... do you mean the acreage of national forests? Of course that has increased since the writing of the constitution... Theodore Roosevelt created the National Parks program. Heck, we've gained how many states since Roosevelt?\n Do you mean just the acreage of forests in America? Well....Duh. At the time the constitution was written, american land itself was limited to that of the badly defined borders of the original colonies. This was long before the Louisiana purchase, the Gadsden purchase, the acquisition of Alaska..etc.\n Or do you mean the acraege of each specific forest, like say, the Pike National Forest? As far as I know, it did not exist back in the late 1700's, so technically, it's acreage has definitely increased since.\n Obviously all these numbers have increased enormously since the creation of the constitution, and the forest service from which the statistics are said to come from. I don't see how they could make such a statement, considering the above-named faults in such things.\n \n I am from Colorado, and have spent years in Montana, and have seen firsthand the effects of wildfire. In 2000, more than 1/5 of the forests in MT burned, In 2002 more than a half million acres burned in the Hayman fire, which was the largest wildfire in recorded CO history.\n What people don't seem to realize is that fire is an inevitable and indeed neccessary part of nature. The forest needs to burn every once in a while, it clears old undergrowth, and provides nutrients not found otherwise. \n One high powered republican in MT has decided the answer to wildfire is to thin trees to the point that there are five feet between trunks. I'm not so sure you could still call it a forest at that point, indeed, with such well measured intervals it would resemble an orchard.\n We are blessed in this country with some very skilled and very dedicated firefighters who deserve our respect and certainly more recognition. I think perhaps the money spent on \"thinning\" trees would be better spent in hiring and training more firefighters, not to mention increasing their fleet of machinery for the cause.\n Yes, there are some massively overgrown forests, but they are few and far between. Very likely they do need some attention, but we must be careful how far we go. Look at the redwood forests... oh wait... thats if you can find one. \n Just one example of man's attempt to control nature going too far.\n As much as we try, there is not much we can do if the fire wants to burn.\n Look at the Mississippi. How many federal dollars have been spent enlisting the Corps of Engineers to try and reroute its flow. And how many times has the river laughed at them?\n I am sorry for all those who have lost property in wildfires. But in the California fires, I was under the impression that these were the result of arsonists, just like the Hayman fire. (the Hayman fire was started by a forest service worker, who thought she could put it out herself and become a hero.) Are you going to cut down the forest because of that? That'd be like shutting down the malls to deter shoplifters.\n I would also like to make the proposal that perhaps people should leave the forests wild as they should be. Building a house next to a forest, and being surprised when there is a fire is silly.\n It's like building a house in Kilawea, Hawai'i, and then wondering why you have lava in the living room.\n People want to be close to nature, but then want to alter nature to fit their schedule. Sorry folks, nature doesnt like that. \n And it will always be one step ahead.",

   "Hey buddhaman, forest fires are neccessary so we should lettem burn, not train more forest fire fighters.\n\n \n \n You do not see the need for forest fire fighters? You think we should just let all the forests burn, huh?\n \n Yes, fire is a neccesary thing in nature. It does many wonderful things to the burned areas that could not be achieved any other way. It provides a renewal. But there is more to a forest than trees, my friend. Yes, the greenery will restore itself, will grow back. But the same thing cannot be said for all the other beauty of the forest. Spectacular rock formations that collapse in the intense heat. Diverse animal life that disperses or dies. How many hundreds of unknown species have been lost in forest fires?\n \n In the past four years, I have seen large pecentages of two states that I have lived in cestroyed by forest fires. A few years ago, Montana lost more than 1/5 of it's forests and open lands to fires. Amongst the areas damaged were parts of both Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks. That same long hot summer, Fire threatened the ruins at Mesa Verde National Monument. Yes, trees will grow back, but the Anasazi will not return to build more cliff dwellings. \n \n We need to take an active role in the world we live in, not just sit back in our chairs and say, \"lettem burn\" as you so eloquently put it. Nature is a spectacular thing that we should never get cocky enough to assume we can control it. But we can help it, we can try to guide it. We can try to limit the damage done by forest fires by controlling the blaze, directing it away from some of the treasures I for one hope my grandchildren may marvel at the same as I have done.\n \n We need more forest fire fighters, it is a fact. Two summers ago we had the largest forest fire in recorded colorado history. Because the blaze was so huge and out of control, we called in aid from other states. But what do you do when your own state catches fire, but all your best fire fighters are in Colorado? \n \n You can go ahead and take the stance that all of this loss in neccessary, and so decide that we should no nothing about it, but I will take the stance that we should do what we can, and let nature do the rest.",

We are told not to hunt them by the environmentalist/animal lovers but there is a large hunting constituent in the state that keeps hunting open, though bag limits are often reduced. However, if the deer herds are not properly trimmed by hunters, they will eat all of the available food during the winter and many will starve to death. Diseases and cars will also take a larger number with the increased herd size because of increased travel. So by taking small numbers of them at a time, the herds can be kept in check and mass deaths do not occur, as well as mass damage to personal property. \n \n Think about it and tell me what I am trying to tell you.",

Selective harvesting of trees generates jobs, revenue and is a much safer alternative.\n Just because forest fires started by lightning are \"natural\" doesn't mean that it's good for forests.",
