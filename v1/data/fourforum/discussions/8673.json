   "The following is a letter sent from the man who runs http://outsidepride.com/store/catalog/index.html to his newsletter recipients. (\"Outsidepride\" is a web-site for lawn care products.)\n \n =========================================================\n This is not your typical newsletter from Outsidepride.com, Inc. In fact, this is the first one in six years which is not business related. I apologize for cluttering your inbox with an unsolicited email; however you are free to unsubscribe just by clicking the link at the bottom. \n \n I want to share with you my television viewing experience the other night on prime time television. I ask those of you who agree with me to go to www.cbs.com and go to the bottom of the page, click the feedback link and express your opinion. I know the vast majority of you will agree with me as all polls indicate. We are the majority, not the minority as the liberal media would lead you to believe. \n \n My wife and I sat down to watch television the other night with our children. Cold Case was on which is normally a fairly enjoyable show to watch; however, the last half hour of the show dealt with a young man who wished he had asked his male friend to come with him (long story short). The show ended with the two men hugging and obvious intimation they had discovered their gay feelings towards each other. The very next show was Without A Trace. The whole last half hour of this show was about two lesbians who were struggling with their feelings of lesbianism. It ended with full acceptance from one father and the two lesbians making out. Yes, they were kissing right at the end of the show on public prime time television. So much for wholesome family television. \n \n Now, I am NOT trying to bash homosexuals and I am not a bigot; however, I feel homosexuality is morally wrong and should not be \"promoted\" as what is the norm for society. Text books are being rewritten as I am writing this to \"highlight\" every homosexual who has made a contribution to society. There are teachers who have been asked to make sure students know that, \"This person in history was a homosexual.\" History is being rewritten to promote homosexuality and prime time television is doing its best to make homosexuality a \"normal\" behavior. If homosexuality was the norm, civilization would have ceased to exist thousands of years ago. Procreation takes a man and a woman. There was Adam and then there was Eve, not Adam and Steve. \n \n There are literally tens of thousand of you reading this email right now. If you are tired of the way public television is going let CBS know! It will only take about 1 minute of your time. Again, just go to www.cbs.com and click the feedback link at the bottom. It is time the majority speak up and not let the minority run this country. The majority can bring back the Christian heritage this country was founded on because it is, \"In God We Trust.\" \n \n Thank you for your time, \n \n Troy Hake \n President \n Outsidepride.com, Inc.",

   "My message, to the producers of both programs:\n \n \"You are to applauded for your frank and compassionate portrayal of homosexuality. \n \n The reality of gay relationships needs to be shown truthfully. Too often the mainstream media shirks its responsibility to portray that truth honestly buy giving to pressure from superstition-subscribing, religion-based interest groups whose clear agenda is to transform our nation into a conformist theocracy that fears and rejects diversity and the facts of human sexuality, merely for the sake of the Almighty Buck. \n \n As the network of Ed Murrow, you do yourselves proud by not giving in to such bigotry. Bravo.\"",

   "The majority can bring back the Christian heritage this country was founded on because it is, \"In God We Trust.\" \n\n \n This line held an irony that stuck out in neon colors in my mind.\n The claim that this country was \"founded\" on Christian heritage, and giving \"In God We Trust\" as an example.\n \"In God We Trust\" is the national motto of the United States of America and the state motto of Florida. It was so designated by an act of Congress in 1956 and officially supersedes \"E Pluribus Unum\" (Out of Many, One) according to United States Code, Title 36, Section 302. President Eisenhower signed the resolution into law on 30 July 1956.[1]\n \n The final stanza of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key (and later adopted as the U.S. National Anthem), contains one of the earliest references to a variation of the phrase: \"...And this be our motto: \"In God is our trust.\"\n \n The most common place where the motto is observed in daily life is on the money of the United States. The first United States coin to bear this national motto was the 1864 two-cent piece. It first appeared on U.S. currency on the back of Florida National Bank Notes in 1863. It wasn't until 1957 that the motto was permanently adopted for use on United States currency.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_God_We_Trust\n \n And in case anybody wants to try to harp on \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in hopes of an earlier date closer to the \"founding\" of our country, here is its history as an official song...\n It was recognized for official use by the United States Navy (1889) and the White House (1916), and was made the national anthem by a Congressional resolution on 3 March 1931. Although the song has four stanzas, only the first is commonly sung today.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Spangled_Banner\n \n \n Maybe it's a minor gripe on my part, but I just saw it as par for the course as how the entire article was completely clueless on how things really are working and what he was really asking for...\n \n I ask you.\n If somebody demanded that television be devoid of any blacks or show of blacks in a positive light, would we not realize that they were speaking out of prejudice????\n \n It looks like it's very possible that nobody will contest that...",

   "Now, I am NOT trying to bash homosexuals and I am not a bigot; however, I feel homosexuality is morally wrong and should not be \"promoted\" as what is the norm for society. \n\n \n I object to the term \"promotion.\" How does one promote homosexuality, or heterosexuality for that matter? No one promotes it as the norm for society, if that is to mean the average. It is norm-al for a small percentage of society and as such need not need be spoken of disparagingly. That doesn't mean avoidance of the discussion of homosexuality altogether, which is what these guys would like to see, unless it is spoken of as something bad or immoral. We should be able to discuss the subject in neutral dispassionate language. \n \n Yes you are a bigot if you spread lies about a class of people in order to harm them, and if you prejudge an individual based upon these lies. If you think your religion has procscriptions against homosexuality, then use those terms specifically, such as \"my specific belief systems feels homosex is bad, and if I want to follow my specific belief system, I won't kiss boys\", instead of \"my specific belief systems feels homosex is bad, so y'all should to.\"",
