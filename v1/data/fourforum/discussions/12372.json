   "More on Reagan and his tax cuts which were the start of the present financial disaster worldwide:\n \nRonald Reagan may have been a good and decent man.\n \n As president, though, Reagan pursued policies that were short-sighted, reckless and, for many, hurtful. His economic legacy is one of deplorable disregard for the consequences of his actions, and the ramifications of Reagan's decisions remain with us to this day. ...\n \n On the matter of deficits, Reagan nearly tripled the gap between the amount of money the federal government took in and the amount it spent. He did this by cutting tax rates by an average 25 percent, while aggressively increasing defense spending.\n \n In 1981, shortly after taking office, Reagan lamented \"runaway deficits\" that were then approaching $80 billion, or about 2.5 percent of gross domestic product. Within only two years, however, his policies had succeeded in enlarging the deficit to more than $200 billion, or 6 percent of GDP.\n\n Downside of Reagan legacy\n \n American families lost their homes because Reagan's economic policies shipped their jobs overseas while Reagan was cutting taxes for the very, very rich.\n \n The very, very rich became very, very much more richer while the average American became jobless and homeless.",

   "Tax Revenue went up under Reagan. It was the spending that blew the deficit to the moon. However, the net result was that we outspent the Russians and caused their eventual collapse.\n \n \n \n \n \n The Historical Lessons of Lower Tax Rates\n \n The Reagan tax cuts\n Thanks to \"bracket creep,\" the inflation of the 1970s pushed millions of taxpayers into higher tax brackets even though their inflation-adjusted incomes were not rising. To help offset this tax increase and also to improve incentives to work, save, and invest, President Reagan proposed sweeping tax rate reductions during the 1980s. What happened? Total tax revenues climbed by 99.4 percent during the 1980s, and the results are even more impressive when looking at what happened to personal income tax revenues. Once the economy received an unambiguous tax cut in January 1983, income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for inflation).\n According to then-U.S. Representative Jack Kemp (R-NY), one of the chief architects of the Reagan tax cuts:\n At some point, additional taxes so discourage the activity being taxed, such as working or investing, that they yield less revenue rather than more. There are, after all, two rates that yield the same amount of revenue: high tax rates on low production, or low rates on high production.",

   "The true history of the mortgage crisis:\n \nThe origins of this credit crunch-maybe even a crisis-reside, by all accounts, in the housing market. Big banks bought up a lot of sub-prime mortgages, then bundled them into portfolios that could be sold downstream as reliably income-producing assets. Thus mortgage debt was \"securitized,\" made into something hedge funds and private equity firms, and even stodgy mutual funds, could buy into as an investment, not as a side bet. When the housing market flattened out, that is, when prices and construction began to fall and when foreclosure rates began to rise over the last two years-even with interest rates relatively steady-this mortgage debt suddenly looked dubious.\n \n The bubble burst, in short, when everybody realized that the long-term inflation of residential real estate prices, which started about a decade ago, was over, maybe even in Manhattan.\n \n Our questions should then be, why did this huge investment in subprime mortgages take place, and why should dismal forecasts on the housing/mortgage market affect all others? The short answer to the first question is George W. Bush's tax cuts-and this answer should give the Democratic candidates another reason to repeal them. \n \n The rationale for these cuts came from the supply-side arguments of the 1980s (personified by Dick Cheney).  It goes like this. Investment, productivity, and employment will increase if you augment the incomes of those who do the saving and investing. These already wealthy folks will acquire a new monetary incentive to invest in goods production if you raise their disposable incomes by cutting their taxes. That investment will in turn produce larger payrolls and more taxable incomes, thus canceling the revenue-reducing effect of the original tax cuts.\n\n The Housing Crisis: Caused by the Bush Tax Cuts\n \n Um, so where did the present economic crisis originate?",

   "The role of George Walker Bush in the mortgage crisis:\n \nWhite House Philosophy Stoked Mortgage Bonfire\n .... WASHINGTON - The global financial system was teetering on the edge of collapse when President Bush and his economics team huddled in the Roosevelt Room of the White House for a briefing that, in the words of one participant, \"scared the hell out of everybody.\"\n \n It was Sept. 18. Lehman Brothers had just gone belly-up, overwhelmed by toxic mortgages. Bank of America had swallowed Merrill Lynch in a hastily arranged sale. Two days earlier, Mr. Bush had agreed to pump $85 billion into the failing insurance giant American International Group.\n \n .... Henry M. Paulson Jr., told him that to stave off disaster, he would have to sign off on the biggest government bailout in history.\n \n Mr. Bush, according to several people in the room, paused for a single, stunned moment to take it all in.\n \n \"How,\" he wondered aloud, \"did we get here?\"\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/business/21admin.html\n \n Next: How Did We Get Here?",

   "How Bush participated in the mortgage meltdown:\n \nBut the story of how we got here is partly one of Mr. Bush's own making, according to a review of his tenure that included interviews with dozens of current and former administration officials.\n \n From his earliest days in office, Mr. Bush paired his belief that Americans do best when they own their own home with his conviction that markets do best when let alone.\n \n He pushed hard to expand homeownership, especially among minorities, an initiative that dovetailed with his ambition to expand the Republican tent - and with the business interests of some of his biggest donors. But his housing policies and hands-off approach to regulation encouraged lax lending standards.\n \n Mr. Bush did foresee the danger posed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage finance giants. The president spent years pushing a recalcitrant Congress to toughen regulation of the companies, but was unwilling to compromise when his former Treasury secretary wanted to cut a deal. And the regulator Mr. Bush chose to oversee them - an old prep school buddy - pronounced the companies sound even as they headed toward insolvency.\n \n As early as 2006, top advisers to Mr. Bush dismissed warnings from people inside and outside the White House that housing prices were inflated and that a foreclosure crisis was looming. And when the economy deteriorated, Mr. Bush and his team misdiagnosed the reasons and scope of the downturn; as recently as February, for example, Mr. Bush was still calling it a \"rough patch.\"\n \n The result was a series of piecemeal policy prescriptions that lagged behind the escalating crisis.\n\n From the article cited in the previous post.\n \n Bush and his people ignored the dangers of easy lending practices, which could have been easily remedied by governance and regulation. Instead, as noted by Bush's former Secretary of the Treasury, John W. Snow:\n \n\"The Bush administration took a lot of pride that homeownership had reached historic highs,\" Mr. Snow said in an interview. \"But what we forgot in the process was that it has to be done in the context of people being able to afford their house. We now realize there was a high cost.\"\n",

The socialist president we had known as FDR and his \"New Deal\" was nothing more than broke socialism, it drug the great depression into a greater depression, and took 10 years to clear through a majority of it; and if not for the extra-mitigating factor of WWII we would would have not pulled out of it, how is it you nutters and your something for nothing ideals and false sense of entitlement evaded the very basic radar of the perspicuity in mathematic reason. \n \n Not vetting the \"value\" of your ideals as a whole to a people who know better... in the market place of the free exchange of ideas [note: I didn't say ideals] but resort to baser tactics and leverage in this case, then \"we the people\" become victims. No wonder you humanists have a warped sense of the value human life - you'd have to... to keep treating people like lab rats! Do you not understand that by taxing people's income excessively taxes their motivations to innovate robs our nation of novation, and the opportunity to gow... because I don't know if anyone ever told you this... the fed cannot make people stay in business to their financial dismay, if they loose the economic impetus to be in busniness... they close their doors, so what then? When we have looted the nation of prosperity, and grew the size of government to the point where it simply cannot be maintained as it is has never succeeded here, France... Nazi Germany, Post war Germany - or any emerging markets such as India and Korea. For crying out loud... look at California, they have the most wasteful spending in the nation, 44 Billion in the hole... and these liberals won't reduce wasteful spending, as a matter of fact they are actively trying to grow the government even in a shortfall. That ought to tell you what kind of minds you're certainly not dealing right there, but I suppose that wouldn't make a difference to you at all.\n \n \n Wasteful spending on idealogical bents rather nations defense and proper educational spending, and reasonable infrastructure allocations have no place in budgetary strata yet they persist because of lofty macchinations... do you really expect us to laden our children and our children's children with this debt. Reagan's tax cuts grew the economy because people know how to spend their money better than the government, lefts in government don't like this because capitalist progress derails a socialist agenda to the obstruct and impeded where they can... that alone is a whole other set of problems, but Reagan won the intellectual argument and proved it. Every nut bucket liberal that gets their way on a spending bill ends up draining out ability to respond to correction when the bottom starts to fall out of our markets. History has proven this... From Reagan inheriting Jimmy Carters debauched and grossly mismanaged administration. Our constitutional framers were especially worried about this and made provisions for it that get ignored by liberals on a regular basis, and I must admit by a few fortune seeking Republicans here and then, but the difference is accountability - liberals reject it entirely because I guess we shouldn't expect people with double minds not to have double standards.\n \n \n \n -That Darn Republican",

   "ROTFLMAO. I SERIOUSLY doubt that Obvious Child fled from that. FAR, FAR more likely he felt that a list of \"conservative vs liberal\" values written by a couple of high school students was just too stupid to be worthy of commenting on. I am afraid he is right. \n\n \n Or he may have thought that simply poisoning wells without paying much attention to what it actually says wouldn't have worked too well, because he would have known that I would have asked for something from another source that contradicts it. We would then have compared the two to how mainstream, high profile political debates go today. \n \n Here is the post he never responded to, from this thread. As I said in that post, there are accepted standards for what liberal and conservative means. When debates happen on CNN, Fox News, talk radio, there is seldom any question about what the two terms mean. \n \n You've always posted here as a godless libertarian for the most part. Part of your strategy has been to try to make yourself look more \"conservative\" than those in the Republican party (or the media)who claim the title, thereby making them look worse than Democrats. Using the Iraq war with Bush as president, you were able to BS your way through that with a small amount of success in the minds of a few. But that's over now! You could ignore the posts of flaming liberals like Simone and Chester before because you could act like the sitting president was taking all your attention. It's gone now, yet you still wink and nod at flaming liberals posts, while continuing to take exception to posts from actual conservatives. There are a few more conservatives at 4forums now than when Bush was president, and a few less liberals - it's only natural. If you think high school students writing about conservative vs liberal values is stupid, you really ought to try to imagine how stupid it looks when adults like yourself call Bill Clinton a conservative, or George Bush a liberal. \n \n \n \nWhile their \"core beliefs\" at the top of the page are more or less correct (and plagiarized), \n\n \n Where did they plagiarize them from? Was there a copyright infringment? \n \n \n....their take on conservative and liberal beliefs on individual issues leaves much to be desired...which is why we do not take the word of high school students on things like that. \n\n \n Whose word should we take? One who calls Bill Clinton a conservative? \n \n \n \n They are probably young enough that they do not even REMEMBER the last time we had a conservative president in the white house (It was Bush Sr). \n\n \n They could have studied history from accurate sources - it could have put them far beyond many over-40 voters today in political knowledge. \n \n \nFor example, on gay marriage, traditinal conservatives recognize that the federal government has no place in the debate AT ALL because there is nothing in the constitution that would imply at ANY LEVEL that the federal government has the power to set standards for things like marriage. It is an issue for the states. That is why bigamy survived in Utah for so long...they had to wait for the state to change their laws because the CONSERVATIVES on the federal side did not see it as an issue for the federal government. \n\n \n CAF\u00c9 standards for automobiles aren't in the constitution either, yet the federal government is heavily involved in them. Same with marijuana usage. All political views wish the federal government would abandon some things and not others. \n Conservatism is about more than just the constitution and spending, it's about the entire spectrum of human behavior. It's largely about morals and tradition, about resistance to any sudden change in the established order. Any non gradual, non market forced change. Conservatives opposition of gay marriage is exactly as the above high school students described it. \n \n \nThe list written by a high school student?? Sorry. Not impressed. Do you have something from a reputable source? Preferably somebody who has been through puberty?\n\n \n Nope - waiting for yours. Find me something that clashes with that, and we'll see if it's as accurate as that one is, in describing what is actually going on in U.S. political debates today.

That brought on that ##### Caribou Barbie to appeal to the religious right and she DID...to the tune of 90+% support, but by election day she only had the support of about 20% of traditional conservatives.\n \n During the Bush years they elevated the religious right in importance because frankly they were the only people that showed Bush any support at all as things got bad and it became clear that pretty much everything he had done in office was a terrible mistake, and much of it was probably a felony. Republican leadership got so used to dealing with JUST that 30% or so that supported him that they seem to have forgotten that you cannot win an election with 30% of the people...no matter how hard they pray.

I have explained it in terms that even a small child should be able to understand in the past. I do believe my dog understands my argument by now.

   "\n To some \"highly evolved life-form\" like you, it may actually sound like you know what your talking about. But... to anyone else who can just simply observe what has transpired, you're out of your mind. You can't track a \"CRA\" loan, CRA were lending rules not a catagory! You have to track the trends the rules create... which were quite visible - and if you knew anything about finance, you'd know this, it is clear you do not... so I'd put a sock in it if I were you trying to act a if you are bringing something viable to this debate thread... other than gross speculation and prognostication. Lenders only loan what's available, and thanks to the leverage brought down by Talbot, Franks, Dodd.. and his live in lover at Fannie Mae, this is what was available - and hence the seeds of what we have now, mild chaos. \n\n \n You, sir, are clueless.\n \n FRB: Survey of CRA-Related Lending\n \n \nSection 713 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-102) directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to study and report to the Congress on the default rates, delinquency rates, and profitability of lending activities undertaken in conformance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA). The Board was directed to make the report and supporting data available to the public.\n\n \n You can download the results of the latest survey at that page.\n \n Rethink your foolish comments on leverage brought down by blah blah blah as well. \n \n \n \nDo I have to remind you who has majority control of the senate and the house... give it a rest. TARP was drafted by Gietner and the Dems... to blame it on Bush is just partisan bull #### on your behalf. Bush only signed what was pared down, with emmense wrangling on the right side of the isle... apparently you have a hole in your noggin and this little bit of reality slipped through it.\n\n \n This is a LIE. TARP was drafted by Geithner and PAULSON. The democrats modified 2 portions. First, they split the $700 billion into 2 chunks instead of giving it all as a lump sum. Second, they added an oversight element that the original bill, as submitted and signed by paulson, did not include.\n \n Is this just lack of knowledge on your part, dishonesty, or trolling. I have noticed that Chester has not been posting much lately and cant help but wonder if \"Darn Republican\" is not a troll account he has set up to make republicans look like ignorant rednecks. \n \n \n \n\n Hey, I won't argue Bush's huge spending... but he didn't appropriate 1.3 + trillion is earmarks and pork during his entire tenure... nice try though, misguided... but nice try. Brobama just wallet jacked the next two generations in debt. If people know not to spend when things cool off... how is it [as messianic as he may feel he is between his ears] thinks he can but his way out of a recession? Fact is you don't spend your way out of debt when you're broke... people know how to spend better that the fed does, and that is where the spending out to take place - the people no the state.\n\n \n I dont disagree. The spending is immense. Increasing taxes to pay for it is still a responsible move, and you still have not given an example of one of these \"Virulent tax penalties\". \n \n \n \nOnly a reprobate intellect would consider that idiotic... but here, let's remind you.

The new deal was instituted in 1933 and immediately had a positive impact on employment and GDP growth. Look at an actual timeline of the depression. The economy hit bottom as the new deal came into being and every year after that until WW II we had double digit GDP growth. \n \n More recently, Reagan used MASSIVE government spending to provide artificial growth stimulus to the economy during his time in office, and Bush used MASSIVE government spending to help nullify the impact of the dot com bust and subsequent recession.\n \n There is absolutely no question whatsoever that government spending spurs economic growth. The problem is that you cannot keep that spending up forever, and once it goes away you have one hell of a problem. We saw this when Bush Sr was in office...he had to increase taxes because we could no longer afford to keep up Reagans foolish fiscal policies. Clinton was left to deal with most of that fallout, but luckily the dot com bubble came along and provided a massive, though temporary, boost to the economy which mitigated the impact. \n \n The housing bubble grew out of the dot come bubble and Greenspan and Bushs INCREDIBLY irresponsible fiscal policies. Now we are stuck trying to pay the piper, but the bill is probably more than we can possibly afford. \n \n In my personal estimation, the current spending on top of the past spending is probably going to break the US as a country. The US essentially operates within a \"Just in Time\" financing model. Not only can we not afford to operate without borrowing more money, we cannot even afford to service our current debt without continous loans from foreign investors. It is quite literally a ponzi scheme. \n \n Until the inevitable collapse, when we lose the ability to borrow enough money to stay afloat and keep our spending programs going, the continued spending WILL boost our GDP. It is foolish to think otherwise. \n \n \n\n Its funny how liberals project... no capitalist is ignorant to what socialism is. But, I'll add this opinion... no American needs to.

You didn't discredit what my source said, you gave your opinion on one small part of it, but your main issue was to discredit something about it that was separate from what it said, by attacking the authors age. It was a classice example of a logical fallacy. \n \n \nThere is certainly a logical fallacy here, but you are the one making it. This entire thing is an appeal to authority. The problem is that not only is an appeal to authority a logical fallacy, but in this case your authority is a high school kid, so you look like a fool. \n\n \n No, it was a source, not the claim of an unquestionable authority. I chose it as a source simply because it was the first, (and apparantly one of the few) brief, concise descriptions of political divisions that logically agrees with what we actually see in high level political debates today. The National Journal (claiming non partisanship) rates national politicians according to how they vote. They don't seem to make clear just how they do it, but it's safe to say that politicians that are the least tolerant of gay marriage are given conservative ratings. It's also safe to say that the NJ's ratings go along very closely with the \"high school\" source that I used. \n \n \nReally? Then where did the term \"neoconservative\" come from? I hear it constantly on the news when they talk about different factions in the Republican party. \n\n \n It's a somewhat mild name calling term for those considered to be extremly conservative, but has no bearing on the generally accepted terms of liberal vs. conservative. You've never heard anyone in a high profile debate give Bill Clinton an overall conservative rating, or called him more conservative than George Bush - they would be laughed off the air. \n \n \nI wonder if maybe that is because CAFE standards VERY CLEARLY fall within Congress mandate to regulate interstate commerce? You do realize that just because the constitution does not include the term \"Cafe Standards for Automobiles\" that does not make them unconstitutional as long as they fall withing the powers granted to congress, right? \n\n \n It was explained to me in post #55, yes. I realize that if one uses one's imagination, does enough twisting and bending, one can take the word \"commerce\" and twist it into the words \"personal transportation\", thereby making the constitution say anything one wants it to say. Chester does that - he's a conservative, right? \n \n \nIf you actually want to debate the point we can. We have in the past and you have lost BADLY. I mean, embarrassingly badly...you really did look like a total fool. \n\n \n Yes, I remember it - hard to believe it's been almost 4 years now. Who the fool was, was made very clear in posts 27 and 29. \n \n \n \n If you want to repeat that we can, but be forewarned that no REASONABLE person is going to give any weight at all to the unsupported editorial you posted here.\n \n In act, if you want, I debate at another site that has a formal debate forum that is judged by several national debate champions. If you would like we could set up a debate there so you can have the depth of your foolishness on this issue and your complete and total lack of logic explained to you by some of the best debaters on the planet.\n\n \n Are any of these champions are U.S. citizens?

In short you could say it is the attitude behind the bill (well really congress in general) that transferred to the banks. I think at best the CRA was a product of the underlying problem and not a cause because, like you said, the act didn't really do much.\n \n \nThis is a LIE. TARP was drafted by Geithner and PAULSON. The democrats modified 2 portions. First, they split the $700 billion into 2 chunks instead of giving it all as a lump sum. Second, they added an oversight element that the original bill, as submitted and signed by paulson, did not include.\nDarn Republican needs to learn that republicans and democrats only have one difference...their name. Both sides were competing to cause this latest crisis the fastest. \n \n In the end congress is the one that passes these things and the buck stops with them. Darn republican makes a good point that it was a democratic congress and anyone who voted for it should be held accountable for being an #####. What Darn republican fails to see is that many republicans voted for it...apparently we only have 20 good senators (probably an overstatement). \n \n \n\n I dont disagree. The spending is immense. Increasing taxes to pay for it is still a responsible move, and you still have not given an example of one of these \"Virulent tax penalties\". \nNot only is it a responsible move, it is basically a required move. But you can't stop there...cutting spending and raising taxes is the only solution to our federal budget problem. I've reviewed our financials numerous times over the past decade and we are down to this last option. In fact, now might be the best time to do it. You can blame the economic fallout on the recession as opposed to the terrible fiscal policies of the last half century.\n \n \n\n Except that is not true. The new deal was instituted in 1933 and immediately had a positive impact on employment and GDP growth. Look at an actual timeline of the depression. The economy hit bottom as the new deal came into being and every year after that until WW II we had double digit GDP growth. \nI'm not sure this is entirely true....because I didn't read the rest of your paragraph...\n \n\n More recently, Reagan used MASSIVE government spending to provide artificial growth stimulus to the economy during his time in office, and Bush used MASSIVE government spending to help nullify the impact of the dot com bust and subsequent recession.\n \n There is absolutely no question whatsoever that government spending spurs economic growth.

Bureau of Economic Analysis\n Compensation from before World War I through the Great Depression\n \n As anyone can plainly see, GDP did go up during the New Deal time but tanked right afterwards. Unemployment did roughly the same thing. Now some people claim this causes a prolonged depression and in some respect the are correct but I understand your point of view that it really masked the depression. In short, it delayed as opposed to prolonged...delaying it was only as successful as the amount of money you put in. \n \n \nThe housing bubble grew out of the dot come bubble and Greenspan and Bushs INCREDIBLY irresponsible fiscal policies. Now we are stuck trying to pay the piper, but the bill is probably more than we can possibly afford. \n \n In my personal estimation, the current spending on top of the past spending is probably going to break the US as a country.

   "Poisoning the well means \"discrediting the sources used by your opponent\". \nYou didn't discredit what my source said, you gave your opinion on one small part of it, but your main issue was to discredit something about it that was separate from what it said, by attacking the authors age. It was a classice example of a logical fallacy. \n\n \n Wrong.\n \n Fallacy: Poisoning the Well\n \n This sort of \"reasoning\" involves trying to discredit what a person might later claim by presenting unfavorable information (be it true or false) about the person. This \"argument\" has the following form:\n \n 1. Unfavorable information (be it true or false) about person A is presented.\n 2. Therefore any claims person A makes will be false. \n \n This sort of \"reasoning\" is obviously fallacious. The person making such an attack is hoping that the unfavorable information will bias listeners against the person in question and hence that they will reject any claims he might make. However, merely presenting unfavorable information about a person (even if it is true) hardly counts as evidence against the claims he/she might make. This is especially clear when Poisoning the Well is looked at as a form of ad Homimem in which the attack is made prior to the person even making the claim or claims. The following example clearly shows that this sort of \"reasoning\" is quite poor. \n\n \n Marc, I took debate for 7 years. I know what poisoning the well is, and I know that if your opponent catches you doing it it is worth 20 points...10 for the fallacy, 10 for the ad hominem attack. \n \n Your reliance on this page, written by high school students, is an appeal to false authority. There is nothing at all to indicate, and it is HIGHLY unlikely that, these kids are qualified in any way to comment on these issues besides publishing their OPINIONS, which are worthless as factual debate material. \n \n \nNo, it was a source, not the claim of an unquestionable authority. I chose it as a source simply because it was the first, (and apparantly one of the few) brief, concise descriptions of political divisions that logically agrees with what we actually see in high level political debates today. The National Journal (claiming non partisanship) rates national politicians according to how they vote. They don't seem to make clear just how they do it, but it's safe to say that politicians that are the least tolerant of gay marriage are given conservative ratings. It's also safe to say that the NJ's ratings go along very closely with the \"high school\" source that I used. \n\n \n MArx, I dont care if it the first, the 15th, or the 157th result that came up. It is an opinion piece written by a high school kid. You look like a fool trying to use it as proof of anything. \n \n \nIt's a somewhat mild name calling term for those considered to be extremly conservative, but has no bearing on the generally accepted terms of liberal vs. conservative. You've never heard anyone in a high profile debate give Bill Clinton an overall conservative rating, or called him more conservative than George Bush - they would be laughed off the air. \n\n \n Wrong. The term \"neoconservative\" actually has a definition and refers to a defined group of republicans. Originally Neocons were democrats who crossed party lines to attempt to guide our foreign policy toward using military means to right what they saw as social injustice and to usher in what they saw as a new age of American Supremacy where we use our awesome military might to impose their social vision on the world. It was similar to Republicans crossing party lines in the south in an attempt to influence democratic party direction...which is where the descriptive term \"southern democrat\" comes from....they are conservative democrats who are a remnant of republican influence on the party. \n \n Irving Kristol was the founder of the modern neoconservative movement, and when he died his son took the reigns and founded the Weekly Standard and the Project for a New American Century, which was a group that was designed to solidify and advance the neoconservative agenda. Most of Bushs cabinet memebers were also PNAC members. \n \n \n \nIt was explained to me in post #55, yes. I realize that if one uses one's imagination, does enough twisting and bending, one can take the word \"commerce\" and twist it into the words \"personal transportation\", thereby making the constitution say anything one wants it to say. Chester does that - he's a conservative, right? \n\n \n You do realize that CAFE has been tested in the courts and found to be constitutional, right?? Prior to the rollout of CAFE standards, states were rolling out their own emissions and auto safety standards and there was a VERY REAL possibility that it was going to destroy the auto industry because the cost of making different models for different states was enormous. The federal government stepped in and essentially put an end to it by establishing nationwide manufacturing standards for automakers. It is WELL within their powers to do so. \n \n It has been argued that CAFE standard MIGHT not apply to vehicles manufactured in a particular state for use ONLY in that state. To argue that, though, you get into whether or not congress actually has the constitional power under the commerce clause to set environmental standards, which has also been tested in the courts. \n \n Frankly, things like CAFE and environmental standards are EXACTLY what congress was created for. They impact the entire nation, not just the state in question, and it is impossible to regulate them at the state level effectively. \n \n \nYes, I remember it - hard to believe it's been almost 4 years now. Who the fool was, was made very clear in posts 27 and 29. \n\n \n Yep. I got busy with a flood. Foolish me. Honestly, I probably screwed up by conceding, and several people PM'd me to say so. I should have gone back with a one liner along the lines of \"Your entire response was nothing but hyperbole, so there is no substance to respond to\". I just felt that would be disrespectful...even if it was true. \n \n I was referring to debating the \"who is a liberal and who is a conservative\". We have done it before, you looked like an #####.\n \n \nAre any of these champions are U.S. citizens? How many of them are from the middle east? emoticon_confused\n\n \n Hmmm...where are national debate champions from.....\n \n They are all American.

In short you could say it is the attitude behind the bill (well really congress in general) that transferred to the banks. I think at best the CRA was a product of the underlying problem and not a cause because, like you said, the act didn't really do much.\n\n \n If it did anything at all. The CRA results in the issuance of a CRA score for your bank. The theory was that making the CRA score for your banks public would cause consumers to lean on the banks to increase their local community lending. \n \n Do you know what the CRA score of your bank is? Me neither. \n \n\n In the end congress is the one that passes these things and the buck stops with them. Darn republican makes a good point that it was a democratic congress and anyone who voted for it should be held accountable for being an #####. What Darn republican fails to see is that many republicans voted for it...apparently we only have 20 good senators (probably an overstatement). \n\n \n Yes and no. I think there is something to be said for the fact that when the treasury secretary comes to you and says \"Pass this or our economy will collapse and there will be blood in the streets by the end of the week\", you act. \n \n At the same time, you would think they would have learned that signing off on things the Bush administration gave them without SERIOUS research and debate is a BAD idea. \n \n \nNot only is it a responsible move, it is basically a required move. But you can't stop there...cutting spending and raising taxes is the only solution to our federal budget problem. I've reviewed our financials numerous times over the past decade and we are down to this last option. In fact, now might be the best time to do it. You can blame the economic fallout on the recession as opposed to the terrible fiscal policies of the last half century.\n\n \n Exactly. I cant get over the fact that there are still people arguing against raising taxes. When your creditors are demanding assurances on your debt, you have problems. What are we going to do? Give them a title to Florida and Alaska to hold?? \n \n Sadly the baby boomers just dont get it. They have stolen everything from the next couple of generations. There is nothing left to steal. Now we have to actually start PAYING for stuff. \n \n \nThe second the new deal ended GDP went down and unemployment went up. \n \n U.S. Department of Commerce. Bureau of Economic Analysis\n Compensation from before World War I through the Great Depression\n \n As anyone can plainly see, GDP did go up during the New Deal time but tanked right afterwards. Unemployment did roughly the same thing. Now some people claim this causes a prolonged depression and in some respect the are correct but I understand your point of view that it really masked the depression. In short, it delayed as opposed to prolonged...delaying it was only as successful as the amount of money you put in. \n\n \n Exactly. The idea, though, that massive government spending does not boost GDP, though, is just foolish. That would be like claiming that putting $100 in your hand would not increase the amount of money in your hand. Now, if I put $100 in your hand every week and you count on that to eat and then I stop, you have a problem. \n \n \nTook the words right out of my mouth. I've been saying to my friends for since Madoff that the largest ponzi scheme is the US federal government. We pay off one credit card with the next.\n\n \n What gets me is that even people who are well versed in economics are willing to admit it is a ponzi scheme, but unwilling to admit that it will inevitably come crashing down. Ponzi schemes are by definition self limiting. \n \n \n Of course...GDP is calculated use government spending.\n\n \n You get the gold star for today for showing an understanding of addition and subtraction. It really says something about our education system when you end up handing out gold stars for simple math, but that seems to be where we are.",

   "\n No... it is the truth.. and wouldn't ever lie about this. You have an error in your fact checking, that suits your bent. Paulson and Bush were the only two nuts on the bandwagon from the center-right perspective to side with it, and Paulson was on board after TARP was vetted, but the news stories all collaborate that, look.. it is what it is. \n\n \n Ahhh...so the only republicans that supported it were the ones who drafted it an pushed it through. \n \n \n \nThat much was true... after enogh heat from the public, there had to be some accountability in it, but it wasn't there nor authored by any democrat initially. You need seriously seek help buddy... don't look over here, I don't need to revise history because the ideals I ally myself with usually fail anyway.\n \n Don't accuse peopel fo thing and your research isn't up to snuff... we are a;; privy to the same acedemics - its just how you want to present it. I present all of it, you present what you can control... they have a word for that, propaganda.\n\n \n Pelosi injected the oversight. You are possibly the only person I have seen refer to pelosi as a republican. Is it a closet kind of thing? \n \n \nI gave you one... if you don't think penalizing the wealth builders of our society with unjustifiable tax increases such as Brobama's proposed tightening of the capital gain tax, increasing FICA taxes, and still consider cap-and-trade, you're blind... or a socialist.\n\n \n OR not mentally retarded. None of those are unjustifiable, nor are they any kind of penlty. If we are going to have government, we have to have taxes. That is the way it works. \n \n For the nation to survive, we need a 50% across the board tax increase IMMEDIATLY and we need to cut federal spending by close to 60%. Any tax increase at this point is a GOOD thing and a step in the right direction. \n \n \n \nOk, now I know you're sippin cool aid now... there is a book just released called: FDR - New Deal or Raw Deal - At the time of the enactment of FDR's disingenuous spending spree... the League of Nations published employment statistics. The US had 1.5% the rest of the world has similar +/- .05%. By 1938 just before the war... we had 19% unemployment and the rest of the world had 11% comparatively. We had to keep hiking taxes to pay for the spending... then when when unemployment went us, they had to repeat the cycle in a sick sea-saw of sorts.\n \n Even the most rabid, foaming at the mouth Marxist Jedi Accountant... wouldn't go there. The New Deal was nothing but old socialism and there is nothing more to it. They all acknowledge [except for a few lone nuts] that the policies were not stabilizing the economy.... just protracting the recession. We call that failure... you may call it a beta test.\n\n \n Steeeeve posts the actual numbers above. You are not only wrong, you are dead wrong. \n \n \n\n Yes, reagan did have to shuffle the deck for a bit to offset Carter's enormous debt.... but the spending was a) temoral b) offset by the most productive tax incentives in recent memory and the dems are just singing sour grapes.\n\n \n That spending lasted through his entire presidency and was absolutely and without question the cause of the economic growth during the regan era. The Reagan tax cuts, if anything, had a negative impact. \n \n \n \nThat is a lie... what you meant to say was there is no question whether or not spending increases the size of government... then you'd ger a rousing, sure I agree... and that has been played out empically so I see you as nothign but shadow boxing a point that you could never win. Big government is not what we do here... in America.\n\n \n No, that is simple math. Government spending is a component of GDP. Increase it, and you increase GDP. Target it to high flow through industries and not only do you increase GDP you get to add a flow through multiplier to it (the number of times that the money gets counted for GDP purposes during the course of the year). That is also how we know that Reagans deficits were 100% responsible for growth. We just take his defiict spending, apply a flow through multiplier to it, and BOOM, there is all his growth. \n \n \nAlright.. alright, now you're going too far far... I was actually financially involved with tech companies during the tech \"bubble\" went a bursting and have a fair deal of intricate knowledge about what the contributing factors were and what what made it burst... don't do mixing you dish water with your rinse water here. The two had nothing to do with each other... though similar contributing human factors were involved, they were not the same buddy, get your history and your market data straight. \n\n \n I owned 3 dot com companies...legal cash harvesting scams, and you are wrong. Not only are you wrong, you apparently do not know enough abotu the economy to actually stop and THINK about this.\n \n The housing bubble started in 1996. That is when home values departed from their traditional relationship to incomes and inflation. People were using their new found (and false) dot com wealth to buy houses, and were driving up prices. In fact, if you look at local data home prices originally departed from traditional valuations in tech heavy area. The run up in housing prices EXACTLY mirrored the dot com spike as equity investors started using THEIR new found wealth to upgrade their homes. \n \n When the dot come bubble burst, housing prices started to fall. The federal reserve dumped interest rates to 1%, which was a negative real rate, in order to \"lessen the blow\" of the dot com failure as well as to ensure the housing market remained stable. \n \n So, yes, the housing bubble was a direct result of the dot com bubble, and once again you dont seem to have a clue what you are talking about. When you say you were financially involved in some dot come companies, does that mean you were one of the investors that lost your butt??\n \n \nIf what you say is true... then what are the markets failing to respond, I'll you. Government spending cannot be the GDP of an industrial powerhouse... its weakness... government largess can not and will not fix this, it didn't before, it won't now.\n\n \n \n Except we are not talking about \"fixing\" anything here. We were talking about stimulating growth. The two are not the same thing. If we want to FIX things we need to cut federal spending to the bone and increase taxes DRAMATICALLY. It may be less painful to just default on our debt, become a third world country, and then rebuild from there. \n \n \nNationalized health care, then closing valuable tax credit to pay for it... there's one. You should have saw than one. Need you be reminded that nearly 40% of American's don't pay taxes... so where's the \"credit\" coming from? Looks like fantasy math to me, addition by subtraction.\n\n \n Nationalized health care does not take money from the middle class and give it to the wealthy. If it did, it would not work. Look at nations that actually HAVE nationalized health care. What they do is essentially take the wealthy out of the health care industry. There are no CEOs of HMOs taking home $400 million per year in Canada. Why? Because there are no HMOs. \n \n Most of the money spent in nationalized systems ends up in the pockets of (in this order):\n \n Doctors\n Hospitals\n \n As opposed to the US system, where over 45% of the money that goes to health care ends up in an insurance companies pocket. \n \n \n Did you have another example...maybe one that actually works?",

Here we have a model that does not reward the nation with economic growth for excessive taxation. Lower taxes means greater capital to infuse into markets. More taxation means less to spend - it's really rather simply, but perhaps even that flies under the liberal radar.\n\n \n We have already done the spending. Now we have to pay for it. This is not complicated. Nor is it clear that the excess capital that ends up in peoples hands actually ends up spurring growth because while it does end up in markets which may have an impact on secondary market equity values (causing a bubble). It does not typically impact base economic growth however because that is primary market stuff, and the $1000 you may or may not save on your taxes is not even enough to get your foot in the door on a primary market investment. \n \n \n \nThat is the most partisan knee-jerk response yet... sure, go a head if you want to fund every little nutter special interest wish list. But if you want to grow this economy which is actually more fear enduced that actually stiffled... we need to induce spending, and attract companies to employ, and that in turn attracts people to spend... reducing the unemployments rolls, and getting eople to spend their descetioanry income - we won't be out of this until that happens.

Fund ever special interest wish list? Did you miss the part where I said \"cut spending by 60%\"? \n \n And that is not a knee jerk reaction. That is a mathematical fact. As of last year our debt service cost exceeded $500 billion per year. That essentially moved our debt to the \"self sustaining\" category (and that is WITHOUT the ludicrous stimulus and bailout spending). When you factor in declining SS surpluses, the above is the absolute minimum we have to do if we do not want to defautl on our debt between 2012 and 2014. \n \n \n \n \n\n [Then Steeeeev can go read the book, and you need to go get a hint before you start charging others as inaccurate... you haven't provided anything concrete tot this thread yet but dead beat liberal left-overs, c' mon be a challenge.

I guess we're all doing just fine.\n \n\n \n No, but when you factor in the deficit spending and apply the flow through multiplier to it, growth actually comes up short. \n \n Then again, the Reagan tax cuts only lasted 2 years, then he raised taxes to the highest rate this country had seen since WWII. \n \n \n \nLook, there is no masking the fact that you appear to be a tax-and-spend liberal.

Goverment cannot think of every aspect of personal wealth or spending would reflect that. It's just good to have sound ehtically clealr laws that make participation in the playing field effective and balanced.\n\n \n None of this invalidates what I said. You are a little kid sitting at the grown up table here. The government spends a billion dollars to buy a stealth bomber. That is its own line item in GDP. The guy who assembles the landing gear on that makes $100K per year. He goes out and buys a new car because he now has a job putting landing gear on the stealth bomber. The sale of that consumer good counts in GDP as well. The guy who puts the wheels on the car still has a job because of the government spending, and he goes out and buys a new flatscreen. Once again, counted (though both the car and the flatscreen are counted in durable goods orders). \n \n \n \nThis is true... that is how they do it at MIT, Yale and Harvard... but that is also why its called cooked books. Old school economists will tell you that inflated deficit spending wreaks havoc on futures markets [you should know this] it effect, oil, natural gas... metals and a host of other economic indicators. But if you are floating debt, I guess you have to know when you need to make interest payments and when you can't float anymore. That is all we have been doing since the mid-sixties anyhow. \n\n \n It is the old school economists who formulated the theory. \n \n Is it hard to hold so many conflicting ideals in your head at once? Here you recognize that we have been floating our debt since the 60's and apparently that it can not go on forever, and yet above you take great offense to the idea that we need to raise taxes. How do you propose we stop floating that debt and actually start paying it without raising taxes? Are you thinking that you will volunteer to personally blow every little chinese guy who is holding a treasury bond and they will forget about it?? \n \n \n \nOOooooo, I'm impressed, I ran my own company too? But what is more relevant is that a) I held series 7 and 63 linceses to trade stocks and annuites - this puts me right into trading, secondly... I managed a high-tech company newley listed on the NASDAQ and all of a sudden we had a host of new rules we didn't have to play by anymore... so don't even go there. \n\n \n duhhh....the point of the cash harvesting schemes. Get it up, get it running, get it listed, suck all the cash out, burn through the R&D capital, then let the bankruptcy court sort it out. That is what those of us with brains were doing during the dot com bubble. \n \n \n \nPlease don't confuse ripples from the S&L crisis with anything else going on... \n\n \n The idea that home price increases were ripples from the S&L crisis is stupid. \n \n \nI don't recall the Fed acting in that manner... I do recall them going after companies who violated the 1992 Inside Information Act - the tech bubble though unfortunate was not pervasive. Not like we had with the banks of recently. So I don't know if that explaination will stand.\n\n \n Why do you suppose they crashed interest rates to 1% then, which was a negative real rate? Was that part of their investigation???\n \n \n \nNo, you can't explain it away the ealisy... it was simpler than that and it was more complex than that, basically greed unchecked killed the dot com era but good. \n\n \n No, stupidity CREATED the dot com era, which was essentially based on a business plan that was just plain stupid and no reasonable person could POSSIBLY have believed would have worked. That is why cash harvesting was so pervasive. It was like having a license to print money. You could be 100% honest with your investors and they would still buy and your share values kept shooting up and up and up. Then when things crashed and the investigators came sniffing around you could shrug and say \"Dunno why it didnt work\", but THEY knew. It didnt work because only an absolute ##### could have ever believed that the setup was worth anything BUT a cash harvesting scam. The thing is, EVERYBODY was doing it, and all their investors knew exactly what the stupid, stupid business plan was. \n \n Finally, people woke up to the fact that the business plan sucked and that trading little pieces of paper back and forth with increasingly large numbers on them was not actually going to make anybody rich, and that there was no underlying value AT ALL. One of the publicly traded companies that I started installed nearly 3000 miles of fiber optic cable. We knew when we were installing it that it would NEVER be used. Every 100 miles of cable we laid, though, netted us a 15% increase in our stock price. \n \n \n \nSure, but you still don't have \"stimulus\" by penalizing the major contributors to the economic engine. If you want to FIX things... you cut federal spending to the bone... and cut taxes to boot to invigorate the markets locally so it effects our traditional growth sectors... this so the dangling chad for growth isn't there to absorb it and mitigate any net growth you could have had because that's all the government does - absorb, gee... this real is basic man.\n\n \n \n If we cut federal spending to the bone and cut taxes dramatically, we default on our debt. Our economy crashes and our government dissolves.\n \n It really is basic, man. We owe lots and lots and lots of money. We owe so much money that not only do we not have any hope of repaying it without massive spending cuts and increased taxes. As of right now, we would have to cut military spending COMPLETELY...including veterans benefits...just to pay the debt service costs on our debt. As we move forward, things become even WORSE because not only do our debt service costs continue to climb dramatically, the capital we have to pay those costs decreases dramatically because the SS surplus is shrinking. \n \n \nYes, like Canada... and Danmark - if you don't mind the lines, but many Europeans are coming here to have serious medical issues taken care of because of the limits on care and the simply, the time it takes. It is clear you chose to ignore the realties and perils of a nationalized health monstrosity. We don't need the government doing anything that the private markets can't address.\n \n\n \n I think that if you compare the number of foreigners coming to the US for medical care with the number of Americans sneaking across the border to canada for care, or going to india, costa rica, or any of a dozen other \"medical tourism\" locations, you will be surprised at how silly your argument is. Also, in the only study thus far of its kind, Aetna found that waiting times in the US are actually longer than in canada, france, or the Uk. The CEO of Aetna is probably uniquely qualified to comment on this since his entry into the health care field came when he started a company than does nothing but get appointments with specialists for people here in the US who NEED them but cant get in to one in a timely manner. \n \n Course, that is not the point here. The point is that nationalized health care does not transfer wealth from the middle and lower class to the wealthy. Never will...until we try to implement it here.\n \n \nThat isn't true - we tried it, TennCare was an unmitigated disaster; or did you forget that?\n\n \n No, that IS true. 45% of money put into our health system ends up as insurance company profit. That is one of the big problems with our health care system. \n \n An no, we did not try it. What tenncare did was provide insurance. That will not EVER work. Insurance increases health care costs. Always has, always will. \n \n \nAnyway you slice it... there is not room for socialism in a capitalist superstructe... the two are oil and water.\n\n \n Right...which is why the US is the only first world nation that is not primarily a mixed system. Claiming the 2 are \"oil and water\" only works if there are not literally dozens fo examples of mixed systems that seem to work at least as well as our own.",

   "Darn Republican,\n \n You are going to have to realize that Daewoo is anything but a liberal. Some ideas are just fact and can't be disagreed upon. I'm sure Daewoo and I have differing views on how to fix health care, for example, but when you know what you are talking about the worst solution will still probably work ok. \n \n Here we are talking about a few completely different things. Fixing our economy is different from growth in the economy which is different from governments role in a society which is different from fixing government. Daewoo is correct when he says we have to raise taxes and lower spending. The GAO has been stating this for a decade as the only way to fix our governments fiscal position. The result of this fix will be terrible for our economy but doing nothing is even worse. You must understand that we have ALREADY spent trillions more than we should have. It isn't a matter of not spending (other than to stop the bleeding). The bill will come due and lower taxes results in a default which sends us into 3rd world status. We'd be Mexico in 10 years. \n \n There is also no dispute on government spending causing growth as seen on GDP. I understand the point that it really isn't \"true\" growth but more borrowed growth (this is the argument I use when saying no growth exists) but growth is still growth when looking at GDP. The New Deal is a perfect example as my link shows. During the depression you literally had no growth from industry so any multiplier effect could be seen (a very rare occurrence). We saw government spending go up in GDP and as a result personal consumption went up at a rate of about 3% for every 1% increase in government spending. Private investment was a little bit less. There is no disputing that. Of course the crazy left stops there and fails to look at the 2 years after the New Deal. Government spending decreased and the numbers fell. \n \n You are failing to see that Daewoo is not arguing for a \"new deal\" economy...he is only telling you the reality of what happens.",

   "Marc, I took debate for 7 years. I know what poisoning the well is, and I know that if your opponent catches you doing it it is worth 20 points...10 for the fallacy, 10 for the ad hominem attack. \n\n \n Read your own copy/paste; \n \n \"The person making such an attack is hoping that the unfavorable information will bias listeners against the person in question and hence that they will reject any claims he might make. However, merely presenting unfavorable information about a person (even if it is true) hardly counts as evidence against the claims he/she might make. \"\n \n All you just did was put up a logical fallacy reference that went into more detail than mine did. Your reference to age was \"unfavorable information\" IT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID.\n \n \nYour reliance on this page, written by high school students, is an appeal to false authority. There is nothing at all to indicate, and it is HIGHLY unlikely that, these kids are qualified in any way to comment on these issues besides publishing their OPINIONS, which are worthless as factual debate material. \n\n \n Not necessarily, if it squares with current observable events and trends. I wasn't heavily relying on it. Declaring something worthless as factual debate material for technical reasons works well for scoring poinsts and determining winners and losers, but can get in the way if FINDING OUT WHAT THE TRUTH IS has any priority. I'm afraid that in academia today, rules for debate and point scoring and logical fallacies and judging and all of that are largely determined by those who favor liberal points of view, and need ways to help themselves. You tend to take advantage of it in some ways, and make a mess of it in others. \n \n By claiming you \"took debate for seven years\", was that an appeal to your own authority, or the authority of your instructors? Debate is almost always a blend of opinions and facts. I'd be willing to bet that sometime in those seven years, you would have been exposed to the fact that NEVER CONCEDING A POINT is not good for a debator, if he has been busted on a FACT, as you just have. To put up a similar copy/paste and dance a jig is not becoming of someone with much knowledge of debating. Classroom knowledge yes, actual knowledge, no. \n \n \nWrong. The term \"neoconservative\" actually has a definition and refers to a defined group of republicans. Originally Neocons were democrats who crossed party lines to attempt to guide our foreign policy toward using military means to right what they saw as social injustice and to usher in what they saw as a new age of American Supremacy where we use our awesome military might to impose their social vision on the world. It was similar to Republicans crossing party lines in the south in an attempt to influence democratic party direction...which is where the descriptive term \"southern democrat\" comes from....they are conservative democrats who are a remnant of republican influence on the party. \n \n Irving Kristol was the founder of the modern neoconservative movement, and when he died his son took the reigns and founded the Weekly Standard and the Project for a New American Century, which was a group that was designed to solidify and advance the neoconservative agenda. Most of Bushs cabinet memebers were also PNAC members. \n\n \n Sources? Is this liberal propaganda? I've heard the term \"neocon\" tossed around by Bob Beckel, Kirsten Powers, Juan Williams, Alan Colmes, Ellis Hennican, many other liberal regulars on Fox News debates, simply as a reference to someone who is extremely conservative - Ann Coulter for example. Was Ann Coulter ever a Democrat? \n \n \nYou do realize that CAFE has been tested in the courts and found to be constitutional, right?? \n\n \n Yes, so was separation of church and state in 1947. Liberals are much more likely than conservatives to take as gospel anything the courts decide. \n \n \nPrior to the rollout of CAFE standards, states were rolling out their own emissions and auto safety standards and there was a VERY REAL possibility that it was going to destroy the auto industry because the cost of making different models for different states was enormous. The federal government stepped in and essentially put an end to it by establishing nationwide manufacturing standards for automakers. It is WELL within their powers to do so. \n\n \n Just like it is well within their powers to recognize the degradation and destruction that things like abortion and gay marriage can do to a society. It is conservative to oppose things like that federally. The \"states rights\" thing meanders back and fourth according to liberal vs conservative principles. When you don't like states rights on CAF\u00c9 standards, and do like states rights on gay marriage, it largely identifies you as a liberal. When it's reversed, it largely identifies you as a conservative. \n \n \nIt has been argued that CAFE standard MIGHT not apply to vehicles manufactured in a particular state for use ONLY in that state. To argue that, though, you get into whether or not congress actually has the constitional power under the commerce clause to set environmental standards, which has also been tested in the courts. \n \n Frankly, things like CAFE and environmental standards are EXACTLY what congress was created for. They impact the entire nation, not just the state in question, and it is impossible to regulate them at the state level effectively. \n\n \n That's the liberal view, yes - safety and the environment impact the entire nation, and supersede personal liberty in those regards. The conservative view is that maintaining traditional standards and protecting them from sudden change, while keeping federal government small is what congress was created for. Things like abortion and gay marriage can supersede personal, civil liberty in those regards. \n \n \nYep. I got busy with a flood. Foolish me. Honestly, I probably screwed up by conceding, and several people PM'd me to say so. I should have gone back with a one liner along the lines of \"Your entire response was nothing but hyperbole, so there is no substance to respond to\". I just felt that would be disrespectful...even if it was true. \n\n \n You were already doing that in the first couple of posts, and it wasn't working for you! You weren't the only one who got PM's! (I got a congratulatory one from one of the judges - he said it was all over for you anyway)\n \n Yes, it was one of those floods that keeps you from fulfilling responsibility in one debate, while letting you make 109 posts in other forums, in a period of only two weeks!. I also noticed at the time that it was one of those floods that goes completely unreported in weather and news reports. The moderator gave you a pass - I didn't say anything at the time, too busy laughing. And I'm the first to admit that I was on the receiving end of a lot of laughs in the FOUR formal debates that I lost. The difference was, I fulfilled my obligations and was a good sport. Did you learn anything about that in your seven years?\n \n \nI was referring to debating the \"who is a liberal and who is a conservative\". We have done it before, you looked like an #####. \n\n \n Link please? How many were ganged up on me in that one - how many liberals were helping you? \n \n \nHmmm...where are national debate champions from.....\n \n They are all American. When people say \"National Debate Champions\" they are generally referring to NDT champions.\n\n \n Again, No link? Just more bluff? \n \n I'll bet your friends there are experts at how many points are taken off for logical fallacies. I'll bet they're so good, they could convince anyone that up is down, black is white, Bill Clinton is a conservative, etc. But there's one additional thing that means something to me, and that is ATTEMPTING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE TRUTH IS. Do you think that means anything to them at all? \n \n I'd gladly set something up with you there, or here, but I'm afraid it would result in another flood. I have a problem that can sometimes be more annoying than your type of floods - I have to work for a living. What would really be the use?",

Do you understand that when you commit a logical fallacy, what that says is essentially that your argument is good sounding nonsense....that your entire train of thought is flawed?? In this case it is primarily your reliance on this article that is the fallacy, not necessarily your entire belief, but then the belief has already been shown to be logically flawed.\n \n \nSources? Is this liberal propaganda? I've heard the term \"neocon\" tossed around by Bob Beckel, Kirsten Powers, Juan Williams, Alan Colmes, Ellis Hennican, many other liberal regulars on Fox News debates, simply as a reference to someone who is extremely conservative - Ann Coulter for example. Was Ann Coulter ever a Democrat? \n\n \n As well as Ron Paul, Pat Buchanan, Rush Limbaugh, Bruce Bartlett, Joe Scarborough, and several other prominent conservatives. Once again, your argument is illogical. The fact that some liberals talk about neocons does not make them imaginary propaganda. \n \n Neo-conservative - SourceWatch\n \n \nA neo-conservative (abbreviated as neo-con or neocon) is part of a U.S. based political movement rooted in liberal Cold War anticommunism and a backlash to the social liberation movements of the 1960s and 1970s. These liberals drifted toward conservatism: thus they are new (neo) conservatives. They favor an aggressive unilateral U.S. foreign policy. They generally believe that elites protect democracy from mob rule. Sometimes the spelling is \"neoconservative.\"\n\n \n \nThe early leaders of the neoconservative movement were Irving Kristol (author of 1983 book Reflections of a Neoconservative) and Norman Podhoretz, both of whom have served as editors of Commentary Magazine, the flagship publication of the American Jewish Committee, a centrist American-Jewish organization. On its webpage Commentary boasts it is known \"as the intellectual home of the neoconservative movement\" which is \"vitally engaged in the preservation and spread of democracy and Western values.\" [4]\n\n \n I included the second quote because I think you need to realize that \"neoconservative\" is not a smear, it is a label that many proudly adopt. Wolfowitz and Cheney have both been proud members of the neocon movement. \n \n \n\n Yes, so was separation of church and state in 1947. Liberals are much more likely than conservatives to take as gospel anything the courts decide. \n\n \n LOL. I disagree with most of the #### that the courts hand down....probably FAR more than you. However, when you are talking about CAFE standards you are not talking about an illogical ruling that requires mental gymnastics to understand. It is a straight line. \n \n \nJust like it is well within their powers to recognize the degradation and destruction that things like abortion and gay marriage can do to a society. It is conservative to oppose things like that federally. The \"states rights\" thing meanders back and fourth according to liberal vs conservative principles. When you don't like states rights on CAF\u00c9 standards, and do like states rights on gay marriage, it largely identifies you as a liberal. When it's reversed, it largely identifies you as a conservative. \n\n \n \nTo regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes;\n\n \n That is the part of the constitution that empowers congress to regulate interstate commerce. Now show me the part that empowers them to combat societal moral destruction. \n \n What you are trying to do here, Marc, is use the federal government to enforce social standards...a liberal idea if I have ever heard one. I think I might start a new thread on whether or not CAFE standards are constitutional. \n \n \nYes, it was one of those floods that keeps you from fulfilling responsibility in one debate, while letting you make 109 posts in other forums, in a period of only two weeks!. I also noticed at the time that it was one of those floods that goes completely unreported in weather and news reports. The moderator gave you a pass - I didn't say anything at the time, too busy laughing. And I'm the first to admit that I was on the receiving end of a lot of laughs in the FOUR formal debates that I lost. The difference was, I fulfilled my obligations and was a good sport. Did you learn anything about that in your seven years?\n\n \n There is a difference between having 10 minutes to knock out a quick reply to something and having 2 hours to sit down and chart out all the logical fallacies you had used. \n \n Would you like a do-over? We could either start form scratch (in which case I will just be doing a C&P of my posts) or we could just finish it. Not sure who to use as judges anymore. Steeeve would be acceptable to me. It is going to have to be people who understand that formal debate is about logic, not emotional pleas and assumed bias.",

   "He's a Reagan basher, and he's bashed Thomas Sowell recently on these boards! That you and several others here give him all the free passes you do is what astounds me more than anything else. He's the biggest BS'er on this board - the only one here who ever fled from his commitment to a formal debate (without completely leaving the forum) . And yet another moderator actually made him the formal debate judge! Did you notice his butchering of logical fallacies to favor himself above? As long as I'm around, you can be real sure any future formal debate contestants/moderators are going to see it. \n\n \n Marc, you are the one who did the butchering there. As I pointed out in my last post, your understanding your understanding of that fallacy is in and of itself completely illogical. If it was as you understand it to be, you could use any source for anything and it would be impossible to refute, ever. I could say \"My wife tells me that time travel is not only possible, but practiced regularly by chimpanzees\" and it would be impossible for you to refute it. \n \n When Billsco made me the permanent official judge, he did not just make a proclamation. He asked for input from the board and even people I ALWAYS disagree with agreed. That is because as much as you may dislike it, I have no emotional baggage and absolutely no bias except towards the facts and logical argument. \n \n \nHahaha - yes , bashing Reagan, Bush, and just about every high profile conservative out there is a really good way to prove it. You've reinforced your proof with almost complete lack of confrontation with far left posters here, like Simone, Chester, and countless others. All your disdain of talk radio and Fox news helps a lot too. A book could be filled with all of your put-downs of Bush, have you said anything bad at all about Obama yet? \n\n \n Bush II was not a conservative, and frankly Reagan was questionable. We can say for SURE that Reagan was not a fiscal conservative. \n \n I debate against liberal posters here pretty much whenever they say something I disagree with that I think matters enough to respond to. I dont really care about the gay rights, religious, or abortion forums, so that cuts me out of 90% of the debate here. Also, there is a difference there, Marc. When Chester, for example, posts something I disagree with, we may go back and forth for a few posts, but generally one of us proves ourselves correct and the other one backs down. He is not like you, who will be proven wrong over and over and over again and keep coming back with the same tired, pathetic, disproved argument. \n \n You are more akin to Brady, who keeps coming back to the gun control forum and arguing the same tired, already disproved points. I dont debate Brady because he/she/it is either not bright enough, or not honest enough, to bother. You, on the other hand, do seem to be bright enough that there is some hope, if you could abandon your self imposed, ideologically driven, mental retardation and start looking at facts and logic to make your decisions instead of relying on political bias. \n \n I eventually got through to missouri mule. There is hope for you.",

History is going to bear it out. Reagan wasn't respected nearly as much three months after he left office as he is now. It will be the same with W. He was sincere. Here's a good read by a conservative about it;\n \n Michael Medved : The Right Standard for Judging George W. Bush - Townhall.com\n \n \nAfter the devastating attacks of September 11, 2001, and Bush's almost instantaneous rebirth as a determined \"War President,\" most Americans expressed clear ideas of what they expected of the commander in chief. The conventional wisdom of the time declared that his presidency would rise or fall based on his ability to keep the nation safe. If the United States sustained a series of crippling new attacks the world understood that history would judge Bush as a failure. If, against all odds, he succeeded in turning the tide against our terrorist adversaries and managed to keep the nation secure from homeland assaults, then the president would emerge from his terms of office as a successful, and probably heroic, chief executive. \n\n \n How quickly everyone forgets. \n \n ____________________\n \n \nYou miss that point that poisoning the well is something you do AGAINST YOUR OPPONENT and is a proxy ad hominen attack. \n\n \n I miss it because it's only you saying it, with nothing to back it up.

Such as attacks on the authors age. \n \n \nThink about what you are claiming here, Marc. This is akin to saying \"My dentists says THIS about nuclear physics\" and then arguing that anybody who points out that your dentist is not an expert in nuclear physics and that his opinion is not especially valid is engaged in a logical fallacy \n\n \n I just thought about it, using LOGIC. It's not akin to it at all, because nuclear physics is one high-tech, narrow field that does not compare to a general knowledge of basic U.S. politics. \n \n \nDeclaring an article written by high school students that puts forth political definitions to be invalid is just plain logic in any circumstances. \n\n \n EXCEPT FOR ONE CIRCUMSTANCE, THE ONE WHEN THE DECLARER CAN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING TO COUNTERACT IT. \n \n \nHe is not like you, who will be proven wrong over and over and over again and keep coming back with the same tired, pathetic, disproved argument. \n\n \n At least I don't start new threads to try to divert attention from existing, active ones. \n ____________________\n \n \n And with that I'm going to vacate this place for who knows how long.

Such as attacks on the authors age. \n\n \n This time I will put in in bold italics so the marginally literate will be sure to catch it:\n \n Fallacy: Poisoning the Well\n \n\n This sort of \"reasoning\" is obviously fallacious. The person making such an attack is hoping that the unfavorable information will bias listeners against the person in question and hence that they will reject any claims he might make. However, merely presenting unfavorable information about a person (even if it is true) hardly counts as evidence against the claims he/she might make. This is especially clear when Poisoning the Well is looked at as a form of ad Homimem in which the attack is made prior to the person even making the claim or claims. The following example clearly shows that this sort of \"reasoning\" is quite poor.\n\n \n There, I even underlined it. \n \n \n \n \nI just thought about it, using LOGIC.

Do you really expect the high school kids who wrote this to have a better understanding? The above is also a logical fallacy. It is an appeal to the masses, which is a by proxy appeal to ignorance.

If you will recall that is how we ended up bringing up gay marriage here, which is unquestionably outside the power of congress to regulate, and you then brought up CAFE and emissions standards, which are unquestionably WITHIN the power of congress to regulate.

I will quote you directly to ensure I do not misrepresent your position. I just find it fascinating that some alleged conservatives, with constitutionalism being a LONG HELD core value of the conservative movement in this country, seem to have no idea what the document actually contains. \n \n \n \nAnd with that I'm going to vacate this place for who knows how long. I'm going to get more heavily into some outdoor activities while I still have the liberty to do it. Thanks to ALL my communicants here. I'll lurk sometimes, and will probably be back posting eventually. \n\n \n Before you do that, why dont you pop in and explain your views on the constitutionality of laws related to potential social degradation and the constitutionality of laws related to environmental and fuel efficiency standards.\n \n Just because you got your butt handed to you in this thread is no reason to stomp off and pout.",
