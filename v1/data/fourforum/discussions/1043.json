   "Sept. 25, 2003, 4:23PM\n \n Price of cookie based on race at SMU bake sale\n Associated Press\n \n DALLAS - Southern Methodist University officials shut down a bake sale in which cookies were offered for sale at different prices, depending on the race and gender of the buyer. \n \n Tuesday's sale was organized by the Young Conservatives of Texas, who said it was intended as a protest of affirmative action. \n \n A sign said white males had to pay $1 for a cookie. The price was 75 cents for white women, 50 cents for Hispanics and 25 cents for blacks. \n \n Members of the conservative group said they meant no offense and were only trying to exercise their freedom of speech to protest the use of race or gender as a factor in college admissions. \n \n Similar sales have been held at U.S. colleges since February. \n \n A black student filed a complaint with SMU, saying the sale was offensive. SMU officials said they halted the event after 45 minutes because it created a potentially unsafe situation for students. \n \n \"This was not an issue about free speech,\" Tim Moore, director of the Hughes-Trigg Student Center, said in a story for today's edition of The Dallas Morning News. \"It was really an issue where we had a hostile environment being created that was potentially volatile.\" \n \n The sale drew a crowd of students outside the student center and several engaged in a shouting match, Moore said. \n \n David C. Rushing, 23, a second-year law student and chairman of Young Conservatives of Texas at SMU and for the state, said the event didn't get out of hand. At most, a dozen students gathered around the table of cookies and Rice Krispie treats, he said. \n \n \"We copied what's been done at multiple campuses around the country to illustrate our opinion of affirmative action and how we think it's unfair,\" he said. \n \n Chapters of the group held similar bake sales at the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University earlier this month. In both cases, the schools allowed the events, citing university free speech policies. \n \n Matt Houston, a 19-year-old sophomore, called the group's price list offensive. \n \n \"My reaction was disgust because of the ignorance of some SMU students,\" said Houston, who is black. \"They were arguing that affirmative action was solely based on race. It's not based on race. It's based on bringing a diverse community to a certain organization.\" \n \n The group sold three cookies during its protest, raising $1.50. \n \n Minority enrollment among SMU's 10,000-member student body is 19 percent. \n \n In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled universities could use race as a factor in admissions under limited conditions. The ruling changes the landscape in Texas, where universities have been banned from using race as a factor since a 1996 decision by a lower court. \n \n The bake sales date back to early February when one was held by the Bruin Republicans group at the University of California, Los Angeles. \n \n College Republican chapters at the University of California-Berkeley, the University of New Mexico, the University of Richmond in Virginia, the University of Michigan, Northwestern University and Illinois State University followed suit.",

When the staff were all white (racism being only one example of a reason to qualify for employment equity), the volunteer base was also white dominated, and so mostly only white students used the resource- despite the fact that the University demographics showed we should have been getting a much more diverse population. After instituting employment equity, two new staff members (both people of color, both low-income prior to the new job,one of whom was also disabled), the volunteer bas began to become more diverse, and so were the people who used our resources. In fact, usage increased do much we had to eventually get a larger budget and hire another staff member.\n \n \nWhy shouldn't it be?

   "You don't seem to catch the hypocrisy in only being angry with \"white people\" benefiting from a lack of policy...\n\n \n I'm not. Again, you misunderstand affirmative action. It is not only dependant on \"race\". Some white people will benefit from affirmative action, such as those with disabilities, etc.\n \n \nYou mentioned the word policy. This is a law. I am especially against most FEDERAL LAWS. You want the government to protect people by passing laws. I do not believe it is their job.\n\n \n A policy is not a law. Thankfully, most libertarians are able to differenciate between state bureaucracy and autonomous organization. I have no interest in government laws, but I do believe if they are going to have any they should be protective to the people and not the government and those on power.\n \n You are misusing the term \"libertarian\" if you believe it means that you must be against boundaries or regulations of all kinds. Perhaps yu should call yourself a nihilist instead.\n \n \nFor instance, in this case: it will have the effect of blacks being less likely hired due to fear of civil rights lawsuits. We are fearful every time we need to let someone go that is minority other than ours. Now we are less likely to hire out of this fear.\n\n \n 1. All people of colour are not of African descent, so I don't know why you speak as if Black people are the only people effected by affirmative action on an anti-racist basis.\n \n 2. Affirmative action is not only about race. I have said this before.\n \n 3. Who are you referring to when you say \"we\", as in \"now we are less likely to hire out of this fear\"? Are you a human resources manager? Are you speaking of white people doing hirings in general? \n \n 4. Your point makes no sense. \n a) those who wouldn't hire a Black person for fear of getting sued for firing them are making hiring decisions based on racism, which proves my point that affirmative action is necessary\n b) those who wouldn't hire a Black person for fear of getting sued for firing them could just as easily be sued for racist hiring practices according to that logic, and with good reason, see a).\n c) we were discussing affirmative action, now you're talking about being sued for firing someone for racist reasons, which is not the same thing at all.\n \n \nI do doubt that as many people will be angry about the minorities benefiting than they would be for the white people benefiting and therefore the hypocricy of the whole thing is lost as long as the minorities benefit.\n\n \n Don't worry. I doubt the \"oppressed white man\" contigent is going to dissapear any time soon. \n \n Anyway, the point is that white people are not being forced into poverty en masse because of affirmative action, which is exactly what is happening to people of color because of racism. So I think your argument that the two are the same is absurd.",

Does this mean you want to continue the debate or not, because you said- \"I will agree to disagree with you and thanks for responding to my posts, it is appreciated\".\n \n \nI have a set of principles that only favor laws against force or fraud, especially on the federal level.

After all, the thread was about affirmative action, and you keep responding as though I were talking about Civil Rights Laws.\n \n I against drug laws, gun laws, immigration laws, property laws, and things like that. My set of principles comes from a tradition of libertarianism that goes back thousands of years. Again, I'm not going to waste my time fighting against state laws that \"force\" people to hire equitably any more than I will fight laws against child molesting. Not because I think child molesting and racist hiring are the same thing. Not because I think that it should be the government intervening in these situations, nor because I think they are effective at it, and certainly not because I believe in their authority.\n \n It is interesting that you consider the libertarianism of your political party as defining libertarianism, and speak of libertarian socialists as though they were a freak minority of libertarians. In fact, free-market anarchism, libertarian capitalism, or whatever else you might call yourself, are all terms to define a recently developed subsection of libertarian philosphy. The term \"libertarian\" originates with social anarchists.\n \n \nAnarchists have been using the term \"libertarian\" to describe themselves and their ideas since the 1850's. The revolutionary anarchist Joseph Dejacque published Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement social in New York between 1858 and 1861 [Max Nettlau, A Short History of Anarchism, p. 75]. According to anarchist historian Max Nettlau, the use of the term \"libertarian communism\" dates from November, 1880 when a French anarchist congress adopted it [Ibid., p. 145]. The use of the term \"Libertarian\" by anarchists became more popular from the 1890s onward after it was used in France in an attempt to get round anti-anarchist laws and to avoid the negative associations of the word \"anarchy\" in the popular mind (Sebastien Faure and Louise Michel published the paper Le Libertaire -- The Libertarian -- in France in 1895, for example). Since then, particularly outside America, it has always been associated with anarchist ideas and movements. Taking a more recent example, in the USA, anarchists organised \"The Libertarian League\" in July 1954, which had staunch anarcho-syndicalist principles and lasted until 1965. The US-based \"Libertarian\" Party, on the other hand has only existed since the early 1970's, well over 100 years after anarchists first used the term to describe their political ideas (and 90 years after the expression \"libertarian communism\" was first adopted).\n\n \n Tell me, is the party you are in the one that is associated with Ayn Rand? Would you like to debate forms of libertarianism in the Political section?",

   "Thank you. My avatar is a spiderweb. Does this mean you want to continue the debate or not, because you said- \"I will agree to disagree with you and thanks for responding to my posts, it is appreciated\". \n\n \n I agree to disagree.\n \n \n Well, you seem to be mixing them up. After all, the thread was about affirmative action, and you keep responding as though I were talking about Civil Rights Laws. \n\n \n I give up. I didn't mix them up. I bring up civil rights laws because they affect actions.\n \n \n I against drug laws, gun laws, immigration laws, property laws, and things like that. My set of principles comes from a tradition of libertarianism that goes back thousands of years. Again, I'm not going to waste my time fighting against state laws that \"force\" people to hire equitably any more than I will fight laws against child molesting. Not because I think child molesting and racist hiring are the same thing. Not because I think that it should be the government intervening in these situations, nor because I think they are effective at it, and certainly not because I believe in their authority. \n \n \n I don't speak out against all laws either. Some are more egregious that others. I agree. Even stoplights are social engineering and I don't waste time fighting those.\n \n \n It is interesting that you consider the libertarianism of your political party as defining libertarianism, and speak of libertarian socialists as though they were a freak minority of libertarians. In fact, free-market anarchism, libertarian capitalism, or whatever else you might call yourself, are all terms to define a recently developed subsection of libertarian philosphy. The term \"libertarian\" originates with social anarchists. \n\n \n I am pretty close to an anarchist. I have learned something here. I have heard others call themselves libertarians but want many laws forcing companies to behave in certain ways. I am against that because this will make it harder for small companies to compete. \n \n Then I have spoken to Anarchists who want laws forcing corporations to behave in certain ways. That didn't make sense to me. In anarchy there are no laws. But definitions change. Now I consider Anarchists plain old socialists.\n \n The Libertarian Party is relatively new. I think it began by David Nolan back in the seventies when Nixon imposed price and wage controls. It started with disgruntled Republicans. \n \n Two things made me understand I was Libertarian politically. First a friend told me welfare broke up the family. I thought he was crazy. You see, I was a liberal. Then I realized it happened very close to me. \n \n The second was drugs. My dad told me he thought drugs should be legalized. It took me a year or so watching the news. The problems were not necessarily drug problems but drug prohibition problems. \n \n Then it dawned on me: Laws no matter how well intentioned will have negative effects. Laws will hurt poor people more than rich people. I was poor running my own business and realized I was competing against companies that receive subsides (I consider Laws = legislation). \n \n Even murder laws \"hurt\" poor people more than the rich. The rich are more likely to get off. BUT, this is why I settle on the force and fraud principle (We need laws against murder). Very rarely do I deviate.\n \n \n Tell me, is the party you are in the one that is associated with Ayn Rand? Would you like to debate forms of libertarianism in the Political section?\n\n \n I love Ayn Rand's books but I don't think her institute follows her principles entirely. I have heard she did not care for Libertarians. That is strange because I agree with her philosophy. Maybe libertarians were different before Nolan started the party. \n \n Debate? Sure. You know that I will favor very few laws, right?\n \n Thanks again for the dialog. I am sorry for questioning your libertarianism.",

   "Well, \"theLibertarian\" said \"I think it is a good analogy. Depending on your race you are given preference.\"\n \n What he's describing is racism, which is the present situation that \"affirmative action\" or \"equal opportunity\" is intended to correct. That is why so few people of color are in positions of power in the US and other white-dominated societies.\n \n If people are scared of people of color getting an equal opportunity, they should evaluate what it is about them that makes them so insecure. Maybe they just aren't good enough at what they do to compete with people of color when racist hiring policies aren't in practice. Whatever the psychological reason, equating equality of opportunity with racism demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of what racism is. Not to mention a serious inferiority complex.\n\n what if they where black kids selling the cookies for the same prices?would that be racism?",

   "Here's a good one:\n \n \nA Working Definition of Racism: Revised 7/88\n - By Ricky Sherover-Marcuse \n \n Human beings are members of the same species. The term 'racism' is useful as a shorthand way of categorizing the systematic mistreatment experienced by people of color and Third world people both in the United States and in many other parts of the world. But this term should not mislead us into supposing that human beings belong to biologically different species. We all belong to one race, the human race. \n \n \n The systematic mistreatment experienced by people of color is a result of institutionalized inequalities in the social structure. Racism is one consequence of a self-perpetuating imbalance in economic, political and social power. This imbalance consistently favors members of some ethnic and cultural groups at the expense of others. The consequences of this imbalance pervade all aspects of the social system and affect all facets of people's lives. \n \n \n At its most extreme, systematic mistreatment takes the form of physical violence and extermination, but it occurs in many other forms as well. Pervasive invalidation, the denial or the non-recognition of the full humanity of persons of color also constitutes the mistreatment categorized as racism. \n \n Putting the matter in these terms may clear up the confusion, which is generated by thinking of racism merely as 'different treatment'. If we examine the facts, we will see that what is often called 'different treatment' is in reality inhuman treatment, i.e. treatment which denies the humanity of the individual person and their group.\n \n \n The systematic mistreatment of any group of people generates misinformation about them, which in turn becomes the 'explanation' of or justification for continued mistreatment. Racism exists as a whole series of attitudes, assumptions, feelings and beliefs about people of color and their cultures which are a mixture of misinformation, fear and ignorance. \n \n Just as 'the systematic mistreatment of people of color' means 'inhuman treatment', so 'misinformation about people of color' designates beliefs and assumptions that in any way imply that people of color are less than fully human. These beliefs and attitudes are not just neutral errors; they are impacted misinformation: ideas and opinions which are glued together with painful emotion and held in place by frozen memories of distressing experiences. \n \n \n Because misinformation about people of color functions as the justification for their continued mistreatment, it becomes socially empowered or sanctioned misinformation. It is recycled through the society as a form of conditioning that affects everyone. In this way, misinformation about people of color becomes part of everyone's 'ordinary' assumptions. \n \n \n For purposes of clarity, it is helpful to use the term 'internalized racism' or 'internalized oppression' to designate the misinformation that people of color may have about themselves and their cultures. The purpose of this term is to point out that this misinformation is consequence of the mistreatment experienced by people of color. It is not an inherent feature of their culture. \n \n \n The term 'reverse racism' is sometimes used to characterize 'affirmative action' programs, but this is inaccurate. Affirmative action programs are attempts to repair the results of institutionalized racism by setting guidelines and establishing procedures for finding qualified applicants from all segments of the population. \n \n \n The term 'reverse racism' is also sometimes used to characterize the mistreatment that individual whites may have experienced at the hands of individuals of color. This too is inaccurate. While any form of humans harming other humans is wrong because no one is entitled to mistreat anyone, we should not confuse the occasional mistreatment experienced by whites at the hands of people of color with the systematic and institutionalized mistreatment experienced by people of color at the hands of whites. \n \n \n Racism operates as a strategy of divide and conquer. It helps to perpetuate a social system in which some people are consistently 'haves' and others are consistently 'have nots'. While the 'haves' receive certain material benefits from this situation, the long range effects of racism short change everyone. Racism sets groups of people against each other and makes it difficult for us to perceive our common interests as human beings. \n \n Racism make us forget that we all need and are entitled to good health care, stimulating education, and challenging work. Racism limits our horizons to what presently exists. Racism makes us suppose that current injustices are 'natural', or at best, inevitable: \"someone has to be unemployed; someone has to go hungry.\" Most importantly, racism distorts our perceptions of the possibilities for change; it makes us abandon our visions of solidarity; it robs us of our dreams of community. \n\n \n If your definition of racism does not include the fact that within the structure of racism \"white\" is considered the ideal, the superior, the first, etc., than your definition of racism is incomplete. It does not make sense according to to history of racism in this world.",

Just because something WAS doesn't mean it still IS. Not that I don't acknowledge that racism still exists, because it definitely does. However, that by no means suggests that it can't occur both ways. If something is wrong for one group, it has to be wrong for EVERY group. That is caled equality.",
