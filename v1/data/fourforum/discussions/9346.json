   "View the story here:\n http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/dec/12/kline_chosen_johnson_county_district_attorney/\n \n Another link is here but I think it will tell you you need a subscription. If it does, just go to their homepage and do a search for Phil Kline and you will get to the story without havinf to do the subscription:\n http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/16218307.htm\n \n \n Here is the gist of the story: Phil Kline, who despite having served four years as an attorney general had absolutely no experience prosecuting criminal cases, but still had support of anti-choicers. He ran against Democrat Paul Morrison in November for the position of Attorney General. Kline lost with 41 percent to Morrison's 59 percent. \n \n \n Now, members of the Republican precinct commitee (not a public voting group but that of the Republican party) where Paul Morrison left his county district attorney position to become the new attorney general, voted for the appointment for the new position. They voted in Phil Kline. This is the same man that the voters voted overwhelmingly aginst in the election. In fact, in Johnson county where he will take this new position, he lost 35 percent to Morrison's 65 percent in that district. This is a prime example of how the Republicans care only for themselves, and not for the voice of the people.\n \n By the way, his nomination was mainly supported by an anti-choice group called Kansans-for-Life.\n \n \n This is just one of the examples for the reason I will never vote for a Republican candidate again. (I used to vote Republican until George W.)\n Other examples are of course their blatant anti-abortion and anti-gay actions.",

As a result, his previous position of district attorney of Johnson county was open. The republican group chose to defy the wishes of the people by allowing Kline to get the vacated position, despite the fact that Johnson County voters had voted overwhelmingly against him in the Attorney General election. If you had actually read it, maybe you wouldn't need to ask the obvious.\n \n I can use the term \"anti-choice\", whenever I please. I don't care at all if you call me \"pro-death\", because I know it is a lie. Your ilk however, can accurately be called anti-choice, as your movement tries to deny women the choice of having an abortion, and in some cases, even tries to deny us contraceptive methods.",
