   "According to the American Kennel Assoc, Dogs have a 100% chance of ...\n ...children are small humans.\n ...\n\n Peddler -- This is not evidence for creation. Regardless of how life started and came to be what it is today, dogs will have dogs... cats will have cats, etc. Your task is to produce evidence for creation.\n \n \nLiving organisms with irreducible complexity.\n\n I'm sorry... what? This is a sentence fragment. It is not a complete thought. Try again so that we can perhaps understand that which you are attempting to communicate.\n \n \nAstronomy displays exactly what one would expect in a created universe. Planets that are in such perfect order they can be used to navigate , record the seasons etc. Binary systems with counter rotating bodies that could not happen in a big bang senario.\n\n Again, you are not providing any evidence for creation.\n \n \nAll over the world we find sea creatures high up in the mountains . We find billions of fossils entomed in rock during a watery catastrophy.\n\n Check your facts, my friend... I question whether 'billions' of fossils have been found period, regardless of how they became fossils. But perhaps you have a reference for your claim that billions of fossils have been found. Beyond that, where's your reference for this watery catastrophe that entombed all these fossils? We need facts, man! You are attempting to provide evidence for creation, remember?\n \n \nThe symbiotic relationships of animals and plants that can only survive together.\n\n And this is evidence of creation... how? Please provide an explanation and a reference for how this is evidence of creation. Thank you! :-)",

   "All over the world we find sea creatures high up in the mountains . We find billions of fossils entomed in rock during a watery catastrophy.\nAnother example of you inability to think. Creationists tell us that the strata of the geological record was created when the great flood washed things down from the high ground into the depths. Animals that could run fastest were able to run to the high ground and save themselves longer. Thus, humans and mammals are at the top of the geologic column.\n \n Except that doesn't explain why every sloth fossil is above every dinosaur fossil in the record. And if the story is true, then I guess the flowering plants could run faster than the Cycads. And of course, all of those sea creatures that are found on top of mountains could run faster than any of the others. But there is another problem with that. The fossils of the sea creatures aren't on the mountains - they are in the mountains. And very few of those creatures are found living today in the same form.",

   "To quote something I wrote earlier in another forum....(pretty pompous..I know.)\n \n Evolution does not= aetheism.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \"Really? I validate the bible and any world religion against science, I demand the bible be validatable and authenticateable from science or I could not believe in it. Granted there are spiritual parts we cannot validate, but we validate earthly things God said and trust Him in spiritual things we cant validate.\"\n end quote.\n begin my quote.\n I try to do the same but at the same time the creation story in the bible requires supernatural intervention to even be possible. I don't believe that the earth was created in a small number of literal days nor do I believe that the timeline of the bible for mans creation is correct when interpretted literally. This is why I believe that evolution is currently more Scientifically valid as the empirical evidence supporting it is greater than that supporting the bible's creation story.\n I can however interpret it as metaphor in that a day to the creator may seem to be any unimaginably long period of time to us. The other alternative is that god did litteraly create us exactly as stated in the bible and because he is of infinite power is capable of anything. (including things that seem paradoxical to us) This however must remain a spiritual belief because it cannot be validated by science. This is why I believe that biblical creation and the story of adam and eve should not be taught in science class. I do however offer that classes on religions should be offered as electives to students, objectively educating students about religious practices and beliefs as well as personal ethics. (Actually teaching religious doctrine should be kept with the experts at church/temple and whatever version of sunday school there is.) \n The thing I have to disagree with you on (you do make really good points) is that I don't believe evolution necessarily means aetheism or moral reletavism, and that it doesn't have to conflict with religious beliefs.",
