Evolution claims nothing that is outside the realm of the knowable. It's by that definition, rational. The entire theory, as is all knowledge, is subject to evidence, not being self-contradictory (as your statements often are), and not contradicting some other validated knowledge.

However, they have no evidence, so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue. Even a simple application of Occam's razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely, of life, and they have evidence to support it. It's why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply isn't going anywhere.

If you are to separate truth from what is false, then you must know what is truthful.\n\n \n I most certainly can tell the difference, in degrees in most cases, in certainty with others.

Christians don't just take a blind leap in the dark; you've generalised. There might be some, however this ignores the wealth of thought by Christians into the theology of Christianity. It is reasoned faith that many Christians have, and which you ignore. There's 2,000 years of great Christian thinkers (some are referred to by Catholics as \"Doctors of the Church\").

I am not attacking the achievements of science. I am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering.\n \nYes, I am saying that reasoned arguments from anthropology can and do account for the evolution of morals, the law, etc. in human societies.\n\n Do you believe, like Dawkins in a 'religious gene'?\n \nThe growth in complexity of physical organisms is analogous to the growth of social complexity in human societies: the study of the former can throw\n light on the development of the latter.\n\n Much of history is cyclical.

But there is more to it. Even if they have no conscious social agenda, scientists are bound by the same preconceptions as everyone else - their social, religious, and educational backgrounds influence their choices of theories and, perhaps more important, their philosophies of science. Karl Popper noted more than once that it doesn't matter where hypotheses come from, only whether they explain the evidence they are based on, wether they are subject to disproof, and whether they can hold up to enthusiastic attempts to disprove them. This philosophy forms the basis of deductive science. But hypothesis do come from somewhere, often the underlying assumptions of society. Moreover, not only the differences in sources of ideas, but also different premises scientists have held about evolution, human nature, God, and how science should be done, have always underscored the controversies about human evolution.\"\n \n Wolpoff, M & Caspari, R, (1997) \"Race and Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction\", p12.\n I have been at pains to quote this, not because their work is in the field of epistemology (for when I post evidence, from epistemological sources, I get the reaction I just got from you; 'too much information'/'irrelevant to scientists!' These evolutionists recognise the variety of influences, not all affecting us all on a conscious level. You simply ignore this evidence and present a statement that you don't believe it.\n \n Further I find it odd people should demand that I cease quoting from outside sources to back up my statements.",

Evolution claims nothing that is outside the realm of the knowable\n\n You mean, \"Materialistic evolution claims nothing that is outside the realm of the material\".\n \n It's by that definition, rational. The entire theory, as is all knowledge, is subject to evidence, not being self-contradictory (as your statements often are), and not contradicting some other validated knowledge. Evolution meets these requirements, and is therefore entirely rational. Anything else?\n\n Yes, prove it by science. I don't want you to keep reverting to word games/sophistry; philosophical arguments. You must prove it by science. Show me the scientific experiment that proves it. I've asked you a number of times, and every time you've failed to do so.\n \n What about other 'rational' alternatives to your version of evolution; such as that postulated by ID theorists? \n\n \nIntelligent design comes in many flavors too.\n\n Indeed it does.\n \nID that submits as a designer something that has any quality of the unknowable is irrational.\n\n You make a major mistake. You don't need to know who did it. Just that someone did.\n Take another form of science; forensic medicine. They can examine a dead body and say \"This man died of un-natural causes\". Knowing this, they don't need to postulate that a particular person did it, just that an intelligence was behind it. You assume too much for ID theorists who for the most part want to show that finding a design infers a designer.\n \nID that submits we were created/designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims. However, they have no evidence, so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue.\n\n But you think SETI is worthwhile! :)\n \n Even a simple application of Occam's razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unnecessary when another theory can fulfil the description entirely, of life, and they have evidence to support it.\n\n So if ID theory did this, you'd accept it? Or are you against hunting for the truth?\n \nIt's why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply isn't going anywhere. You can make up a theory right now about how life began,\n\n You mean like the do with abiogenesis theories?\n \nbut if it cannot be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described...why would we?\n\n Which abiogenesis theory do you ascribe too? :)\n \n Then you just contradicted yourself. If you are to separate truth from what is false, then you must know what is truthful.\n\n \nI most certainly can tell the difference, in degrees in most cases, in certainty with others. I am human and therefore fallible, if that's what you're getting at. \n\n Not at all. You said\n \n1. Reason does not imply truth, it's a method of separating truth from what is false,\n\n In which you contradict your first clause with the second. You say reason isn't about finding truth; but separating if from what is false; which is to find what is truth!\n \nBut I'm not always fallible. That's why science exists, to filter out the fallible conclusions we humans come up with.\n\n I am not anti-science and I applaud the reduction of fallibility. However for the most part I find people like yourself of the belief that this has already happened. Not only is it a continuous journey, but that there's a myriad of influences most people don't even accept, and so these affect people.\n \nAre you familiar with the three basic laws of logic from philosophy \"101\"?\n 1. Law of identify. Anything is itself. If a proposition is true, than it is true.\n 2. The law of the excluded middle: anything is either A, or not A. A proposition can either be true, or false.\n 3. Law of contradiction (your favorite!!) - nothing can be both A, and not A. A proposition cannot be both true, and false.\n -Mach\n\n Something need not be A nor B, but C, which is a different property altogether, such as 'reasoned faith'\n I'm still waiting for your turn on providing evidence on that one ... hell will freeze over.",

Such a great saint as Augustine swears that he saw: a blind child restored to sight by the relics of Saint Gervaise and Saint Protasius at Milan; a woman in Carthage cured of a cancer by the sign of the cross made by a woman who had just been baptised; his close friend Hesperius driving off devils (who were infesting his house) by using a little soil taken from the sepulchre of our Lord, and that same soil, borne into the Church, suddenly curing a paralytic; a woman who, having touched the reliquary of Saint Stephen with a posy of flowers during a procession, rubbed her eyes with them afterwards and recovered her sight which she had recently lost...

Now David Berlinski has done the same to the editors of Commentary, who fell just as hard for his parody of \"scientific\" creationism. They must really be oppressed by evolutionary theory to publish such inspired silliness without running it by a biologist or two for soundness. Two such similar pranks in a single month make one wonder if this is just the tip of the Zeitgeist. What next?

The great evolutionist John Maynard Smith was, of course, easily able to destroy the creationist's case, and in his good-natured way he soon had the audience roaring with appreciative laughter at its expense. The creationist has his own peculiar way of dealing with this. He sprang to his feet, palms facing the audience in a gesture eloquent or magnanimous reproof. \"No, no!\" he cried reproachfully, \"Don't laugh. Let Maynard Smith have his say. It's only fair!\" This desperate (sic) pretence that the audience was laughing at Maynard Smith, when in fact it was laughing with Maynard Smith at the creationist himself, reminds me of Mr Berlinski's pretending to misunderstand Jacques Monod and me to the extent of thinking we disagree with each other over the issue of chance.\n As for the identity of the creationist who tried to pull this little stunt on Maynard Smith, it was none other than David Berlinski. The audience, by the way, saw through his tactic instantly and treated it with hoots of derision\"\n -Richard Dawkins\n Ibid, p288.\n Neither party really attempts to refute Berlinski, but they are keen to make reference to him being a creationist - a misrepresentation, because he's not. Dawkins goes further to recount an instance of somewhere else (sound familiar?) to where he believes Berlinski was wrong. This is what happens when zealots are even dared questioned.",

He makes a claim. You disagree so you label it irrational.\n\n That is true. I have a car mechanic. He's good at fixing cars. When he starts telling me about reform of the constitution based on what he hears on talk-back radio, then I treat his comments with the respect they deserve.\n \nHowever, if claims are true based on reputation, as you present, then we can must believe everyone who has a good reputation (relative to anyone). So your defense is useless.\n\n Not at all. I make no claim across the board as to reputation of everyone... I only dealt with the witnesses of Christ. Somehow you have taken a statement that I rely on the reputation of these witnesses to be a statement that I accept as reputable every single statement by everybody, based on your own swift reading of the posts in an effort to reply ASAP\n [quote=Montalban]\n And by the way, was it you who stated that he had made no such statements before, anyway?\n On the \"Moon Dust Theory\" thread you did just that.\n When I reported on his irrational statement regarding religion, this is what you said (emphasis mine)\n post #35 \n \nHere an example of being dishonest. #1 this has nothing to do with this thread. #2 you have already been corrected, but you need to be reminded, or rather, I will remind you:\n\n You said I had taken his words out of context. It goes to your own idol-worship of Dawkins, that you first attacked me for quoting his irrational words, and now you re-introduce them as if he's a reliable character. You were the one who re-introduced Dawkins into discussion, in this thread! Now you claim I'm dishonest for discussing that! What a hoot!\n \nYou are misunderstanding something, let's get back on track.\n Here is my quote below. Nowhere do I (nor should I) say that I didn't think you quoted Dawkins. In fact, if you read it again, you'll see I'm saying exactly the opposite. There is \"no need to quote Dawkins\", because you can assume I'll agree that what you post is correct, if you just site source and continue in your own words. Saying \"I'm not here to debate Dawkins\", is saying, \"why are you quoting dawkins out of the blue, is it relevant?\" Furthermore, I said basically you can assume I agree with Dawkins unless I tell you otherwise, for the sake of expeditious debate.\n\n Read what you said, you stated that I could 'paraphrase' him. I didn't. I quoted him! The implication is quite clear, you are suggesting that instead of quoting him, I've taken his words and re-arranged them into my \"...own specific statement tailored for this debate.\" Try as you might, you were wrong. I didn't tailor his words (paraphrase) them to suit my debate. I quoted him. It was quite dishonest to make a claim that I had done that. And in context of the debate as a whole it came at a time when another poster claimed more succinctly that he'd never said those words at all. So we had me quoting Dawkins. One person saying he'd never said it, and you chiming in that I'd reconstructed his words to fit a specific argument. You didn't just say I'd paraphrased him, you added... tailored for a specific debate! Your words of accusation, which were false.\n \nAs I said, I've read plenty on the subjects. I have read at least one book by Dawkins (blind watchmaker). I agree with much of his thinking. However, I'm not here debating dawkins, he is not the one here saying things which I find irrational.\n\n So you agree with his statement on religion?\n \nYou can paraphrase their quotes, into your own specific statement tailored for this debate. \n\n Here again a dishonest claim has been repeated. Thus I gave his quote in full context. You continually make such foul claims.\n \nI'm asking you to take the sum of those things you find debatable, and present them IN YOUR OWN WORDS, rather than a string of pages and pages of quotes from people that are not on the forums.\n\n I often do give my own words. Such as what you're reading now. However, unlike you I prefer reasoned debate that includes sources. I know Americans love the sound of their own voices (which itself is an opinion), but I had no idea just how much. The authority of your own voice is just your opinion.\n \nI want to debate YOUR statements, specific statements. It's fine if your statements are in opposition to a single sentence or two of a cited source. But that's never the case, it's reams of raw data that I see posted. I don't see the need to read through pages and pages to extract a single point when you could save us all some time by cutting down the volume of text. \n\n Raw data is what you argue is the reason evolution is 'true'.\n \n Which I should post here again, since you obviously still respond to 303030 other things rather than the questions at hand, which I personally think is distracting, and misleading.\n\n And you can make directly misleading remarks, such as your statement about Dawkins whom you've introduced into this thread, then you accuse me of doing so, and that it's irrelevant. Then you repeat that you believe I've reworked his statements! That's 2 for the price of 1.\n \n And from post #49 to show how Dawkins refutes a statement irrationally...\n To keep with the religious-like zeal, the irony of Dawkins attack on religion is that he displays the same irrational hatred that he accuses fundamentalists of. \n\n \nPlease prove that Dawkins is violating basic logic in his entire claim, and/or that he has zero evidence to back up his opinion.\n\n You just said you're not here to defend Dawkins! Already you've done a flip on this stance.\n \nPossibly then you could prove he was making an irrational claim, but you cannot, so cease making claims you cannot back up. Your illogical, irrational claims are simply a waste of time.\n -Mach\n\n Possibly you could state how 9/11 was an inevitable outcome of religion.",

Note your own cite does not support your support for Dawkins' comments on religion\n \"This fallacy is committed when the person in question is not a legitimate authority on the subject. \"\n Ibid.\n You thus commit the same thing you have only accused me of. That is why you can't see the difference between\n a) me making an argument about evolution, using evolution sites, such as talkorigins\n and\n b) you making an argument about religion, and citing an expert on biology, such as Dawkins.

Irony again is missed.\n \n You see Montalban, I don't have to appeal to authority, constantly, like the vast majority of your posts. If I claim 2+2=4, it's NOT my opinion.\n\n That's the problem, Mach. 2+2=4 is a truth I have no dispute with. Again you seem to have a problem with things which we don't dispute. When you state other things, you make the mistake (see reference to arrogant Americans above) that whatever you say is equally true. They are not. I ask you to put these to the test, and you can't/won't. Occasionally you sally forth with an attempt at constructing an evidenced argument, such as above, and it blows up in your face because you've only half read the site (see also your quotes on the Law of the Disputed Middle)\n Thus the Bootfitter was wrong about scientific method... even talkorigins, his own site didn't agree with him\n You were wrong on a number of things including the 'paraphrasing' of Dawkins. et al.\n \nIf you gather 13939 links to \"authorities\" that disagree, they are all wrong, it does nothing for your weak argument. Argue on your own merits, if you dare, or even can.\n\n That is illogical, when the people I cite are those that support evolution.

Just more irrational nonsense.\n -Mach\n\n It is insulting. It's based on a logical fallacy couched in arrogance. Thus you make argument that are contradictory. And you do it so often, it's simply amazing.\n * You state with absoluteness about there being no truth based on faith, because it is devoid of evidence and full of assumption, but this is a statement of faith that you give, because you've yet to show that your statement is true; by the prime judge for you for truth; science. Unless you're willing to show me the science that shows that your version of science is science. Note, I stated it was a philosophy of science; the materialist one.\n * You've stated with absolute certainty that you are entirely knowable, based on an assumption that you just are! You've suggested that you are totally material in nature, because when you did attempt to show how you could be known - it was boiled down to a theory that if someone could catalogue all your atoms, they'd know you - even your personality. But then you started to talk about nature and nurture and this lead nowhere... that argument just stopped. Your atomist-educationalist argument has also gone nowhere. Further to this, your belief that science might one day be in a position to do something is based on faith.\n * Or, like aliens might exist, but trolls certainly don't based on your knowledge that this is already so, even without evidence for or against either statement. BUT you also say that the search for aliens isn't science, but science fiction! So you support scientists conducting something you call 'science fiction' based on the fact they have no evidence for aliens existing, nor of trolls, but one form of fiction is valid, and the other is not?!?\n * You've made statements regarding the subjectivity of faith, and how it pales in comparison to science; that science should, because of its objective nature, take precedence, also because its based on evidence, yet you despise Nazi science, based on an emotive argument, not on science!\n * You've stated love is real, but have not shown any scientific proof for it. Instead, you've given a number of philosophical arguments for it. Now you're back to claiming its real, insofar as such things are just atoms firing. But still, you can't show the science test for love. Thus you claim it's a material thing that science hasn't shown is material.\n *You argue against statements couched in authority then give a post about how you're an authority on psychology, which you've called hocus pocus, anyway.\n * When I show evidence for a reasoned faith, you misapply the law of the excluded middle, and ignore those areas of science that have fuzzy logic etc.\n * You cite a support for evolution based on evidences, and yet when I argue based on evidences you state no amount of evidences will change your conviction that your opinion is just correct.\n * Even your argument about appeal to authority was based on an appeal to authority; by citing a web-site, but then you misapplied that, because the very argument they suggest is illogical, is the one you make; that of citing Dawkins as an authority on religion!\n * Further, you support Dawkins statements, but have shown no reasoned argument in support of them, other then a misapplication of your theory of 'authority'. You've made no logical appeal as to why he's correct in blaming all Judeo-Christian faiths for the type of thing that happened on 9/11.\n * You argue in favour of the theory of evolution; which for you is just one that 'change happens', basing this on a belief that it is backed by evidences, which you can catalogue; but are themselves are actually placed into working theories (by scientists); an effort you believe is irrelevant... thus making evolution the largest 'just-so' statement known to man.\n * Then you demand that I make an argument based on opinion, instead of evidence, and feel insulted when this would make someone 'opinionated'.\n \n In short, I've never argued against someone who makes such a massive series of self-refuting statements.",

I don't need to prove a truth of anything I say because everyone knows 2+2=4.\" You make this type of statement, and so does the Bootfitter - recall him saying he didn't need to define definitions, and I believe you joined in his mistake on the certainty of scientific method (though it may have just been him).\n\n If you decide, for fun, to make that claim, and I agree to entertain the new definition, then we could work logically from there. A monkey is a type of fish, would be consistent (if you mean fish ~ mammals). You see, you must disagree with my definitions, i.e. basic language, if you're going to show you aren't making illogical claims (Please do so, that's a more correct approach).\n \n \nIt is insulting. It's based on a logical fallacy couched in arrogance. Thus you make argument that are contradictory. And you do it so often, it's simply amazing.\n\n \n Amazing has nothing to offer this debate, couched in arrogance has nothing to offer, insulting has no relevance. Please just stick to the logic part, the rest emotional venting, probably with the aim of discrediting me based on character, which is fallacy, and which I don't appreciate. I think so many emotionally negative things about your claims that I could fill the forum, but I resist the urge the vast majority of the time.\n \n \n* You state with absoluteness about there being no truth based on faith, because it is devoid of evidence and full of assumption, but this is a statement of faith that you give, because you've yet to show that your statement is true; by the prime judge for you for truth; science. Unless you're willing to show me the science that shows that your version of science is science. Note, I stated it was a philosophy of science; the materialist one.\n\n \n Then I'll start a thread on just this, and I'm correct.\n \n \n* You've stated with absolute certainty that you are entirely knowable, based on an assumption that you just are! You've suggested that you are totally material in nature, because when you did attempt to show how you could be known - it was boiled down to a theory that if someone could catalogue all your atoms, they'd know you - even your personality. But then you started to talk about nature and nurture and this lead nowhere... that argument just stopped. Your atomist-educationalist argument has also gone nowhere. Further to this, your belief that science might one day be in a position to do something is based on faith.\n*\n Entirely knowable through reason, yes.\n \n\n Or, like aliens might exist, but trolls certainly don't based on your knowledge that this is already so, even without evidence for or against either statement. BUT you also say that the search for aliens isn't science, but science fiction! So you support scientists conducting something you call 'science fiction' based on the fact they have no evidence for aliens existing, nor of trolls, but one form of fiction is valid, and the other is not?!?\n* \n You have not defined \"trolls\". I have. A troll is supernatural..i.e. cannot be rationally demonstrated to exist or not exist, therefore, claims of existence with regards to trolls is irrational. We've been through this before, why do you mix so many posts...do the merits of your arguments on a single thread not carry enough weight? I implore you to stay on topic.\n \n \nYou've made statements regarding the subjectivity of faith, and how it pales in comparison to science; that science should, because of its objective nature, take precedence, also because its based on evidence, yet you despise Nazi science, based on an emotive argument, not on science!\n * You've stated love is real, but have not shown any scientific proof for it. Instead, you've given a number of philosophical arguments for it. Now you're back to claiming its real, insofar as such things are just atoms firing. But still, you can't show the science test for love. Thus you claim it's a material thing that science hasn't shown is material.\n*\n Faith is entirely subjective. It is entirely different than science, it's dogma. I have never said \"pales in comparison to\". Again, not relevant to our argument, but I enjoy disputing your false claims.\n \n \nYou argue against statements couched in authority then give a post about how you're an authority on psychology, which you've called hocus pocus, anyway.\n\n No, you strawman again. Mind being not in the physcal universe, is the same as magic, which I refer to as hocus pocus. I don't claim psychology is. I also don't claim to be an \"expert\", I clearly listed my very, very meager psychology credentials (2 courses, one in college, 1 textbook at home, a few magazines and books on the subject).\n \n \n* When I show evidence for a reasoned faith, you misapply the law of the excluded middle, and ignore those areas of science that have fuzzy logic etc.\n\n I applied it correctly. I showed you that fuzzy logic, adheres to all fundamental logic, by design.\n \n\n * You cite a support for evolution based on evidences, and yet when I argue based on evidences you state no amount of evidences will change your conviction that your opinion is just correct.\n*\n No, specially no amount of evidence can prove something true, if it's illogical, which is the case.\n \n \n Even your argument about appeal to authority was based on an appeal to authority; by citing a web-site, but then you misapplied that, because the very argument they suggest is illogical, is the one you make; that of citing Dawkins as an authority on religion!\n\n No, difference Montalban. I stated, using the words of the source, my position. You were then free to argue me, not the \"authority\". You didn't do this with regards to the jab about contradicting all theories of self from the great minds of psychology. Again, not relevant to this discussion.\n \n \n* Further, you support Dawkins statements, but have shown no reasoned argument in support of them, other then a misapplication of your theory of 'authority'. You've made no logical appeal as to why he's correct in blaming all Judeo-Christian faiths for the type of thing that happened on 9/11.\n\n \n He doesn't make a self-contradicting statement, which we have not gotten past with you. Again, not relevant to this discussion.\n \n \n \n* You argue in favour of the theory of evolution; which for you is just one that 'change happens', basing this on a belief that it is backed by evidences, which you can catalogue; but are themselves are actually placed into working theories (by scientists); an effort you believe is irrelevant... thus making evolution the largest 'just-so' statement known to man.\n\n Change does occur, what's your point? How is this related to this post?\n \n \n* Then you demand that I make an argument based on opinion, instead of evidence, and feel insulted when this would make someone 'opinionated'.\n\n Possibly, but I think I usually refer to your arguments as:\n Fallacy\n irrational\n illogical\n misleading\n not relevant\n too long\n based on little or no evidence.\n \n I don't use opinion that much, probably some, but I generally try to use the above.\n \n \nIn short, I've never argued against someone who makes such a massive series of self-refuting statements\n\n now THAT'S an absurd statement in my opinion. IN SHORT? YOU CALL THIS SHORT? Most of your post is on different topics, which is your method...i.e. lack of clarity is the friend of faith.\n \n Try to stick to the topic next time, that's the last time I'll entertain your massive posting of off-topic inaccuracies.\n \n -Mach",

   "No, that is an assumption. You mistake the difference between showing this is so, and re-stating that it is so. \n\n \nQuite the opposite. It's by definition.\n Try it with any opposite:\n I own the un-ownable.\n I smell the un-smellable\n I know the unknowable\n I reached the end of infinity\n\n And you can describe something as 'indescribable'. There's also a difference between saying \"I know the unknowable\" and \"I know of the unknowable.\"\n It's almost like saying evolution is based on 'the Survival of the Fittest\" :)\n But there are paradoxes in science...\n \"paradox (L: para=against; doxa=opinion) contrary to opinion; counter-intuitive, contradiction. Contrary to common belief or wisdom. The paradoxes in science, where one theory seemingly contradicts another, are the most fascinating areas of thought.

But for you, you'll just accept them because they're in the realm of science. They'll 'just' be justifiable, because of this. I can predict this, because it is the way you've shown in the past how you apply what is reasonable, and what is not.\n It's what you've done over the supposed paradox of fuzzy logic (acceptable) and 'reasoned faith (unacceptable), and on\n alien life (acceptable), and trolls (not acceptable)\n \nYou cannot even claim to make an assumption, or to communicate intelligibly unless you start with the basic logical premises, which you violate. So you're stuck with it, enjoy it.\n\n More assumption. And the arrogance of believing that it is just correct.\n \nOf course there are paradoxes. And they exist. I've stated how you are the same, yet you change. You are still Mach, but you are different from the Mach of childhood. \n\n \nlol, this isn't a paradox Montalban, it's your improper definition. I'm not \"the same\". The common definition of a person includes time, and the change that result from it.\n\n You are the same. You are still Mach. That part of you is still the same.\n \nYour obsessed with things being clearly in one category, or another, and have difficulty when things are blurred.\n\n \nOn the contrary, I remove your blurring of simple concepts by reducing them to root arguments, you should try it sometimes, it's similar to using math to make an equation shorter.\n\n How droll.\n \nIf you say you can't know anything of the unknowable, then you're making a paradox akin to describing something as being without description. But then you say with some conviction that there is nothing unknowable, and base this on your conviction that it is so. \n\n \nConviction, based on reason/logic. Yes. Which you deny, and you have every right to deny logic and reason, as you do so now.\n\n Well that's you stating it so again.\n \nWhat is truth?\n\n \nI exist\n\n Above you said you change, so truth changes. So for you, truth is not absolute (?)\n \nYes, and you believe all those that believe in God have solely irrational arguments.\n\n \nI have shown some of your claims to be self-contradictory claim, and therefore not rational, is that what you mean?\n\n No, you said so. That's not proving something.\n \nYou just re-state this again.\n\n \nBecause my argument doesn't have to change, unlike yours.\n\n What a retort\n \nI've shown you evidence that contradicts this, and what do you say about that? \"Appeal to authority\" and then misquote an authority on \"Appeal to authority\". \n\n \nTwo different issues, both of which are unrelated to this post. #1 you often \"appeal to reason\", your psychology claim that I contradicting \"the great psychologists\" was an appeal to authority.\n\n This is not so. For several different occasions you've stated that no amount of citations that I make means anything compared to your opinion, oft re-stated.\n Post #21 I said\n \nI often do give my own words. Such as what you're reading now. However, unlike you I prefer reasoned debate that includes sources. I know Americans love the sound of their own voices (which itself is an opinion), but I had no idea just how much. The authority of your own voice is just your opinion\n\n you responded post #22 with a general comment about ALL of my comments as an appeal to authority, and what we were discussing specifically was Dawkins authority to talk on religious matters. Therefore you're wrong (again)\n \n In contrast, your constant posting of long links that are not in your own words is often unnecessary, and not always an appeal to authority, are you clear now?\n\n See above\n \nYour continual re-statements without proof are examples of circular reasoning.\n\n \nProved above, for what..the tenth time?\n\n Again, you have such a high value of your opinion, that you believe if you state it, then it's 'fact', irrefutable, conclusive, etc. And therefore you've mistaken statement for proof.\n \nThis is an illogical assumption. Because you can state one thing that none disagree on, doesn't mean that everything you say is also of the same degree of certainty. It is gross arrogance to do so. You are arguing for a truth of one thing, by stating the truth of another. \n\n \nIt IS, by definition.\n\n What is, by what definition?\n \nArrogance is irrelevant, only what we can reasonably justify is relevant, we're trying to reach conclusions, not attack character...rather, I'm trying to do this, I cannot speak for you.\n\n Rubbish, ye of little insight.

I have. A troll is supernatural..i.e. cannot be rationally demonstrated to exist or not exist\n\n That is completely false. I said that legends can be based on reality. There are legends of trolls, and of super-natural beings (which might have been aliens). Therefore the fact that they are legendary, and given certain attributes does not mean either one or the other does not exist. I also stated that the 'gods' may have been aliens, who through technology would have seemed 'god-like'. You do yourself no justice in making such a false claim.\n \n , therefore, claims of existence with regards to trolls is irrational. We've been through this before, why do you mix so many posts...do the merits of your arguments on a single thread not carry enough weight?

I have never said \"pales in comparison to\". Again, not relevant to our argument, but I enjoy disputing your false claims.\n\n Talk about dishonest. You've spent the best part of a month berating religion exactly because you say it's on such shaky ground; blind faith. You really need to keep track of your own arguments.\n [quote=Montaban]You argue against statements couched in authority then give a post about how you're an authority on psychology, which you've called hocus pocus, anyway. \n \nNo, you strawman again.\n\n No, you referred to psychology as hocus pocus. When I talked about personality, you said it's not just hocus pocus, and I was dealing with a psychology term. And You referred to exobiology as 'science fiction'.\n \nMind being not in the physical universe, is the same as magic, which I refer to as hocus pocus. I don't claim psychology is.\n\n You do, but saying that. Not all psychologists claim the mind is wholly material, as you do.\n \nI also don't claim to be an \"expert\", I clearly listed my very, very meagre psychology credentials (2 courses, one in college, 1 textbook at home, a few magazines and books on the subject).\n\n True, you're not an expert, but you've endeavoured to show you have authority on this subject. You set yourself up as having more authority on the matter... despite missing the many theorists who aren't materialists such as yourself.\n [quote=Montalban]* When I show evidence for a reasoned faith, you misapply the law of the excluded middle, and ignore those areas of science that have fuzzy logic etc. \n \nI applied it correctly. I showed you that fuzzy logic, adheres to all fundamental logic, by design.\n\n A slight skewing of the issue. You claimed by misapplying the law of the excluded middle that there's no such thing as 'reasoned faith', even though 'reasoned faith' is neither reason, nor faith. I suggested that there are things 'in between', and fuzzy logic is one, and now you concede that this is 'logical', but not 'reasoned faith'. As I say, you make such self-refuting statements.\n \n* You cite a support for evolution based on evidences, and yet when I argue based on evidences you state no amount of evidences will change your conviction that your opinion is just correct. \n\n \nNo, specially no amount of evidence can prove something true, if it's illogical, which is the case.\n\n You just said evolution is illogical!\n \nEven your argument about appeal to authority was based on an appeal to authority; by citing a web-site, but then you misapplied that, because the very argument they suggest is illogical, is the one you make; that of citing Dawkins as an authority on religion! \n\n \nNo, difference Montalban.

   "\"I know something of the unknowable\"\n\n \nthis is self-contradictory, is illogical, is an irrational claim.\n\n Yawn! So you keep repeating. Obviously the very act of arguing against me means that my definition of 'unknowable' doesn't suit your definition of 'unknowable' and if you've defined 'unknowable' then ipso facto you know something of it. You thus refute yourself. You are in fact creating the similar paradox I stated earlier, of describing something as indescribable.\n \nOne cannot proceed based on this self-contradictory statement, any subsequent conclusions would be based on an illogical premise.\n\n Yet you continually do this. And your proof is restating a statement about a statement.\n \nWhy:\n Law of Contradiction: \n \"Nothing can be both A, and not-A\"\n \"Nothing can be both true, and false\"\n\n Finally, an attempt to test your theory! It only took you weeks of mantra to get to this point. There is, of course, paradoxes. I pointed out examples such as you both changing and staying the same.\n You are Mach. Arguably, if you know him, your father will recognise you as having been Mach when you were 1 year old, when you were 10 years old, and now. Yet you have changed. Yet you are still Mach. No one else is you! Only you are you; that is a constant. Again, you simply pretend that such realities exist.\n That doesn't mean the same as 'all of Mach is knowable' and 'all of Mach is unknowable'. That would indeed be a contradiction. I said some of you is known, some is knowable, some is unknown, and some is unknowable.\n I stated this so many times, such as #120 \"Lets discuss the actual reason creationists object to evolution\"\n \nSo, \"part of God\" is not knowable.\n\n \nYes, as part of you is not knowable.\n\n and #116 of \" Lets discuss the actual reason creationists object to evolution\"\n \n1. Since you cannot rationally define god if it's unknowable, \n\n \nGod is knowable, just not in His entirety. I know something about you, but I can never know you like you know you. That I know something about you, and that this is outside the realm of science does not make it nonsense.\n\n However I do concede that I haven't made this clear at all times\n post #12 \" Creation is irrational to begin with\"\n \nIt is disappointing that you would continue with this mistake. I said that God is both knowable and unknowable. You simply think that equates to the same thing, and thus you argue against what you believe I say, rather than what I said.\n\n However I've give an example of you in post #150 of \" Lets discuss the actual reason creationists object to evolution\" showing different aspects of you that are known, unknown, knowable, and unknowable.\n \nYou are the same, yet you always change. In that, you are still you (stable), but you are different (hopefully) from when you were five years old (changing).\n\n This itself shows two different aspects of you, one stable, but one changing.\n I then went on...\n \nYou are known - known as Mach.\n You are knowable - we could learn more about you\n You are unknown - there are aspects about you I don't know\n You are unknowable - it is impossible to know you completely... the way you feel, remember, react, know, understand, and the fact you're always changing, learning more things, forgetting some, feeling new sensations etc.\n\n \nI disagree strongly with you that things can't contain elements of both. You fail to see that you too, are essentially unknowable to me, and I to you.\n\n \nLet's test the claim, even though it's obviously illogical at a glance:\n By definition, unknowable: That which cannot be known\n Your claim \"I know something of the unknowable\"\n\n No, more precisely I claim that there are aspects of God that is knowable, and that there are aspects of God that are unknowable. I stated that God has made some aspects of Himself known; through the person of Jesus Christ, and that in His totality, He is unknowable. You have changed this by means of \"Mach perception\" into being \"Everything about Mach is both knowable and unknowable\" and \"Everything about God is both knowable and unknowable\" and then you've proceeded to argue against that. Perhaps I should state myself more clearly.\n You claim absolutely nothing is unknowable. And the basis for this assumption rests on two 'proofs'\n a) you say so, repeatedly\n b) you assume that not only are you nothing but atoms, but that even if science can't use this to know you in totality now, it might well, one day.\n \n\n So, something unknowable, in the claim, can be known, and obviously violates the law of contradiction. \n\n No. TO know that you can't know something of the unknowable is to give it a quality of description, and by describing it, you define it, therefore you know something of it.\n If I say \"I know nothing of quantum mechanics\" then I have stated that what I know of it is that what ever it is, it is something I don't know. I can thus tell you with certainty that I know nothing of it. As I stated, it's akin to saying something is 'indescribable'. You have described it, attributed to it a definition as being beyond description. That you persist on ignoring paradoxes as they appear and claim that they don't exist is terribly amusing.\n \nSo, your rebuttal is:\n\n \nNo, that is an assumption. You mistake the difference between showing this is so, and re-stating that it is so. \n\n Actually, what's been your rebuttal. \"NO, your wrong!\"\n \nPardon me, I assumed you knew both the English language, and the basics of logic. Since you obviously don't, or don't care to use them unless asked, I've detailed it above, just for you.\n\n Now you have 'detailed it', but I am not a mind reader like you, so when, up to this point in time, you just re-state 'you are wrong, I am right', then you've not proven something. That you would now retrospectively claim that I am wrong; that is, prior to your explanation is completely ludicrous!\n \nIf you disagree, please show your evidence as to:\n The law of contradiction is illogical\n The above statement in English, given basic definitions in English, does not violate logic.\n\n The law of contradiction can work in a pure logical environment, such as Maths. We are not mathematical figures.\n \nAnd you can describe something as 'indescribable'.\n\n \nYou can. However, logically it's fallacy, we do not need another example of fallacy, we have the original claim, it will suffice.\n\n It is not a fallacy. Here you go again just making 'just-so' statements. For you to assume paradoxes are wrong is quite stupid; and you've done this by calling a couple of them here 'fallacies'.\n \nthere are paradoxes in science \n\n \n#1 The claim \" there are paradoxes in science\" either contradicts the law of logic, or does not. Which are you claiming? Do you supply this as proof that the law of contradiction is invalid, or just as a neat FYI?\n\n No. I supply it as proof that paradoxes exist. You claim that things must be either one thing or the other; and this is akin to the law you are stating, but not everything applies to this logic, even in science, where some things can seem contradictory.\n A classic paradox is the statement \"There are exceptions to every rule\".\n \n#2 Something that \"seems\" like a paradox, or that with an inaccurate definition is considered a paradox, is not proof of the existence of a paradox. In fact, any such claim would HAVE to use as premise, the basic laws of logic to even form a logical claim. Worse still, all of your links are guesses, except the first, which by your admission, does not make the claim that it's observing a violation of the 2nd law of thermodynamics. You use the word \"seemingly contradicts\". Which, does not imply contradiction. If it did, and if you were correct, you'd overthrow the law of thermodynamics, or the law of contradiction, either would probably win you a Nobel prize.\n -Mach\n\n SO, are you stating that paradoxes don't exist, they just seem to exist?",

   "Yawn! So you keep repeating. Obviously the very act of arguing against me means that my definition of 'unknowable' doesn't suit your definition of 'unknowable' and if you've defined 'unknowable' then ipso facto you know something of it. You thus refute yourself. You are in fact creating the similar paradox I stated earlier, of describing something as indescribable.\n \n\n \n I don't claim I know anything of the unknowable.\n The claim we are debating is:\n Definition: Unknowable: That which cannot be known\n \n --< \"I know something of the unknowable\"\n \n Is a logical contradiction. Refuse it again without proof and we conclude. If you wish to use a different word to describe your belief, do so, but do not contradict logic just to try and be correct, it's the closest thing to evil I know of, it's the same as lying.\n \n I don't claim to know anything of the unknowable, my statement is not a contradiction. I do not claim the unknowable exists, I do not claim anything I know IS unknowable. So you're back to being illogical, or incorrect, you choose.\n \n \nYet you continually do this. And your proof is restating a statement about a statement.\n\n No Montalban, you continually deny logic and reason, yet the logic and reason remain the evidence of your illogical or irrational conclusions. Do you want me to use different colored text or bold faced to mix-it up? Because you being wrong, and the evidence to show it is so, will not change.\n \n \nFinally, an attempt to test your theory! It only took you weeks of mantra to get to this point. There is, of course, paradoxes. \n\n Your use of paradox is silly at best. A paradox is not refutation of the law of contradiction, why would you even suggest that? Furthermore, paradox is defined in such a way that it is not even capable of being used as proof in such a way:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox\n \n \nThus a paradox is (theoretically) solvable given more information, while a contradiction (literally, \"speak contrary\") is (theoretically) insolvable on the basis of the information that has already been received. In common parlance the terms are sometimes used synonymously.\n\n \n A paradox, in reality, is solvable given more information, but a CONTRADICTION, i.e. Montalban's claim, is insolvable. Why would you offer up as proof that contradictions don't exist, the paradox? Red herring, or just out of ignorance? I can forgive ignorance. I mistakenly assumed you were trying to claim contradictions exist, since that would be the only way to show logic is faulty, but alas.\n \n \n\n I pointed out examples such as you both changing and staying the same.\n You are Mach.\n ^^ aside from the other rejections of your claim that I make, we can default to the above. Even if it were a paradox, it's no refutation of logic, and certainly not proof that a contradiction is logical.\n \n \n \nNo. TO know that you can't know something of the unknowable is to give it a quality of description, and by describing it, you define it, therefore you know something of it.\n\n \n No dear sir. \"I know of the unknowable\", the statement is irrational to begin with, you just can't seem to grasp logic, which doesn't surprise me. It's obvious in everything posted by you...either that or they are entirely, intentionally, deceitful claims. You claim knowledge, which implies knowing truth. I claim no knowledge of the unknowable. Basic, simple, english language and logic.\n \n \nSO, are you stating that paradoxes don't exist, they just seem to exist\n\n \n Contradictions \"seem\" to exist, but do not, so the word paradox is used \"seemingly contradictory\"...but ultimately not a contradiction. Which is also why paradox is irrelevant to a dicussion on basic, fundemental language and logic. \n \n -Mach",

Science cannot, as you claim, \"explain\" everything, and it has no natural explanation for the \n predictions made in scripture. How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass? Also, how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people (uneducated in the ways of modern science) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today. How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently?\n \n Ecclesiastes 1:6\n The wind goes toward the south,\n And turns around to the north;\n The wind whirls about continually,\n And comes again on its circuit.  \n\n \n Wind goes north, south, east, and west, and it's always blowing somewhere, how does this relate to any kind of a scientific understanding of wind?\n \n Record the conversation of any two Joe Sixpacks in a coffee shop as they talk about the weather and you have about the same level of science involved.\n \n \nHow did they know that the earth \"hangs on nothing\" when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility?\n \n Job 26:7\n He stretches out the north over empty space;\n He hangs the earth on nothing.  \n \n \n What does \"hangs on nothing\" mean? Really, what does it mean? In context? Your interpretation?\n \n Do you think the Earth \"hangs on nothing\"?\n \n \nHow did they know that the \"vapors\" of the earth rise to create moisture, that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil?\n \n Jeremiah 10:13\n When He utters His voice,\n There is a multitude of waters in the heavens:\n \"And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.\n He makes lightning for the rain,\n He brings the wind out of His treasuries.\"  \n \n \n I touched on this in my last post. This passage is a simple observation of a thunderstorm. It doesn't imply any understanding of why thunderstorms happen or how, simply that they've observed the process. If you're going to tell me that this passage contains the key to the hydrological cycle, I'm going to tell you that you're seriously deluded, it doesn't even accurately represent the formation of rain and thunderstorms.\n \n \nHydrothermal vents[4] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BC-more than 3,000 years before their discovery by science.\n \n Genesis 7:11\n In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.  \n \n \n If you can get past the fact that Noah is 600 years old, I guess it's not much of a leap to think that \"fountains of the deep\" equals a valid description of hydrothermal vents.\n \n \nBut you may need to take a few classes on how to analyze historical documents and Hermeneutics before you get it.\n\n \n If the evidence is so weak that you have to take classes on the subject in order to be able to \"see\" the connection, that's not very good evidence.\n \n \nEven though the Bible is not a scientific text book and doesn't purport to be, nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate. In addition, many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible. It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them.\n\n \n If the Bible is not scientific and doesn't purport to be, why are you here parading it as a book filled with scientific data that is in no way scientifically inaccurate?

   "\"(Chaos is) the unpredictable evolution of the behavior of many nonlinear dynamical systems. Because of their sensitive dependence on initial conditions, the error in predicting the future states of such systems grows exponentially with time, so that the future states of such systems becomes essentially unknowable in a relatively brief period of time. Although chaos means unpredictability, it should not be understood to mean that the system was not or is not determined (Masterpasqua & Perna, 1997, p. 304).\"\n http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2001/BrainsBodiesBifurcations.htm\n \"Chaos theory grounds a post-modern science that is unpredictable, hence unknowable to the degree of precision demanded by modern science. Indeed; the essence and presence of a factor in a given degree cannot be used to predict, linearly, the behavior of a system; bird, atom, molecule, photon, person, species, or society. No longer may we use formal axiomatic theory in conjunction with binary logic with which to model reality, predict and thus control system dynamics. Indeed control itself becomes a casualty of post-modern science.\"\n http://www.critcrim.com/redfeather/chaos/001intro.html\n [quote=Montalban]So you keep repeating. Obviously the very act of arguing against me means that my definition of 'unknowable' doesn't suit your definition of 'unknowable' and if you've defined 'unknowable' then ipso facto you know something of it. You thus refute yourself. You are in fact creating the similar paradox I stated earlier, of describing something as indescribable.\n \n I don't claim I know anything of the unknowable.\n\n Yes, you do. You state it doesn't exist. You've already begun to define it. If you didn't, we'd not be able to have this debate. You must be able to know something of it to determine it with the title 'unknowable'.\n We can describe something as \"indescribable\"\n We can imagine something to be \"unimaginable\"\n We can know that something is \"unknowable\"\n We can even think something is \"unthinkable\"\n People bear unbearable pain. It is the limit of language. How do we describe God with such language? Well we can't. We can't put into words all that is God, because He is, in His totality, beyond our experiences.\n \nThe claim we are debating is:\n Definition: Unknowable: That which cannot be known\n --< \"I know something of the unknowable\"\n Is a logical contradiction. Refuse it again without proof and we conclude. If you wish to use a different word to describe your belief, do so, but do not contradict logic just to try and be correct, it's the closest thing to evil I know of, it's the same as lying.\n\n I stated that you consist of unknowable elements, so does God. God can be known, in that He has revealed Himself (not in totality) to us. And you do this too, by posting on this board.\n You claim that this is the same as making an illogical statement.\n Yet I could say \"There is something that a liquid, it is not a gas, or a solid; it can't be liquid-gas-solid at the same time. That would be illogical; but that's the argument you think I am making.

   "\"\n Yes, you do. You state it doesn't exist. You've already begun to define it.\n \n\n \n A square circle. I have defined it, but I do not, and cannot rationally claim it exists. Yet you seem to think that defining a word, implies existence or truth, both of which are fallacy, strawman, claim that I have claimed existence, when this is obviously not the case, and cannot be logically concluded.\n \n \n If you didn't, we'd not be able to have this debate. You must be able to know something of it to determine it with the title 'unknowable'.\n\n Yes, if the word is not defined, we could not have the debate. However, as shown above, defining does not imply truth or existence. I do not claim anything is unknowble, you do Montalban, burden of proof is with you, yet your claim is irrational. You are making a defense by denying logic, which will not get you anywhere in a rational debate.\n \n \nWe can describe something as \"indescribable\"\n We can imagine something to be \"unimaginable\"\n We can know that something is \"unknowable\"\n We can even think something is \"unthinkable\"\n People bear unbearable pain. It is the limit of language. How do we describe God with such language? Well we can't. We can't put into words all that is God, because He is, in His totality, beyond our experiences.\n\n We can imagine any number of things that could be irrational if we claimed they were true statements.\n \n If you know something to be unknowable, you make a contradictory claim, it's illogical.\n \n If you think of somethiing unthinkable, you contradict yourself, your claim is illogical.\n \n Pain, if beared, is not by definintion, unbearable, so it's another contradiction. It's sloppy use of language that will not save your illogical argument.\n \n \n \nI stated that you consist of unknowable elements, so does God. God can be known, in that He has revealed Himself (not in totality) to us. And you do this too, by posting on this board.\n You claim that this is the same as making an illogical statement.\n Yet I could say \"There is something that a liquid, it is not a gas, or a solid; it can't be liquid-gas-solid at the same time. That would be illogical; but that's the argument you think I am making. But, parts of this substance can be liquid, gas and solid.\"\n\n And if the claim is irrational, then we wouldn't be able to discuss it rationally. Furthermore, if any one of liquid, gas, or solid, was an irrational concept, your entire claim of \"something\" would be irrational, again. Combinations do not save you, it's both obvious, and I've shown it to you.\n \n Bob is defined as :Having an unknowable creature in his belly, solid (bone), and having liquid (blood).\n \n Test: We can measure Bob's bone mass - True\n Test: We can measure the liquid volume in Bob - True\n Test: I know bob has an unknowable creature in his belly, I make a self-contradicting statement.\n \n Result:: the concept \"Bob\" is irrational, by definition, since part of the definiton is an irrational claim. Just as your claim of God is irrational, by definition. Why not stick to your original claim, what will an analogy with the same excact logical flaw change logically? Nothing.\n \n \nYou, \"Mach\" contain liquid (blood), solid (bone), gas (air) at the same time. Not one of these 'is' you, but combined these things which are not of each other's state, are you; as you believe you are only material.\n BUT you'd have to argue \"That's illogical, how can I be solid, gas and liquid at the same time, and still be me?\"\n\n No, the claim is silly at best. Mach is defined as containing matter, which may exist in various states, by definition. If you wish to choose a limted definition that does not include the physical body, do so. And it won't make any sense, similar to your claim.\n \n Your links on science are intriguing, good for another post, yet they do not change the basic logic which you violate, which is what we're interested in here.\n \n So, to summarize, since you're all over the place as usual.\n \n Montalban's claim : I know the unknowable\n ====================================\n Is logically self-contraditing, and to make such a claim as true, is irrational.\n ====================================================\n \n Montalban's argument against logic in this post is:\n \n 1. Chaos theory is a theory (irrelvant)\n 2. Defining the word unknowable implies existence (fallacy, think square circle)\n 3. More self-contradicting, illogical claims (illogical, he can think of the unthinkable)\n 4. Bad logic/analogy (Thinks if part of something is illogical, the whole can be logical)\n \n I'd rather you not continue wasting time. Why would you need 4 different approaches when all you need to do is show \"I know the unknowable\" is not a logically self-contradictory statement? I'm either correct, or incorrect. Please prove to us that my logic is faulty, based on the agreed upon definitions. If you cannot (and you have not), your claim remains, illogical.\n \n -Mach",

And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food\"\n \n One contracition, among thousands of inaccuracies. Unfortunately for your argument, the bible is a man-written text in support of faith, not reason. It does not need to make sense, it is interepereted, in support of a particular faith, which is hopefully something that gives you comfort, and NOT something that interferes with reason in your daily life. I see from your posts it IS interfering, wheras I see other religious poster who seem to have no problem having faith for their own benefit, but do not attempt to mix the two (reason and faith).\n \n -Mach\n\n \n I can understand your ignorance here. You see, you haven't taken the time to find out what's going on, yet you think you've got it figured. The passages you quote stem from a common literary technique.\n \n Genesis is a day by day explanation of the six days of creation. Genesis two is a recap and a more detailed explanation of the sixth day - the day Adam and Eve were created. The recap can be seen in Genesis 2:4 - but you conveniently ignore it: This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven.  \n \n Then Moses goes on to detail the creation account. Here's the breakdown:\n \n Genesis 1\n - Day one - heavens and earth are created. \"Let there be light.\" Day and Night. - Day two - Atmospheric waters separated from earth waters.\n - Day three - Land appears separating the seas. Vegetation is made. \n - Day four - Sun, moon, stars are made. \n - Day five - Sea life and birds are made.\n - Day six - Land animals, creeping things, and man (male and female) are made. \n Genesis 2\n States heaven and earth were created. no plant yet on earth, no rain yet, no man. but, a mist rose watering the surface of the ground. Then the Lord formed man from dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. Then God made Eve. \n \n I'm sure you've seen this type of technique in some other books you've read. Feel free to see it as a contradiction, but it's not. Given the fact that you don't take time to research what you read, it's likely that you've been duped not only by other claims of Bible contradictions, but it's easy to see how you've been duped by evolutionary theory as well.",

Most people I know are content with their faith, and need no justfication through mudane means. You argue some things CAN be inconsistent, yet you don't accept it.

   "I'm sure you'll see it any way you like, I don't really aim to convince you of things which you need to proof to belive in.\n \n Actually it's from a book written by a former evangelical preacher (Dan Barker).\n \n How about another one to add to the list of contradictions:\n \n Has God ever been seen?\n \n John 1:19 \"No man hat seen God at any time\"\n Exodus 33:20 Thou canst not see my face; for there shall be no man see me, and live\"\n John 4:12 No man hath seen God at any time\n \n vs\n \n Genesis 32:30 \"For I have seen God face to face\"\n Exodus 33:11 \"And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend\"\n Isaiah 6:1 \"In the year that king Uzziah dided I as also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.\n Job 42:5 \"I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee\"\n \n \n Why does the bible NEED to be non-contradictory? It's the bible, it's a book of faith, it need not follow any edicts of reason.\n \n -Mach\n\n \n Once again, you may understand what evolutionists have fed you, but you're woefully ignorant of simple concepts of literary hermeneutics. Not to be unkind, but you really need to work on this.\n \n The \"problem\" with Genesis as you claim is not a problem at all. The \"contradiction\" is the result of the two passages being taken out of context. For example: If I say Tom is rich, and then I say Tom is poor, am I contradicting myself? Not necessarily. It's possible that Tom is poor financially, but rich spirtually. In the case of Tom, both statements might flatly, on the surface, contradict each other, but at the same time both are absolutely true. The reason is that the two terms are not being used in the same sense.\n \n The same goes for the scriptures you quote. If you consider the scriptures in their appropriate context, they are not contradicting because they are not speaking of God being \"seen\" in the same sense.\n \n In the case of Moses, he saw a buring bush, not the actual face of God. He saw an image of God that we humans can deal with. The bush was a representation of God - not too hard to understand. Moses was fearful because he considered it \"seeing\" God. - Exodus 3:6b\n \n Job \"saw\" God in a \"whirlwind\". Was it actually God? Hardly. God spoke from it, but it wasn't God. He saw a manifestation of God that humans could comprehend.\n \n Job \"saw\" God as he wrestled with an angle Gen:32:24-30. He wrestled for quite awhile, and then finally said \"I have seen God face to face\". Does the scripture state that God was there? No. It says God sent a representative.\n \n No, what you've done is taken a few words from the Bible in an attempt to make the point that the Bible contradicts itself. They weren't proper quotes taken in context. Your technique is common, and it's hard to tell if you did it on purpose, or if you're duped by those who claim the Bible contains contradictions by ignorance, or by design.",

   "[quote=Montalban]That's a different argument (besides the fact you've not defined anything). You have made two statements\n 1. There is nothing unknowable\n and\n 2. You can't know something of the unknowable.\n \nYou're still not correct.\n We have defined unknowable a number of times.\n Unknowable: cannot be known\n\n Therefore you can know something of the unknowable. You've just provided the example that refutes you!\n \nYou have claimed god is real, and unknowable\n To claim knowledge of the unknowable is self-contradictory.\n\n Yawn, again you keep repeating this. You not only refute yourself by providing an example of knowledge of the unknowable, but you gave an example of what is unknowable, by telling me I'd never be able to know you!\n \nYour statements above are also irrational. I do not claim there is nothing unknowable, merely that your statement, \"I know something of the unknowable\" is illogical. I do not make such claims, you do, which is why there is a debate.\n\n Then debate me. Simply repeating 'no it's not', is not a debate.\n \nYou've skipped between these two so quick \n\n \nNo, you just don't understand that \"knowledge of the unknowable\" is a logical contradiction. How obvious does an argument need to be with you?\n\n Even this statement is to know something of the unknowable!\n \n. I stated in refutation of the second argument that you have in fact come to 'know' something of it, by defining it. \n\n \nWhich is fallacy. I don't describe \"it\" as unknowable, or anything. We start with a definition:\n unknowable: cannot be known\n And your claim \"I know something of the unknowable\"\n Don't make up other arguments, it's strawman. Stick to your contradictory statement. And your defense of it, if you can.\n\n You're funny. You repeat the refutation. What do you know about the unknowable? You know that it can't be known! Therefore you know something of the unknowable; it can't be known!\n \nNo, its a refutation of your illogical statement \"You can't know anything about the unknowable\", which is in fact to make a statement that is a paradox, because it is at least one thing you know about the unknowable; it's beyond knowing. \n\n \nI don't say \"you can't know anything of the unknowable\", and if I do, I'm incorrect. YOUR CLAIM, \"I know something of the unknowable\" is irrational, is what I am arguing, as you well know. It cannot be tested for truth.\n\n SO you refute yourself again. You have said you can't know something about the unknowable, and I say you can! You know, you know it's unknowable. I can, I know it's unknowable.\n \nSo you keep saying, based on your belief that it doesn't exist, based on your belief that it doesn't exist, which is based on your belief that it doesn't exist.\n\n \nI don't hold a belief with regards to reality and the unknowable. You do.\n\n Yes, you do. You claim\n a) it doesn't exist\n b) it can't be known\n Therefore you provide two pieces of information about it, that you know of.\n \n\n Yet you just claim that it is illogical \n\n \nNo, I prove that it is illogical.\n\n No you don't :) You just say its illogical\n If you reckon you can prove it, show me the science for it (as that seems to be your be-all and end-all for proof)\n unknowable: cannot be known\n \nYour claim \"I know something of the unknowable\"\n Your claim contradicts itself, and is illogical.\n\n Well, you claim that you can't know anything of it, which is to suggest that you do know something of it; that it's beyond knowing, therefore you refute yourself. :)\n \n- based on Law of Contradiction\n Nothing can be both \"A\" and \"not-A\"\n Knowable : Not Knowable.\n\n But you refute yourself.\n \nYou both state that you can't know anything about it, which itself is to state something about it! \n\n \nI certainly don't, it's the definition of the word. I can say \"square circle\", yet I don't claim I have knowledge of it.\n\n Saying a word is not to define it. Define a square circle, so I know whether it exists or not.\n \nYOU, not me Montalban, claim to have knowledge of the unknowable, please do keep things straight.\n\n And so do you.\n [quote=Montalban]Then your argument is not based on whether something exists, but on whether it can be tested. Therefore, until the advent of microscopes, Bob did not have bacteria in him, because you couldn't test for bacteria (Note also the first ideas of atomic theory was first thought up by the Ancient Greeks (though this is not to do with atomic power)). Your world again, your test for 'truth' rests not on logic, but science. \n \nDepends. You argued in another post that logic was part of science, which is it?\n\n Logic is a part of science. You seem to be confused that they are totally synonymous. Logic is a part of science, but so is non-logic, such as intuition.\n \nIt matters not, because I will accept whatever reasonable claims about where logic is categorized, as long as you do accept logic, which you have not.\n\n It does matter, because you've switched debate to state that if it can't be tested, it doesn't exist! Therefore, until microbes were actually tested for, they didn't exist. They were beyond 'knowledge' and therefore non-existent.\n \nBUT you'd have to argue \"That's illogical, how can I be solid, gas and liquid at the same time, and still be me?\"\n\n \nNo, I most certainly would not. Any definition of \"Mach\" assumes the matter of which I am composed. Mach - handle which is associated with a human. Human -: a bipedal primate mammal (Homo sapiens) (Webster online)\n\n So you've no problem that you contain elements that are at odds?\n \nYes, last I checked mammals have blood and bone. Anything else? Of course, you're not \"human\", you're \"divine\", right? I mean, the dictionary definition of you being a PRIMATE...does that fit with your faith?\n\n Ditto. You say God can't exist because I've stated that He is both in part knowable and unknowable, which is impossible to you because these statements are contradictions, yet you contain substance that is solid, and that which is gas, and that which is liquid. These go together to make you, even though these states are separate states.\n \nIt is the claim YOU made, that something can't contain elements that are contradictory.\n\n \nNo, it's irrational to claim this. To claim something of the unknowable, is a contradiction, do get it right please.\n\n No, you claimed that God can't have elements known and unknowable. Your argument is falling apart, but is highly amusing.\n \nWhat's this got to do with the fact that a body, in its entirety can contain many different states? \n\n \nWhat does a body containing matter have to do with your self-contradicting statement? Nothing, exactly.\n\n See, you can't face the refutation against your argument.\n \nNo, they show that in science, people recognise the unknowable, which you claim doesn't exist, based on your belief that it doesn't exist, repeated. \n\n \nAppeal to authority, nice, and fallacy.\n\n Your rebuttal shows you don't understand this. Your own citation of 'appeal to authority' suggests that when someone appeals to someone to be authoritative over a subject that they don't have expertise in, is 'appeal to authority'. I cited science to say something about science. But, heck, no amount of evidence is going to move you from your irrational statement is it?\n \n You still have not the logic that clearly shows your claim to be a contradiction, and thus, illogical.\n\n Not only have I done so, I've provided evidence for it.\n Your response\n \"No you haven't\"\n \nYou would say that, especially as I provided evidence from science that directly refutes your oft stated opinion. \n\n \nNo, you haven't overturned logic, I'm still waiting though.\n\n Your right, I haven't over-turned logic. You have. You can wait or you like, but no amount of evidence, as stated by yourself, will make you change your mind. Thus, you are irrational (by your own definition). You have no interest in science except insofar as the little bits agree with your own beliefs.\n \n Post 8 \" Faith cannot separate (sic) truth from falsity\"\n \nyou claim to know my motives (you cannot) \n\n Then you've argued against yourself about unknowables\n \n What a hoot!\n \n I've stated that Mach makes more refutations of his own arguments than any one else!",

I wouldn't know, only you have made such irrational claims, and refuse to admit you contradict yourself.\n\n If you claim the unknowable can't exist, then you have again attributed some more knowledge about it.\n \nNo you don't You just say its illogical\n If you reckon you can prove it, show me the science for it (as that seems to be your be-all and end-all for proof)\n\n \nunknowable: cannot be known\n\n Prove it by science\n \nWell, you claim that you can't know anything of it, which is to suggest that you do know something of it; that it's beyond knowing, therefore you refute yourself. \n\n You claim this. Again saying something and proving it are different things.\n \nSo you've no problem that you contain elements that are at odds?\n\n \nYet no elements are \"at odds\", so your question is both meaningless, and, irrelevant to your defense. Please to at least attempt to stay on topic.\n\n They are at odds. They are elements that are in different states. How can you contain elements that are in different states, but you won't allow for yourself to have both knowable and unknowable qualities.\n [quote=Montalban]See, you can't face the refutation against your argument.Your rebuttal shows you don't understand this. Your own citation of 'appeal to authority' suggests that when someone appeals to someone to be authoritative over a subject that they don't have expertise in, is 'appeal to authority'. I cited science to say something about science. But, heck, no amount of evidence is going to move you from your irrational statement is it. \n \nEvidence? OMG. Did I miss something? *Scrolls back through threads*. You mean you deleted your evidence that your claim was not contradictory?\n\n Quite dishonest, but still fun coming from you. I cited science that can give examples of things that are unknowable, such as in the experiment with regard Turing machines, and chaos theory.\n You obviously don't think I'll repost what I put in #63\n \"(Chaos is) the unpredictable evolution of the behavior of many nonlinear dynamical systems. Because of their sensitive dependence on initial conditions, the error in predicting the future states of such systems grows exponentially with time, so that the future states of such systems becomes essentially unknowable in a relatively brief period of time. Although chaos means unpredictability, it should not be understood to mean that the system was not or is not determined (Masterpasqua & Perna, 1997, p. 304).\"\n http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/20...ifurcations.htm\n \"Chaos theory grounds a post-modern science that is unpredictable, hence unknowable to the degree of precision demanded by modern science. Indeed; the essence and presence of a factor in a given degree cannot be used to predict, linearly, the behavior of a system; bird, atom, molecule, photon, person, species, or society. No longer may we use formal axiomatic theory in conjunction with binary logic with which to model reality, predict and thus control system dynamics. Indeed control itself becomes a casualty of post-modern science.\"\n http://www.critcrim.com/redfeather/chaos/001intro.html\n \n And the real hoot is that you then claim when a science site deals with science that it is a 'appeal to authority' This is because you are totally irrational. Your own science disagrees with you, but you won't listen. I love showing you evidence, you love re-statement.\n \n I've deleted the rest of your boring post wherein you just say \"No it's not\".\n If you want to argue, then fine.\n \n So, in summary, you provide some knowledge of the unknowable. You give an example of something unknowable; yourself (despite attempting to argue against that for a while). I provide evidence too, which you both pretend to ignore, and then misapply the 'claim to authority' statement. I love this forum :)\n \n And how are you going to respond?\n It's illogical\n It's illogical\n It's illogical\n You sound like you cover your ears and cry \"Make it go away\"\n \n And let's not lose sight of the fact that your very thread itself is irrational, because it attacks all creation accounts out of hand, regardless of their source",

   "I generally agree with you here, Milo. However, how do we KNOW what context is appropriate to consider when reading the Bible? As Unkerpaulie often points out... If we are to read the Bible with a literal interpretation, then doesn't the word 'see' mean 'to see with the eyes'?\n \n Alternatively, if you can use the appropriate context to interpret one part of the Bible to make it non-contradictory, then why can't we use the appropriate context with regard to the reading of Genesis?\n\n \n There are various ways to determine if one is truly \"seeing\" any scripture in the correct light. First, reading the entire scripture, before and after the particular passage usually reveals its context clearly. This method is true for all books, especially books of antiquity, and is something Mach failed to do. I'm sure he reads other material that way, but when it comes to the Bible, he's selective when trying to make a point - and he fails.\n \n We should take the Bible literally, but not always in a literal wooden sense. This means that, when Jesus said \"I am the door\", we don't invision Him as a true door with hinges and a door knob. It is a metaphor for a different meaning. In short, using common methods that you would use for any reading can be used for the Bible. I do see what your saying however. I can 'see' what I want to see and disregard what might actually be there. In fact, you can see metaphor in \"Dawkins' description of the Darwinian principles of evolution that are summerized as follows - (from Andrew J. Bradbury)\n \n 1. Organisms are constructed by groups of genes whose goal is to leave more copies of themselves. The hereditary material is basically 'selfish'. \n \n 2. The inherently selfish qualities of the hereditary material are reflected in the competitive interactions between organisms that result in survival of fitter variants, generated by the more successful genes. \n \n 3. Organisms are constantly trying to get better (fitter). In a mathematical/geometrical metaphor, they are always trying to climb up local peaks in a fitness landscape in order to do better than their competitors. However, this landscape keeps changing as evolution proceeds, so the struggle is endless. \n \n 4. Paradoxically, humans can develop altruistic qualities that contradict their inherently selfish nature, by means of education and other cultural efforts. \n \n Can you see these metaphors? Do they look familar?\n \n To compare - each number matches the one above. \n \n 1. Humanity is born in sin; we have a base inheritance. \n \n 2. Humanity is therefore condemned to a life of conflict and ... \n \n 3... Perpetual toil \n \n 4. But by faith and moral effort humanity can be saved from its fallen, selfish state \n \n So we see that the Darwinism described by Dawkins, whose exposition has been been very widely (but by no means universally) acclaimed by biologists, has its metaphorical roots in the main concept of the Bible, the story of the fall and redemption of humanity. What is he REALLY saying? In short, in terms of its underlying metaphors, Darwinism a la Dawkins looks suspiciously akin to fundamentalist Christianity minus God. We all worship something, and in the case of the evolutionist, it's often Darwin.",

(See Post 5 where I give a small list of various theories).\n\n \nReally, interesting, considering I start with my definition in the first post, and in the second post, clarify the position. Yet you ignore it,\n\n That's it exactly! You made a statement of what creation 'is'. And it isn't necessarily that one theory. You were caught in a wave of irrational anti-religious ranting that targeted all creationism, as if it is homogenous. You were caught out, and even when you 'clarified your post after, you ignored your own argument, and made a new one about God being irrational.\n \nas you ignore logic. I cannot force you to admit your claim is illogical, suffice to say, it has been proven to be so, accept the evidence, or not.\n\n If comforts you to live in a world of such false hopes. I know it can be rather confronting when ideals are tested and found lacking; yours is a classic case study. That you continually resort to the claim \"You're posts are irrational\", rather than debate is proof of this. As is your claim to believe in science; not apparently when it goes against your own beliefs... hence you make the strangest admixture of argument against science I've yet seen by any poster; including the weird \"Appeal to Authority\" (appealing to science to deal with science is in fact what you claim most other times religious people do not)\n \nYou do not have to accept the evidence, of course, since you do indeed accept claims based on no evidence.\n\n Yes, again you just repeat this. There's a whole study-case in paradigm shifts, right here; why people are so hard to budge. If you had evidence, you'd have actually presented it. So far your 'evidence' mainly consists of you stating and then re-stating my argument is illogical, added to this the misapplication of \"Appeal to authority\", and the ignoring of your own example given, where-by you admit that there is something both known about the unknowable, and that there is something unknowable.\n When I write this it is not to shatter your fragile faith in science, but to open your eyes to a bigger world. And that included a mass of evidence that doesn't agree with you. You might want to deal with it in a rational way; but so far you have not.\n \nWhat did I post in the first and second posts for anyone to re-visit?\n Creation: The belief that the universe (and of course everything in it) was created by some supernatural entity. \n I start with a definition.\n\n That definition is not of 'creation', but of some accounts of creation.\n You would have been better to state this version of creation as 'a' version of creation. You not only state that this 'is' creation, you go on to give a definition of what evolution 'is', too, and that is only one version.\n For the record, you said the following, not me!\n \nOriginally Posted by Montalban\n We can take your other definitions of creationism one at a time, thank you very much. I'd like to first focus on the one that involves your god, or any god, described as being unknowable (which you have said your god is). Will you \"allow\" us to focus on ONE thing? You see, if we have a list of 4 things, and we go through them one by one, we can maybe arrive at the end!!! Crazy thought isn't it! \n\n \nI then acknowledge there are other definitions that we can also tackle in turn.\n\n Only after it is pointed out that there are others. And then your next post #13 you drop you attempts at re-butting any version of creation to begin this long draw-out series of posts where you state my belief in God is illogical, based on your oft repeating of that statement.\n \nBut you claim this is the basis that my entire post is irrational? Are you lying, just didn't recall our discussion, or are you just not capable of identify rational vs irrational claims? You deserve no respect. \n\n Let's again look at what 'respect' is in regards to you.\n You claim my beliefs to be irrational; you base this on your claim to respect the findings of science; but this fails as you refuse to acknowledge science when it disagrees with you; thus you are as irrational as you think I am.\n Yours are claimed to be rational, based on science.\n You have yet to prove your case by science, and when I show science doesn't agree with you, you discard it. Thus effectively, your claim to me being irrational, is by your own definition, irrational. Science that agrees with unknowables, with fuzzy logic, with more than one 'scientific method', with exobiology as being science (rather than science fiction), with evolution being based on evidences constructed into a workable theory, your version of science being but one of many versions (not based on a philosophy of science), a whole raft of areas you just go on believing what you want to believe despite the evidence; faith! (which is according to you irrational, ergo, your beliefs are irrational).\n If you had any respect for science, or reasoned debate, you'd make use of reason and science. You don't. You actually reject the science of 'unknowables that I posted, simply because it doesn't agree with you. That shows no respect for even your own claims. You establish a test, that your own argument continually fails.\n Hypocrisy comes to mind. Zealotness also does. Your own wish to undermine evidenced debate is extraordinary, considering that this is one of the things you claim to cherish.\n So, in fact your own words are rather hollow. When you belittle religious people with your claims that we're irrational, you do so only to make a cheap point which on closer scrutiny not only can't you prove it, but you just repeat.\n Worse than that, perhaps, is that you just like to denigrate religion, with no real basis; other than an unsupported bias against it... recall several times I've pointed out that you don't have to agree with someone. But anti-religious bigotry can cause much irrational, highly emotive talk... as evidenced by Dawkins' claims re: 9/11. (which also, you've not apologised over for stating that my quote was a paraphrasing re-worked into an argument; a clearly defamatory remark to make!)\n If this has shaken your faith in your own faith, then I'm sorry that it sometimes seems hurtful. But, when you make a claim, and you can't back it up, and you ignore people who can, then it's rather sad.\n You seem quite at ease consigning all religious thought to irrationality, but you get in a huff when the spotlight is fixed upon you, especially as you can't make argument based on science.\n \nI'll keep an eye out for your refutation of basic logic or your acceptance of it. I hope you enjoyed your pizza as much as I enjoy your conclusion resulting in yet more false claims, and your staunch denial of logic.\n -Mach\n\n Yes I enjoyed my pizza. As to the rest of your comment; simply stating it's a false claim repeatedly, and believing this is a reasoned debate is illogical. You've still not addressed your own refutation of your belief that there's nothing unknowable; when you claim that a part of you is unknowable. As I say, you so oft contradict yourself. You too have begun making this claim too, but you don't back it up with examples. It's another of your hollow statements.\n \n Basically you create a 'test' for what is rational; that which can be tested by science. And your theories fail your own test. You make a claim that something not based on science; such as 'faith' is irrational. Not only have you not shown this, you've shown no respect for science, and make your own irrational statements (irrational, by your own definition). IF all of this seems ad hominem to you, then you might want to consider\n a) withdrawing your un-supported/spurious accusations against my beliefs\n b) come up with an argument that supports your claim; based on the test you believe my faith fails, but which your argument has yet to pass.",

   "Greetings Mach:\n \n \nTo support creation you must first tackle the concept of something \"outside\" the knowable universe. Because this is irrational, the entire concept of creation is irrational to \"believe\" in.  You can believe in it, but you must accept that the belief is not a rational belief. \n\n \n Firstly, we take the actual events of creation and the existence of God by faith - because we were not there to observe the events happening. Similarly, evolutionists must also take the supposed progression of life from simple to complex by faith, as we were not there to observe the events happening and they certainly cannot be repeated today. \n \n If someone gives you an eye witness account of an event that happened before your time and all the evidence that you have collected does not contradict that account, is it no logical and rational to believe that eye witness' account? In a similar way, we have the Word of our Creator who doesn't lie and who was there in the beginning. The actual physical evidence fits nicely with what we would expect if the Bible is right, e.g. fossils, mutations, the fact that there are billions of sea things burried in massive \"underwater graves\" all over the Earth - some while still eating or giving birth (i.e. had to be rapid). So if the evidence that we have collected does not contradict what His eye witness account says (i.e. Genesis) than, is it not logical and rational to believe it to be true? In fact, it would be illogical and irrational to not believe it!\n \n \nThe theory of evolution as it applies to life on earth:\n Essentially that the various living things on the earth are a product of purely physical/natural laws, which can be rationally explained.\n\n \n But which cannot be repeated nor observed - thus making a belief system about the past.\n \n \nThere is nothing inherently irrational about the theory of evolution being used to explain life in the physical unviverse, yet creation begins with an irrational premise, that we can \"know\" about the \"unknowable\". It can certainly be a false theory, however, you can rationally show that it is or is not (to the degree determined by your evidence).\n\n \n Actually, the whole basis for modern science depends on the assumption that the universe was made by a rational creator. Dr Stanley Jaki has documented how the scientific method was still-born in all cultures apart from the Judeo-Christian culture in Europe (Science and Creation (Edinburgh and London: Scottish Academic Press, 1974)). An orderly universe makes perfect sense if it was made by an orderly Creator. But if there is no creator, or if Zeus and his gang were in charge, why should there be any order at all? Loren Eiseley stated (Loren Eiseley: Darwin's Century: Evolution and the Men who Discovered It, Doubleday, Anchor, New York (1961):\n \n 'The philosophy of experimental science...began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith, not the knowledge, that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operation... It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science, which professionally has little to do with faith, owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted, and that science today is sustained by that assumption.'\n \n C.S. Lewis also pointed out that even our ability to reason would be called into question if atheistic evolution were true (God in the Dock (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1970) pp. 52-53):\n \n 'If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision, then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident, and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too. If so, then all our thought processes are mere accidents-the accidental by-product of the movement of atoms. And this holds for the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else's. But if their thoughts-i.e. of Materialism and Astronomy-are merely accidental by-products, why should we believe them to be true? I see no reason for believing that one accident should be able to give a correct account of all the other accidents.'\n \n Further more, on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it?\n \n \nIt is not a rational alternative to the theory of evolution, unless you can somehow show that you aren't relying on the unknowable.\n \n \n But we also don't know that evolution is true - it is a belief system about the past that requires faith for it to have any reason. Your first part is already false (proved above).\n \n \nKeep in mind two important points:\n 1. Reason does not imply truth, it's a method of seperating truth from what is false, and you can quite easily (and do every day), reason something to a false conclusion. \n 2. You can believe whatever you like, and it can certainly impact your life (faith), however it cannot be said that faith is based on rational belief, or takes part in reason, in any way, it is the opposite of reason.\n\n \n If information came into being by chance, how can we know that anything is true? How do you know what is false and what is \"true\"? If we are just products of chance, your brain is also a product of chance. Therefore, the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. You can't even be sure you can reason properly (using your definition) because you can't trust your own logic.\n \n As for the second part, no, you've got it backward, rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator. \n \n References:\n * The Creationist Basis for Modern Science.\n * The Lie: Evolution ~ Ken Ham.\n * Evolution: Fact or Fiction? ~ John Blanchard.",

Furthermore, since evolution relies on reason, faith cannot be applied to it. To attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction. I know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven, but that's the definition of faith!! It wouldn't be faith without it. As Montalban says in a contradiction of motives: His particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [reason]. Why then look for support from reason?\n \n \n\n If someone gives you an eye witness account of an event that happened before your time and all the evidence that you have collected does not contradict that account, is it no logical and rational to believe that eye witness' account?

This is no great feat, we can all make a reasonable mountain of claims based on a single irrational premise. You don't NEED reason, you have faith, it's the opposite of reason.\n \n \nActually, the whole basis for modern science depends on the assumption that the universe was made by a rational creator.

Whatever science was, it has become a body of knowledge, through application of reason.\n \n \nC.S. Lewis also pointed out that even our ability to reason would be called into question if atheistic evolution were true (God in the Dock (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1970) pp. 52-53):\n\n \n That's enough appeals to authority for one post.\n \n \n'If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision, then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident, and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too.

I see no reason for believing that one accident should be able to give a correct account of all the other accidents.'\n\n \n C.S.Lewis believes things on faith, yet we are to use his words, which he is not here to clarify, as evidence that my claim is false, when he obviously accepts the same illogical claim as premise? His use of the word accident can readily be replaced by \"the natural laws of the universe\", or other more descriptive terms, without the negative connotation that seems to scare believers. \"We're an accident? OMG, then we must right!\".\n \n \nFurther more, on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it?\n\n Why so many claims in opposition? I make a single claim, that can be refuted through logic, if it's fallacy. But the claim is correct.\n \n This new claim is an interesting one that I have seen others use. I'll tell you on what basis. Based on reason. To hold that nothing can be known for certain, is ultimately reduced to absurd unintelligble nonsense. I'll start a thread about this claim, it's a hot topic to be sure!\n \n \nBut we also don't know that evolution is true - it is a belief system about the past that requires faith for it to have any reason. Your first part is already false (proved above).\n\n \n No, faith and reason are mutually exclusive. Science is based on reason. Science cannot prove with certainty what exists and what does not. Only based on evidence, and the nature of the evidence, can science justify or not justify a belief. As Dzeron said, science includes belief in something with 0-100% certainty based on evidence. Faith is 0% or 100%, and requires no evidence.\n \n Where does one need faith, exactly, to make claims about evolution (hint: faith is not needed).\n \n \nIf information came into being by chance, how can we know that anything is true? How do you know what is false and what is \"true\"? If we are just products of chance, your brain is also a product of chance. Therefore, the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. You can't even be sure you can reason properly (using your definition) because you can't trust your own logic.\n\n \n Sounds like the same skeptic argument above. I don't know about you Nu Leader, but when I'm certain my mind exists. Are you not certain? You are actually required to be, to deny you exist would require existence, and that would be logically contradictory.\n \n \nAs for the second part, no, you've got it backward, rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator. \n \n \n I disagree, I need you to show me what part of reason is BASED on faith of a rational creator, based on evidence (includes things that are self-evident). Unless you want me to accept your claim on faith!!\n \n -Mach",

Mach, you've built your whole ideas about religion on a philosophy of objectivism. And when you claim to respect evidence, it's shown that you don't, because you claim no amount of evidence will convince you to change your own conceptions. Think about that for a moment. Lots of people disagree with you, including scientists, (whom you allegedly respect), and yet when they say something that contradicts you, you believe you are right, and everyone else is wrong. This also is the real reason you persist, because despite over-whelming evidence, you can't admit now, that you're wrong. The worse thing about this is the hypocrisy of condemning religious people for being irrational (of basing ideas on faith; devoid of evidence) and yet you show NO respect for evidence. No respect for science. Your condemnations of religion are based on a self-deceit.",

   "Hello Mach:\n \n \nYou start with \"existence of God\" as a truth. Any further reasoning is circular if it uses God as evidence. :( \n \n \n You are an atheist? If so, than you start with the assumption that there is no God as truth. Thus you have already ruled out the slightest possibility of there being a rational creator God who made the world in six days about six thousand years ago.\n \n Think about this, do you know what happened aboard the Titanic just before she went down into the sea? You know the events that happened, not because you were there, but because several eye witness accounts told of what happened. Similarly, we are also told about what happened at the beginning through the eye witness account of God who doesn't lie and who was there. It would be irrational not to believe what He says in Genesis. The Bible has been tested in many ways and has passed those tests, thus I find it rational to believe in a rational God.\n \n God is also not used as evidence for creation, although He made everything. A creationist might look at the amazingly complex brain, DNA system, and many other elements of design and state that they must need a Designer because we know that natural processes cannot account for their existence. If we have an all powerful and all knowing Designer who made everything, would you not expect to see many, many elements of design in His creation? We would, and that is exactly what we see.\n \n St. Thomas Aquinas? Forgive me, I've never heard of him.\n \n \nThe theory of evolution is based on evidence, the existence of god, is not..\n\n \n Of course it is based on the evidence, as is creation. They are both different interpretations about the same evidence that are ultimately determined by a person's underlying assumptions or belief systems. But we can reason that there must be God by way of observing the beauty and design all around us, the truth of the Bible, etc. All of these things only imply that a creator exists. We see a computer program, we know it needs a programmer. In a similar way, we see the highly complex DNA system, we must reason, coming to a similar conclusion that it needs a Designer.\n \n \nReason cannot be applied to it. Furthermore, since evolution relies on reason, faith cannot be applied to it.\n \n \n Actually, all evolutionists must have faith for their theory to be true. Can you prove that the big bang happened 15 billion years ago? No, all the evidence that we have in favour is the red shift of starlight and the background microwave radiation (which is all at the same temperature, give or take a few K). We all know how evolutionists interpret the evidence, but the evidence makes just as much more sense when interpreted through Dr Humphreys' new young earth relativistic cosmology model. This is outlined in his book \"Starlight and Time\" and is an amazing read. So the same evidence (e.g. redshift, CBM radiation) makes sense in both models (although CBM causes a little trouble in the big bang theory). \n \n But we have no human eye witness accounts of the big bang or even creation unfolding. Nor we can observe life coming from lifeless chemicals, nor we can observe life going from simple to complex - today we observe mutations and natural selection going in the opposite direction. Basically, no one was there to see the supposed evolution of all things. We have no eye witness accounts of any of these events, they certainly cannot be repeated or experimented upon today. This means that the evolutionist must take his belief in evolution by faith as he cannot prove that it happened here today in the present. \n \n \nTo attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction.\n \n \n I didn't. I claimed that science is based on the assumption that it is working in a rational and orderly universe; and a rational and orderly universe could only have been created by a rational and orderly Creator.\n \n \nI know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven, but that's the definition of faith!! It wouldn't be faith without it. Why then look for support from reason?\n\n \n Oh, I am just so bothered and annoyed that I can't prove my faith!!! Actually, I'm not really that bothered nor annoyed. I know that all the evidence points to creation, i.e. the creation interpretation makes more sense than the evolutionary interpretation. There is very good evidence to suggest the existence of God, for one, the fact that we are all still here is one. If there were no God, than this whole universe would cease to function. I believe the laws of nature and our sciences are man's attempt to describe the normal ways that God upholds His creation. When He acts differently, a miracle occurs. Of course, this is based on the belief that the Bible is true. Many other great scientists, including Newton and Galileo also seemed to believe that science and Christianity were compatible. \n \n Reason stems from the belief that the universe is orderly, rational and logical. By the dictionary, reason is the intellectual faculty by which conclusions are drawn from premises. Now, if we are accidents of pure chance (which evolution teaches) than the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. This is just to show that with evolution, you can't be sure of anything, because everything is just an accident. But with an orderly and rational Creator, you can be sure of things and be able to reason.\n \n \nAlmost, and this is why I start the entire debate from the begining.\n Your concept of God is the irrational claim, that leads, inevitably, to a string of reason based firmly on an irrational or illogical premise. This is no great feat, we can all make a reasonable mountain of claims based on a single irrational premise. You don't NEED reason, you have faith, it's the opposite of reason.\n\n \n Your concept of there being no God is an irrational claim, that leads, inevitably, to a string of reason based firmly on an irrational or illogical premise. I copied your words as it may be easiest to for you to understand the point I am trying to make. The use of God is a rational assumption. Your use of there not being a God is an assumption. By definition of reason, it is the intellectual faculaty by which conclusions are drawn from premises. On the existence of a rational Creator who made us in His image, our \"intellectual faculty\" would also be made in His image. Thus it is rational and logical. Hence, the conclusion that we come to from the premise that God exists is rational and logical. While evolution says we are accidents, and hence, our brain patterns that governs our logic and ability to reason must also be accidnets (i.e we would be irrational and illogical). After reasoning, the conclusions we came to would be most likely irrational and illogical.\n \n As you can see from the definition of reason, it depends on your starting faith or belief systems as to what conclusion you will come to. Another word for this faith is assumptions.\n \n \nThat's a completely different argument, order does not imply a creator.\n\n \n It definitely does not imply an accident. The dictionary defines an accident as an event without appear cause; mishap. While orderly is defined as being methodically arranged; tidy. For something to be orderly, or methodically arranged, intelligence must do it. For example, if you go into your room and just mindlessly throw everything around accidentally without planning where it will go, it will not create a nice clean room. No, it will create disorder. Accidents will never create order. Car crashes, for example, do not create order. Think about this, you have bits and pieces of car for over a hundred metres depending on the severity. I'ld hate to be involved in one like that! \n \n If you want your room to look orderly, you must carefully plan where you want to put all of your possessions, where they will look neat and tidy. Hence, intelligence creates order. Therefore, an orderly universe cannot come about by accident and thus requires intelligence, i.e. God.\n \n \nNo, faith and reason are mutually exclusive. Science is based on reason.\n \n \n As proved above by definition of reason above, it all depends on what premise or starting assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reason out. You are correct that faith does not neccessary require evidence. But there is usually always evidence to support the validity of a particular faith, in this case Christianity.\n \n \nWhere does one need faith, exactly, to make claims about evolution (hint: faith is not needed).\n\n \n The big bang, life from non-life, the progression of life from the simple to the complex, just to name a few. None of these can be proved (even on the balance of probabilities) to be true by operations science. All of these contradict scientific observations of the present. As a result, you must take them by purely blind faith.",

It is meant to be a summation of an argument style that has gone on for some weeks.\n \n When somebody makes a statement like Mach has: \"Your beliefs in creation have no rational basis\" this is insulting, and it is itself irrational, as there's more than one creation belief; so to sweep them all aside in one foul swoop is irrational. It is also insulting to the intelligence of those who believe in these ideas. Stating that such an attack is insulting because it is irrational; and Mach warns me that this is insulting him! \n \n When the basis for making this claim is itself based in scientism, and objectivism then these ideas need to be tested. When it is pointed out that the partitioner of these beliefs will not test them, then Mach claims that is insulting.\n \n When the practitioner of these beliefs tests everyone else's beliefs against science, but fails to put his own beliefs to the same test, that is illogical. When this is pointed out, Mach claims that this is insulting.\n \n When someone claims that religious people's beliefs are irrational because they are based only on faith; and devoid of evidence, but he provides none himself, other than a re-statement of his beliefs, then this is irrational. When this is pointed out, Mach claims that this is insulting.\n \n When evidence is cited in favour of a rational faith, it is ignored. Or, alternatively it is claimed to be an 'appeal to authority'.

When this is pointed out, Mach claims that this is insulting.\n \n When the fractioned of this philosophy claims to respect evidence from science, but then dismisses all that contradicts his own a priori beliefs, then this is irrational. When this is pointed out, Mach claims this is insulting.\n \n It is not meant to be an insult. But when one person enters this forum, allegedly to debate, but makes no effort to; and belittles everyone's religious views, based on a standard he won't face himself, then this needs to be pointed out.\n \n He makes claims by an adherence to objectivism that everything can be known to science. How has he shown this? Did he show this for the concept of 'love'? No.\n Does he believe therefore that nothing is unknowable? Yes, (although alternatively he has stated a part of him is unknowable). What is this based on? His opinion that it is so. He has recently quoted from a site which itself gives a definition for something he says can't be defined. Further digging at that same site reveals further troubles. How does he address this? By repeating the statement about his beliefs. Is pointing this out insulting? It is not meant to be.\n \n Yet he goes on attacking the intelligence of everyone who doesn't share the same philosophy of science he believes to be true, which he can't/won't prove to be true, by science. Which he can't/won't address argument from science that contradicts him.\n \n Not every scientist is so arrogant to claim that science can know everything that can be known.

All you have are the words of other believers.\n\n \n Actually, Milo brought up many good points in his reply to Mach - most of which you ignored. You would, if you read it, recognise the following statement from Milo's argument:\n \n The question then becomes, \"Has God made Himself known to us?\" This question can be answered by looking at the manuscript, archeological, statistical, and prophetic evidence contained in scripture - all of which can be examined scientifically. But of course, your worldview will dictate how you approach it. \n \n I have, for one, supplied it many times of accurate scientific, historical and prophetical verses in the Bible that have been proved by science. May I assume that you are an anti-God believer, i.e. believe in no God? If so, than you will just state something like \"just luck\", or \"they were smart enough to figure them out - just logic\" just to ignore the fact that there may be divine authorship of the Bible. However, if you are a genuine searcher for truth, you will most likely say, \"Yeah, that seems reasonable to me to believe that the Bible might have had from divine origin\". Futher research into topics like creation/evolution may further strengthen the claims of the Bible.\n \n \nCan't you just admit that you believe because you choose to regardless of evidence or the lack thereof.\n \n \n As has also been explained throughouly in other threads, both creationists and evolutionists have the same evidence. This scientific evidence makes perfect sense when interpreted through a creationary model and fits exactly what we would expect to se if the Bible was true, e.g. rapid coal formation, millions of fish buried in underwater \"graves\" rapidly (some while still giving birth and eating, many fish fossils still have fins and other delicate parts =< quickly covered by sediments and fossilized) and many geological features (such as Uluru) all point to a devestating global flood of Noah's day. Design in our world, such as the complex DNA system =< a designer.\n \n (Note:\" =<\" means \"implies\").\n \n Faith is still an important factor though. There is nothing wrong with faith, it took people to believe that one day space ships would be able to land on the Moon and travel to the other planets long before it could actually happen. I have faith that the car is going to get me where I have to go without breaking down. There are many such examples where people have faith that an event will/won't happen while they are doing/planning to do something. Similarly, you believe that there is a God and that when you die, if you've been faithful to Him, you will have eternal life with Him.\n \n \nEven showing some events depicted in the Bible really happened proves nothing about the Bible's authorship or the existence of any deity.\n \n \n What about prophecies made hundreds of years before an event actually happened? For instance, in Isaiah 52:11 through to the end of Isaiah 53 under the title \"The Suffering and Glory of the Servant\" we read about the prophecy of the \"Messiah\" and what will happen to Him. This prophecy was made some (I've forgotton the date exactly), I think 800 years before a God's Son, Jesus Christ even walked the Earth and suffered and died for our sin (transgressions).\n For example, But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; (Isaiah 53:5).",

Perhaps you two have different interpretations of \"unkowable\". Does montalban mean unknowable in the scientific sense, such as whether or not God exists or how did we got here? In these cases, we don't have all the evidence nor have we any observations about either or these events, therefore, their existence and validity cannot be known (i.e. unknowable). If this is in the context of which he made that statement, it is from faith that he knows about what cannot be proved by science, e.g. the existence of God.\n \n Other wise, IMHO, you may have a point. That's my two cents worth.\n \n \n \nI restate my claim, because you reject the claim.\n \n \n I find a similar thing is true with many other members of this forum - except that they do not reject my claim, they appear to ignore it and wish it wasn't there on their screen - when they for example state something like:\n * \"There is no evidence for creation [or the Flood]\".\n * \"There is more evidence for evolution than creation\".\n * \"Creation requires faith, but evolution does not\".\n \n I find myself continually having to state that we both have the same evidence it just depends of your starting faiths as to what conclusion (or interpretation) you will come up with as to the origin of that evidence. Quite frankly, I sometimes get sick and tired of people's ignorance of this simple to understand argument and general knowledge. They do not even mention it in any replies, yet they still go on posting statements similar to those above when it can be proved that they are false. I do not know how many times I have stated or will have to state it that evolution is just as \"scientific\" as creation. They are both belief systems about the past which try to explain how all the evidence of the present originated by different starting assumptions and starting faiths/belief systems.

   "Hi Mach:\n From a staight forward reading and using your definition of knowable it translates to:\n \"I know something of [or about] what cannot be known\".\n \n Which is, an appearent contradiction. Perhaps you two have different interpretations of \"unkowable\". Does montalban mean unknowable in the scientific sense, such as whether or not God exists or how did we got here? In these cases, we don't have all the evidence nor have we any observations about either or these events, therefore, their existence and validity cannot be known (i.e. unknowable). If this is in the context of which he made that statement, it is from faith that he knows about what cannot be proved by science, e.g. the existence of God.\n=======================================\n \n I have two observations on this:\n \n 1. I have consistently used the definition with every claim (or most). There is no chance of his accidentally missing the definition, or rather, no excuse for that. \n \n 2. Exactly! Faith is what allows you to know God. You're correct! And for you, that's a truth, based on faith.\n \n And I also agree that we have different methods of arriving at (different definitions of) \"truth\" for certain things. Some, as you do, accept certain things (with regards to your religion), on faith. The alternative is through \"reason\", which requires evidence. Some have faith in God but of course live most of their life utilizing reason. Some use reason exclusively. No big deal, I wish all such debates could be so easily agreed upon!!\n \n *shakes hand*\n \n well said.\n \n -Mach",

I have said this over, and over, and over. That's strawman.\n \n \nSo whilst he continues to insult the intelligence of religious people he makes statements such as those above. Depends which day you catch him on.

He was the Christ; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him, for he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.\"  - Josephus  (aka Joseph ben Matthias) The Antiquities of the Jews, Book 18, Chapter 3: the so called Testimonium Flavianum\n \n I'd encourage you to check out this website for a brief discussion of any alleged references to an historical Jesus by historians: http://www.jesusneverexisted.com/josephus-etal.html\n \n Peace,\n The Bootfitter",

Some how, a person like you who would never question the existence of, say, Alexander the Great, or Homer, can easily dismiss a historical figure like Jesus - it's ludicrous. With over 5,000 extant copies documenting His existence, your comments aren't even worth a response. The predictions of Jesus birth were written hundreds of years before it took place. We know this due to the obvious dated periods they were written in. How do you explain the prediction of where He was born? How do you explain the prophecies that predicted His death? Tell me, how did He \"arrange\" these things?\n \n \n Josephus and Pliny the Younger did what? Were eye-witnesses to events in the life of Jesus? Hmmm... Can you provide any references to that effect? (The generally agreed upon date of the crucifixion is in the early 30's A.D. I believe Josephus was not born until 37 A.D.)\n\n \n So, you prove my point. When studying the Bible, you need the historian to be living at the time of record. Why? Do you take the same approach with other books of antiquity or historical books of recent history. Does the renound historian H. Zinn need to follow your requirement of having lived during the Civil War? Do you discount much of history because the historians that wrote the passages did not live during that time? In the case of Josephus, he did live near that time, and was a contemporary of the Apostles. It'c conceivable he was able to interview at least some eyewitnesses to the events he wrote about.\n \n \nPerhaps you are referring to the Testimonium Flavianum or \"Golden Paragraph\" as it is commonly known. (See below.) This reference, as far as I'm aware, is the only alleged reference to the Gospel Jesus in all of the writings of Josephus. (If you know of others, please provide them.) \n\n \n How many more would you need to be convinced that Jesus actually existed? 3, 12, 1000? The point is, Josephus mentions Him, probably spoke with those who knew Him, and he could verify claims of those who had no reason to validate the stories of the Christians if their claims were not true. He most likely would have used the same methods all historians use to validate claims. \n \n \nI'd encourage you to check out this website for a brief discussion of any alleged references to an historical Jesus by historians: http://www.jesusneverexisted.com/josephus-etal.html\n \n Peace,\n The Bootfitter\n\n \n I suggest you get your information from more than just a few websites.

She also provides answers to your questions.\n \n You can certainly ignore my comments... and you can certainly ignore these books... that doesn't mean that they don't exist. Fact: The historicity of Jesus is debateable. (Proof of that is that we are currently having such a debate.) He may have actually existed on this earth as described in the Gospels. He may not have. It doesn't really matter to me, since I recognize that my beliefs cannot change the reality of history.\n \n \nSo, you prove my point.\n\n I'm sorry... what was your point? \n \nWhen studying the Bible, you need the historian to be living at the time of record. Why?\n\n Where did I suggest anything of the sort? I am attempting to discern what it is you were trying to communicate with this statement: \"It's documented that Jesus actually fulfilled hundreds of prophecies by eye witnesses to the events, and also objective historians like Josephus and Pliny the Younger, among others - not just by the Bible.\"\n \n Your wording here does not make it clear whether you are suggesting that Josephus and Pliny the Younger may have been contemporaries of Jesus and eye-witnesses to events of his life. Now I think I understand that this is not what you were attempting to communicate. But rather, you were attempting to communicate that \"objective historians like Josephus and Pliny the Younger [documented that Jesus actually fulfilled hundreds of prophecies].\" If I still do not understand you correctly, please clarify what you meant by your original statement in question. If I do understand you correctly, then please provide references that show objective historians document the fulfillment of prophecies by Jesus.\n \n \nIn the case of Josephus, he did live near that time, and was a contemporary of the Apostles. It'c conceivable he was able to interview at least some eyewitnesses to the events he wrote about.\n\n Certainly this is conceivable. It is also conceivable that Josephus knew nothing of Jesus and wrote nothing of Jesus because Jesus did not exist as a physical human being on this earth.\n \n \nHow many more would you need to be convinced that Jesus actually existed? 3, 12, 1000? The point is, Josephus mentions Him, probably spoke with those who knew Him, and he could verify claims of those who had no reason to validate the stories of the Christians if their claims were not true. He most likely would have used the same methods all historians use to validate claims.\n\n My point is that the fact that Josephus ever mentions Jesus is in question. It is not clear whether Josephus ever did mention Jesus in his works. \n \n \nI suggest you get your information from more than just a few websites. There are several good works on the life of Josephus. \n\n Thank you. That's actually good advice that I follow myself. Do you have any particular works that you would recommend? I have only read bits and pieces of his biographical history as found in books dealing with other topics.",

   "Ahh... but I have. The website to which I referred you actually had four alleged references to Jesus. Did you take the time to read those references? Do you realize that those four historical references are far from incontrovertible evidence? \n \n To save you the trouble of finding these references (and some of their critiques), I have provided some in the websites below. If nothing else, it is clear that there is not a consensus regarding the historicity of Jesus Christ.\n\n \n Of course not! If there were consensus, we wouldn't be talking about it. But, the same can be said of Darwin's theory. Should we throw it away because we don't have \"consensus\"? Why would you require consensus?\n \n \n \nI'm sorry... what's ludicrous? \"A person like [me] who would never question the existence of... Alexander the Great, or Homer...\" From where did you get that? We're not talking about Alex or Homie here... we're talking about Jesus.\n\n \n The point being, that you seem to find it easy to believe in these figures, but not in Jesus. The evidence for scripture is overwhelming:\n \n There are more than 24,000 partial and complete manuscript copies of the New Testament. They are very ancient copies, and availble for examination even today.\n \n There are also around 86,000 quotations from the early church figures as well as several thousand Lectionaries (church-service books containing Scripture quotations used in the early centuries of Christianity).\n The truth is that the New Testament has an overwhelming amount of evidence supporting its reliability\n \n \n \n \n \n The historicity of other figures have nothing to do with the historicity of Jesus Christ of the Gospels.\n\n \n Maybe, but you skirt the issue. My point was that you can't see that you take for granted other works of antiquity as being valid and true, yet dismiss the Bible, which has greater physical evidence supporting it than the other books mentioned. You let your \"faith\" cloud your reasoning. You can't, or worse won't, see the evidence in front of you.\n \n Consider this quote from Dr. Norman Geisler:\n \n \"No other book is even a close second to the Bible on either the number or early dating of the copies. The average secular work from antiquity survives on only a handful of manuscripts; the New Testament boasts thousands.\n \n The average gap between the original composition and the earliest copy is over 1,000 years for other books.\n The New Testament, however, has a fragment within one generation from its original composition, whole books within about 100 years from the time of the autograph [original manuscript], most of the New Testament in less than 200 years, and the entire New Testament within 250 years from the date of its completion.\n The degree of accuracy of the copies is greater for the New Testament than for other books that can be compared. Most books do not survive with enough manuscripts that make comparison possible.\n From this documentary evidence, then, it is clear that the New Testament writings are superior to comparable ancient writings. \"The records for the New Testament are vastly more abundant, clearly more ancient, and considerably more accurate in their text.\"\n \n \n Regardless, I have made no claims one way or the other about this historicity of either of those figures. You have no way of knowing whether I accept them as historical or not.\n\n \n You're right, do you accept them as historical?\n \n \n \nYou still haven't provided any documentation to support your claim: \"...such as the predicted birth of Jesus hundreds of years before it happend. This event has been documented outside of the Bible.\" Regardless of whether you accept the possibility of an alternative explanation, you have not provided anything to back your claim.\n\n \n I didn't say the predictions were outside of the Bible. If there were any, the Bible wouldn't be so unique, now would it? However the fact that Jesus was born is documented elsewhere. As for the predictive statements in scripture of the birth of Jesus -\n \n \"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be ruler in Israel, whose going forth have been from of old from everlasting.\" (Micah 5:2).\n \n Other passages in the Old Testament:\n \n 1. Micah 5:2: Micah spoke to the southern kingdom during the latter part of the 8th century. In 5:2 he prophesizes that out of Bethlehem is to come a ruler who will rule in Israel, whose origin is from everlasting. \n \n 2. Isaiah contains several references to a Davidic king who will appear in the future, dating from the 8th century: \n \n a. Isa 9:1-7: Isaiah speaks of a child born (possibly Immanuel in 7:14) who would be given all authority and will establish a reign of peace; this figure is Davidic, as 9:7 makes clear: \"the throne of David.\" \n \n b. Isa 11 Isaiah speaks about a shoot from the stump of Jesse and a branch growing from its root (Jesse is David's father). This figure, in addition to being a Davidic king, will have the spirit of the Lord upon him (11:2), will judge with righteousness--including the destruction of the wicked (11:3- 5)-and will be a sign to the nations. He will reign in a time of unprecedented peace (11:6-9). (Isa 4:2 speaks of a branch of the Lord, who seems to be the same figure in 11.) \n \n c. Isa 32:1-8: Isaiah speaks of a king who will reign in righteousness; although no reference is made to the Davidic nature of this king, he probably is seen as identical to the figure in Isa 9 and 11. \n \n 3. Jeremiah received his call to be a prophet in the latter 7th century and continued after the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BCE. The prophet makes references to a descendent of David who would rule over Israel in the eschaton: \n \n a. Jer 23:5-7: God promises to raise up a \"righteous branch\" for David who who will execute justice and righteousness in the land; in his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. \n \n b. Jer 33:14-22 Jeremiah speaks about the raising up for David of a righteous branch in fufilment of the promise given to David; in those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will dwell in safety. \n \n 4. Ezekiel was taken captive by the Baylonians before the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE, and prophesied from Babylonia before and after the destruction. He prophesized the coming of an eschatological Davidic king: \n \n a. Ezek 34:23: In this passage the prophet says in the name of God that \"my servant David\" will be a shepherd over \"my flock\" and be a prince. \n \n b. Ezek 37:23-24: Ezekiel says in the name of God that \"my servant David\" will be king over a restored Israel; God promises that he will gather Israel, his sheep, and place David, His servant, over them as their shepherd. \n \n 5. Zech 9:9-10: Zechariah gives the promise of a king, a triumphant and victorious king, but a king humble riding on a donkey; this king will rule over the nations. (Nothing in the context, however, requires that this figure be identified with Zerubbabel.) \n \n There are also two passages from the Torah that seem to speak about a future ruler and are interpreted as referring to the Messiah in the second-Temple period. \n \n 1. Gen 49:10: Jacob prophecies that \"The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the staff from between his feet until \"Shiloh\" comes.\" \n \n 2. Num 24:17-19: Balaam, son of Beor, prophecies to Balak, king of Moab, \"A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will arise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of all the sons of Sheth. Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong. A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city.\" \n \n Now, it's true that interpretation is required, but no more or less than for scientific interpretation. Try and intrepret high level quantum physics if you're a non educated layman in the field. This person would have to depend on others to at least help him along. Did you \"know\" mathematics from birth, or was it taught to you? Did you rely on interpretation from your teachers? What about science and the scentific method? Did you come up with it yourself, or did you rely on the knowledge of others to impart the meaning to you? If so, why didn't your resist their teaching since it required their accurate knowledge and experience be given to you? I'm not suggesting you depend fully on others, but you might need a little help. You need not depend on Christian or \"religous\" zealots to show you the way. There are plenty of scholars out there that deal strictly with manuscript interpretation, and are secular historians.",

Then we have documents that were written several years (or even a century or two) AFTER the alleged birth of Jesus that claim the birth of Jesus several years earlier fulfilled the prophesies from the documents written several hundred years prior.\n --< Let's ask these questions... Are there other possible explanations for the alleged prophesies? Yes. Is it conceivable that even though a story was written about the birth of Jesus, that story did not (or was not intended to) represent actual events in the history of earth? Yes, this is conceivable. Is it conceivable that the documents written AFTER the alleged birth of Jesus simply used the earlier documents to construct the story of Jesus? Yes, this is conceivable. \n \n My point here is that the 'prophesy' explanation does not suffice, in that it does not account for all possibilities.\n \n 2) We have alleged 'eyewitness accounts.' From whom? Who were these eye-witnesses? And where are their eye-witness testimonies recorded? When was the earliest Gospel written? The earliest reasonable dates put it AT LEAST between 50-70 A.D. Were the authors of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John present for the birth of Jesus? Who were the eye-witnesses? Who was the eye-witness at Gethsemane when everyone but Jesus fell asleep? Who was there to record his words? Isn't it in the least bit curious how much this story resembles the literary work of a theatrical performance? Besides, eye-witness testimony is one of the least reliable forms of evidence available to us -- as it is related through the perceptions of the individual who perceived said events.\n \n 3) Statistical evidence? To what statistical evidence are you referring? Please share.\n \n \n MILO: \"The point being, that you seem to find it easy to believe in these figures, but not in Jesus... You're right, do you accept them as historical?\"\n THEBOOTFITTER: \"I have no opinion other than this: If they are historical, then they are historical. If they are not historical, then they are not historical. I have not investigated the historicity of either figure, and have no knowledge of any evidence to suggest either conclusion accurately represents reality. Neither do I have any interest in investigating the historicity of these two figures. Regardless... my opinions and the historicity of these two figures have nothing to do with the historicity of Jesus.\"\n MILO: \"If you have no interest, then you have no basis to determine truth, since you fail to consider all posibilities. This is your choice.\"\n \n --<I'm sorry... what? If we wish to explore the historicity of Alex the Great, we can certainly do so. I have no desire at this time to do so. He may be historical. He may not be. The historicity of Alex has nothing to do with the historicity of Jesus. There is absolutely no correlation. Alex may or may not be historical. Jesus may or may not be historical. If Alex is historical, does that imply greater probability that Jesus is historical? Nope. They each stand alone.\n \n \n MILO: \"My point was that you can't see that you take for granted other works of antiquity as being valid and true, yet dismiss the Bible, which has greater physical evidence supporting it than the other books mentioned. You let your \"faith\" cloud your reasoning. You can't, or worse won't, see the evidence in front of you.\"\n THEBOOTFITTER: \"But I don't take it for granted that other works of antiquity are valid and true. You are fabricating this out of nothingness.\"\n MILO: \"Fine, then I'll assume you didn't take for granted that Darwin's works are true or accurate either. Unless of course you're saying that you only considered examining and considering as true, certain works that your worldview agreed with before hand - again, your choice.\"\n \n --<You are really confusing me now. What does Darwin have to do with anything that we are discussing? I have not idea where you are coming from, nor where you are going, but your assumption is accurate that I do not take for granted that Darwin's works are true or accurate.\n \n To re-focus here -- my first post addressing this discussion, I believe, was #127. That was in direct response to your most recent post prior to #127.\n \n \n MILO: \"The evidence for scripture is overwhelming: There are more than 24,000 ... copies of the... [NT]... There are also around 86,000 quotations from the early church figures as well as several thousand Lectionaries...\"\n THEBOOTFITTER: \"The number of copies of the NT are not in question. Neither is the number of quotations from early church figures. To deny the existence of the NT is ludicrous... I have a copy beside my bed. Obviously it exists. The existence of the NT is not an argument for the historicity of Jesus. Consider that over 37 million copies of Harry Potter books have been sold. Is this evidence that Harry Potter is historical?\"\n MILO: \"I never said the existence of the NT was in question, but the credibility of it is, even if implicitly. As such, it's worth noting that the number of copies have been examined. They far outweigh the number of other works considered to be accurate and reliable, [emphasis mine] and they can be examined for errors and other problems. They have in fact been examined in this way, and show their depenability in continuity among the many copies available, which show reliable tranmission of the documents and that they can be trusted.\"\n \n --<I guess I missed your intent, then, in pointing out the number of copies in the first place. Even if there were perfect agreement from one copy to the next (which is not the case), it would only be evidence that there is perfect agreement from one copy to the next. This would not provide any evidence that each of the perfect copies that exist accurately reflect historical events.\n \n Again, consider Harry Potter. If 5 million identical copies of Harry Potter books are uncovered 5,000 years from now, will that be evidence that Harry Potter is an actual historical figure? No, of course not. It is just is evidence that there were at least 5 million identical copies of a book that was written about a character named Harry Potter.\n \n \n THEBOOTFITTER: How about this? --< The truth is that the NT has an overwhelming amount of evidence to support its existence. To confirm its reliability as an accurate historical record, we need to look at how well it coincides with other, independent sources of historical record.\n MILO: Agreed. That would be one valid way to determine the veracity of Scripture, and it's been done.\n \n --<It's been done. Okay. Let's start with a few items for which I am not aware of any corresponding independent historical records with which we can verify the claims of the NT:\n o The slaughter of the innocents.\n o The census around the time of the birth of Jesus.\n o Jesus tipping over tables in the Jerusalem temple.\n o The earthquake that followed the death of Jesus.\n o The individuals that rose from their graves after Jesus was resurrected.\n \n Can you refer me to independent historical documentation of any of these events?\n \n \n MILO: I didn't say the predictions were outside of the Bible. If there were any, the Bible wouldn't be so unique, now would it? However the fact that Jesus was born is documented elsewhere. [emphasis mine] --\n THEBOOTFITTER: Then please point out where this fact is documented.\n MILO: I'm not sure what you mean here.\n \n --<If you are still unsure what I mean... allow me to clarify:\n Please provide evidence for your claim that \"the fact that Jesus was born is documented elsewhere.\" Where is this fact documented? I have searched, and I have not found any such documentation. The authors of books that I have read have searched far more extensively than I have, and yet no one has shown any such documentation. If you are not aware, there is much debate as to when Jesus was allegedly born -- some people claim as far back as 100 years or more prior to the commonly accepted timeframe. If the actual birth of Jesus is documented elsewhere -- then why the debate?\n \n \n MILO: As for the predictive statements in scripture of the birth of Jesus...\n THEBOOTFITTER: Frankly, I am not interested in discussing the alleged prophesies of the OT that predict the life of Jesus. I do not doubt that many passage in the OT can be interpreted to be a prophecy that is fulfilled by Jesus. Besides the fact that they require interpretation to 'fit' the story of Jesus, even a million prophesies fulfilled in the story of Jesus would not be evidence for anything other than that a story of a man was written down, and the contents of the story show the links to the OT and how this man fulfilled many prophecies. It does nothing to suggest that the man about whom the story was written was historical.\n MILO: To believe this way is your prerogative. However, I would suggest that it's irrational, and most likely not the way that you address other forms of investigation. To say you're not interested proves my point. What you're really saying is that you're not interested in finding out what the truth is, but rather only interested in looking at that which supports your established view, and then advocating it. I understand, and it's a shame that someone who claims to seek truth through science, is only interested in considering that which agrees with him Ipso Facto.\n \n --<I'm sorry... what? To believe what way is my prerogative? Have I stated how or what I believe? No. You have no idea what I believe. What does my 'established view' have to do anything? Have I claimed to 'seek truth through science'? I don't believe so. If I have, please point out the specific quotation. Otherwise, any such thoughts are fabricated by you. \n \n Allow me to re-focus my main points for you:\n \n 1) You appear to have claimed in post #126 that the birth of Jesus was documented outside the Bible. I asked you in multiple posts to provide evidence to support your claim. I'm still waiting.\n \n 2) You claim in post #126 that \"If just 8 of these claims came true as predicted with one man fulfilling them to a tee, as documented by the Bible and objective history (Stoner, Science Speaks), the odds would be 1 in 10 to the 17th.\" Okay. So, we have a statistical statement for which we do not have the assumptions that were used in calculating the conclusion. And regardless... your statement is conditional. It begins with 'If.' The statement itself does nothing to establish that eight of those OT prophesies DID come true.\n \n 3) You appear to claim in post #126 that \"objective historians like Josephus and Pliny the Younger, among others\" documented that Jesus actually fulfilled hundreds of prophecies. You have not provided any evidence. I'm still waiting.",

   "By definition, faith requires no evidence. You are welcome to use experience or objective evidence that exists to support your faith. But faith, by definition, requires no evidence.\n Webster.com Main Entry: 1faith \n 1 ...\n 2 ...b (1) : firm belief in something for which there is no proof [emphasis mine] (2) : complete trust...\n\n \n Evidence is not proof. Evidence may lead one to a conclusion even without the thing in question being proven. Proof requires a rigorus standard that is supported by the evidence, but again, evidence is not proof. Therefore, faith is and should be supported by the evidence, but by it's very definition, it will never by \"proven\".\n \n \nLet's examine this evidence...\n 1) We have documents that were written centuries before the alleged birth of Jesus that contain certain passages that can be interpreted to be predicting the birth of Jesus. Then we have documents that were written several years (or even a century or two) AFTER the alleged birth of Jesus that claim the birth of Jesus several years earlier fulfilled the prophesies from the documents written several hundred years prior.\n --< Let's ask these questions...

Is it conceivable that the documents written AFTER the alleged birth of Jesus simply used the earlier documents to construct the story of Jesus? Yes, this is conceivable. \n\n \n All these things are conceivable, but the real question is, are they reasonable? This is where we have the problem. It's conceivable that one could put a gun to one's head fully armed, pull the trigger and survive. But is it reasonable to expect that would be the case? No. Likewise, we need to examine the evidence that supports or does not support the information presented in Scripture. I contend the evidence does support the Bible's assertions.\n \n \nMy point here is that the 'prophesy' explanation does not suffice, in that it does not account for all possibilities.\n\n \n Neither does Darwinism. It doesn't account for the possibility that there is a creator God. However, again you miss the point. If one writes a suicide note stating that he is going to kill himself by standing on a train track, and then is seen standing on that track as a train barrels down on him, and he's hit by that train and splattered all over the track, do we need to consider the possibility that he was killed by an airplane, or a bolt of lightning? No, if the evidence supports the conclusion that the person was killed by the train, other explanations need not be examined. So, the question is not should we examine all other possibilites, but that we need to determine the veracity of the evidence we do have.\n \n \n2) We have alleged 'eyewitness accounts.' From whom? Who were these eye-witnesses? And where are their eye-witness testimonies recorded? When was the earliest Gospel written? The earliest reasonable dates put it AT LEAST between 50-70 A.D. Were the authors of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John present for the birth of Jesus? Who were the eye-witnesses? Who was the eye-witness at Gethsemane when everyone but Jesus fell asleep? Who was there to record his words? Isn't it in the least bit curious how much this story resembles the literary work of a theatrical performance? Besides, eye-witness testimony is one of the least reliable forms of evidence available to us -- as it is related through the perceptions of the individual who perceived said events.\n\n \n The eyewitness accounts were recorded by the authors of the New Testament. They started to be copied less than 30 years after the event, which is remarkable since other works of antiquity cannot claim such a thing so close to the original writings, most being copied many years after the original documents were created.\n \n \n \n3) Statistical evidence? To what statistical evidence are you referring? Please share.\n\n \n I have - see my prior posts regarding the statistical probability of one man fulfilling even 8 prophecies of the Bible. Of course, you'd need to come to the conclusion that Jesus existed first, and that He carried out the deeds the Bible claims, but you'd need to examine the evidence for that elsewhere.\n \n \n \n--<I'm sorry... what? If we wish to explore the historicity of Alex the Great, we can certainly do so. I have no desire at this time to do so. He may be historical. He may not be. The historicity of Alex has nothing to do with the historicity of Jesus. There is absolutely no correlation. Alex may or may not be historical. Jesus may or may not be historical. If Alex is historical, does that imply greater probability that Jesus is historical? Nope. They each stand alone.\n\n \n There is correlation when we are talking about the reliability of documented history, which is the context I commented on. You make an unrelated comment. It's not the question of each being historical or not, but it's a question on how the receiver of the information either believes it or not. When it comes to works on Alexander, one usually takes them for granted as being true. I have never heard of anyone questioning the works written on \"Alex\" as the do with the Bible. The same standard used for literary criticism of other works is not the same as it is for the Bible. Since the Bible is a religious book, many scholars take the position that it is biased and cannot be trusted unless we have corroborating evidence from extra-Biblical sources. In other words, the Bible is guilty until proven innocent. Not so for other books of antiquity.\n \n \n--<You are really confusing me now. What does Darwin have to do with anything that we are discussing? I have not idea where you are coming from, nor where you are going, but your assumption is accurate that I do not take for granted that Darwin's works are true or accurate.\n\n \n Good. That's a start.\n \n \n \nTo re-focus here -- my first post addressing this discussion, I believe, was #127. That was in direct response to your most recent post prior to #127.\n\n \n \nMILO: \"The evidence for scripture is overwhelming: There are more than 24,000 ... copies of the... [NT]...

This would not provide any evidence that each of the perfect copies that exist accurately reflect historical events.\n\n \n You miss my intent? If you can't see the relivance of it, I'm shocked. The point is that the more copies we have of a document, the more the transmission of accurate information can be verified. If I have jus a couple of copies of a document written long ago, it can be argued that there may have been errors in transmisson. In the case of the Bible, the oldest copies we had were verified by copies that were found and dated to be around 2000 years older than the oldest copies we had at that time. There was virtually no difference in the sets, except for a verb there or some grammatical issues, but the main ideas were there. If that's not evidence for supernatural influence, then what is. Where can you show such accuracy in any other documents of history? The point is that there is continuity of transmission. Now, that said, before the discovery of the older scrolls, critics tried to use error in transmission as a case against the Bible. Now you don't hear that argument anymore.\n \n \nAgain, consider Harry Potter. If 5 million identical copies of Harry Potter books are uncovered 5,000 years from now, will that be evidence that Harry Potter is an actual historical figure? No, of course not. It is just is evidence that there were at least 5 million identical copies of a book that was written about a character named Harry Potter.\n\n \n Not the same thing. First, I'm not saying that the copies prove the historicity of Jesus, other than to say that there are many copies that speak of His life and ministry, and that these copies have been transmitted accurately. Why? It is quite a different thing to automate copies of a book for profit, all printed within a short period of time, than to write about a figure that did not exist, for no profit, with no real gain to be had, through very difficult circumstances, which might have included death for the writer(s), and in fact did cause death to most of the apostles. Why would they suffer death for a liar? Why would they willingly subject themselves to persecution and hardship for a person that never existed? It's not reasonable. Also, consider that the Bible is a collection of 66 different books, written over a period of about 1500 years, by 40 different authors, each from different backgrounds, written in three different languages over three differnt continents, and yet it has a unified message as if written by one source. How do you explain this? Especially when it was done with no fax machines, computers, telephones, or any other modern convenience?\n \n THEBOOTFITTER: How about this? --< The truth is that the NT has an overwhelming amount of evidence to support its existence.

Let's start with a few items for which I am not aware of any corresponding independent historical records with which we can verify the claims of the NT:\n o The slaughter of the innocents.\n\n \n What about it?\n \n \no The census around the time of the birth of Jesus.\n\n \n Census began under Augustus approximately every 14 years: 23-22 B.C., 9-8 B.C., 6 A.D. There is evidence of enrollment in 11-8 B.C. in Egyptian papyri. \n Problem: Historian Josephus puts Quirinius as governor in Syria at 6 A.D. Solution: Recent inscription confirms that Quirinius served as governor in 7 B. C. (in extraordinary, military capacity). \n Problem: Herod's kingdom was not part of the Roman Empire at the time, so there would not have been a census. Solution: it was a client kingdom. Augustus treated Herod as subject (Josephus). Parallel-a census took place in the client kingdom of Antiochus in eastern Asia Minor under Tiberius. \n Enrollment in hometown? Confirmed by edict of Vibius Maximus, Roman prefect of Egypt, in 104 A.D. \"...it is necessary for all who are for any cause whatsoever way from their administrative divisions to return home to comply with the customary ordinance of enrollment.\" \n \n \no Jesus tipping over tables in the Jerusalem temple.\n\n \n Not sure what you're getting at here.\n \n \n \no The earthquake that followed the death of Jesus.\n\n \n Still not sure what your getting at. Do you have a question?\n \n \no The individuals that rose from their graves after Jesus was resurrected.\n\n \n Oh, I see. You feel that if one can't provide evidence on every event and statement provided in the Bible, that somehow that shows inconsistency or fault in the scripture? I suggest you instead look at the points that have been scoffed at by \"scholars\" in the past, and then borne out in the end. This would include:\n \n The New Testament mentions specific individuals, places, and various official titles of local authorities, confirmed by recent archeology. Luke sites exact titles of officials. (Titles varied from city to city so they are easily checked for accuracy.) Lysanias the Tetrarch in Abilene (Luke 3:1)-verified by inscription dated 14-29 A.D. Erastus, city treasurer of Corinth (Romans 16:23)-verified by pavement inscription. Gallio-proconsul of Achaia (Greece) in A.D. 51 (Acts 18:12). Politarchs (\"city ruler\") in Thessalonica (Acts 17:6). Chief Man of the Island on Malta (Acts 28:7). Stone Pavement at Pilate's headquarters (John 19:13)-discovered recently. Pool at Bethesda- discovered in 1888. Many examples of silver shrines to Artemis found (Acts 19:28). Inscription confirms the title of the city as \"Temple Warden of Artemis\". Account of Paul's sea voyage in Acts is \"one of the most instructive documents for the knowledge of ancient seamanship.\" \n \n Also......\n \n Ebla tablets-discovered in 1970s in Northern Syria. Documents written on clay tablets from around 2300 B.C. demonstrate that personal and place names in the Patriarchal accounts are genuine. In use in Ebla was the name \"Canaan,\" a name critics once said was not used at that time and was used incorrectly in the early chapters of the Bible. The tablets refer to all five \"cities of the plain\" mentioned in Genesis 14, previously assumed to have been mere legends. \n Greater proportion of Egyptian words in the Pentateuch (first five books) than in rest of the Old Testament. Accurate Egyptian names: Potiphar (Gen.39), Zaphenath-Paneah (Joseph's Egyptian name, Gen. 41:45), Asenath (Gen.41:45), On (Gen. 41:45), Rameses (Gen. 47:11), Oithom (Exodus 1:11). \n Finds in Egypt are consistent with the time, place, and other details of biblical accounts of the Israelites in Egypt. These include housing and tombs that could have been of the Israelites, as well as a villa and tomb that could have been Joseph's. \n Confounding earlier skeptics, but confirming the Bible, an important discovery was made in Egypt in 1896. A tablet-the Merneptah Stela-was found that mentions Israel. (Merneptah was the pharaoh that ruled Egypt in 1212-1202 B.C.) The context of the stela indicates that Israel was a significant entity in the late 13th century B.C. \n The Hittites were once thought to be a biblical legend, until their capital and records were discovered in Turkey. \n Crucial find in Nuzi (northeastern Iraq), an entire cache of Hittite legal documents from 1400 B.C. Confirms many details of Genesis, Deuteronomy, such as: (a) siring of legitimate children through handmaidens, (b) oral deathbed will as binding, (c) the power to sell one's birthright for relatively trivial property (Jacob & Esau), (d) need for family idols, such as Rachel stole from Laban, to secure inheritance, (e) form of the covenant in Deuteronomy exactly matches the form of suzerainty treaties between Hittite emperors and vassal kings. \n Walls of Jericho-discovery in 1930s by John Garstang. The walls fell suddenly, and outwardly (unique), so Israelites could clamber over the ruins into the city (Joshua 6:20). \n In 1986, scholars identified an ancient seal belonging to Baruch, son of Neriah, a scribe who recorded the prophecies of Jeremiah (Jer. 45:11). \n In 1990, Harvard researchers unearthed a silver-plated bronze calf figurine reminiscent of the huge golden calf mentioned in the book of Exodus. \n In 1993, archaeologists uncovered a 9th century B.C. inscription at Tel Dan. The words carved into a chunk of basalt refer to the \"House of David\" and the \"King of Israel.\" And the Bible's version of Israelite history after the reign of David's son, Solomon, is believed to be based on historical fact because it is corroborated by independent account of Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions. \n It was once claimed there was no Assyrian king named Sargon as recorded in Isaiah 20:1, because this name was not known in any other record. Then, Sargon's palace was discovered in Iraq. The very event mentioned in Isaiah 20, his capture of Ashdod, was recorded in the palace walls! Even more, fragments of a stela (a poetic eulogy) memorializing the victory were found at Ashdod itself. \n Another king who was in doubt was Belshazzar, king of Babylon, named in Daniel 5. The last king of Babylon was Nabonidus according to recorded history. Tablet was found showing that Belshazzar was Nabonidus' son. \n The ruins of Sodom and Gomorrah have been discovered southeast of the Dead Sea. Evidence at the site seems consistent with the biblical account: \"Then the Lord rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah-from the Lord out of the heavens.\" The destruction debris was about 3 feet thick and buildings were burned from fires that started on the rooftops. Geologist Frederick Clapp theorizes that that pressure from an earthquake could have spewed out sulfur-laden bitumen (similar to asphalt) known to be in the area through the fault line upon which the cities rest. The dense smoke reported by Abraham is consistent with a fire from such material, which could have ignited by a spark or ground fire. \n \n All of which you can verify yourself by referencing the many written works\n \n I can't go on answering you, but it looks like you have your plate full with what I've given you above. It's up to you to do the research. I can say however that your arguments are 1: arbitrary, and 2: inconsistent. My position is not. The Bible is internally consistent. For instance, the belief in life after death is internally consistent with the rest of the Bible. In contrast, the non-biblical view is inconsistent. It states that we came from nowhere and are going nowhere, but life is full of meaning in between. Only the Biblical worldview is consistent.\n \n The statement \"there are no moral absolutes\" contains two mistakes:\n \n 1: The declaration itself is an absolute statment - so it contradicts itself.\n 2: A person can't live his life without moral absolutes. - e.g., fairness vs. unfairness, kindness vs. hatred.\n \n So, ponder these things. And I suggest you stop running around in circles. You're going to make yourself sick.",

Here is a brief snapshot of one opinion that differs from yours: http://pages.ca.inter.net/~oblio/CTVExcerptsOne.htm#One\n \n \nI have - see my prior posts regarding the statistical probability of one man fulfilling even 8 prophecies of the Bible. Of course, you'd need to come to the conclusion that Jesus existed first, and that He carried out the deeds the Bible claims, but you'd need to examine the evidence for that elsewhere. \n\n As you suggest, you are starting with a premise that is questionable. A conclusion drawn from a questionable premise cannot be without question itself.\n \n \nIt's not the question of each being historical or not, but it's a question on how the receiver of the information either believes it or not.\n\n I think you are suggesting here that essentially, accepting the Bible as historical is a matter of faith. If not, please clarify.\n \n \nThe same standard used for literary criticism of other works is not the same as it is for the Bible. Since the Bible is a religious book, many scholars take the position that it is biased and cannot be trusted unless we have corroborating evidence from extra-Biblical sources. In other words, the Bible is guilty until proven innocent. Not so for other books of antiquity. \n\n Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The Bible makes several extraordinary claims. \n \n \nYou miss my intent? If you can't see the relivance of it, I'm shocked. The point is that the more copies we have of a document, the more the transmission of accurate information can be verified... The point is that there is continuity of transmission. Now, that said, before the discovery of the older scrolls, critics tried to use error in transmission as a case against the Bible. Now you don't hear that argument anymore. \n\n I am not here to dispute the accuracy of transmission from copy to copy to copy. I stated quite clearly in my most recent post that the accuracy of transmission has nothing to do with whether or not the content that is being transmitted is an accurate description of historical events.\n \n \n ...than to write about a figure that did not exist, for no profit, with no real gain to be had, through very difficult circumstances, which might have included death for the writer(s), and in fact did cause death to most of the apostles. Why would they suffer death for a liar? Why would they willingly subject themselves to persecution and hardship for a person that never existed? It's not reasonable. \n\n I'm not even aware that there is independent historical evidence to suggest that the apostles were historical characters. Regardless... There are certainly other examples of people who have died for beliefs that have no apparent basis in reality. Remember Waco, TX?\n \n \nAlso, consider that the Bible is a collection of 66 different books, written over a period of about 1500 years, by 40 different authors, each from different backgrounds, written in three different languages over three differnt continents, and yet it has a unified message as if written by one source. How do you explain this? Especially when it was done with no fax machines, computers, telephones, or any other modern convenience? \n\n Unified message? Hoo-boy... Let's save this one for another thread... perhaps in the Biblical Contradictions forum. Suffice it to say that your claim that the Bible has a \"unified message as if written by one source\" is debateable.\n \n \n--<What about it? [referring to the slaughter of the innocents]\n --<Not sure what you're getting at here. [referring to Jesus' episode in the temple when he knocked over the tables] \n --<Still not sure what your getting at. Do you have a question? [referring to the earthquake recorded in scripture that allegedly happened after Jesus died on the cross]\n\n Ummm... I asked you to provide independent historical evidence to show that the Bible story accurately portrays history on earth. It appears you missed it... Here it is again (including the background that led to it) --<\n \nTHEBOOTFITTER:  How about this? --< The truth is that the NT has an overwhelming amount of evidence to support its existence. To confirm its reliability as an accurate historical record, we need to look at how well it coincides with other, independent sources of historical record.\n MILO:  Agreed. That would be one valid way to determine the veracity of Scripture, and it's been done.\n \n --<It's been done. Okay. Let's start with a few items for which I am not aware of any corresponding independent historical records with which we can verify the claims of the NT:\n o The slaughter of the innocents.\n o The census around the time of the birth of Jesus.\n o Jesus tipping over tables in the Jerusalem temple.\n o The earthquake that followed the death of Jesus.\n o The individuals that rose from their graves after Jesus was resurrected.\n \n Can you refer me to independent historical documentation of any of these events? \n\n \n \nYou feel that if one can't provide evidence on every event and statement provided in the Bible, that somehow that shows inconsistency or fault in the scripture?\n\n No. Simply that if there are events recorded in the Bible that cannot be confirmed by independent historical records, it is conceivable that the Bible does not offer an accurate picture of actual physical events in history.\n \n \nI suggest you instead look at the points that have been scoffed at by \"scholars\" in the past, and then borne out in the end. This would include:\n\n You could have at least posted the website from which you copied this information... (I found it verbatim here: http://www.gospelcom.net/faithfacts/maps_a.html) \n \nAll of which you can verify yourself by referencing the many written works. \n\n I'm sorry... Which many written works? Did you reference a written work somewhere and I missed it?\n \n \nI can't go on answering you, but it looks like you have your plate full with what I've given you above. It's up to you to do the research.\n\n Yes, I will take a look at some of the items you put forth because I'm interested in the topic. \n \n \nI can say however that your arguments are 1: arbitrary, and 2: inconsistent.\n\n This is a matter of opinion. I would assert that my position is quite solid: Whatever is, is. Reality is what reality is... not what some individuals believe it to be. I do not claim any knowledge on the fact of Jesus' historical existence. \n \n \nMy position is not. The Bible is internally consistent... \n \n Again, this is a matter of opinion. It is certainly debateable.\n \n \nIn contrast, the non-biblical view is inconsistent. It states that we came from nowhere and are going nowhere, but life is full of meaning in between.\n\n To which non-biblical view are you referring? There are many non-biblical views that suggest where we came from and where we are going. Whether or not life is full of meaning is really a matter of perspective.\n \n \nThe statement \"there are no moral absolutes\" contains two mistakes:\n\n My goodness... you are really all over the place here, aren't you? Who said anything about 'moral absolutes'?\n \n \nSo, ponder these things. And I suggest you stop running around in circles. You're going to make yourself sick. \n\n ???",

   "Follow this...\n Montalban: I know something that cannot be known, do you?\n Mach: Your statement is self-contradictory, and illogical.\n ^^^^\n Montalban: But, but, you claim to know the unknowable!!\n Mach: No, you did.\n Montalban: No, but you contradict yourself.\n Mach: No, you did, and still do.\n\n \n Nice straw-man\n But follow this\n Montalban: I know something about unknowables, and so do you.\n Mach: Your statement is self-contradictory, and illogical.\n Montalban: But you claim to know something about unknowables!!\n Mach: No, you did.\n Montalban: No, you contradict yourself.\n Mach: No, you did, and still do.\n To say \"I know nothing of the unknowable\" is to make a statement that you know at least one thing of  the unknowable; it is something you know nothing about them. You are arguing by re-stating the very proof that undermines your own position. You claim that there is no unknowables.\n What I am saying is that they are there, and you can know that they are there, even if you only know this one thing about them; that they are there. It is not saying \"I know this particular thing that is unknowable\". It is to say \"I know something about unknowables; that they exist\" and therefore it proves that they exist (at the very least at a subjective level)... because you know of them. And you know that they do exist; because you give definitions of them that make a positive statement about them. You don't need to know any more.\n Another example I gave, which parallels this; I don't know your mother. She is unknown. I can know that she is unknown, even if I don't know anything about her. (Certainly she is indeed knowable, but I can still know something about what I don't know; that I don't know your mum.)\n Further, you continue to do state, again and again your own flawed position. And you've not had the decency to address the quotes I've made from you where you can make positive statements about the unknowable; that you know something is unknowable. And this is where dishonesty lies with you. I will continue to re-post these, because they show how very laughable your own double-stance is. I will continue to re-post these until you address them. Why you don't is unknown, but it is intriguing to the readers that you can't do so. You could have nipped this in the bud very early on by stating you have changed your position; which is a fair thing to do. But to go on ignoring these statements undermines any claim you might have to an honest debate.\n \n Post #301 of \"Where does science say we come from\"\n \n \"Where\", would mean where the matter that makes us \"comes from\", or in generally, where the universe comes from. And that, we don't know. And we don't really know if it's even knowable....or relevant \n When...now \"when\" we came is known to some degree. How, is also fairly well understood. Even when they universe came into being is something we think we can know (we have a fairly good idea, at least about how to arrive at it). But where did it all come from? Simply not known and possibly not knowable.\n \n The trouble comes form anyone saying they DO know, without a doubt, where we come from. Those are the one's you have to watch out for.\n \n -mach\n\n So you admit a possibility that unknowables can exist; how do you know? If you claim not to know anything about them.\n \n Post #8 \"Faith cannot seperate (sic) truth from falsity\" on the Philosophy subject\n \nyou claim to know my motives (you cannot)\n\n Then you make a positive statement about something that is unknowable, at least for me. How can you know that it is unkowable to me? You must know at least one thing about it.\n This is a sorry fact; you can't deal with evidence; you can't when I present it from science, nor from your own previous statements. The inability to deal with conflicting evidence is in part based on your own Objectivism; that can not allow you to accept any position you've already dismissed as being unreasonable; no matter whence the source; and this itself is anti-science. Not only do you offer none, you belittle that which is presented; based on your own opinion about the truth of your own statement; allowing you to miss-apply rules of fallacy.\n \n \nEven Nu Leader agrees you're making an illogical claim. \n\n You say he does. Are you now appealing to authority? What a totally laughable argument you make; applying 'rules' in such a sinuous manner that it undermines any pretence to setting out a rational debate. At least present what you believe he says.\n \n \nHaving you constantly deny reality is the goal, it's more enlightening to those reading than anything I could ever get you to admit to. If you cannot admit even a blatantly obvious logical contradiction, why should anyone ever debate with you? Your dishonesty will only distract.\n -Mach\n\n \n This again is your problem of your own ego. You believe that what you state is reality, based on your own statement that it is, repeated so often; like a mantra, you believe it. It is a very sad state of affairs that someone would be so arrogant as to pass off their own faulty logic as truth; of course if you said this to me, you'd add its not an insult, but an observation. If your position is 'reality' please present some evidence. You never do. The closest you've come is to give a definition of unknowable; which itself is ironic that you can give a definition about something you supposedly can't. Further to this is that your own definitions do not include the words \"Does not exist\".\n \n It positively shows that you can know something of the unknowable; that they are unknowable. You need know no more about them.\n \n If you could present some evidence that actually agrees with any of your statements, you would. The odd thing is you seem to be unconcerned with the total lack of supporting evidences for any of your statements of belief. You asked what faith is, this is what you argue from; lack of evidence.\n \n Let's see you statements in summary...\n Mach says you can't know anything about unknowables (unsupported by evidence; Montalban gave evidence from Mach's own previous statements)\n Mach says unknowables don't exist (unsupported by evidence; Montalban gave evidence in support from science)\n Mach says darkness is material (unsupported by evidence; Montalban gave evidence from logic)\n Mach says his version of science is science, not a philosophy of science (unsupported by evidence; Montalban gave evidence from sites on epistemology)\n Mach says creation is illogical (unsupported by evidence)",

I saying that using your criteria to underscore how illogical you have been in applying this notion of \"Appeal to Authority\", because you claim my referencing of science for science is an appeal to authority.\n That is the double-standard you did, and how you miss-applied it to my quoting from science to deal with science. I don't know how to make it more clearer. If, by your reasoning my citations were an appeal to authority, then so were yours, it is to underscore how you miss-applied this.\n IF you believe I did this, then you must concede so did you.\n \nAll you have done in this thread is deny logic.\n\n All you've done is to suggest this.

And, if I say that you in doing all this is illogical, you say that I am being insulting!\n In short your version of debate is to continue to deride all opposition and ignore everything said; simply because you can't face any evidence that differs from your un-supported opinion.\n \n Even your own sources have shown how you miss-apply 'evidence'.\n * You use a dictionary to define science as a means of knowledge, and suggest that it is the ONLY means, even when your own quote doesn't say this, but you believe that it does.\n * You use a dictionary to define unknowable, and again your source doesn't say it doesn't exist, but you simply believe that it does.\n \n You call into question the definition of non-material, but are happy with the definition of material, when both are admittedly vague. This again goes to your bias; selective criticism.\n \n If you had a reasoned debate, you'd give one. If you understood a reasoned debate then you'd actually bother to address any of the citations I gave, but you don't you miss-apply the idea of 'Appeal to Authority' and leave it at that. AND even when I use Aristotle's own words on non-material, a man whom you have referred to as the 'father of logic', you ignore that.\n \n You will continue to ignore the evidence, because it is inconvenient. Most evolutionists have no problem with acknowledging the limits of science in respect to non-material, and unknowables. You are a different case. You will forever continue to ignore inconvenient evidences. You will continue to demand evidences for something you don't believe in and therefore don't believe in any evidence for. Why? Who knows, that's one of the big unknowables.\n \n Your next post will undoubtedly be either to\n a) suggest I've just made an ad hominem\n or\n b) to ask for an answer you've already been given\n or\n c) to ignore any inconvenient evidence.\n or\n d) any or all of the above.\n \n And no doubt you will continue to not address the evidence I presented. This will go on forever until you either give up posting, or change tactic and give a reasoned debate where-in you will actually address any of points i) to iii) above.

Paradox\n \n The red herring (or ignorance of what a paradox is on your part, which is OK, just withdraw the claim, it's NOT EVIDENCE)\n \n \nFinally, an attempt to test your theory! It only took you weeks of mantra to get to this point. There is, of course, paradoxes.  \n \n \n \n\n A paradox is not refutation of the law of contradiction, why would you even suggest that? Furthermore, paradox is defined in such a way that it is not even capable of being used as proof in such a way:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox\n \n Thus a paradox is (theoretically) solvable given more information, while a contradiction (literally, \"speak contrary\") is (theoretically) insolvable on the basis of the information that has already been received. In common parlance the terms are sometimes used synonymously.   \n \n A paradox, in reality, is solvable given more information, but a CONTRADICTION, i.e. Montalban's claim, is insolvable.

I showed you that fuzzy logic, adheres to all fundamental logic, by design.\n\n \n Here's yet another link:\n http://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~gchen/6452/Lec-2.pdf\n \n Fuzzy logic does not refute classic logic, it's therefore irrelevant.\n \n Your claim is not fuzzy.\n \n Knowable\n NOT knowable.\n \n 1\n 0\n \n Yet you persist in misrepresenting what I post. Stick to the topic, stop railing on about false claims and other topics.\n \n =======================\n \n So your scientific claims are bunk, red herrrings, THAT I HAVE ALREADY RESPONDED TO. If you wish to hang onto one of them DO SO. Continue to debate how chaos theory applies to your claim. We can debate further, but you ignore my response, then come back 5 posts later and misrepresent what I post. STOP.\n \n Where is your follow-on about fuzzy logic?

The fallacy in Objectivism is the belief that absolute knowledge and final Truths are attainable through reason, and therefore there can be absolute right and wrong knowledge, and absolute moral and immoral thought and action. For Objectivists, once a principle has been discovered through reason to be True, that is the end of the discussion. If you disagree with the principle, then your reasoning is flawed. If your reasoning is flawed it can be corrected, but if it is not, you remain flawed and do not belong in the group.\n THE UNLIKELIEST CULT IN HISTORY\n BY MICHAEL SHERMER\n http://www.skeptic.com/02.2.shermer-unlikely-cult.html\n \n Therefore he believes that because there is no evidence for creation, unknowables, non-material, etc, then you or I can not give any evidence for it. So every time you or I or anyone else posts a rational debate on this, giving examples for, and/or argument for our position, it has to be ignored, because he already has made up his mind that our position is impossible to begin with, and there simply is no evidence for an alternate position. In understanding this, it might go a bit to understanding why he does ignore the posts presented. However, what is truly odd is why he'd ask for evidence that he doesn't believe exists. Perhaps he hoped to 'show' his statement to be true, but this hasn't happened. All he's done is to re-state his position that opposing positions are illogical, because they are, because they are, because they are.\n \n Nu Leader, you and I will undoubtedly disagree on any number of things (and I will debate you over these in due course). If one of presents an argument, the other would expect a rationalised statement as to why the statement is right or wrong. However Mach believes a repeat of the phrase \"Your statement is illogical. Please provide a logical statement\" is a debate. Even other evolutionists here will offer some form of reason why they disagree. Mach does not, other than to restate his position, that it is, because it is, because it is.\n \n Related to the quote above...\n \"Why do so many Objectivists insist on attacking the honesty, integrity, and character of their opponents? Are such attacks an aberration, or is this sort of behavior actually advocated by Objectivism?\"\n http://www.jeffcomp.com/faq/wrong.htm\n \n The problem is because these people have 'reasoned' their way to a position, it is 'true', and every other position is false, and therefore they see it as justified to state it is false. Because of this misplaced conviction they do have, to some degree, an honest belief that what they say is true. However, many people on this forum hold their position to be true. All but one give a reason for holding that position.\n \n \nPlease show us specifcally, how your claim [I know something of the unknowable] is NOT a logical contradiction.\n\n \n \nI did in a previous message, but once again, you have shown your ignorance and ignored it.

At the moment, you two are probably losing quite a lot of respect from fellow members by willingly ignoring or misunderstanding the other persons point.\n\n I too posted a reasoned debate, but as similar to the point above, he can't differentiate because he believes there is no reason other than his and he'll again continue to demand one.. which itself is odd, because he doesn't believe there is one. SO, when I present evidence from science and other sources on unknowables (See Appendix below) for him it just doesn't exist because it doesn't.\n This will go on forever, unfortunately, unless he decides to engage in a debate that consists of evidence, other than his own opinion that is, because it is, because it is.

   "Hi Mach:\n As has been displayed before, creation is not irrational to begin with - in fact, it is more rational to believe in creation than atheistic evolution! You can, however, rant and rave about how irrational and illogical my view is - but know that you have no evidence to prove such a point.\n \n\n \n On the contrary. You agreed that \"knowing the unknowable\" is a contradiction. In this case, the concept of Montalban's God begins with his description of his god, which was that part of his God was unknowable, and that Montalban knows this (hence, the claim.) \n \n The claim is illogical. In his case, with god being unknowable, it's illogical/irrational. I'm neither ranting, nor raving, I'm explaining it to you in the clearest way I can.\n \n If you wish to use a different definition than Montalban for you god, by all means, do so. If you wish to use the same definition, two things occur:\n \n #1 you contradict your previous claim:\n \n \nFrom a staight forward reading and using your definition of knowable it translates to:\n \"I know something of [or about] what cannot be known\".\n \n Which is, an appearent contradiction. \n \n \n #2 Your claim is illogical, since it's the same as the claim Montalban makes.\n \n Are you suggsting my logic is incorrect? If not, what is incorrect? You accuse me of not reading, but I suspect what you're really wondering is why I don't debate in circles with montalban. If we start with an illogical claim, there is no point in going further, the rest would just be make-believe.\n \n \nI did in a previous message, but once again, you have shown your ignorance and ignored it. You most likely are not on the save wavelength with montalban and thus do not know what he truely means.\n\n \n Truly, I have no idea what your claiming to know about me here, other than perhaps I am reasonable, and some others, are not. I suggest you stop, it sounds personal, and we don't need personal comments on a public debate forum that's off-topic.\n \n \n Why do people try the logical thing when there is some misunderstanding, and use active listening? Active listening involves letting the other person express their views and you asking simple questions to help them clarify their position. Then, montalban will listen and ask simple questions to help you clarify your position. Simple questions may be, \"What do you define as the unknowable?\" and so on. At the moment, you two are probably losing quite a lot of respect from fellow memebers by willingly ignoring or misunderstanding the other persons point.\n\n \n lol. This is absurd, you obviously don't read Montalban's posts, or you are knowingly arguing for a particular side withour regards to the evidence on this forum. If you have a claim about evolution or creation, please make it. You can drop the personal discussion, it's off-topic.\n \n \n By all means, point out where my claim, about Montalban's illogical claim, is faulty. Please do this. That way you can practice what you preach.\n \n -Mach",

   "I've already done this a dozen times. But here we go again...\n\n \n Sorry to say Montalban, I suspect I know already what your issues are, and I think two things will be shown to be true.\n #1 None of this will be relevant to your claim being illogical\n #2 It will be a monumental waste of time, one I will indulge you in since it's the weekend.\n \n Let's test those two claims:\n \n ----------------------------------------------------------\n Here you suggest that something might possibly be unknowable... or as you term it... not knowable\n Post #301 of \"Where does science say we come from\"\n ==============================================\n \nWhen...now \"when\" we came is known to some degree. How, is also fairly well understood. Even when they universe came into being is something we think we can know (we have a fairly good idea, at least about how to arrive at it). But where did it all come from? Simply not known and possibly not knowable. The trouble comes form anyone saying they DO know, without a doubt, where we come from. Those are the one's you have to watch out for.\n\n What in reality do I suggest is unknowable?\n If I suggest a concept is unknowable: I.e. square circle, or, non-existence.\n Contractions in langage 2+2=4, 2+2=5. Did the universe just shut down or can we write or say or think whatever we like? Now, what we are discussing is a claim of existence.\n \n God is real, and exists, and is unknowable\n \n This is why your claim, is different, you suggest KNOWLEDGE of something in REALITY, that EXISTS. \n Once again, for the hundredth time, I DO NOT CLAIM TO KNOW ANYTHING UNKNOWABLE EXISTS.\n \n \n \nHere you give an aspect of you that is unknowable (at least to me).\n\n Monkey business. Is this the gem of evidence that makes your claim NOT a contradiction? What a waste of time to even post it. Nu Leader is right, we are on different wavelengths.\n \n If you were capable and sincere, you'd know, without me needing to tell you, that such a claim HAS NO IMPACT ON THE ILLOGICAL CONTRADICTION YOU MAKE. It's a red herring. \n \n I claim you cannot read my mind and I make my claim as 99.9999999% certainty. If you can, please provide evidence to back your claim. Either way, my claim is open to being false, albeit, if you CAN read my mind, go collect the $1M from Randi and gloat. Montalban now claims he can read minds? Tell us. \n \n - CAN YOU READ MY MIND.\n - CAN YOU NOT READ MY MIND.\n \n Which is it?\n \n \nYet you use Aristotle in a debate to 'prove' my statements are illogical.\n\n \n No, I use logic.\n You asked the source, I gave you a source.\n I show you the logic, not a link to aristotle, as my evidence.\n \n If you wish to claim the law of contradiction is not a fundamental part of logic, by all means, do so. Else, you accept it. Your call.\n \n ====================================================\n \n Now we're getting nowhere, but we're getting there fast!\n \n You have two remaining questions. TWO, not twenty, not thirty, TWO.\n So let's tackle these two, shall we? Just you and I, without your appeals to authority. \n \n \nAfter responding to this all you need to do is address the following...\n\n What, explain to you what each of these people claim in detail, and how it relates to your logical contradiction?\n \n Please read your authority links, and in your own words (so you don't post fallacy as evidence), describe to me, why chaos theory shows that:\n \"I know the unknowable\"\n Is not a contradictiory claim.\n \n I have read about chaos theory, and claim chaos theory is a theory, that does nothing to refute classical logical as applied to basic english concepts.\n \n Quoting Kant as your evidence is an appeal to authority. I cannot debate Kant, he's not here. I can however, debate you, if you choose to participate. You will need to show us, using Kant as a reference if you like (which you seem to be suggesting here), to show why:\n \n I know something of the unknowable\n \n Is not a logical contradiction.\n \n The burden of evidence is on you, my claim stands clearly presented, I will NOT present my side, and your side, if you are too lazy to detail it for us in your own words, then by all means, you'll leave your appeals to authority as \"evidence\" of nothing.\n \n You only have TWO things to pursue here, back your claims, let's see where you go with this. Hopefully it is away from appeal to authority, and towards you demonstrating how your claim is not illogical.\n \n -Mach",

   "I apologize in advance for the length of this post. I attempted to clarify my main points at the end of my most recent post to re-focus this discussion. Evidently that didn't work. \n\n \n It might work, if you actually did it - but you didn't.\n \n Milo:  Evidence is not proof.\n --<You've got a point here.\n \n Milo:  All these things are conceivable, but the real question is, are they reasonable? \n --<If you wish to discuss reasonability, then you've got a much bigger task to show the bible is reasonable than I do to show that it's conceivable that Jesus may not have been historical.\n \n \nIs it reasonable to think that a human being walked on water? Or fed several thousand people with a few loaves of bread? Or was resurrected from the dead? No doubt it's conceivable. I'm not stating that those things DIDN'T happen. Just that there are other explanations that are potentially more reasonable. :-)\n\n \n Was it reasonable to believe in black holes 100 years ago? No, but you do today. Why? Because you were shown the evidence. Was it reasonable to believe that man would go to the moon 200 years ago? No. You believe it today because you saw the evidence. Don't get silly on me here.\n \n \n \nMilo:  I contend the evidence does support the Bible's assertions. \n --<Yes, that's what you contend. But what evidence? Where? Show me an example, please.\n\n \n You're kidding right? See post 146 in which I point out much of the documented extra Biblical evidence that supports its claims. You'll need to read my posts more carefully if you want the answers to your questions. Just stating they haven't been an answered is silly. You just look foolish when you do so.\n \n \n \nI'm sorry... what? Who said anything about 'Darwinism'? If you wish to discuss 'Darwinism,' you can certainly do so, but it is not relevant to our current discussion. And, quite frankly, I'm not interested in discussing 'Darwinism.' I don't even know what you are referring to with the term 'Darwinism.'\n\n \n I said something about Darwinism. It is relevant to our discussion, as it is to this thread. If you wish to disregard the comparison you can do that, but it's still a vaild comparison and we are (or should be) addressing evolution. Are you embarrassed by it?\n \n \nAs you suggest, you are starting with a premise that is questionable.\n Yes. That's why evidence is provided. \n A conclusion drawn from a questionable premise cannot be without question itself. \n Agreed.\n \n \nI think you are suggesting here that essentially, accepting the Bible as historical is a matter of faith. If not, please clarify.\n\n \n I'm saying there is objective evidence that supports the historical evidence of the writings of the Bible. Enough of that evidence has been provided and verified for one to believe it is a true and accurated document. See post #146.\n \n \n \nExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The Bible makes several extraordinary claims. \n Agreed, but not without evidence that has been verified by outside sources. See post #146. \n \n \n \nI am not here to dispute the accuracy of transmission from copy to copy to copy. I stated quite clearly in my most recent post that the accuracy of transmission has nothing to do with whether or not the content that is being transmitted is an accurate description of historical events.\n It shows supernatural influence, especially when combined with the way it was written. Show me another example that can stand up to the method the books were put together, as I gave above, with the writings having been compiled over 1500 years, by 40 different authors, each with different backgrounds, in three different languages, over three continents, yet all with one unified message, and I'll take a look at it.\n \n \n \nI'm not even aware that there is independent historical evidence to suggest that the apostles were historical characters. Regardless... There are certainly other examples of people who have died for beliefs that have no apparent basis in reality. Remember Waco, TX?\n\n \n See post #146\n \n \n \nUnified message? Hoo-boy... Let's save this one for another thread... perhaps in the Biblical Contradictions forum. Suffice it to say that your claim that the Bible has a \"unified message as if written by one source\" is debateable.\n Show me one contradiction that can't be argued sucessfully? One contradiction that hasn't been answered? If you can, then maybe that contradiction is valid. If you can't,then there's no reason to believe it's any more valid than the assertion itself.\n \n \n \nUmmm... I asked you to provide independent historical evidence to show that the Bible story accurately portrays history on earth. It appears you missed it... Here it is again (including the background that led to it) --<\n See post #146. You really need to read it. The evidence is supported (mostly) by independent archeological finds that the Bible spoke of, and that were laughed at, prior to their verifications by \"science\".\n \n \nNo. Simply that if there are events recorded in the Bible that cannot be confirmed by independent historical records, it is conceivable that the Bible does not offer an accurate picture of actual physical events in history.\n See post #146.\n \n \n \nYou could have at least posted the website from which you copied this information... (I found it verbatim here: http://www.gospelcom.net/faithfacts/maps_a.html)\n\n \n Sorry, thought I did. Does that matter? Are it's claims any less accurate? If so, please explain how. You could be accused of the same. I found some of your statements to be right off the web - some from \"TalkOrigins\". I'll admit, I don't have all the citations memorized. I can see you don't either.\n \n \nI'm sorry... Which many written works? Did you reference a written work somewhere and I missed it?\n\n \n Not sure what you're referencing here.\n \n \n \nYes, I will take a look at some of the items you put forth because I'm interested in the topic.\n\n \n Please do. \n \n \n \nThis is a matter of opinion. I would assert that my position is quite solid: Whatever is, is. Reality is what reality is... not what some individuals believe it to be. I do not claim any knowledge on the fact of Jesus' historical existence.\n\n \n I would argue that reality is that which most closely correspondes to our human experience. \n \n \n [quote]To which non-biblical view are you referring? There are many non-biblical views that suggest where we came from and where we are going. Whether or not life is full of meaning is really a matter of perspective.[quote]\n \n True, but as I point out, if a view is inconsistent, it fails. I don't know of anyone if they're going to be honest) that hasn't found at least some meaning in life - do you? Most would say it is full of meaning.\n \n \n \nMy goodness... you are really all over the place here, aren't you? Who said anything about 'moral absolutes'?\n\n \n Sorry about that, I meant \"there are no absolutes\", not \"moral\" absolutes. It's not really all over the place, since most of your position is a relative one, which suggests that you can find no concrete belief. You seem to suggest that nothing is absolute in your statements, in light of the fact that I've provided you with evidence to the contrary - again see post #146.",
