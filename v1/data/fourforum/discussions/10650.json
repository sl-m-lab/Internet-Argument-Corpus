   ":) Europe's top envoy to Malaysia, Thierry Rommel, had twice this year slammed Malaysia's 37-year-old New Economic Policy, or NEP, that provides privileges in jobs, education, business and other areas for ethnic Malays. In his second blunt mesage to Malaysia, the European Union's outgoing ambassador, Thierry Rommel, described Malaysia as a virtual one-party state that discriminates against ethnic minorities and foreign investors by openly favouring the majority Malay Muslims.\n \n News of his criticisms on both occasions this year can be found on the following websites:\n \n http://www.bloglah.org/Jeffooi/2007/06/25/Thierry_Rommel_and_EU_s_relevance_to_Malaysia\n \n http://www.eubusiness.com/news_live/1182423616.45/view\n \n http://asia.news.yahoo.com/070624/3/33tnb.html\n \n http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2007/06/21/eu_envoy_blasts_malaysias_nep/\n \n http://the-malaysian.blogspot.com/2007/11/eus-outgoing-ambassador-says-malaysia.html\n \n For those who are interested in Malaysia, the following video clips entitled \"Negaraku\" on the YouTube website http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=NegaraKu&search=Search&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&spell=1 may provide some interesting insights into the state of affairs of that Malay Muslim-dominated country with \"special rights\" over the other ethnic communities.",

Whatever the government is supposed to give us, to look after our welfare, well, they have failed.\"\n \n Some ethnic Indians, who make up about 7 percent of the population, complain that they are marginalised in terms of employment and business opportunities by a government dominated by politicians from the majority race, the ethnic Malays.\n \n ......Some shouted \"No democracy in Malaysia, no human rights in Malaysia\". Placards read: \"We too fought for the independence of this country. Why neglect our rights?\"\n \n One protester, K K Krishna, said ethnic Indians were badly under-represented in Malaysian universities. \"Why is that -- are Indians stupid?\" he said.\n \n P. Uthaya Kumar, the rally organiser and legal adviser, said the group had sent letters and appeals to the prime minister and the government over the past five years, asking for a dialogue.\n \n \"They don't respond to us, they don't reply,\" he told the crowd....\n \n \"They are threatening us like a dog,\" said engineer Sara Vicriman, from the northern state of Penang. \"They don't want to give education places for Indians, they don't want to give any opportunities for Indians to do any business.\"\n \n .....Malaysia bans public assemblies of more than five people without a police permit.

   "emoticon_smile The articles in the following websites explain the causes of the social and economic plight of the Malaysian Indians.\n \n 1. In the website http://powerpresent.blogspot.com/2007/08/more-pics-500-malaysian-indians-protest.html, there is an interesting quotation about the plight of the Malaysian Indians and the viscous circle they are trapped in: \"For every step they took, they are 3 steps behind others.\"\n \n 2. Next, let's see what C.S. Kuppuswamy has to tell us in his article from the website http://www.saag.org/papers3/paper213.htm\n \n (Begin excerpts)\n .....Despite the fact that the Indians constitute about 8% of the country's total population of 22 million they own only 1.0% of its national wealth. The bulk of the Indian population which formed the backbone of the country's labour force is also gradually losing out in this field with the influx of Indonesian workers.\n \n The Indians themselves are to some extent, responsible for their present unenviable and ignominious status, though the policies of the Malaysian Government since independence had not been helpful . Ignorance born out of poverty in the plantations resulted in many of them not getting citizenship which was offered in 1957 when Malaysia became independent. This prevented them from getting jobs.\n \n More than 50% of Indians work in plantations or as labourers and menial workers in the cities . Indians rank lowest in national elementary school examinations and the maximum drop-outs are from the Indian community. Since the bulk of the Indians are poor, gangsterism and drug trafficking are also common with this community. According to the statistics published in Asiaweek (Jan 26,2001), \"the Indians account for 63% of those arrested under the Emergency ordinance for violent crimes, 41% of beggars and 20% of child abusers in the country are Indians.\"\n \n Unlike the Chinese, who lay great stress on education, it is not considered as an investment by the Indian working class. The Tamil schools in the estates are often mere apologies and provide no opportunity for progress in higher education. The undue insistence on Tamil education by the Tamil politicians weakens the Indian community further in competing with the indigenous Malays and the Chinese. The better-off urban Indians are trying to improve their lot by sending their children for university education abroad. One of the major reasons for the low percentage of Indian origin students in the tertiary institutions in the country is the lack of merit and as a result, even the quotas set for Indians remains unutilised. The politically articulate Indians blame the Indian community's plight on the failure of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), the leading political party of the Indians.\n \n The MIC is portraying itself as the only party representing the community's interests. The party, a constituent of the coalition government at the centre since independence does not have much political clout and has not been able to do anything substantial to improve the lot of the Indians. There is constant infighting among the party leaders. Another major irritant is the animosity between the Tamils and the non-Tamils. The Tamils constitute about 80% of the total Indian community in Malaysia. The MIC is steadily losing its credibility in Malaysian politics which is polarised on racial lines despite claims to the contrary.\n \n The Malaysian Government policies since independence have also been consistently to the detriment of the non-Malays in general though the Indian community seems to be most hard hit. The first major step was the introduction of work permits for the non-citizens when a majority of Indian workers had not obtained Malaysian citizenship. Subsequently in 1971 with its New Economic Policy, the Government championed the cause of the Malays by the policy of \"Bhumiputras\"(sons of the soil). The Bhumiputras were to have a major share in the public sector while the private sector remained secure with the Chinese. The introduction of quotas for the different races in the educational institutions has also adversely affected the Indian community. The New Development Plan for the period 1991-2000 is also designed to achieve the socio-economic upliftment of the Bhumiputras and the MIC's efforts to place the Indians in a separate ethnic grouping seems to have made no headway with the Malaysian Government. Being a minority, they do not have the numerical strength to exert any political influence nor do they make any significant contribution to the national economy. Hence the ruling government's apathy to the Indians is understandable...... (End excerpts)\n \n 3. Lastly, let's look at the excerpts from an article by M Nadarajah from the website http://www.indianmalaysian.com/middle_age_crisis.htm\n \n (Begin excerpts)\n .....Coming back, the Indian Malaysians unable to deal with their crumbling world moved from rural poverty to urban poverty. And even 40 odd years of independence, with the Indian rubber tapper labouring community - mostly Tamils - even now not guaranteed a minimum wage, a minister with the Malaysian government had the cheek to say that he did not know what the rubber tappers really did behind the rubber tree!\n \n That is symtomatic of our insensitivity to history or justice. Or our gratefulness to our own people. The Indian Malaysian community is a poor minority exhibiting all the problems of a poor minority in a multi-ethnic environment. Left to fend for itself - unlike the protected Malay community - within an ethnically charged environment, it constantly faced a great deal of obstacles.\n \n These problems started early. In the sixties, my brother was working as a door-to-door salesman selling books. As he knocked the door of a non-Indian Malaysian home, he heard one say, \"Find out what that black bastard outside wants.\"\n \n In a chat with a young frustrated Indian Malaysian student of mine, I was informed that she was told by a non-Indian employer \"If not for your colour, we would have employed you.\"\n \n After completing his hotel management course, the son of a friend of mine - quite a dark-skinned person - wanted to join the \"front office\" of a hotel, which a \"visible position\". To his disappointment, he found that it was quite difficult for a dark skinned person to occupy such a position. He was given a position in the \"house keeping\" department, a \"behind-the-scene\" department.\n \n If you are a fair skinned Indian, close to appearing like Sharukh Khan, perhaps you will have an opportunity in this country. I have watched the plight of a pregnant Indian Malaysian woman, with a big bag of goods she had shopped in a nearby supermarket, trying to get the attention of a taxi driver. The person who finally stopped to pick her up was an Indian taxi driver....... (End excerpts)",

These people only respond to things that they can use to make themselves feel superior. \n Don't feel all alone though. The free nations of the world who \"all\" lean to the left in this day and age, only think that freedom applies to them. They do not consider your nation worthy of making the sacrifice to ensure freedom for you and your countrymen. IE: Iraq. The battle for freedom has never been cheap. It has always required \"blood\". Always will. Your nation must have something to offer theirs before they will notice you. Be prepared to die, be prepared for hell to achieve your freedom.",
