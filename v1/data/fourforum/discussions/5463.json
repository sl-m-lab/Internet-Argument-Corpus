   "The crux of the abortion argument these days seems to be the issue of the pregnant woman's right to privacy versus the fetus' right to \"life.\" What about the doctor's rights? What about the hippocratic oath? A doctor has the obligation to act in his/her patients' best interests, and in the case of all prenatal medicine, it is the pregnant woman who is the patient, not the fetus. Shouldn't a doctor be able to act in the interests of the patient without fear of imprisonment? IIRC, this was the issue most important to Justice Harry Blackmun (a conservative appointed by Richard Nixon) who authored the court's opinion on Roe v. Wade.\n The Roe v. Wade Opinion\n \n \nJames Hubert Hallford, a licensed physician, sought and was granted leave to intervene in Roe's action. In his complaint he alleged that he had been arrested previously for violations of the Texas abortion statutes and that two such prosecutions were pending against him. He described conditions of patients who came to him seeking abortions, and he claimed that for many cases he, as a physician, was unable to determine whether they fell within or outside the exception recognized by Article 1196. He alleged that, as a consequence, the statutes were vague and uncertain, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that they violated his own and his patients' rights to privacy in the doctor-patient relationship and his own right to practice medicine, rights he claimed were guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\n",
