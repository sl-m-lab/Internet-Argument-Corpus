Those states that do consume the most porn tend to be more conservative and religious than states with lower levels of consumption, the study finds.\n \"Some of the people who are most outraged turn out to be consumers of the very things they claimed to be outraged by,\" Edelman says.\n You can see why this \"finding\" appeals to journalists. It is counterintuitive, while at the same time reinforcing a disparaging liberal stereotype of conservatives: that their moralistic attitudes about sex reflect their own repressed desires. Really, though, this is far more compelling as an example of how journalists, egged on by attention-seeking scholars, misuse science by overstating its conclusions to fit their own preconceptions.\n A look at the actual study--available here, though ABC omits the link--shows that it is far from conclusive. Edelman used data from only one adult-entertainment company. He concedes that \"it is difficult to confirm rigorously that this seller is representative\" and makes no evident effort to do so. And contrary to his New Scientist quote, the study tells us nothing about \"the people who are most outraged.\"\n Such correlations as he finds are only among states and ZIP codes. New Scientist touts the finding that John McCain carried \"eight of the top 10 pornography consuming states\" to justify the headline's conclusion that \"Conservatives Are Biggest Consumers.\"\n To understand why this is a non sequitur, look at the Census Bureau's report on the black population, and specifically the state-by-state table on page 4. The four states with the most blacks as a percentage of population--Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina and Georgia--all went for McCain. By Edelman's logic, this would point to the conclusion that blacks are the most reliable GOP voters. The reality, of course, is more complex: Blacks in fact overwhelmingly vote Democratic, and states in the Deep South tend to have both large black populations and very conservative white voters.\n A few days after the 2000 election, in his debut column for OpinionJournal.com, Pete du Pont made an observation (with no pretense of scientific rigor) that runs directly counter to Edelman's finding:\n In the Oct. 23 New York Times appeared a shaded map of the United States that bore an eerie resemblance to Tuesday night's results. In an article headlined \"Technology Sent Wall Street Into Market for Pornography,\" the map shows by region the percentage of sex movies in the home-video market. Mr. Gore carried the areas with the highest percentages (40% on the West Coast and 37% in New England and the Middle Atlantic states); Mr. Bush carried the area with the lowest percentage (14% in the South), and they split the rest of the country that had middling sex movie percentages.\n This may help explain Edelman's findings, such as they are. Back in the 20th century, the home-video market consisted in significant part of rentals and purchases from local retailers. Local laws and mores make retail porn less available in conservative areas--which might also account for their greater consumption of porn online, which gives at least the illusion of privacy.\n Indeed, the New York Times article du Pont referenced (the map isn't included in the online version, alas) begins with an anecdote about pay-per-view porn in Utah--which is also the state with the highest rate of subscriptions to Edelman's adult-entertainment provider.\n There's another problem with Edelman's study, which New Scientist ignores: the denominator. To calculate the subscription rate, he divides the number of subscriptions in a given state by the total number of residents who have broadband Internet service. He acknowledges the problem with this method, but quickly dismisses it:\n In principle, my analysis of subscription patterns to online adult entertainment websites could suffer from reverse causation: That is, interest in adult entertainment could cause users to obtain broadband Internet access, whereas my analysis takes broadband access as given. If users obtain broadband to improve their ability to access adult entertainment, regression estimates would be biased towards zero. Thus, to the extent that my analysis yields correlations that appear to be statistically significant, reverse causation does not taint the significance of the estimates.\n This is true only if one assumes that the reverse-causation factor--the tendency to get broadband in order to get porn, rather than for other reasons--is evenly distributed across states. But it seems quite plausible that in states where retail porn is harder to get, a greater number of consumers get broadband in order to get porn. Since the numerator (porn subscribers) is much smaller than the denominator (broadband users), this effect would have a much more pronounced effect on the numerator, and therefore on the differences in rates among states.\n Even given all that, however, Edelman's findings don't amount to much, as he explains in the concluding paragraph of his study:\n On the whole, these adult entertainment subscription patterns show a remarkable consistency: all but eleven states have between two and three subscribers to this service per thousand broadband households, and all but four have between 1.5 and 3.5. With interest in online adult entertainment relatively constant across regions, there's little sign of a major divide.\n Indeed, Utah has only 1.69 subscriptions per thousand people. The Beehive State's population is 2.7 million, according to the latest census estimate. That means the total number of Utahns who subscribe to the porn service Edelman analyzes is less than 5,000--quite a small number on which to conclude that the place is full of moralistic deviants.\n \n \n *******************************************************\n \n ...and here\n \n http://people.hbs.edu/bedelman/papers/redlightstates.pdf\n \n is the actual study...sans embellishment by biased journalism.\n \n Have a great day!\n \n Nice try though.

   "Since foundit seems to have had enough based on isly's very damming evidence of what his so called study actually represents. Let me further expose the hypocrisy of posting this thread by allowing a liberal debutante to speak for the Left as she gives her moral perspective about the right and wrong of pornography. As you will see, the leftists who seek to indict conservatives regarding this morally degrading practice hold the position as in all other aspects of their lives that if it feels good and right to the individual, then of course it is ok and should be participated in without shame of embarrassment. \n \n Yet, being the hypocrites that they are, they will turn right around with a fallacious study such as foundit has posted here and falsely attempt to condemn conservatives for doing what they themselves see nothing wrong with doing themselves. LIBERALS, THY NAME IS HYPOCRITE! emoticon_xdonno Here's an excerpt of the meat of her message. It offers absolutely no depth or insight into the moral costs of porn at all. \n \n After days of contemplation I have decided that porn is speech, and people shouldn&#8217;t be afraid to let out information that they like that speech, or have been involved with that speech. I think porn stars should be able to freely list it as previous job on their resume and that people should be able to rent it without feeling ashamed when they walk up to the counter at the video store. Sex is natural, sexual arousal is natural and needing help to become sexually aroused is completely normal. I obviously think child porn is wrong&#8230; If I lived in the States, my argument would thus be that porn is completely within the coverage of the First Amendment.\n The fact that pornography strikes up debates within feminist groups, and raises issues and ideas about class, gender and race shows that pornography conveys and communicates ideas and a premise therefore it should be protected as free speech.\n When someone watches porn, they may not realize it or make the connection, but they are is mediated thought. The viewer is aiming at a particular frame of mind, and the intention of having the pornography is to control the thoughts. A law that prevents shooting up heroin is protecting people from a body disabling and physically disastrous abuse, rather then preventing a person from thinking.\n I don&#8217;t believe that casual induction into pornography will disable a person&#8217;s social skills. I also don&#8217;t think a husband who reads playboy is tearing apart a family, I think there are some communication issues - but if that&#8217;s where he wants his thoughts to be, that&#8217;s where they are going to be. Some of the most celebrated movies, pieces of art and compositions of music have been created out of the freedom of thought, and out of the ability to allow one to stagger into dangerous areas of the mind. Sexuality, in this same idea, can be seen as an art form to a person, and pornography is a way to lead your thoughts into areas of exploration resulting in something more enjoyable, more exciting and more interesting.\n We don&#8217;t confine an artists mind from exploring the darkest corners, so why should we put shame on those who want to wander into the unknown world of sexuality and get help with being sexually aroused? We shouldn&#8217;t.\n Porn in my life - Liberal Debutante",

   "Hey foundit, Where'd you GO? Have you no response to isly's refutation of your propaganda piece/study? I understand it's difficult to refute actual facts but that has never stopped you before. \n\n Archie, I didn't go anywhere.\n The number of posts I don't see or respond to vastly outnumbers the number I do. So don't try to pretend any moral victory just cause I haven't gotten to responding yet. I typically don't read the threads in this section.\n Beyond that, I would love to pick your brain to see if you actually understand isly's response document. I'm betting you just like the fact that it says the other study is wrong, without having clue one as to what isly's document actually means...\n \n But let's go to the tape...\n \n \n \nWhat you missed is that I implied that the losing party IN EVERY STATE, whether red or blue, could have purchased the most porn. In no way did I say that either party purchased the most porn, nor did I differentiate between red and blue states.\n\n Quite frankly, that makes absolutely no sense.\n So conservatives in the blue states will buy more porn because why? Cause they are in a blue state?\n And liberals in the red states will buy more porn because why? Cause they arein a red state?\n Your excuses lack any cogent theory behind the scenario.\n \n In science, when people put forth a hypothesis they provide a basis for their claim as to the mechanics of the phenomenon.\n But with you, you just throw out different ideas with no basis.\n \n \n \nHone up on your comprehension skills and start another thread.\n Perhaps you can wade through this first and see that I am hardly off base.\n\n The follow-on commentary you bring up is substantially different from the variety of excuses you have thrown out.\n The only thing it really has in common is coming up with a different excuse for claiming the original article is wrong.\n \n \n \nA look at the actual study--available here, though ABC omits the link--shows that it is far from conclusive. Edelman used data from only one adult-entertainment company. He concedes that \"it is difficult to confirm rigorously that this seller is representative\" and makes no evident effort to do so. And contrary to his New Scientist quote, the study tells us nothing about \"the people who are most outraged.\"\n\n Speaking of trivial complaints.\n At best, this really just comes down to an idea that there is a specific type of porn that appeals more to the conservative user, while hypothesizing that there could be other forms of porn that would have a different appeal distribution.\n As with many of these \"scientific study\" complaints, the complaint itself loses sight of the bigger picture and fails to recognize how trivial the complaint truly is.\n \n Plus, I refer to the study itself...\n \"the seller runs literally hundreds of sites offering a broad range of adult entertainment\".\n The skeptic tosses out a half-baked idea with no follow-through, ignoring the real nature of the data available.\n \n \n \nSuch correlations as he finds are only among states and ZIP codes. New Scientist touts the finding that John McCain carried \"eight of the top 10 pornography consuming states\" to justify the headline's conclusion that \"Conservatives Are Biggest Consumers.\"\n To understand why this is a non sequitur, look at the Census Bureau's report on the black population, and specifically the state-by-state table on page 4. The four states with the most blacks as a percentage of population--Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina and Georgia--all went for McCain. By Edelman's logic, this would point to the conclusion that blacks are the most reliable GOP voters. The reality, of course, is more complex: Blacks in fact overwhelmingly vote Democratic, and states in the Deep South tend to have both large black populations and very conservative white voters.\n\n This argument here demonstrates a rather fundamental oversight on the part of the author. He fails to realize a rather significant difference inbetween his analogy, and the originating article.\n \n With the states and conservatives vs republicans, we're talking about states which are shifted in population MAJORITY from liberals to conservatives.\n With his reply analogy, he takes \"the most blacks as a percentage of population\", but fails to note that we're still dealing with a MINORITY segment.\n Blacks do not make up a majority in those states. They are still a minority.\n Plus, while Edelman examined BOTH ends of the spectrum, the author of this article is coming at it backwards. Edelman examined the states which had the MOST porn, and the LEAST porn. Multiple spectrum data ponts.\n \n To further the analogy (ignoring the previous significant discrepancy), the author should actually look at the states which have the MOST blacks, and the states which have the LEAST blacks, and perform the analysis. Those states are Montana, Idaho, Vermont, Maine, and North Dakota, Wyoming, Utah, South Dakota. FIVE of those seven went to McCain as well, with the least blacks.\n If the author had been as thorough as Edelman, he would have noticed that his hypothesis falls apart on the other end of the spectrum.\n Or maybe he did notice that and didn't want to admit it.\n \n So this analysis falls apart on two levels.\n 1) Blacks are not the majority in ANY of those four states.\n 2) Looking at the \"least black\" end of the spectrum, his analysis falls apart.\n \n \n \nIn the Oct. 23 New York Times appeared a shaded map of the United States that bore an eerie resemblance to Tuesday night's results. In an article headlined \"Technology Sent Wall Street Into Market for Pornography,\" the map shows by region the percentage of sex movies in the home-video market. Mr. Gore carried the areas with the highest percentages (40% on the West Coast and 37% in New England and the Middle Atlantic states); Mr. Bush carried the area with the lowest percentage (14% in the South), and they split the rest of the country that had middling sex movie percentages.\n\n Wow. Talk about gross over-generalization...\n The map broke down into JUST FOUR PARTS. That's it. JUST four.\n With Edelman's analysis, you had 50 states to look at.\n \n \n \nThis may help explain Edelman's findings, such as they are. Back in the 20th century, the home-video market consisted in significant part of rentals and purchases from local retailers. Local laws and mores make retail porn less available in conservative areas--which might also account for their greater consumption of porn online, which gives at least the illusion of privacy.\n\n This almost borders on dishonesty.\n The data in Edelman's article didn't come from \"back in the 20th century\". It came from 2006-2008.\n And you don't have just \"local retailers\". People can go to magazines and/or online DVD sales to purchase material.\n The other stuff IS available.\n \n \n \nThere's another problem with Edelman's study, which New Scientist ignores: the denominator. To calculate the subscription rate, he divides the number of subscriptions in a given state by the total number of residents who have broadband Internet service. He acknowledges the problem with this method, but quickly dismisses it:\n In principle, my analysis of subscription patterns to online adult entertainment websites could suffer from reverse causation: That is, interest in adult entertainment could cause users to obtain broadband Internet access, whereas my analysis takes broadband access as given. If users obtain broadband to improve their ability to access adult entertainment, regression estimates would be biased towards zero. Thus, to the extent that my analysis yields correlations that appear to be statistically significant, reverse causation does not taint the significance of the estimates.\n\n AGAIN, throwing out half-baked ideas with no substantiation.\n Does ANYBODY here know of ANYBODY who got internet access BECAUSE OF their desire for porn?\n Wow!\n \n And going a step further, what states is he talking about? What restrictions are ACTUALLY in place?\n I've lived in a variety of states. Red and Blue. The \"retail\" access was always there.\n The author completely fails to give any specifics as to what \"retail\" prevention is actually in place.\n We've long passed the days of Larry Flynt's trials. The \"right\" to free speech, and its example of porn, IS FULLY here. It has been for some time.\n \n \n \nOn the whole, these adult entertainment subscription patterns show a remarkable consistency: all but eleven states have between two and three subscribers to this service per thousand broadband households, and all but four have between 1.5 and 3.5. With interest in online adult entertainment relatively constant across regions, there's little sign of a major divide.\n\n Wow.\n The porn rate DOUBLES in his range, and he considers that to be insignificant?\n The author is trying to ignore the fact that the SCALE actually increases rather dramatically, by focusing on \"small number\" mentality.\n \n The growth between 1.5 and 3.5 is 133%.\n But the author tries to pretend that isn't significant...\n Amazing!",
