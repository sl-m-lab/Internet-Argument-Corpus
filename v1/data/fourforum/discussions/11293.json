Consider this if you will:\n 1 \n Prenatal Memory and Learning: \n our Intelligent Fetuses \n By Soumy Ana. August 2003- Rajab 1424 \n -------------------------------------------- \n Twins have been seen developing certain gestures and habits at twenty weeks \n gestational age which persist into their postnatal years, such as games that they would \n typically play in the womb with a membrane separating the both of them. \n Fetuses quickly learn kicking anywhere on cue. \n The mother's voice rhythm is repeated by the baby or can be used to stimulate feeding. \n Babies are leaning their native language before birth from 16 weeks gestation on. The proof \n is that they prefer looking at people using this language. \n Researchers discovered the presence of chemosensory receptors in utero. Many chemical \n compounds, including those from the mother's diet, pass through the placenta and reach the \n baby in utero while others flow in the capillaries of the nasal mucosa. By breathing and \n swallowing amniotic fluid, a baby becomes familiar with the mother's diet, including things \n like garlic. Even before post-nasal exposure to breast milk, babies already know and prefer \n their own mother's milk. They can smell it! Smell does not need air to spread! \n Traumatic events can happen at birth and stay with the child its entire life like the fear of \n adhesive tape if it is linked to pain or fear at the time of the birth. \n Unborn babies participate in their mother's emotional upset, especially when she is watching \n a movie. And babies whose mother experienced depression during pregnancy themselves \n display signs of depression at birth. \n All of this proves that memory and learning are a normal behavior of the unborn child and the \n human being. Education begins in the womb and continues in life. \n Being in the womb, the fetus is constantly stimulated by what is going on around it. The fetus is \n even more vulnerable because it grows billions of brain cells that are on their way to be \n programmed for future life outside the womb. \n We have to think that this growing organism is an individual with its own personality and its own \n hearing and feeling apparatus. \n Fetus and personality: \n After three months, babies show signs of personality; one fetus behaves differently from \n another in the womb, already showing if it will be active or not, how curious it is and how open to \n the world outside. \n Prenates choose the way they are lying in the womb and they \"decide\" the time of labor by \n releasing protein in the mother's blood stream. Many babies presenting in the breach position just \n before labor have been convinced by their mothers to turn and shift in a way it would facilitate \n birth for both of them, showing there is a real communication going on between parents and \n fetuses.\n There is evidence that babies share in their mothers' emotions via the hormones associated with \n them. For centuries many cultures have believed it, and for this reason were cautious to avoid the \n mother any unhappiness or discomfort as well as keeping her pure in body and mind. \n Prenatal researchers believe that there is indeed some connection between what a mother thinks \n and how her baby feels. \n Studies revealed a tendency for anxious mothers to produce anxious babies. \n Mothers who resent being pregnant or feel detached from their babies are more likely to have \n children who will have emotional problems. \n Some children whose mothers were depressed during pregnancy appear to be depressed \n themselves, rarely smiling, sobbing often or not feeding well. \n Preborns register not only the mother's emotions but the lilt of her voice and the pattern of her \n language and of those talking to her. \n Preborns may be leaning their native language before birth from 16 weeks on, so that by 27 \n weeks of gestation, the fetus' voice already contains some of the speech characteristics of its \n mother. [1] \n Preborns also use their memory actively. \n A study by Donald Shelter, professor of education at the University of Rochester's Eastman \n School of Music, shows that fetuses can remember wordless tunes, no matter how complex. [2] \n Certain children can even reproduce the tune if given a musical instrument, without errors and \n without being taught it before. \n Twins can be seen developing certain gestures and habits at twenty weeks gestational age which \n persist into their postnatal years, showing they are actively remembering. [1] \n In one case \"brother and sister were seen playing cheek-to-cheek on either side of the dividing \n membrane. At one year of age, their favorite game was to take positions on opposite sides of a \n curtain, and begin to laugh and giggle as they touched each other and played through the curtain.\" \n [3 ] \n Fetus and feelings: \n \n http://www.ummah.com/islam/taqwapalace/prenatal.pdf\n \n Here's an excerpt to another link that shows that fetuses dream, and much more.\n Science has shown us a lot about the fetus. Whoever deliberately commits abortion\n \n is subject to the penalty for homicide. Life Begins at conception, when the fetus is killed, its\n \n life is over. Religions fuel much of the intensity of the\n \n abortion debate. Twenty three weeks after conception, the fetus begins to\n \n dream. It would then go on\n \n to live a normal life. Basically , what has been written throughout this essay, implies that\n \n abortion is murder. When somebody is killed, a\n \n life has been lost. Therefore\n \n putting this together, I have come to the conclusion that ending the life of a\n \n fetus, is murder. There\n \n has never been a human with the same genetic code. Murder, is to put an end to a human beings life.\n \n Many laws have been enacted to protect the rights of the unborn, yet laws\n \n still protect abortion, an act that infringes upon the most sacred right of all,\n \n life.\n \n These groups feel pro-life because of passages from their holy texts.\n \n During the first trimester, a fetus is considered by most physicians to\n \n become sentient.\n http://www.megaessays.com/viewpaper/31362.html\n \n \n This link deals with fetal pain and evidence that it is evident in the unborn.\n  http://www.ampainsoc.org/pub/bulletin/jul03/article1.htm \n \n \nAs for my having a particular standard, everyone has a right to have their own standard and present their arguements for it. That is a large part of the reason that we are all here in this forum arguing our particular standards. I have as much right to argue for my standard as you have to argue for yours. Many people share my standard. However, the pro-choice group is more diverse than the pro-life group, so you will not find us all having the same standard.\n\n \n That's the problem with the natural man Ao, you all have moral and ethical standards that are based on your personal comfort zones but are never based in a higher good that goes beyond your own personal desires. Your complete values system is based on what feels right to your human, and very flawed perspectives.\n \n And there is nothing diverse at all about the pro-abortionists stance. You all insist that a baby isn't human until you can see it, or by some other arbitrary standard that is intended to justify abortions rather than actually face the truth of the value inherent within each unique unborn child. As an example, I will await your combined condemnation of this evidence I'm providing here. None of you will say hmmm, this demands that we reconsider our stance.

Reviews I have read by groups of scientists assembled to investigate issues such as fetal pain conclude that the cerebral cortex has to be developed enough to actually cause an experience of pain. Before that, fetuses can react, but it is reflex action - not something actually perceived. Many other actions caused by reflex actions or purely chemical means can also be misinterpreted, as seems to be the case for most of the first part of your post. I trust that the science can best determine the state of development necessary for pain, cognition, etc., and that the current scientific consensus is the correct one until and unless someone can come up with results that refute that consensus and still stand up to scrutiny. That doesn't seem to be the case.\n \nThat's the problem with the natural man Ao, you all have moral and ethical standards that are based on your personal comfort zones but are never based in a higher good that goes beyond your own personal desires. Your complete values system is based on what feels right to your human, and very flawed perspectives.\n\n If I only cared about my own good, then I would cheat, steal and otherwise hurt people in all situations that I could get away with, and otherwise cause whatever mayhem would benefit me. That is far from the case. Just because my morality is not based on religion doesn't mean that it is based on selfishness. My morality is based on taking a rational objective look at the world and coupling that rational analyis with a generally approach of trying to treat others as I would myself expect to be treated if I were in their shoes. Where abortion is concerned, by reciprocity, I think my mother should have had every right to abort me up to the time that I started to have a mental existence. Sure I am glad she did not, but I am also glad that she didn't use contraceptives, or anything else that would have stopped my coming into existence.\n \n The trouble with those who are strongly religious is that they often do not take a rational objective look at the world but automatically assume that whatever they are told is correct. Many might have good intentions, but if they don't view the world as it really is, then those good intentions might do more harm than good. Otherwise, many who are strongly religious proclaim certain moral rules without presenting all the rational reasons behind those rules.\n \nAnd there is nothing diverse at all about the pro-abortionists stance. You all insist that a baby isn't human until you can see it, or by some other arbitrary standard that is intended to justify abortions rather than actually face the truth of the value inherent within each unique unborn child.

Quoting a few passages:\n \nThis view is not widely accepted, however, and is rejected by Fitzgerald herself. Prior to 26 weeks, the thalamocortical fibers have not yet penetrated the cortical plate, and it seems unlikely the cortical structures considered necessary for pain are responding to noxious stimulation (Mrzljak, Uylings, Kostovic, & van Eden, 1988). \n\n \nPain experience is now widely seen as a consequence of an amalgam of cognition, sensation, and affective processes, commonly described under the rubric of the biopsychosocial model of pain. Pain is no longer regarded as merely a physical sensation of noxious stimulus and disease, but is seen as a conscious experience that may be modulated by mental, emotional, and sensory mechanisms with sensory and emotional components. The biopsychosocial concept emphasizes the multidimensional nature of illness, injury, and pain, rather than emphasizing pain as a purely physical fact of illness or injury. Pain has been described as a multidimensional phenomena for some time (Melzack & Casey, 1968), and this understanding is reflected in the current IASP definition of pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage\" (Merskey, 1991).\n \n If this 'multidimensionality' is the basis of conscious pain experience, it seems unlikely we can attribute this experience to the neonate or unborn fetus, which is naive to the cognitive, affective, and evaluative experiences necessary for pain awareness. This is accepted in the current definition of pain, which is further expanded to state, \"Pain is always subjective. Each individual learns the application of the word through experiences related to injury in early life.\" Pain does not, so to speak, spring forth from the depths of the person's mind prior to any experience, but is gradually formed as a consequence of general conscious development. \n \n Interestingly, even those authors who support a concept of fetal pain tend to back away when confronted with the need to explain pain phenomenology. Giannakoulopoulos et al (1994), for example, distanced themselves from any implied fetal pain experience with the statement, \"a hormonal response cannot be equated with the perception of pain.\" Lloyd-Thomas and Fitzgerald (1996) have suggested if feeling and pain are properly understood, the fetus cannot be said to feel pain. \n",

   "Interestingly enough, even your own web site supports much of my view. Quoting a few passages:\n\n \n So if my link say's something you agree with, it isn't so sketchy all of a sudden huh? Well it also say's this Ao.\n The New England Journal of Medicine ran an editorial calling on clinicians to &#8220;Do the right thing,&#8221; concluding, &#8220;it is our responsibility to treat pain in neonates and infants as effectively as we do in other patients&#8221; (Rogers, 1992). Since then, it has become normal practice to assume neonates feel pain, and this has inevitably led to speculation that the fetus may also experience pain (Anand & Hickey, 1987; Giannakoulopoulos, Sepulveda, Kourtis, Glover, & Fisk, 1994; Richards, 1985). Discussion of fetal pain has attracted the attention of the media and governments because of links to abortion practice (Derbyshire, 1999). This year, the Minnesota Senate enacted legislation requiring physicians to inform women of the possibility of fetal pain prior to performing abortions (Minnesota Senate Bill 187). This article evaluates the evidence for and against fetal and neonatal pain, considering the implications for current clinical practice (other than abortion), and the contemporary understanding of pain.Further support comes from the work of Fitzgerald (1987, 1994), who has reviewed the biological development of the fetus and examined the possibility of fetal pain at each stage of development. At 7.5 weeks&#8217; gestation, reflex responses to somatic stimuli begin, and touching the perioral region results in a contralateral bending of the head. The palms of the hands become sensitive to stroking at 10.5 weeks, and the rest of the body and hindlimbs become sensitive at approximately 13.5 weeks. Shortly after the development of sensitivity, repeated skin stimulation results in hyperexcitability and a generalized movement of all limbs. This hyperexcitability has been interpreted as evidence for the presence of a functional pain system, reflecting an immature but intact pain response with early hypersensitivity to stimulation (Barr, 1994). This view is not widely accepted, however, and is rejected by Fitzgerald herself.

Giannakoulopoulos et al. (1994) from the Queen Charlottes Hospital in London, England, successfully demonstrated intrauterine needling to obtain blood samples from fetuses at 20 to 34 weeks&#8217; gestation results in a hormonal stress response.

   "So if my link say's something you agree with, it isn't so sketchy all of a sudden huh? Well it also say's this Ao.\n\n The quotes that you showed in your first post on the subject - post #31 - were indeed all sketchy. The third link that you never quoted from until your most recent post does have a mixture of results. So, lets analyze some of them:The New England Journal of Medicine ran an editorial calling on clinicians to \"Do the right thing,\" concluding, \"it is our responsibility to treat pain in neonates and infants as effectively as we do in other patients\" (Rogers, 1992). Since then, it has become normal practice to assume neonates feel pain, and this has inevitably led to speculation that the fetus may also experience pain (Anand & Hickey, 1987; Giannakoulopoulos, Sepulveda, Kourtis, Glover, & Fisk, 1994; Richards, 1985). Discussion of fetal pain has attracted the attention of the media and governments because of links to abortion practice (Derbyshire, 1999). This year, the Minnesota Senate enacted legislation requiring physicians to inform women of the possibility of fetal pain prior to performing abortions (Minnesota Senate Bill 187). This article evaluates the evidence for and against fetal and neonatal pain, considering the implications for current clinical practice (other than abortion), and the contemporary understanding of pain.No one here is claiming that no fetuses experience pain. The question that science has been challenged to answer is when fetuses can first start experiencing pain. There, a concensus has generally formed that it is quite late in pregnancy - when cortical connections and the cerebral cortex is further developed. Even then, it is not certain whether pain can be felt before consciousness. As for media and politics, history has proven time and again that media and politics often act quite independently of any scientific evidence. The media and politicians are far from experts and far from being objective judges.Further support comes from the work of Fitzgerald (1987, 1994), who has reviewed the biological development of the fetus and examined the possibility of fetal pain at each stage of development. At 7.5 weeks' gestation, reflex responses to somatic stimuli begin, and touching the perioral region results in a contralateral bending of the head. The palms of the hands become sensitive to stroking at 10.5 weeks, and the rest of the body and hindlimbs become sensitive at approximately 13.5 weeks. Shortly after the development of sensitivity, repeated skin stimulation results in hyperexcitability and a generalized movement of all limbs. This hyperexcitability has been interpreted as evidence for the presence of a functional pain system, reflecting an immature but intact pain response with early hypersensitivity to stimulation (Barr, 1994). This view is not widely accepted, however, and is rejected by Fitzgerald herself. Prior to 26 weeks, the thalamocortical fibers have not yet penetrated the cortical plate, and it seems unlikely the cortical structures considered necessary for pain are responding to noxious stimulation (Mrzljak, Uylings, Kostovic, & van Eden, 1988).As can be seen by the bolded statements, the very person who conducted that research that you quote here rejects the theory that early fetuses can feel pain.The evidence for cortical involvement post-26 weeks is enhanced by behavioral studies that have demonstrated focused and organized responses to noxious stimulation that can be better discriminated from other distress responses (Craig, Whitfield, Grunau, Linton, & Hadjistavropoulos, 1993). As with the hormonal response to surgery, the behavioral responses can be reduced with the use of appropriate anesthetic (Fitzgerald, Millard, & McIntosh, 1989).\n \n Having established the necessary neurobiology for pain is in place and that behavioral responses to noxious stimulation are present in premature babies of approximately 26 weeks gestation, it is logical to suggest a fetus of at least 26 weeks' gestation will respond similarly to invasive practice as observed in neonates undergoing surgery.

They demonstrated that needling the innervated intraabdominal portion of the umbilical vein, rather than the placental cord (which is not innervated) resulted in increased cortisol and b-endorphin concentrations in fetal plasma. If this group or others can demonstrate the hormonal and neural \"stress response\" can be prevented with the use of appropriate anesthetics, they will have mirrored the criteria that have led to the widespread acceptance of \"neonatal pain.\"This shows hormonal reaction, which most scientists claim doesn't by itself show the experience of pain. Either way, this talks about post 26 week fetuses - i.e. the same late term fetuses that I do accept as having the possibility of having a mental existence. It does NOT speak of early term fetuses and embryos.\n \nLike any objective source, this link gives both sides of the issue. So your posting the other side does nothing to nullify the fact that evidence exists that fetuses feel pain at 26 weeks or even less possibly, according to the bolded info above.

For late term fetuses, the scientific community still seems undecided - some arguments for and some against. As I have always said, for late term fetuses, they might have mental existence (which includes the possibility of experiencing pain) so I would limit late term abortion rights. The abortions in question are for first trimester or early to mid second trimester abortions (anything prior to late second trimester). For that state of development, you have yet to show evidence that fetuses and embryos experience pain.",

Remember, YOU were the one who introduced that link. Do you no longer consider it reliable since it turns out to mainly argue against early fetal pain?\n \n As for this new link, it is from one individual's testimony before congress. It does not represent a consensus of scientists and does not address the arguements that most scientists have about the cerebral cortex needing to be involved (meaning that, with late development of the cerebral cortex, pain could only be felt in late pregnancy). Remember, just because some of the parts necessary for pain reception are there, that doesn't mean that everything is in place for the fetus to experience pain. \n \n Instead of listening to only one scientist's voice, who can pick and choose his prefered results depending on his biases, I put much more trust in conclusions reached by groups of scientists - where most such personal biases can be averaged out. There haven't been many organized groups of scientists or comprehensive reviews of scientific literature, but the ones that I have come across all seem to support fetal pain only in late pregnancy:\n \n Here is one from the Journal of the American Medical Association - http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/brownbag/brownbag0506/fetalpain.pdf \n They summarize:Evidence Acquisition Systematic search of PubMed for English-language articles focusing on human studies related to fetal pain, anesthesia, and analgesia. Included articles studied fetuses of less than 30 weeks&#8217; gestational age or specifically addressed fetal pain perception or nociception. Articles were reviewed for additional references. The search was performed without date limitations and was current as of June 6, 2005.\n Evidence Synthesis Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus. Neither withdrawal reflexes or hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures prove the existence of fetal pain, because they can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing. Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks&#8217; gestational age, while troencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks. For fetal surgery, women may receive general anesthesia and/or analgesics intended for placental transfer, and parenteral opioids may be administered to the fetus under direct or sonographic visualization. In these circumstances, administration of anesthesia and analgesia serves purposes unrelated to reduction of fetal pain, including inhibition of fetal movement, prevention of fetal hormonal stress responses, and induction of uterine atony.\n Conclusions Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester. Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques. Similarly, limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion. Anesthetic techniques currently used during fetal surgery are not directly applicable to abortion procedures.\n Another is from the British Medical Association (BMA), referencing, among other things, a full inquiry that was made by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The BMA concludes (from http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/AbortionTimeLimits~Factors~pain ):\n Interpretation of the evidence on fetal pain is conflicting, with some arguing that the fetus has the potential to experience pain at ten weeks&#8217; gestation, others arguing that this stage is not reached until 26 weeks&#8217; gestation (see below) and still others arguing for some unspecified gestational period in between, for example 17 weeks. It has been argued, however, that those who adopt a stage early in fetal development confuse the notion of pain &#8211; as an experience &#8211; with reflex or hormonal 'stress' responses. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, following a detailed review of the evidence, argued that there is no possibility of fetal awareness before 26 weeks:\n \n 'It is possible by direct means to identify the minimum stage of structural development that is necessary &#8211; but not that which is sufficient &#8211; to confer awareness upon the developing fetus. This minimum stage of development, with structural integration of peripheral nerves, spinal cord, brain stem, thalamus and, finally, the cerebral cortex, has not begun before 26 weeks&#8217; gestation.' \n \n Although debate continues about whether, and if so when, the fetus can experience pain, current mainstream professional guidance suggests that a fetus cannot begin to have the possibility of experiencing pain until after 26 weeks&#8217; gestation. This view is reflected in practical guidance on the use of analgesia during invasive procedures carried out on the fetus in utero. The BMA&#8217;s view is that even if there is no incontrovertible evidence that fetuses experience pain, the use of pain relief, when carrying out invasive procedures, may help to relieve the anxiety of the parents and of health professionals. \n Again, it is more important what the scientific community concludes than what an individual scientist claims, since you will never have ALL scientists agreeing on the subject. If you can find a link that shows the conclusion of such a consortium of scientists from a non-biased organization (i.e. not politically motivated or sponsored in either the pro-life or pro-choice sides), that also addresses the arguements that cortical connections are necessary, then it might be evidence worth exploring.",

That doesn't mean that they are always right. That is why one puts more trust in scientific consensus among a larger scientific community than one does in individual scientists. Individual scientists have their individual flaws of personal biases, egos, etc. When they come together as a group to argue the subjects, any such biases would be easily revealed under the scrutiny of debate. That is why scientific consensus is so much more trustworthy than the word of any one individual scientists. That is how science works. As for speaking in front of Congress, it is very clear that those who are chosen to speak in front of Congress are not only chosen for their qualifications but are also chosen because they support a particular political group's political agenda. I would therefore not choose speaking in front of congress as an objective criteria of the accuracy of the scientists view.\n \nNow I understand that no evidence has been absolutely proven since it's impossible to actually get inside of a fetus and determine what it feels with a critical mind. But based on the preponderance of the evidence regarding fetal responses to stimuli and including hormonal responses to it, and since some sources consider that valid evidence to consider, while some sources don't like the ones you post. It seems to me that when dealing with human beings and with legitimate questions with the evidence, that the benefit of the doubt should lean in favor of the child if our goal is to be fair and impartial. After all the welfare of the fetus is paramount, is it not?\n\n Depends on how much doubt there is. Some might even argue that a soul exists separately from the body starting from conception and that this soul might experience suffering due to abortion. Sure, one cannot be 100% sure that such a soul does not exist, so there is always some chance that even zygotes can suffer (if you include such supernatural explanations). However, we have no evidence for that whatsoever, so one cannot take that into account when determining laws. Laws need to be based on the preponderance of evidence and, given that the scientific consensus seems to be that only late term fetuses might experience pain, any law based on issues of fetal pain would have to limit itself to that late term. Once again, a scientific consensus does not mean that all scientists agree, just a clear majority. I suppose that you can say that almost all scientific theories have SOME doubt - it is all a matter of degree. Laws cannot be based on very dubious evidence.\n \n Personally, I go with the scientific consensus in determining the state of development of a fetus - including pain. The scientific consensus says that early term fetuses cannot experience pain. As for late term fetuses, there doesn't seem to be a consensus yet. So, as long as Science does not know, I am willing to give the fetus the benefit of the doubt and restrict abortion rights from the point in development (late term) when it MIGHT first experience mental existence or pain.",

Jan. 10-12, 2003. N=1,002 adults nationwide.

Only 10% thought that third trimester abortions should be generally legal. Assuming that 50% of the respondents were pro-choice, this means that at least 68% of pro-choice advocates also thought third trimester abortions should be generally illegal. Note: Interestingly, the poll also found that 66% of respondents thought that first trimester abortions should be generally legal - which would include a minority of pro-life proponents as well. It should also be noted that a few polls I had seen from earlier recent years show similar numbers - so these numbers seem to be pretty reliable.\n \n Why does such a majority of the pro-choice side want to limit abortion rights in the third trimester? Mainly, because we realize that the third trimester fetus is getting awfully close to having all the same characteristics as a born baby and the same sympathy we have for born babies start kicking in. In other words, at late term, one needs to consider two sets of rights (whether or not they are officially labelled at this point as rights) as opposed to one.

The same government that today may prohibit  abortion may in the future require it.\n \n There the law, for everyone's sake, dare not go.\n\n Here, you are taking the \"slippery slope\" arguement. The UK seems to have been successful in stabilizing the abortion contraversy by generally outlawing late term abortions. This eliminated the most compelling arguements of the pro-life side so that, nowadays, the number of people who would like to further decrease abortion rights is too small to make a lot of political difference. Or at least that is the impression I get from a few Brits who communicated on the subject. It makes political sense. Among other things, pictures of late term aborted fetuses draw sympathy. Pictures of aborted first trimester embryos / fetuses draw much less sympathy. By letting the law give in to the great majority view about late term abortions, you might well make abortion rights MORE safe for the future, not less safe. Indeed, even Roe vs Wade permits the state to limit late term abortions but, unfortunately, it isn't specific enough in its wording about the health exception.\n \n Meanwhile, you are ignoring the opposing arguement about fetal rights. What is it that you think about the fetus one day from birth? Is it just an object to you at that stage?

You've repeated this mantra several times now. What do you mean exactly? Are you saying you can't have an opinion regarding the issue of abortion just because you are a man? Or are you saying that men shouldn't be able to stop a given individual woman ending her pregnancy? On the first count, you're dead wrong. Anyone has the right to have an opinion on this. On the second you're technically correct, but only because of reality and biology--the woman happens to be the one carrying the baby. But there's no higher and greater worth that women have than men. Perhaps it makes you feel you are being chivalrous to take the approach you're taking, but men and women are equal. There's no greater worth one has over the other; it's not really about women having a 'right' than men don't; but rather simply a result of the reality that men the baby happens to be in the female's uterus.

   "First of all, you start with a faulty premise. Women in the late stages of their pregnancies do not wake up one morning and choose to end them.\n\n I brought this up as a hypothetical since it seems that your view of abortion rights would permit such an abortion. If I am wrong about you permitting such an abortion, then please state otherwise. If you would indeed permit such an abortion, then it is highly probably that you have not put any thought into the implications of killing a fetus that, for all intents and purposes, is pretty much the same as a born baby at that point - in all except location.\n \nAs to your other three questions, as a man, I am not entitled to an opinion, despite your emotionalism.\n\n This is illogical. The questions asked were \"What is it that you think about the fetus one day from birth? Is it just an object to you at that stage? Have you no sympathy for any fetus aborted one day from birth if the mother would just suddenly decide against it?\" Why do you think that you have no entitlement to answer those questions? If someone asked - when does a fetus's heart first start beating, would you answer \"I have no authority to answer that question since I am a man?\" That would be absurd. \n \n Lets narrow it down to one question then: \n Besides location, is there any difference between the fetus one day from birth and the newly born baby? This is an question of logic, not of emotion. \n \nThe choice is and must remain entirely in the hands of the pregnant woman.\n\n Claiming that is true doesn't make it true. If you cannot support your position by countering the arguements both from the pro-life side and from those of us on the majority of the pro-choice side that disagree with you, then they are wasted words.\n \nCounter queries: Are you willing to say to the hypothetical woman in the situation you describe, \"I will adopt your child and provide it with the love discipline, and money that is needed to see it becomes a productive member of society.\"?\n \n Are you willing to have the government mandate that you should do so?emoticon_xgood\n\n This is a logical falacy. When we support laws against people stealing, does that mean that we individually agree to support them since we are taking away their livelihood (ex. you supporting a particular thief since you supported laws against him stealing)? No. We are not personally responsible for the laws that we make.\n \n However, I will grant that, as a society, we are responsible for the consequences of the laws we make. There, I would support with taxes the upbringing of those third trimester fetuses that would otherwise be aborted but weren't based on more restrictive laws about third trimester abortions. Since the number of fetuses that are aborted in late term for illegitimate reasons (besides risk of mothers death, serious risk to health, major abnormalities, rape and incest...) is so tiny, it would barely make a dent in taxes anyway - especially since, given the current balance of adoption needs, many or most of those could be adopted out anyway. \n \n You might say, if there are so few of such cases anyway, why introduce a law? My answer would be the converse - i.e. what would it hurt to introduce a law if there are so few cases? It is largely a matter of the consequences. If you introduce such a law then you might well quiet down most of the contraversy about abortion rights - or at least reduce the numbers of opponents of abortion rights to a manageable minimum. If you leave the possibility of abortion at all stages, then the contraversy continues and we risk losing ALL abortion rights. I think that is a reasonable compromise to make in order to keep abortion rights safe.\n \n As a reminder again, I am pro-choice, supporting full rights to abortion in the first trimester and most if not all of the second trimester - when nearly all abortions are performed anyway. My view of fetal rights kicks in at the start of a potential mental existence - i.e. late term. It is only the infrequent cases of social abortions in late term for which we have a disagreement.",

   "Sorry, AO, but all I can do is repeat my former position, which you seem to not understand. I do not HAVE a position on \"abortion rights\". As a man, I am not entitled to an opinion on the issue.\n\n This continues to make no logical sense. Everyone is entitled to have an opinion on the issue. The only thing that I would imagine would be unjust for you to state as a man would be if you belittled the statements of difficulties of pregnancy, or adoption, or any other experience that only a pregnant woman can have. People who say \"I know better than you what you are experiencing\" are indeed royal pains in the neck and usually completely wrong. Outside of such statements, you certainly do have the right to make intellectual statements about state of development of the fetus. Since you are so adamant in refusing to answer such an intellectual question, I can only guess that you know full well that the nearly born fetus is, for all intents and purposes, the same as the newly born but you do not have the intellectual courage to accept this as a difficulty that you would have to argue away.\n \nMy position is as it has always been, that this is a choice that must needs be left to the pregnant woman alone.\n\n I fully understand your position. I simply disagree with it. When people disagree on a position, they debate it. It makes no sense for one person to argue by simply repeating their view over and over - at least not for adults. Debate means that each opponent needs to have arguements to respond to the arguments of the opponents. I have answered your points. You have largely ignored mine. I can only assume that you ignore them since you have no reasoned arguement to oppose them.\n \nThere are those who believe a person exists from conception, such as the RC Church, and there are others who believe there is no person present until birth., such as the US Census Bureau.\n \n Because of this, the law must, for its own sake, and for ours, remain silent.\n \n\n I don't see the logic behind this conclusion. Every legal issue has a wide range of popular opinion behind it. Should we not make any laws unless there is a unanimous popular opinion? That would be absurd. \n \nNow, try as you might to conflate the issue, that is not a position on abortion; it's a position on the law.\n\n This is a question of laws about abortion so both topics are relevant. Where laws are concerned, I would strongly stress that no laws can be made based on religious views (separation of church and state) and that laws have to be based on the reality that is revealed by the preponderance of evidence - not on guesses, biases, or wishful thinking. Also, laws cannot go against the Constitution. Even Roe vs Wade allowed the state to limit late term abortions - at least from the point of viability. \n \nIf you believe otherwise, please lay out just what sanction the law should take against a woman who chooses a late-term abortion. We all know that, in order for the government to ensure that its laws are obeyed, there must be a penalty for breaking it.\n ...\n Secondarily, you will need to consider the issue of whom the penalty should be exacted against - the woman, her physician, or both.\n \n Are you really willing to see either of them led to the execution chamber for this \"crime\"?\n\n Again, I believe that, when speaking of laws about abortion, then both topics are valid. As for consequences, I would look into the consequences used by other developed Western countries - ex. Britain, France, Germany, etc. - as well as taking other considerations into account. A quick search did not reveal how these countries handle abortion laws and I don't have time to search farther but that is part of the consideration. I don't know why you jump to conclusions that the only penalty is the death penalty. You DO realise, don't you, that there is a huge spectrum of penalties that exist - including fines or community work, not just jail time or the extreme case of the death penalty. I would also lean toward punishing the doctor more so than the woman.\n \nWhile you are pondering that issue, remind yourself, please, that there are many who consider abortion to be murder, and we also know that those same folks consider it to be the murder of the \"most innocent in society\". If that indeed be that case, any sanction short of the Death Penalty would seem to be highly inappropriate, wouldn't you say?\n\n I cannot speak for people whose opinions I do not share. Also, just because some might have extreme opinions does not mean that my own opinion needs to be extreme in the opposite direction in order to counter it. I am a moderate and my views reflect that.

I don't appreciate you trying to put words in my mouth.\n \n In late term, the fetus is that - a fetus. It is not a 'child\", nor a \"baby\", nor any pro-life term. However, it might have sentience/mental existence and, in my view and in the view of many if not most on the pro-choice side, that gives it some rights. However, those rights need to be balanced with the rights of the mother. This balance mainly leans on the side of the mother but doesn't give her absolute rights. For example, if there is a risk to the mother's life or significant risk to her health, then the mother's rights win out and she can abort the fetus, obviously resulting in its death. That is hardly an equal balance of rights. However, there could be rare cases when the mother, for example, just suddenly decides she doesn't want to have a baby after all and decides to abort the late term fetus - a social decision, not a medical one, etc. There, even with the general weighting toward the mother, the burden on the mother is much less than on the now sentient fetus, so the fetal rights win out. Alternatively, instead of looking at sentience, Roe vs Wade considers viability as the critical point at which the fetus needs to be considered and state restrictions can be applied. Since they roughly come out to the same timeframe, I am perfectly comfortable with Roe vs Wade - except for its vagueness on the outlines for state control in late term.\n \n Pregnancy is such a unique situation that one cannot make a complete comparison to the killing of a human in normal situations. Some differences include:\n 1) Though the fetus might get sentience and mental existence around the beginning of the third trimester, science cannot tell us for sure at what stage after this minimum it starts. So, it is uncertain whether or not it is yet a person (if you assume that person requires sentience). However, most of us would give it the benefit of the doubt.\n 2) In no other situation is another human as much of a burden on the body of another, challenging their bodily rights. So, there is some aspect of self-defense involved. However, as with regular self-defense, there are limits to what one can do. For example, one cannot kill someone who is about to punch your face.\n 3) The US hasn't fully explored the definition of personhood and when rights start. It seems to be accepted that born people are persons but there is still a lot of controversy about fetuses.\n \n These are just a few examples. This is not a clear cut issue that can be addressed with overly simplified arguements. So, one cannot just make a direct comparison to killing born people - there are just too many differences.\n \n ---\n \n Meanwhile, I am getting tired of answering your arguements while having you ignore most of mine. Unless you finally directly answer the question I asked you, I will no longer respond to your arguements. Fair is fair.\n \n The question was:\n Besides location, is there any difference between the fetus one day from birth and the newly born baby?",

   "This is always such a hot topic. I always find it interesting how many men seem to have more passionate views on the subject than women. As an adult female who survived the free love 70's without an abortion, not a church goer but a Truthseeker, mother of 2 grown delightful children, here's my take:\n \n - unless biology has changed drastically, it still requires a man and a woman to make a baby.\n \n - in this day and age with all of the birth control available, there is no excuse for unwanted pregnancies. There are thousands of childless couples seeking to adopt.\n \n - if a woman willfully engages in sex, she should be willing to bear the responsibility of carrying that child to term\n \n - if a woman is raped, she should be permitted to take the day after pill or have an early term abortion.\n \n -if a life-threatening medical condition develops for the mother due to the pregnancy, she should be allowed to abort.\n\n \n What about the women not educated about contraceptives? What about women who's contraceptive fails?\n \n There are too many variables to consider, and your post makes it sound like a black and white issue, when it's really not.",

There are a large number of surveys that support this. The web site http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm summarizes a wide range of polls on abortion. Just to name a few:\n \n The first one listed at this time, from Time Poll conducted by Abt SRBI. July 31-Aug. 4, 2008. N=808 likely voters nationwide. MoE \u00b1 3.: The question was:\n 'Which of these positions best represents your views about abortion? A woman should be able to get an abortion if she wants one in the first three months of pregnancy, no matter what the reason. Abortion should be legal ONLY in certain circumstances, such as when a woman's health is endangered or when the pregnancy results from rape or incest. Abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, even if the mother's life is in danger.\" \n Only 10% of US respondents said that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances. If 50% of US respondents are pro-life, that would mean that only 20% of all pro-life proponents would make abortion illegal in all circumstances.\n \n Quinnipiac University Poll. July 8-13, 2008. N=1,783 registered voters nationwide. MoE \u00b1 2.3. It asks: \"Do you think abortion should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases or illegal in all cases?\"\n From ten different polls asking the same question from May '04 through July '08, very consistently only 12-15% of respondents said that abortion should always be illegal. Again, if 50% of respondents are pro-life, that means that at most 30% of pro-life proponents think that abortion should be always illegal and the others disagree.\n \n Those are just the first two polls on the list. Every poll I looked at had similar trends - meaning that either all or the great majority of polls reveal the same thing. So, it is clear that all the statistics support my original statement that the terms you propose are already those accepted by the majority of pro-life proponents.",

However, as with my arguement about pro-life compromise, compromise of any sort means giving up cherished beliefs in order to reach a political settlement.

   "Anotheropinion:\n \n I accept your research, it's just from a \"laywoman\"s perception, it seemed to me that the Pro-Life position was no abortion under any circumstances (3rd trimester, partial birth) and opposed to stem cell research. I happily stand corrected in my perception, but I do believe the RC Church still opposes birth control and abortion, no matter what the circumstances. I saw pro-life support for abortion under critical circumstances as a \"step-forward\". I see no such \"step-forward\" from the pro-choice sector.\n\n Even if the RC church was against all abortion without exceptions (which I am not sure if that was their stance), then the polls still showed that most pro-life proponents did not support that stance. For a group to compromise, there needs to be change in a stance, no just a non-extreme stance to begin with. Similarly, there is a lot of variation in the pro-choice stance but that doesn't mean that pro-choice has already compromised. It just means that there is room to compromise from the current position since the original spread is wider. The future will tell which group is more willing to compromise.\n \nVery good. So I ask you, what exceptions has the pro-choice side made that shows that they are not COMPLETELY indifferent to the rights of the fetus?\n\n Among other things, Roe vs Wade allows for state interference in the last trimester - due to potential fetal viability. Also, polls show that 84% of Americans would limit abortion rights in the third trimester - which would include the majority of pro-choice supporters as well. That is from a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll from 2003 that one can find at that same pollingreport.com link.",

   "Anotheropinion:\n \n I guess I'm confused. What part of what I have posed as a solution do you deem inequitable and why?\n\n The time frame and the limited number of exceptions. \n \n For you, fetal rights seem to kick in at conception and dominate over any right a woman has to her body, except in extreme cases of rape or risk of mother's death. You would permit no other abortions at any stage of pregnancy.\n \n For the pro-choice side, a woman's right over her own body is very important. So, life itself is not enough to warrant the fetus having any rights. Potential is also important but not nearly as important as a woman's right to her own body. For a minority on the pro-choice side, such as chester, a woman's right to her own body outweighs any other consideration. For most of us on the pro-choice side, the only thing that starts outweighing in value the woman's right to her own body is when the fetus gets developed enough that it has the most critical aspects which we value in an aknowledged person. In my view and in the view of many others, this critical characteristic is mental existence. I don't view myself as having existed until I did so mentally, so my developing body did not deserve rights until there was \"somebody home\" in that body. A mental existence cannot start before around the third trimester, so I would allow full abortion rights until then and restricted abortion afterwards. Even then, I would add a few more exceptions - including significant risk to mother's health, and \"mercy killing\" if the fetus is severely deformed, etc. Meanwhile, others, including the justices deciding Roe vs Wade, find viability as the critical point when the state can interfere with the woman's right to her own body.\n \n Either way, our main differences lie in when we view the fetus as gaining rights and how much relative importance we put to fetal rights vs rights of a woman to her own body. A lot of these differences seem to be unresolveable. However, one step that I and likely most pro-choice supporters would be willing to make is to clarify restrictions on late term abortions. Some of the main impediments to this process is that the pro-life side would apparently like to slip in wording into any such proposal to allow for a slippery legal slope to outlaw all abortions.",

   "It was up for votes prior to 1973. It was at least a legitimate way to do things. The idea that one would remove a subject from the democratic debate for the sole reason that they don't want it to be there is not a good stance to have.\n\n I am simply saying that, as a pro-choice advocate, I would not be the one pushing for such a vote. If the pro-life side would want such a vote, then they have to push for it. However, the legitimate way of pushing for such a vote would require that they be willing to abide by the results - which is something I do not think the pro-life crowd would be ready to do since most Americans would support first trimester abortion rights.\n \n and there are legitimate ways and not legitimate ways. Getting a court to do your dirty work is without a doubt the wrong way and a dangerous way. \n\n The US Supreme court is there to uphold constitutional rights. Those rights are there to protect our rights from the swings of public opinion, where the public is not necessarily educated on certain subjects. I, for one, am certainly happy that we have this buffer to pure democracy and that one would need a substantial majority to overcome any constitutional ammendment. As for interpretation of the constitution and which interpretations are legitimate, that is too long a subject to get into here...\n \nI have no doubt the same question is consistent over the years but they still are inconsistent in terms of asking a question a different way. Furthermore, I don't define what is right based on public opinion polls.\n\n I do not claim that opinion polls show what is right. However, if they are detailed enough, they do give a good impression of how most Americans feel on a wide range of subjects. In a Democracy, ultimately we might end up having to abide by that majority opinion, even if it doesn't fit in with our particular value system.\n \nI'm not sure what you are referring to here but I'm not really sure it matters either.\n My point is that I suspect people don't really have a consistent view. If you show them a picture of a 2 month old fetus and say \"would you allow abortion when the baby looks like this?\" You'd probably get a response by 50-55% saying no (pure guess by the way). Would you not agree? \n \n I have no proof of this but judging from the polls I've seen people seem to think that abortion for \"birth control\" is no good. \n\n I have seen quite a few posts where people think very ill of abortion while simultaneously supporting abortion rights. So, what one thinks about abortion and how that translates into their expectations in law are two different things. Where polls are concerned, one has to get a feel for the trends and structure the poll based on those trends. Trends show that state of development does matter in peoples minds. Trends show that certain exceptions (ex. rape or risk of death) are almost universally accepted whereas others (ex. risk to mental health) are less so. Trends may show that most people would not view abortion as moral but, simultaneously, may not expect their sense of morality about abortion to be imposed by law. Polls need to therefore be structured based on a full intelligent analysis that takes all these trends into account, not purely to get a desired result by manipulating wording. That may be a tall order, but it seems that some polls are more successfull than others in acheiving this.\n \nYou can't. People know nothing about the stage of development at certain weeks...I certainly can't ramble it off at the top of my head. \n\n Then you are saying that there is no poll that you can think of that would address the question of the importance of fetal development on people's opinions about abortion. In any arguement of majority opinion having its say, then I would think that this development-dependence is such a critical issue that one would have to find some way of finding out public opinion. Meanwhile, unless some other poll comes out with better wording, I find the poll that I quoted, imperfect as it may be, still quite revealing about public opinion on the subject of fetal development and abortion rights.\n \nMy point is that the question about abortion never seems to come down to the basic question of when do we value human life when asked in a poll.

It is mostly sound bites from either side. In a full intelligent debate, the pro-life side might present such pictures but the pro-choice side would counter that, for early to mid-term, our gut reactions are not based on reality since there is \"nobody home\" yet in those bodies that people wrongly assume suffer based on seeing those photos. The debate could also bring up the issue of potential, or why it is that we protect human life to begin with, or when rights should start, etc. There are many subjects that could be reasonably debated in the public media but, instead, mainly reside in forums such as this.",

   "This is fine, but I feel the Supreme Court took this issue away from the people where it had been for so long. To do so was illegitimate.\n\n It is interesting to note that abortion was largely legal for more of American history than it was illegal. Indeed, it was largely legal (up to \"quickening') during our founding up through the late 19th century. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States#Abortion_before_Roe:There were few laws on abortion in the United States at the time of independence, except the common law adopted from England, which held abortion to be legally acceptable if occurring before quickening. \n ...\n Various anti-abortion statutes began to appear in the 1820s. In 1821, Connecticut passed a statute targeting apothecaries who sold poisons to women for purposes of abortion, and New York made post-quickening abortions a felony and pre-quickening abortions a misdemeanor eight years later. \n ...\n The criminalization movement accelerated during the 1860s, and by 1900 abortion was largely illegal in every state. Some states did include provisions allowing for abortion in limited circumstances, generally to protect the woman's life or pregnancies due to rape or incest. Abortions continued to occur, however, and increasingly became readily available. Illegal abortions were often unsafe, sometimes resulting in death, as in the case of Gerri Santoro of Connecticut in 1964.\nIndeed, which is why I stated above you should have a vote on these things...otherwise you say the minority is above the majority...which makes no sense. \n\n Does that mean that the pro-life side would be willing to keep first trimester abortions legal (the natural result of a vote where 66% believe first trimester abortions should be legal) and not try to circumvent public opinion? I find that hard to believe.\n \nWhich is beyond me...seems crazy.\n\n Why is it so crazy for people to hold opinions while accepting that others might have other views? Not everyone expects others to bend to their will.\n \nI wouldn't go that far...or rather go any farther. I'm sure development does matter to a lot, but what part of develop cannot be known from the polls. It may just be that people feel it should \"look like a person\" or perhaps have eyes or have a brain....you really only know that at 3months 1 day people feel the baby has developed to a point to get rights. \n\n The poll didn't address WHY people thought later pregnancy was more significant than early pregnancy when it came to fetal rights. Nevertheless, it is quite significant that the poll consistently showed that fetal development DOES matter. Given the trends in Europe where most Western developed countries set abortion limits somewhere between end of first trimester and end of second trimester (see http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6235557.stm ), this shows that such a fetal development-dependent stance is quite common.\n \n \nI'm sure you could but it would be very complicated and I doubt very much someone would do it. I suppose you could interview 1,000 people and say \"when exactly do you think abortion should not be allowed and why?\" and then get specifics such as \"oh well when you can see its eyes\" or something. Even then, you could show pictures of different stages of development and might get a different answer. That actually might be interesting. Show a picture of each week with a brief explanation of what characteristics exist at that time (known) and say when does this human get a right to live (assuming the respondent said development). \n\n Taking a poll is different than trying to educate the public. The poll needs to be stated as neutrally as possible. Otherwise, the poll would be biased if it purposely pulled on the emotions one way or the other. If someone answers on a poll based on emotions, it should be based on emotions that ALREADY exist, not on emotions that you stir with the poll question. The pro-choice side could just as easily present the suffering of poor women that cannot support a family, or that are too young, etc. Emotions can be stirred in either direction, which is why polls need to remain neutral where the stirring of emotion is concerned. If you just showed photos of embryos, for example, then, in order to have balance, then one would have to explain that there is no mental existence in those early fetuses - they are just bodies. Balance - that is critical in polls and it is most easily acheived by presenting the question in as neutral a way as possible. \n \n Either way, I agree the question of importance of fetal development would be tricky to phrase perfectly in a poll. Nevertheless, it seems obvious that the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll from 2003 that I quoted (along with its earlier identical polls) show that fetal development DOES matter. The reasons why it matters is an important but secondary question to the fact that fetal development does matter.\n \nand, of course, the nobody home argument could be countered by saying it would be the same as a 40yr brain damaged guy who would without a doubt recover and regain consciousness. The point of this is that at least you would have educated people on the subject.\n\n I haven't heard of a case where someone completely lost function of their cerebral cortex and then it just recovered. All cases I have heard of were of people who may have lost much of its function and then regained some. People who are in coma still have some cerebral cortex function. They are just not conscious and any mental existence that exists is quite minimal but still there.",

I think both of our sides, in general, abide by laws that are made by the majority. However, that does not mean that either of our sides thinks that the majority is always right.

However, my main point is that it would be hypocritical for a group to say that the right thing to do is for the majority to decide, and then reverse their opinion on majority rule if majority rules against them.

If pro-lifers are anti-abortion then choicers are pro-abortion. Bias has nothing to do with it.\n\n Jumping in to answer this, I have a few arguments against this point.\n \n First, any group likes to portray themselves based on what they value. In the pro-life case, you value human life (independent of whether there is \"somebody home\" in that living human body) so you call yourselves pro-life. Pro-choicers value a woman's choice in how her body is treated, so we call ourselves pro-choice.\n \n To score political points, opponents sometimes prefer calling a group by the negatives which they view. However, if you are going to rename a group based on what you view as negative, then you have to be accurate. Otherwise, it is simply a lie. From that point of view, the labelling of pro-life advocates as anti-choice is accurate and truthful since pro-life proponents indeed deny a woman a choice of whether to have an abortion. However, the labelling of pro-choice advocates as pro-abortion is innacurate and false since, in my experience, I have never heard of any pro-choice proponent advocating that any woman SHOULD get an abortion. Indeed, most pro-choice proponents would also hope that the number of abortions performed reduces with time but, critically, we would hope that this would be accomplished by fewer women choosing abortion (due to fewer unwanted pregnancies to begin with, or due to better socio-economic conditions letting them keep the baby, etc.). The more accurate renaming would be \"pro-abortion rights\". At least that would be accurate and truthful. Alternatively, one could call us \"anti-embryo rights\" if you want something that sounds negative to some portion of the population.\n \n If you think that pro-choice proponents are pro-abortion, meaning that they think that women SHOULD get abortions, then I challenge you to find a quote from a major poster here that suggests that.",

If someone supports the government's rights to tax their citizens, does that mean they are \"pro-tax\"? If one chooses the lesser of two evils, does that mean one is pro-that second lesser evil? No.\n \n Sometimes there are unfortunate necessities that one would prefer to avoid but that are better than the alternative - the lesser of two evils. Abortion is just such a thing. One would prefer to avoid having abortions, but sometimes the situation requires it. Pro-choice proponents simply view that, in the great majority of cases, the woman is in the best position to decide - especially since it is HER body that we are talking about.\n \n I don't know of any pro-choice proponents who go around saying \"Oh, what a great thing abortion is..\". Pro-choice proponents are certainly not driven by any love of abortion. They are driven by the fear of the alternative - that women with unwanted pregnancies are forced to carry those pregnancies against their will, leading to a wide range of problems both for her personally and for society in general. Similarly, though some on the pro-choice side might disagree, it seems that most pro-life proponents are not driven by glee at seeing women carrying a pregnancy against their will, they are largely driven by the repulsion and sympathy at seeing embryos and fetuses that they value aborted.\n \n If one doesn't even try to understand the opposition, then one will never get through to them. At least try to understand where the pro-choice side is coming from. Otherwise, your arguements will never hit home.",

So, one can blame a person for supporting a bad candidate since they did have that third choice of not voting at all. That is not the case when the only choices are between two bad things, as they are with abortion. \n \n The world is not designed to only give us choices between good (or neutral) and bad. That is why your absolutist position is too simplistic. Lets take the life-boat scenario - i.e. too many people on a life boat, not enough supplies, no way to call for help. You will all very likely die if you keep everyone on the boat but you have a good chance of surviving if several people leave. No one volunteers to sacrifice themselves. What do you do? There are no GOOD solutions. There are only BAD solutions - (a) force some people to leave by group vote or drawing straws against some peoples will, (b) take your chances to keep everyone, in which case probably everyone dies. Nevertheless, one needs to DO something. One cannot just not decide, as in the case of not voting for a candidate.\n \n My main point is that your example of the candidate is not one of choosing the lesser of two evils since there is a third choice of not voting. That is not the case with abortion rights. A woman either carries a child against her will or she aborts it. There is no third alternative that carries no negative consequences, as there is in your candidate example. We on the pro-choice side are certainly not making the decision for her. We are not saying that she should get an abortion. We simply think that she is the best one to decide. \n \n I guess in your black and white view of the world, this concept is hard to understand. I am curious, though, with this absolutist world view, how you would solve that life-boat scenario. What solution would you propose?\n \nA fetus is either alive, or it isn't. Regardless of what stage of development, the fetus is not capable of exercising a will of its own. \n\n Of course the fetus is not capable of exercising a will of its own if there is no mental existence. A rock also cannot exercise a will of its own for the same reason. At least that is true for early term fetuses and embryos. For late term fetuses, then I would agree with your general sentiment since a will might exist (not intellectually but from a negative mental reaction to getting aborted) but cannot be expressed. If there is no mental existence (as in early fetuses and embryos), then your point is moot.",

She might have to take a couple of weeks off from work? I'm afraid I don't see bringing life into this world as a bad thing.\n\n You completely trivialize the difficulties that are faced by women with unwanted pregnancies. It is precisely this type of attitude that drives the more extreme pro-choice views. \n \n To name only a few difficulties:\n 1) Pregnancy itself is very difficult on the body. Sometimes leading to major permanent health problems.\n 2) There is the shame and social harrasment in many communities of carrying an unwanted pregnancy. In many cases, this shame can prevent them from ever having a reasonably good life. \n 3) Giving a child up for adoption carries a lot of guilt in most situations and also carries a social / societal stigma. Though many people are supportive, most still find it hard to imagine how a woman can give a child up for adoption and this attitude fosters a life-long guilt on many women who give children up for adoption.\n 4) Keeping the child often can destroy all chances at a better life - chances for education for getting out of poverty, etc. This is not only negative for the woman herself but for any family she might have. If she waited until she was ready to have children, then she would do a much better job of it and the family's life would be much better.\n \n These are just a few examples. There are many, many reasons why women get abortions. \n \nYour lifeboat analogy is a poor one as well. If \"too many\" people managed to fit in the lifeboat, then they should all pray together to be rescued. No one should FORCE anyone else off the boat. That is the only BAD choice. No one on the boat has a crystal ball as to whether they will be rescued in an hour, a day or never. They made it to the boat, they should take their chances together.\n\n I thought you would take this tact. Remember, God helps those who help themselves. This life boat scenario was brought up during my teenage years in a Roman Catholic group mentoring to prepare us for Confirmation (when I was still regularly practicing religion). Of course, some one brought up this solution but it was viewed negatively by the Roman Catholic mentors since one cannot always cop out and rely on God through prayer. God will not always be around to save you so you have to try to take action on your own as well. If you think otherwise, then your religious views seem more similar to the fatalistic views that many Muslims hold. Too many of them don't take action because they think that whatever happens is God's will so that actions on their part won't help. That seems to be your position. Or am I wrong?\n \nA rock? You are comparing a developing baby with a rock? Are rocks ALIVE??? No, I didn't think so.\n\n I only compared an early fetus to a rock from the characteristic of how much mental existence it has prior to roughly the third trimester - in other words, none, just as in rocks. That was the specific characteristic we were discussing which is why I brought up that example. Obviously, other characteristics are far different - the early fetus is alive, it has human DNA, and, most importantly, it has the potential to become someone whose life we value.",

So rather than allow that he goes to the bottom of it and snips the flesh with surgical scissors increasing the size for the baby to come through. Once the baby is delivered, the doctor sews up the part he cut and it heals over the next few of weeks. The cost is included in the price of the birth. The dr doesn't stop midway through the birth and start negotiating a price with the woman who is by this time, mere minutes away from giving birth and deep in the throes of labor.",

You're right, I guess I don't know what it's like to be stupid and irresponsible.\n\n \n Birth control is not 100% effective. I believe another poster here, jitobear, used a pill and her partner used a condom and still she got pregnant (at least thats what I think she posted in a much earlier debate).

Her husband is a gravedigger and she cleaned houses. They really couldn't afford a 4th child. Yet somehow, she got pregnant with a 4th. That 4th child has since gotten married and produced a beautiful grandchild.\n\n \n That's one case of it going well. What about those unwanted children who become rapists and murderers?\n \n And thank you for calling me immature. You seem really good at cheap shots.",

   "Something else that should be considered is the history of the modern abortion movement, and especially PP's founder Margaret Sanger. She, like Adolf Hitler, was a racist and supporter of eugenics.\n\n \n Heaven forbid the pro-death abortionists should face up to their actual history of this racist and genocidal movement Bassman. Here is the foundation upon which Planned Parenthood was built. Now just watch shooter deny reality and attempt to defend against this documented history of what he supports so staunchly and easily. Here's page 1 of this disgusting history of what this racist woman and Planned Parenthood represents. \n (This article first appeared in the January 20, 1992 edition of Citizen magazine)\n \n How Planned Parenthood Duped America\n \n At a March 1925 international birth control gathering in New York City, a speaker warned of the menace posed by the \"black\" and \"yellow\" peril. The man was not a Nazi or Klansman; he was Dr. S. Adolphus Knopf, a member of Margaret Sanger's American Birth Control League (ABCL), which along with other groups eventually became known as Planned Parenthood.\n \n Sanger's other colleagues included avowed and sophisticated racists. One, Lothrop Stoddard, was a Harvard graduate and the author of The Rising Tide of Color against White Supremacy. Stoddard was something of a Nazi enthusiast who described the eugenic practices of the Third Reich as \"scientific\" and \"humanitarian.\" And Dr. Harry Laughlin, another Sanger associate and board member for her group, spoke of purifying America's human \"breeding stock\" and purging America's \"bad strains.\" These \"strains\" included the \"shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of antisocial whites of the South.\"\n \n Not to be outdone by her followers, Margaret Sanger spoke of sterilizing those she designated as \"unfit,\" a plan she said would be the \"salvation of American civilization.: And she also spike of those who were \"irresponsible and reckless,\" among whom she included those \" whose religious scruples prevent their exercising control over their numbers.\" She further contended that \"there is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped.\" That many Americans of African origin constituted a segment of Sanger considered \"unfit\" cannot be easily refuted.\n \n While Planned Parenthood's current apologists try to place some distance between the eugenics and birth control movements, history definitively says otherwise. The eugenic theme figured prominently in the Birth Control Review, which Sanger founded in 1917. She published such articles as \"Some Moral Aspects of Eugenics\" (June 1920), \"The Eugenic Conscience\" (February 1921), \"The purpose of Eugenics\" (December 1924), \"Birth Control and Positive Eugenics\" (July 1925), \"Birth Control: The True Eugenics\" (August 1928), and many others.\n \n These eugenic and racial origins are hardly what most people associate with the modern Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), which gave its Margaret Sanger award to the late Dr. Martin Luther King in 1966, and whose current president, Faye Wattleton, is black, a former nurse, and attractive.\n \n Though once a social pariah group, routinely castigated by religious and government leaders, the PPFA is now an established, high-profile, well-funded organization with ample organizational and ideological support in high places of American society and government. Its statistics are accepted by major media and public health officials as \"gospel\"; its full-page ads appear in major newspapers; its spokespeople are called upon to give authoritative analyses of what America's family policies should be and to prescribe official answers that congressmen, state legislator and Supreme Court justiices all accept as \"social orthodoxy.\"\n \n Blaming Families\n \n Sanger's obsession with eugenics can be traced back to her own family. One of 11 children, she wrote in the autobiographical book, My Fight for Birth Control, that \"I associated poverty, toil, unemployment, drunkenness, cruelty, quarreling, fighting, debts, jails with large families.\" Just as important was the impression in her childhood of an inferior family status, exacerbated by the iconoclastic, \"free-thinking\" views of her father, whose \"anti-Catholic attitudes did not make for his popularity\" in a predominantly Irish community.\n \n The fact that the wealthy families in her hometown of Corning, N.Y., had relatively few children, Sanger took as prima facie evidence of the impoverishing effect of larger families. The personal impact of this belief was heightened 1899, at the age of 48. Sanger was convinced that the \"ordeals of motherhood\" had caused the death of her mother. The lingering consumption (tuberculosis) that took her mother's life visited Sanger at the birth of her own first child on Nov. 18, 1905. The diagnosis forced her to seek refuge in the Adirondacks to strengthen her for the impending birth. Despite the precautions, the birth of baby Grant was \"agonizing,\" the mere memory of which Sanger described as \"mental torture\" more than 25 years later. She once described the experience as a factor \"to be reckoned with\" in her zealous campaign for birth control.\n \n From the beginning, Sanger advocacy of sex education reflected her interest in population control and birth prevention among the \"unfit.\" Her first handbook, published for adolescents in 1915 and entitled, What Every Boy and Girl Should Know, featured a jarring afterword:\n \n It is a vicious cycle; ignorance breeds poverty and poverty breeds ignorance. There is only one cure for both, and that is to stoop breeding these things. Stop bringing to birth children whose inheritance cannot be one of health or intelligence. Stop bringing into the world children whose parents cannot provide for them.\n \n To Sanger, the ebbing away of moral and religious codes over sexual conduct was a natural consequence of the worthlessness of such codes in the individual's search for self-fulfillment. \"Instead of laying down hard and fast rules of sexual conduct,\" Sanger wrote in her 1922 book Pivot of Civilization, \"sex can be rendered effective and valuable only as it meets and satisfies the interests and demands of the pupil himself.\" Her attitude is appropriately described as libertinism, but sex knowledge was not the same as individual liberty, as her writings on procreation emphasized.\n \n The second edition of Sanger's life story, An Autobiography, appeared in 1938. There Sanger described her first cross-country lecture tour in 1916. Her standard speech asserted seven conditions of life that \"mandated\" the use of birth control: the third was \"when parents, though normal, had subnormal children\"; the fourth, \"when husband and wife were adolescent\"; the fifth, \"when the earning capacity of the father was inadequate.\" No right existed to exercise sex knowledge to advance procreation. Sanger described the fact that \"anyone, no matter how ignorant, how diseased mentally or physically, how lacking in all knowledge of children, seemed to consider he or she had the right to become a parent.\"\n \n Religious Bigotry\n \n In the 1910's and 1920's, the entire social order-religion, law, politics, medicine, and the media-was arrayed against the idea and practice of birth control. This opposition began in 1873 when an overwhelmingly Protestant Congress passed, and a Protestant president signed into law, a bill that became known as the Comstock Law, named after its main proponent, Anthony Comstock. The U.S. Congress classified obscene writing, along with drugs, and devices and articles that prevented conception or caused abortion, under the same net of criminality and forbade their importation or mailing.\n \n Sanger set out to have such legislation abolished or amended. Her initial efforts were directed at the Congress with the opening of a Washington, D.C., office of her American Birth Control League in 1926. Sanger wanted to amend section 211 of the U.S. criminal code to allow the interstate shipment and mailing of contraceptives among physicians, druggists and drug manufacturers.http://www.blackgenocide.org/sanger.html",

A religious nut claimed my morality was broken.\n \n \nI was raised by Jewish parents, married a lapsed Catholic and have raised our children as \"truthseekers\" - providing them with the Old and the New Testaments, but belonging to no formal church or temple.\n\n \n That's great, however what if your children decide not to become christian? Buddhist maybe? \n \n \nYou think it's okay for a fascist regime to dictate how many children a family can have, \"for the sake of the planet\".\n\n \n And you want to take away woman's right to her body because of a clump of growing cells in her uterus.\n \n \n \n \n \nI suppose it's also okay with you for a fascist government to tell those children that are lucky enough to be born what they can read, what they can say and what they should believe in order for them to be \"happy\".\n\n \n Where did I say they should believe in something? This is like saying the government is telling children that theft is wrong, and some nut claiming that they are dictating how to think in order to be happy. Doesn't hold up.\n \n \n \nA government seeking to control a married couple's God given RIGHT to \"go forth and multiply\"\n\n \n \"Truth seeker\", eh?\n \n Don't I remember something in our constitution about separation of church and state?\n \n \n \nis anti-religion. Our country was founded on our \"inalienable rights as granted by our Creator\" to \"LIFE, liberty and pursuit of happiness\". If you've got a problem with that, go live in Venezuela, Cuba or China and see how successful you are at achieving happiness in a communist country.\n\n \n \n So you have the right to have 6 children, and all of our tax dollars should be used to educate them instead of doing something productive like maybe feeding the poor. Those six children have the right to take away another child's God given RIGHT to have clean air clean water, have enough food to eat, and to live a good life. Will more and more people cramming into this planet's limited space, it will not be able to feed everyone, our natural resources will run out, and it will eventually turn into a Sh** hole of pollution and waste.\n \n What makes you think you can take away my God given RIGHT to a clean place to live, and enough money to feed my future children? What about their rights? The 6 children families taking up all of our natural resources? Wheres my rights? Wheres my grand children's rights?\n \n Your arguments are pretty sick.\n \n 6 children families may have been OK 100 years ago, but they are not now. Condoms are free.\n \n \nYou should be ashamed of yourself, seriously.\n\n \n You fail to consider the rights of the rest of the world and will force women to carry fetuses in their uterus and I should be ashamed of myself?\n \n Tell you and your Islamist and Fundie Christian friends that If they want to have 6+ children, they should be fruitful in someone else's country.\n \nYou are the hypocrite, demanding for American women the \"right to choose\" to abort on the one hand,\n\n \n I believe in the basic human right to ones body, while you cannot grasp that concept.\n \n \nand condoning communist governmental sterilization\n\n \n You know that the other person's argument has failed when they erect strawmen and call you a communist.

   "Though I haven't been really following this latest interchange in any detail (I generally stop listening once conversations turn to mutual flaming), I did notice a couple of tangential issues come up that are worth addressing.\n \n One is the single child policy in China. I had a chance to travel to China in 2006 and this issue came up in conversation. As I understand it, women who get pregnant while already having a child are not directly forced to get an abortion. However, there are large fines associated with having more than one child and the second child is discriminated against by the system - in school, etc. So, the difficulties associated with having more than one child effectively forces most families to opt for abortion. I have mixed feelings about the one child policy. I would love families to be able to have full choice about their reproductive rights. However, I can see that, on a societal level, the overpopulation that would result in China would have many bad reprecusions. According to their statistics, the one child policy has resulted in a population that is 300 to 400 million people smaller than it would have been if this policy had not been put into place. Chinese have traditionally had large families since children were expected to support their parents in old age. Because of this expectation of support, there has been an unintended consequence of the one child policy where female fetuses have been disproportionally aborted compared to male fetuses since sons are thought, usually accurately, to be better providers for aging parents than daughters (except if daughters marry rich or have good careers of their own). The country does not have a social security system as we do. People have to largely fend for themselves. So, it is not an easy situation there with no easy answers.\n \n As for communism, my folks immigrated to the US from communist Poland in the 60s so I have had fairly direct feedback about communist systems, as they had turned out in reality. Though the poorest of the poor might find some benefit in communist systems, the great majority of upper lower class, middle class, and rich certainly live better lives under the restrained forms of Capitalism prevalent in the West. I would think that the main problems with Communism are that the system fails to give people incentives to work hard since you get the same salary and career benefits whether you are a slacker or a hard worker - inspiring most people to be slackers. Also, there seems to be a lack of what I would call \"corruption control mechanisms\". Essentially, there was little if any accountability for failed programs - only political accountability for criticising the wrong person or even criticising the system in general. That is a recipe for corrupt oligarchies and essentially fascist systems.\n \n However, many conservatives seem to equate the social democracies that one finds in modern day Europe with communism, which is absurd. Countries such as Sweden are democracies but much of their industry is state owned and the state has more control over the practices of industry. The average salaries are quite high, and people apparently do feel a sense of freedom just as we do. I have heard that, compared to the US, whether or not such a system is beneficial depends on your socio-economic standing. The taxes are high but you get a lot of benefits from those taxes - safety nets, social programs, etc. There is a smaller spread in salaries - which tends to benefit the poorer to central middle class. However, it is not as beneficial a place to live if one is ambitious or has an entreprenereal spirit. I knew a successful Swedish engineer who stayed in the US after graduate schoold for precisely the reason that he knew that, at his level, he could be more successful in the US. So, social democracies have both advantages and disadvantages.\n \n Anyway, those are a few thoughts on some of the issues brought up here. Rarely can one put one line answers to issues and be accurate. Even these paragraphs are simplifications of the real situation. I just decided to include these to demonstrate that sound-byte answers are just not suited to reality - which is almost always much more complex.",

However, it largely failed because its system for alleviating those concerns was seriously flawed and also because capitalism itself changed to be more constrained (8 hour work day, better working conditions, etc.). \n \n\n \n I would just point out to you that each and every one of the reforms you discuss and Social Security and Workers' Compensation statutes, and Workplace Safety Regulations and pensions and much else were brought about by people against who the supposed epithet \"Communist\" was hurled.\n \n Capitalism did not bring about these changes on its own. Had the ownership class of the past, or of today for that matter, had its way, none of this would have occurred.\n \n The only thing lacking is social ownership of the means of production.",

Had the ownership class of the past, or of today for that matter, had its way, none of this would have occurred.\n \n The only thing lacking is social ownership of the means of production.\n\n I agree with you that socialism of the 30s did help influence many of these beneficial changes to Capitalism. As I have understood it from my limited reading of history, it was fear of a full change to socialism that made the elites give in to the most critical changes needed to make capitalism palatable to the masses of poor workers - where many of these changes were socialist ideas. Indeed, there was a similar trend in the 19th century when it was the fear of uprisings such as had happened in the French revolution and later smaller upheavals throughout Europe that convinced the elites that they had to give in to at least some of the democratic aspirations or risk losing all their power - Bismark was particularly adept at such transformations.\n \n Either way, that history is now past. What we face today is restrained capitalism vs other alternatives. You fail to state any clear advantage between communism and the current version of capitalism, with all of its restraints benefiting employees (8 hour work day, employer subsidized health care, etc.). Again, communism showed itself to be a failed system in comparison to this current version of capitalism. If you wish to present a better version of communism than the one that failed, then you need to address those points which made the first version fail. Specifically, you need to address the two points I brought up:\n 1) What incentives would exist for people to work harder on their jobs than their friends and neighbors? \n 2) What specific internal corruption control mechanisms does your version of communism support?",

It's not murder until you have a born person.\n\n \n I'm afraid Federal Law disagrees with you:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unborn_Victims_of_Violence_Act\n \n \nThe Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-212) is a United States law which recognizes a \"child in utero\" as a legal victim, if he or she is injured or killed during the commission of any of over 60 listed federal crimes of violence. The law defines \"child in utero\" as \"a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.\"[2]\n \n The law is codified in two sections of the United States Code: Title 18, Chapter 1 (Crimes), \u00a71841 (18 USC 1841) and Title 10, Chapter 22 (Uniform Code of Military Justice) \u00a7919a (Article 119a).\n \n The law applies only to certain offenses over which the United States government has jurisdiction, including certain crimes committed on Federal properties, against certain Federal officials and employees, and by members of the military. In addition, it covers certain crimes that are defined by statute as federal offenses wherever they occur, no matter who commits them, such as certain crimes of terrorism.\n \n Because of principles of federalism embodied in the United States Constitution, Federal criminal law does not apply to crimes prosecuted by the individual states. However, 34 states also recognize the fetus or \"unborn child\" as a crime victim, at least for purposes of homicide or feticide.[3]\n\n \n Shooterandproud:\n \n Chester is very proud of being identified as a Marxist.

And why is it that you disregard any valid points another poster makes as irrelevant by disregarding them, and in this case with your perversion of what Locke, a british subject represented in order to support your leftist view? I find it interesting that you refer to 18th century thinkers in order to define 21st century American society. But either way, you're perverting what Locke represented. Here is his view on the Social Order regarding both religion and Government; and in all of your debates you have opposed what he represents as he encourages the protection of the citizenry by the Government so would be in favor of protecting the unborn and against giving special rights that allow their unchecked destruction according to the whims of individual americans, ie: the mother, if he were alive today. Locke also resisted the Monarchy's imposition of a state controlled government. \n Locke: Social Order\n \n John Locke's intellectual curiosity and social activism also led him to consider issues of general public concern in the lively political climate of seventeenth-century England. In a series of Letters on Toleration, he argued against the exercise of any governmental effort to promote or to restrict particular religious beliefs and practices. His epistemology is directly relevant to this issue: since we cannot know perfectly the truth about all differences of religious opinion, Locke held, there can be no justification for imposing our own beliefs on others. Thus, although he shared his generation's prejudice against \"enthusiastic\" expressions of religious fervor, Locke officially defended a broad toleration of divergent views.\n \n Locke's political philosophy found its greatest expression in the Two Treatises of Civil Government, published anonymously during the same year that the Essay appeared under his own name. In the First Treatise Locke offered a point-by-point critique of Robert Filmer's Patriarchia, a quasi-religious attempt to show that absolute monarchy is the natural system of human social organization. The Second Treatise on Government develops Locke's own detailed account of the origin, aims, and structure of any civil government. Adopting a general method similar to that of Hobbes, Locke imagined an original state of nature in which individuals rely upon their own strength, then described our escape from this primitive state by entering into a social contract under which the state provides protective services to its citizens. Unlike Hobbes, Locke regarded this contract as revokable. Any civil government depends on the consent of those who are governed, which may be withdrawn at any time.

I would contest this. Up to around the beginning of the third trimester, the embryo / fetus is nothing but a developing body with \"nobody home\" - i.e. no mental existence (no thoughts, no emotions, no sense of self, no feelings of pain, no ability to experience their environment - nothing). I do not see any reason to have forced responsibility over such a living mindless body. As at the end of life when the mind can be gone from accident or illness, it is not worth keeping the empty living body artificially alive. It is the person who effectively resides in the body (through mental brain function or belief in a soul) who we value - not the body itself. \n \n From discussions with those on the pro-life side, it seems clear that the thing that is valued in the embryo / early fetus is not as much what it currently IS but what it WILL BECOME. What it currently IS is only valued because it is on its way to becoming something / someone that we do value. The hypothetical question to test this was how much is such a life valued if it suddenly stopped growing so that it would never reach the stage of lifeform that has emotions, thoughts, feelings of pain, etc. Apparently, its value dropped significantly (at least that was the answer for those not afraid of anwering that question).\n \n However, once there is \"somebody home\" in that body, then I would agree that you now have another person whose rights should be taken into account. Biologically, neurologically speaking, such mental functions can't start before around the beginning of the third trimester. So, I support more clearly legally restricting third trimester abortion rights to the limited exceptions (mother's life, significant risk to health, mercy killing deformed fetuses, etc.). Then it makes sense to speak of an \"other\" to whom one has responsibilities.\n \n One last point. I have heard a few pro-life advocates make the same arguement you do that pro-choice supporters make their arguements simply out of a \"defense rationalization\", where you think they really do agree that they are doing wrong. You don't realize that they actually generally do believe all of what they say. As a general rule of thumb, I tend to think that most people believe what they say. However, many people have holes or inconsistencies in their thinking that one can highlight if one can tell what those holes or inconsistencies are. I have found that the best way to discover such holes and inconsistencies in reasoning is to see what type of questions people make an effort at avoiding to answer. Where the pro-life camp is concerned, I find that a major hole in their reasoning is to highlight what the embryo / early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT , independent of what it will become in the future. This has highlighted that it is only valued by what it WILL BECOME, not for what it currently IS. As for the extreme pro-choice side that would allow abortions at all times for any reason (note: they represent a minority of the pro-choice side), then they get very uncomfortable when you question them about the difference in a fetus one day from birth vs a newborn baby and force them to answer the question of whether or not they would allow a birth-minus-one-day abortion for any reason.\n \n So, instead of jumping to wrong assumptions about the reasoning of pro-choice supporters, search for holes in logic and reasoning that you can exploit. That would be far more effective than your false assumptions that they are harboring guilt.",

   "Thank you, Another Opinion. A very thoughtful analysis.\n \n I do agree that in the third trimester of a pregnancy the rights of another individual comes into play.\n \n If a woman does not want to be pregnant, she should have terminated her pregnancy long before that point.\n \n In the third trimester, I believe that the only good reason to terminate a pregnancy would be the endangerment of the pregnant woman's life, health, or if there were sound evidence that the fetus was profoundly disabled and would survive for only a short and torturous while, or would be profoundly disabled and traumatized throughout life -- able to survive only by extreme and intrusive and painful medical intervention.\n \n One must also consider who would be responsible for the maintenance of such a profoundly disabled individual. If the cold-hearted who insist that a woman must never terminate a pregnancy also force a woman to be totally responsible for what she had given birth to -- as is often the case with these people who have so little regard and respect for women.",

But for those reasons, they can be had in all 50 states. That takes care of the crossing of state lines. There should be a limit of only ONE abortion allowed by any woman so it can never again be used for birth control as so many women use it for now. \n \n Also, the government should be completely responsible for carrying out the abortions with Government funded doctors, offices and statutes protecting the rights of the woman and the child. Take the industry out of private hands like planned parenthood and see how the numbers plummet. Let the money the government raises from abortions that is beyond what is needed to support the infrastructure, go towards supporting pregnant teens and supporting adoption services.\n \n You know what the rub is though? The government considers abortion immoral so it refuses to play an active part in abortion which is why it wont allow public funds to support them. That I agree with by the way, but to allow private industry to control this procedure turns it into another capitalist endeavor which is why it is a growing industry which is averaging 1.3+ million abortions per year right now. \n \n As for criminalization, if any doctors who aren't specifically licensed by the Government are caught doing one, they will lose their license to practice medicine for life and they and their patient will be charged with murder. That should be an excellent incentive to keep them honest, and if not honest, then scared of the consequences for breaking the law. \n \n The same murder charge would apply to any woman or street practitioner who dared to perform illegal abortions under the grid. If the woman died in the act of getting an illegal abortion, he would be charged with 2 counts of first degree murder, with an additional charge of malice, premeditation and forethought which would bring a minimum life in prison without chance of parole for each charge. \n \n As for the father, no abortion could be procured without him being interviewed and approving of it unless the reason is the woman's health, and by that I mean her life is at risk if she carries the baby to term. And if he is willing to take and raise his child then the abortion will be denied the woman. If he opts out, then he is no longer an issue in the decision and the existing rules are then considered based on the woman qualifying in the proper time period and only after being advised of all of the other options, with a proper cooling off period to consider those options. \n \n But he will be responsible for 2/3rds of the financial costs and continued care for the woman, especially if any health issues occur as a result of the abortion being approved and carried out. The result of such a strict policy would immediately result in women and men being much more careful and responsible about their sexual activity. They may just realize that the consequences of getting pregnant are greater than the immediate gratification that comes from having casual sex.\n \n So slaps on the wrist aren't the way to establish a real abortion policy. But creating specific hardcore standards outlined by the Government, enforced by the Government, and carried out by the Government with strict enforcement for lawbreakers is the way to secure a policy which people will respect and abide by. After all, we are dealing with life and death here so the cost for breaking the law must be high. Now, I repeat my prior post regarding the inconsistency of current abortion rights which allow women the unique right to end the life of a perfectly innocent, voiceless person which as usual, you didn't respond to at all. And I'm sure you wont now.\n \n \n \n Then why shouldn't men be allowed to create a situation where an innocent person is brought into their mistake, scam, crime or whatever the situation, even if it's a family member and then be given a legal pass to kill that person for the sake of their personal convenience?

Alternatively, how much higher will you raise taxes to pay for it?\n\n \n More moving the goal posts huh! You take a hypothetical and attempt to turn it into a legislative session of Congress. I answered your challenge to offer a plan to limit abortions in a way that protects both mother and child, and puts teeth into the law for those who usurp the law. \n \n \n6. Bottom line, in your monomaniacal zeal, you are proposing a wildly impractical, undesirable, and necessary solution to a non-existent problem.\n \n The public still favors the right of a woman to terminate her pregnancy; the only real debate is over what if any restrictions could or should exist.\n \n BTW: Re: your \"pre-born\" oxymoron, I'm a pre-millionaire.:)\n\n \n You have no solution to offer to find balance in the tradition of human genocide against the unborn yet you condemn mine with nothing more than more of your irrational rant against reason and a fair playing field that considers the life and welfare of the unborn.",

   "Thank you, Another Opinion. A very thoughtful analysis.\n \n I do agree that in the third trimester of a pregnancy the rights of another individual comes into play.\n \n If a woman does not want to be pregnant, she should have terminated her pregnancy long before that point.\n \n In the third trimester, I believe that the only good reason to terminate a pregnancy would be the endangerment of the pregnant woman's life, health, or if there were sound evidence that the fetus was profoundly disabled and would survive for only a short and torturous while, or would be profoundly disabled and traumatized throughout life -- able to survive only by extreme and intrusive and painful medical intervention.\n \n One must also consider who would be responsible for the maintenance of such a profoundly disabled individual. If the cold-hearted who insist that a woman must never terminate a pregnancy also force a woman to be totally responsible for what she had given birth to -- as is often the case with these people who have so little regard and respect for women.\n\n I agree that this is something that the pro-life crowd has not thought through - i.e. who would take care of such a disabled child. I applaud those who do sacrifice themselves to care for mentally disabled children (those with autism, etc.) but it takes tremendous effort and/or financial resources to be able to care for such children. Most people are not up to it. That would leave them wards of the state - where I would hope that the pro-life crowd would not be so tax-averse as to cut programs supporting such children, or would otherwise be willing to support them through charities. If abortion ever became truly illegal, then there would be a lot more of those children than currently exist - requiring far more financial help to maintain.",

   "Hi Archangel,\n \n I think if you really want an abortion, you will find a way to make it happen. If that means leaving you country to find one that will perform it ... so be it. You have to remember alot of citizens hold passports/dual citizenship to other countries. If they have a British passport and fly to London for an abortion then they are protected by British law. Same with the Mexican/Canadians you have living within your land.\n \n I understand you side Archangel, but i do wonder what would happen to the proposed 1 million unwanted children. Who will care (yes health care inclusive) shelter, protect, raise, fund... them, and not just from birth but here on in? \n I'm cringing from a social services perspective :(\n Its not enough to impose laws such as this without considering the aftermath.\n \n I did have one question regarding your one abortion policy, whilst actually quiet good in theory, how would it pertain to all the woman whose second abortion was needed as a result of extreme circumstances? would their be an exception for them?",

Only then, rather than stick to responding to the HYPOTHETICAL you laid out, WHICH I ANSWERED FULLY, do you expand the debate to areas you never raised originally. And mind you, you haven't responded to anything I have said in a meaningful way at all. All you do is continue to expand the debate and make me do all the work as you try to trap me. Get a clue schmuck, this isn't a one way street here.\n \n \n \nSame old, same old.\n \n What's your solution, Archieemoticon_xclown?\n \n 1. Should abortion be criminalized?\n \n 2. If yes, by whom, the Federal government or the states?\n \n 3. In either case, what are the penalties for breaking the law?\n \n 4. To whom should they be applied - the woman? her doctor? the man (Hint, that would have been you, old chap.)?\n \n 5. If the question is returned to the states, and if state \"A\" criminalizes abortion and state \"B\" has a very liberal law, what is to prevent a female citizen of state \"A\" from traveling to state \"B\" for her abortion?\n \n 6. How will state \"A\" know the reason for her travel when she reaches the border from either direction?\n \n C'mon, let's end the platitudinous bloviation and deal in practicalities here.\n \n The only poster who has had the guts to respond, no matter how feeble her response was, was galactababe. Her proposal was a fine so paltry that it could be raised on any street corner in just a few hours.\n \n How about it, care to try to do better?emoticon_xangel\n\n \n \nIt should be banned except for very specific reasons with no loop holes that allow it to be procured for other reasons outside of those allowed for. But for those reasons, they can be had in all 50 states. That takes care of the crossing of state lines. There should be a limit of only ONE abortion allowed by any woman so it can never again be used for birth control as so many women use it for now. \n \n Also, the government should be completely responsible for carrying out the abortions with Government funded doctors, offices and statutes protecting the rights of the woman and the child. Take the industry out of private hands like planned parenthood and see how the numbers plummet. Let the money the government raises from abortions that is beyond what is needed to support the infrastructure, go towards supporting pregnant teens and supporting adoption services.\n \n You know what the rub is though? The government considers abortion immoral so it refuses to play an active part in abortion which is why it wont allow public funds to support them. That I agree with by the way, but to allow private industry to control this procedure turns it into another capitalist endeavor which is why it is a growing industry which is averaging 1.3+ million abortions per year right now. \n \n As for criminalization, if any doctors who aren't specifically licensed by the Government are caught doing one, they will lose their license to practice medicine for life and they and their patient will be charged with murder. That should be an excellent incentive to keep them honest, and if not honest, then scared of the consequences for breaking the law. \n \n The same murder charge would apply to any woman or street practitioner who dared to perform illegal abortions under the grid. If the woman died in the act of getting an illegal abortion, he would be charged with 2 counts of first degree murder, with an additional charge of malice, premeditation and forethought which would bring a minimum life in prison without chance of parole for each charge. \n \n As for the father, no abortion could be procured without him being interviewed and approving of it unless the reason is the woman's health, and by that I mean her life is at risk if she carries the baby to term. And if he is willing to take and raise his child then the abortion will be denied the woman. If he opts out, then he is no longer an issue in the decision and the existing rules are then considered based on the woman qualifying in the proper time period and only after being advised of all of the other options, with a proper cooling off period to consider those options. \n \n But he will be responsible for 2/3rds of the financial costs and continued care for the woman, especially if any health issues occur as a result of the abortion being approved and carried out. The result of such a strict policy would immediately result in women and men being much more careful and responsible about their sexual activity. They may just realize that the consequences of getting pregnant are greater than the immediate gratification that comes from having casual sex.\n \n So slaps on the wrist aren't the way to establish a real abortion policy. But creating specific hardcore standards outlined by the Government, enforced by the Government, and carried out by the Government with strict enforcement for lawbreakers is the way to secure a policy which people will respect and abide by. After all, we are dealing with life and death here so the cost for breaking the law must be high. Now, I repeat my prior post regarding the inconsistency of current abortion rights which allow women the unique right to end the life of a perfectly innocent, voiceless person which as usual, you didn't respond to at all. And I'm sure you wont now.\n\n \n \n \n How much in the way of resources, i.e., taxes, would you have the government devote to prosecuting these women?\n \n In light of society's real murders - gangland, drive-bys, drug killings, etc., do you really think this is a wise use of the government's resources (our tax money)?\n \n What do you propose as the penalty for this \"murder\"?\n \n If it is other than the DP, you are being wishy-washy on the topic. After all, it is you who constantly bloviates about how the \"unborn\" are the most innocent of all \"victims\".\n \n What if juries assume their rightful role and either acquit every accused or follow the John Peter Zenger responsibility of jury nullification?\n \n What punishment would you meme out to the man who was responsible for creating the pregnancy in the first place. Careful, because by your own admission, that might have been you. After all, it was you who self identified as the man responsible for getting a girl just out of her teens pregnant years ago when you were years older.\n\n \n \nYou're attempting to create problems where none exist. The women would be tried in their home state for illegally usurping american abortion laws by going over the border. As for the man, unless he helped her usurp the law he isn't guilty of breaking that law. Remember, getting her pregnant isn't the crime, assisting her in killing the baby would be. If he did, then he is an accomplice and should be charged accordingly. And your attempt to indite me as guilty of anything illegal is fallacious, as I wouldn't have allowed Mary to get an illegal abortion back then, or now, so we wouldn't have been in a position to worry about such a consequence. And I wouldn't consider this a capital crime, but it could still qualify as a murder charge with the possibility of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. \n \n It would be up to the prosecutor what to charge them with though, based on the individual circumstances of each case. The point is to make the personal cost high enough so that normally law abiding people would be motivated to not break the law in the first place. It would also cause both men and women to think twice before engaging in casual sex which is currently a sort of national past time. \n \n And why am I not surprised that you completely ignored my response to your challenge for a practical solution to this problem of genocide against America's pre-born. emoticon_xdonno\n",

By that I mean, that if we researched the levels of juvenile delinquency in the US now, or any other childhood malady; and I don't know those numbers. But just for the sake of argument, let's say it's at 0.5% per hundred thousand; then add that 1.3 million lives saved and apply the same percentages to them in every category you consider based on real world stats. \n \n Most all of the women who are getting these abortions are working, productive, intelligent vital members of society with families and support systems available to them, and even if they're poor or teens. They will love their children and be nurturing mothers in most all cases. For the ones who need assistance, this Country has those services available at every level of need. From medical and psychiatry for the child, to counseling, housing and job training for mom so she can offer a secure home environment. \n \n \nIn summary, i do like your 'one abortion policy', it has great merit.\n\n \n Thanks, I think it's rational while disciplined, and though it has teeth, it isn't intended to entrap or punish, but to encourage responsible behavior and a conscientious respect for themselves and their actions, not to mention their unborn children who might end up being a genius or child prodigy. MY ARGUMENT IS THIS: THE UNBORN CHILD WE KILL WILL FOREVER REMAIN A QUESTION MARK OF UNREALIZED POTENTIAL. THE CHILD THAT LIVES HAS THE PROMISE AND HOPE OF GREATNESS. AND TO DENY ONES OWN OFFSPRING THAT OPPORTUNITY IS THE GREATEST PUNISHMENT A WOMAN CAN INFLICT UPON HERSELF, AND IS WHY SO MANY ARE HAUNTED FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AFTER SUFFERING THROUGH AN ABORTION WHICH IS MOST ASSUREDLY A FORM OF SELF MUTILATION AS MUCH AS IT IS INFANTICIDE.",

   "Then why shouldn't men be allowed to create a situation where an innocent person is brought into their mistake, scam, crime or whatever the situation, even if it's a family member and then be given a legal pass to kill that person for the sake of their personal convenience? Because that is what abortion adds up to for women. Just because this is a newly conceived human being, with no voice of its own, it is relegated to the position of a throw away human being and that is just plain ole morally and ethically reprehensible by any standard of measure. \n \n For the man it's called murder, yet society has been duped into believing that for women, it's having control over her body. When what it actually is, is giving her control over the body and life of another innocent human being who played no part in causing the so called problem to exist at all, yet is expected to pay for it with his life.\n\n \n \n Men have been giving each other passes on killing each other for a LONG time- innocent or otherwise. But more importantly, the truth is that it is a HORRIBLE decision for a woman to make and I don't care what you think- NONE of them have EVER made it lightly. But all important decisions are the hard ones. I can't imagine what it must be like to conceive (or even to have that potential) a life within myself. But I DO know what its like to have goals and dreams about the future. Some women have goals and desires that don't include having children and for our society to be just they must be able to decide for themselves whether or not they'll have kids. Look back through history at what's been done to women- buried alive with the Pharaoh to accompany him to the afterlife, raped before they are murdered because Allah doesn't permit virgins to be murdered, stoned to death for being raped... they've had a bad deal for most of history. Now we are finally reaching a point of true equality in OUR society, but for a bunch of men to decide that a woman MUST carry a baby to term would set our society only a small step above those I mentioned before. Abortion IS horrible and no one thinks of it as more-so than a woman who decides to have one. However, she's the only on who can make that choice.",

But I also understand that the baby doesn't enjoy giving its life because she doesn't FEEL like she's ready for the the responsibility it requires to be an unexpected parent. This attitude that it's only the woman who's suffering here is crazy thinking in my opinion. You say that I've got to understand that FORCING a woman to have a baby takes the basic right she has over her own body. But what about her need to take responsibility for her irresponsibility in having either casual or unprotected sex? Here are some stats for multiple abortions.\n Multiple abortions are the norm, not the exception. According to the survey, where the \"number of previous abortions was adequately reported,\" 53% of women had an abortion for the first time in 2000. That means 47% of women having abortions in 2000 were not having their first abortion. \n \n How many abortions do women have? The survey breaks it down by state, but stops counting at \"3 or more previous legal induced abortions.\" In 2000, Maryland had the highest percentage of women having their fourth (or more) abortion: 16.7%. New York City had the second highest ratio, with 14.7% of women having at least their fourth abortion in 2000. Facts on Abortion. Statistics, Information, Abortion Facts, Statistics, Stats\n \n This is the aspect of this carnage which must be changed, by force of law if need be.

LMAO! They wouldn't have to be in a back alley if they behaved that is the whole point.

Both arguments cannot be true.\n \n \n \nbut the final decision MUST remain in the hands of women or our society runs the risk of being but a small step above those who bind feet and relegate women to a mere step above servant.\n\n \n \n \n The rubber meets the road on this when women can get pregnant by themselves... when they do, then they can lobby that argument. You don't hear of women getting artificially inseminated then going... \"oops\", lol! sorry. But because it takes two to tango,, and they danced to. No, this is all about behavior and making excuses for bad behavior. The only thing that needs to remain in the hands of women is the same thing for men [under the law] - the knowledge of right from wrong and to know when they have breached that, and that there is no escaping individual consequences for making bad choices. Abortion clearly buffers that... That, and to what extent they are accountable. That is all effective law needs to be, that is what we had had before... funny we didn't' have these problem. It would seem as though the feminist knew they had to craft the excuse along with the lie to spin them both at the same time. \n \n \n Though I completely understand your view point, I as a citizen am called to look at the larger picture and frankly when more of us start doing that - the less room there will be for government interventionism,and that is all I am worried about... too much government.",

Yes accidents and mistakes happen, hence the 'one' abortion policy, but if you are foolish, irresponsible and downright negligent enough to get pregnant a third time (of course and always bar extreme circumstances) then you should be made to accept consequences for your behavior. \n What kind of consequence? i dont know, but i never stated she would be forced to have the baby, I'm saying some consequences should be enforced.\n \n Pro-lifers are right in saying we shouldn't provide a safety net for societies repeated ignorances, and repeated being the base of my argument here. This should not discriminate from a womens responsibility to ensure unwanted pregnancies are not created.\n \n So in conclusion, i am not for removing the right to choice, but i do believe that consequences should ensure those who abuse this right. \n \n What is your opinion of women who have multiple abortions Chester?",

   "\n Her failure? \n \n Are women the only persons who have anything to do with pregnancy?\n \n Is there any chance that males have a role in pregnancy, that one might mention \"HIS failure to control his body\"?\n\n \n Nobody denies that men play an equal apart in getting a woman pregnant. But until men can play an equal part in determining the fate of the pregnancy then they are denied their rights as the co-parent. But you don't want to acknowledge that reality, do you! If a married husband wants his pregnant wife to have their baby that she's carrying, he has no legal say if she decides to abort what is his baby too. How is that fair, right. legal or ethical by any standard of reasonableness? \n \n And if the father of a baby his girlfriend is carrying wants to keep the baby and even signs a contract saying she is relieved of all responsibility of raising the baby, why should she be allowed to kill the baby anyway? And let's reverse the question for the sake of fairplay; If the man doesn't want the baby and the woman does, it matters not to the law, he will still be forced to pay for that baby for 18 years, like it or not. So don't you dare try to hold the man culpable for her pregnancy or claim he has a role in it when no matter what the outcome, she makes all the decisions and controls the outcome based her her whims at the time. \n \n Men have been relegated to the status of sperm donors because of abortion laws, and the only way to equal the playing field is to redefine the abortion policies which right now, favors only the woman to the detriment of the man and the baby in every single case where she decides to abort her child.",

   "I agree whole heartedly that people should have much more responsibility than they exhibit today. However, \"the way it was before\" with deadly coat hanger abortions and women 'knowing their place' without having careers, etc. wasn't where of society's final evolution lay.\n\n \n You mention the deadly coat hanger abortions. You should know that the estimates of 5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year given by the pro-abortion advocates of the time was a complete and total lie. And that has been confirmed by the source of that lie as he admits that he knew he was being deceptive for the sake of the movement he was committed to. Here are the facts of the history of the actual numbers of women who died receiving illegal abortions prior to Roe's passage. \n Before Roe v. Wade, did 10,000 women a year die from illegal abortions?\n \n May 28, 2004\n Dear Cecil:\n \n Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman recently wrote, \"After all, those of us who remember when birth control was illegal and when 10,000 American women a year died from illegal abortions don't have to imagine a world without choices. We were there.\" I write a blog about life after abortion, and one of my co-bloggers says that the claim of 10,000 deaths is well known to be an urban legend. However, Ellen Goodman is a famous journalist, and she clearly believes that it is the truth. Is it?\n \n - Emily of After Abortion, via e-mail\n \n Dear Emily:\n \n No.\n \n Establishing exactly how many women died due to botched illegal abortions is obviously impossible, since many of these deaths likely weren't reported as such. However, even a generous reading of the statistics we do have indicates that Goodman is off by a factor of ten; a stickler might say she blew it by a ratio of 250 to 1. It's not like this is a news flash, either. A reasonable approximation of the annual total in the 60s has been public knowledge for 35 years.\n \n To be fair, the number Goodman uses is consistent with estimates that were widely cited prior to the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. But some say those numbers were knowingly inflated by proponents of abortion rights. The star witness for this claim is Bernard Nathanson, a former abortion clinic doctor who in 1969 cofounded the group now called NARAL Pro-Choice America (the letters originally stood for National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws). Since Roe, though, he's turned against his former comrades - he made the highly controversial 1984 antiabortion film The Silent Scream and has authored several books describing his conversion on this issue and critiquing the abortion-rights movement.\n \n In Aborting America (1979) Nathanson writes: \"In NARAL we generally emphasized the drama of the individual case, not the mass statistics, but when we spoke of the latter it was always '5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year.' I confess that I knew the figures were totally false, and I suppose the others did too if they stopped to think of it. But in the 'morality' of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics?\" (Emphasis is his.)\n \n Better late than never. For 1972, the last full year before Roe, the federal Centers for Disease Control reported that 39 women died due to illegal abortion. (The death total for all abortions, including legal ones, was 88.) That figure is low, thanks to underreporting, but in any case the number of deaths had been dropping sharply for the previous few years. A statistic perhaps more typical of the pre-Roe era was reported in a 1969 Scientific American article cowritten by Christopher Tietze, a senior fellow with the Population Council: \"The National Center for Health Statistics listed 235 deaths from abortion in 1965. Total mortality from illegal abortions was undoubtedly larger than that figure, but in all likelihood it was under 1,000.\"\n \n Had the number been higher in still earlier years? Yes. Tietze comments in his article that \"some 30 years ago [i.e., around 1940], it was judged that such deaths might number 5,000 to 10,000 per year.\" He gives no source, but if we turn to W. Cates et al (\"Trends in national abortion mortality, United States, 1940-1974,\" Advances in Planned Parenthood, 1976), we find that 1,682 abortion-related deaths were officially reported in 1940. If we guess that this figure represents roughly a quarter of actual mortality due to illegal abortion, we get 6,800 deaths - somewhere below the middle of the range given by Tietze, whereas Ellen Goodman's number is at the very top. But that was in 1940, remember. I didn't Google Ms. Goodman to determine when she was born; I'll just say that if she's pushing 80, as her statement \"those of us who remember ... when 10,000 American women a year died from illegal abortions\" would imply, she's remarkably well preserved.\n \n None of this argues for or against abortion, but the claim that legalization has prevented the deaths of thousands upon thousands of women doesn't hold up. Roe v. Wade saved some lives, but the numbers were small - reported deaths due to illegal abortion declined from 39 in 1972 to 5 in 1974. The biggest factor in reducing abortion mortality was undoubtedly the overall improvement in prenatal and obstetrical care after World War II. The rate of pregnancy-related deaths from causes other than abortion dropped at roughly the same pace as the abortion death rate from 1940 through 1974 (though abortion-related deaths did decline faster after 1965, which Cates attributes largely to advances in contraception and the state-by-state relaxation or repeal of abortion laws).\n \n Self-induced and back-alley abortions were becoming a thing of the past long before Roe: sex researcher Alfred Kinsey estimated in the 1950s that around 85 percent of illegal abortions were performed by physicians, even if the physicians weren't all in good standing. The fact is that prior to legalization abortion had become relatively safe and easy to obtain - for those who could afford it. Studies done at the time show that the risks were borne disproportionately by those who couldn't, mostly minorities. Were abortion to be recriminalized, that would likely be the case again.The Straight Dope: Before <em<Roe</em< v. <em<Wade</em<, did 10,000 women a year die from illegal abortions?\n \n Now, notice that [I]For 1972, the last full year before Roe, the federal Centers for Disease Control reported that 39 women died due to illegal abortion. (The death total for all abortions, including legal ones, was 88.)/I] So the fact is that 39 women died from illegal abortions but 10 more than that, or 49 women who received LEGAL abortions that year died. More died from legal than illegal. So the problem with the so called facts which are thrown around by the abortion proponents and often cited by honestly sincere people are fallacious and blatantly dishonest since they were lying in order to accomplish their agenda. Just some food for thought for your consideration.",

   "You make sarcastic, but great point... but don't you mean follow the ideology? It is the feminist and environmental lobby that that have been the largest proponents of abortion. As a nation we face a great problem ahead if we don't settle up with national disater, it is effecting social security... we'd have at least a 30% larger tax base to support our economy. We've got to act on this...\n\n \n Ok, let me explain something:\n Women electively abort for one reason-- MONEY; either she or the father doesn't have enough. If either or both had a billion dollars, there'd be no abortion.\n Therfore her abortion is soley to save (or make) her a LOT of money in comparison-- in addition to helping her try to find a richer guy (i.e. MORE money).\n \n Likewise, abortion makes women \"equal\" by letting them thus EARN as much money as men, by not being tied down via unwanted pregnancies and kids, and related expenses; in addition they can earn MORE by hooking a rich guy (since 90% of women will ONLY marry men who earn more than they do) rather than being a dirt-poor single mom.\n When women \"strike the jackpot\" financially with a rich husband, they chiefly just want to settled down and have kids. \n IT'S THE MONEY!\n \n Meanwhile, socialist countries want to save money by skimping on scant resources, so they simply \"re-define\" when life begins, \"Playing God\" as a matter of convenience in order to avoid spending vast sums on saving nascent children-- since those who would have been aborted, end up costing the most in various public services, and hence are voted as unfit to live, with every problem-pregnancy being aborted-- whether for financial reasons or medical. Pre-natal sugery isn't exactly high on their priorities-list\n \n As for social security, we are simply seeing the inevitable statism come home to roost: FACTIONALISM AGAINST FUTURE GENERATIONS. People simply borrow against the credit of those not yet born, and forcing later generations to pick up the tab.\n \n Again, this is simply the inevitable result of all-powerful democratic government: i.e.there's a general attrition of the majoirty-interest-- and erosion of the rights of the minority. However the fools think that the all-powerful \"national\" government would NEVER violate the Constitution.\n Jefferson said clearly, that \"any debt without a tax to pay it in the same term, is a theft against future voters.\" But that bothers no one now.",

   "Archie,\n This:\n Again you blatantly lie in order to make a fallacious point cap0. Quote me ever making that claim at all. Go on, back up your assertion. I was very sternly dressed down once by Phyllis for being willing to compromise on aborting deformed/seriously damaged fetuses which I believed have no hope of a quality life. And Chloe is a more staunch classical pro-lifer than I am regarding certain reasons for abortion. But what really matters here is that I have never claimed to be the most ardent anything on this forum, and that includes my christianity. I may be the most outspoken conservative in many difficult issues, but I have never held myself up as the most ardent supporter of any school of thought.\n \n from your post #390 on this forum.\n \n OK, I concede. You are correct, and I erred. You are really namby pamby, wishy washy on the subject of abortion.\n \n Now are you satisfied?\n\n \n Again you lie about me. You know darn well I have strong opinions about this issue, but it just isn't within you to be honest about anything you say, is it! And the issue I was objecting to wasn't my commitment to the subject, it was your blatant lie that I said this, and I quote you: [chester] Archie proudly proclaims that he is the most ardent profetallifer on this forum when I never claimed any such thing. But in typical fashion you completely ignore the true focus of the criticism and respond in your usual dishonest way which leads to another lie about me. \n \n And I reposted the second half of that post which you failed to quote so maybe you'll answer the question Holly asked rather than run away from it as you do every question put to you when people attempt to have an honest debate with you.\n \n \n\n And one more thing; if you can't handle the answer, then don't ask the question. You laid out the hypothetical and challenged me to offer a rational abortion policy and that is exactly what I laid out. Since then, you have never responded directly to it, pointed out one flaw in it, or showed where any aspect of it was unfair. Talk about philosophical cowardice, you define the term as you question another posters integrity for daring to agree with me. At least Holly has the personal fortitude to make an objective judgment on this issue. And I repeat Holly's question. What's your opinion of women who have multiple abortions?\n",

   "Why American women choose abortion:\n \nIn the United States, about 6 million women become pregnant per year. Half of all pregnancies are unintended, and of all births, about 1 in 10 newborns have been reported as \"unwanted.\"\n \n Each year, nearly 1.3 million American women have an abortion to end a pregnancy. This number reflects a declining abortion rate, in part because more women are using emergency contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy in the first days after unprotected sex.\n \n The most common reasons women consider abortion are:\n \n * Birth control (contraceptive) failure. Over half of all women who have an abortion used a contraceptive method during the month they became pregnant.\n \n * Inability to support or care for a child.\n \n * To end an unwanted pregnancy.\n \n * To prevent the birth of a child with birth defects or severe medical problems. Such defects are often unknown until routine second-trimester tests are done.\n \n * Pregnancy resulting from rape or incest.\n \n * Physical or mental conditions that endanger the woman's health if the pregnancy is continued.\n \n In the United States, 9 out of 10 abortions are performed in the first 12 weeks (first trimester) of pregnancy. The majority of these are done within the first 8 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n Abortion-Reasons Women Choose Abortion\n \n Sooo, where's the money?",

   "Sorry, abuse meaning the women who fail to use any contraceptive means and continuously use abortion as their safety net. These women abuse the system.\n \n \n \n I didnt say i would remove their right to have the abortion, i am pro choice, but i do believe they should face consequences for their multiple terms of blatant disregard, negligence and abuse of the situation.\n \n Surely they should be made to face some consequence (and no i dont mean nto allowing them to have the abortion)??\n\n \n \n Holly, I agree that there is a segment of people who will abuse ANY system. In fact, my wife's cousin is blacklisted in all the abortion clinics within 200 miles of Myrtle Beach because she's had 5 or 6 abortions and they fear she's due to have problems from excessive scarring. Everyone I know finds this disgusting. But it isn't the abnormal cases that define a system. Just because this freak is a piece of &^$% doesn't give us the right to grill every woman who finds herself in a position that she doesn't want to be in (whether by rape or mistake, or contraceptive failure, or whatever). I don't want to see a panel of 70 year old men whom a woman must beseech and prove her need for abortion. That is between her and her doctor.

Bill creating a buffer zone around abortion clinics. You can read about it here. firstamendmentcenter.org: Assembly - Topic\n \n The question I have is why doesn't this bill also protect religious organizations from militant gays who encroach on churches and block entry to them, or worse yet, enter them and disrupt the service as a group did in California recently? Also, why doesn't it apply to Peta who also throws red paint which represents blood on women wearing furs? Again, we see inconsistency in the laws which limit one group while giving others a pass using the same tactics.\n To protect women and abortion-clinic doctors and staff, Congress in 1994 passed a law called F.A.C.E. &#8212; the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (18 U.S.C., Sect. 248). The law prohibits injuring, intimidating or interfering with any person who obtains or provides reproductive health services. It provides for civil and criminal penalties against violators. The law has survived several First Amendment challenges.\n \n Sometimes courts will pass a special injunction providing for even greater control over anti-abortion demonstrators.

   "You are exactly right that the question is one of the rule of law.\n \n The simple fact is that the LAW says, and has said for the past 35 years, that a woman has the right to choose whether or not to continue her pregnancy.\n \n End of that discussion.\n Nope, we are still going to discuss it, debate it and change the law. \"Good people change bad laws.\"\n Now, as to the money involved, frankly many of us are sick to death of the platitudinous bloviations of the righttofetallifers here.:(\n \n Why not let us know just how many dollars of folks' tax money you are willing to spend in pursuit of your impossible dream?\n \n Why not let us know just what type of Draconian restrictions you are willing to put on people in pursuit of your impossible dream?\n \n The right to life is not \"draconian,\" rather laws protecting life are right, and just. \n \n Why not let us know why you are willing to sacrifice, for example, the educations of real, born people in order to throw money at your impossible dream?\n The unborn are real, and they are human people. Whether or not they have traveled down the birth canal does not have any affect on their humanity whatsoever. The life is what we are protecting. When lives are devalued, all lives lose value.\n We are constantly told in the USA that we cannot solve problems in the country by throwing money at them, yet that is just what you propose.\n \n If you were faced with spending our money on weapons for our military or establishing checkpoints that would prohibit pregnant women from traveling from states with restrictive abortion laws to those with liberal laws, which would you choose? (Not that I expect a straight answer.)\n One component to solving our social problems is giving a good education to all, that means to teach the truth about our origins and the worth of each human. No guns are necessary. It is a fact that mothers are less likely to kill their own unborn child once the are educated with an ultrasound of him or her in utero. \n Give us the numbers, unless, of course, to do so would reveal the profetallifers for the fanatics they really are.\n\n \n What is a fanatic? and what is wrong with being one?

The single cell travels along one of her fallopian tubes toward her uterus. If sperm cells reach the egg while it is still viable, one of them might penetrate the egg, fertilizing it and causing it to begin to divide. Sometimes, the fertilized egg implants in the lining of the uterus and begins to develop, and the woman is considered to be pregnant.\n \n But about 30 to 70 percent of the time, the fertilized egg fails to implant and is flushed from the woman's body during her next menstrual period without her ever knowing about it. This is not considered a miscarriage because the egg never implanted and never initiated the physical changes of pregnancy.\n\n Cover Story | Boulder Weekly: The only independent newspaper in Boulder, Colorado\n \n But, fact and reality are not a part of fetus worshippers' lives.",

I think you are totally confused squeezing apples with oranges and wondering where is the lemonade. \n I have never mentioned a zygote, or a blastocyst or an embryo. \n I am against abortion in general but in particular after the first trimester. Why? because after the first trimester the foetus experiences pain. \n This moral position of mine has nothing to do with theism or the Bible or any source of moral precepts, it is strictly secular. To kill a human being after or before she is born is a crime in my opinion. \n A new born is also not fully developed and helpless to live on her own, the only difference being that is outside the womb, so is it moral to kill her?\n Oh, she is sentient. But who decided that to kill a non-sentient human being who is at an earlier stage or her development is OK? You?\n \n On God:\n It is ridiculous to believe in an anthropomorphic God, that only shows how limited our imagination is. The existence of God can't be either proven or disproved and that is precisely the agnostic position : \"I don't think there is a way to ascertain the existence or non existence of God\" not to be confused with: \"I don't know if God exists or not\".",

Along with social policies that make it easier for parents to have children, if they wish to folllow through on the pregnancy. That is pre-natal care, childcare, early childhood education, etc.\n \n If we had the medical system that you have in Australia, that in itself would likely make it much easier for women to decide to follow through on their pregnancies.\n \n But simply treating abortion like a crime does nothing but hurt people.",

   "Do pro lifers consider the ECP (morning after pill) a form of abortion?\n Interestingly enough i was watching a case on Boston Legal where a catholic ER doctor was being prosecuted because (due to religious beliefs) he failed to administer any emergency contraception after an unconscious, underage rape victim was admitted. His medical negligence, hindered by his religous beliefs resulted in the unsanctioned pregnancy of a minor.\n \n Does any pro-lifer agree with such actions?\n\n \n So the Doctor saved a life and now he is being prosecuted? I thought that is what medicine is all about, to save lives. \n \n In my home country (Chile) where abortion is illegal, the morning after pill is legal. Why? Because we have a socialist government that declared it an anticonceptive not an abortive pill. Of course there were long and well reasoned debates by lawyers and doctors on both side of the abortion divide. (not like this thread, apart from me, that is LOL)\n To make a long story short: it was declared an anticonceptive, although stops an already fertilised egg from implanting in the uterus. \n The anti-abortion camp said it was an abortion for the egg was already fertilised. The pro-abortion camp said that it couldn&#8217;t be established (no test is required to administer the pill) so it was only a precaution as it also prevents or delays ovulation. In any case it is legal in Chile and I totally support it. \n \n I learnt so much about it following the debates in El Mercurio.\n \n I bet all those pro-abortions women in this thread have never had an abortion.

   "Hi mae, I am 55 years old today and took my girlfriend to NY a couple of months after Roe v Wade was passed and she got an abortion which I paid for. What also needs to be known is that at 19 and 20 we were young, innocent and gullible. We went to a family planning clinic and asked that lady/councilor specifically about the development of the baby at the 12 week point when the abortion would be performed. Her response is burned into my psyche as she pointed to her baby fingernail and said it's a blob of blood and tissue that's smaller than a peanut.\n \n Neither of us really wanted to do this but we were both afraid to tell our parents such news. And I wasn't a believer in Christ yet for another 3 years. Around 1981 I was married and was holding my second and youngest daughter, a newborn, in my arms as I watched the evening News. All of a sudden, the reporter said a new womb camera has been invented and you're about to see something that has never been seen before. And right there on the tube we see a 12 week old fetus in the womb and it was substantial compared to a peanut sized clot of blood and cells as shown here: Minti - 12 week old Fetus - Photo I was shocked and immediately, yet for the first time understood what i had done. \n \n So I wasn't a hypocrite back then as I had no spiritual or moral convictions either way about abortion. I was ignorant and knew no better just like the people here who argue in favor of abortion. I say this not to justify my actions, but to explain what happened and why.\n\n \n \nIf so-called abortions happen without first having given all of the information available about the unborn and all the options for distressed parents there is no such thing as this so-called \"choice.\"\n \n It is tragic that so many people have been deceived and lied to. I am so sorry for your loss. I am glad that you are willing to fight for right. God bless you.\n \n I too, have a story. But I am on the other end. I am the product of a rape. I am a testimony to the intrinsic worth of each person created.\n \n My mother said, \"Well, I just thought I got the better end of the deal,\" \"I got YOU.\"\n\n \n Obviously your mother is a wise and very special woman not to have blamed you for the sin of her rapist. And you are positive evidence of each persons value even if their conception was unintended, unplanned and even occurred through violence. \n \n As for planned parenthood lying to us; it begs the question as to why they would seem to have such a personal stake in making the abortion take place that they would lie to, and misinform an innocent young couple who only wanted honest fact before making a decision. One would think they would consider abortion as a last resort procedure, but that wasn't how it was at all. I am and was angry at how effectively she minimized the procedure as just minor surgery of no importance at all when the psychological impact it had on my girlfriend was enormous. They didn't warn us about the sense of loss and the depression which would follow her around for years.",

Of all dispositions and habits that lead to \n political prosperity, our religion and morality are indispensable \n supporters.\" \n \n * In 1782, the U.S. Congress voted in favor of a resolution recommending and \n approving the Bible for use in the schools. \n \n * Henry Laurens, fourth president of the Continental Congress, stated, \"I \n had the honor of being one who framed the Constitution. In order \n effectually to accomplish these great constitutional ends, it is especially \n the duty of those who bear rule to promote and encourage respect for God and \n virtue.\" \n \n Patrick Henry, first governor of my beloved Virginia and a member of the \n Continental Congress, stated, \"It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too \n often that this great nation was founded, not by religionists, but by \n Christians; not on religions, but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. For this \n very reason peoples of other faiths have been afforded asylum, prosperity, \n and freedom of worship here.\" \n \n On Sunday Closing Laws:\n \n \"These two cases, along with McGowan v.

Ed. 2d 563, resulted in similar and complementary rulings that the Sunday closing laws were valid. The Supreme Court recognized the religious origins of the laws but determined that the present purpose of the laws was not religious and that the laws were not invalid because they worked an economic disadvantage to some religious sects.\"\n \n Every one of the Ten Commandments has been used and argued in judicial litigation in the last 200 years and earlier.

Deobandism is an Islamic movement started in British India with two of its main goals being to unify and reform Muslims in India, there being a small population of Muslims and an imposing threat of British culture that could corrupt many young Muslims. The Taliban took the teachings from this sect of Deobandism and fused them with their own beliefs from Afghanistan. This group began to take over Afghanistan in 1994. In 1996 they imposed a form of Islamic holy law, or Shari'a, in controlled areas. Under Shari'a all citizens are entitled to five rights: life, intellect, family, property and religion. The Taliban took these rights mainly from women by making it so that women could not be educated over the age of eight, could not work at all, could not reveal more than their eyes and palms and could not leave the house without a male relative. Other restrictions upon the general population were the banning of television, photography, movies, kite-flying and chess. Punishments of breaking these laws are harsh, for example, the public amputation of the hand if you steal, stoning to death if you commit adultery or imprisonment if your beard was not the required length. This same year Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, was taken and the year after the Taliban effectively controlled 2/3 of the country. The Taliban's interpretation of Islam being greatly influenced from a Deoband education in Pakistan it is possible that other people have been and can be educated by these same people spreading their fundamentalist interpretation of Islam. The Taliban itself can spread its constrictive interpretation of Islam to other people through education. This is still a problem because the people learning these disjointed Islamic views can form Taliban-like groups and are likely to be recruited by terrorist organizations due to their educators close ties with these organizations. normlife.com",

This one was in Indianapolis. I was dropped off at the front door to check in by myself. While they found a parking spot, I was whisked away very quickly to the back........I carried that depression, guilt, and self hate thru my years of new motherhood and marriage. I have 3 beautiful children who now know my story. I divorced their father after a miserable 11 year marriage. Most of the misery was self inflicted as there had been no counseling or forgiveness.\n \n Becky:\n At first I was relieved it was over and felt badly about not having much guilt. Over the years, I have come to regret it immensely and now not a day goes by that I don't think about it in one way or another.\n \n Cheryl\n I just turned 50 and I am tired. I am so tired because I have been running from myself for too long. 34 years and I have just caught up with myself. I got pregnant at the age of 16. My parents forced me into an abortion. The father had been in trouble prior to this and they threatened to have him sent away. They carried guns with them and told me if they ever saw me even talking to him that they would kill him and then themselves. That was the final straw. I could not hurt him or his family anymore. I gave in. He thought that I miscarried. They let me see him again afterward but only if they were in the room with us. I knew that I loved him enough that I had to let him go. He never understood what happened. I told him that when both of my parents were gone that I would explain. \n \n I went on to get married and had 2 beautiful children, but one had severe handicaps. I felt that this was my punishment. But why did my daughter have to be punished for my sins? I wanted to confront my parents about what they did to me, but kept putting it off. My daughter was 1 1/2 and my mother died suddenly. I never got to ask her why? I had almost 21 more years with my father and never got the nerve to confront him. When he was diagnosed with cancer, how could I confront a dying man with what he had done to me? At the same time I panicked, knowing the promise that I had made with the father of my lost baby.\n \n I lived with the guilt of what I had done alone for years. I finally told a couple of close friends. They would listen and try to understand but didn't really. My husband knew and thought that it was all about the father of the baby. For all those years, I did too. I met with the father of the unborn baby and confessed. I thought that I would feel closure. I didn't. It took telling the baby's father and my dad dying to realize that this pain was about me and all that I had been through. My husband just didn't get it. He heard my words but just didn't listen to and hear my pain. I regret not confronting my parents when they were alive and now it's too late. They died thinking that I was fine and that they did the best thing for me. They were so wrong. I just seemed fine because I got good at it. I wore a mask to hide my pain for 34 years. \n \n \n Listen. Please.\n \n There are thousands upon thousands of women who have a message. Please listen to them.",

Eg; more than one case reference, possibly a dissertation citing mass evidence/case loads. \n \n Here is what wiki had to say on the matter of sourcing evidence, it may help you in future. :)\n \n In general, the most reliable sources are peer-reviewed journals and books published in university presses; university-level textbooks; magazines, journals, and books published by respected publishing houses; and mainstream newspapers. As a rule of thumb, the greater the degree of scrutiny involved in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the evidence and arguments of a particular work, the more reliable it is.\n \n Academic and peer-reviewed publications are highly valued and usually the most reliable sources in areas where they are available, such as history, medicine and science. Material from reliable non-academic sources may also be used in these areas, particularly if they are respected mainstream publications. The appropriateness of any source always depends on the context. Where there is disagreement between sources, their views should be clearly attributed in the text.\n ",

   "[QUOTE]\nAnd yet for a fetus their is no death certificate issued, no funeral, no buriel ... or any other ritual performed from the passing of human beings.\n\n \n You just know everything about everyone, don't you? LOL.\n Couples and families often have very personal ways of dealing with the death of an unborn child no matter how or when it died. \n \n As a calligrapher, I have had couples ask me to make them a memorial certificate for their unborn child who died.\n \n Part of the problem with grieving openly is the ridicule they receive from ignorant hard-hearted individals.\n \n With the wide use of ultra sound, the child is readily seen and its sex is determined. The child is often named as a result of knowing the sex and seeing it. Therefore, it is expected that parents would grieve at the loss of the child.\n \n Furthermore, the abortion clinics do NOT let the mother see her dead child. They sometimes do and it is very traumatic for them. Planned Parenthood also does not allow the press to get out that women have died as a result of an abortion at their clinic. \n \n \n \n \nThere is no point debating with you if you continue along your intellectually bankrupt lines. Firstly i asked you to provide proof/evidence of your claims against planned parenthood. You claim they lie and force women into having abortions. \n\n \n You cannot hear. You do not listen. You do not care.\n \n \n \nSecondly, and once again, i do ask that you read the entire thread before making snatched references to it. Archangel also said this meeting with planned parenthood took place decades ago when he was quiet young. It is not a representation of the present.\n\n \n Carolina Review: January 2006While I was with the doctor, I asked her what she would tell a pregnant UNC student who did not know what options were available to her. Immediately the doctor handed me a Planned Parenthood pamphlet and told me that they offer a \"variety of services-surgical abortion, chemical abortion, and birth control.\"\n \n \"The counseling Planned Parenthood offers students, on the other hand, is completely inadequate. When talking to students who are trying to decide whether or not to keep their baby, they discuss the following: a person is ready for parenthood, they say, when they are ready to make a child feel loved and wanted (implying that the child has no inherent worth of its own-it is all based on the mother's feelings at the moment), and when they have the support of family and friends (implying that if your friends do not want you to have a baby, then you should simply kill it).\"\n \n \"This is no counseling for a college student, and will automatically make the parenting option seem completely unfeasible. Students need real counsel. I was shocked at the sheer lack of any choice in the options the doctor laid out.\" Carolina Review, NCU-Chapel Hill, An Investigation of Abortion Practices at the University, January 2006\n \n Fact: Above is only one article written about the manipulative so-called counseling pregnant women receive when they enter a Planned Parenthood. With only one mention of adoption, saying you will have to go thru such and such to give your baby up... they pretend they have \"given all the options.\" But their goal is to promote abortion for crisis pregnancies. And they overwhelmingly meet their goal. Only 1-2% of cases are referred to adoption agencies.",

   " Should i attach a 101 reference guide for sourcing/submitting evidence. Please refer to my post below regarding evidential submissions....\n \n \n ...Um, i know I'm only a brand new law student but posting random, un-sourced, non credible ramblings does not constitute 'proof'. \n And since you previously accuse planned parenthood of being vastly corrupt in regards to their counselling services you would need to provide evidence suitable of a vast nature. Eg; more than one case reference, possibly a dissertation citing mass evidence/case loads. \n \n Here is what wiki had to say on the matter of sourcing evidence, it may help you in future. :)\n \n In general, the most reliable sources are peer-reviewed journals and books published in university presses; university-level textbooks; magazines, journals, and books published by respected publishing houses; and mainstream newspapers. As a rule of thumb, the greater the degree of scrutiny involved in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the evidence and arguments of a particular work, the more reliable it is.\n \n Academic and peer-reviewed publications are highly valued and usually the most reliable sources in areas where they are available, such as history, medicine and science. Material from reliable non-academic sources may also be used in these areas, particularly if they are respected mainstream publications. The appropriateness of any source always depends on the context. Where there is disagreement between sources, their views should be clearly attributed in the text.\n \n\n\n \n If you are a law student perhaps you would be interested in reading about Simon Greenleaf, a founder of Harvard Law School and his Treatise of the Laws of Evidence, which a classic of American jurisprudence. He began writing Testimony of the Evangelists essay as a skeptic of Christianity setting out to disprove the Bible. \n \n The Testimony of the Evangelists Examined by the Rules of Evidence Administered in Courts of Justice'' or simply The Testimony of the Evangelists is an 1846 Christian apologetic work by Simon Greenleaf, a principal founder of the Harvard Law School. His \"A Treatise on the Law of Evidence (15 vols., 1842-1853)\" forms the basis for his study of the gospels. Greenleaf came to the conclusion that the witnesses were reliable, and that the resurrection happened...\n \n ....Greenleaf begins his book by arguing for the need to suspend prejudices and to be open to conviction, \"to follow the truth wherever it may lead us\". Wikipedia/ Simon Greenleaf\n \n Christianity does not profess to convince the perverse and headstrong, to bring irresistible evidence to the daring and profane, to vanquish the proud scorner, and afford evidences from which the careless and perverse cannot possibly escape. This might go to destroy man's responsibility. All that Christianity professes, is to propose such evidences as may satisfy the meek, the tractable, the candid, the serious inquirer.\" Simon Greenleaf/Testimony of the Evangelists\n It is quite informative.

   "Winston,\n \n So what are you saying? You don't believe in putting people on life support systems in hospitals, either?\n \n There's no semantic trick. I am simply calling things by their right name. You should try it sometime. It will clear out your thinking.\n \n See you.\n\n \n As usual you are putting words in my mouth (it is becoming tiresome) I pointed out to you that abortion was not a natural process as per the definition of the dictionary, I provided you with the link.\n Why? because you dishonestly tried to obliterate the distinction between natural (as pertaining to nature and not man's intervention) and artificial.\n I did not say that I was against all non-natural interventions. I have never said that I don't support putting people on life support in hospitals. where did I say that?\n \n It is dishonest of you to continue trying to put words in my mouth.\n \n No, I don't think I'll be 'seeing' you. I have better things to do than continue throwing out what you try to put in my mouth.\n \n We are thinking of going after Christmas to Canberra, to the National Gallery to see an exhibition of Degas. He was so good at depicting the human figure. I love his strong lines and that blacker than black black of his. My favourite Impresionist painting ? one by Monet of a little sailing boat riding a green wave. I saw it in a museum in Amsterdam a couple of years ago. I have never seen a more realistic sea, incredible! and the little boat appears about to sail out of its frame in a second or two. I bought a postcard reproduction of it and have it in front of me on a shelf.\n \n \n As I said before, a pity you didn't debate honestly and instead relentlessly tried to make me appear what I am not. Of course being what I am, I did not call you names or reciprocated; on the contrary, I took your words at face value and did not try to stereotype you or profile you or stick a label on you. \n \n I am sure you will find others to debate with, and hopefully, (for them) you won't continue using your underhanded debating tactics.\n \n Merry Xmas\n \n Chao, I mean:\n \n Adios",

I prefer the understated Aussies. :)\n Went to Manly beach the other day, had lunch with my wife and daughter at a beach front restaurant. I love Sydney.\n \n Now, to answer your question:\n \n \n Well, if a woman is desperate enough to have an abortion I'd rather have it done by a Doctor in a hospital or clinic than by a butcher in a filthy room.\n There has always been women requiring an abortion and there always be. I don't hate women on the contrary, therefore I wish them no harm\n Look, I am not judging anyone it is between them and their conscience.\n \n Did you see that recent Romanian film about those two girls one of them needing an abortion and the other one, her friend helping her find an abortionist? \n It was a good movie, I can't remember the name. \n \n I just Googled it:\n \n Romanian abortion film wins top Cannes prize. 28/05/2007. ABC News Online\n \n A pity Antonia had to resort to underhanded tactics just in order not to admit she was wrong sometimes, it was uncalled for since she is intelligent (more than I) \n To me this is not about scoring points, not about winning the argument no matter what. To me an ideal forum is where we go about interchanging opinions, not proselytising. At least this is how I approach a thread and if others don't, well I simply stop interacting with them. I am old, I have no much time in me left to waste it in sterile argumentation. LOL\n \n Chao,",

   "OK. Let's assume for the sake of argument that your absurd POV prevails.\n \n What will your statute outlawing abortion look like?\n \n Who will be subject to its provisions?\n \n How will abortions be detected?\n \n What will the sanctions be?\n \n To whom will they be applied?\n \n What will the cost in dollars be to enforce your statute?\n \n I'm really getting tired of the same old sanctimonious bloviations about the origins of life and when personhood does or does not begin.\n \n Why won't you profetallifers ever climb down from your ivory towers and discuss the nuts and bolts of what happens when you prevail and the nanny state intrudes itself into the most personal decision a woman can ever make.emoticon_angry\n \n Keep the government out altogether.emoticon_idea\n\n\n \n \n Who makes the laws? Congress. When Roe is overturned based on the fact that, first of all, it is unconstitutional, secondly, it contradicts itself and implies a pneumbra for women but not for children. Finally, Blackmun skirted around the truth of when human life begins, thus committing an egregious error in his opinion. \n \n Good people change bad laws, and we will overturn Roe v Wade. We never advocate a nanny state, but a state which protects not only some lives but all lives....after all, it is an inalienable right.\n \n We will do what we have been doing, but on a grander scale. We will fund only clinics which are effective in keeping young girls and women healthy. We will provide education on healthy living. We will provide services and help for those needing help with their babies. We will place babies in homes waiting to adopt.\n \n As for the law, it will operate like every other piece of legislation. Doctors are to do no harm, and will live up to that expectation. Anyone providing an illegal abortion will face legal action. You stupidly act like every law breaker in the world will be proscecuted, when you know that is never the case. As for abortions (legal) causing harm to a woman, that is still the case today. Planned Parenthood has been the cause of many damaged uteruses, caused many to become infertile, and has caused deaths due to their so-called \"safe abortions.\" The more cases there are the more chance for damage and death.\n \n Women who abort may not always nor immediately suffer, but they will in time. It is ironic that abortion is sold as a way to relieve women from harmful conseqences and billed as something which never harms women, while it hurts every woman, child and family it touches.\n \n Physicians know and believe that life begins at conception. Many testified before congress....\n \n In the words of Dr. Lejeune: \"Each of us has a very precise starting moment which is the time at which the whole necessary and sufficient genetic information is gathered inside one cell, the fertilized egg, and this is the moment of fertilization. There is not the slightest doubt about that and we know that this information is written on a kind of ribbon which we call the DNA&#8230;Nature has used the smallest possible language to carry the information from father to children, from mother to children, from generation to generation&#8230;At no time is the human being a blob of protoplasm. As far as your nature is concerned, I see no difference between the early person that you were at conception and the late person which you are now. You were and are a human being.\"\n This is an excerpt from a thouroughly researched and thought out argument against Roe. If any of you are interested in actual facts: \n Recall the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision, which declared that slavery could not be prohibited by Congress in any territory of the U.S. and that African Americans were not full persons and not afforded the same rights as \"full persons.\" Sound familiar? President Lincoln argued that the slaves were persons, not possessions, and that their unalienable right to liberty was protected by the Declaration of Independence unborn. To add to the irony, after the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, came the Thirteenth (1865) and Fourteenth (1868) Amendments, all which overthrew slavery and the erroneous Dred Scott Supreme Court decision. The Fourteenth Amendment...how ironic. One of the Amendments which helped overturn Dred Scott is now used to further the \"non-person\" argument -the same argument the Amendment was created to prevent! How can the Supreme Court use the Fourteenth Amendment to help justify denying the unborn unalienable rights when this Amendment was supposed to protect people from such selective rights attribution?Roe V Wade - The Unconstitutional Decision",

   "Hi Holly:\n So you couldn't cope more nonsense from nononsense?\n \n\n \n Surely thats rhetorical ;) I miss Archangel!\n \n \n \nNow, to answer your question:\n \n Well, if a woman is desperate enough to have an abortion I'd rather have it done by a Doctor in a hospital or clinic than by a butcher in a filthy room.\n There has always been women requiring an abortion and there always be. I don't hate women on the contrary, therefore I wish them no harm\n Look, I am not judging anyone it is between them and their conscience.\n \n\n \n I think that is a very balanced perspective, i tend to agree. I think the procedure that is abortion is horrendous, i hope i never have to consider it (rape and medical issues being the only reason i would). But i would never condemn those who would to an inhumane backyard butchery. I value women to much. \n \n \nDid you see that recent Romanian film about those two girls one of them needing an abortion and the other one, her friend helping her find an abortionist? \n It was a good movie, I can't remember the name. \n \n\n \n Wow this film looks very profound, i would love to see it, where did you find it?",

When a child is conceived, it is the result of an act of procreation. Don't have sex, if you don't want to have children. \n\n When you say \"fully human\", what do you mean by that? In what way is a zygote or early embryo \"fully human\"?\n \n I have often found that those on the pro-life side tend to imagine the embryo as the baby it will become, not for what that embryo actually is at that moment. I can understand that emotion, but it is based on imagination, not reality, so one cannot base a law on it. The early fetus / embryo has no mind yet that can feel pain, fear, joy, any will to live, feel any sensory input ...nothing. At that early stage, it is just a body with \"nobody home\". Any movements at that stage are only reflex action - not actions due to a mind controlling that movement or feeling their effect. \n \n Our imaginations can deceive us into thinking otherwise since, after all, it starts to \"look\" human fairly early on. It has a heart beat fairly early on and other aspects that make us try to relate to it. However, I find it important to be able to step back and judge objectively whether what one is imagining is actually true. Does the fact that it starts to look like us mean that it really is like us? In the most critical sense, I would say no since it cannot have any sense of mind / mental existence until fairly late in the pregnancy. That mental existence is what makes us us - it is the core aspect of our lives as people that one cannot due without. \n \n I, and many others on the pro-choice side, find that dividing line of the onset of potential mental existence as critically important in defining abortion rights. Before that human body gains any mental existence, it is, once again, just a body with \"nobody home\" which many of us view as not deserving rights (mere bodies don't deserve rights) so the woman can abort it at that stage for whatever reason she chooses since her right to her own body is unchallenged by any other right. However, once the fetus can start to have a mental existence (when there is a \"somebody\" now present in the body), then fetal rights to life also have to be taken into account. This happens around the beginning of the third trimester. \n \n Because of this, many of us on the pro-choice side would limit third trimester abortion rights to a handful of exceptions (risk to mother's life, health, etc.) but would keep first and second trimester abortions rights free. Indeed, around 84% of Americans think that third trimester abortions should be generally outlawed (generally meaning outlawed minus certain exceptions). Those statistics show that the majority of pro-choice supporters would also generally outlaw third trimester abortions - some for reasons similar to my own, some for reasons of viability or other arguements. Those here that argue the extreme of no restrictions on abortion rights for any reason ever, are definitely the minority with only about 10% of Americans supporting those views. What is also interesting is that about 2/3rds of Americans support first trimester abortions being legal - where those statistics would reveal that a minority of those calling themselves pro-life do support abortion rights if the abortions would happen very early on. So, the two camps are not as extreme as some of the rhethoric in this forum might suggest. The spread also shows that the issues are more complex. Note: The statistics I quote come from Abortion , a CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll from 2003 (the last one I have seen that divides the question into trimesters).",

When one reaches this point in the 'debate' it is time to bid Adios and stop talking with that person, for there is no dialogue at this point.\n Of course according to zealots no one but them has the 'right' to voice an opinion about the issue being discussed.\n In Chile I had no right to speak my mind about politics because I was a 'rich kid' out of touch with the lives of the poor, according to the Communists (although all of their leaders came also from affluent families) here I am a 'man' therefore I have no right to voice my opinion on \"women's\" issues.\n Who gave these people the right to assign or deny rights? Another question without an answer.\n The goal of these people is to shut up and drive away anyone who disagrees with them.\n Oh, one more thing, whatever they do they accuse the other side of doing, they are the only ones guilty of, such as this: \"some people can dish it our but cannot take it\".\n Hollyh is the only one here who saw that complex issues have no clear answers and therefore we hold contradictory positions in our minds.\n I am always an optimist and I always argue in good faith, with a touch of humour, and take other people's words at face value but soon the zealots with an axe to grind and a big chip on their shoulders begin to swing the axe and it is the end of the conversation. \n It is OK with me, for forums are not my intellectual life at all.

It has a heart beat fairly early on and other aspects that make us try to relate to it. However, I find it important to be able to step back and judge objectively whether what one is imagining is actually true. Does the fact that it starts to look like us mean that it really is like us? In the most critical sense, I would say no since it cannot have any sense of mind / mental existence until fairly late in the pregnancy. That mental existence is what makes us us - it is the core aspect of our lives as people that one cannot due without. \n \n I, and many others on the pro-choice side, find that dividing line of the onset of potential mental existence as critically important in defining abortion rights. Before that human body gains any mental existence, it is, once again, just a body with \"nobody home\" which many of us view as not deserving rights (mere bodies don't deserve rights) so the woman can abort it at that stage for whatever reason she chooses since her right to her own body is unchallenged by any other right. However, once the fetus can start to have a mental existence (when there is a \"somebody\" now present in the body), then fetal rights to life also have to be taken into account. This happens around the beginning of the third trimester. \n \n Because of this, many of us on the pro-choice side would limit third trimester abortion rights to a handful of exceptions (risk to mother's life, health, etc.) but would keep first and second trimester abortions rights free. Indeed, around 84% of Americans think that third trimester abortions should be generally outlawed (generally meaning outlawed minus certain exceptions). Those statistics show that the majority of pro-choice supporters would also generally outlaw third trimester abortions - some for reasons similar to my own, some for reasons of viability or other arguements. Those here that argue the extreme of no restrictions on abortion rights for any reason ever, are definitely the minority with only about 10% of Americans supporting those views. What is also interesting is that about 2/3rds of Americans support first trimester abortions being legal - where those statistics would reveal that a minority of those calling themselves pro-life do support abortion rights if the abortions would happen very early on. So, the two camps are not as extreme as some of the rhethoric in this forum might suggest. The spread also shows that the issues are more complex. Note: The statistics I quote come from Abortion , a CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll from 2003 (the last one I have seen that divides the question into trimesters).\n\n \n the problem is that your measuring stick for 'human' is a human being after being born.\n \n a human foetus, can only be a 'human' foetus, what else can it be? a dog foetus, a non-human foetus, an extra-terrestial foetus? \n \n a human being is always changing from the moment of conception till she/dies\n \n to say that a human being can have only the right to live only after a particular arbitrary point in her development was chosen just to justify abortion.\n \n This is the crux of the matter. as simple as that",

The abortion clinics lie and say they want to reduce the number of abortions. First of all, why do they even say that when they think it is no big deal? Secondly, if they really wanted to reduce the numbers then there are things which would be effective to that end. However, they do things which increase the numbers.\n \n On the other hand, I, and others like me are focused on solutions to reduce the number of women who feel like they have no other choice than to kill their own children.

   "Who makes the laws? Congress. When Roe is overturned based on the fact that, first of all, it is unconstitutional, secondly, it contradicts itself and implies a pneumbra for women but not for children. Finally, Blackmun skirted around the truth of when human life begins, thus committing an egregious error in his opinion.\n\n As stated in the Bible, Genesis 2:7, life begins:\n \n And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\n \n God instill humanity into a newborn upon its first breath of life. We humans, however, we humans in America have decreed under law that a fetus gains the right of being human when it is capable of surviving outside the womb.\n \nGood people change bad laws, and we will overturn Roe v Wade. We never advocate a nanny state, but a state which protects not only some lives but all lives....after all, it is an inalienable right.\n\n Good people will decree that women own their bodies and are not subject to the whims of church and state in that regard.\n \nWe will do what we have been doing, but on a grander scale. We will fund only clinics which are effective in keeping young girls and women healthy. We will provide education on healthy living. We will provide services and help for those needing help with their babies. We will place babies in homes waiting to adopt.\n\n You will, in your un-American arrogance, seek to have absolute rule over the lives, liberties and persons of women and girls, you mean. You will be utterly unlawful in such endeavors, you, this fascist royal \"We\" you call yourselves, I will fight you to my death if you attempt to overthrow my nation.\n \nAs for the law, it will operate like every other piece of legislation. Doctors are to do no harm, and will live up to that expectation. Anyone providing an illegal abortion will face legal action. You stupidly act like every law breaker in the world will be proscecuted, when you know that is never the case. As for abortions (legal) causing harm to a woman, that is still the case today. Planned Parenthood has been the cause of many damaged uteruses, caused many to become infertile, and has caused deaths due to their so-called \"safe abortions.\" The more cases there are the more chance for damage and death.\n\n Doctors will be given the liberty to follow their conscience in their practice rather than being under the thumbs of fascist dictators who hate women.\n \nWomen who abort may not always nor immediately suffer, but they will in time. It is ironic that abortion is sold as a way to relieve women from harmful conseqences and billed as something which never harms women, while it hurts every woman, child and family it touches.\n\n Utterly false assumptions and your personal opinion only. Your opinions should not hold the force of law over others. You are a fascist and that is unacceptable in America.\n \nPhysicians know and believe that life begins at conception. Many testified before congress....\n\n Noneense. There is no agreement on this.\n \nIn the words of Dr. Lejeune: \"Each of us has a very precise starting moment which is the time at which the whole necessary and sufficient genetic information is gathered inside one cell, the fertilized egg, and this is the moment of fertilization. There is not the slightest doubt about that and we know that this information is written on a kind of ribbon which we call the DNA...Nature has used the smallest possible language to carry the information from father to children, from mother to children, from generation to generation...At no time is the human being a blob of protoplasm. As far as your nature is concerned, I see no difference between the early person that you were at conception and the late person which you are now. You were and are a human being.\"\n\n That is the opinion of one person and one person only. The opinion of such a person should not have the force of law to rule over others.\n \nThis is an excerpt from a thouroughly researched and thought out argument against Roe. If any of you are interested in actual facts: \n Recall the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision, which declared that slavery could not be prohibited by Congress in any territory of the U.S. and that African Americans were not full persons and not afforded the same rights as \"full persons.\" Sound familiar? President Lincoln argued that the slaves were persons, not possessions, and that their unalienable right to liberty was protected by the Declaration of Independence unborn. To add to the irony, after the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, came the Thirteenth (1865) and Fourteenth (1868) Amendments, all which overthrew slavery and the erroneous Dred Scott Supreme Court decision. The Fourteenth Amendment...how ironic. One of the Amendments which helped overturn Dred Scott is now used to further the \"non-person\" argument -the same argument the Amendment was created to prevent! How can the Supreme Court use the Fourteenth Amendment to help justify denying the unborn unalienable rights when this Amendment was supposed to protect people from such selective rights attribution?Roe V Wade - The Unconstitutional Decision\n\n No.",

   "You misunderstood my stance. I do not view a fetus/baby as being a human being only once it is born. Since the critical development in my view is the onset of mental existence and this can start to happen around the beginning of the third trimester, then I would say that we could start calling the fetus a human being with rights around the beginning of the third trimester. That is also precisely why I had already stated that I would support limiting third trimester abortion rights to a limited number of exceptions.\n \n This point was not chosen arbitrarily. I view the very essence of our existence as people as being our mental existence. It is a core philosophical concept that applies both to the beginning and to the end of life. We start our lives as people at the onset of mental existence and end our lives as people once that mental existence disappears (due to severe brain damage, etc.). Throughout Christian history, similar concepts have been discussed relating to ensoulment or different versions of souls - all resulting from the same thought process that it is the mentality that inhabits the body that is important, not just the body itself.\n \n By the way, in this discussion, I use the term \"human being\" as being the same as the term \"person\" - where these terms are equated in various definitions. Other definitions of \"a human\" are more biological, but it is the concept of \"person\" that most relates to the abortion debate.\n \n (Note: I may not be able to respond for a while since I will be travelling for a couple of weeks.)\n\n \n I think you are confusing 'person' a legal term with 'human being' a biological term.\n \n I am also taking leave of this forum for a while, it is Christmas Eve here and then there is so much to do until the new year.",

Why are you willing to have YOUR truth become THE truth for all pregnant women?emoticon_mad\n\n For the same reason that YOU are willing to have YOUR truth become THE truth for all pregnant women and fetuses. Perhaps it has escaped your notice, but we are living in a democracy, not a dictatorship. In Democracies, people DO have opinions on various issues and vote accordingly. The Constitution does protect the populace from the temporary fads or illogic of the populace by setting certain limits. Where fetal vs women's rights are concerned, the Constitution was not sufficiently precise, which has led to a lot of back-and-forth about abortion rights. Roe vs Wade is the current standard for the limits of restrictions on abortion rights but even Roe vs Wade allows the state to interfere in the third trimester. The reason Roe vs Wade gives is viability since, at the time, there was insufficient evidence or concensus to make any conclusions about the \"personhood\" question, so it left that question open. The personhood question is one of the questions that we are debating here.\n \n Either way, your accusation is bogus and illogical. Not only are you not on legal ground in claiming that abortions should be legal always for all reasons, but also only 10% of Americans share your opinion. In a Democracy, that means that you have no reasonable ground to stand on and any accusation of others overstepping their mandate by expressing their opinion rings hollow when your view represents such an extreme minority.",

   "Maybe, but even with the republicans holding office for so long and now with the democrat rule the idea seems even more unlikely.\n\n Yes and no. Abortion rights will continue to be safe through the Obama administration. However, most of the justices that support abortion rights are much older than those that don't. Some might retire during the Obama administration, essentially assuring the introduction of other justices of similar political / judicial persuasion, but some might hang on until they want to retire for reasons independent of politics. Meanwhile, the justices that would decide against Roe vs Wade are bound to hang on for quite some time simply because of their relative youth (50s and 60s being young where justices are concerned). So, taking the long view, I don't think we can count on Roe vs Wade being safe for decades to come - only years.\n \nHmmm, I'm curious, i like the way you think :) What would be your idea of a compromise though?\n\n One idea of compromise would be to more clearly legally outline restrictions on third trimester abortions to outlaw third trimester abortions apart from certain agreed upon exceptions. Roe vs Wade already allows this but stated the health exception too vaguely. The health exception would have to be more clearly defined. Hopefully, clearly defined third trimester restrictions would draw enough supporters away from the pro-life side that, as in the UK, that limit would stay at the beginning of the third trimester and not have major risks of being pulled farther back. \n \n However, it still might be possible that, even with clear third trimester restrictions, the pro-life side might still be strong enough to risk derailing all abortion rights. Then, in that dire scenario, a compromise limiting fully open abortion rights to first trimester only (as is the case for most of Europe) would have to be acceptable. If that happened, then I personally would grudgingly agree to such a compromise, but would continue to support political groups and parties which would try to push the limit back to the begining of the third trimester, and would continue to debate the topic in the hopes of changing any minds I can.\n \n Note: a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll from 2003 (the latest that asked such question) had 84% of people in support of third trimester restrictions, ~2/3rds of people in support of second trimester restrictions, and ~2/3rds of people saying that first trimester abortions should be generally legal (only ~30% thinking otherwise).

You completely ignore any rights of the fetus. In your view, if the woman wanted to, she could abort the fetus one day before birth (if I am wrong about you having no objections to this, then please state otherwise). That blindness to the fate of the late term fetus is what keeps you isolated to a minority opinion of ~10% of Americans. Most people are not as blind as you are to the fate of the fetus and, instead, try to strike some balance between the two - where there is a clear preference for late term fetuses over early term fetuses and, where exceptions are concerned, even the great majority of pro-life proponents support abortion rights for risk to mother's life, and rape and incest. \n \nOnce again, this is an area where the law must needs be silent.\n \n No, AO, that's not an opinion on abortion; rather, it's a position on the legitimate reach of the law.\n \n Why are you restrictionists so afraid to trust women to make decisions in their own interest?\n \n Conversely, why are you so eager to impose your view on women who might not share it?\n\n There are a wide range of women - some give full thought to their decisions, others make decisions purely on selfish motives with no thought to other considerations. The same is true for all people of all ages, sexes and nationalities. If all people were good and wise, then we wouldn't need any laws. Laws exist because people make decisions which are sufficiently harmful to others or to society that the state needs to intercede. This is also true for the case of abortion.

In the past, people believed that they had an unquestioned right in being able to treat their children however they wanted to - ranging from heavy physical abuse to, in very ancient times, infanticide. This was once considered a right but later political theory allowed the state to interfere in such private behavior out of consideration of the rights of the child. Similarly, I fully realize that you don't acknowledge that the fetus has any rights ever (just as, in ancient times, people did not aknowledge any rights of children) - so, in your opinion, the woman has 100% rights and the fetus has 0% rights. You have the right to that opinion but it is very much a minority opinion, even among those on the pro-choice side. \n \n So, if there is a balance to be made between the rights of the woman and the rights of the fetus, the main debate then rests in how to make that balance. There are a wide range of opinions on when, during the pregnancy, to set the limit for unquestioned abortion rights and which exceptions to include once the restrictions set in. Yours represents only one minority opinion of abortion never being restricted. The absolute pro-life side (that never allows abortion) represents a similar small minority extreme opinion on the opposite end.

Just because you choose to ignore the other considerations does not mean that they do not exist. Even legally, Roe vs Wade allowed for state interference in the third trimester.

However, if you have general questions, then those are perfectly valid to answer.\n \nIf someone is going to take that position, the least that I would expect is that they would tell the world whether, for example, they favor capital punishment for those convicted of murdering a born person.\n \n For the record, to use your example, would you favor the death penalty for those women who aborted their fetuses on a \"whim\" one day prior to delivery?\n\n You posed the same questions to me on an earlier thread and I already answered, but I will answer them here again...\n No, I don't favor the death penalty for women who abort their fetuses on a \"whim\" one day prior to delivery.\n \nDo you feel that is the legal equivalent of the murder of a born person?\n\n No\n \nLet's be specific, I have 3 daughters of childbearing age and one granddaughter who soon will be.\n \n If, in a hypothetical situation, any of them were to abort their fetuses on what you would consider a \"whim\" one day prior to delivery, just what penalty would you have the law exact on them?\n\n Either jail time (say, a year or two), a large fine (withdrawn from the first years of their working life, not paid by their parents), or large amount of community service, depending on their circumstances (ex. less penalty for first offenders, for those who are younger, etc.) Those are just initial thoughts, not firm policy since, once again, as a voter (not a politician), it is not my responsibility nor my expertise to iron out all the details. That is the responsibility of those who are expert in criminal law and the politicians they advise. If I were in their position, I would look at the laws and consequences that exist in Western European countries with similar laws, as well as the types of exceptions and considerations made for people's circumstances (ex. if they already have kids to support, if they are first time offenders, etc.). Also, I would support punishing the doctor performing the operation. Once again, as a voter, my only responsibility is to bring up general directions. Anyone, such as yourself, who expects a full proposal is seriously delusional. \n \nI also find it ironic that you would accuse me, a retired lawyer and law teacher, of being ignorant of either the law or its processes.\n\n Then do you deny that Roe vs Wade allows for state interference in the third trimester? How about the idea that during the founding and for the first century of the US, abortion was only freely allowed up to \"quickening\" - do you deny that? If not, then what specifically are you denying in reference to the legal aspects I mentioned?",

Again, if you had bothered to read my earlier posts, you would have noticed that I did include exceptions to third trimester abortion restrictions - including for risk to mother's life, significant risk to her health, etc. Obviously, that means that I believe that there are legitimate reasons for late term abortions.

Where abortions are concerned, if there was a third trimester abortion done by a doctor (under this third trimester abortion restriction scenario) for reasons other than reasons that are accepted by popular vote through the political process (ex. risk to mother's life, health, etc.), then the doctor should get punished, as well as the woman (depending on her circumstances).

The imposition of punishments is a second and independent step to the idea that something should be legal or illegal. The only reason not to debate the first step on its own (i.e. whether or when to impose limits) is if no execution of such a law would be possible. That is not the case. You still have not made the point of why one would need to go into the details of punishment before one makes a consensus of what it would be that one would be punishing for. \n \n As for the two examples you brought up of people's proposed punishments, those are the type of gut reactions that you would expect from people that I was hesitant in giving since gut reactions are rarely well thought out. For example, a $5k fine for a doctor is negligible compared to what he makes in a year and will hardly serve as a deterent, as will $2.5k for a woman of reasonable means, while $2.5k might be utterly unaffordable for someone who is barely surviving from paycheck to paycheck or living on welfare. The life sentences imposed on a woman with a family would cause much more harm than good. I already mentioned my gut reaction solution in an earlier post \"Either jail time (say, a year or two), a large fine (withdrawn from the first years of their working life, not paid by their parents), or large amount of community service, depending on their circumstances (ex. less penalty for first offenders, for those who are younger, etc.)\". At least I had the honesty to say that these are initial thoughts and that, since I am not an expert, full decisions on punishment would have to be taken up by those that are. The only general statement I will make is that any punishment should be harsh enough to serve as a deterent, but not so harsh as to stop the person from continuing some level of normal life (though not necessarily as good as if it were blemish-free), and which should take into account extenuating circumstances - ex. family to support, first time offender, age of offender, mental state, etc.\n \n So, you have not given examples of people who have given full thought to the type of details you asked for but of people who have given you gut reactions out of pressure. Fine, I already gave you the same gut reactions. If you want more detail than that, then show me an example of someone who gave you more detail.",

That is as naive as to say that nobody is capable of being irresponsible. We know from everyday experience that there is a wide range of responsibility of actions.

Secondly, I know you deny this, but there is a sentient human that can now feel, suffer, experience pain and emotions that most Americans feel the need to protect but that you apparently don't. Killing such a late term fetus thus does carry negative consequences that need to be balanced with good reasons.\n \n Who decides on the reasons acceptable for late term abortions?

   "Now you have to explain how you get from A to B in your last sentence.\n\n You claim that all women are responsible in their decision about abortion. That either means that you think them incapable of being irresponsible or that they never choose to be irresponsible. The great majority of the time when I see an \"all\" in people's statements of human behavior, it is because they are making sweeping generalities and are too naive or simplistic in their thought process to think that exceptions could occur. How else do you explain your comment that ALL women act responsibly.\n \nOnce again, you fail to provide any definition whatsoever of the word \"irresponsibly\". What does the word mean to you? What standards will you use? Who should make this determination?\n\n I have already answered that but will answer it once again - please pay attention:\n \n ***Chester's Question***: What does the word mean to you?\n \n ***Another Opinion's Answer***: That means that they should not get abortions in the third trimester unless there is a compelling reason that is critical enough to counter the right's to life of the now mentally existing late term fetus. These reasons include risk to mother's life, significant risk to her health, significantly deformed fetus, rape, incest - plus any other exceptions that people might think up that could be successfully debated in a forum such as this. The standards used are a balance of rights of the mother with rights of the fetus.\n \n ***Chester's Question*** : Who should make this determination?\n \n ***Another opinion's Answer*** : The usual people who make the determination in a Democracy - the legislators who are elected by the public, limited by the rights outlined in the Constitution and judicial precedent. In specific cases, if legality is questioned, then judges decide.\n \n If you ask me these questions again, I will just keep quoting these answers until you stop repeating yourself.\n \nAs to your two points later on, those are matters for HER and her alone to decide. If she believes the negative consequences outweigh the positive ones, she has the choice to refrain from terminating her pregnancy.\n \n If she believes the fetus feels pain, then she should act accordingly. In both cases, she has the right to make that determination without the coercive force of the law.\n\n That is only the opinion of you and ~10% of other Americans. The rest of us believe that a balance needs to be made and don't share your opinion.\n \nSoftball question. Because, with our privacy fast disappearing, this remains perhaps the most intimate of choices, and it must be so in order to preserve whatever shred of privacy remains to an individual.\n\n Yes, privacy is important, but so is life of persons. You are blind to any rights that a late term fetus might have. Indeed, a fetus one day before birth has roughly the same characteristics as a baby one day after birth. Are you as blind to the fate of the baby one day after birth as you are to the fate of the fetus one day before birth? If someone were to kill the one day old baby, would you also characterize people's reaction as ICK?\n \nOnce again a false dichotomy. Lincoln gave the correct response to a heckler who posed one of these to him. He said, \"Why do you suppose that, because I do not want a black woman as my slave that I would want her for my wife?\"\n\n That answer makes no sense given the statements I quoted. How does it relate? It seems a complete non-sequitor.\n \nYou STILL don't get it, do you? IT'S NOT MY CALL!!! \n \n If a woman cares to give credence to the \"competing issues\", I will give her my full support. If another woman chooses otherwise, I will give that woman my full support also. \n \n In either case, it's HER call to make, not mine, not yours, not society's, and most assuredly not the law's.\n\n A basic idea that is being debated in this forum is when rights start to exist. You claim that the fetus has no rights by claiming 100% rights for the woman. If you make such a claim, then you need to defend it. WHY doesn't the fetus have rights? Since the great majority of people DO view the late term fetus as worth defending, you will get nowhere in convincing them if you do not address this point.",

It is not an argument for or against abortion at all, but rather an argument for or against allowing the law to finalize and dictate our reproductive rights, whatever they may be.\n\n The law, in the form of Roe vs Wade already allows for limits imposed on abortion rights by the state for the sake of the fetus in the third trimester - giving viability as the reason. There are still questions about the health exception and in what situations that applies, but that does not change the fact that legal structures are already in place for the state having some say in abortion rights. \n \n In the ideal world, if we could decide on a law and it would stick, then I would choose third trimester restrictions just from principle's sake since I do view fetal rights as needing to be balanced in in late term.\n \n However, we do not live in the ideal world. What is the state of the world (US in this case), then, where abortion rights are concerned? The state is that the balance of justices on the Supreme Court is still in favor of Roe vs Wade but just barely. Though safe during the Obama administration, the scale could just tip the other way in a future administration. This is because of the strength of the pro-life movement. However, if you take away their use of third trimester abortions as a tool to advertise against all abortions, then you are taking away much of the strength of their message and weakening the movement - hopefully, enough to keep the rest of abortions safe, as seemed to be the case in the UK after they largely restricted third trimester abortions. So, even from a real world politics point of view, third trimester abortion restrictions seem to make sense.\n \n One more thing to note: In a Democracy such as ours, if the majority is large enough, then the whole Constitution could be rewritten via a new Constitutional Convention. Given current politics, that is extremely unlikely, but the calling of a new Constitution is built into our political system as an option.

One of the mayors of the town turned a woman in to the Gestapo for her criticism of the swastika, a \"crime\" for which she was jailed two years. Also, she found, a bishop at a local church had authorized the blessing of Nazi banners at the altar of the sanctuary....\n \n Rosmus discovered that nearly two thousand Soviet prisoners of war in Passau were killed just before the end of World War II. What is even more frightening is that these soldiers were released from their camps, but then hunted down and killed by local townspeople, who were ordinary Passauers. Rosmus reports that \"They had to dig their own graves and then they were shot. In some cases their genitals were cut off, their eyes gouged out, and their tongues were cut off.\"...\n \n Rosmus also tells a different, although equally horrible tale in the same book, which describes how Eastern European laborers were forced to have abortions, a plan which was orchestrated by the Nazi Party in Passau. Rosmus found that a doctor in the town, Dr. Franz Maria Clarenz, reportedly performed over five hundred illegal abortions on these workers. She came to the understanding that most of the abortions were conducted without the consent of the mothers, who were second-class citizens in Germany. Most of the abortions were done without anesthesia and some were even performed in the seventh or eighth month of pregnancy. ... \n \n Anna Rosmus: Uncovering the Past\n \n So much for sanctity of life!",

The above were examples of my opinions, but would i stand to make them universal law?, on further examination of the question i would say no.\n It was the question of making our opinions law that Chester was trying to have discussed, not the actual opinions themselves. Sorry if i have confused you.\n\n I understand your point of view of not thinking that all ones opinions should be made law. There are many opinions I also hold that I also would not make law since it is quite clear that there can be a wide range of opinions and approaches to a wide array of subjects, where one cannot say that one approach is the right one.\n \n However, in a Democracy, we the people need to set some directions in what we expect from our government in terms of laws and we cannot shirk those responsibilities completely. There are some issues that one eventually does need to make a stand on. Murder of born people, for example, is an issue that most would agree should be controlled by law. Then, I would think that most would consider that the question \"Would you stand to make this opinion against murder of born people universal law?\" should be answered YES! Sometimes, the answer to that question needs to be yes if we are to have any laws at all. How does one decide, then, which opinions to apply as universal laws (in our voting habits, responses to polls, or any other civic activity)? That can be a tough question but it seems that most of the rhethoric I hear concerning laws are questions of balancing rights and responsibilities. \n \n There is no one answer to how one strikes these balances but to fail to present an opinion about law is just to abdicate responsibility purely to a party one votes for that one blindly trusts to get it right. I don't know about you, but I think that there are very few politicians that fully think these ethical issues through. The age of the politician / philosopher is over and many, if not most, politicians can have as knee-jerk reactions as many in the public have. That is why debate is so important in a society. I, for one, do not blindly trust my politicians on ethical issues. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lack of genuine open-minded debate on these issues in the grander public sphere (ex. no televised debates about abortion rights between experts who know both sides of the issue fully, where they actually listen to each other). Therefore, the only place seemingly left for actual discussion on these topics is forums such as this. I feel that it is part of our civic duty as citizens of a Democracy to engage in such debates and act on their conclusions in the form of our voting habits, responses to polls, letters to our representatives, or any other form of civic activity that gets us actually INVOLVED in our democracy instead of being complacent and apathetic about it. \n \n So, my bottom line is that, if you hold your view strongly enough, have a strong foundation of rational support behind it, and it doesn't interfere with major rights granted us in the Constitution, then you have every right to think that your view should become law and play your part in supporting that view through your voting habits, civic activity and expressions in forums such as this. Nobody has the rational right to tell you otherwise. After all, in a Democracy, if the people (and you as part of \"the people\") do not have a right to shape the direction of the laws that are imposed on them (through the choices they make in their voting habits, etc.), then who does?

At least I had the honesty to say that these are initial thoughts and that, since I am not an expert, full decisions on punishment would have to be taken up by those that are. The only general statement I will make is that any punishment should be harsh enough to serve as a deterent, but not so harsh as to stop the person from continuing some level of normal life (though not necessarily as good as if it were blemish-free), and which should take into account extenuating circumstances - ex. family to support, first time offender, age of offender, mental state, etc.\n\n You are not going to get any more detailed answer from me and it is doubtful that anyone else will give you any more of a detailed answer since nobody has given you a highly detailed answer up to now on any subject, not just abortion. Any further expectations from you would simply be unreasonable dillusion on your part. Indeed, your repetition of this question over and over again is wasting this forum's time. Unless you can show ANYONE who EVER gave you the type of detail you expect, then I will leave it as dillusional expectations on your part and not respond to future posts on this particular subject.",

And it still misses the point, in my opinion, because I don't go with the idea that it is ok to do something evil to accomplish a good.\n\n I can't really speak to the details of the consequences at the time of the illegality of abortion before Roe vs Wade since I was a kid when it came into being. I certainly have heard of the back-alley abortions and have read about various cases where such abortions occurred and resulted in severe injury or death so one cannot discount it entirely. However, I do not have the statistics on hand to state how prevalent such back-alley abortions were and how often they resulted in severe medical problems so I will not respond there. \n \n However, the book Freakonomics made a reasonable case using statistics to show how the introduction of abortion rights helped reduce future crime rate (< 15 years down the road) since there were far fewer unwanted children in poor families whose unfortunate family situation helped lead them to a life of crime once they reached peak crime years (teenage and 20s). So, outside of the effect on the individual live's of the women involved, that reduction in crime is one positive effect that the introduction of abortion rights had on society.\n \n Either way, as you say, one should not do something evil to do something good.
