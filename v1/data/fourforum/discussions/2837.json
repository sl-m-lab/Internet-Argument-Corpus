A bit of a contradiction when ya think about it!\n \n \n One or two in particular seem to have more of an obsession with male gay sex. They don't seem interested in how we live our lives, only what we do in bed. That leads me to be a little suspicious that they are not comfortable with their own sexuality, maybe they have feelings they are scared of.....\n \n It also seems when this has been suggested to them, they scream how sick it is......I agree with Billy Shakespere. \"Me thinks one protest too much\"",

Amazing insight.\n\n \n I have boiled every argument you and others have given me down to those three factors. You have yet to disprove that they are. Your inability to do this yet come back with such a weak post says far more then you are willing admit about yourself and your debating style. I CHALLENGE YOU AGAIN, give me anti-arguments and I WILL BOIL EACH AND EVERY ONE DOWN TO MAJORITY OPPRESSION, LIES AND FALLACIES. Of course, you're going to ignore this challenge. \n \n \nThe lies are coming from a minority that want to do away with the traditional family (the backbone of a strong society) and put in place values and moral iniquity that will ultimately lead to the downfall of this society.\n\n \n Right. Just like letting blacks marry was so bad. Just like giving women right to vote was. Just like letting interracial marriage was. Not only are your arguments weak, but your historical knowledge is also fundementally weak. You do realize that straights have litterally killed marriage right? The number of single parents and unwed parents has skyrocketed in the past decade. Explain how you aren't arguing aganist that. \n \n \nFallacies? Hardly. Look at some of the great empires of the past and there downfall came after these things came to past. Majority oppression? The majority doesn't want rampant lawlessness to be allowed in our societal institutions.\n\n \n Name one. If you can. But I know you can't, so you minus well ignore this. I am taunting you for a reason, to get you to put up or shut up. Lawlessness? What are you talking about? This country is run by the minority, elected by the minority. LESS THEN 50% OF THE COUNTRY VOTES, by mere numbers, the President is a MINORITY president. Besides, pure majority enforces lawlessness. Democracy is mob rule by definition. IF we had majority oppression, there would be NO minority rights. Women couldn't vote. Blacks couldn't get married. Minorities would litterally be 2nd or 3rd class citizens. The majority argument is a fallacy as well. The majority only proves that the majority believes it to be correct, it does not prove it is. Besides, history is fraught with thousands, if not millions of examples of where the majority went horribly wrong. \n \n \n\n So, who has the problem admitting their opinions are based on falsehoods? Hmmm.\n\n \n Obviously you. You can't rise to the challenege or prove that your arguments AREN'T fallacies. \n \n Here's some advice: Stop using fallacies that are disproven. \n Hint: Stop using the natural fallacy, stop using the disease fallacy, stop using the \"downfall of society\" fallacy, and stop using stastics known to be lies. that will buy you far more crediblitiy.",

You have the right to spread your venemous hate here, offering nothing constructive, so obviously wrongdoing does have rights.\n \n \nStealing can never be a right. Adultery can never be a right. Nor can sodomy. Virtue has rights; vice does not. emoticon_ic\n\n \n The Taliban regime in Afghanistan had state enforcers of virtue and against vice too. What makes being gay a vice? I can't think of anything. What is the connection to stealing or to adultery?",

   "Population control emoticon_xhoho Good idea we need that emoticon_cool \n \n \n Yes I am straight. I am not putting you down for being gay just dont understand it emoticon_confused\n\n \n Tucker: you are more than allowed to not understand it. That's as honest as I've heard so far. My question would be to you, are you willing to listen to those who would be glad to enlighten you? \n \n I don't quite understand right-handed people, but I at least accept them and know that they are in the majority.\n The same goes for people who pick their noses in public, but the cool part is that I don't have to watch. \n \n Homosexuals just are. The arguments as to their validity or otherwise are all quite moot. They are, they alway have been and always will be. They are in no way unable to reproduce, not to meantion that many actually do. \n This would also extend to the fact that not all heterosexual encounters, let alone marriages result in offspring, and that not all offspring are created within a marriage. This doesn't even begin to touch on the multitude of factors which create single parent families. (Death, divorce, never marrying...etc) \n This just puts a huge hole in the idea that marriage is for procreation. But those who are against homosexual marriages will always come up with some lame excuse as to why those factors are not of issue. \n \n Then there is the claim that God never intended for gays to be let alone to marry and actually attempt to claim that somehow gays are a mistake. \n Well if this were true then no one would be born left handed, red-haired, Albino, or with any form of birth defect. \n \n I always love to laugh at the argument that if God intended for everyone to be gay it would only make the human species cease to exist. \n Funny how gays actually do reproduce and therefore contintue the species just fine. \n Again, not to mention the fact that not all heterosexuals are able to reproduce and hence those marriages or intertwinings would be against nature, but no one ever mentions that fact. \n \n Of course there is always the standard fall back to the Bible and what it does or doesn't say about being gay. \n What I have yet to hear here is the fact that the word \"Homosexual\" was only coined back in 1800 and therefore its impossible that the Bible says anything in the original texts about homosexuals or homosexuality. \n Indeed it mentions many things about prostitution and child molestation. But please remember, the Bible also encourages slavery and promotes the idea that the world is flat, as well as the center of the universe. \n All of those things have either been disproven or society has corrected it's views on inhumane treatment of fellow human beings.\n Ah, but it's still ok to treat Homosexuals as less than human? To insult, deny rights, beat and even murder them? \n \n This leads me to the popular idea that homosexuality is somehow a choice. Why on earth would anyone Choose to be the victim of such abuse? I just can't phathom it. \n And trust me, I never made such a choice. \n \n The only choice I ever made was to stop attempting to live as society prescribed and to finally be honest.",

   "The homosexual condition is a disorder, and homosexual acts are grave moral aberrations.\n\n \n According to you who bases his arguments on a book that is simply good fiction with no chance of validation. Would you like me basing my arguments out of straight fiction? How about lord of the rings? Perhaps Star Wars? Maybe Harry Potter? h\n \n [quote]\n Those in a homosexual relationship do not have a \"right\" to have that relationship enforced in law.[/qiote]\n \n Because you say so. I say the moon is made of cheese. Your point is? \n \n \nWrongdoing and sin do not have rights.\n\n \n Therefore, I say you do not have any rights. emoticon_xgood \n \n \n\n Stealing can never be a right. Adultery can never be a right. Nor can sodomy. Virtue has rights; vice does not. emoticon_ic\n\n \n Right....so is stealing from someone else who stole wrong? Adultery is biologically built into to almost every male of almost every species, ignorance of biology doesn't make you right. Sodomy...according to you. \n \n Virtue and vice are defined by the arrogant who assume they are morally correct without even understanding that morals, vice and virtue change constantly.",
