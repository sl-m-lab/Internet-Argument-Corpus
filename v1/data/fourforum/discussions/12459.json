   "Mexico's Drug War: Mexico drug cartels' new weaponry means war - Los Angeles Times\n \n \nNarcotics traffickers are acquiring firepower more appropriate to an army -- including grenade launchers and antitank rockets -- and the police are feeling outgunned.\n \n Reporting from Zihuatanejo, Mexico, and Mexico City -- It was a brazen assault, not just because it targeted the city's police station, but for the choice of weapon: grenades.\n \n The Feb. 21 attack on police headquarters in coastal Zihuatanejo, which injured four people, fit a disturbing trend of Mexico's drug wars. Traffickers have escalated their arms race, acquiring military-grade weapons, including hand grenades, grenade launchers, armor-piercing munitions and antitank rockets with firepower far beyond the assault rifles and pistols that have dominated their arsenals.\n \n Most of these weapons are being smuggled from Central American countries or by sea, eluding U.S. and Mexican monitors who are focused on the smuggling of semiauto- matic and conventional weapons purchased from dealers in the U.S. border states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.\n \n The proliferation of heavier armaments points to a menacing new stage in the Mexican government's 2-year-old war against drug organizations, which are evolving into a more militarized force prepared to take on Mexican army troops, deployed by the thousands, as well as to attack each other.\n \n These groups appear to be taking advantage of a robust global black market and porous borders, especially between Mexico and Guatemala. Some of the weapons are left over from the wars that the United States helped fight in Central America, U.S. officials said.\n \n \"There is an arms race between the cartels,\" said Alberto Islas, a security consultant who advises the Mexican government.\n \n \"One group gets rocket-propelled grenades, the other has to have them.\"\n \n There are even more ominous developments: Authorities reported three thefts of several hundred pounds of blasting material from industrial explosives plants in Durango during a four-day period last month. Authorities believe the material may have been destined for car bombs or remotely detonated roadside devices, which have been used with devastating effect in Iraq, killing more than 1,822 members of U.S.-led forces since the war there began nearly six years ago.\n \n The Mexican army has recovered most of the material, and there has been no reported use of such devices.\n \n Grenades or military-grade weapons have been reported in at least 10 Mexican states during the last six months, used against police headquarters, city halls, a U.S. consulate, TV stations and senior Mexican officials. In a three-week period ended March 6, five grenade attacks were launched on police patrols and stations and the home of a commander in the south-central state of Michoacan. Other such attacks occurred in five other states during the same period.\n \n At least one grenade attack north of the border, at a Texas nightclub frequented by U.S. police officers, has been tied to Mexican traffickers.\n \n How many weapons have been smuggled into Mexico from Central America is not known, and the military-grade munitions are still a small fraction of the larger arsenal in the hands of narcotics traffickers. Mexican officials continue to push Washington to stem the well-documented flow of conventional weapons from the United States, as Congress holds hearings on the role those smuggled guns play in arming Mexican drug cartels.\n \n There is no comprehensive data on how many people have been killed by heavier weapons.\n \n But four days after the assault on the Zihuatanejo police station, four of the city's officers were slain in a highway ambush six miles from town on the road to Acapulco. In addition to the standard AK-47 and AR-15 assault rifles, the attackers fired at least six .50-caliber shells into the officers' pickup. The vehicle blew up when hit by what experts believe was a grenade or explosive projectile. The bodies of the officers were charred.\n \n \"These are really weapons of war,\" said Alberto Fernandez, spokesman for the Zihuatanejo city government. \"We only know these devices from war movies.\"\n \n U.S. law enforcement officials say they detected the smuggling of grenades and other military-grade equipment into Mexico about a year and a half ago, and observed a sharp uptick in the use of the weapons about six months ago.\n \n The Mexican government said it has seized 2,239 grenades in the last two years, in contrast to 59 seized over the previous two years.\n \n The enhanced weaponry represents a wide sampling from the international arms bazaar, with grenades and launchers produced by U.S., South Korean, Israeli, Spanish or former Soviet bloc manufacturers. Many had been sold legally to governments, including Mexico's, and then were diverted onto the black market. Some may be sold directly to the traffickers by corrupt elements of national armies, authorities and experts say.\n \n The single deadliest attack on civilians by drug traffickers in Mexico took place Sept. 15 at an Independence Day celebration in the central plaza of Morelia, hometown of President Felipe Calderon and capital of Michoacan. Attackers hurled fragmentation grenades at the celebrating crowd, killing eight people and wounding dozens more.\n \n Amid the recent spate of attacks in Michoacan, federal police on Feb. 20 announced the discovery of 66 fragmentation grenades in the fake bottom of a truck intercepted in southern Mexico, just over the border from Guatemala. The two men arrested with the cargo told police they were transporting the grenades to Morelia.\n \n Grenades used in three attacks in Monterrey and Texas were linked to a single Monterrey warehouse, packed with explosives and high-caliber guns, reportedly belonging to the Gulf cartel. Mexican authorities raided the warehouse in October and seized the cache, which contained South Korean-manufactured grenades similar to the American M67 fragmentation grenade.\n \n Grenades from the same lot were used in a Jan. 6 attack on the Televisa television station in Monterrey, which caused damage but no injuries, and during an Oct. 12 attack against the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey. The device at the consulate did not detonate.\n \n Late on the night of Jan. 31, a Saturday, a man tossed a grenade into the El Booty Lounge in Pharr, Texas. Three off-duty Texas police officers were there, though authorities would not say whether they were the target. The explosive, which did not detonate, was traced to the Monterrey warehouse.\n \n Traffickers using M203 40-millimeter grenade launchers last year attacked and killed eight Mexican federal police officers in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state. In the northern border city of Nogales, the Sonora state police commander was killed Nov. 2 in an ambush by purported traffickers firing AK-47s and lobbing grenades. He had been returning from a meeting with U.S. authorities in Arizona to discuss gun smuggling.\n \n In the western state of Durango, three people, including a 3-year-old child, were killed in a grenade attack in January.\n \n The firepower has gone beyond grenades. Armed with light antitank weapons, would-be assassins went after the nation's top counternarcotics prosecutor in December 2007. The assailants were intercepted before they reached Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos, who was not hurt. The weapons seized were linked to the notorious Sinaloa cartel.\n \n \"They were betting on being able to escalate with a spectacular strike precisely to terrify society,\" Santiago Vasconcelos said at the time. (He was killed in November in a plane crash.)\n \n Beyond the weaponry, drug gangs for several years have demonstrated the ability to form squads and employ military tactics, including the use of assault rifles, hand grenades, grenade launchers and fully automatic weapons to pin down army forces. This has enabled them to attack army patrols frontally, as they did with lethal results Feb. 7 in the central state of Zacatecas, killing one sergeant and critically wounding a colonel.\n \n \"At this stage, the drug cartels are using basic infantry weaponry to counter government forces,\" a U.S. government official in Mexico said. \"Encountering criminals with this kind of weaponry is a horse of a different color,\" the official said.\n \n \"It's not your typical patrol stop, where someone pulls a gun. This has all the makings of an infantry squad, or guerrilla fighting.\"\n \n The fear of guerrilla warfare was compounded in February when 270 pounds of dynamite and several hundred electric detonators were stolen from a U.S. firm in the state of Durango. On Valentine's Day, about 20 masked gunmen, led by a heavyset man wearing gold rings and chains, stormed the warehouse of a subsidiary of Austin Powder Co., an industrial explosives manufacturer, according to official accounts. They overpowered guards and emptied the warehouse. Two similar thefts were reported within four days in the same area.\n \n Although the Mexican army recovered most of the dynamite, the incident augurs an even bloodier trend, officials said.\n \n \"There is only one reason to have bulk explosives,\" said Thomas G. Mangan, spokesman in Phoenix for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \"An improvised explosive device. A car bomb.\"\n \n In addition to grenades, high-powered guns such as the .50-caliber Barrett sniper rifle have become a weapon of choice in narcotics traffickers' arsenals, Mangan said. Unlike grenades and antitank weapons, the .50-caliber guns can be obtained by ordinary citizens in the U.S. and smuggled easily into Mexico, like the tons of assault rifles and automatic pistols.\n \n Mexican law enforcement, such as the police in Zihuatanejo, is grossly outgunned. Officers have protested, seeking better protective gear, weaponry and pay.\n \n Shortly after the Zihuatanejo attacks, police officers staged a brief work stoppage outside their headquarters, where scars from the grenade attack were still visible. One of the blasts left a cereal bowl-shaped divot in the stone pavement and pockmarks on the front of the police building. It went off 100 feet from the nearest street, prompting some officers to suspect that the assailants employed a grenade launcher.\n \n Police have piled sandbags 4 feet high around the compound and security is tight. Commanders have bought 10 bulletproof vests, but say they need at least 280 to equip the city's 343 officers.\n \n The police commander, Pablo Rodriguez, said his officers are terrified. They are armed with semiautomatic .223-caliber rifles made in Italy, Germany and Mexico. The rifles, with folding stocks, are snazzy, but they are no match for the weapons being stockpiled by the drug cartels.\n \n \"They are good weapons, but to counteract the types of weapons they're using against us, they're not equal,\" Rodriguez said.\n \n His officers know they don't stand a chance. Not five days after the highway attack that blew up the police truck, Rodriguez had jobs to fill. Twenty-two of his cops had abruptly quit.\n\n \n So, the news is now out on how the Mexican drug cartels are smuggling in weaponry from Central America and across the sea, how they're getting stuff that's been left over from wars long fought, and even how they're getting ahold of fully functional grenades, rocket launchers, and 40mm cannons.\n \n Show me one gun store along the border that's selling 40mm cannons to the public. Go ahead, show me the stores where these things are freely available and the FFL dealers are boldly flaunting the NFA and GCA laws as if they were misdemeanor offenses like jaywalking.",

   "Where do you get your figures from?\n \n First of all, I make zero excuses for these Inner City Drug Gang Slime balls, but the FBI's data is different than yours. \n   Murder Victims by Weapon, 2003-2007 \n2003 = 7,745 \n 2004 = 7,286 \n 2005 = 7,565 \n 2006 = 7,836 \n 2007 = 7,361\n\n \n High huh? But hey, Drugs are a victimless crime! \n \n However, if you are going to control crime you need to know who to concentrate your efforts on. You say it should be the law-abiding, we say it should be these guys.   Violence in America - Effective Solutions \n more than two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are involved with drug trafficking or have evidence of ante-mortem illicit drug use.\n \n Not only do the data show that acquaintance and domestic homicide are a minority of homicides,[26] but the FBI's definition of acquaintance and domestic homicide requires only that the murderer knew or was related to the decedent. That dueling drug dealers are acquainted does not make them \"friends.\" Over three-quarters of murderers have long histories of violence against not only their enemies and other \"acquaintances,\" but also against their relatives.\n \n The gun control advocacy literature from the \"medical community\" shows that fully two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are, in fact, drug dealers and their customers who wreak tremendous human and economic havoc upon society. In failing to account for this, the medical literature cannot and does not honestly assess these deaths.\" \n\n   FBI: Burgeoning gangs behind up to 80% of U.S. crime \n \n  Study done by the University of Tennessee Med school \nLooking only to official criminal records, data over the past thirty years consistently show that the mythology of murderers as ordinary citizens does not hold true. Studies have found that approximately 75% of murderers have adult criminal records, and that murderers average a prior adult criminal career of six years, including four major adult felony arrests. These studies also found that when the murder occurred [a]bout 11% of murder arrestees [were] actually on pre-trial release--that is, they were awaiting trial for another offense. \n \n The fact that only 75% of murderers have adult crime records should not be misunderstood as implying that the remaining 25% of murderers are non-criminals. The reason over half of those 25% of murderers don't have adult records is that they are juveniles. Thus, by definition they cannot have an adult criminal record. Juvenile criminal records might well show these murderers to have extensive serious criminal records. \n\n Drug dealers! How do you like your drugs now?",

   "Drugs are Killing our inner city residents.\n \n   CRIME: THE INNER-CITY CRISIS \n The problem of youth homicide is very heavily concentrated in black males aged 15-19.3\n For inner-city black teenagers, the homicide rate is astronomical. The huge rise in gun crime perpetrated by older urban teenagers has not been replicated in other areas. In the suburbs, where legal restrictions on guns are generally less severe, the mortality rate has stayed about the same.\n \n Gun control advocates sometimes convey the impression that current murder rates are dramatically higher than ever before. And if one looks at statistics for particular age groups, one finds a substantial rise in murder arrests. From 1985 to 1991, arrests of adults for murder declined, but arrests for murder of 17-year-old males rose 121%; arrests of 16-year-old males rose 158%; arrests of 15-year-old males rose 217%; and arrests of boys 12 and under rose 100%.\n \n The white youth homicide arrest rate has remained stable, while the black rate has skyrocketed. Some drug policy scholars trace the sudden upsurge in violence to the pharmacological effects of crack/cocaine. Economist Sam Staley argues that the war on drugs and the criminalization of the drug trade generate levels of violence that make the inner city unlivable, with levels of violence far higher than would occur in a world where drugs were controlled by means other than the criminal law.20 Since drug dealers are likely to be carrying large sums of money, they are at serious risk of robbery. Since they cannot rely on the police for protection, they must, to survive, protect themselves.\n\n   Fact 7: Crime, Violence, and Drug Use Go Hand-In-Hand \n From the DEA\n \n According to the 1999 Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) study, more than half of arrestees for violent crimes test positive for drugs at the time of their arrest.\n \n A 1997 FBI study of violence against law enforcement officers found that 24 percent of the assailants were under the influence of drugs at the time they attacked the officers and that 72 percent of the assailants had a history of drug law violations.\n\n \n Makes you want to spark up right now! :(",

Given the institutional and individual bias in favor of restrictive gun laws, the conclusions of the CDC study are remarkable.\n \n You would think that out of 51 scientific studies there would be more evidence of the effectiveness of gun control, if gun control were effective in preventing crime and violence. It is a tribute to the honesty of the CDC panel, given their preconceived ideas that they were willing to issue this report at all. The survey did say in somewhat Orwellian fashion that &#8220;insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness should not be interpreted as evidence of ineffectiveness.&#8221; (Just because 50 studies failed to find a significant result, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the result isn&#8217;t there.)\n\n LOL now add in the National Academy of Sciences failure. 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study.

The survey did say in somewhat Orwellian fashion that &#8220;insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness should not be interpreted as evidence of ineffectiveness.&#8221; \n \n However, I gave them that benefit of the doubt. Maybe they were surprised and would have structured the studies differently? Let there be no mistake. They were out to prove the link between gun control and crime control and FAILED!

The violent crime category includes murder, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. The number of property crimes in the United States from January to June of 2008 decreased 2.5 percent when compared with data from the same time period in 2007. Property crimes include burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft. Arson is also a property crime, but data for arson are not included in property crime totals. Figures for 2008 indicate that arson decreased 5.6 percent in 2008 when compared to 2007 figures.\n\n \n You guys want to take from the Constitution what is NOT yours, or mine to give.

Harvard's Laurence Tribe says, \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\" Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \n\n \n So what you want to do is not warranted given the FAILURE of gun control all over the World while our law enforcement is making stride to be genuinely proud of!",

A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n \n Here is another report produced by Australian Institute of Criminology here called   Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a article about is in the report here.\n Link  Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld' \nCANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. .... reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation,  they have failed to deter hard-core criminals. It also pointed to a large firearms black market. \n \n Almost two-thirds had been bought illegally from friends, family or on the street, with an even higher proportion, 66 per cent, of knives coming from illicit sources. And many carried their weapons regularly despite tough laws against possession in public places. Almost one-third of knife-owning prisoners regularly went out on the streets with their weapons tucked into pockets, boots, clothing or bags, while 14 per cent of gun owners said they carried their firearms with them. The study said that drug users were more likely to use these weapons. \n\n \n The only people disarmed by gun control are the law-abiding citizens who are not the problem.",

This whole argument that gun laws only affect the law-abiding is stupidity itself IMO.\n\n \n The only time I've ever heard of firearms charges actually sticking and being used at a trial is when the ATF is charging someone with an offense, and only when it's something major, like possession of an unregistered short barreled shotgun, or illegal transfer of a \"machine gun\". Not once have I seen or heard of a trial taking place, where firearms charges remained in place against the defendant when the crime was robbery or rape or murder.\n \n Since the laws we have already aren't being enforced, I refuse to believe new ones will be enforced.\n \n \nMaybe just better laws, but the idea of more laws seems to work with lots of other societal problems. Ask a deadbeat dad.\n\n \n And Obama said that what works for Illinois won't necessarily work for the rest of America. This is beyond the point though. The very notion that more gun control is needed, is to say that all 30,000 of the laws we currently have, just aren't enough. It's suggestive of the idea that hundreds of thousands of laws are needed to even approach an issue.\n \n A practical application question: what's the point of passing a law that requires the passage of ten other laws for it to actually work?",

   "Drug violence has spilled across borders, turning Vancouver into Canada's new gang capital \n \n   Mexico's portable drug war \n Mexico's drug wars don't stay in Mexico. The recent spike in gang-related murders in metro Vancouver is a result of the ongoing violence wreaking havoc in Mexico. This is relatively new for Canadians, but particularly in British Columbia, where the numbers speak for themselves. In all of 2008 there were 43 gang-related murders in the province. So far, 2009 has seen 30 shootings &#8211; 12 of which have resulted in deaths. And as a UN summit on drugs convenes in Vienna this week, Vancouverites wonder whether anyone has a solution.\n \n &#8230;.. The gang violence found in Vancouver has also been experienced increasingly by both Calgary and Edmonton, where the recent oil boom fostered high incomes and high-pressure work environments for a young generation: a perfect storm for drugs like cocaine.\n \n But prices here are rising. Overland trafficking through Mexico rose after the US drug enforcement agency began cracking down on Colombian drug routes in the Caribbean. And as the southern US border has tightened, the availability of drugs in the United States and Canada has decreased, forcing gangs to fight over increasingly precious territory. \n \n Canada's suburbanites aren't used to this kind of thing. Vancouver's very public title of \"Canada's Gang Capital\" is not sitting well with locals. The BC government has promised 168 new police officers and 10 new prosecutors to help tackle the problem, but they will be phased in over the next two years.\n\n Gun Control Is NOT Crime Control.

   "Ah, another voice of reason!\n \n   Global gun control \n There may good reasons for deploying the National Guard along the U.S.-Mexican border, but illegal firearms isn't one of them.\n \n The administration recently launched a study to examine whether soldiers should patrol the Southern border to staunch the flow of firearms headed for drug dealers in Latin America. The silence you hear is the concern about armed drug gangs headed here. In short, the administration seems more concerned about the guns going south than the non-citizens streaming north. \n \n We also have a serious gang problem. The U.S. Department of Justice now estimates that 80 percent of U.S. crime is linked to gangs and drugs. Yet, at least part of the president's plan is doomed to fail: Stopping Mexican gangs from getting guns will prove as difficult as stopping them from getting the drugs that they sell. We are losing the drug war. Despite Mexico's strenuous efforts, our neighbor hasn't been able to stop the transnational flow of drugs through Mexico from other Latin American countries. Our own government hasn't done much better stopping contraband. \n \n We won't do any better with guns. The drugs are extremely valuable and drug lords have many enemies, ranging from governments to rival gangs. So gangs have powerful incentives to own guns-to defend their lives and property-and access to vast smuggling networks. \n \n Even digging a moat between the U.S. and Mexico wouldn't stop the flow of guns. Consider the experience of island nations -Ireland, Jamaica, and the United Kingdom- all of which saw murder rates climb after guns were banned. In the land of the disarmed, the one-gun man is king. \n \n Certainly the Mexicans deserve our help when they investigate and prosecute gun murders in their country, just as we deserve their aid when we prosecute drug kingpins here. If we are going to talk about deploying armies on the border, shouldn't the administration ask the Mexicans to deploy their army to stem the tide of migrants headed here? \n\n \n Maybe part of our problems stems from the fact that Liberals agree with Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s statement that immigration enforcement is un-American! :)",

I haven't forgotten.\n\n \n Thanks to our resident detective Tither I've been made aware of this: http://www.courtwatchflorida.org/uploads/Sentinel_2008-12-21_Gun_punishment.pdf\n \n Out of the 362 assault-weapon confiscations tracked by the Sentinel, 243 resulted in criminal charges. Of those, 98 percent ended in a plea bargain, dropped charges or an acquittal or are still awaiting trial.\n \n And then there's this link that I found: How To Keep Dangerous Criminals Behind Bars by Alice Vachss\n \n Across the country, just 3 percent of all felony arrests go to trial and 97 percent are plea bargained or dismissed, according to a recent report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The report also showed that \"arrest-to-trial\" rates range from 2 percent in San Diego to 4 percent in Dallas to the \"high\" rate of 9 percent in Portland, Ore. Trial rates do vary according to the type of crime: In major U.S. cities and counties, the Bureau reported, 23 percent of murder and manslaughter arrests result in trials, while less than 5 percent of stolen property arrests do. Only about 11 percent of rape cases are tried.\n \n Why does this matter? It is only in the tiny percentage of cases where a defendant goes to trial (and then is convicted as charged) that sentencing provisions are truly \"mandatory.\" As a response to America's ever-growing fear of crime, new \"get-tough laws\" are great rhetoric. The reality, however, is that they are falling short, dangerously short. Unless we reform how prosecutors and judges plea bargain, \"tough\" sentencing laws; no matter how well intended, are doomed to failure.",

   "This is just a thought that we as Americans should consider. I don't beleave that gun control will change the situation that we are in with drugs, gangs, and the Cartels to our south. I beleave that stronger gun control may make things worse. As we have seen that the cartels are getting arms from every corner of our planet and not just small arms but military grade arms. To date the gangs in the US have done their killing with rather ordinary arms that they get here. Which is probably how the Cartels used to do their killing years ago they had the arms they needed to protect their illegal trade and to terrorize those who would oppose them localy. Now this has changed the Cartells have now found those who will supply them with real arms RPG's, granades, machine guns, etc. and are now challenging the Mexican military and government in an effort to protect their illegal bussiness and possably take over Mexico. These same Cartels are now expanding their operations in to Canada and using violent street gangs to peddle their poision there too. They are not only supplying them with the product but also with the arms to protect their illegal bussiness and it's profits. I think it naive to beleave that stricter US gun laws will make things better. I beleave it will make things worse. The Cartels will stop at nothing to peddle their drugs where ever there is a market and to protect those markets by any means they deem nessary. If that means supplying the street gangs with military arms thats what they will do. I think the only way that the killing will end is for the military forces of Mexico, US, Canada and Columbia to take these Cartels head on and wipe them out. The Cartels will not stop, they beleave they are strong enough to challenge the Mexican military how long before they get strong enough to challenge the US.

It's potentially a very significant difference.\n \n Let's have a look at the data itself, shall we? Just from the key findings (as linked to by NATO), we get 'According to NDTS data, 58 percent of state and local law enforcement agencies reported that criminal gangs were active in their jurisdictions in 2008'.\n \n Looking at the PDF itself, we get a wonderful little footnote on page 8, under 'criminal activities': \n \"According to local law enforcement information, gang members are responsible for as much as 80 percent of the crime in some locations.5\n ...\n 5: 5. Stated percentage is based solely on self-reporting by local law enforcement. The figures given are not meant to represent an National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) analysis.\" (bold mine)\n \n In other words - unreliable data, to the extent that the NDIC (the creators of the report) saw fit to distance themselves from it. Following on from that - to reduce your figures even more - the individual regional summaries. Dividing it up (remember that the figures for crime responsibility are all unreliable, but even so...):\n \n Central region: 55% of regions with gang activity, responsible for 'as much as 50% of the crime in some locations'\n East region: 57% of regions, unstated crime responsibility\n New England region: 39% of regions, responsible for 'as much as 60% of the crime in some communities'\n Northwest region: 58% of regions, responsible for 'as much as 80% of violent crime in some communities'\n Pacific region: 74% of regions, 'as much as 80% of crime in some jurisdictions is gang-related'\n Southeast region: 68% of regions, unstated crime responsibility\n Southwest region: 63%, responsible for 'as much as 60% of crime in some communities'.\n \n So the '80%' claim is only true in 'some' communities in less than a third of the regions in the US. That's assuming that the data is reliable, which - as the report says - it isn't.\n \n Incidentally, in the same report, page 9:\n \"Law enforcement agencies report that gang members are increasingly using firearms in conjunction with their criminal activities. Moreover, during the latest 5-year reporting period ending in 2007, 94.3 percent of gang-related homicides reportedly involved the use of a firearm. Gang members typically buy, sell, and trade firearms among their associates.

What does the The FBI say? \n   National Gang Threat Assessment Issued \nGangs have long posed a threat to public safety, but as this study shows, gang activity is no longer merely a problem for urban areas. Gang members are increasingly moving to suburban America, bringing with them the potential for increased crime and violence,\" said Assistant Director Kenneth W. Kaiser, FBI Criminal Investigative Division.\n \n Other key findings are as follows:\n \n * Local street gangs, or neighborhood-based street gangs, remain a significant threat because they still constitute the largest number of gangs nationwide. Most engage in violence in conjunction with a variety of crimes, including retail-level drug distribution.\n \n * According to NDTS data, 58 percent of state and local law enforcement agencies reported that criminal gangs were active in their jurisdictions in 2008 compared with 45 percent of state and local agencies.\n \n * Gang members are migrating from urban to suburban and rural areas, expanding the gangs' influence in most regions. They are doing so for a variety of reasons, including expanding drug distribution territories, increasing illicit revenue, recruiting new members, hiding from law enforcement, and escaping from other gangs. Many suburban and rural communities are experiencing increasing gang-related crime and violence because of expanding gang influence.\n \n * Criminal gangs commit as much as 80 percent of the crime in many communities, according to law enforcement officials throughout the nation. Typical gang-related crimes include alien smuggling, armed robbery, assault, auto theft, drug trafficking, extortion, fraud, home invasions, identity theft, murder, and weapons trafficking.\n \n * Gang members are the primary retail-level distributors of most illicit drugs. They also are increasingly distributing wholesale-level quantities of marijuana and cocaine in most urban and suburban communities.\n \n * Some gangs are trafficking illicit drugs at the regional and national levels; several are capable of competing with U.S.-based Mexican drug trafficking organizations.\n \n * U.S.-based gang members illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border for the express purpose of smuggling illicit drugs and illegal aliens from Mexico into the United States.\n \n * Many gangs actively use the Internet to recruit new members and to communicate with members in other areas of the U.S. and in foreign countries.\n \n * Street gangs and outlaw motorcycle gangs pose a growing threat to law enforcement along the U.S.-Canada border. They frequently associate with Canada-based gangs and criminal organizations to facilitate various criminal activities, including drug smuggling into the United States.\n\n \n \n \n Incidentally, in the same report, page 9:\n \"Law enforcement agencies report that gang members are increasingly using firearms in conjunction with their criminal activities.

Are they finally rid of the Gun crime Menace? \n \n   Weapons sell for just \u00a350 as suspects and victims grow ever younger \n Senior police officers have been warning for several months that a growing number of teenagers in big cities are becoming involved in gun crime. \n \n The age of victims and suspects has fallen over the past three years as the availability of firearms in some cities has risen. \n \n \"Illegal firearms have become increasingly accessible to younger offenders who appear more likely to use these firearms recklessly,\" a report on gun crime commissioned by the Home Office cautioned last year.\n\n \n   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture  \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research. A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n \n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n \n Here is another report produced by Australian Institute of Criminology here called   Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a article about is in the report here.\n Link  Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld' \nCANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. .... reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation,  they have failed to deter hard-core criminals.

   "Is there ANYBODY who disagrees with this statement? Sinjin, Galileo, anyone? \nI'd like to clarify the statement, if I may. \n \n Whar I'm saying here is that there isn't sufficient empirical evidence regarding the effects of gun control that has already been used. That doesn't mean that there isn't evidence to back up an argument for gun control in the future - as I mentioned in my above post. It's simply that comparisons between countries, between states - even between times - are inconclusive, because so far there hasn't been definite evidence of causation. In no cases is gun control the only variable which has been changed - which is an essential for any experiment regarding gun control, as any decent scientist will tell you!\n \n If I had to rank the comparisons in order of usefulness, I'd say:\n [most useful]\n Time period comparisons - the closer the two periods are, the better - as less else is likely to have changed.\n Country comparisons - as countries with similar poverty levels, etc do exist, so differences can be minimised. While this is also true comparing states, with these we run into the problem that state borders are entirely unguarded, so there is no opposition to inter-state trafficking. Hence...\n State comparisons. At the bottom - there is very little point in using these at all.\n [least useful]\n \n Note also that this equally cuts down on arguments to remove gun control that is already present - hence my question in my last post about how you would argue your case regarding the UK.\n \n And with that all said... as mentioned above and in previous posts, there are still theoretical arguments why gun control would have a positive effect that are backed up empirically - the effects of prohibition on supply, the rate of defensive gun incidents etc.\n \n \nWhich if these, do you figure gun control will address? \nOf my list? None - it deliberately wasn't included. In your list - it would probably go under 'cultural differences', although that hardly does it justice. Gun control would also increase the effective strength of law enforcement - especially methods such as a firearms owners database.\n If I had to classify the factors that gun control would effect, I'd probably go with these two:[*]Ease of committing crime - carrying a gun makes committing crime a lot easier, due to both it's intimidatory power and massive (&ranged) lethality.[*]Emotional incentive to commit crime - as the presence of a gun can cause people to act in a more aggressive manner. The knowledge that you are carrying a weapon also boosts confidence, giving more incentive to commit crime.\n EDIT: Trigger posted.

I would also say that with those numbers your premiss is false.\n \n GunCite-Gun Control-How Often Are Guns Used in Self-Defense?\n800,000 isn't the lowest estimate by a long way - the NCVS-based study estimated a mere 108,000 gun defences annually.\n \n Klecks study - that which produced the 2.5 million figure - is really quite flawed. I've gone over most of the problems here - and Ethmi had several attempts at raising issues with the NCVS study, all of which failed. To summarise my argument from the thread -\n \n Kleck carried out his study, and got his figure. As this figure was controversially high, the USDoJ sponsored a second survey in 1994 to check it. This survey gave a result of 1.5 million, which Ethmi (and many others) waved about as validation. However, that same USDoJ survey heavily criticises it's own results: \n \n \"Evidence suggests that this survey and others like it overestimate the frequency with which firearms were used by private citizens to defend against criminal attack.\n ...\n The NSPOF does not provide much evidence on whether consumers who buy guns for protection against crime get their money's worth. The NSPOF-based estimate of millions of DGUs each year greatly exaggerates the true number, as do other estimates based on similar surveys.

   "iangb I have gleened over this study I haven't read it word for word. But I find some of the methods that they used to make their conclusions suspisious not only this but find it unusual that their sampling would only encompass less that 3,000 respondents. That they seem to more worried about of false positives than false negatives and they also adjusted the weight of the sampling in the poll. They also don't take in to account that many gun owners don't like to advertise that they are gun owners and are very suspisious of anyone asking them questions about that ownership. Though they did recognize that they had respondents that wouldn't participate in the poll. They also wouldn't recognize anyone as a respondent that lived in a house hold that did have guns but didn't own a gun personaly. And seemed only to interview only one per house hold. They also excluded respondents that didn't see the perp. or didn't know what crime the perp. was planning to commit. or if the respondent didn't show the gun to the perp. or in form him that they had a gun. It seems to me that they were trying to get a specific out come in this poll. This I have mentioned is just from a quick glance and not studying it. I can address each of these things I've mentioned and give reasons why I think they skew the poll. I'll give a couple of examples a perp breaks in to a house and the wife or someone else in the home takes a gun and frightens off the perp. They don't own a gun so they are excluded from the poll. There is a break in late at night the owner takes his gun and with out speaking racks the slide scaring off the perp. this person is also excluded from the poll. In this type of situation you don't want to speak to the perp. the reason is it makes it easier for the intruder to locate where you are it's better to just rack the slide because it gives you the advantage since the perp. won't be able to locate where you.

Also, looking at other studies other than Kleck's the estimates have been around more of above 1 million DGU's a year. If you really read the NCVS study you will realize that their methods of surveying are not very good, especially so involving firearm usage. Not many people will be open about DGU's. If you think this is not a problem than I can't help you. It is a big problem. That means the number of DGU's would be severely limited. That is the estimate would be way off. Even with Kleck's estimates, the DGU's compared with the population is still pretty low. (Less than 1%), but I think it's about right when compared with our population. The rate of firearm usage in crime is even lower still. I think a new study has to be done. It has been, what nearly 17 years since the Kleck and NCVS study.

I think not.\nA criminal would, indeed, be more deterred by an armed victim - but how does the criminal know if the victim is armed? Unless the criminal knows the victim beforehand, this isn't possible - and if the criminal does know the victim, it's simple enough to wait until they aren't near their gun - you may (to borrow a metaphor) own a fire extinguisher just in case you need to put out a fire, but you don't carry one around with you wherever you go! It's a bit of a dichotomy for gun owners: either you can advertise the fact that you are armed, or not. If you do - you get more intimidation, but you also advertise yourself to people who might want to steal your guns. Displaying a gun at the moment of the crime may be some protection - but this assumes you have time to do so - and there are alternatives.\n There are also plenty of alternatives to guns for self/home-defence. None, ultimately, with the same stopping power - but I would argue that the cases where only a gun could save the day are few and far between.\n \n With regards to 'the criminal will have far less experience with a gun' - this simply isn't provable, and I doubt that it is true.

Or are you thinking that the law-abiding and the criminals are one and the same?\n\n At the moment, most guns in the US come from legal sources, simply through illegal methods (or semi-legal ones, such as straw purchasing). If an illegal firearm is seized, the police have to ring the manufacturer with the serial number, who can point them to a dealer, who can point them to another dealer, who can point them to a buyer, who can point them to another buyer, who may well be just the start of a massive chain - very time-consuming to follow, and if one link gets broken the whole thing is a waste of time.\n If all legal guns are entered into an up-to-date database, then the point where the gun exits from that database will be the illegal point. That means it's much easier to find out those who are fuelling the black market.\n \n \nIt sounds like you are. If not please advise.\n\n Sorry, I don't know what you're referring to.\n \n *************************\n \n \nProhibition did absolutely nothing beneficial. Prohibition didn't reduce the supply of alcohol, it simply redirected it to the people who would make it at home. And the supply of homemade booze was so prolific, there were at least 16,000 speakeasies in New York City alone. 16,000 illegal bars in one single city! Does that suggest success to you? It certainly doesn't to me.\nDid you even read the link I gave in my last post? To quote it for you: \"Alcohol consumption during Prohibition declined between 30 and 50 percent \".\n \n That's cutting down supply, however you may protest. Prohibition did carry with it a host of nasty sociological knock-on effects, I'm not denying this. But that's because 'We the People', as Tither put it, continued demanding (and consuming!) alcohol, despite the illegality of it. If you want to get a gun to defend yourself from criminals, are you really going to go to criminals in order to get one? Furthermore, are you going to immediately 'use up' your gun (somehow) and be forced to go back to the criminals in order to get one?\n \n \nIllegal guns are unregulated and uncontrolled, meaning that there's no government oversight in their construction or use. And since the drug cartels are using fully automatic machine guns, that means their illegally procured weapons are deadly than our legally procured ones.\nFirstly, how does 'no government oversight in their construction' make something more deadly, except for possibly to the user? Secondly, what 'government oversight in their use' is there at the moment? Thirdly - is it the fact that they are illegal which makes automatic weapons deadly, or is it the fact that they are automatic? If they were made legal, would they all suddenly become safer?\n \n \nGun violence is apparently so prolific and serious in the UK, that they refuse to air any movie advertisements that, in their words \"condone gun violence\". If the UK were really so much more peaceful and safe than America, then they'd never have to make such an idiotic statement. The fact that they refuse to air a commercial that might encourage the criminal element to shoot up the joint, suggests that the problem is too far out of hand to even attempt to approach.\nI can't decide if this is an appeal to authority, an appeal to absurdity, or simply bad reasoning. It's certainly on a par with your 'gun control in DC can't be working, otherwise they wouldn't be expanding the scheme'.\n I suppose I should respond... firstly, can you show me some evidence that this has taken place, with context? I don't think I can do much else, until then.\n Secondly, you've managed to nicely avoid the whole 'prohibition cuts down supply' thing. Cocaine vs nicotine?\n \n \nThe Mexican drug cartels getting their rocket launchers from Colombia and Central America.\n\n So that's evidence that gun control has failed to affect some of the most powerful gangs in Mexico. OK... but how is this evidence that gun control has done 'nothing', especially in all the places that you've claimed that aren't drug cartels in mexico? It's like saying \"the rain doesn't do anything to make stuff wet, because it's raining and I'm still dry!\"\n \n \nThe fact that at the moment they have other alternatives open to them.\n \n What's stopping YOUR criminals from importing lost or stolen military issue weaponry?\nThere are a lot more criminals that there is importable lost/stolen weaponry.\n You seem to be reverting to the \"It's not worth trying, some people will find a way around the ban\" idea. Out of interest, what do you think about the legality of ecstacy?\n \n \nI don't care. What you're arguing in support of is a preemptive strike, punishing people before they even do anything wrong. Yours is a position suggestive of Orwellian thoughcrime. I don't like it. People in this country are presumed to be innocent until they're proven guilty, and I prefer it that way.\n \n\n Wow, argument shift. Does this mean that you're going to stop making the claim 'gun control only affects those who have no intention of breaking the law'?\n Restricting someone's access to something does not 'assume them guilty' - or, if it does, people in 'this country (America)' are already treated that way. See: illegal drugs, no guns/drugs/cars/nicotine to under-age users, etc.\n \n \nThen do this to prove me wrong. Get a list of everyone arrested for shooting and/or killing another person in the last five years, found guilty, and up until the time of their arrest never had any sort of criminal record that would suggest they were a serious threat to the public and fit to be disarmed.\nThat's shifting the goalposts a bit.\n I've already done if for you for one year - that the recidivism report I was talking about. 44% of people found guilty for murder had never committed a crime before - unless you can find a reason for me why this is not representative of shooters, you've got your evidence.\n \n *****************************\n \n Response to Trigger on the NSPOF report:\n \n The 'more false positives than false negatives' thing is simple maths. To illustrate - I'll set up a thought experiment. Imagine I have 1000 people - 100 of them like cookies, 900 of them hate cookies. 10% (exaggerated to make my point) of all my people are compulsive liars (in reality, this translates to lying, forgetfulness, that which causes 'false positives' and 'false negatives' etc). I ask my 1000 people the question \"Do you like cookies\"?\n \n 900 people hate cookies, but 10% - that's 90 people - will say 'yes'\n 100 people like cookies, but 10% - that's 10 people - will say 'no'.\n \n My survey, then, will record 820 people as 'not liking cookies', and 180 people as 'liking cookies' - despite the fact that the split is actually 100/900. False positives have a much greater effect, because there ar more people to give false positives. \n \n Those examples you've given of invalid exclusions are irrelevant - although one of them is plain false anyway (nowhere was 'who owned the gun' made relevant) and the other is a bit shaky (requires a very specific set of circumstances). Even with all of the 'extra exclusions' - which you say would have made the survey unjustly low - the survey still claims that it is too high. The evidence for this is on page 9, the reasons behind this are on page 10.\n \n ******************************\n \n Response to Charliegone on the NCVS survey:\n \n Your main reason for not liking the NCVS results seems to be \"That seems too low!\" This simply isn't a valid reason - your intuition comes second place to empirical data, sorry. Your other argument is that 'people won't like talking about DGUs'. This may be true for some people - but not all that many. The only reason they wouldn't talk about it is if it was illegal for them to carry a gun at the time, but the survey itself makes it clear that the participants responses cannot be used against them - the survey starts by saying that 'all information is strictly confidential and may be used for statistical purposes only' (paraphrased, bold original).",

   "@ Trigger-\n A criminal would, indeed, be more deterred by an armed victim - but how does the criminal know if the victim is armed?\n\n \n I believe that's the point of not letting people know you're armed; so the criminals will have to wonder and have no way of telling who it's safe to target, and who might be the last person they ever bother again.\n \n That's one of the reasons we absolutely refuse to submit to any sort of database, because it compromises our privacy and can be used to tip off the criminals. Too many newspapers have released lists of all RTC holders in a select state for us to believe that the information really is private. And when those lists are released it's a shopping list to criminals. They could choose to rob those who are on the list when they're not home, or they could decide to go after those who aren't on the list.\n \n Absolutely nobody has the right, or the need, to know who's armed.\n \n \n@Trigger-There are also plenty of alternatives to guns for self/home-defence.\n \n \n And there are hundreds of novelty items that one can order from a catalog, but these aren't needed for living a regular life. Just because there's an alternative to something, doesn't mean that it's any use at all.\n \n \n@Trigger- None, ultimately, with the same stopping power - but I would argue that the cases where only a gun could save the day are few and far between.\n\n \n I would argue that your belief is mistaken. The ability of a firearm to scare any violent individual to the point where they would not only surrender, but turn and run for their lives, is evidence that the firearm is the superior choice of defensive tool.\n \n No matter how many times you try and argue it, LTL tools such as stun guns are worthless when other alternatives are available. For you to use one against a dangerous individual would bring you close enough that you could be disemboweled and killed with a butcher knife.\n \n \n@Tither- At the moment, most guns in the US come from legal sources, simply through illegal methods (or semi-legal ones, such as straw purchasing). If an illegal firearm is seized, the police have to ring the manufacturer with the serial number, who can point them to a dealer, who can point them to another dealer, who can point them to a buyer, who can point them to another buyer, who may well be just the start of a massive chain - very time-consuming to follow, and if one link gets broken the whole thing is a waste of time.\n\n \n I don't care if it seems like a waste of time to you, in my opinion it's the best type of system there is, because the police are contacting those who are best qualified to give them the information they need. The ATF have all relevant records on who made the gun, when it was made, where it was shipped, who sold it, when it was sold, and who bought it. The ATF has all of that information, they're the best source to contact.\n \n A centralized database of gun owners, just because it might make the jobs of the police better, isn't going to work. I remember asking you the hypothetical question about mandating lower speed laws because it would be better for the police, you said making the jobs of the police easier wouldn't be the point for passing a law. Now it looks like you're arguing the opposite.\n \n \n@Tither- If all legal guns are entered into an up-to-date database, then the point where the gun exits from that database will be the illegal point. That means it's much easier to find out those who are fuelling the black market.\n\n \n Then why hasn't it worked for Canada with their national database? It's so complex and mistaken-ridden that they're working on finally killing it off for good.\n \n The ATF already has a backdoor database of every firearm that was bought from a dealer, and in some states from a private sale. But it hasn't helped enough for me to believe that a secondary database would work any better. You're still talking about a massive monetary sinkhole that would eat up funding that could be better used in constructing new jails, hiring more police, or bringing on more prosecuting attorneys.\n \n \n@NATO- Did you even read the link I gave in my last post? To quote it for you: \"Alcohol consumption during Prohibition declined between 30 and 50 percent \".\n\n \n That was their opinion. There was no conclusive evidence that what you suggested was proven factual and accurate. I remember you also trying to claim that Prohibition also cut down on cirrhosis even though the disease takes decades of drinking to develop, and a ten year span isn't enough time to prove accurate.\n \n \nThat's cutting down supply, however you may protest.\n\n \n There were too many illegal bars for your argument to be factual.\n \n \nIf you want to get a gun to defend yourself from criminals, are you really going to go to criminals in order to get one?\n\n \n If there are no other revenue to go through and I felt I really need it, yes!\n \n \n@NATO- Furthermore, are you going to immediately 'use up' your gun (somehow) and be forced to go back to the criminals in order to get one?\n\n \n Ammunition?\n \n \n@NATO- Firstly, how does 'no government oversight in their construction' make something more deadly, except for possibly to the user?\n\n \n Because they can construct it however they see fit, and sell it as they please. That means they can cut cost production by using lower quality materials, or they can construct it to whatever specifications they wish, like putting a tungsten core inside the bullet so it'll penetrate all kinds of armor. With no regulations they can manufacture it however they want and sell it the same.\n \n \n@NATO- Secondly, what 'government oversight in their use' is there at the moment?\n\n \n The 30,000 gun laws regulating every possible facet of their use, construction and distribution?\n \n \n@NATO- Thirdly - is it the fact that they are illegal which makes automatic weapons deadly, or is it the fact that they are automatic? If they were made legal, would they all suddenly become safer?\n\n \n I don't know. Ask those that scream in terror and pound their chests whenever a state proposing opening up NFA sales to civilians and breaking with their previous laws.\n \n \n@NATO- I suppose I should respond... firstly, can you show me some evidence that this has taken place, with context? I don't think I can do much else, until then.\n\n \n Ad featuring Angelina Jolie ordered off UK TV (AP) - Yahoo! Movies\n \n LONDON - A TV ad showing actress Angelina Jolie firing weapons must not be shown because it could be seen as condoning gun violence , Britain's advertising watchdog said Wednesday.\n \n The authority said the ad - which juxtaposes images of gun violence with Jolie showing off her bare back - \"could be seen to condone violence by glorifying or glamorizing the use of guns.\"\n \n \nSecondly, you've managed to nicely avoid the whole 'prohibition cuts down supply' thing. Cocaine vs nicotine?\n\n \n FOXNews.com - Coast Guard Makes Record Drug Bust of 40,000 Pounds of Cocaine - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News\n \n 38,000 pounds of cocaine being shipped into the country. That's hardly cutting down on the supply.\n \n \nSo that's evidence that gun control has failed to affect some of the most powerful gangs in Mexico. OK... but how is this evidence that gun control has done 'nothing', especially in all the places that you've claimed that aren't drug cartels in mexico? It's like saying \"the rain doesn't do anything to make stuff wet, because it's raining and I'm still dry!\"\n\n \n I see it as evidence because Mexico has very strict gun control laws; some could call them even stricter than Britain's, because they restrict ALL firearms of any sort that are chambered for what they define as a \"military caliber\". This hasn't stopped them from getting AK-47s and rocket propelled grenades and anti-tank cannons.\n \n Then there's also the continued story of how there's a widespread illicit arms trade in the UK where a sawed off shotgun can be bought for as little as 50 pounds. They showed pictures of captured handguns, they showed a news video of a reporter being able to buy a fully operational Uzi submachine gun from a black marketeer.\n \n You claim that this is scaremongering and that the trade, if there is one, is too small to be a concern when compared to America. This is your own country we're talking about and you're claiming that the criminals having a new market to sidestep the country's laws is of no concern because America is so much bigger.\n \n \n@NATO- There are a lot more criminals that there is importable lost/stolen weaponry.\n\n \n And the ones with the funding gets the weaponry, which they can distribute to the lower echelon criminals.\n \n \n@NATO- You seem to be reverting to the \"It's not worth trying, some people will find a way around the ban\" idea.\n \n \n A couple of years ago Jersey City in New Jersey was passing a one-gun-a-month law. Those voting on the passage of the bill admitted that they knew the law would do absolutely nothing to stop criminals from getting guns illegally, but said they had to do something and start somewhere, and used that as justification for passing it.\n \n \n@NATO- Out of interest, what do you think about the legality of ecstacy?\n\n \n Ecstasy isn't legal, it's listed under Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substance Act, with selling it carrying a life sentence.\n \n \n@NATO- Wow, argument shift. Does this mean that you're going to stop making the claim 'gun control only affects those who have no intention of breaking the law'?\n\n \n Why would I do that? The claim is still accurate.\n \n \n@NATO- Restricting someone's access to something does not 'assume them guilty' - or, if it does, people in 'this country (America)' are already treated that way. See: illegal drugs, no guns/drugs/cars/nicotine to under-age users, etc.\n\n \n Then what's the real justification for telling somebody that they can no longer own a legal product, even though the product is still legal and they don't have a prohibiting record?\n \n \n@NATO- I've already done if for you for one year - that the recidivism report I was talking about. 44% of people found guilty for murder had never committed a crime before - unless you can find a reason for me why this is not representative of shooters, you've got your evidence.\n\n \n And how many of those 44% were individuals who had taken plea bargains for previous offenses that never went on their record due to the conditions of the plea? How many were gang members or had gang affiliations? How many of them were found guilty of murder because they couldn't afford a good lawyer and got railroaded by the system?\n \n \n@Trigger- Those examples you've given of invalid exclusions are irrelevant - although one of them is plain false anyway (nowhere was 'who owned the gun' made relevant) and the other is a bit shaky (requires a very specific set of circumstances). Even with all of the 'extra exclusions' - which you say would have made the survey unjustly low - the survey still claims that it is too high. The evidence for this is on page 9, the reasons behind this are on page 10.\n\n \n Where exactly was the survey conducted? Location makes a large difference.\n \n \n@Charlie- Your main reason for not liking the NCVS results seems to be \"That seems too low!\" This simply isn't a valid reason - your intuition comes second place to empirical data, sorry.\n\n \n It's valid enough reason to think that it's not right. Kellerman's data suggesting that gun owners are 43 times more likely to kill a friend or family member than a true home invader are far too high to be valid, and he was discredited for his dishonesty.\n \n \n@Charlie- The only reason they wouldn't talk about it is if it was illegal for them to carry a gun at the time, but the survey itself makes it clear that the participants responses cannot be used against them\n\n \n So somebody's desire for privacy and not having their details made a matter of public record is evidence that they've done something illegal? Does that mean the guy who doesn't want his gym buddies to see the kitten tattoo on his butt he got while stone drunk is evidence that it was obtained in an illegal manner?",

That's proof, not 'what you know'.\n \n I meant to put this into my last post, incidentally, but I forgot. I'm fully in agreement with Charlie - there needs to be more recent work done. Quite a lot has changed in the last 15 years.\n \n \nFor example, and If I could, I would make it a Constitutional amendment that totally barred the government from any knowledge or data of gun owners unless seeking to track down a crime.

However, it would seem that criminals have become habitualised to this sort of threat. Possibly this has been helped by the fact that they, too, have guns - and the initiative, when committing a crime..\n \n \nThat's one of the reasons we absolutely refuse to submit to any sort of database, because it compromises our privacy and can be used to tip off the criminals. Too many newspapers have released lists of all RTC holders in a select state for us to believe that the information really is private.

Just because there's an alternative to something, doesn't mean that it's any use at all.\n\n You're confusing your words. You buy novelty items to be an addition to your 'normal life', not an alternative. Something which is an 'alternative' must, by defintion, have much of the functionality of the thing which it is an alternative to - otherwise it wouldn't be an alternative.\n Double glazing, secure locks and fake CCTV cameras all have their uses, never mind tasers.\n \n \nI would argue that your belief is mistaken. The ability of a firearm to scare any violent individual to the point where they would not only surrender, but turn and run for their lives, is evidence that the firearm is the superior choice of defensive tool.\n...didn't I just say that? Ultimately, firearms can have the most effect. It's simply that, along with that defensive power, you get a hell of a lot of offensive power - and it's that which I'm arguing against.\n \n \nNo matter how many times you try and argue it, LTL tools such as stun guns are worthless when other alternatives are available. For you to use one against a dangerous individual would bring you close enough that you could be disemboweled and killed with a butcher knife.\nNot 'worthless', just 'inferior' in some circumstances. However, inferior tools still suffice. That's why I'm typing this on a 4-year-old laptop with a missing 'g' key.\n \n \nI don't care if it seems like a waste of time to you, in my opinion it's the best type of system there is, because the police are contacting those who are best qualified to give them the information they need. The ATF have all relevant records on who made the gun, when it was made, where it was shipped, who sold it, when it was sold, and who bought it. The ATF has all of that information, they're the best source to contact.\nThe police need to know who was the last legal owner of the gun. The ATF knows who the gun was initially sold to - that's not helpful. Amnesia aside, the person who knows best the identity of the last legal owner of the gun, is the last legal owner of the gun.\n \n \nA centralized database of gun owners, just because it might make the jobs of the police better, isn't going to work. I remember asking you the hypothetical question about mandating lower speed laws because it would be better for the police, you said making the jobs of the police easier wouldn't be the point for passing a law. Now it looks like you're arguing the opposite.\nNo, I'm fairly sure I said something like 'making their job easier' shouldn't be the only concern. However, the only cost to the gun buyer in this case is that they have to spend 5-10 minutes filling in a form - not even that, if the seller does most of it for them. That's entirely different from putting 55mph limiters on cars to prevent high-speed chases (I'm fairly sure that was the original context).\n \n \nThen why hasn't it worked for Canada with their national database?

I remember you also trying to claim that Prohibition also cut down on cirrhosis even though the disease takes decades of drinking to develop, and a ten year span isn't enough time to prove accurate.\nThat wasn't me, although it's mentioned in my link. If you want to ignore what I post, I guess I can't stop you...\n \n \nThere were too many illegal bars for your argument to be factual.\nEvidence, country-wide?\n \n \nIf there are no other revenue to go through and I felt I really need it, yes!\n\n How many people do you think feel they 'really need' a gun?\n \n \nAmmunition?\n\n How much ammo have you used in the past week? A lot less than a speakeasy visitor would have drunk in a week, that's for sure.\n \n \nBecause they can construct it however they see fit, and sell it as they please. That means they can cut cost production by using lower quality materials, or they can construct it to whatever specifications they wish, like putting a tungsten core inside the bullet so it'll penetrate all kinds of armor. With no regulations they can manufacture it however they want and sell it the same.\n\n So you're worried by armour-piercing bullets?

   "A criminal would, indeed, be more deterred by an armed victim - but how does the criminal know if the victim is armed? Unless the criminal knows the victim beforehand, this isn't possible - and if the criminal does know the victim, it's simple enough to wait until they aren't near their gun - you may (to borrow a metaphor) own a fire extinguisher just in case you need to put out a fire, but you don't carry one around with you wherever you go!\n \n \n This is where the unarmed benifit from the gun owners. You don't want the criminal to know who is armed and who isn't for the simple reason that if the criminal knew he would have the advantage. He would then know who was safe to attack or who to kill to get a gun or who to avoid. This is why the permits to carry are concealed carry permits. Lets put it this way if no one was allowed to carry a concealed firearm or better yet no one was allowed to own a gun legaly do you think a criminal would hesitate to assult, rob or rape at will? It would be open season on the public. But if lets say 50% of the public were armed don't you think that the criminal be hesitent or ditured from comitting a crime since he has a one in two chance on encountering an armed victim? Then he would have a good chance of getting his butt shot off. \n \n \n Displaying a gun at the moment of the crime may be some protection - but this assumes you have time to do so - and there are alternatives.\n\n \n If you carry a gun for protection there are procedures that you employ when doing so you have to have the advantage in this type of a situation. First is stay away from bad areas if it can be avoided and be aware of your suroundings and stay in well lit areas and around other people. Second if you have to enter these areas have the gun in your hand wheather its in a pocket or in your purse(don't advertise). Observe anyone you see if they begin to approch you try to avoid them run if you have to (a moving target is harder to hit). Don't pull the gun unless you have no other choice. If they have agun on you shoot through the pocket or purse (don't give them any chance what so ever). These are just some of the procedures that you employ when confronted on the street. There are diffrent ones when you are in the home since you are on your own turf and have the advantage to start with.\n \n \nThere are also plenty of alternatives to guns for self/home-defence. None, ultimately, with the same stopping power - but I would argue that the cases where only a gun could save the day are few and far between. \n\n \n There are realy no alternatives that will give you a second chance other than a gun where you can keep a safe distance from your assailent. \n \n \nWith regards to 'the criminal will have far less experience with a gun' - this simply isn't provable, and I doubt that it is true. Sure, some gun owners regularly practice with their firearm - but I don't doubt that some criminals do as well. \n\n \n Yes it is, what is the last thing a criminal want's to do? Draw attention to themselves. Beleave me discharging a gun will draw peoples attention and the cops will be right behind. The law abiding gun owner dosn't have to worry about the cops since they own the gun legaly for them when the cops show up all you do is show them the permit and the cops go away. A law abiding gun owner will go to a shooting range a criminal won't because he has no permit to show to use the range. I've had cops show up when I've been shooting and this is with a machine gun they ask if I'm licenced I show them my permit and the go away with a have a nice day. A criminal would be stuipid to practice since they have no permit to show they own the gun legaly. They would have to go to a realy secluded area to practice and they are not that easy to find especialy in this political climate, somebody heres someone shooting out side of a range and they are calling the cops in hysterics. If I don't go to a range to shoot the police ask me to call them first so they don't make a wasted a trip.",

   "Response to Charliegone on the NCVS survey:\n \n Your main reason for not liking the NCVS results seems to be \"That seems too low!\" This simply isn't a valid reason - your intuition comes second place to empirical data, sorry. Your other argument is that 'people won't like talking about DGUs'. This may be true for some people - but not all that many. The only reason they wouldn't talk about it is if it was illegal for them to carry a gun at the time, but the survey itself makes it clear that the participants responses cannot be used against them - the survey starts by saying that 'all information is strictly confidential and may be used for statistical purposes only' (paraphrased, bold original).\n\n \n Sorry but that's not what I said. I said they do not coincide with other similar studies done. Why do other studies get higher numbers of DGU's and they NCVS gets the lowest? It seems to me that either the NCVS is extremely flawed and/or the other studies done are completely BS. 1 against several others...hmmm. The DGU's are something no one is comfortable speaking about it. The government can say all they want, but the fact is people will have a big mistrust of government. People have a legitimate reason to have this mistrust. Waco, SKS confiscations in CA, Robinson M96 confiscations in CA..the list goes on, yet you expect them to be trustworthy of people identifying themselves as government agents for the purpose of a \"survey?\" I'm sure a lot people felt distrust and would withhold information. Also what of the questions asked? I think Kleck put it clearly:\n \n \"It is not hard for gun-using victims interviewed in the NCVS to withhold information about their use of a gun, especially since they are never directly asked whether they used a gun for self-protection. They are asked only general questions about whether they did anything to protect themselves. In short, respondents are merely give the opportunity to volunteer the information that they have used a gun defensively. All it takes for a respondents to conceal a DGU is to simply refrain from mentioning it, i.e., to leave it out of what may be an otherwise accurate and complete account of the crime incident.\" \n \n BTW, here are the questions asked.\n \n Was there anything you did or tried to do about the incident while it was going on?\n \n Did you do anything (else) with the idea of protecting yourself or your property while the incident was going on?\n \n It does NOT directly ask did you use a gun or at least say any other weapon to defend yourself. \n \n I'm not going to say the Kleck study is without flaws, I'm sure it has some, but compared to the NCVS methods (complex selective method of variables, unspecific questions), Kleck's is a saint. \n \n Also, I have said it before, I think some of the questions we have warrant a new study that fixes some of these discrepancies.",

   "@Tither- OK... so now all you have to do is prove that a sufficiently large proportion of gun owners are as government-paranoid as you are claiming, and you're home dry. That's proof, not 'what you know'.\n\n \n It's not paranoia, it's caution. Too much has happened in the past for us to believe that our information won't be used against us at a future point. The 5th Amendment says we're protected against self-incrimination, and registration databases have been used against the people before in the past.\n \n \n@Tither- I meant to put this into my last post, incidentally, but I forgot. I'm fully in agreement with Charlie - there needs to be more recent work done. Quite a lot has changed in the last 15 years.\n\n \n Quite a bit indeed. Unfortunately some of the changes are too recent for there to be any definite proof of success or failure.\n \n \n@Tither- You have nothing to hide, you do not fear corruption, but you don't want your information going into a confidential, anonymous report? Without meaning offense, that's mighty paranoid. On what basis do you want to deny your information being used in this way?\n\n \n Well on an easy to understand basis, I'd object because the information might be sold to junk mail vendors who would put me on their mailing lists and ship me magazines and catalogs I'd have no interest in. Nothing is confidential anymore, there's always somebody trading information and digging up stuff to sell to somebody else to make a profit.\n \n I wound up on a mail order catalog list that sells all sorts of hunting and outdoor equipment, and it didn't happen until after I bought a can of gun solvent from Wal-Mart. \n \n \n@Tither- How would gun owner data that only worked when used to 'track down a crime' work?\n\n \n It would work the way it's currently being used. If the police recover a firearm at a crime scene they run the information if it hasn't been obliterated and left untraceable by the scumbag that had it.\n \n \n@NATO- Indeed. However, it would seem that criminals have become habitualised to this sort of threat. Possibly this has been helped by the fact that they, too, have guns - and the initiative, when committing a crime..\n\n \n Unlikely. In states like California and New York where concealed carry is extremely limited, criminals are still routinely armed, as I learned during some of my visits. In DC the playing field was a criminal's delight; nobody who lived there could be armed, meaning it was the path of least resistance. But DC was still billed as the murder capital for 30 long years despite the fact that the criminals who lived there didn't need their guns for victimizing purposes.\n \n \n@NATO- You're confusing your words. You buy novelty items to be an addition to your 'normal life', not an alternative. Something which is an 'alternative' must, by defintion, have much of the functionality of the thing which it is an alternative to - otherwise it wouldn't be an alternative. Double glazing, secure locks and fake CCTV cameras all have their uses, never mind tasers.\n\n \n Touche.\n \n What exactly is \"double glazing\" though?\n \n \n...didn't I just say that? Ultimately, firearms can have the most effect. It's simply that, along with that defensive power, you get a hell of a lot of offensive power - and it's that which I'm arguing against.\n\n \n Most anything designed for a defensive application has an offensive application as well. A lot of people say this isn't the case but I believe differently. Granted there are some exceptions, but when it comes to personal defense items, the abuse of such have shown their ability to cause harm to others.\n \n \nThe police need to know who was the last legal owner of the gun. The ATF knows who the gun was initially sold to - that's not helpful. Amnesia aside, the person who knows best the identity of the last legal owner of the gun, is the last legal owner of the gun.\n\n \n What we have in place will tell the police who the last known legal owner of a recovered gun was. In some states you might know who the gun was sold to in a face-to-face transaction, but then again you might not because they could be using a fake ID.\n \n \nNo, I'm fairly sure I said something like 'making their job easier' shouldn't be the only concern. However, the only cost to the gun buyer in this case is that they have to spend 5-10 minutes filling in a form - not even that, if the seller does most of it for them.\n\n \n Not quite. Last year in Pennsylvania a bill was filed that, if passed, would require gun owners to register every gun they owned with the state (or city, I can't remember if it was a statewide bill or a local bill) and would charge them a $10 per gun fee, require fingerprints and photographing just like with a sex offender, and if the registration was rejected for any reason (and there was no protection against a rejection in the bill) then you could no longer own your guns and would be required to turn them into the police. And this registration process had to be repeated every single year.\n \n This is all assuming that the registration process would only take 5-10 minutes like you say. If you have to register at...say your town's police department, and there are thousands of people who own guns in your town, the process for registration could take weeks to resolve. That would involve standing in line, waiting, taking time off from work, putting errands on hold, etc. It's not as simple and streamlined as you make it out to be. Every state or city that requires people to register their privately owned firearms requires coming into a central location to do it, there's no mail-in option.\n \n \n'backdoor database'? Can you link me? Thanks.\n\n \n Background check Form 4473, if I remember correctly. All licensed dealers are required to keep written records of every firearms transfer that goes on, and they have to maintain these records for as long as they're in business, and once they close the laws state that all records have to be forwarded to ATF headquarters to be kept.\n \n These forms have the name, address, phone number, social security number, height and weight of every purchaser, along with the make, model, caliber, and security number of every purchase that person made, along with a record of how many guns were bought in one trip.\n \n \n@NATO- Evidence, country-wide?\n\n \n This is all I've found so far: Did Alcohol Use Decrease During Alcohol Prohibition?\n \n The law could not quell the continuing demand for alcoholic products. Thus, where legal enterprises could no longer supply the demand, an illicit traffic developed, from the point of manufacture to consumption. The institution of the speakeasy replaced the institution of the saloon. Estimates of the number of speakeasies throughout the United States ranged from 200,000 to 500,000 (Lee, 1963: 68).\n \n \nHow many people do you think feel they 'really need' a gun?\n\n \n In round numbers, I don't know. In terms of category, I'd say any wife that's been battered by her husband and has taken out a restraining order on him but keeps getting harassed and terrified. Anybody who has to work nights and doesn't feel safe walking alone in the parking lot. Any single mother who lives in a high crime neighborhood and has lost all faith in the police. Anybody who reads the news and is worried about the growing crime rates. Anybody near the Mexico border.\n \n \n@NATO- How much ammo have you used in the past week? A lot less than a speakeasy visitor would have drunk in a week, that's for sure.\n\n \n In the past week? Not very much because it's been too windy, and ammunition demand is outweighing supply. Last year, however, when you could find anything you were looking for and it seemed like there was an excess of ammunition available, at the high point of the year I went through more than 550 rounds in one day.\n \n And I'd really like to see somebody try and drink ammo. They'd have to be seriously drunk to try that kind of stunt.\n \n \n@NATO- So you're worried by armour-piercing bullets? Weren't you arguing previously that these type of bullets should be legal anyway?\n\n \n No it was just an example. The real thing to be concerned about with illegal guns produced without government regulation is when they're disguised like canes, pens, cellphones, flashlights, asthma inhalers, stop watches, cigarette lighters, etc. \n \n Items like these are normally regulated by the National Firearms Act and are categorized as Any Other Weapons, subject to registration with the ATF. But when they're made and sold illegally there's no way to tell who's armed and the police won't know who to look for if there's a shooting.\n \n \n@NATO- Construction and distribution is irrelevant to my question - and how does the regulations on use differ whether a gun is legal or illegally purchased?\n\n \n You asked for what government oversight there is currently. We have laws regulating everything regarding guns. We have laws that dictate who can own a gun, who can't own a gun, what has to be done before one can own a gun, where you can keep it, where you can't take it, what you can't do with it, what qualifies as assault with a deadly weapon, etc.\n \n \n@NATO- Perhaps it's simply that we care more about gun violence than you (Jack Thompson aside)?\n\n \n It's more like you're hypersensitive to the matter and looking to make a big deal out of something minor. Most normal people wouldn't think twice about an advertisement for a movie being seen as anything other than cheap entertainment.\n \n \n@NATO- After all, the US has much more gun violence than the UK...\n \n \n The US has much more of just about everything compared to the UK. This is hardly accurate for a compare and contrast, however.\n \n \n@NATO- How have you not learned this by now? You can't demonstrate 'cutting down' with a single figure! If cocaine was legal and that figure jumps to 200,000 pounds of cocaine, do you still call 20,000 pounds 'not cutting down'?\n\n \n Well what in round numbers would it take to make the point? I've got a whole Yahoo! search of drug busts where pounds of cocaine were found at the scene.\n \n Also, according to this article a single pound of cocaine can bring about $11,000. That means whoever was going to receive that 38,000 pounds of cocaine by boat stood to make about $418 million dollars. That's an awful lot of drug money for there supposedly being an effectively reduced supply",

Although similar to Seattle in many ways, Vancouver has adopted a more restrictive approach to the regulation of handguns. During the study period, both cities had similar rates of burglary and robbery. In Seattle, the annual rate of assault was modestly higher than that in Vancouver (simple assault: relative risk, 1.18; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.15 to 1.20; aggravated assault: relative risk, 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.12 to 1.19). However, the rate of assaults involving firearms was seven times higher in Seattle than in Vancouver. Despite similar overall rates of criminal activity and assault, the relative risk of death from homicide, adjusted for age and sex, was significantly higher in Seattle than in Vancouver (relative risk, 1.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.28 to 2.08). Virtually all of this excess risk was explained by a 4.8-fold higher risk of being murdered with a handgun in Seattle as compared with Vancouver. Rates of homicide by means other than guns were not substantially different in the two study communities. We conclude that restricting access to handguns may reduce the rate of homicide in a community.\" \n NEJM -- Handgun regulations, crime, assaults, and homicide.

   "  Gun control and consequences \n Rarely considered, though, are the harmful effects of gun control, and how it leaves law-abiding people at the mercy of criminals who are perfectly willing to use guns illegally.\n \n In response to the Alabama shooting, a columnist for London's Telegraph newspaper pointed out some troubling facts about his own country's elimination of gun rights. Gerald Warner had this advice for America:\n \n \"Any American citizens who are tempted to go down the road of prohibition might be advised to consider the experience of Britain. ... In 1997, the year of the ban (on handguns in Britain), there were 2,636 handgun offences; in 2007 there were 4,175. In England and Wales there are now 28 firearms offences committed every day. Gun crime is now one of the most formidable challenges to law and order.\n \n \"Or Americans might look at Australia where, a year ago, a Draconian ban enforced the destruction of 640,381 personal firearms, at a cost of more than $500 million. The results? After 25 years of steady decrease in robberies with firearms, this offence increased by 44 per cent in one year. Homicides with guns increased by 3.2 per cent, assaults by 8.6 per cent. In the state of Victoria homicides with firearms rose 300 per cent. Break-ins and assaults on the elderly hugely increased.\"\n \n Gun control disarms the innocent to the benefit of criminals.

The violent clubs also have little regard for public safety. Some things, it seems, have not changed since Milperra.

A battle for turf in Canada between the Rock Machine and Hells Angels in the late 1990s claimed 100 lives. In Scandinavia in the mid-'90s, the Hells Angels and Bandidos had a turf war in which 11 people were killed and more than 400 violent acts performed. And last summer in Europe, more than 30 bikie gang-related shootings happened in Copenhagen. \n\n \n   Ban bikie gangs across Australia: police \n Victoria's police union has demanded bikie gangs be banned across Australia amid fears their state could become a haven for the groups. \n \n He said the gangs should be outlawed. \n \n I guess after you try banning some guns, then the next thing you gotta try banning the criminals! \n \n   Fears gangland war has spread to Canberra \n POLICE are investigating whether a double murder in Canberra is a dramatic escalation of bikie violence, triggered by an increasingly brutal turf war on the eastern seaboard. \n\n \n Anyone getting the picture that taking guns from the law-abiding citizen is NOT Crime Control?",

Did anyone ever say thank you? Will you EVER STOP TAKING what is not ours to give?\n \n You only talk about gun deaths in England, but the death rate has been fairly constant before and after very strict gun control has been enacted even in countries very much like ours. But their Violent Crime Rate has become horrendous. Why? \n \n The violent death rate, here in our country, is horrendous, and should be dealt with, but our violent crime rate is far less than theirs. Why? \n \n However, it seems to us that gun control groups only want to deal with our society's problems with gun control, then exit the fight. If you take a gun away from someone with violent tenancies, or from some dysfunctional youths being socialized by criminal drug gangs, without fixing the problem, they will use a different method to dispatch their victims, or commit their violence. That is what I am trying to convey with my examples of England and Australia, and even Canada.\n \n These countries murder rate is, and always has been, very low compared to ours, and I sincerely hope that some day we can get together and learn the lessons of correct socialization from these countries. However that cannot happen until we deal fairly with the issue that Drug Dealers, who already import in Illegal Product, can and do import in guns as well in countries with very strict gun control! Just like England and Australia are doing right now.\n \n The fact is, Gun Control only disarms the law abiding who are not the problem. \n \n   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research.  A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a machine gun for \u00a3800.  \n \n \n A report from Australia&#8217;s FBI.   Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a news article about the report. Link   Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld'   \n CANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. &#8230;. reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation, they have failed to deter hard-core criminals. It also pointed to a large firearms black market.\n\n \n We are going to fight tooth and nail for a Constitutional Bill of Right, against results like these. We want murders to be as few as possible. We also want crime to be as low as possible. That is why many choose to carry a gun. We think of it as a safety program, while those with a Liberal Bent are busy creating a Utopian society. But we are not there yet. However it seems that gun control groups want to force their ideals on us even though you cannot promise the safely we even have now.",

   "  The Myth of 90 Percent: Only a Small Fraction of Guns in Mexico Come From U.S.  \n A Look at the Numbers\n \n In 2007-2008, according to ATF Special Agent William Newell, Mexico submitted 11,000 guns to the ATF for tracing. Close to 6,000 were successfully traced -- and of those, 90 percent -- 5,114 to be exact, according to testimony in Congress by William Hoover -- were found to have come from the U.S.\n \n But in those same two years, according to the Mexican government, 29,000 guns were recovered at crime scenes.\n \n In other words, 68 percent of the guns that were recovered were never submitted for tracing. And when you weed out the roughly 6,000 guns that could not be traced from the remaining 32 percent, it means 83 percent of the guns found at crime scenes in Mexico could not be traced to the U.S.\n \n So, if not from the U.S., where do they come from? There are a variety of sources:\n \n -- The Black Market. Mexico is a virtual arms bazaar, with fragmentation grenades from South Korea, AK-47s from China, and shoulder-fired rocket launchers from Spain, Israel and former Soviet bloc manufacturers.\n \n -- Russian crime organizations. Interpol says Russian Mafia groups such as Poldolskaya and Moscow-based Solntsevskaya are actively trafficking drugs and arms in Mexico.\n \n - South America. During the late 1990s, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) established a clandestine arms smuggling and drug trafficking partnership with the Tijuana cartel, according to the Federal Research Division report from the Library of Congress.\n \n -- Asia. According to a 2006 Amnesty International Report, China has provided arms to countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Chinese assault weapons and Korean explosives have been recovered in Mexico.\n \n -- The Mexican Army. More than 150,000 soldiers deserted in the last six years, according to Mexican Congressman Robert Badillo. Many took their weapons with them, including the standard issue M-16 assault rifle made in Belgium.\n \n -- Guatemala. U.S. intelligence agencies say traffickers move immigrants, stolen cars, guns and drugs, including most of America's cocaine, along the porous Mexican-Guatemalan border. On March 27, La Hora, a Guatemalan newspaper, reported that police seized 500 grenades and a load of AK-47s on the border. Police say the cache was transported by a Mexican drug cartel operating out of Ixcan, a border town.\n",

Next!\n \n Is the ATF a good enough source? \n \n \" EL PASO (AP) &#8212; Nearly all illegal guns seized in Mexico come from the United States, the head of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Monday.\n ATF acting director Michael Sullivan said investigators have traced 90 to 95% of the weapons found in Mexico to the U.S. Generally, only law-enforcement officers or military personnel can legally possess guns in Mexico.\n \n Sullivan, speaking at the fifth annual Border Security Conference at the University of Texas at El Paso, said the weapons are being traced as part of an effort by the U.S. and Mexico to stop the illegal flow of guns south.\n \n \"In Mexico, investigators have provided some tremendous leads ... to weapons trafficking organizations,\" Sullivan said.\n \n One bust came in May, when the owner of a Phoenix gun shop was arrested on charges that he knowingly sold hundreds of weapons to \"straw purchasers\" who funneled the weapons to violent drug cartels in Mexico. Two Mexican men accused of helping to set up the sales also were arrested.\n ......\n \n FBI Director Robert Mueller, who also spoke at the border conference Monday, said the FBI is working directly with Mexican officials as part of an anti-kidnapping effort in Laredo and Nuevo Laredo. His agency has also developed a task force to focus on the \"very few law enforcement officials who assist drug cartels\" in the U.S., as well as helping curb the growth of prison gangs such as the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13. ....... \" \n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-08-11-mexico-guns_N.htm",

   "Is the ATF a good enough source? \n\n \n Not when they intentionally close down a gun store because somebody put \"MS\" instead of writing out \"Mississippi\" and declaring that such as an intentional mistake.\n \n But if you want to use the ATF as the source of all information... The Myth of 90 Percent: Only a Small Fraction of Guns in Mexico Come From U.S. - Presidential Politics | Political News - FOXNews.com\n \n \nWhat's true, an ATF spokeswoman told FOXNews.com, in a clarification of the statistic used by her own agency's assistant director, \"is that over 90 percent of the traced firearms originate from the U.S.\"\n \n But a large percentage of the guns recovered in Mexico do not get sent back to the U.S. for tracing, because it is obvious from their markings that they do not come from the U.S.\n \n \"Not every weapon seized in Mexico has a serial number on it that would make it traceable, and the U.S. effort to trace weapons really only extends to weapons that have been in the U.S. market,\" Matt Allen, special agent of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told FOX News.\n \n In 2007-2008, according to ATF Special Agent William Newell, Mexico submitted 11,000 guns to the ATF for tracing. Close to 6,000 were successfully traced -- and of those, 90 percent -- 5,114 to be exact, according to testimony in Congress by William Hoover -- were found to have come from the U.S.\n \n But in those same two years, according to the Mexican government, 29,000 guns were recovered at crime scenes.\n \n In other words, 68 percent of the guns that were recovered were never submitted for tracing. And when you weed out the roughly 6,000 guns that could not be traced from the remaining 32 percent, it means 83 percent of the guns found at crime scenes in Mexico could not be traced to the U.S.\n\n \n Is that good enough for you?",
