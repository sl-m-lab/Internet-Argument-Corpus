   "After another record month of trade deficit, increasing bond yields, the bottom falling out of the timber/lumber market (anyone who thinks the housing bubble just has a slow leak is hiding behind something), I'm real curious to see what the Fed has to say about local economies. Today at 2:00pm EST. Any guesses? Their past history has been to keep it in-line with administration GDP propaganda guesses, but from what I see in my region that'll be difficult without really cooking the numbers.",

   "Missed this post this morning, but as usual they buried it in language and tried to offset big negatives with relatively small positives resulting in a benign report. This is beige book stuff....half the country could be starving in the streets while the other half is under attack by the canaidans and it would be the same. I did find the CEo survey interesting for this month:\n \n \n[US CEO CONFIDENCE SINKS] Optimism among chief executives fell to the lowest in almost in 5 years said the Conference Board. The headline index dropped to 44 in Q3 from 50 last time and was the first time below the 50 boom/bust line, when it was at 40 in Q4 2001. The index hit a record low of 31 in late 2000. The index of CEOs' assessment on current conditions fell too, from 47 to 43. Moreover, only 16% of CEOs polled rate current conditions as better, down from about 27% in the Q2 poll. They were less upbeat about their own industry outlook in line with lowered confidence on the economy ahead. Now, only 16% expect economic conditions to improve in coming months, down from 21% last quarter. Also, fewer firms expect to hike capex at 28%, down from 34% last year. \n\n \n The CEO survey has been one of the most accurate leading indicators over the last 20 years, wiht a 6 month hit rate of nearly 100%. A fall below the boom/bust line is considered pretty damn serious.\n \n The stock market is showing and incredible amount of detachment from reality. The DOW hit another record high today, despite the fact that our august trade deficit set another record, and the fact that apparently the guys who are running the companies that people are buying stock in have a pessimistic outlook. \n \n It boggles the mind.",

   "One CEO function is embedding a positive attitude in the company work force and stockholders. Any public CEO survey response is far more positive than his/her worse and most probable case scenario financial models. Below 50% is contrary to everything put forth by the Fed and current administration. \n \n I'm in agreement what we're hearing from our public figures is mind-boggling trash. Why would people be stupid enough to increase retirement plan contributions in equity funds with a declining economy and USD based on political propaganda? The trade deficit was way beyond even conservative estimates.",
