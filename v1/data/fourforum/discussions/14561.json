You're talking avbout cultural changes that can take literally generations and centuries to happen, and then only when those countries' governments are on board. In the meantime, helping people where they are is a good thing to do.\n \n (Incidentally, since when are anti-theists suddenly so interested in peoples' self-sufficiency instead of government handouts and so forth? Maybe there's hope yet! emoticon_xgood)\n \n \nCommon sense, the laws of Nature and the future of the human race says that birth control is a necessity.\n\n \n Depends on many factors. Again, we need to get away from arguing about things in such generalisms. \n \n \nNot so.\n Feeding starving people and doing nothing to prevent their population increase and making them self-sufficient is not helping them. It is only feeding the problem.\n\n \n Given the very long-term challenges of changing an entire culture and it's government, which is required to make people self-sufficient, giving people something to eat when their starving is still the better way. Of course it's a good idea to work toward making them self-sufficient. Anyone is going to agree with that. But that's a policy-issue that involves resource distribution which is often in the hands of 3rd world governments. So we still shouldn't not help a starving person when they are in need. Surely you're just being belligerent here. I would hate to think you really think in such a non-compassionate way.\n \n \nProviding clean drinking water? Let's not go there, okay? (If you insist, I'll have to hit you first with the humanitarian effort to supply 'clean drinking water' to the people of Bangladesh.)\n\n \n I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about. you'll have to let me know what horrible thing you no doubt think religious people have done in the case of Bangladesh. I know for a fact numerous Christian groups work toward establishing infrastructure for clean drinking water in a number of countries.",
