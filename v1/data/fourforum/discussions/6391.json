   "Switzerland is the Most Contemptible Among the Enemies of Islam: An Article Distributed Across Jihadist Forums\n By SITE Instute \n September 9, 2005 \n \n \n An article charging that Switzerland is the \"most contemptible among the enemies of Islam\" was recently disseminated across several jihadist and password-protected al-Qaeda affiliated forums. The document, originally authored by Colonel Doctor Muhammad al-Ghanam, the former Director of Legal Investigations in the Egyptian Ministry of Interior and a political refugee in Switzerland, explains the alleged false guise of Swiss neutrality, not only on a political level, but on a personal level in light of al-Ghanam's own experiences. \n \n Switzerland is branded one of the \"most dangerous links in the 'international pact of the cross',\" due to its continued participation in the occupation of Iraq, cooperation with the \"current renegade regime\" in Egypt, and applying pressure on Turkey because of its government has become half-Islamic. Al-Ghanam avers that the Swiss neutrality is a mere fa\u00e7ade that allows it to conceal its \"crusading face\" and penetrate Muslim society to collect intelligence. Further, from his own experience with the \"aggressive and tyrannical behavior\" of the Swiss, the author alleges that a forceful attempt was made upon him to infiltrate al-Qaeda groups, that he refused, and he was subsequently arrested under \"some pretext.\" He states: \"freedom of opinion is nothing but a war against Islam.\" \n \n \n Concluding the article, al-Ghanam repeats his condemnation of the Swiss government, and reminds Muslims to beware of Switzerland, \"your contemptible enemy hiding behind false claims of neutrality, making war on your religion without your knowledge. However, the Swiss will not slip away with their crimes against Islam and Muslims: \"The day we strike the big stroke, we will avenge.\" \n \n \n The article received hundreds of views on the message boards, where many members expressed their gratitude for opening their eyes to the Swiss. Two such responses: \"We attack it soon and know that they are enemies of Islam and Muslims\" and \"It's not Switzerland only... but it's the entire Europe and in fact, it's all the Jews, Christians, and the non-believers,\" are such an example of the members' views. \n \n \n \n \n http://siteinstitute.org/bin/articles.cgi?ID=publications92705&Category=publications&Subcategory=0\n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1328 Over 40,000 Islamic extremists pose threat to Europe \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1326 Islam's Supremacist Past Is Its Present \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1323 Britain: homegrown terror \n \n See also http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1312 The Myth of Islamic Tolerance \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1309 Inside the sect that loves terror \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1303 Multiculturalism, Tolerance and Pluralism in Islam \n \n See also: \n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1240 \n Daughters of France, Daughters of Allah \n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1237\n Triple-pronged Jihad -- Military, Economic and Cultural\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1175\n Europe -- Thy Name Is Cowardice\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1136\n The Death of Multiculturalism: Why Europe is starting to lose its faith in Islam\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/786\n French flee Muslim Ghettos Due to Violence and Crime\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/718\n Islamic concept of Al-Taqiyah to infiltrate and destroy kafir countries\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/589\n The New French Revolution: How France is coming to grips with roving bands of Islamic rapists\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/355\n Jihad in Suburban Paris\n \n See also: \n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/293 \n Radical Islam finds a haven in Europe\n \n See also: \n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/67\n Britain joins European crackdown on migrants \n \n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/35\n Muslims inability to integrate into French society demand France to change",

But the fulfillment of prophesy cannot be ignored:\n 1) Reemergence of Israel as a nation.(this is signifigant)\n 2) The falling away and corruption of mainstream churches\n 3) Increased lawlessness and deviance in society.\n 4) Microchip technology that allows personal info to be stored subdermally in the right hand or forehead\n 5) The emergence of a one-world government through either the UN or EU\n 6) The emergence of a one-world religion through the WCC\n 7) The increased persecution of Christians worldwide\n So, I do believe that Revelation is true, but I also recognize that there is symbolism because of the cultural analogies of the time emoticon_xangel emoticon_xangel\n\n \n My emphasize.... emoticon_rolleyes",
