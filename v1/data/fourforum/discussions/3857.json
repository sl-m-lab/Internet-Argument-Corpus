   "Heh, two good answers back to back!\n \n OK, I'll take a half-way serious stab at it, but I'll limit it to pictures (visual, static art)\n \n The human mind is not some blank sponge ready to soak up stuff.\n Our brain evolved, like it or not, for a purpose, survival primarily it seems, and the myriad of complexities that go along with it.\n \n Ultimately, having \"feelings\" or getting \"impressions\" when observing things is part of how our mind is built. It serves us well. It helps us identify hot memebers of the opposite sex who will give our offspring a good chance to also be \"hot\" and better at reproducing (OK, not so serious), we fear things like the shape of a snake, even at an age before we've seen or heard what a snake is (negative response), we can get dizzy looking at some art, and colors in general are supposed to have some impact on mood.\n \n The net result is, once we were aware that we got some \"feeling\", ideally pleasure, from visual stimuli, we tried to get some more pleasure. Ultimately what works in art is what works. It's not a complete science, by any means...to turn art into a pure work of science would require us to figure out the entire human body first..which is a very long way off. So we're left with trial and error. Here (scribble scribble), like this? No..ok..how about this?\n \n That's the pleasure aspect. Another aspect is the rational aspect. The \"meaning\" a particular work of art has to the observer. Think TIME magainze photos that seem to \"capture\" a feeling or emotion, or represent some quality that we hold dear.\n \n I liked JP and DZs answer better :/, and putting the two together, it basically says the same thing \"feels good, some people like it\".\n \n -Mach",
