   "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n MK Uri Ariel (National Union) urged the army to hunt down those who killed the six Givati Brigade soldiers in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, even at the price of harming innocent people. \n \n \"Do what you need to do. This house supports you,\" said Ariel \n \n http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1084251781259 \n \n That's funny I didn't know this was a new credo of Israel, it sounds like the plan they've been taking since the beginning. It's a little more reinforcing when they just come right out and say it like that. I guess you have to give Israel a little credit, at least they're trying to get militants now. There was a time when they'd just burn your house down and kill your family. I'm just suprised Ariel even refers to Palestinians as people because his party doesn't treat them like they are. But hey I'm not trying to knock the conservative Israelis in the Knesset because they are just trying to keep Israel safe by occupying a people for 37 years. \n \n Here's a thought as well. Is killing six IDF soldiers from an army that is an occupying nation terrorism? \n \n Remi",
