More extensive evidence, largely ignored or brushed over by most of the agnostic scientific community, is contained in the excellent book In the Beginning by Walter T. Brown. More on that later. Let's first look at:\n \n The Male - Female Problem\n \n The simplest and most compelling argument for Creation is the male/female pairing issue. \n \n Abstract: If an animal mates with another animal not of its exact species, the result will be a sterile creature (e.g. a horse mating with a donkey produces a sterile mule). If animals of a given species mate and produce an abnormal offspring (i.e. a mutant), it also is sterile. Therefore, how could the macro evolutionary process advance? How could a \"mutant\" (i.e. advances in form) reproduce? It would first have to be fertile itself. It would have to find a sexually compatible mate who was also fertile during its relatively miniscule life span on the overall evolutionary time scale. Thirdly, their offspring would also have to be fertile and be able to continue the advance. So if single celled animals formed in the primordial soup and they were asexual (not have either male or female characteristics, but reproducing by themselves, how would they advance to a hermaphroditic state (having both male and female sexual organs) and then to the higher orders of animals which almost always have distinct male and female reproductive organs? All in-between states are sterile. \n \n The Details: Evolution can only explain asexual or self-fertilizing hermaphroditic reproduction. Yet we have tens of thousands of the higher orders of species with perfectly matched sexually sets of males and females. And any deviations from a normal union and offspring is sterile (not capable of reproduction). Why? How could evolutionary processes possibly explain what we see all around us today?\n \n In short, the theory of evolution states that lower life evolved over eons into higher life forms. Many lower life forms (generally single cells or plants) are asexual, which is what one would expect if the theory of evolution had any validity. If the evolutionary process was to continue however, we would expect the continuation of asexual characteristics or possibly hermaphroditic characteristics (i.e. having both sets of sexual reproductive organs). Moreover, an evolving hermaphroditic creature should be able to self-fertilize itself. Without asexual characteristics or self-fertilizing hermaphroditic characteristics, how possibly could a mutant entity reproduce? The chance of such a mutant finding an exact complementary mate within its lifespan would be extremely remote given the infrequency of mutations, and especially fertile mutations.\n \n Yet scientific observation reveals that of all the hermaphroditic creatures, only the flatworm is self-fertilizing. Moreover, there are no (or a statistically insignificant number of) creatures that we might suppose or rationalize as evolving. Given the eons of time for evolution to take place,we should expect to see many creatures at all stages of the evolutionary process. But we don't see any missing links to speak of, or creatures in transition. (Once in a while some \"scientist\" will speculate and publish some \"finding\" which is generally discarded later)\n \n When we find a mutant in the higher level creatures, it is nearly always sterile. Furthermore, the offspring of cross specie types are always sterile (such as the mule, an offspring of a horse and donkey or the offspring of one type of dolphin mating with another type of dolphin.).\n \n Again, how can possibly sterile creatures reproduce and continue the evolutionary process?

   "From the link above:\n \n Creation's Tiny Mysteries\n \n The second most compelling evidence for instantaneous creation pertains to the spherical halos caused by the decay of a radioactive core. These halos are found by the trillions in all Precambrian granites, the foundation stones of the earth's crust. More particularly they are found in biotite, the mica portion of the granite. \n \n As a radioactive particle decays, it progresses through a well know set of elements and isotopes, emitting Beta or Alpha particles of given MeV (Million electron Volts). When alpha particles are emitted by a radioactive speck in a given substrate or material, the alpha particles \"run out of energy\" a certain distance away from the core and leave a \"damage\" sphere or ring (when cross-sectioned). See illustrations below. By measuring the diameter of the damaged ring, and also noting the various rings around a core, its fairly straightforward to determine what the exact center core particle was to begin with. \n \n Reviewing: By\n \n understanding the energy levels of particles being emitted from the radioactive core, and\n determining how far those \"energetic\" particles would travel in the material, (leaving a \"sphere\" of damage as the particles came to a halt), and\n slicing a halo and measuring the halo ring diameters under a microscope, and\n understanding the elements and isotopes that the core material progresses through as it radioactively decays,\n it is easily possible to accurately determine what the composition was of the original radioactive material encased in the substrate.\n \n Following are some illustrations of Polonium halos and photographs of actual cross-sections of halos of those isotopes.\n \n \n \n 210 Po Halo Cross Section\n \n Idealized three-dimensional illustration of a 210 Po halo obtained by slicing the halo through the center. Each halo ring is identified by the appropriate isotope and its alpha energy in MeV (Million electron Volts)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 214 Po Halo Cross Section\n \n Idealized three-dimensional illustration of a 214 Po halo obtained by slicing the halo through the center. Each halo ring is identified by the appropriate isotope and its alpha energy in MeV (Million electron Volts)\n \n \n \n \n \n 218 Po Halo Cross Section\n \n Idealized three-dimensional illustration of a 218 Po halo obtained by slicing the halo through the center. Each halo ring is identified by the appropriate isotope and its alpha energy in MeV (Million electron Volts)\n \n \n \n Adapted from Creation's Tiny Mysteries by Robert V. Gentry. Published by Earth Science Associates, Knoxville, TN. \n Copyright Robert V. Gentry. All rights reserved.\n \n Robert Gentry, a government laboratory researcher discovered that many halos were caused by original (not secondary) particles of Polonium 210 (210Po), Polonium 214 and Polonium 218.\n \n The half-lives of the Polonium isotopes are as follows:\n Polonium 210 half-life = 138.4 days\n Polonium 214 half-life = 164 microseconds\n Polonium 218 half-life = 3 minutes\n \n The radioactivity of these cores are of course long extinct.\n \n Now here's the kicker. How could the Precambrian granites, which scientists state formed over millions of years, possibly contains evidence that would have taken only a few minutes to disappear? \n \n Gentry wondered too, and published his findings in some of the leading scientific journals, hoping there might be some adequate response. But there wasn't. The most common approach of the scientific community was to ignore the evidence and many journals refused to publish his work. There never was a satisfactory answer.\n \n There are only two ways that the phenomena of having a 3-minute half-life particle entrapped in granite could have occurred. \n \n the granite substrate surrounding the Polonium core particle was instantaneously formed around the particle (at least in under three minutes), or\n the substrate surrounded a non-radioactive Polonium core particle and sometime later, the particle became radioactive.\n The first option can only have come about through instantaneous creation. The second at some later event (such as the Fall of Adam) at which time the death causing process of radioactivity on earth may have begun.\n \n The first option seems the more reasonable of the two. God spoke and the land (granites included) instantly formed. God left His fingerprint inside these foundation stones and left evidence that will stand forever.\n \n For an excellent and full dissertation on these halos, get Robert Gentry's excellent book, Creation's Tiny Mysteries published by Earth Sciences Associates, Knoxville, Tennessee.",

   "Evidence for a Young Universe\n \n Following is a list of natural phenomena, adapted from an article entitled Evidence for a Young Universe, by D. Russell Humphreys of the Creation Science Fellowship of New Mexico, P.O. Box 10550, Albuquerque, NM 87184.\n \n Current evolutionary science states that our galaxy is around 10 billion years old and our solar system over 5 billion years old. However, most scientific evidence (90% according to Humphreys) indicates an earth age much less than that, thereby lending support to the Biblical account of Creation. It should be noted that the time periods or ages given below are maximum possible ages and could be considerably less. All quotations and emphasis are found in the original article.\n \n Based on the observed rotational speeds of the stars about the center of our own galaxy, \"if our galaxy were more than a few hundred million years old, it would be a featureless smear of stars instead of its present spiral shape.\"\n Comets disintegrate rapidly as they approach the sun, most surviving less \"than 100,000 years. Many comets have typical ages of 10,000 years.\" (Science says the age of cometary material is similar to the 5 billion year age of the solar system.)\n At the current rate of erosion from water and winds \"it would only take 15 million years to erode all land above sea level,\" depositing it into the ocean. (Science says the age of continents is hundreds of millions of years old)\n At the current rate of sedimentation, the accumulation of sedimentation from the continents \"implies that the present ocean floors have existed less than 15 million years.\" Fossil evidence supports the current rate of sedimentation. (Science says the age of the ocean floors is around 200 million years old).\n Assuming that the oceans had no salt to start with, at the current rates of sodium entering and leaving the oceans, the oceans would have accumulated their present amount in less than 42 million years. Using the most generous allowances for evolutionary scenarios, still gives a maximum possible age for the oceans of only 62 million years. (Science says the age of the oceans are around 3 billion years old)\n The earth's magnetic field energy has been decaying at a factor of 2.7 over the past 1,000 years. At this current decay rate, the earth could not be greater than 10,000 years old. (Science says the age of the earth is around 5 billion years old)\n Many erect fossil trees in Nova Scotia were found \"throughout 2,500 feet of geologic strata, penetrating 20 geologic horizons. These trees had to have been buried faster than it took them to decay. This implies that the entire formation was deposited in less than a few years.\" (Science says layers were deposited over millions of years)\n \"Many strata are too tightly bent. In many mountainous areas, strata thousands of feet thick are bent and folded into hairpin shapes. The conventional geologic timescale says these formations were deeply buried and solidified for hundreds of millions of years before they were bent. Yet the folding occurred without cracking, with radii so small that the entire formation had to be still wet and unsolidified when the bending occurred. This implies that the folding occurred less than thousands of years after deposition.\"\n Radiohalos are spheres (rings in cross section) \"of color formed around microscopic bits of radioactive minerals in rock crystals. They are fossil evidence of radioactive decay.\" \"'Orphan' Polonium-218 radiohalos, having no evidence of their mother elements, imply either instant creation or drastic changes in radioactivity decay rates.\"\n All naturally-occurring families of radioactive elements generate Helium (in the form of an alpha particle) as they decay. Taking into account the amount of helium flowing into and out of the atmosphere, \"it would take less than 2 million years to accumulate the small amount of helium in the air today.\"\n \"Helium produced by radioactive decay in deep, hot rocks has not had time to escape. Though the rocks are supposed to be billions of years old, their helium retention suggest an age much less than millions of years.\"\n There are not enough stone-age skeletons to account for the approximately 4 billion Neanderthal and Cro-magnon people that evolutionary anthropologists say lived during the 100,000 years of the stone age. \"Yet only a few thousand skeletons have been found implying that the stone age was much shorter, a few hundred years in many areas.\"\n And there is much more evidence for a young earth and instant creation as well as a worldwide flood.",

   "CREATION, THE FLOOD, AND CARBON-14 DATING\n \n One commonly used argument against the Creation week as detailed in Genesis is that the sun and moon were created on day four. This was after the creation of plant life on day three. How could the plants survive without sunlight?\n \n Having an engineering background with a logical perspective, I don't really have any problem accepting the Creation week account as reported in Genesis. God is the source of light and life (see John 1:4). Light was created on day one (see Gen. 1:3). The sun is incidental to God's light and while modern man sees the sun as the source of life, it is not -- God is!\n \n Revelation indicates that when God dwells in the New Jerusalem, the sun and moon are not necessary to produce light.\n \n \"The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there.\" (Rev. 21:23-25)\n \n Secondly, since God had created the world from water (2 Peter 3:5, 6), separating the water into the sea and a protective cover over the sky (Gen. 1:6-8), this would have produced a very controlled greenhouse. Subsequently, there would have been minimal climatic changes from season to season prior to the flood. Ron Wyatt's analysis of the petrified wood of the ark formation (see the Surprising Discoveries section) indicated that the wood lacked growth rings. Growth rings are caused by rapid growth during warm wet periods (spring and summer) and slow growth during cold or dry periods (fall and winter). Again this supports that the world was like a controlled greenhouse. Given the heat holding ability of water, there is no reason, why vegetation could not survive one 24-hour day, from day three of Creation to day four when the sun and moon were created. Certainly even now, plants do not die when they don't get the sun for one day, let alone in the presence of God, the source of life.\n \n The upper expanse providing the protective cover collapsed during the Flood, combining its waters with those that \"God had placed in storehouses\" during the creation process. These were released in the fountains or springs of the deep (see Gen. 7:11, 8:2, Prov. 8:28). The immense amount of water released, upon forming into seas or vaporizing after the flood, primed the hydrodynamic cycle and rain became a common occurrence. With the protective expanse gone, seasons became more pronounced, thus producing the subsequent growth rings found in trees today.\n \n One intriguing theory posed regarding this protective expanse is that this \"water blanket\" would have been able to absorb the majority of high energy particles caused by solar radiation. (This idea was first proposed to me by Dr. Griffith Thomas). It is these high energy particles that are responsible for the formation of radioactive Carbon-14 in the atmosphere. All living entities, plant or animal life absorb C-14 while they are living, either directly or by eating other plant or animal life. After the plant or animal dies, the C-14 ingested continues to radioactively decay. Scientists commonly measure the age of an object by how much C-14 is still in the fossil. The claim is made that greater the amount of C-14, the more recently the object lived.\n \n However, organisms living prior to the flood would have absorbed little or no C-14 during their lives since there was little or no C-14 in the air that they breathed. Thus using current C-14 dating methods, preflood organisms would give the appearance of dating in the order of \"millions\" or \"billions\" of years old. Even the petrified wood from the Noah's Ark rediscovery mentioned earlier dated (using C-14 methods) in the 100s of thousands of years old. Yet we know that this took place less than 5,000 years ago!\n \n After this expanse collapsed, C-14 would have begun forming immediately in the atmosphere. However, it would have taken some time for the C-14 levels to stabilize to where the rate of C-14 formation equaled the rate of C-14 disintegration, i.e. reached an equilibrium point.\n \n After the Flood and during the time that the C-14 levels in the atmosphere were reaching equilibrium, living objects would take in less C-14 than their modern counterparts for the same time period. Thus using the C-14 method on the fossils of these animals would date them in the tens or hundreds of thousands of years old.\n \n Fossils of animals dying after the C-14 level had reached equilibrium would be dated fairly accurately using current methods.\n \n Thus in light of the Biblical account of Creation and the Flood, it is not reasonable to accept the dating methods generally used by evolutionary scientists for dates prior to and for several hundred years after the Flood. And the student of Scripture has a much surer footing on the Word of God than the theories of man.\n \n With regards to an apparent stratification of various life forms, it is also possible that the dinosaurs and \"more primitive\" creatures could have sank or been buried in reverse proportion to their buoyancy, i.e. denser life forms, such as reptiles and amphibians sank before less dense mammalian life forms. Alternatively, as the fountains of the deep broke open and etched the crack through which they exploded wider and wider, the copious water movement and movement of soils could have \"sloshed\" back and forth over certain areas, leaving stratified sediment. This might explain the general stratification of various life forms in sedimentary rocks, but it does not exclude the possibility that a horse and dinosaur could be buried together by some other means. Footprints of horses and people have been discovered next to those of dinosaurs. Evolutionary scientists have a hard time explaining this evidence.",

   "WHY CREATION IS THE ONLY RATIONAL ANSWER FOR ORIGINS:\n \n It is agreed on all sides that there are only two possible solutions to the riddle of origins. Either Someone made the world, or the world made itself. A third option, the world is eternal and without origin, contradicts Natural Laws such as Thermodynamics and has been disproved with mathematical certainty in the 20th century. As the universe is obviously complex and seemingly well-designed, a Designer should be the scientific default. In everything we observe today, concept and design are the result of a Mind. Furthermore, Natural Laws such as Gravity, Inverse Squares, Cause and Effect, and Thermodynamics imply a Law-giver. \n \n Unless a natural mechanism constrained by Natural Law, by which the entire universe could come into existence and further develop through random process, is found, a Creator must be the theoretical default. It doesn't matter whether an individual scientist has difficulty accepting it or not. As Sir Arthur Conan Doyle so eloquently stated in his Sherlock Holmes series, \"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.\"\n \n Creation Evidence - A Few Brief Examples:\n Lack of Transitional Fossils. Charles Darwin wrote, \"Lastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together all the species of the same group, must assuredly have existed. But, as by this theory, innumerable transitional forms must have existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth?\" (Origin of Species, 1859). Since Darwin put forth his theory, scientists have sought fossil evidence indicating past organic transitions. Nearly 150 years later, there has been no evidence of transition found thus far in the fossil record.\n Lack of a Natural Mechanism. Charles Darwin, in his Origin of Species, proposed Natural Selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple-celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today, both plant and animal. Darwin defines evolution as \"descent with modification.\" However, Natural Selection is known to be a conservative process, not a means of developing complexity from simplicity. Later, with our increased understanding of genetics, it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor. However, this is theoretical and controversial, since \"beneficial\" mutations have yet to be observed. In fact, scientists have only observed harmful, \"downward\" mutations thus far.\n Time Constraints. Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible, there needs to be an excessive (if not infinite) amount of time. For much of the 20th century, it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed. If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred, the age was pushed back in the textbooks. In 1905, the earth was declared to be two billion years old. By 1970, the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old, and by the 1990's, the earth had become 4.6 billion years old. However, Young Earth advocates have identified quite a few Young Earth chronometers in recent years. Currently, there are approximately five times more natural chronometers indicating a \"Young Earth\" than an \"Old Earth.\" Each discovery is a separate \"Limiting Factor\" that places a constraint on the possible age of the earth. For example, moon drift, earth rotation speed, magnetic field decay, erosion rates, chemical influx into the oceans, ocean salinity, etc, all constrain the possible age of the earth. Each Limiting Factor is distinct. If one were successfully challenged, there is still the problem of all the rest. Furthermore, there are Limiting Factors constraining the possible age of the universe, such as spiral galaxies where they're maintaining their spiral shapes despite their centers spinning faster than their extremities.\n Unacceptable Model of Origins. The Big Bang Theory is the accepted source of Origins among the majority of Evolutionists, and is taught in our public schools. However, the Big Bang does not explain many things, including the uneven distribution of matter that results in \"voids\" and \"clumps,\" or the retrograde motion that must violate the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum. Furthermore, the Big Bang does not address the primary question at hand, \"where did everything come from?\" Did nothing explode? How did this explosion cause order, while every explosion observed in recorded history causes disorder and disarray?",

But since it is a clear fact that even if evolution was proven to be false, it would NOT make creation right, I think it is about time we hear some evidence for creation.\n \n Admittedly, I have yet to hear/see any so I am curious to find out if there any at all that does not rely on evolution being \"unproven\".....\n\n \n Well, all Arch could do was attack Evolution.\n \n Your point is proven as well as my poll.

   "\n With regards to an apparent stratification of various life forms, it is also possible that the dinosaurs and \"more primitive\" creatures could have sank or been buried in reverse proportion to their buoyancy, i.e. denser life forms, such as reptiles and amphibians sank before less dense mammalian life forms. Alternatively, as the fountains of the deep broke open and etched the crack through which they exploded wider and wider, the copious water movement and movement of soils could have \"sloshed\" back and forth over certain areas, leaving stratified sediment. This might explain the general stratification of various life forms in sedimentary rocks, but it does not exclude the possibility that a horse and dinosaur could be buried together by some other means. Footprints of horses and people have been discovered next to those of dinosaurs. Evolutionary scientists have a hard time explaining this evidence.\n\n \n This makes absolutely no sense. This argument entirely ignores how fluid mechanics works.\n \n Reptiles and amphibians are not as a classification more dense then mammals. That argument would dictate that a 2 lb rat is less dense then a 2 lb reptile and that a complex 2 lb rat sunk SLOWER then a 5 oz primitive amphibian. \n \n Furthermore it fails to explain why primitive versions of organisms are at the bottom of the strata where the complex are at the top even in the same density and mass ranges. On top of that insane madness, it does not explain how species such as horseshoe crabs managed to get fossilized all over the stratas yet species like the T-rex are only found in one layer. \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics\n \n Another science creationist pretend does not exist, despite their use of it daily.",

   "Current evolutionary science states that our galaxy is around 10 billion years old and our solar system over 5 billion years old. However, most scientific evidence (90% according to Humphreys) indicates an earth age much less than that\n\n Humphreys is full of ####. How about you check out Dalrymple's book? 100% of the scientific evidence kicks Humphreys's XXX.\n \n \nBased on the observed rotational speeds of the stars about the center of our own galaxy, \"if our galaxy were more than a few hundred million years old, it would be a featureless smear of stars instead of its present spiral shape.\"\n\n a.k.a. \"The Winding Up Problem.\" Completely fabricated, based on a complete misunderstanding of galactic motion.\n \n \nComets disintegrate rapidly as they approach the sun, most surviving less \"than 100,000 years. Many comets have typical ages of 10,000 years.\"\n\n Many don't. But they're replenished from the Oort Cloud regularly.\n \n \nAt the current rate of erosion from water and winds \"it would only take 15 million years to erode all land above sea level,\" depositing it into the ocean. (Science says the age of continents is hundreds of millions of years old)\n\n Science also explains this thing called plate tectonics. That Humphreys \"overlooks\" this should make you smell the rat.\n \n \nAt the current rate of sedimentation, the accumulation of sedimentation from the continents \"implies that the present ocean floors have existed less than 15 million years.\" Fossil evidence supports the current rate of sedimentation. (Science says the age of the ocean floors is around 200 million years old).\n\n So he \"overlooks\" plate tectonics twice? He's either ignorant or a liar. Some might say both. Knowing his other work as I do, I say both.\n \n \nAssuming that the oceans had no salt to start with, at the current rates of sodium entering and leaving the oceans, the oceans would have accumulated their present amount in less than 42 million years. Using the most generous allowances for evolutionary scenarios, still gives a maximum possible age for the oceans of only 62 million years. (Science says the age of the oceans are around 3 billion years old)\n The earth's magnetic field energy has been decaying at a factor of 2.7 over the past 1,000 years. At this current decay rate, the earth could not be greater than 10,000 years old. (Science says the age of the earth is around 5 billion years old)\n\n First, it's a faulty assumption. Second, the ion content of the oceans isn't changing. Third, if this method worked, and we used aluminum, we could \"prove\" that the earth can't be more than 300 years old. Oops.\n \n \nMany erect fossil trees in Nova Scotia were found \"throughout 2,500 feet of geologic strata, penetrating 20 geologic horizons. These trees had to have been buried faster than it took them to decay. This implies that the entire formation was deposited in less than a few years.\" (Science says layers were deposited over millions of years)\n\n Talkorigins takes care of this one just fine. I'm just wondering what kind of trees grow to 2500 feet tall.\n \n \n\"Many strata are too tightly bent....\n\n Never trust anybody too ignorant of plate tectonics to understand subduction to tell you about geology.\n \n \nRadiohalos are spheres (rings in cross section) \"of color formed around microscopic bits of radioactive minerals in rock crystals. They are fossil evidence of radioactive decay.\" \"'Orphan' Polonium-218 radiohalos...\n\n ... were addressed above. You have so few arguments that you're repeating yourself, mainly because you don't even read the tripe that you post.\n \n \n\"Helium produced by radioactive decay in deep, hot rocks has not had time to escape...\n\n Humphreys blew the calculations big time. He's been refuted left and right. Do a search on his bogus R.A.T.E. group and find out for yourself.\n \n \nThere are not enough stone-age skeletons ...\n\n Because Humphreys went out looking? How many should we allegedly find?\n \n \nAnd there is much more evidence for a young earth and instant creation as well as a worldwide flood.\n\n But there's no evidence here for creation.

   "There is reasonable evidence to support what we believe but it is doubtful that any evolutionists will accept it so we don't bother to try to produce it. But here is some for you to consider.\n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu5w6hU9H.kcBHIdXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTExcDQ1bmxqBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMwRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAwRsA1dTMQ--/SIG=122shm1qk/EXP=1196480186/**http%3a//www.bibleplus.org/creation/evidence.htm\n EVIDENCE FOR CREATION\n \n Following are a number of arguments why the Theory of Evolution (and that's all it is) cannot be correct, and why Creation has to be correct. More extensive evidence, largely ignored or brushed over by most of the agnostic scientific community, is contained in the excellent book In the Beginning by Walter T. Brown. More on that later. Let's first look at:\n \n The Male - Female Problem\n \n The simplest and most compelling argument for Creation is the male/female pairing issue. \n \n Abstract: If an animal mates with another animal not of its exact species, the result will be a sterile creature (e.g. a horse mating with a donkey produces a sterile mule). If animals of a given species mate and produce an abnormal offspring (i.e. a mutant), it also is sterile. Therefore, how could the macro evolutionary process advance? How could a \"mutant\" (i.e. advances in form) reproduce? It would first have to be fertile itself. It would have to find a sexually compatible mate who was also fertile during its relatively miniscule life span on the overall evolutionary time scale. Thirdly, their offspring would also have to be fertile and be able to continue the advance. So if single celled animals formed in the primordial soup and they were asexual (not have either male or female characteristics, but reproducing by themselves, how would they advance to a hermaphroditic state (having both male and female sexual organs) and then to the higher orders of animals which almost always have distinct male and female reproductive organs? All in-between states are sterile. \n \n The Details: Evolution can only explain asexual or self-fertilizing hermaphroditic reproduction. Yet we have tens of thousands of the higher orders of species with perfectly matched sexually sets of males and females. And any deviations from a normal union and offspring is sterile (not capable of reproduction). Why? How could evolutionary processes possibly explain what we see all around us today?\n \n In short, the theory of evolution states that lower life evolved over eons into higher life forms. Many lower life forms (generally single cells or plants) are asexual, which is what one would expect if the theory of evolution had any validity. If the evolutionary process was to continue however, we would expect the continuation of asexual characteristics or possibly hermaphroditic characteristics (i.e. having both sets of sexual reproductive organs). Moreover, an evolving hermaphroditic creature should be able to self-fertilize itself. Without asexual characteristics or self-fertilizing hermaphroditic characteristics, how possibly could a mutant entity reproduce? The chance of such a mutant finding an exact complementary mate within its lifespan would be extremely remote given the infrequency of mutations, and especially fertile mutations.\n \n Yet scientific observation reveals that of all the hermaphroditic creatures, only the flatworm is self-fertilizing. Moreover, there are no (or a statistically insignificant number of) creatures that we might suppose or rationalize as evolving. Given the eons of time for evolution to take place,we should expect to see many creatures at all stages of the evolutionary process. But we don't see any missing links to speak of, or creatures in transition. (Once in a while some \"scientist\" will speculate and publish some \"finding\" which is generally discarded later)\n \n When we find a mutant in the higher level creatures, it is nearly always sterile. Furthermore, the offspring of cross specie types are always sterile (such as the mule, an offspring of a horse and donkey or the offspring of one type of dolphin mating with another type of dolphin.).\n \n Again, how can possibly sterile creatures reproduce and continue the evolutionary process? They can't!!!\n \n The answer to the male-female problem is pretty obvious. Genesis 5:2 states: \"He (God) created them male and female and blessed them.\"\n \n Click here for a full dissertation on the male-female subject which also shows the possible progressions of evolutionary changes.\n \n \n\n why is it that both males and females have even numbers of ribs? if god took a rib from man, did he originally make man with an odd number of ribs?",

   "From the link above:\n \n Creation's Tiny Mysteries\n \n The second most compelling evidence for instantaneous creation pertains to the spherical halos caused by the decay of a radioactive core. These halos are found by the trillions in all Precambrian granites, the foundation stones of the earth's crust. More particularly they are found in biotite, the mica portion of the granite. \n \n As a radioactive particle decays, it progresses through a well know set of elements and isotopes, emitting Beta or Alpha particles of given MeV (Million electron Volts). When alpha particles are emitted by a radioactive speck in a given substrate or material, the alpha particles \"run out of energy\" a certain distance away from the core and leave a \"damage\" sphere or ring (when cross-sectioned). See illustrations below. By measuring the diameter of the damaged ring, and also noting the various rings around a core, its fairly straightforward to determine what the exact center core particle was to begin with. \n \n Reviewing: By\n \n understanding the energy levels of particles being emitted from the radioactive core, and\n determining how far those \"energetic\" particles would travel in the material, (leaving a \"sphere\" of damage as the particles came to a halt), and\n slicing a halo and measuring the halo ring diameters under a microscope, and\n understanding the elements and isotopes that the core material progresses through as it radioactively decays,\n it is easily possible to accurately determine what the composition was of the original radioactive material encased in the substrate.\n \n Following are some illustrations of Polonium halos and photographs of actual cross-sections of halos of those isotopes.\n \n \n \n 210 Po Halo Cross Section\n \n Idealized three-dimensional illustration of a 210 Po halo obtained by slicing the halo through the center. Each halo ring is identified by the appropriate isotope and its alpha energy in MeV (Million electron Volts)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 214 Po Halo Cross Section\n \n Idealized three-dimensional illustration of a 214 Po halo obtained by slicing the halo through the center. Each halo ring is identified by the appropriate isotope and its alpha energy in MeV (Million electron Volts)\n \n \n \n \n \n 218 Po Halo Cross Section\n \n Idealized three-dimensional illustration of a 218 Po halo obtained by slicing the halo through the center. Each halo ring is identified by the appropriate isotope and its alpha energy in MeV (Million electron Volts)\n \n \n \n Adapted from Creation's Tiny Mysteries by Robert V. Gentry. Published by Earth Science Associates, Knoxville, TN. \n Copyright Robert V. Gentry. All rights reserved.\n \n Robert Gentry, a government laboratory researcher discovered that many halos were caused by original (not secondary) particles of Polonium 210 (210Po), Polonium 214 and Polonium 218.\n \n The half-lives of the Polonium isotopes are as follows:\n Polonium 210 half-life = 138.4 days\n Polonium 214 half-life = 164 microseconds\n Polonium 218 half-life = 3 minutes\n \n The radioactivity of these cores are of course long extinct.\n \n Now here's the kicker. How could the Precambrian granites, which scientists state formed over millions of years, possibly contains evidence that would have taken only a few minutes to disappear? \n \n Gentry wondered too, and published his findings in some of the leading scientific journals, hoping there might be some adequate response. But there wasn't. The most common approach of the scientific community was to ignore the evidence and many journals refused to publish his work. There never was a satisfactory answer.\n \n There are only two ways that the phenomena of having a 3-minute half-life particle entrapped in granite could have occurred. \n \n the granite substrate surrounding the Polonium core particle was instantaneously formed around the particle (at least in under three minutes), or\n the substrate surrounded a non-radioactive Polonium core particle and sometime later, the particle became radioactive.\n The first option can only have come about through instantaneous creation. The second at some later event (such as the Fall of Adam) at which time the death causing process of radioactivity on earth may have begun.\n \n The first option seems the more reasonable of the two. God spoke and the land (granites included) instantly formed. God left His fingerprint inside these foundation stones and left evidence that will stand forever.\n \n For an excellent and full dissertation on these halos, get Robert Gentry's excellent book, Creation's Tiny Mysteries published by Earth Sciences Associates, Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\n this creates quite a task for people looking for god's fingerprints. why would god leave such cryptic and ambiguous evidence as the \"second most compeling\" case for his 6-day creation? wouldnt it be more reasonable that an all-powerful master of the universe leave his \"fingerprints\" in a more conspicuous place?\n \n its interesting that the only \"evidence\" creationists produce to support creation are the instances where they assume that science hasnt conclusively explained a phenomenon. just because you feel that the rings around these radioactive have an explanation that may have doubt about its definiteness, you leap at the opportunity to say \"see! scientists cant explain this! that means god did it!\"\n \n i'd say approximately 99.999% of believers have never even heard of this radiation-emitting polonium core particles, yet believe in creation. also, hinging your belief in creation on this single (and largely insignificant) piece of evidence is dangerous, because it will eventually be conclusively explained and demonstrated by science, and then you'll have to move on to the next physical phenomenon with a shady explanation. its not a good trend. at one time, lightning and volcanoes were also compelling pieces of evidence that creation was real and these phenomena were direct acts of god. inevitably, all of these have been explained by natural and sponateous forces of nature. your polonium core is heading down the same path. in fact, i'd be surprised if it hasnt already been conclusively explained by nature already, and youre simply refusing to admit it",

   "The Male - Female Problem\n \n The simplest and most compelling argument for Creation is the male/female pairing issue.\n\n There are so many misunderstandings and confusions here it is hard to know where to start.\n \nAbstract: If an animal mates with another animal not of its exact species, the result will be a sterile creature (e.g. a horse mating with a donkey produces a sterile mule).\n\n More or less true, and excellent evidence for evolution. The existence of varying degrees of reproductive isolation between related species is exactly what evolutionary theory would predict (but not at all what separate creation would predict).\n \nIf animals of a given species mate and produce an abnormal offspring (i.e. a mutant), it also is sterile.\n\n Patently untrue. Some mutant offspring may be sterile (it depends on the nature of the mutation), but it is not a necessary consequence and most will not be. Whether this is simple ignorance on the part of the writer, or a piece of sly conflation - slipping a blatant fallacy past us by attaching it to a reasonable proposal - it's hard to say. Either way, everything that follows is undone by the falseness of this premise.\n \nTherefore, how could the macro evolutionary process advance? How could a \"mutant\" (i.e. advances in form) reproduce? It would first have to be fertile itself. It would have to find a sexually compatible mate who was also fertile during its relatively miniscule life span on the overall evolutionary time scale. Thirdly, their offspring would also have to be fertile and be able to continue the advance. So if single celled animals formed in the primordial soup and they were asexual (not have either male or female characteristics, but reproducing by themselves, how would they advance to a hermaphroditic state (having both male and female sexual organs) and then to the higher orders of animals which almost always have distinct male and female reproductive organs? All in-between states are sterile.\n\n The assumption that separate sexes could evolve from asexual organisms only via hermaphroditism is unwarranted. The earliest manifestations of sexual reproduction were probably isogamous, as we see today in sundry protoctists such as Chlamydomonas. Selection pressure would soon push such organisms toward anisogamy, and ultimately heterogamy. Hermaphroditism - certainly self-fertilising hermaphroditism - is secondary to the emergence of separate sexes.",

   "And let's look at the fossil record again and ask the right questions in Darwins own words.\n Fossil Record - Are there \"Transitional\" Forms?\n \n Let's start by looking at a few more of Darwin's very honest statements: \n \n Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? Why is not all nature in confusion instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined? 1 \n \n But, as by this theory, innumerable transitional forms must have existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth? 2 \n \n Lastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together all the species of the same group, must assuredly have existed. 3 \n \n Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. 4\n Since Darwin put forth his original theory, scientists have sought fossil evidence indicating past organic transitions. Nearly 150 years later, there has been no evidence of evolutionary transition found thus far in the fossil record. In Darwin's own words, if his theory of \"macro-evolution\" were true, we would see a vast number of fossils at intermediate stages of biological development. In fact, based on standard mathematical models, we would see far more transitional forms in the fossil record than complete specimens. However, we see none -- not one true transitional specimen has ever been found. \n \n Our museums now contain hundreds of millions of fossil specimens (40 million alone are contained in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum). If Darwin's theory were true, we should see at least tens of millions of unquestionable transitional forms. We see none. Even the late Stephen Jay Gould, Professor of Geology and Paleontology at Harvard University and the leading spokesman for evolutionary theory prior to his recent death, confessed \"the extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as the trade secret of paleontology.\" 5 \n \n He continues: \n \n The history of most fossil species includes two features inconsistent with gradualism: 1. Statis. Most species exhibit no directional change during their tenure on earth. They appear in the fossil record looking much the same as when they disappear... 2. Sudden Appearance. In any local area, a species does not arise gradually by the steady transformation of its ancestors; it appears all at once and 'fully formed'. 6 The evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches; the rest is inference, however reasonable, not the evidence of fossils. 7\n Wait. I need to tighten this down! Are there some transitional fossils, or none? If Gould uses phrases like \"extreme rarity\" and \"most species exhibit no directional change\" when referring to the fossil record, that must mean that there are at least some transitional specimens. Right? \n \n Problems With the Fossil Record - What are the Scientists Saying?\n \n Author Luther Sunderland saw the problems with the fossil record, so he determined to get the definitive answer from the top museums themselves. Sunderland interviewed five respected museum officials, recognized authorities in their individual fields of study, including representatives from the American Museum, the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, and the British Museum of Natural History. None of the five officials were able to offer a single example of a transitional series of fossilized organisms that document the transformation of one Kind of plant or animal into another. 1 \n \n The British Museum of Natural History boasts the largest collection of fossils in the world. Among the five respected museum officials, Sunderland interviewed Dr. Colin Patterson, Senior Paleontologist at the British Museum and editor of a prestigious scientific journal. Patterson is a well known expert having an intimate knowledge of the fossil record. He was unable to give a single example of Macro-Evolutionary transition. In fact, Patterson wrote a book for the British Museum of Natural History entitled, \"Evolution\". When asked why he had not included a single photograph of a transitional fossil in his book, Patterson responded: \n \n ...I fully agree with your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutionary transitions in my book. If I knew of any, fossil or living, I would certainly have included them. You suggest that an artist should be used to visualize such transformations, but where would he get the information from? I could not, honestly, provide it, and if I were to leave it to artistic license, would that not mislead the reader? I wrote the text of my book four years ago. If I were to write it now, I think the book would be rather different. Gradualism is a concept I believe in, not just because of Darwin's authority, but because my understanding of genetics seems to demand it. Yet Gould and the American Museum people are hard to contradict when they say there are no transitional fossils. As a paleontologist myself, I am much occupied with the philosophical problems of identifying ancestral forms in the fossil record. You say that I should at least \"show a photo of the fossil from which each type of organism was derived.\" I will lay it on the line - there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument. 2\n OK, I just wanted to complete that loop. In my research, I haven't found even one transitional fossil. Therefore, based on Darwin's own words, his original theory of macro-evolutionary progression didn't happen. Paleontology was a brand new scientific discipline in the mid-1800's, and now, roughly 150 years later, we know that the fossil record doesn't provide the support Darwin himself required. \n \n David B. Kitts. PhD (Zoology) is Head Curator of the Department of Geology at the Stoval Museum. In an evolutionary trade journal, he wrote:\n \n Despite the bright promise that paleontology provides a means of \"seeing\" evolution, it has presented some nasty difficulties for evolutionists, the most notorious of which is the presence of \"gaps\" in the fossil record. Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and paleontology does not provide them... 3\n N. Heribert Nilsson, a famous botanist, evolutionist and professor at Lund University in Sweden, continues: \n \n My attempts to demonstrate evolution by an experiment carried on for more than 40 years have completely failed... The fossil material is now so complete that it has been possible to construct new classes, and the lack of transitional series cannot be explained as being due to scarcity of material. The deficiencies are real, they will never be filled. 4\n Even the popular press is catching on. This is from an article in Newsweek magazine: \n \n The missing link between man and apes, whose absence has comforted religious fundamentalists since the days of Darwin, is merely the most glamorous of a whole hierarchy of phantom creatures ... The more scientists have searched for the transitional forms that lie between species, the more they have been frustrated. 5 \n ",

And it is Patterson whom you must call the liar as I am just posting what he said.\n\n \n Sutherland is the Aerospace Engineer. \n \n And you have misquoted Patterson just as you did Kitts. \n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/patterson.html\n \n Good thing that Dr. Patterson wrote this letter:\n \n \nDear Mr Theunissen,\n \n Sorry to have taken so long to answer your letter of July 9th. I was away for a while, and then infernally busy. I seem fated continually to make a fool of myself with creationists. The specific quote you mention, from a letter to Sunderland dated 10th April 1979, is accurate as far as it goes. The passage quoted continues \"... a watertight argument. The reason is that statements about ancestry and descent are not applicable in the fossil record. Is Archaeopteryx the ancestor of all birds? Perhaps yes, perhaps no: there is no way of answering the question. It is easy enough to make up stories of how one form gave rise to another, and to find reasons why the stages should be favoured by natural selection. But such stories are not part of science, for there is no way to put them to the test.\"\n \n I think the continuation of the passage shows clearly that your interpretation (at the end of your letter) is correct, and the creationists' is false.\n \n That brush with Sunderland (I had never heard of him before) was my first experience of creationists. The famous \"keynote address\" at the American Museum of Natural History in 1981 was nothing of the sort. It was a talk to the \"Systematics Discussion Group\" in the Museum, an (extremely) informal group. I had been asked to talk to them on \"Evolutionism and creationism\"; fired up by a paper by Ernst Mayr published in Science just the week before. I gave a fairly rumbustious talk, arguing that the theory of evolution had done more harm than good to biological systematics (classification). Unknown to me, there was a creationist in the audience with a hidden tape recorder. So much the worse for me. But my talk was addressed to professional systematists, and concerned systematics, nothing else.\n \n I hope that by now I have learned to be more circumspect in dealing with creationists, cryptic or overt. But I still maintain that scepticism is the scientist's duty, however much the stance may expose us to ridicule.\n \n Yours Sincerely,\n \n [signed]\n \n Colin Patterson \n\n \n Clarifying that Sutherland the creationists article simply was not representative of what he said. Which thereby makes you a peddler of lies. But that's old news. \n \n You fallaciously, dishonestly and in no way Christian like argued what was actually a discussion about classification into a argument about how a paleontologist rejects evolution entirely. \n \n But I suspect you will pretend you never made that argument, even when we cite against you in the future as evidence of your lie peddling.\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/patterson.html\n \n You are peddling lies.\n \n Who's next on your misquotation express?\n \n \nMaybe it's because he's dead now. Check the record for faculty alumni. From what I can see his work was around the 1920s.\n\n \n There are no entries at all for him in a website search. \n \n \nResults: No hits on Heribert-Nilsson in Entire web site\n\n \n Seeing about how you peddled lies about Patterson, Kitts, passed off a aeronautical engineer as a geologies and cannot substantiate that \n Heribert-Nilsson worked at Lund University, you're not doing very well",

   "Young Comets \n \n As comets pass near the Sun, some of their mass vaporizes, producing a long tail and other debris (a). Comets also fragment frequently or crash into the Sun (b) or planets. Typical comets should disintegrate after several hundred orbits. For many comets this is less than 10,000 years. There is no evidence for a distant shell of cometary material surrounding the solar system, and there is no known way to add comets to the solar system at rates that even remotely balance their destruction. Actually, the gravity of planets tends to expel comets from the solar system rather than capture them (c). So, comets and the solar system appear to be less than 10,000 years old.\n \n a.

Some expelled comets should have passed through our solar system in recent years. No incoming comet has ever been observed with an interstellar (i.e. hyperbolic) orbit. [See Wetherill, p. 470.]\n \n For the last 150 years, the age of the Earth, as assumed by evolutionists, has been doubling at roughly a rate of once every 15 years. In fact, since 1900 this age has multiplied by a factor of 100! \n \n Evolution requires an old Earth, an old solar system, and an old universe. Nearly all informed evolutionists will admit that without billions of years their theory is dead. Yet, hiding the \"origins question\" behind a vast veil of time makes the unsolvable problems of evolution difficult for scientists to see and laymen to imagine.

   "There is no evidence for a distant shell of cometary material surrounding the solar system, and there is no known way to add comets to the solar system at rates that even remotely balance their destruction.\nActually, there is. Well over 200 trans-Neptunian objects have been directly imaged by various means. All but Pluto have been found since 1992, and way over half have been found since 1998. I notice that of your references, one was published early in the year that the first (third if you count Pluto and Charon) was discovered, another was published two years later, and the third was published in 1974(!). MY GOD!! 1974! I also notice that none of them have anything to do with comet origin.\n \nIf comet formation accompanies star formation, as evolutionists claim,...\nWhy on earth would an 'evolutionist' make such a claim? What does comet formation have to do with evolution? Wouldn't such a claim be more appropriate for an astrophysicist or a planetary physicist to make, rather than a biologist? Are you sure that you understand what you are discussing?\n \nFor the last 150 years, the age of the Earth, as assumed by evolutionists, has been doubling at roughly a rate of once every 15 years. In fact, since 1900 this age has multiplied by a factor of 100!\nAgain, why would a so called 'evolutionist' make claims about the age of the earth. And, of course, calculations about the age of the earth were based on incomplete information. Once radioactive decay was discovered to be the source of the heat emitted from the earth, it was realized that the earth was quite old. I wasn't around in 1900, but I began studying evolutionary biology in the 1960, and what I learned about the age of the earth and the universe back then (not from evolution, but from the science published by astrophysicists, cosmologists, geophysicists, etc.) the age of the estimates of the age of the earth hasn't changed by a factor of 100. In fact it hasn't changed by a factor of 10. And we have learned that the age of the universe is younger than we thought, by about 6 billion years - making it now only 13.7 billion years old.\n \nEvolution requires an old Earth, an old solar system, and an old universe.\nYes, it does. But determining that age is not a question answered by evolution.\n \nNearly all informed evolutionists will admit that without billions of years their theory is dead.\nNo. We know that evolution happens. What would be a problem would be to find the processes that made evolution happen as such incredible rates. There isn't any evidence that it can happen that fast.\n \nRarely do people examine the shaky assumptions and growing body of contrary evidence.\nThat's because nobody ever presents any of that contrary evidence. I am aware that young earthers base their opinion on shaky assumptions (the Bible says so), but no one seems to want to point out any of that growing body of contrary evidence. Do you want to take a stab at it?\n \n Better would if you would actually present evidence for a young earth and a miraculous creation from nothing rather than just posting your confused ideas about evolution.\n \nTherefore, most people today almost instinctively believe that the Earth and universe are billions of years old. Sometimes, these people are disturbed, at least initially, when they see the evidence.\nAs well they might be. Would you mind pointing out some of it? I have never met anyone who has seen any of this evidence that you talk about. It is useless to keep claiming it exists without presenting it.\n \nActually, most dating techniques indicate that the Earth and solar system are young-possibly less than 10,000 years old.\nActually, that's just not true. Perhaps if you actually educated yourself about the topic. A good place to start would be Dalrymple's \"The Age of the Earth.\" Maybe if you learned how and why such dating techniques work you wouldn't look so foolish.",

   "The Poynting-Robertson effect is an effect that sunlight has on small dust particles orbiting the sun. The continuing absorption of sunlight robs the dust particle of more and more of its angular momentum, giving it a tendency to slowly spiral into the sun as its orbit shrinks.\n \n Based on the Poynting-Robertson effect alone, particles 0.001 cm in diameter located at a distance equal to that of the earth's distance from the sun (one AU) would spiral into the sun in about 19,000 years; particles 0.0001 cm in diameter would require less than 2,000 years.\n \n (Strahler, 1987, p.145)\n \n Slusher, in his book Age of the Cosmos (a 1980 ICR technical monograph), argued that the presence of such fine dust in our solar system limits its age to less than 10,000 years. However, Slusher has overlooked several things:\n \n Reflected sunlight (as versus absorbed light for the Poynting-Robertson effect) applies an outward force on dust particles. As a particle gets nearer to the sun, this outward radiation pressure increases faster than the force of gravity pulling the particle in (Strahler, 1987, p.145). Observe that the tail of a comet points away from the sun. As many comets have tails of dust as well as gas, we have dramatic proof of the above fact! We have a case of dust moving away from the sun! Slusher didn't tell us about that little complication.\n \n Another point overlooked by Slusher is the gravitational effect the planets would have on dust spiraling in. Many dust particles would be kicked into elliptical orbits which would greatly lengthen their time in space. A different gravitational effect, recently confirmed with the aid of a supercomputer at the University of Florida, is responsible for a huge dust ring which is associated with the earth's orbit. This diffuse ring is about 30 million miles wide from its inner to its outer edge and about 200,000 miles thick (Discover, Nov. 1994, page 31). Al Jackson and Herb Zook of the Johnson Space Center did the initial work, which was confirmed in much greater detail (and certainty) by Stanley Dermott, Bo Gustafson, and their colleagues at the University of Florida. The details of this ring, which only a supercomputer could work out, explain for the first time why the zodiacal light is 1-2% brighter in the direction trailing Earth than in the forward direction of the earth's orbit. (At certain times of the year, just after sunset or before dawn, one can see a faint glow in the sky due to sunlight being reflected from space dust--the zodiacal light.) We might reasonably suppose that Mars, Venus, and maybe even Mercury have dust rings associated with their orbits. Thus, we have yet another source of long-lasting dust which Slusher has (understandably) overlooked.\n \n Still another effect \"...overlooked by Slusher is trapping of particles by gravitational resonances with the larger planets (Alfven and Arrhenius, 1976, p. 81). So trapped, particles could remain in stable orbits indefinitely.\" (Strahler, 1987, p.145).\n \n What about those comets which sweep through our inner solar system every few years? Comets usually have two different kinds of tails, one of gas and one of dust, and those tails often extend many tens of millions of miles across space. As they near the sun comets are constantly outgassing material. Comets contribute a fair amount of new dust (Dutch, 1982, p.31; Discover, Nov. 1994, page 31).\n \n Even major asteroid impacts on the smaller planets or moons would occasionally contribute some dust to the interplanetary spaces. We now know, for example, that a few of the meteorites collected on Earth actually came from Mars! No doubt some dust also escaped into space during the largest of those impacts.\n \n Some of the dust continually created by collisions within the asteroid belt would, by the very Poynting-Robertson effect under discussion, gravitate to the inner solar system at about 2000 miles per year (Discover, Nov. 1994, page 31). That is, the radius of the dust particles' orbits would initially shrink at that rate. In less than 40,000 years, roughly speaking, some of that spiralling-in dust from the asteroid belt would reach the vicinity of Earth.\n \n To summarize, new dust is constantly being added to the inner solar system. As it spirals in after leaving its initial source, much of it is trapped in various ways by gravity for perhaps millions of years or more or else kicked into new orbits which may greatly increase its time in space. The solar wind actually blows some of the finer dust away from the sun, should it get too close. It is hardly surprising that the inner solar system is still a dusty place after all these billions of years--despite the Poynting-Robertson effect. According to a recent estimate, comets contribute about 25% of the space dust found near Earth while 75% comes from the asteroid belt (Science News, May 8, 1998).\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hovind/howgood-yea.html",

   "Galaxy Clusters\n \n Hundreds of rapidly moving galaxies often cluster tightly together. Their relative velocities, as inferred by the redshifts of their light, are so high that these clusters should be flying apart, because each cluster's visible mass is much too small to hold its galaxies together gravitationally (a). Because galaxies within clusters are so close together, they have not been flying apart for very long.\n \n A similar statement can be made concerning many stars in spiral galaxies and gas clouds that surround some galaxies (b). These stars and gas clouds have such high relative velocities that they should have broken their \"gravitational bonds\" long ago if they were billions of years old. If the redshift of starlight always indicates a star's velocity, then a billion-year-old universe is completely inconsistent with what is observed. If redshifts can be caused by phenomena other than a star's velocity, much of current astronomical thinking is wrong.\n \n These observations have led some to conclude, not that the universe is young, but that unseen, undetected mass is holding these stars and galaxies together. For this to work, the hidden mass, sometimes called dark matter, must be 10-100 times greater than all visible mass, and the hidden mass must be in the right places. However, many experiments have shown that the needed \"missing mass\" does not exist (c). Some researchers are still searching, because the alternative is a young universe. \n \n a. \"In 1933 the late Fritz Zwicky pointed out that the galaxies of the Coma cluster are moving too fast: there is not enough visible mass in the galaxies to bind the cluster together by gravity. Subsequent observations verified this 'missing' mass in other clusters.\" M. Mitchell Waldrop, \"The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe,\" Science, Vol. 219, 4 March 1983, p. 1050.\n \n b. Faye Flam, \"NASA PR: Hype or Public Education?\" Science, Vol. 260, 4 June 1993, pp. 1417-1418.\n \n \"It turns out that in almost every case the velocities of the individual galaxies are high enough to allow them to escape from the cluster. In effect, the clusters are 'boiling.' This statement is certainly true if we assume that the only gravitational force present is that exerted by visible matter, but it is true even if we assume that every galaxy in the cluster, like the Milky Way, is surrounded by a halo of dark matter that contains 90 percent of the mass of the galaxy.\" Trefil, p. 93.\n \n Gerardus D.

   "Every major mountain range on earth contains fossilized sea life-far above sea level and usually far from the nearest body of water. Attempts to explain \"shells on mountain tops\" have generated controversy for centuries (a). \n \n An early explanation was that a global flood covered these mountains, allowing clams and other sea life to \"crawl\" far and high. However, as Leonardo da Vinci wrote (b), under the best conditions, clams move too slowly to reach such heights, even if the flood lasted hundreds of years; besides, the earth does not have enough water to cover these mountains. Others said that some sea bottoms sank, leaving adjacent sea bottoms (loaded with sea creatures) relatively high-what we today call mountains. How such large subterranean voids formed to allow this sinking was never explained. Still others proposed that sea bottoms rose to become mountains. Mechanisms for pushing up mountains were also never satisfactorily explained. Because elevations on earth change slowly, some wondered if sea bottoms could rise miles into the air, perhaps over millions of years. However, mountain tops erode relatively rapidly-and so should fossils slowly lifted by them. Furthermore, mountain tops accumulate few sediments that might protect such fossils. Some early authorities, in frustration, said the animals grew inside rocks-or the rocks simply look like clams, corals, fish, and ammonites. Some denied the evidence even existed.\n \n The means by which mountains were pushed up in hours during a global flood will soon be presented. The mechanism is simple, the energy and forces are sufficient, and supporting evidence (pages 99-305) is voluminous-not just sea shells on mountains.\n \n a. Alan Cutler, The Seashell on the Mountaintop (New York: Dutton, 2003).\n \n \"Nothing is so high, nothing is so far from the sea that we cannot find [shells] of those creatures that only live in sea water.\" Jan Van Gorp (1569), as quoted by Cutler, p. 59.\n \n John Woodward, An Essay Towards a Natural History of the Earth (London: 1695; reprint, New York: Arno Press, 1978), pp. 3-74.\n \n b. During the period 1508 to 1515, Leonardo da Vinci carefully studied the shells he found high in the Italian mountains. He raised valid arguments against all the hypotheses that others were proposing to explain shells on mountains, but he offered no explanation of his own.
