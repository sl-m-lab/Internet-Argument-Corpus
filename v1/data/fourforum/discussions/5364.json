   "Ministry uses dinosaurs to dispute evolution \n How and when did life begin? Ken Ham wants you to find the answer in his $25 million Boone County creation museum\n \n \nSoon, visitors to Ham's still-unfinished Creation Museum will experience his view: that God created the world in six, 24-hour days on a planet just 6,000 years old. This literal interpretation of the Bible runs counter to accepted scientific theory, which says Earth and its life forms evolved over billions of years.\n \n Undaunted by considerable opponents, Ham's Answers in Genesis ministry is building a $25 million monument to creationism. The largest museum of its kind in the world, it hopes to draw 600,000 people from the Midwest and beyond in its first year.\n \n \"When that museum is finished, it's going to be Cincinnati's No. 1 tourist attraction,\" says the Rev. Jerry Falwell, nationally known Baptist evangelist and chancellor of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va/\n\n \n http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050522/NEWS01/505220367",

I will sometime, and I'll post up a fair & balanced report - I can tell you are all open minded & can't wait to hear! :p \n \n It is in Kentucky, but it's only a few miles away from Ohio, and Indiana.

   "Upon reading this thread title , I suppose I should be slighted, but alas, I am not, the truth bears witness on this one. I see that Rev Ham is a Aussie by blood, and a migrate to Ky, that withstanding, I find it pathetic that a organization , even religously based, would see it feasible to spend that kind money on such a endeavor. We have plenty of amusement parks and natural tourists attractions in our area. Twenty five millions dollars could have went a long way in helping the young Christian people in our area to be better educated . ...\n \n Money that could have helped them be educated in subjects or related fields that would help them become better skilled, productive, socially and morally balanced young adults, and as a result, better prepared to enter society in these troubled times. A young person full of the knowledge of creation, fits well in the local unemployment line, church socials and religion debate forums. Please Mr .Ham, enter the year 2005 and contribute to those having to live in IT. The earth is only 6000 years old ???? Please Mr. Ham, I know what part of the pork that notion came from . :) all jmo",
