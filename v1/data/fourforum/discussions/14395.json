   "\n Five myths about gun control....\n \n 1. Guns don't kill people, people kill people.\n \n This anti-gun-control slogan, a perfect fit for bumper stickers, has infected the public imagination with the mistaken belief that it's just criminals, not weapons, that lead to deadly violence. The key question is, really, whether guns make violent events more lethal. While mortality data show that attacks are far more likely to be fatal when a gun is involved, gun-control opponents argue that this difference simply reflects the more serious, deadly intent of offenders who choose to use a gun.\n \n But in a groundbreaking and often-replicated look at the details of criminal attacks in Chicago in the 1960s, University of California at Berkeley law professor Franklin Zimring found that the circumstances of gun and knife assaults are quite similar: They're typically unplanned and with no clear intention to kill. Offenders use whatever weapon is at hand, and having a gun available makes it more likely that the victim will die. This helps explain why, even though the United States has overall rates of violent crime in line with rates in other developed nations, our homicide rate is, relatively speaking, off the charts.\n ad_icon\n \n As Ozzy Osbourne once said in an interview with the New York Times: \"I keep hearing this [expletive] thing that guns don't kill people, but people kill people. If that's the case, why do we give people guns when they go to war? Why not just send the people?\"\n \n 2. Gun laws affect only law-abiding citizens.\n \n Teenagers and convicted felons can't buy guns -- that's against the law already -- so the only people affected by firearm regulations are the \"good guys\" who just want a weapon for self defense. At least that's one line of reasoning against gun control. But law enforcement benefits from stronger gun laws across the board. Records on gun transactions can help solve crimes and track potentially dangerous individuals. Illinois law requires that all gun owners have a state ID card and that transactions be recorded, allowing police to potentially link a gun used in a crime to its owner.\n \n The ban on felons buying guns, part of the 1968 Gun Control Act, doesn't stop them entirely, of course. In fact, most homicides involve someone with a criminal record carrying a gun in public. Data from 2008 in Chicago show that 81 percent of homicides were committed with guns and that 91 percent of homicide offenders had a prior arrest record. But the gun laws provide police with a tool to keep these high-risk people from carrying guns; without these laws, the number of people with prior records who commit homicides could be even higher.\n \n 3. When more households have guns for self-defense, crime goes down.\n \n Fans of the Heller decision in D.C., and people hoping for a similar outcome in Chicago, believe that eliminating handgun bans and having more households keep guns for self-protection leads to less crime. The rationale: More guns enable more people to defend themselves against attackers; there might also be a general deterrent effect, if would-be criminals know that their victims could be armed. Such arguments cannot be dismissed.\n \n The key question is whether the self-defense benefits of owning a gun outweigh the costs of having more guns in circulation. And the costs can be high: more and cheaper guns available to criminals in the \"secondary market\" -- including gun shows and online sales -- which is almost totally unregulated under federal laws, and increased risk of a child or a spouse misusing a gun at home. Our research suggests that as many as 500,000 guns are stolen each year in the United States, going directly into the hands of people who are, by definition, criminals.\n \n The data show that a net increase in household gun ownership would mean more homicides and perhaps more burglaries as well. Guns can be sold quickly, and at good prices, on the underground market.\n \n 4. In high-crime urban neighborhoods, guns are as easy to get as fast food.\n \n There are roughly 250 to 300 million guns in circulation in the United States. That number strikes some as so high that regulation seems futile. Opponents of gun control cite the sentiment of one Chicago gang member, who said in a 1992 newspaper interview that buying a gun is \"like going through the drive-through window. Give me some fries, a Coke and a 9-millimeter.\"\n \n Our own study of the underground gun market in Chicago, with Columbia sociologist Sudhir Venkatesh and Harvard criminologist Anthony Braga, contradicts this claim. Handguns that can be bought legally for around $100 sell on the street in Chicago for $250 to $400. Surveys of people who have been arrested find that a majority of those who didn't own a gun at the time of their arrest, but who would want one, say it would take more than a week to get one. Some people who can't find a gun on the street hire a broker in the underground market to help them get one. It costs more and takes more time to get guns in the underground market -- evidence that gun regulations do make some difference.\n \n 5. Repealing Chicago's handgun ban will dramatically increase gun crimes.\n \n Many legal analysts predict that Chicago's handgun ban is done for. While proponents of gun control may feel discouraged, the actual impact could be minimal, depending on what regulations the court allows Chicago to put on the books instead. New York City, for example, makes it quite difficult for private citizens to obtain handguns through an expensive and drawn-out permitting process that falls short of an outright ban.\n \n Local officials from Dodge City to Chicago have understood that some regulation of firearms within city limits is in the public's interest, and that regulation and law enforcement are important complements in the effort to reduce gun violence. Even before the repeal of D.C.'s handgun ban, the city's police reestablished a gun-recovery unit and focused on seizing illegal firearms. The city's homicide rate has been relatively flat the past several years. If the court decides that Chicago must follow D.C's lead in getting rid of its handgun ban, we can only hope that it leaves the door open for sensible control measures. \n\n Five myths about gun control",

   "This anti-gun-control slogan, a perfect fit for bumper stickers, has infected the public imagination with the mistaken belief that it's just criminals, not weapons, that lead to deadly violence.\n\n \n Because this is the truth. Pure and simple.\n \n \nThe key question is, really, whether guns make violent events more lethal.\n\n \n No, the question is why you let violent individuals remain free in public.\n \n \nBut in a groundbreaking and often-replicated look at the details of criminal attacks in Chicago in the 1960s, University of California at Berkeley law professor Franklin Zimring found that the circumstances of gun and knife assaults are quite similar: They're typically unplanned and with no clear intention to kill.\n\n \n Pure BS. One doesn't carry out an unplanned deadly assault.\n \n \nOffenders use whatever weapon is at hand, and having a gun available makes it more likely that the victim will die.\n\n \n Having a gun available makes it more likely that the victim will like while the offender will die.\n \n \nAs Ozzy Osbourne once said in an interview with the New York Times: \"I keep hearing this [expletive] thing that guns don't kill people, but people kill people. If that's the case, why do we give people guns when they go to war? Why not just send the people?\"\n\n \n Osbourne is a drug addict, with more arrests than one can count. He's been made famous for biting the heads off various helpless creatures while on stage. Why you're supporting him in your gun control movement, I don't know. However using him as your spokesmen does very little to help your cause, and absolutely everything to hurt it.\n \n What next, are you gonna get a white supremacist to endorse gun control as a good idea?\n \n \nBut law enforcement benefits from stronger gun laws across the board.\n \n \n Too bad. Whatever benefit the police are awarded, can't come at the expense of the rights of the people. We don't live in a police state.\n \n \nRecords on gun transactions can help solve crimes and track potentially dangerous individuals.\n\n \n Then show the crimes that have been solved because of a gun registry being in place. Go on and prove your position. You made the argument now back it up.\n \n \nIllinois law requires that all gun owners have a state ID card and that transactions be recorded, allowing police to potentially link a gun used in a crime to its owner.\n\n \n And how many guns found at crime scenes have been linked back to their original owners?\n \n \nThe ban on felons buying guns, part of the 1968 Gun Control Act, doesn't stop them entirely, of course. In fact, most homicides involve someone with a criminal record carrying a gun in public. Data from 2008 in Chicago show that 81 percent of homicides were committed with guns and that 91 percent of homicide offenders had a prior arrest record.\n\n \n So 81 percent of ALL homicides in Chicago involved guns, 91 percent of the killers had criminal records...and you still claim Chicago's ban on handguns is a success and has saved countless lives?\n \n \nBut the gun laws provide police with a tool to keep these high-risk people from carrying guns; without these laws, the number of people with prior records who commit homicides could be even higher.\n\n \n 91 percent of the killers in Chicago were carrying a gun despite the fact it was against the law. What tools do the police have that should have prevented this? And why weren't they using them?\n \n \nFans of the Heller decision in D.C., and people hoping for a similar outcome in Chicago, believe that eliminating handgun bans and having more households keep guns for self-protection leads to less crime. The rationale: More guns enable more people to defend themselves against attackers;\n\n \n Because that's the simple truth.\n \n \nthere might also be a general deterrent effect, if would-be criminals know that their victims could be armed. Such arguments cannot be dismissed.\n\n \n If they can't be dismissed then you lose the argument. Thanks for playing.\n \n \nThe key question is whether the self-defense benefits of owning a gun outweigh the costs of having more guns in circulation.\n\n \n Absolutely. If you save even one life then that's all that matters.\n \n And what's more, owning a gun is as fundamental a right as being able to own a Bible. Don't even try and argue against it.\n \n \nAnd the costs can be high: more and cheaper guns available to criminals in the \"secondary market\" -- including gun shows and online sales -- which is almost totally unregulated under federal laws,\n\n \n Bull****. Prove it!\n \n \nand increased risk of a child or a spouse misusing a gun at home.\n\n \n Prove it.\n \n \nOur research suggests that as many as 500,000 guns are stolen each year in the United States, going directly into the hands of people who are, by definition, criminals.\n\n \n Show us the research. Present the evidence.\n \n \nThe data show that a net increase in household gun ownership would mean more homicides and perhaps more burglaries as well. Guns can be sold quickly, and at good prices, on the underground market.\n\n \n \nOur own study of the underground gun market in Chicago, with Columbia sociologist Sudhir Venkatesh and Harvard criminologist Anthony Braga, contradicts this claim.\n \n \n Funny. You seem to have contradicted yourself here. Which position is the right one? Which one are you going to claim as accurate? Are guns easy to get on the black market, or are they extremely rare and hard to find?\n \n \nHandguns that can be bought legally for around $100 sell on the street in Chicago for $250 to $400. Surveys of people who have been arrested find that a majority of those who didn't own a gun at the time of their arrest, but who would want one, say it would take more than a week to get one. Some people who can't find a gun on the street hire a broker in the underground market to help them get one. It costs more and takes more time to get guns in the underground market -- evidence that gun regulations do make some difference.\n\n \n Then obviously you're lying through your teeth about guns being sold quickly and easily.\n \n \nMany legal analysts predict that Chicago's handgun ban is done for.\n\n \n And it is.\n \n \nWhile proponents of gun control may feel discouraged, the actual impact could be minimal, depending on what regulations the court allows Chicago to put on the books instead.\n\n \n Fundamental right status. That's basically a kill shot to whatever Chicago might try and implement. They might as well just fly the white flag now and give up.\n \n \nNew York City, for example, makes it quite difficult for private citizens to obtain handguns through an expensive and drawn-out permitting process that falls short of an outright ban.\n\n \n Show how this process will prove to be constitutional and reasonable.\n \n \nLocal officials from Dodge City to Chicago have understood that some regulation of firearms within city limits is in the public's interest,\n\n \n No they aren't.\n \n \nand that regulation and law enforcement are important complements in the effort to reduce gun violence.\n\n \n Quit letting the offenders loose. That'll do wonders for violence rates.\n \n \nEven before the repeal of D.C.'s handgun ban, the city's police reestablished a gun-recovery unit and focused on seizing illegal firearms.\n\n \n So then the handgun ban did absolutely nothing. Nice to see you could finally admit the truth.\n \n \nThe city's homicide rate has been relatively flat the past several years.\n\n \n If by flat you mean \"the highest rates in all the nation\" then you're right.\n \n \nIf the court decides that Chicago must follow D.C's lead in getting rid of its handgun ban, we can only hope that it leaves the door open for sensible control measures.\n\n \n So \"next to impossible\" is sensible?",

   "Ohioprof. We can agree that guns are potentially dangerous, but our world is filled with dangers, especially to children who must be taught how to deal with these dangerous items they come in contact every day. \n \n Now that the Anti-gun people realize they cannot take guns from us, because the Constitution protects our Right, perhaps we can get down to teaching Gun Safety, without their anger that the NRA might get some kind of good credit as being responsible citizens! (Unless I miss my guess, In chimes Galileo with his hate for the NRA. emoticon_smile IE Stargazer.)\n \n   Eddie the Eagle.  and   Grant Funding for Eddie the Eagle. /\n \n A study from the early 90's I think.   From a study by the U of Tennessee medical school \n Using exaggerated figures allows health advocate sages to capitalize on the emotionalism of childhood fatalities and thereby evade legitimate questions about their proposal to ban and confiscate handguns as a means of reducing such (p.570)tragedies. We offer the following questions which, of course, are never mentioned in the health advocacy literature on children and guns: If so sweeping a measure as confiscating 230 million firearms is justified because some 273 children under age fifteen die in firearm accidents annually, is the less intrusive measure of banning child bicycles justified by the death of three times as many children in bicycle accidents annually?[226] If confiscating over 80 million handguns is justified because approximately fifteen children under age five die in handgun accidents annually, is a ban on cigarette lighters justified by the fact that four times as many children in that age group die from playing with then annually?\n \n Consider the fact that over 400% more children under age fifteen die in drownings than in gun accidents;[227] twenty times as many children under age five drown in bathtubs and home swimming pools as are killed in handgun accidents.[228] Few people need a bathtub (as opposed to a shower stall) or a swimming pool. If the tragedy of accidental childhood gun fatalities justifies confiscating over 80 million handguns, or all of the more than 230 million firearms, do the much greater numbers of tragic childhood drownings justify a licensing system under which only the disabled and others who show they \"truly need\" a bathtub or swimming pool will be allowed to have them?[229]\n\n \n But this is not the end of the story. The news about gun accidents has gotten even better!   Today's Gun Accident Rates Lowest On Record \n And what a success the program has been! Thanks to NRA safety training, fewer children are involved in fatal firearm accidents today than did 90 years ago, and America's accidental firearm fatality rates have fallen steadily for decades. But now, with the help of Eddie Eagle, that safety record is improving faster than ever before. Since the Eddie Eagle Program's nationwide launch, the annual number of accidental firearm-related deaths among children of the program's targeted age group declined more than 80%. NRA feels that gun accident prevention programs such as Eddie Eagle are a significant factor in that decline.\n \n The effectiveness of the program is confirmed by declining gun accidents among children, its popularity with the schoolteachers and law enforcement officers who teach it, and testimonial letters. These letters relate incidents in which children encountered guns, but, because of what they learned in the Eddie Eagle Program, they sought help from an adult and avoided injury. \n\n and even better yet! \n (this page is no longer available, but the graphic at the end still is.)   Firearm-Related Fatalities at Record Lows; -- Accidents Among Youths Down Significantly \n NEWTOWN, Conn.-A new report from the National Safety Council shows that accidental firearm-related fatalities remain at record lows, and accidents involving youths continue to decline significantly. \n \n The downward trends are occurring even as firearm ownership rises in the U.S.\n \n Statistics in the council's 2007 \"Injury Facts\" report show a 40 percent decrease in accidental firearm-related fatalities over a 10-year period ending in 2005.\n\n Image =< http://www.nssf.org/share/images/declinemap.jpg\n \n Meanwhile the gun supply has been rising astronomically. There were an estimated 250 million firearms in citizens hands before the background checks were implemented. \n \n   Total NICS Background Checks  \n November 30, 1998 - May 31, 2009 \n TOTAL = 115,110,437 \n\n Someone must be doing something right.",
