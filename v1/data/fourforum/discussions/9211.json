   "So because you can't have a casual conversation with a fetus, it does not have a soul? By that same logic, a newborn baby would also not have a soul.\n\n \n At least a newborn can actually feel pain, make noise, and moove effectively.\n \n \n \n \nDo you know for a fact, that a fetus can not feel pain?\n\n \n In the early stages it cannot, but im not for late term abortion.\n \n \n \n \nSo, because she's bigger, she can kill the fetus off? That is generally the idea the school yard bully has.\n\n \n Tell me, are the kids being bullied a hunk of tissue living inside of the bully's stomach?\n \n \n \n \nMy morals are not effecting this any more than they are when I say the murdering of innocent people(non-fetus people, that is) should be illegal.\n\n \n The murder of innocent people (non embryo) is against the constitution. Laws are to benifit society and uphold the constitution, not go deep into morals, which is exactly what you're doing.\n \n Why arent you going on an ant's rights crusade. Many more ants than fetuses are killed every day, and ants are fully formed living creatures. They feel pain, and they can interact. Why aren't you for illegalizing ant squishing or bug extermination?

My hair is human, my skin is human, my fingernails are human. However, a human being is one who has conscious, can interact with others, can feel pain, and can think and has a brain.

It is to benifit living humans and society.

However, we do know that the woman has conscious, and can feel pain. Making that woman suffer because of something in her stomach would be illogical. We don't know anything about humans, but we can take measures to make sure that humans are living happily. The constitution states \n \n \"We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\"\n \n The pro life side says that pregnant women should be forced to give birth. That is defonitaly not ensuring domestic tranquility and establishing justice. It seems completely unfair. Also, millions more unwanted children mean more crime and poverty. Which is not good for society and is not upholding the constitution. It does not benifit our country either with all of these unwanted children and criminals running around, therefore it would be illogical to conclude that the pro-life side is better for our country. We have way too many kids no one gives a XXXX about, why must we need more? It would also be illogical to presume that the fetus is a person. The defonition of a person is:\n \n per\u00b7son Listen: [ p\u00fbrsn ]\n n. \n \n The living body of a human: searched the prisoner's person. \n \n A human or organization with legal rights and duties.\n \n The composite of characteristics that make up an individual personality; the self. \n \n Christianity Any of the three separate individualities of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as distinguished from the essence of the Godhead that unites them. \n \n A living human. Often used in combination: chairperson; spokesperson; salesperson. \n \n \n Obviously, none of these fits a fetus or embryo. The pro life position fails to take into account the rest of society, that we would be overpopulated over abortion criminalization.

   "We should all agree that there either is such a thing or there isn't. Many on the prolife side believe there is. Many on the prochoice side believe there is not. \n \n I sort of agree with you here, but I think its probably not quite so split down those lines. The majority of people who don't believe in them are probably pro-choice but I would guess that most people (at least in the US) do believe regardless of whose line they fall on.\n \n\n Many (if not the majority) prochoice people do not believe in the inherent dignity of women and therefore trivialize them by not acknowledging that they have more inherent value than plants, animals, and dust. It does not surprise me that these same individuals argue that the fetus (a smaller, less developed, dependent human) does not have any inherent value or worth. Yet it is quite strange that they would argue against infanticide, as if all of a sudden because the fetus starts breathing oxygen in a different way than it did 2 seconds before means that it has an \"inherent value\" that they don't even believe in. Ironic. \n\n I don't think many people would really fall in the camp that a woman has no inherent value but a fetus/child does. Its more that value doesn't exist as an abstract concept but instead its a measure of something's worth to someone else. Just because I don't think a woman has more value than a plant or so because of some ethereal inherent value, doesn't mean I think women are worthless - to me it seems that the woman is worth more than the plant in the traditional meaning of the word. I believe there is a reason that women and everyone else should be valued rather than it just being some property of the label 'woman'.\n \n\n Yet, is it not ironic that these same individuals will lash out and say that the prolife person is trivializing the lives of millions of women. It may be true that some prolifers do, but i would argue that they are not truly pro life. The pro life position says that human beings have inherent dignity and worth and not only pay the lipservice to this but walk out this belief.\n If you look at the reasons why we think women have value, then the reason for the lashing out becomes clear - if you don't believe that there is some constant value of a person regardless of their condition, then by forcing a pregnancy on them you are making them less important. If we value the ability to choose and determine our own lives, then by removing some of that you are reducing the overall worth of our lives. To pick a pretty extreme example, its similar to how someone suffering from an incurable medical condition might find their quality of life so low its not worth living.\n \n\n How can the pro choice argument based on this empty perspective have any credibility in this discussion if it denies that human beings have an inherent dignity and worth that distinguishes them from plants and animals. Isn't the idea of rights based on the idea that people are deserving of those rights because they have inherent value?\n Its actually you who is saying here that there is no difference between people and plants - I'm saying that the differences in value exist due to the differences between the two, rather than the only thing adding value to a person is some ethereal quality that can't be described. This is the important point to consider regarding the two points of view.\n \n\n Where is the logic in saying that women are not inherently worth more than a whale, but they are inherently more valuable than a fetus who in two seconds will become a \"person\".\n \n I value intelligence and a mind, as well as not suffering, as three of the most important things there are (their value stems originally from what I am willing to tolerate being done to me more or less). There is a ton of additional things that I think are important, and some of these apply to whales but more apply to women. Some properties that whales and women have in common are not found in a fetus (or at least an early one) and so I don't think a fetus is as important as a woman or a whale.",
