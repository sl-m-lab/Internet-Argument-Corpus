So long as a politician's policies were liberal, those \"outing hypocrisy\" remain mum. There was no mention of Bill Clinton, who supported feminist policies but sexually harassed women on a regular basis. There was no mention of feminists who keep silent on Islamist abuse of women, or gays who ignore Palestinian discrimination of homosexuals.\n \n Sure, the film is outing \"hypocrisy\".

But obviously there is something better than EITHER of those...\n \n \n \nI'm sure there were plenty of hardcore nazis who nevertheless harboured Jews who were their friends or acquaintances, it doesn't do much good to call them on it.\n\n Which thread is doing that?\n \n Oh wait. I get it.\n You're trying to make a nonsense hypothetical about a condemnation that isn't happening, to detract from and ignore the real issue that's going on.\n Yeah. That makes more sense...\n \n \n \nRight now for example, anti-war sentiment is on the rise amongst Republicans, but dropped off sharply amongst democrats as soon as obama ascended to the throne.\n\n I would love to see the substantiation of that, in an appropriate thread.\n That has nothing to do with hypocrisy at face value, and probably more to do with people not recognizing people's real opinions in the first place.\n \n \n \nIt's really more important to look at the facts and arguments around an issue in the abstract, than this ######## identity politics trying to show up particular segments of the population.\n\n Again, I don't see how the two are mutually exclusive.\n \n Even the bible has commentary against BOTH hypocrisy and false worship AND 'issues in the abstract'.\n \n However, for some of these issues, the \"issue in the abstract\" is pretty cut and dried.\n Take Sanford for example.\n Was he right or wrong to commit adultery?\n Wrong. Obviously.\n So there is no real \"issue in the abstract\", is there...\n \n But on the \"hypocrisy\" angle, there is plenty to discuss. Sanford's statements and actions are obviously an attempt to regain political favor. He has shown little to NO regard for salvaging his marriage.\n \n Do the Republicans really want somebody in office who has the gall to ask his wife if he can go see his mistress?\n And then after ignoring the fact that she said \"NO\", he spends five days with the mistress, and upon return he proceeds to publicly humiliate his wife by calling his mistress his \"soul mate\".\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nI personally find it amusing when gays deride the legitimacy of consensual polygamy in order to avoid the \"slippery slope\" argument conservatives sometimes employ, but it's hardly worth having a discussion over. Are they hypocrites, are they not? Who cares.\n\n Quite frankly, that has got to be one of the dumbest arguments around.\n \n Sometimes, arguments of \"hypocrisy\" revolve simply around one set of people ignoring the ACTUAL ARGUMENT involved.\n \n If I think it's improper for a 25-year old man to sleep with a 17-year old girl, but okay for her to sleep with her one day later when she turns 18, is that hypocrisy?\n No. There is a boundary there.\n \n Gay marriage is not the same thing as polygamy.\n In one case, we have people marrying regardless of gender.\n In the other case, we have people marrying regardless of how many times they are already married.\n COMPLETELY separate subjects.\n \n Quite frankly, I find such arguments from the religious right people hilarious because the bible includes multiple examples of accepted polygamy, but no example of gay marriage.\n By YOUR lack of logic, gays could easily turn around and say \"polygamy exists in the bible, ergo it would be hypocritical for christians to condemn gay marriage\"... emoticon_xdonno\n \n Doesn't make sense.",
