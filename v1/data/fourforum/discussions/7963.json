That would constitute proof of sin.\n\n Oh, you've caught me off-guard because I'm not a sola scriptura Christian so in the first instance you're asking me to prove homosexuality is a sin by limitations that other Christians might work by, not Orthodox, nor Catholics.\n \n How does one prove the Bible is without error? The best I can do is to recommend that you go to the Bible contradictions threads or, go to www.carm.org before hand and note that they have a 'Bible difficulties' area.\n \n Thirdly, how does one show that it is inspired by God? Which God would you like me to show is behind it? I would recommend however that you read C S Lewis' \"Mere Christianity\" first which deals with logical deductions that\n a) there is a God\n and\n b) the God that there is, is the Christian God.\n \n However, it's already been pointed out by another poster (unkerpaulie) in a more condensed form that this is a sin\n \n \n \nWell, I'm not entirely sure the two are compatible (and therefore relevant) but I would match the behaviour with the statement. If a man says he is gay, then fair enough.\n\n But the definition of gay is (as sofar defined) circular. He's gay because he does gay things/attracted to gays.\n \nIf he continues to sleep with women, and acts with revulsion towards other gay men, then I'd say he is lying. If he sleeps with other men, and expresses distaste at the concept of sleeping with women, then he's likely telling the truth.\n\n So, if I condemn the homosexual act as performed by non-gay men, is that okay?

They can say what ever they want. It is thier actions against gay people that are at issue. Backing laws that hurt gay people or gay families. I assume by you answer that you as a christian wouldn't mind in the least if a community was majority gay and laws were passed restricting a christians right to practice thier religion or ban it all together. I take it that your answer is yes christians do want gay people to treat christians the way they are treating gay people.

Any- and everyone does and should \"stand behind their legally protected wall\". To cast stones? No, but to hope that the law is upheld in some way. Laws are amended all the time; old laws are discarded and new ones are born. It's the beauty of the democratic process. Laws are passed to suit the majority...most of the time. These laws have, do, and will have adverse affects on the minority, depending on the situation. There is not a single law that will satisfy everyone and I honestly don't think there ever will be. Diversity is pushed in the US in every facet of society, which means there will always be a desire to embrace different beliefs, customs, and lifestyles.
