   "A recent issue of Science had an article (not a research article but a lay summary of it) about some new fossils and where they might fit in the human lineage. There is a debate as to the nature of Homo erectus since they are finding many variations in skulls found in various places but attributed to the same time period. \n \n The article is below, but for those with subscriptions:http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/305/5680/53\n \n The image is attached for your perusal. (Is it human?)\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n ANTHROPOLOGY:\n Getting to Know Homo erectus\n Jeffrey H. Schwartz*\n \n The period from 1 million to 500,000 years ago (~1 to 0.5 Ma) is well represented in the human fossil records of Europe and Asia. Sites containing such fossils include Ceprano, Italy (~0.9 to 0.8 Ma), the TD-6 level at Atapuerca's Gran Dolina, Spain (~0.78 Ma), Trinil, Indonesia (1 to 0.7 Ma), some parts of the Sangiran Dome, Indonesia (1.5 to 1 Ma), Lantian, China (~1 Ma), and probably Zhoukoudian, China (0.55 to 0.3 Ma). By contrast, Africa has been unusually uninformative about this part of human evolution. Three partial mandibles unearthed more than 50 years ago at Tighenif (Ternifine) in Algeria (~0.7 Ma) are similar in dental morphology to specimens from Gran Dolina (1), but the former are rarely mentioned in the literature. The question thus remained: Where are the African fossils? The recent discovery of the partial Daka skull (~1 Ma) at the Bouri site, Middle Awash, Ethiopia (2), provided part of the answer. On page 75 of this issue, Potts et al. (3) now report that the archaeologically and faunally rich site of Olorgesailie, Kenya, has divulged its first hominid fossils: a partial frontal and more fragmentary temporal bone dated 0.97 to 0.9 Ma. Like the Daka specimen, these fragments (KNM-OL 45500) were assigned to the species Homo erectus.\n \n Potts et al. correctly assess the \"Homo erectus\" debate: \"The entire sample of fossils from Africa, Asia, and Europe exhibits wide morphological variation that some researchers divide into multiple lineages and others place in a single, polytypic species.\" They opt for the latter hypothesis and conclude that \"comparison of the KNM-OL 45500 with other crania . . . illustrates that metric and qualitative similarities cut across temporal and spatial groups of fossil specimens.\" Assuming that a vast array of specimens of differing morphologies constitute the same species, favorable comparisons between some of them in one or a few morphologies are expected, especially if primitive retentions and shared derived features are not sorted out. But this doesn't clarify the question, \"What is H. erectus?\" One is left primarily with the traditional approach to the genus Homo: H. erectus is not H. habilis, H. heidelbergensis, or H. sapiens, whatever they are. But there is a simple and systematically valid way in which one might unpack the morphological confusion: Begin with the original name-bearer of H. erectus, the type specimen, which was discovered in the late 19th century by Eug\u00e9ne Dubois at Trinil.\n \n The Trinil skull cap is distinctive in having a very low and long profile with a bluntly V-shaped occipital bulge (see the figure, panels A and B). In rear view, it is extraordinarily broad relative to its height. Its shelf-like, laterally flaring, and apparently rather thin brow ridges flow back smoothly into a gently sloping frontal plane. Near the foot of this rise, in the midline, is a pair of depressions that delineate between them an anteroposteriorly oriented \"keel-like\" structure. The sides of the brain case are minimally puffy. Specimens that share most of these features, but with a wide range of individual variation in their expression, come from Sangiran (panels C, D, and F). Some specimens of this substantial assemblage preserve a temporal bone (missing in Trinil) with unusual morphology: Unlike other mammals, this hominid's intracranial sigmoid sinuses were not single, but arborized prior to draining into the jugular veins (panel E). The Trinil/Sangiran sample also demonstrates that long-touted \"H. erectus\" features--very thick cranial bone, markedly puffy cranial side walls circumscribed by thick temporal lines, and pronounced midline keeling--are only variably expressed, if at all. Only the chunky Sangiran 4 specimen approaches this description (4) (panel F).\n \n (photo caption)\n The skull beneath the skin. Various specimens attributed to Homo erectus. The Trinil fossils (the H. erectus type specimen) and the Sangiran fossils represent the same species and show a wide range of individual variation. Note the odd shape of Trinil and Sangiran rear profiles, variation between individuals, and differences between these specimens and various specimens from Africa and Eurasia (G-L).

Images not to scale.\n \n CREDIT: (A-J) J. H. SCHWARTZ; (K) G. MANZI; (L) KENYA NATIONAL MUSEUM, NAIROBI\n \n Do we see any of the consistent Trinil/Sangiran H. erectus cranial features in other hominid fossils? Not in the Javanese Ngandong specimens (1 to 0.36 Ma), the Sambungmacan (1 to 0.2 Ma) or Ngawi (undated) specimens, or those from Zhoukoudian or any other Chinese site (Dali, Hexian, Jinniushan, Lantian, Maba, Yunxian) (5). Intriguingly, the D2282 partial cranium from Dmanisi in the Republic of Georgia (~1.7 Ma) is H. erectus-like in its very broad and low rear profile (see the figure, panel G) and somewhat shelf-like brows, but it has a single sigmoid sinus, whereas the differently configured D2280 partial cranium (panel H) has a bifurcated sigmoid sinus (6). Perhaps they are related to H. erectus.\n \n Trinil/Sangiran morphologies are also lacking in African specimens, even in OH 9 from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania (1.5 to 1.4 Ma), perhaps this continent's premier example of H. erectus. In rear profile, OH 9 is tall and roundedly triangular (see the figure, panel J). Its brow ridges are tall, more or less horizontal, thickened laterally, confluent across a very bulbous and prominent midline glabellar region, delineated by a depression or sulcus behind, and extended laterally well beyond the sides of the brain case (1) (panel I). Like the \"mythical\" H. erectus, OH 9 is thick boned, its cranial side walls are puffy, and it bears some frontal keeling.\n \n Although first allied to OH 9, the Daka specimen compares better with the Ceprano skull [originally allocated to the species H. erectus, but now is the holotype H. cepransensis (7)] (panel K). They both have tall upwardly arced brow ridges, each with a sulcus behind that tapers somewhat laterally, turns downward medially, and is separated in the midline by a low-set and sunken glabellar region. They have similarly accentuated temporal muscle scars on their sides that emerge high up behind the brows. In each, the posterior root of the cheek bone (zygomatic arch) is forwardly positioned, and the space in front (temporal fossa), through which the temporal muscle coursed, is short (1, 8). In OH 9, the posterior zygomatic root lies far back and the temporal fossa is much longer.\n \n Other African specimens often included in H. erectus come from Lake Turkana, Kenya: on the east, Koobi Fora (KNM-ER 3733 and 3883) and, on the west, Nariokotome (KNM-WT 15000) (panel L), collectively spanning ~1.78 to 1.50 Ma. None of these East African specimens share any of the noteworthy features of Trinil/Sangiran H. erectus, prompting some paleoanthropologists to allocate them to a different species, H. ergaster (9).\n \n Does this exercise clarify the affinities of the new hominid fossil OL 45500? Not yet. But recognizing that \"Homo erectus\" may be more a historical accident than a biological reality might lead to a better understanding of the relationships not only of the Olorgesailie specimens, but also of those fossils whose morphology clearly exceeds the bounds of individual variation so well documented in the Trinil/Sangiran sample. In the meantime, OL 45500 should remind us that hominid systematics must be an endeavor of testing long-entrenched hypotheses, especially when those who turn to these hypotheses acknowledge them as being problematic.\n \n References\n \n 1.

   "To apathy:\n If you want a real creationist interperetation of the article you have displayed, may I recommend that you send this article to the editor as well as your questions at Answers in Genesis? They will get back to you within a week or so....\n \n Some of what that guy was talking about went right over my head, but I will try and answer your questions (NOTE: I am not an expert. Just that no one was answering your questions, I might as well try).\n \n I tend to agree with their methods, since I am not an anthropologist, and I'll take their word for it. \n \n The first thing you need to know is when assumptions are used. The first one appears in, ironically enough, in the first line:\n \n The period from 1 million to 500,000 years ago (~1 to 0.5 Ma) is well represented in the human fossil records of Europe and Asia. \n \n Assumptions are basically unprovable starting faiths or positions (i.e. they cannot be observed, tested experimentally, or even repeated). This also tells you the onset of their minds (i.e. evolutionary) and as such, you must realise that they will come to an evolutionary conclusion. Dealing with fossils as such, is similar to making a jig saw puzzel - only a lot harder as you don't have all the pieces. You have to *guess* where all the parts go - as such already limiting the level of accuracy. This is evidence throughout history. Many scientists have to fiddle with the bones to make it fit their ideas.\n \n They say that they can place certain skulls that show a great deal of individual variation in the same species (h. erectus). If there is such great individual diversity how can they place them in the same species?  \n \n I will not dispute the first fact. Well-defined Homo erectus skeletal types were most probably true humans living after the Flood and expressing bony \"racial\" variation. Not everything that has been labelled Homo erectus - sometimes a few scraps of bone - necessarily deserves the title. Erectus-type skeletons have been found contemporaneous with those of \"modern\" types, and some of the erectus bony features can be found among living populations. Enormous variation is possible between the bones of different types of dogs, such as Chihuahuas and Great Danes. Such variation can be selected for in only a few generations. The \"selection pressure\" from the rapidly changing environment after the Flood, and the break-up of people (after God's forced dispersion at Babel) into small, isolated populations gave ideal conditions for the rapid isolation and consequent highlighting of (pre existing creatd) genetic differences. Such \"racial\" variation could also have included bony features. \n \n Compared with teh very wide variation in other features in the human race, the skeletal differences between erectus and other human skeletons are, after all, not that extreme. Interestingly, Neandertal types (which have larger brain capacities, on average, than today's populations) are now known to have been living at the same time as \"modern\" types. Tools found on an Indonesian island in association with stegodon (an extinct elephant) remains have caused evolutionist Dr Alan Thorne to suggest that these alleged \"prehuman ancestors\" had seafaring skills and technology. As far back as 1993, he said:\n \"They're not [i.e. shouldn't be called] Homo erectus, they're people.\" \n ~ \"The Australian\", 19 August 1003. Dr Thorne was then a paleoanthropologist at teh Australian National University, in Canberra.\n If one uses the evolutionists' own timescales and criteria for classification, and plots all \"hominid\" fossil discoveries on a chart, it will readily be seen that the idea of any evolutionary sequence is a shambles.\n \n \n How can that species still be considered human but different from our own species? Why aren't they considered homo sapiens that have some individual characteristics? \n \n Good question! You might have to ask the evolutionists why they do it! It all has to do with their underlying faith that everything evolved from simplier life forms. Martin Lubenow's book called \"Bones of Contention\" clearly outlines how creationists view the whole human evolution story. I would consider most of them - as some examples are shabby - as being true humans. \n \n My answer to these is that there are major differences that would preclude a fossil's placement into a known species, and that the indivdual differences observed within the fossils in question are not considered great enough to place the fossils within separate species.  \n \n I would agree with that.\n \n Is this good science? \n \n No not really. Science, of course, involves observations, testing experimentally and repeatability now in the present. We know for sure that no scientist was there to see (observe) what these \"creatures\" (assumably people for the most part!) were like eons of years, i.e. what they looked like, their practices, their diet, their intelligence and life style. Almost everything that we are told about these people is based on an evolutionary assumption(s). All what a scientist has to work with is the evidence in the present, e.g. fossils. How scientists interpret the fossils is determined by their beliefs (or belief systems) and assumptions. The picture of what the creature may have looked like (an artist's impression) and their story is based on their own preconceived biasw, and that, ultimately, is all it ever can be.\n \n An example of this is where there is a \"fossil deposit\". Did the animals and plants contained in the deposists live together, die together, or were buried together? Make sure that your answer is consistent with true scientific research (i.e. involves observation, experimental validity and repeatability). You should come to the conclusion that you don't know if the organisms lived together because you didn't see it happen. You also don't know if the organisms died together because you did not see that happen either. All you really know is that they are buried together because they were found together. Therefore, if you try reconstructing the environment in which teh organisms lived just from what you find there, you could be making a terrible mistake. You see, you would be making an unprovable assumption (by true science) if you tried to reconstruct the environment. You would be assuming that they lived together - there is no evidence - but that is what you believe. I hope that you can see how true science cannot deal directly with the past, and how this whole creation/evoultion (and human evolution) is based on unprovable assumptions and starting faiths.\n \n The only way anyone could always be sure of arriving at the right conclusion about anything, including origins, depends upon them knowing everything there is to know. Unless he knew that every bit of evidence available, they would never know what further evidence there might be to discover and therefore, whether this would change his conclusions. Neither could a person ever know if he had reached the point where they have all the evidence. A classic example of this CSI and CSI: Miami. They think it's one person half way through the show, then as new evidence emerges near the end, they find out that it wasn't that person at all!\n \n Sorry about the length...\n Most of the information came from \"Stones and Bones\" by Carl Wieland for improved accuracy of the information I was giving you about Homo Erectus.",
