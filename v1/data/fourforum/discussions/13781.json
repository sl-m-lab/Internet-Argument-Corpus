   "Tom Paine on the Ressurection: \nThe story of Jesus Christ appearing after he was dead is the story of an apparition, such as timid imaginations can always create in vision, and credulity believe. Stories of this kind had been told of the assassination of Julius Caesar, not many years before; and they generally have their origin in violent deaths, or in the execution of innocent persons. In cases of this kind, compassion lends its aid and benevolently stretches the story. It goes on a little and a little further till it becomes a most certain truth. Once start a ghost and credulity fills up the history of its life, and assigns the cause of its appearance! one tells it one way, another another way, till there are as many stories about the ghost and about the proprietor of the ghost, as there are about Jesus Christ in these four books.\n \n The story of the appearance of Jesus Christ is told with that strange mixture of the natural and impossible that distinguishes legendary tale from fact. He is represented as suddenly coming in and going out when the doors were shut, and of vanishing out of sight and appearing again, as one would conceive of an unsubstantial vision; then again he is hungry, sits down to meat, and eats his supper. But as those who tell stories of this kind never provide for all the cases, so it is here; they have told us that when he arose he left his grave clothes behind him; but they have forgotten to provide other clothes for him to appear in afterward, or to tell us what he did with them when he ascended--whether he stripped all off, or went up clothes and all. In the case of Elijah, they have been careful enough to make him throw down his mantle; how it happened not to be burned in the chariot of fire they also have not told us. But as imagination supplies all deficiencies of this kind, we may suppose, if we please, that it was made of salamander's wool.\n \n Those who are not much acquainted with ecclesiastical history may suppose that the book called the New Testament has existed ever since the time of Jesus Christ, as they suppose that the books ascribed to Moses have existed ever since the time of Moses. But the fact is historically otherwise. There was no such book as the New Testament till more than three hundred years after the time that Christ is said to have lived.\n \n At what time the books ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John began to appear is altogether a matter of uncertainty. There is not the least shadow of evidence of who the persons were that wrote them, nor at what time they were written; and they might as well have been called by the names of any of the other supposed apostles, as by the names they are now called. The originals are not in the possession of any Christian Church existing, any more than the two tables of stone written on, they pretend, by the finger of God, upon Mount Sinai, and given to Moses, are in the possession of the Jews. And even if they were, there is no possibility of proving the handwriting in either case. At the time those books were written there was no printing, and consequently there could be no publication, otherwise than by written copies, which any man might make or alter at pleasure, and call them originals. Can we suppose it is consistent with the wisdom of the Almighty, to commit himself and his will to man upon such precarious means as these, or that it is consistent we should pin our faith upon such uncertainties? We cannot make, nor alter, nor even imitate so much as one blade of grass that he has made, and yet we can make or alter words of God as easily as words of man.\nHe has much more to say on the topic. I recommend reading The Age on Reason in its entirety, or at least Part II, which covers the New Testament: Thomas Paine: Age Of Reason, Part II",

   "I forgot to add one more thing from Daniel, which was written centuries before Christ appeared:\n \n \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.\"  - Daniel 7:13-14 NIV\n \n And the high priest answered and said to Him, &#8220;I put You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!&#8221; Jesus said to him, &#8220;It is as you said. Nevertheless, I say to you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.&#8221; - Matthew 26:63-64\n \n Beside Jesus, there's no one in Jewish history who fits that bill.\n \n In Rabbinical literature much is said regarding the Messianic passage of Daniel 7:13. In the Talmud of Babylon Sanh. fol. 98.1, Daniel 7:13-14 is reconciled with Zechariah 9:9. Joshua ben Levy said, \"If Israel are worthy, the Messiah comes with the clouds of heaven; but if they are not worthy, he comes poor, and riding on an XXX (donkey).\" Samuel ben Nachman (270 C.E.) said that according to Daniel 7:13, the angels accompany the Messiah as far as their precincts allow, while God then conducts him to Himself, according to Jeremiah 30:21 (Midrash on Ps. 21:7). In Zohar, Gen. folio 85.4, reference is made to Daniel 7:13 as referring to the Messiah. The Hebrew name \"Anani\" meaning \"clouds\" is a name for the Messiah (alluding to Daniel 7:13) in the Targum translation of I Chron. 3:24. Mention is made of the name of a person, Anani, it is added, \"Who is the Messiah that is to be revealed,\" a direct reference to Daniel 7:13. In the Talmud of Babylon Sanh. 96b the Messiah is named Bar-Naphle, the cloud-man. Rabbis Jarchi, Saadiah, Gaon, Aben Ezra, and R. Joshua expounded the text of Daniel 7:13 as referring to the Messiah. Outside of Rabbinical literature, Justin in his Dialogue 32.1 reports that the \"one like a son of man\" of Daniel 7:13 was identified with the King Messiah in mid-Second Century Judaism. \n \n LAWRENCE HILLIARD, LECTURER, EDUCATOR - TRACTS",

Why is there such blind trust placed on something that changes with each printing? \n \n Looked at objectively it seems Christianity's intent is to turn God's creation, made in his image into a needy, fearful, failure who has no belief in himself to rise above his circumstances and only hopes that he can hide his wretchedness long enough to slip past God's notice to live in a promised utopia that he wants, but knows he doesn't deserve.\n \n Wanna be a good Christian, make God proud he created us.emoticon_smile",

It can be said for your religion or all of them. Take a good look at what that society has become. I'm not impressed. \n \n \nWrong again! I'd prefer all you stiff-necked people repent and receive Christ and eternal life. Then your eyes will be opened.\n\n Isn't that what white puritans told the slaves to control them and make them step onto boats? That's a great excuse! That's a great idea on the way to a civilized society...let's put people in chains, drag them halfway round the world, and make them do the labor. All the while god was there. emoticon_rolleyes God was an excuse.\n \n \nIt's not MY truth. I didn't make the Bible up. It's God's truth, and someday you will know that.\n\n While I appreciate many of the lessons in the bible, and I do apply some of the philosphy found in the bible into my everyday life, it is still nothing more than a revisioned, restructured, and continuously fractured system of beliefs that you so blindly subscribe to. \n \n \nAs for me, I've found the truth, and I'm sticking with it.\n\n I for one am not satisfied with the story of christ and a christian god. I'm glad you believe it...but it really makes no difference to the rest of us who do not believe. It's a story which should be shelved in the philosophy section at the local book store. I for one am not going to waste my life looking at a philosophy that I, in my mind, have written off as false and pretentious a long time ago. I am looking past the mere religion stories to a wide universe that we have not yet explored. We haven't even learned to get along as a people yet. That's really kinda sad, and religion has had a lot to do with it. Think of the discoveries that science has missed out on thanks to religion. It's staggering. In the last 300 years we have accomplished global travel, global war, the dawn of personal travel to ever increasing limits, the ever increasing environmental damage done to the planet, terrible diseases that have been spread by human breeding habits, genious explorers and pioneers that have forged ahead and pushed us to a height of global wireless technology, and global terrorism networks using this system against the religions that have oppressed them. It's simply staggering that people like yourself can't see how that is simply one philosophy to live by. Just because someone does not have religion in there life...they are bad people? Many of the people that do have religion in their life are bad people. It's merely a philosophy of who we are and how we got here. You can believe what you want, but you can prove nothing. We can always discover. \n \n \nYou know how arrogant that is? Basically what you're saying is that only the Christ-deniers know what the real truth is. \n\n What about those of us who have discarded your theories and moved further in our exploration and discovery of who we are, where we came from, what we can find out to advance humans, and where we might be headed as a civilization in what appears to be endless possibilities of other life beyond our known universse? Can't you just let us explore these possibilities without using god to mess it all up? The only person I see around here claiming to know the truth is you...which means you have stopped looking because you became satisfied with your knowledge of the truth. Some of us are are looking past supernatural fairy tales. \n \n \nNow you're starting to make some sense. Feel good about God having created you. I do.\n\n How servile of you. Funny thing is I can see the colonial navy in West Africa cracking whips to control the slaves while loading them on the boats saying that very thing to them in between lashes. All the while god was the excuse.\n \n \nIf it's such a crock, then it ought to be relatively easy for you to be able to come up with something decent. Where's the beef??\n\n Isn' that what the native Americans said just before our christian ancenstors went and killed them and destroyed an interesting and productive civilization in the name of \"manifest destiny\"? \"Wheres the beef\"? Isn't that how we killed many of them, by taking their meat supplies away from them that they used to sustain them. Basically...starved them? That's fantastic. \"God wants us to be here, you need to move. In the meantime, were going to starve you to the point where you are susceptible to disease, kick you out of your native habitat, and make you pay taxes to bankrupt you until you end up disappearing from the face of the earth.\" That's great! All the while, god was the excuse.\n \n I'm not only fed up with christianity, but religion in general. People like you are part of the reason. I thank you for doing your part. emoticon_xangel",

   "The Resurrection of Jesus Christ is one of the cornerstones of the Christian faith. As the Bible says, \"And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith\" (1 Corinthians 15:14 NIV). All four Gospels, and numerous other NT works, testify that Christ is Risen! Bust the merits of the Resurrection and the whole thing crumbles. Show compelling evidence that Christ was never resurrected and you can expect churches to start closing their doors left and right as people leave the faith.\n \n Can the skeptics do it? Can they bust the Resurrection? No one in 2,000 years has been able to do it. I doubt anyone here in these fora can do it, but now is the time. We're (Christians) calling the skeptics out. \n \n Let's see what you've got.\n\n \n OK fine I'll play\n \n There is no way to prove conclusively that the resurrection occurred or did not occur. The best that can be hoped for is that evidence in support of one position is more compelling than the other. Those who believe one way will most likely not be swayed to the other side regardless of the voracity of the information provided. \n With that in mind I will address 3 points that undermine the resurrection as having happened. You can stick to my 3 or you refute and introduce 3 points that support the resurrection having occurred. Let's try and keep it to that as any more will make each response very lengthy. I can read the various opinions concerning the resurrection so I would prefer that cut and paste be kept to a link to source references and any arguments be in your own words. Sound fair enough?\n The empty tomb - This is one of the most used arguments in support of the resurrection and one of the easiest I believe to offer a valid alternative explanation to the resurrection. Jesus died the on the Friday before Passover. He was found guilty not once but twice. Strange that none of the Apostles appeared at either trial in his defense. They would have been permitted at both. Executed under Roman law, buried under Jewish law. Having died just before sunset the body was removed according to Jewish law. There would have not been enough time to properly dress the body before sundown. Jewish law allows for a temporary extension of the time a body must be buried for circumstances as this. The fact that the body had not been properly prepared is evidenced by the Gospels. The empty tomb was discovered by the women whose purpose was to complete the burial. Again, notice the Apostles are nowhere to be found. Jewish law further states that should there be no relatives of a deceased person the priests, even the high priest, are obligated by God to perform the burial. Furthermore Jesus would not have been allowed to remain in the tomb he was left in. Not only would it have caused an uproar bythe families of those buried nearby, he would have been considered a wicked spirit, causing grief to those who were righteous in life. There was a separate burial place for criminals who after a year could have their bones exhumed and reburied having atoned for the sin that cost them their life. Since no one came forward as friend or family the priests would have removed the body and prepared and buried it in the criminal burial sight. The above was in practice and is recorded at the time of Jesus. It does not require one to make any unreasonable assumptions or creative interpretation. Paul never mentions an empty tomb and Mark ends with the tomb being found empty. Although for some reason Christians felt the inspired word of God was lacking and proceeded to add a few more lines.\n This leads us directly to the next issue which is the reliability of the gospel accounts. The majority of scholars today acknowledge that the gospels were not written by the person's they are named for. It is also evident that the gospels are not four separate eyewitness accounts. The events described during the trial and crucifixion of Jesus are filled with many improbable situations. The Jewish Senhedrin would not have tried a capital case at night nor would it have reached a judgment at night and on the same day. Capital cases were heard during the day and judgments were issued the following day. Furthermore it seems unlikely that having found Jesus guilty they would have handed him over to Roman authorities to stand trial under Roman law. The idea that Jews of that time were not permitted to enforce capital punishment is possible but again unlikely considering both Stephen and James were executed under Jewish law. The gospels as a whole have several problems concerning their integrity. While it is understandable that originals would no longer exist due to the age of the documents. The fact remains that we are unsure the originals were copied accurately and faithfully. The Christian bible is notorious for containing altered text. One relevant example is the addition of the last verses of the Gospel of Mark. Even early church fathers who typically are used to support an early dating of the gospels call into question, are the gospels we have today the same as back then. Eusebius quotes Papias writing of the Gospels of Mark and Matthew, but in doing so describes Mark as being out of order and Matthew as being written in Hebrew. Today we have no version of either gospel as such. It is also worth mentioning that the earliest existent copy of a complete new testaments is from the fourth century. The early church once it finally established the books of the bible commonly destroyed any and all other manuscripts deemed unworthy. One of the primary considerations given to any book was that it must conform to accepted ideology and doctrine. The problem with this is obvious, looking at the number of letters written by Paul we see that early churches were often challenged or the leaders were confused regarding their teaching. While Paul was alive those various churches had a source they could turn too to make a decision or instruct them in what was correct. Once Paul died they would've had to figure things out themselves.\n The last I will touch on briefly in an attempt to keep this a manageable length. The resurrection is not compatible with the Doctrines of The Trinity and The Dual nature of Jesus. The doctrine of the Trinity supposes that Jesus while separate was still GOD. The doctrine of the dual nature of Jesus states that he is half Devine. In both instances Jesus would not have been capable of experiencing death as we understand it. Simply put God cannot be killed nor can any being with the ability and intention to return from the dead be considered to have actually died. It is not possible for all three of these doctrines to apply to Jesus. To save the doctrine of the resurrection one must discard the Trinity and dual nature doctrines which would then be additional evidence in support of the gospels not been a reliable source. To accept the Trinity and dual nature doctrines is to lose the resurrection doctrine which ends this argument.\n Oh and one more thing the sacrificial Passover lamb was supposed to be unblemished even if one were to disregard the scourging that Jesus underwent or deem it part of the sacrifices that still does not remove or explain the blemish incurred during his circumcision.",

   "\n The empty tomb - This is one of the most used arguments in support of the resurrection and one of the easiest I believe to offer a valid alternative explanation to the resurrection. Jesus died the on the Friday before Passover.\n\n \n There's arguments he was also crucified on a Thursday or even a Wednesday. Go to Google and type in \"Wednesday crucifixion\" and next, \"Thursday crucifixion.\" \n \n \n\n He was found guilty not once but twice. Strange that none of the Apostles appeared at either trial in his defense. They would have been permitted at both.\n\n \n Not by a corrupt, kangaroo court. Jesus repeatedly exposed the pharisees as being corrupt (see \"Seven Woes,\" etc.), and now you expect us to believe they were playing nice by the book? That's the flaw in that argument.\n \n \n\n Executed under Roman law, buried under Jewish law. Having died just before sunset the body was removed according to Jewish law. There would have not been enough time to properly dress the body before sundown. Jewish law allows for a temporary extension of the time a body must be buried for circumstances as this. The fact that the body had not been properly prepared is evidenced by the Gospels. The empty tomb was discovered by the women whose purpose was to complete the burial. Again, notice the Apostles are nowhere to be found.\n\n \n Once the women found the empty tomb, they told the apostles and some of them went to the tomb to verify it, so your claim is once again incorrect.\n \n \nJewish law further states that should there be no relatives of a deceased person the priests, even the high priest, are obligated by God to perform the burial.\n\n \n Show me where you got that in a first century work, or in the New Testament. Regardless, the pharisees were corrupt and so once again we shouldn't expect fair or lawful behavior from them.\n \n \n\n Furthermore Jesus would not have been allowed to remain in the tomb he was left in. Not only would it have caused an uproar bythe families of those buried nearby, he would have been considered a wicked spirit, causing grief to those who were righteous in life.\n\n \n That's your spin. The NT says otherwise.\n \n \n\n Paul never mentions an empty tomb...\n\n \n Paul never denied the empty tomb.\n \n \n\n and Mark ends with the tomb being found empty.\n\n \n Good, then worship Jesus.\n \n \n\n Although for some reason Christians felt the inspired word of God was lacking and proceeded to add a few more lines.\n\n \n Are you sure Christians did that or stiff-necked infidels or Judaizers? Either way, most Bibles note the distinction so no one is led astray.\n \n All four Gospels verify the Resurrection. \n \n \nThis leads us directly to the next issue which is the reliability of the gospel accounts. The majority of scholars today acknowledge that the gospels were not written by the person's they are named for. \n\n \n You mean the majority of liberal scholars. Conservative scholars aren't so confused. I'd also like to see the poll you took to arrive at that suspect conclusion.\n \n \n\n It is also evident that the gospels are not four separate eyewitness accounts.\n\n \n Neither are a lot of scholarly works on the assasination of Abraham Lincoln, but are they wrong? Did they interview the eyewitnesses? Were they wrong?\n \n\n The events described during the trial and crucifixion of Jesus are filled with many improbable situations. The Jewish Senhedrin would not have tried a capital case at night nor would it have reached a judgment at night and on the same day. Capital cases were heard during the day and judgments were issued the following day. Furthermore it seems unlikely that having found Jesus guilty they would have handed him over to Roman authorities to stand trial under Roman law. The idea that Jews of that time were not permitted to enforce capital punishment is possible but again unlikely considering both Stephen and James were executed under Jewish law.\n \n \n Jesus repeatedly exposed the pharisees as being corrupt (see \"Seven Woes,\" etc.), and now you expect us to believe they were playing by the book? \n \n Also, based on the rants of the Jews, Jesus was executed just like the Jewish folks wanted (\"crucify him!\"), so no doubt they were totally at ease with the Romans crucifying him.\n \n More coming.",

   "\n The gospels as a whole have several problems concerning their integrity. While it is understandable that originals would no longer exist due to the age of the documents. The fact remains that we are unsure the originals were copied accurately and faithfully. The Christian bible is notorious for containing altered text. One relevant example is the addition of the last verses of the Gospel of Mark. Even early church fathers who typically are used to support an early dating of the gospels call into question, are the gospels we have today the same as back then. Eusebius quotes Papias writing of the Gospels of Mark and Matthew, but in doing so describes Mark as being out of order and Matthew as being written in Hebrew. Today we have no version of either gospel as such. It is also worth mentioning that the earliest existent copy of a complete new testaments is from the fourth century. The early church once it finally established the books of the bible commonly destroyed any and all other manuscripts deemed unworthy. One of the primary considerations given to any book was that it must conform to accepted ideology and doctrine. The problem with this is obvious, looking at the number of letters written by Paul we see that early churches were often challenged or the leaders were confused regarding their teaching. While Paul was alive those various churches had a source they could turn too to make a decision or instruct them in what was correct. Once Paul died they would&#8217;ve had to figure things out themselves.\n\n \n Can We Trust the New Testament as a Historical Document? | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry\n \n Are the Bible Documents Reliable?\n \n Are the Biblical Documents Reliable?\n \n The New Testament Documents and the Historicity of the Resurrection\n \n The New Testament Documents and the Historicity of the Resurrection\n \n \n\n \n The last I will touch on briefly in an attempt to keep this a manageable length. The resurrection is not compatible with the Doctrines of The Trinity and The Dual nature of Jesus. The doctrine of the Trinity supposes that Jesus while separate was still GOD. The doctrine of the dual nature of Jesus states that he is half Devine. In both instances Jesus would not have been capable of experiencing death as we understand it. Simply put God cannot be killed nor can any being with the ability and intention to return from the dead be considered to have actually died.\n\n \n You are in error. The doctrine of the Trinity allows for the physical death of Jesus, but confirms the prophecies of the Resurrection.\n \n Prophecies of the Resurrection\n \n IMO, based on Scripture, no one ever dies spiritually forever. They either go to heaven or hell.\n \n \n Oh and one more thing the sacrificial Passover lamb was supposed to be unblemished even if one were to disregard the scourging that Jesus underwent or deem it part of the sacrifices that still does not remove or explain the blemish incurred during his circumcision.\n\n \n That wasn't a blemish in God's eyes. He commanded circumcision. \n \n So far you've struck out. That's about 0-15. But I appreciate your thoughts. Try to stick with one objection a day if you want me to answer it, because that's about all I really have time for going forward.",

Regardless, the pharisees were corrupt and so once again we shouldn't expect fair or lawful behavior from them.\n\n \n You may not like it, but Jesus was not killed for being the son of God. Whether he was or not doesn't matter for this part of the argument. From their perspective the pharisee were acting according to God's law. Being right or wrong about that is relevant elsewhere. If they were crooked it was still in their best interest to act as I have described. If they were honest it was a responsibility given them by God. So either way the actions I describe should indeed be expected. \n \n \nThat's your spin. The NT says otherwise.\n\n \n No actually the earliest accounts don't address it and the later accounts would have no need to. It's not a spin, it's historical fact that those beliefs were practiced at that time.\n \n \nPaul never denied the empty tomb.\n\n \n He never mentions it either. Being a compelling piece of evidence for new gentile converts or to those who disputed the resurrection it's omission is out of place.\n \n \nGood, then worship Jesus.\n\n \n What possible benefit does an omnipotent God get by having someone tell him repeatedly something he already knows? Do you desire your pet to acknowledge in some way it's appreciation that each day you permit it to live, feed it and maybe give it a rub now and then?\n \n \nAre you sure Christians did that or stiff-necked infidels or Judaizers? Either way, most Bibles note the distinction so no one is led astray.\n \n\n \n You answer your own question. The fact that it's in every bible I think rules out the infidels or Judaizers.

Of course there are a number of conservatives that disagree, but their position most often cannot be reasonably supported solely on scientific evaluation. Meaning what they consider evidence are things like these have been the names for a very long time or by trying to create doubt, not refute, but doubt concerning contrary evidence or God was involved or other proofs that cannot be shown to be both reasonable and/or without assumption.\n \n As for Polls\n \n Religion\n Gallup Poll.

MoE \u00b1 3.\n \n Weekly Poll: Who Wrote the Gospels?\n \n \n \n \nNeither are a lot of scholarly works on the assasination of Abraham Lincoln, but are they wrong? Did they interview the eyewitnesses? Were they wrong?\n\n \n Again your missing the point. The Gospels have a number of different versions compared to the earliest MSS in known existence. The earliest complete is from the 4th Century. This means A) The gospels were not faithfully copied over the years. B) When it was decided to address what version of what texts were authoritative 300+ years had elapsed. \n \n The only thing conclusive that any rational person can say about the gospels today is that they represent what the early Church guessed to be the correct teachings of Jesus and Apostles. \n \n Without the Gospels there is no account written or even oral of Jesus. Lincoln has both eyewitness accounts that have been verified and confirmed by other means, accounts by people not present, but shown by verifiable evidence to be factual as well as the confirmation of events that are a direct result. \n \n Lincoln was a bad example, for what you wanted to show it was to recent and had a significantly bigger immediate impact. \n \n Regardless the failure of the early church in it's responsibility in keeping the word of God, the known intentional alterations, the lack of consistency in both the written word and doctrine coupled with there being no real evidence other than the Gospels makes them poor evidence. You didn't make your case here at all. \n \n \nJesus repeatedly exposed the pharisees as being corrupt (see \"Seven Woes,\" etc.), and now you expect us to believe they were playing by the book? \n\n \n No Jesus made claims, but never offered proof.

You expect us to believe that people who believed in God more than you would intentionally break half of the ten commandments without blinking an eye in front of the whole community. Fine maybe a favor or two for a friend, pocket a couple of coins, is not the same as Thou shalt not kill, bear false witness, God's name in vain, covet and a number of other laws. \n \n Do you have any evidence other than the heresay attributed to being said by Jesus? \n \n \nAlso, based on the rants of the Jews, Jesus was executed just like the Jewish folks wanted (\"crucify him!\"), so no doubt they were totally at ease with the Romans crucifying him.\n\n \n Even if that were true the point was why would they? Involving the Romans wasn't necessary and poised the risk of what almost happened and that is Jesus being released. If you are to be believed they could have stoned him that night or first thing in the morning.\n \n I think it fair to say you have not made a very good case against my positions. You have given nothing concerning the empty tomb, the reliability of the gospels was terrible as well as the remaining points which are based on either your opinion with no supporting reasons or heresay from the bible.",

Older Papyrii\n \n Earlier still, fragments and papyrus copies of portions of the New Testament date from 100 to 200 years (180-225 A.D.) before Vaticanus and Sinaticus. The outstanding ones are the Chester Beatty Papyrus (P45, P46, P47) and the Bodmer Papyrus II, XIV, XV (P46, P75).\n \n From these five manuscripts alone, we can construct all of Luke, John, Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Hebrews, and portions of Matthew, Mark, Acts, and Revelation. Only the Pastoral Epistles (Titus, 1 and 2 Timothy) and the General Epistles (James, 1 and 2 Peter, and 1, 2, and 3 John) and Philemon are excluded.{6}\n \n \n Based on what as being the proof text? Portions is how much? Jesus died in @30 - 33 and the earliest to be able to reconstruct is @ 150 years at best later. You find it improbable that portions could have been forgotten, lost, omitted, altered or confused in that time? \n \n Important to note that once the Church guessed what would be the Canon the remaining texts both different versions of books accepted and those not accepted were destroyed or disregarded. Finding anything contrary is very rare for this reason alone.\n \n These sites also seem to make it as if the accuracy were all or none. The NT does contain some historical facts. If it did not have just as many historical errors perhaps an assumption might be justified. \n \n It bases it's historical accuracy on unfounded claims and by comparison to the other documents given based on criteria that do not measure accuracy. Why does the chart only list the % of one other document? \n \n \n \nYou are in error.

They either go to heaven or hell.\n\n \n So that is where everyone who has died is now, one or the other?\n \n \nThat wasn't a blemish in God's eyes.

Circumcision was the means by which Abraham's descendants would be known. Why would Jesus need to be so marked?\n \n \nSo far you've struck out. That's about 0-15. But I appreciate your thoughts. Try to stick with one objection a day if you want me to answer it, because that's about all I really have time for going forward.\n\n \n Let's see if that is true.

At least the scriptures make it clear that things like the inquisition were not Christ-like at all--not to mention peoples' God-given consciences which the scriptures validate. But if tradition had truly followed scripture, the inquisition, for example, may very well not have taken place. Also the current problem of mandated celibacy.\n \n I also think that 'tradition and reason' are not necessarily close enough in nature to be mentioned together in this discussion, or at least the issue of reason is a different discussion. Clearly tradition has often been far from reason in the history of the church. That's exactly one reason why the Reformation took place and the pendulum swung towards sola scriptura. I think the bottom line of sola scriptura is that it answers the problem of too much emphasis on tradition. It was a response to a lack of reason inherent in the over-emphasis of tradition independent of accounts and writings of scripture. I think you have a skewered view of what sola scriptura involves and are a little biased against it. Like anything, it can be taken too far, but it nevertheless has an important role. It doesn't mean the church should have no tradition--rather it means that tradition shouldn't be authoritative like scripture is. I think you're putting forth interpretation as a counter argument here, but that's not the same thing necessarily as tradition.",

   "I think both tradition without scripture and scripture without tradition, and either without reason (and certainly reason without the other two), are dangerous.\n \n I think you confuse tradition with the innovations of the Roman Catholic church which were implemented for reasons of secular power. Indulgences has no tradition in the church, they were an innovation. That said, celibacy can be supported by scripture, it is perfectly possible to read scripture and conclude that none of the Apostles nor Jesus had a wife or children, and hence that all people serving as leaders of the church should be celibate. Indeed this is supported by Paul saying that people shouldn't marry unless they can't control their lust otherwise. I don't think that interpretation is correct, however. The inquisition wasn't a result of tradition or scripture, though one might say it was a result of a twisted form of logic, the cast iron belief that the soul could go to heaven if a person was a believer justified any action to ensure that eternal life.",

John could not be so liberal making Jesus wrong, but that could actually be flipped into the Christians favor. Jesus said 3 day and 3 nights would be his proof to the Jews that he was the Son of God. Well there you have the reason Jews don't believe him.\n \n By the way John says he entered Jerusalem 6 days before the Passover and Mk, Mt and Lk do make distinctions between the Passover and The Sabbath. The Passover is not a Sabbath but the Feast of Unleavened Bread is.

Rom. 4:3) \n 3) Paul is a source independent of the disciples. \n &#61623; But isn't this using the Bible to prove the Bible circular logic? \n b) Oral tradition of the early church \n 1) Early Creed: 1 Corinthians 15:3-8 \n c) Written works of the early church \n 1) Four Gospels \n 2) Apostolic Fathers \n (a) Clement of Rome \"...being fully assured by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ...\"(A.D. 95, 1 Clem. 42:3) \n (b) Polycarp \"For they loved not this present world, but Him who died for us, and for our sakes was raised again by God from the dead.\"(A.D. 110, Polycarp Phil. 9:2) \n 2. They believed it \n &#61623; they were \"transformed from fearful, cowering individuals who denied and abandoned him at his arrest and execution into bold proclaimers of the gospel of the risen Lord.\"pg 50 \n a) Luke \n 1) Acts 4:3 \"And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.\" \n 2) Acts 5:18 \"...they arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison.\" \n 3) Acts 5:40 \"and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go\" \n 3) Acts 12:2-3 \"He killed James the brother of John with the sword, 3and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also...\" \n b) Clement of Rome (A.D. 95, 1 Clem. 5:2-7) reports the sufferings and deaths (maybe martyrdoms) of Peter and Paul. \n c) Ignatius (Ign. Smyrn 3:2-3) \"For this cause also they despised death, and were found its conquerors.\" \n d) Polycarp (A.D. 110, Polycarp Phil. 9:2) \n e) Dionysius of Corinth (cited by Eusebius in EH 2:25:8) \n f) Tertullian (Scorpiace 15) \n g) Origen \n 1)\"...His disciples, who devoted themselves to the teaching of a doctrine which was attended with danger to human life,- a doctrine which they would not have taught with such courage had they invented the resurrection of Jesus from the dead; and who also, at the same time, not only prepared others to despise death, but were themselves the first to manifest their disregard for its terrors.\"(Contra Celsum 2:56) \n 2)\"Jesus, who has both once risen Himself, and led His disciples to believe in His resurrection, and so thoroughly persuaded them of its truth, that they show to all men by their sufferings how they are able to laugh at all the troubles of life, beholding the life eternal and the resurrection clearly demonstrated to them both in word and deed?\"(Contra Celsum 2:77) \n 3) \"Peter ... was crucified head-downwards; for he had requested that he might suffer in this way. What do we need to say concerning Paul, who ... suffered martyrdom in Rome under Nero? These facts are related by Origen in the third volume of his Commentary on Genesis.\" (Commentary on Genesis, vol 3 cited by Eusebius in EH 3:1:2) \n &#61623; \"The disciples' willingness to suffer and die for their beliefs indicates that they certainly regarded those beliefs as true. The case is strong that they did not willfully lie about the appearances of the risen Jesus. Liars make poor martyrs. ... Extreme acts do not validate the truth of their beliefs, but willingness to die indicates that they regarded their beliefs as true. ... The apostles died for holding to their own testimony that they had personally seen the risen Jesus. Contemporary martyrs die for what they believe to be true. The disciples of Jesus died for what they knew to be either true or false.\" (pg 59). \n &#61623; It is not known that they willingly died for their beliefs. They could have denounced their faith under torture or before death. \n &#61623; Based off the early martyrdoms of Stephen and James the brother of John it was well known that suffering and martyrdom were possible risks of preaching Christ's resurrection. This demonstrates a willingness to endure suffering and martyrdom for the gospel. \n &#61623; \"It may be taken as historically certain that Peter and the disciples had experiences after Jesus' death in which Jesus appeared to them as the risen Christ.\" Atheistic New Testament scholar Gerd Ludemann. \n &#61623; Summary: Disciples claimed and believed that they had seen the risen Jesus. \n 1.

It doesn't prove anything about the topic except that people belived it happened, not that it did.\n \n Conversion, belief and the willingness to suffer or die for that belief don't make it real. People convert every day in and out of various religions does that validate Islam or Buddhists? People believe in Santa and The Easter Bunny are they real? Muslims blow themselves up does that validate the religion?\n \n The non-christian authors are 100+ years after that fact and are simply repeating what they were told.\n \n The Christian writers aren't much earlier, but again are only able to repeat what they have been told and confirm they think it is real\n \n Habermas and Lincona aren't very good at making thier case go to infidel.org for written accounts of some of their debates or to The secular web for MP3 and video. William Lane Craig is considered one of the best Christian debaters. I would reference him over the other two. \n \n Over the last few days I have in other threads shown the bible and specifically the Gospels to contain errors concerning the resurrection. While you claim to refute them you actually have not, only saying I am incorrect with nothing to support the claim\n \n I have offered a reasonable explanation for the empty tomb that you just say you don't think so without but don't explain why\n \n So after all this you have managed to post a lot of cut and paste information that is either not relevant, wrong or is based on assumptions and speculation. I have pointed out where your evidence was lacking, but you have failed to refute or even address almost all of my evidence.\n \n So you have accomplished 0, zip, zilch, nada, nothing, nil towards making your case. \n \n Just so you understand responding that I have made a mistake without showing how or just saying you have busted me doesn't make it true. So when you do, if ever, then you cam say it",

Probably source of the information .. Christians. Not independent verification of the event, but\n rather a possible verification of Christian belief.\n \n 2) TF. Highly modified at the very best, and a total forgery at the worst. Since it is correcpted, it has to be shown not to be a total insertion. No evidence has been presented showing knowledge of it from before the 4th century.\n \n 3) Lucian -- Writing in the mid second century, he mocked the beliefs of Christians... this shows he was aware the Christians believed in Jesus being crucified... it can only be evidence of Christian belief, not of the reality of that belief.\n \n 4) Talmud - Written down in the late 2nd century to the early 5th century. Many accounts in the Talmud that talk about what Christians assume to be Jesus of Nazareth are someone else, and the one that might was late enough to be a story that was created in response to the claims of improprieties by the Sanhedrin by the Christians. An account written 200 years later isn't really good evidence of anything.\n \n 5.Mara Bar-Serapion - Doesn't mention the name Jesus, the title Christ, or the method of killing. His entire testimony about it is\n \n \n\n What advantage did the Athenians gain from putting Socrates to death? Famine and plague came upon them as a judgment for their crime. What advantage did the men of Samos gain from burning Pythagoras? In a moment their land was covered with sand. What advantage did the Jews gain from executing their wise king? It was just after that that their kingdom was abolished. God justly avenged these three wise men: the Athenians died of hunger; the Samians were overwhelmed by the sea; the Jews, ruined and driven from their land, live in complete dispersion. \n \n\n \n Now, one big problem with that 1) It doesn't mention Jesus' name. 2) It doesn't use the term 'Christ', 3) It doesn't use the term 'crucifixion', and 4)\n it could have been written any time between 73 c.e. and the 3rd century.\n 5) it contains many historical inaccuracies beyond the 'king of the Jews' reference. \n \n If this is the 'evidence' of the crucifixion of Jesus, (not counting the possible resurrection, boy there is certainly a lot of clutching of straws. A crucifixion of someone in Judah in the first century is not only a possible event, but it has been shown to have happened many thousands of times. To have such weak evidence of something so common place is very pitiful indeed.\n \n And that isn\\'t even getting into the \\'supernatural\\' claim about the resurrection that would require a high bar to be set for the quality of evidence.",
