   "Alright, it's time to survey everyone's thoughts on what, if any, impact the election results will have on the future of firearm ownership in America.\n \n Here is how the Brady Campaign views the election:\n \n \"In this election, the gun issue was in play, gun violence prevention groups won while the gun pushers lost, and there is now a shift in momentum on the issue of common sense gun restrictions,\" said Paul Helmke, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. [bold emphasis added] http://bradycampaign.org/media/?pagename=release&release=851 \n \n Brady obviously views the election as a springboard to offer new gun restriction legislation.\n \n This is how I see it for the next two years:\n \n Firearm rights legislation is dead. No gun owner friendly legislation will get out of committee in the House. \n \n Zero progress will be made on passing gun control legislation of any significance. I do see a push to enact gun control legislation in the house. I see an assault weapon bill being drafted and debated within the first month of the new Congress. Gun control advocates can get such a bill through the house, and possibly through the Senate. But the Senate is too evenly split, and assuming Bush chooses to veto gun restriction legislation, then gun control advocates lack the override majority in the Senate.\n \n The NRA will go back into the defensive posture it had in the 90's, and its membership will increase in proportion to the perceived threat of new gun control legislation.\n \n My prediction is that gun control legislation will be passed in the house, and that it will be packaged under the soundbyte of \"common sense\" gun restrictions. It will then be thrown at the Senate/President with full knowledge that it will be shot down and thereby provide the platform to accuse the \"evil gun lobby\" of \"endangering ordinary Americas\" with \"its irrational obstructionist tactics designed to frustrate the will of the people to enact common sense gun restriction laws.\"\n \n Thoughts, anyone?",

   "This is a tough call. I am certainly more concerned about gun rights with the democrats in control of congress, and frankly I doubt that Bush has the strength of charachter to veto a gon control law. However, I also don't see the dems really pushing for them, either. \n \n In large part, the american public seems to have become disillusioned with the idea of gun control. As the last AWB came and went, it was crystal clear to anybody who is not a complete XXXXX that it was nothing but an expensive, worthless piece of legislative trash.",

   "Gun control is a losing prospect. Even Democrats know this. There is simply no statistics to support restrictions on guns. This issue transverses party lines. I know hardcore Democrats and hardcore Republicans that have opposite views on pretty much everything who shoot at the range together. If the Democrats do try anything with gun control, it won't be until after 2008. That's my 2 cents.",
