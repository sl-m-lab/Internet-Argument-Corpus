   "How did you like Tim Kaine from Virginia doing the reponse?\n \n I live in Virginia and while I didn't vote for Kaine (or kilgore) I am glad he won. I thought he did a good speech and it was very smart of the democrats to pick him. I think some of his content was weak and as a Virginian I was uphappy with him talking about things that are out of his league but it was his job. His best point, I think, was the no child left behind act and the bigger theme of how virginia has worked together (repubs and dems). He is right to say the NCLBA is a punch of bull and is harmful...he is also correct in saying that Virginia is a little more united in our senate and house of delegates. Warner and Kaines strong suites are their leadership skills...they do a great job at this and it has shown in there work. They tend to fail when it comes to issues of social policy. like many democrats they don't like taking a stand on abortion or the death penalty...these issues are important to many and either Warner and Kaine should stay out of them altogether (as in not even talk about them), take a stance saying they will let the people decide for themselves via voting, or take the side of pro-life and and pro-death penalty (with regards to pleasing virginia voters). With judges Warner (if he runs for president) needs to stick with republicans on that one. He can have every other view as a democrat but on that one thing he will not win. \n \n \n Your thoughts on Tim Kaines speech?",

   "I want to add a bit to my point about the social issues...I think they fail because they have more of a \"management\" mindset and social issues are really a thing management of a company deals with so why should a governor or president. I feel this is a negative because the people (whether good or bad) demand social policy answers. Warner and Kaine have a hard time dealing with this because you can't really \"manage\" social policy like you do the rest of the state of federal government functions (schools, roads, etc...). Many Warner should run on his strengths of management and get a VP that will handle all the social issues....if he got a republican to do this he would easily win the presidency and not because republicans are more \"right\" on the issues but because they are able to manage the social issues better IMO. \n \n I hope this makes sense :)",
