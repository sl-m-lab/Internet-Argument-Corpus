You&#8217;ve got to keep in mind that there&#8217;s only been about 80 years&#8217; worth of national boundaries in the ME. Before that the deserts were considered &#8220;a place&#8221; open to anyone willing to cross them, much like the oceans are today. And there are always two sides to every story. Their actions haven&#8217;t been the best, we agree there, but what would any country do that had conquered a piece of ground and had to fight for it over and over again &#8211; on several fronts. I realize that arguments on both sides about the Gulf of Aqaba have merit, and that Israel was a bit of a crybaby about the Strait of Tiran, but they (Israel) thought is was for the betterment of their country. We (USA) sure can&#8217;t trash them for that. \n \n4) They have little land avaliable to place military bases\n It&#8217;s not the amount of land that they have it&#8217;s the location. Really.

If you look at certain items then yes, it could appear that there is a loss. But it&#8217;s up and down, just as it is elsewhere. No need to single out one country. Right now the US is in trouble in every aspect, not just import/export. Just like your 2nd point &#8211; it&#8217;s a game of numbers.\n \n Are we willing to give up that toehold in the ME through Israel? That is the question. We can&#8217;t, IMO.",

I disagree with Israel not with it's people, but what it has done to us. If they WANT to murder everyone in their country, well, that's not my problem. When they sell our weapons to China, attack our ships (US Liberty), and cost us TRILLIONS with little return, well....you get my point. \n \n \nAm I to understand that a country under threat of extermination by Arab dictators and fanatical terrorists since it's founding in 1948 is in any way comparable to the German state after WWI?\n\n \n True, it was a threat, just a very weak one. Israel is staying together because of terrorists. Several major domestic issues are on the backburner because of terrorism, issues that could polentially rip apart Israel. It was said that should the terrorists give Israel a month of pure peace, it would rip it self apart. \n \n \nIsraels actions, however misguided such actions are from time to time, are defensive and retaliatory in nature.\n\n \n But we have not once voted aganist them in a binding resolution.

I care that they are a welfare leech upon America. \n \n \nwhy do we require a military presence in the ME? As you point out, with the exception of Iraq all ME oil producing nations hate us and seem to function well on their own. \n\n \n Protect our constant supply of oil.

   "\n Curious: How did you come to that asseration?\n\n \n Follow the commodity markets, oil in particular. Iraq's situation, with the possibility of it spilling over to the Sauds, acts like a dog on/off a leash with spot and contract oil prices, up and down, depending on how many pipelines the 'insurgents' blow up in a given week. Russia's political problems with the major producer there and Venezuela's domestic problems account for the rest. Add in China's increasing requirements, doubling and tripling every month even though they're trying to reduce their industrial expansion from 15% annual growth. All are tied to producers being near production capacity, which scares traders with the possibility of a shortage. So they bid it up to ensure they can fill their contractual commitments. Which grinds the US down with additional trade deficit but polishes the GDP for political purposes. A cynic would speculate.....",
