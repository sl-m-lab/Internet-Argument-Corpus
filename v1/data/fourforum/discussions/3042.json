   "I've visited the Chechen separatists' site www.chechen.org today and read the Decree issued by Ahmad Zakaev now living in Great Britain. In fact he declared the chief Chechen leaders Mashadov and Basaev out of law! Zakaev is thus the self-proclaimed chairman of the so-called National Salvation Council of Chechnya. Thanks Lord there is at least one sane man among those loony Chechens. Life in Europe as well as the certain relationship with the Britain intelligence has made Zakaev fully aware if the fact that separatist fighters may be only tool or toy or name it with the aliens. They will never be a serious political force both for foreign governments and their own people. Civilized gov-ts are never in talks with terrorists (to say nothing of terrorists lacking unity in their ranks). Well the increasing Chechen migration into Europe is becoming quite an irritant here too. I am absolutely sure that Zakaev plunged into this dramatic decision following influential European forces' \"recommendations\". The involvement of the British intelligence community is quite probable in the context.",
