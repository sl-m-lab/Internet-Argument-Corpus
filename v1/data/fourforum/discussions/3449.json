   "An organization called \"Open Debates\" is pushing for a return to the time when presidential debates were much more open than they are today. \n \n http://opendebates.org/\n \n From: http://opendebates.org/theissue/strengthenmajorparties.html\n \n\n The League of Women Voters faithfully served as a nonpartisan presidential debate sponsor from 1976 until 1984, courageously including popular independent candidates and prohibiting major party campaigns from manipulating debate formats.\n \n In 1980, over President Jimmy Carter's objections, the League invited independent candidate John B. Anderson to participate in the presidential debates. Carter refused to debate Anderson, but the League did not acquiesce to Carter's demands. Instead, on September 21, 1980, the League hosted a presidential debate between John Anderson and Republican nominee Ronald Reagan that attracted over 55 million viewers. The CPD would never, in its wildest dreams, even consider sponsoring a presidential debate without a major party candidate.\n ...\n The nonpartisan League served the public interest well, and it's precisely because the League served the public interest so well that the CPD was created. The major parties didn't want a debate sponsor to include popular third party candidates and employ challenging formats. The major parties wanted presidential debates under their control. The major parties wanted their candidates to exclude whoever they want and to choose any panelists they want. \n\n \n Despite the presence of Ross Perot in 1992, they also say...\n \nThe CPD became lone presidential debate sponsor and conducted the 1988 debates on exactly the same terms that the League deemed fraudulent. Ever since, challenging formats and popular candidates have been excluded from the presidential debates.\n\n \n Should the presidential debates be organized by a group controlled by the two major parties? Should the CPD receive corporate funding? \n \n According to \"Open Debates\" the seven major problems associated with the CPD are:\n 1.The CPD was created by the major parties to strengthen the major parties.\n 2.The CPD is primarily financed by multinational corporations.\n 3.The CPD awards the candidates absolute control over the debate process.\n 4.The CPD excludes popular candidates\n 5.The CPD employs uninspiring formats.\n 6.The CPD shields the major party candidates from public accountability.\n 7.The CPD violates FEC and IRS regulations.\n \n \n I think I have the biggest prblem with #3. The debates should not be a place to rehash campaign rhetoric, but a place where the public can see the cadidates thinking on their feet. What do they do with surprise questions? How do they handle bitter criticism? \n \n My next biggest problem is with #2. If anyone from a non-Republicrat party criticizes certain large corporations or even whole industries (such as pharmaceuticals or gambling) your chances of being included are sharply diminished since the CPD is run mostly by lobbyists from those industries.\n \n Anyway, I think anyone who looks at the CPD and compares that to truly open debates will see that the current system, if not corrupt, certainly hampers the democratic process.\n \n .",

   "The biggest insult to the American voter is the thirty something page book of regulations that had to be followed in order to ensure both candidates would grace us with their participation. It's like the tail wagging the dog: how about they both show up, check their arrogance at the door, and do their best to convince the voters they deserve the most prestigious job in the world!",
