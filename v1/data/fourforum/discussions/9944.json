Catholicism is merely a large family.\n \n I have chosen to be subordinate and to accept my role in the Catholic Family. It was not forced upon me, I was not brainwashed into accepting it... I wanted to accept it. \n \n The teachings of Christ is subordination to each other, of servitude to God, to christians and to mankind. \n \n Jesus said \"the truth shall set you free\"\n \n But free from what?.... free from being subordinate from the truth...no!\n \n The freedom Christ is talking about is freedom from deception....especially self deception grounded in self servitude and this freedom can only be found in subordination to him\n \n Abortion is a good one to take for example.\n \n 1. The deception/self deception\n \n Abortion is safe, its my body, A fetus is part of a womans body, Its nothimg more than a blob of tissue, A fetus is not a person, a fetus is not a human being, A fetus is not an individual.\n \n 2. The Truth\n \n A fetus is a individual human being and therefore a person (in that sense) which is a lot more than a blob of tissue and genetically it is clear that the fetus is not part of a womans body, not part of your body, Abortion is clearly unsafe for the fetus since abortion kills him or her.\n \n 3. Gods truth.\n \n all members of the human race are made in the image and likeness of God and deserving of respect and protection from those who seek them harm...the truth is a pregnant woman should not seek to harm her child.\n \n To know god is to know the truth (in this case about the nature of human being) even if god has not explicitly said in the bible not to procure abortion, but to know him is to know the truth (even if your parents had not told you not to take drugs, you would know if they would or would not approve because you know them on a deeper level than mere words) and to know the truth sets you free from the deceptions others try to decieve you with and also sets you free from your own self deceptions driven on by fear, by desire ect.\n \n we are all subordinate to someone or something even if we ourselves do not realise that we are subordinate to them. Faith is often a realisation and rebellion against subordination to certain factions and deceptions, media, culture, governments..but it also calls you to rebell against your own desires and self deceptions, you realise these are men and women simply persuing their own self interests then you realise it is only by self sacrafice that you can be an example to them, it is then you realise the power of the cross.",
