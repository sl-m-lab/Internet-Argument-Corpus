   "Not at all. I am not being hypocritical because I don't believe in 'natural rights' at all, at least as far as I understand these rights to exist.\n \n\n \n So you want to \"opress and control\" people who for whatever reason like to put thier cod piece into places you do not. I too disagre with thier lifestyle but I do not imply that these people need to be \"controlled\" and would be willing to fight an oppressive government who tried to impose any such control on ANY people. Also as I said before the governmemnt should not be in the marriage business in the first place so this whole \"gay marriage\" XXXX is just that IM \"not so humble\" O....\n \n \n \n \n\n Rights such as equality don't exist from nature, but from God. God made laws. The same God who made laws tells me that homosexuality is against the will of God.*\n \n *Furthermore, this is the God of the Christians, not the god of progress or whatever Locke, and the founding fathers believed in when they refer to a 'creator'.\n\n \n \n So what does your G-d suggest you do to these people? Actually our founding fathers were indeed talking about the same G-d you are so willing to follow. \n \n So you read the Good Book do you. Do you get your right from wrong from which version? You do know the \"King James\" version was re-written to give the king more power? The Catholic version includes and omits passages and books that are contrary to Romes agenda.\n \n \n\n Thus I can't support 'the natural rights' of homosexuals, nor can I support 'the natural rights' of gun-ownership.\n \n\n \n Because your a bigot and a tyrant... What do you propose should be done with people you disagree with (shrouded in your own so called righteousness of your supposed faith)\n \n You use religion as a crutch to rationalize your bigotry. You use religion and tyrannical governmental intrusion to save you from your criminal mind. (see my reply in the NRA thread in the general section)..\n \n \n\n If you want to own guns, based on 'written or traditional law' rather than 'natural law' (which you've still not bothered to define), then we can move on. Otherwise you'll either need to define 'natural laws' as you understand them, or cease debating me... for we'll be talking past each other.\n \n\n \n I have defined it now over and over again. Here is another definition from a libertarian site since you just do not want to get my definitions. This directly addresses your ignorance:\n \n [/b]\"Natural rights are the fundamental political concept, and are derived from the proper ethical basis (enlightened self-interest). Since man's prime value is his own life, the prime right is the right of life, and by extension self-ownership. Only by protecting life can a society ensure the free exercise and flourishing of the lives of its own citizens.\n \n All rights are derived from the right of life. With the possession of one's body comes the right of one's actions. One can hardly be said to own his life if he is not free to act as he sees fit. The same thing applies to the result of these actions, which is property. All individual rights can be subsumed to the rights of self-ownership, action and property.\n \n \n Natural rights are natural because they are derived from objective deductions and observations, and therefore give us an optimal pattern of government to follow. In practice, this means that a government's functions should be limited to protecting the natural rights of its citizens, instead of using them for its own benefit. Such a government would be completely libertarian.\n \n An objection to the notion of natural rights is that they are not materially obvious - for example, governments break them regularily. How could they exist ? But rights are not material entities. They are indications of the pattern of laws which is optimal for a human society. The same thing could be said of a standard. Even if some manufacturers don't follow a given standard, this does not make that standard any less desirable\"[/b]\n \n \n \n\n It's good of you to respond to one of my posts more directly. There were no jingoes there, just a straight-forward question. What you need to do is look at posts such as those of DMG and see that on one hand he's supporting less government interference in personal choice with respect to guns, but not so with respect to gay marriages. This is the typical response I expected when I started the thread re: NRA and gay rights - many pro-gunners are anti-gay, despite your good self, and a pink-guns web-site.\n \n I look forward to you equally engaging him, unless you feel he is not being hypocritical, or you just like debating me\n\n \n Sorry if I do not take a compliment from a religeous zealoted bigot. If I were truly interested in the \"gay\" issue I would comment on it but I am really not interested.. I will say this.. The difference between you and him is that he advocates freedom and only comments on his views of gays not regulation by government which you and your G-d seem to be advocating\n \n \nI don't see this happening though. You seem silent on the issue of people who support only natural laws when it supports themselves, perhaps because you treat 'natural laws' with the same respect.\n\n \n \n I am not debating gay rights... I am debating gun control, natural rights of ALL individuals, and your bigotry currently. Even so I have not remained silent on these issues. You just choose what to see and claim that things are not addressed when you have no argument against them.\n \n \n You know I am an ordained minister. I perform marriages, give sermons, consel people, and do hospice work. I also believe that people like you are the least G-d like because of your Idolotry of these tyrannical federal governments and your bigotry of your fellow man. Your wickedness is using your belief in a greater power as a crutch for your irrational views on your brethren. You should reflect upon this.

We are all children of G-d. Bhuddist, Muslim, pagan, Christian, etc... This very image of heaven we have in ourselves. The very being of G-d is withing us. Is there anything more precious and more worhty of defense than that? Why do Bhuddist monks train in martial arts. Why is there a martial art called Aikido which teaches a non violent (albiet ineffective in its current form IMHO) solution to aggression. The Jews in Germany tried it non-violence (warsaw ghetto excepted) and all that got them was a free train ride and a gas shower. \n \n \n I own and shoot guns because of the value I put on life. I am willing to defend through mortal combat, myself, my family, my country, even you if needed and do so with a clear conscious of inner peace knowing that right actions, right thoughts are my guide. Because I am on equal footing in capabilities with those who would cause harm. I can truly fight for the peace and liberty we as the human kind hold so dear.\n \n \n \n \n I leave you with the wise words of the ages:\n \n \"A pacifist is not really a pacifist if he is unable to make a choice between violence and non-violence. A true pacifist is able to kill or maim in the blink of an eye, but at the moment of impending destruction of the enemy he chooses non-violence. He chooses peace. He must be able to make a choice. He must have the genuine ability to destroy his enemy and then choose not to.\" -Takamura\n \n \"I believe in the sun even though it is slow in rising. I believe in you without realizing. I believe in rain though there are no clouds in the sky. I believe in truth even though people lie. I believe in peace though sometimes I am violent. I believe in God even though he is silent.\"\n --Unknown \n \n \"Peace is not the absence of war; it is a virtue; a state of mind; a disposition for benevolence; confidence; and justice.\" \n --Spinoza \n \n \"Peace, in the sense of absence of war, is of little value to someone who is dying of hunger or cold.

But then you're incapable of knowing friend from foe or recognising any debt.\n \n So, you say no Russians fought Germans on US soil... May I then ask how many USA troops went to the Soviet Union to save Russians? Does your illogic even trigger a single brain cell of recognition in you?\n \n There exists a small spark of recognition when you raise the issue of 'lend lease'. This shows that the USA contributed material support to the Soviets. They did not need to fight on Russian soil, but still provided help. Likewise the Soviets didn't need to fight on British soil to help Britain, or US soil to help Americans. The Soviets, by tying down more German forces than any other nation helped the USA and Britain. Can that small fact at least pass through the massive thickness of your skull?\n \n I have thanked you. I don't mind doing so. Give credit where credit is due is what I ask of you. What buffoonery will you come up with this time (or rather again)?\n \n By the way, where is \"Tokoyo\"?",

   "You're a buffoon. Once again, I will give credit where credit is due. Only you will not.\n \n I have said that the USA has contributed more, your previous post even has a quote of me doing just that.\n \n Only you're so narrow minded as not to thank the Chinese, Russians and anyone else who helped win the war.\n \n Thank God for John Wayne huh?\n \n Why do you think constantly asking me to do something I've already done counts as an argument?\n \n Here again: The USA contributed greatly to the allied war effort.\n \n However, the Soviets contributed more. Australia less.\n \n You demean the others, as Hellhound has, by referring to their courageous efforts as 'bullet sponges'.\n \n Why don't you have the guts or the honesty to make a frank admission that the Soviets, and the Chinese contributed more? I know you don't want to lay your red-neck on the line, but constantly daring me to acknowledge US efforts is an indication that you either don't understand when I reply, or you are in some kind of automatic knee-jerk mode that you can't escape from; giving the same reactions regardless of what I post.\n \n The closest you've come is this Which\n a) is a phrase waiting for the rest of a sentence\n b) is full of spelling errors \n and more importantly;\n c) does not acknowledge that the Soviets contributed MORE than the USA.\n \n This is the most timid of admissions, because immediately after this you qualify this greatly when you say that the USA wasn't 'saved' by anyone.\n \n Your whole post was...\n \n \n \n Firstly, you insult your greatest ally, Hellhound.

Now you're trying to show respect, gone are the flippant remarks.\n \n You're the one who brought up the argument of comparison of relative efforts of different participants by suggesting that the USA contributed more to saving Australia's arse than Australia; that we should thank you for this effort. You were comparing different efforts, now you're not.\n \n I know it's so very hard for you to admit that the Soviets 'saved your arse'. It must really grate on you that you're now double-taking and flipping 180 degrees!\n \n But to get to your exact statement; therefore the Soviet war widow; was her loss 'enough'? You who won't even admit to the Russian sacrifices? You who suggested that you owed them nothing at all because no Russian had fought on US soil against the Germans!
