   "What does this drivel have to do with creation/evolution? Did it cross your mind to post it somewhere appropriate?\n \nHuman beings are naturally chaotic and posses a strong sense of \"evil\", so how do we stop self destruction?\n\n What utter nonsense. What a depressing, self destructive attitude. In fact, that attitude is pretty destructive of others too.\n \nThe Bible. The bible was created for control, without the bible, without the promise of being rewarded for your kindness and brotherhood on earth, humans would have no reason to surpress their natural tendencies.\n\n And that is why Bible thumpers are so dangerous. The have so little self respect and so little respect for others that they need the thread of eternal punishment to keep them in check. Thank God for the Bible to frighten you into honorable behavior.\n \nIf there was no bible and no promise of an after life why would a slave want to endure such a horrible life?\n\n You're kidding, right? Why would a slave want to be a slave anyway? Your words imply that slavery is justified - a Biblical institution. You imply that it is right for one person to enslave another. I on the other hand, believe that a slave is justified in killing in an effort to escape slavery. Kind of like, \"When in the course of human events it becomes justified for one people to disolve the political bonds...\"\n \nHe wouldn't, he would kill himself or his master, but no, If he does good on earth and believes in the \"lord\" he will be rewarded. CONTROL.\n\n Except he doesn't have the right to control himself, according to your sick morality. What if you were a slave? How would you feel about it then? Still OK? Do you still need to control yourself and be happy in your horrible life because some book of mythology promises you happiness when you finally die from bad treatment, poor food, or being worked to death?\n \nIn the book the Lord of the Flies the young boys are stranded by themselves with no adults, they start off normal, as if there were adults still present. But, as time goes on, the lack of an authoritve figure begins to change their mental state. They become what humans naturally are, primal and sinister. The point is that without adults the children changed, became evil, so just as the children need control, who controls the adults? God.\n\n The point is that the book is fiction, just like most of you Bible. Actually, what is implicit in the word adult is the ability to act rationally. But it doesn't always work. That is why such a high percentage of the prison population of our country is fundamentalist christian.\n \nThe bible is nothing more than a book of morals meant to give those who have nothing to live for a reason to live.\n\n And those who respect themselves and others don't need that book of morality.\n \nWhy spend your life thanking someone for creating you, created you to worship him, when you can just live.\n\n Show me that someone.\n \nWho cares who or what we came from, live in the present, think about the future.\n\n Exactly. I live in the present so that in the future I will still respect myself and my co-workers will respect me, and my neighbors will respect me. I don't lie, cheat or steal. What I have, I have earned. I served my country, as did both of my brothers, one of my nephews and one of my sons. Another son is an officer of the court.\n \n You're a danger. Some day your little book won't seem to hold so much promise for you and then you will strike out at others since you seem to lack the self respect and honor to take responsibility for yourself.",

   "Yes, AgileDevil, I have to agree that your initial post was a bit confusing. I, myself, couldn't tell which side you were taking.\n \n I would suggest that you use the \"preview\" button before you submit a post - that will give you a chance to read you post before you submit it for real - check for typos, grammar, clarity, and the like. It will also give you chance to see whether any included links or pictures are being posted correctly, too.\n \n Another suggestion is to write your post using your favorite text editor, and then cut'n'paste into the post window when it is ready. The advantages are that you can put it away and then reread and edit before actually posting; also, your work isn't lost if the system \"hiccups\". I especially recommend this for long posts.\n \n The tone of your initial post also sounded a bit abusive. Although not necessarily wrong (there are several people here who use that as their main posting style), it does have a tendency of starting nasty name-calling arguments as opposed to initiating rational debate.\n \n Anyway, welcome to 4forums.",
