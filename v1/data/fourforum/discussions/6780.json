   "Since I have to write a report on this...\n \n Do you think state taxes should be an allowable deduction for federal tax purposes?\n \n \nThe Panel recommends eliminating the itemized deduction for state and local taxes. This deduction provides a federal tax subsidy for public services provided by state and local governments. Taxpayers who claim the state and local tax deduction pay for these services with tax-free dollars. These services, which are determined through the political process, represent a substantial personal benefit to the state or local residents who receive them - either by delivering the service directly or by supporting a better quality of life in their community. The Panel concluded that these expenditures should be treated like any other nondeductible personal expense, such as food or clothing, and that the cost of those services should be borne by those who want them - not by every taxpayer in the country.\n The state and local tax deduction forces residents of low-tax jurisdictions to subsidize government services received by taxpayers in high-tax jurisdictions. As with many other tax benefits, the state and local tax deduction requires higher tax rates for everyone, but the benefits of the deduction are not shared equally among taxpayers. The deduction is limited to itemizers, and households with higher income and tax rates receive a greater share of the benefit from the deduction. Even among itemizers, the benefits of the deduction are not shared evenly, as the AMT is increasingly erasing the benefit of the state and local tax deduction for many middle-class taxpayers. Depending on the year, between 64 and 70 percent of taxpayers with adjusted gross income over $100,000 who would no longer receive a deduction for state and local taxes also would have paid higher taxes under the AMT, which is repealed under the Panel's options.\n\n http://taxreformpanel.gov/final-report/TaxPanel_2_11-1.pdf\n pages 83-84",
