   "Homosexuality at Calvin: Panel transforms student mindset \n \n \nThree Calvin students and one Calvin alumnus shared their personal struggles with homosexuality at a panel discussion on Tuesday, March 7.\n \n Commons Lecture Hall was packed with about 200 students, alumni, professors, and supportive parents and friends of the panelists, all hoping to learn more about this sensitive issue.\n \n The purpose of the discussion was to \"help the student body to understand issues of sexuality and orientation\" as well as to \"help people understand there are things they can do if they are in this situation,\" said Audrey Kelly, co-chair of the Broene Educational Team.\n \n The Broene Educational Team is a new group on campus that developed from The Broene Educational Team Support group for gays, lesbians, bisexuals. For the past 10 years that group has met once a week with advisor Dan Vandersteen to \"make connections with people who understand and are going through the same things\" said Kelly.\n \n The new Educational Team is concerned with \"working to educate the Calvin community about issues concerning gender and sexual orientation, within a Christian framework,\" said one of the Team's publications. \n \n The group is \"open to any compassionate individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, who are interested in promoting understanding in the Calvin community.\"\n \n Tuesday night's panel discussion was the first in a series of such educational events. Professor Christiana DeGroot hosted the event, clarifying that the discussion was not the place for political or theological debate, but simply an opportunity to listen to the panelist's personal experiences and struggles with homosexuality in order to promote better understanding on Calvin's campus.\n \n While each panelist had a unique story to share, some themes resonated throughout all of the speeches. For instance, most panelists mentioned a specific time when they realized they were different from their peers.\n \n Sara*, currently a senior at Calvin, first noticed a difference when she was a sophomore in high school. While her friends were getting interested in guys she just didn't have the same feelings. \"I played along with their interaction with guys\" she said.\n \n Dave* noticed a difference at a much younger age. \"Things were funny in 3rd and 4th grade. At recess I noticed I'd rather make bracelets with the girls than play with the boys.\"\n \n Eric* had a slightly different experience. In middle school \"people were already making fun of me about this. I've always had this idea of being gay pushed at me,\" he said. \n \n Subsequently, all of the panelists described their attempts to \"not be gay.\"\n \n While Sara was in high school, she tried to date guys but ended up getting a crush on one of her girl friends. She remembers thinking, \"I'm a Christian, that's not possible, I can't be gay. This is not a possibility for me.\"\n \n When Sara came to Calvin, she hoped for a fresh start. \"I'm moving away from the problem, I'll leave that at home,\" recalled Sara. Again, she dated guys for a while.\n \n \"The whole time I'd be praying. It became a spiritual struggle for me. 'Please God make this work, meet me halfway on this; I'm really trying here, You should reward my efforts.'\"\n \n She described a specific transition point when she was in a very close emotional relationship with one guy. \"I guess I couldn't kiss him honestly. [The breakup] was really hard on both of us,\" said Sara. That's when she decided to stop dating guys. \"It was a big relief because I realized 'I don't have to keep going against who I am.'\" \n \n Jack*, the one alumnus on the panel commented, \"Living in the closet takes its toll.\" He referred to numerous contemporaries who \"tried to lead normal lives.\" One of those people had extraneous homosexual relations, contracted HIV and became an alcoholic. \n \n Jeff also tried to deny his attraction to the same sex. \"I figured it'd pass,\" he said in reference to liking guys in high school. \n \n Jeff and the other panelists all endured periods of self hate because of their sexuality. \"At times I'd burn myself,\" Jeff said. After doing some research later on, Jeff said, \"It shocked me how many homosexual men cut and burn.\" They're almost six times more likely to do so. Jeff added that \"one third of young men who commit suicide are homosexual.\" \n \n Eric mentioned that he's been \"struggling with depression since age 14.\" Sara also mentioned feeling depressed during high school.\n \n All of the panelists struggled with feeling isolated from their communities, both in high school and at Calvin. Jeff commented that he \"kept very much to myself\" during high school. At Calvin, when Sara was struggling to admit to herself that she was gay, her friends noticed that something was wrong. \"I couldn't tell them what it was. I didn't want to tell them what it was. I couldn't believe that they could still love me if they knew,\" she said. Eric commented \"Building community at Calvin has been difficult. I was not comfortable at all living in the dorms for two years.\"\n \n Jack referred to his gay and lesbian friends who feel \"spiritual but not religious.\" They still feel a connection with God but don't want to label themselves as Christian.\n \n Heidi DeYoung, an ordained minister in the Christian Reformed Church represented the church's official stance on the matter. \"I firmly believe that as the Christian Reformed Church, we aren't living up to the Christian Reformed position on homosexuality,\" she said. The church's official position is that \"No person should be denied community because of their sexual orientation.\" \n \n \"Part of my mission is to be an educator and to live out the position as a church that we're not living up to now,\" said DeYoung.\n \n While all of the panelists have experienced similar struggles, they are all at different places on the path towards self acceptance.\n \n Eric states that \"it's been a seven year struggle,\" in reference to his depression. \"But I have a lot of support in my life. I'm not sure what I'm doing with the rest of my life yet, but that's where I am now and I'm just praying I'll end up where God wants me to be.\"\n \n \"How do you think God would want me to live?\" asked Jack rhetorically, \"honestly, openly, living a committed life with my partner, or living a lie, denying who I am?\"\n \n Sara has prayed a lot about her struggle. \"My spirituality has been important to me, maybe even more because I'm gay. I'm now to a point where I think God accepts me.\" As far as her future is concerned, \"It's the classic marriage thing. If I think the other person and I could be more beneficial to God's kingdom than us alone then I will do that. I don't think that's sinful. I've witnessed a lot of God's peace and power throughout all this and I'm excited to see where he takes me, gay or straight.\"\n \n Jeff still struggles with feeling accepted. \"I wish that I wasn't gay. I don't feel comfortable in my own skin,\" said Jeff. \"I plead with God asking him to let me in on the secret. Why'd you put me here and why'd you make me this way?\" Jeff has had to deal with coming out to his dad and his home community in the last few months. But he has made some important realizations. \"I answer to God alone. Not to the church, not to Calvin, or to my dad, or to my pastor. All things to God, all things to his name, and to him be the glory forever.\"\n http://www-stu.calvin.edu/chimes/article.php?volume=100&issue=21&id=1638\n \n Frankly, I think the testimony of these people knocks about 90% of the cockamamie assertions we get from the anti-gay posters (and faux \"pro-gay\" posters) on this forum into a cocked hat.",

There is a difference. \n When an African American speaks of there struggles is your first response well they are obviously \"pro-African American\"? \n No one should have to suffer, you are absolutely right on that point. Do you thnk the conservative christion right is doing there part to minimize these youths suffering? \n IMO I think they are adding to the suffering and ultimately the rate of suicide by making them feel like outcasts and oppressing there right to live the life God gave them.

Whether or not things are as gawd-awful as some gay activists make it out to be is certainly up for debate.
