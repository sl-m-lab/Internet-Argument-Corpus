   "I think that one of the biggest arguments against ballistic fingerprinting is that you are talking about a fairly expensive proposition, with little or no payoff. To test and document millions of guns can be expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. You can chage the ballistic fingerprint of a gun by swapping out or re-honing the barrel and doing a little scraping with a file on the firng pin and extractor. \n \n So, we are spending hundreds of millions on a system that a criminal can bypass in about 20 minutes and by spending about $30. I think we can class that in with the whole background check farce, millions spent with nothing to show for it.\n \n There is a new idea out there to microscopically stamp each shell casing with the serial number of the gun as the bullet is ejected. This would be accomplished by a really tiny casting/milling inside the gun. This is a little better than the ballistic fingerprinting idea, IMHO, beacuse you would not have to spend the millions on testing and setting up databases to contain the info. Also, form the technical info I have seen, the area of the casting/millin would be very hard (most likely case hardened), so it would be more difficult to file down, say....30 minutes instead of the 20. Multiply that 10 minutes by all the criminals in america, and you are looking at a significant number of man hours that they are not out commiting crimes!",

   "Thanks, for your reply, Daewoo. I am trying to gather information about this, and I have found at least one source that seems to not entirely agree with your assesments, the Center for Gun Policy and Research, part of the Johns Hopkins school of Public Health. I am sure that some people will just call this group anti gun, and left wingers, and though I don't know what the common perception of them is, they seem to be reasoanable....I put a link to their mission statement:here\n \n I will go through some of your statements, and post relevent information provided by them:\n \n \n\n I think that one of the biggest arguments against ballistic fingerprinting is that you are talking about a fairly expensive proposition, with little or no payoff. To test and document millions of guns can be expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. \n \n\n \n I am not sure about what the cost would be, I haven't yet found any estimate, but I would imagine that your estimate is reasonable. I think that I heard somewhere the the Baltimore trial cost a couple of million dollars. Anyway...\n \n  When considering a federal ballistic fingerprint law for new gun sales, policymakers should also consider that a federal law may be more effective than state laws due to its potential for deterring interstate gun trafficking. Although a federal ballistic fingerprint law may be more effective than a patchwork of state systems, the costs of creating, maintaining, and using a federal system are likely to be substantial. The projected costs of the system must be weighed against the potential to reduce the enormous social and economic costs associated with gun violence. Eighty lives per day-almost 29,000 per year-are lost to gun violence in the United States.16 The social costs of gun violence in the United States have been estimated to be an extraordinary $100 billion per year.17 If ballistic fingerprinting laws result in significant reductions in gun violence- by strengthening law enforcement efforts to identify and prosecute violent offenders and deterring illegal gun use by and transfers to criminals and youth-the investment will be well worth it.\n \n \n Also, \n \n -In 1994, the lifetime medical costs associated with firearm injuries and deaths totaled $2.3 billion.\n - Approximately 49% of the costs of gun-related injuries and deaths is paid by the public. \n -The hospitalization costs associated with firearm-related injuries in 1997 exceeded $800 million.\n -Thirty percent (30%) of hospitalized patients were uninsured, and an additional 30% were enrolled in government health insurance programs. \n -The direct costs (e.g., medical, productivity) and social costs (e.g., quality of life, emotional) of gun violence are an estimated $100 billion per year.\n \n \n \n\n You can chage the ballistic fingerprint of a gun by swapping out or re-honing the barrel and doing a little scraping with a file on the firng pin and extractor. \n \n\n \n While it may be impossible to prevent criminals from attempting to defeat the system, the ATF reports that such efforts to date have been very rare. Analogously, few criminals wear gloves in order to avoid leaving their fingerprints at a crime scene, and very few guns used in crime have obliterated serial numbers to prevent gun tracing. Nevertheless, comprehensive ballistic fingerprint policies are likely to prompt some criminals to attempt to alter their guns' ballistic fingerprints, and this could reduce the effectiveness of these systems. Some alterations may not prevent the system and ballistics experts from making a valid match in the database. Furthermore, a range of strategies could be considered to deter ballistic fingerprint alteration. Just as possession of a gun with an obliterated serial number is a federal crime, possession of a gun that has been altered to change its ballistic fingerprint, without proper notification of the police, could be made a separate crime with significant penalties. Inventive engineers may also be able to design guns in ways that make it more difficult to change\n ballistic fingerprints.\n \n \n\n So, we are spending hundreds of millions on a system that a criminal can bypass in about 20 minutes and by spending about $30. I think we can class that in with the whole background check farce, millions spent with nothing to show for it.\n \n\n \n \n Brady Law: A 2000 study found that the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1994 had no significant effect on homicide rates, but appeared to be associated with a reduction in gun suicides among persons 55 years and older, particularly in states that required both background checks and waiting periods. The authors suggest that the lack of effect on homicides may be due to the Brady Law's failure to require background checks for guns bought from non-dealers (so-called \"secondary sales\").\n \n Criminal History Purchase Restrictions: Policies that deny handgun purchases to individuals with prior misdemeanor or felony convictions are associated with a decreased risk of subsequent convictions. Misdemeanants who had been allowed to purchase handguns prior to the passage of a California state law prohibiting such purchases had a rate of criminal offending 29% higher than that among misdemeanants who were denied handgun purchases after the law took effect.\n \n Domestic Violence Purchase Restrictions: Recent research indicates that laws to restrict firearm access for batterers subject to restraining orders are associated with an 11% reduction in rates of intimate partner homicide of women. However, such laws are only effective in reducing intimate partner homicides in states that have implemented a system to screen potential firearms purchasers for restraining orders. No effect on intimate partner homicide was measured for laws that restrict firearm access for domestic violence misdemeanants.\n \n \n\n There is a new idea out there to microscopically stamp each shell casing with the serial number of the gun as the bullet is ejected. ...\n\n \n I don't know anything about this proposal, but I will look, and if you find anything interesting on it, any posts would be appreciated.\n So, it seems to me that you would not have a problem with a system of trying to somehow fingerprining a gun, as long as it was relatively cheap and effective. Is that correct?\n \n Again, thanks for your thoughts.\n \n \n ps - I do not claim responsibility for their sources. I put a link to the their studies and sources here and here",

   "If there was a cheap andeffective way to do it I think it would be worth considering. As is, altering the gun to change it's ballistic fingerprint would be simple and cheap. The problem with enacting their proposed law against altering the ballistic fingerprint is that the gun would have to be seized and tested in order to tell whether it had been altered. This brings up questions pertaining to due process.\n \n The other problem with the idea is that the ballistic fingerprint of a gun changes over time and with repeated firings. The ballistic fingerprinting theory is based on the fact that every gun barrel is SLIGHTLY unique, as is every firing pin. If you do a ballistic fingerprint on a gun, then fire it a couple hundred times, your original ballistic fingerprint is worthless. In theory, every barrel SHOULD be identical, what the ballistic fingerprint looks for is minute defects. Every time you put a round down the barrel, it changes the barrel slightly.\n \n I do quite a bit of cometitive shooting using a customised 1911. I fire about 1000 practice rounds a week, and replace my barrel about once a month because after about 4000 rounds my groups start to get sloppy. This is because each round down the barrel wears it just a bit. Jacketed rounds wear it more quickly than standards, and cheap rounds (like the reloads you can get at wal mart) wear it REALLY fast (twice as fast, at least).\n \n So, in addition to being able to quickly and easily change the ballistic fingerprint, it changes just through normal use of the gun. Granted, most people don't shoot a single gun as often as I shoot my competition piece, but I don't think that 1000-2000 rounds per year for a hobby marksman is unreasonable.\n \n I had occasion to speak with a sheriffs deputy today who is a frioend of mine. He says that to get a ballistic fingerprint from a gun, they have to send the gun off. It usually takes about a week, and it costs about $900 to have a comparison done. He also said that they have been told that it is best to get the gun if it has not been fired since the incident, and that by firng the gun merely 10 times CAN (not always) change the ballistic fingerprint enough for a match to be impossible.",

   "I once had a physicist from the DOE get on the stand, in a court of law, and testify that energy could be created, and you could get more energy out of a reaction than you put into it. This is, of course, in conflict with the laws of physics. He believed it, though, and that was his testimony.\n \n I noted that the Center for Gun Policy an Research does not cite who they spoke to at the ATF. The national ballistcs lab tells a different story (that is where the instructions our local law enforcement follows came from). \n \n I am not a gunsmith. I do have quite a bit of experience in materials engineering and frictional analysis, so I do know exactly what the effect of a brass jacketed, high velocity projectile travelling down a steel tube is, and I know that recognisable projectile deformity is dictated by the hardness of the barrel, the hardness of the projectile (which is why jacketed rounds wear the barrel faster), the temperature of the barrel and the velocity of the projectile.\n \n Even under best case scenario, using a barrel with a rockwell number of 45 (rockwell is a scale for determining how hard a material is), which is actually harder than most gun barrels, and using a brass with a high copper content (the copper content is, in large part, what determines the hardness of the brass), it would be very difficult to get repeatability beyond 500 rounds.\n \n I calculated the exact repeatability using my 1911. I measure the barrel, tested it to determine how hard it is, measured a round, tested the jacketing material. Taking into account the ambient temperature, and factoring in the projected rise in barrel temperature due to the hot gasses and friction from firing the gun (I had my thermodynamics guy do this), I calculated that I could fire 327 rounds through that particular gun and still expect some degree of constantly identifiable projectile deformity. Beyond 327 rounds, the odds of an identifiable deformity decresed quickly, to the point that at 500 rounds I can say with complete confidence that there would exist no identifiable deformity. \n \n Either they spoke with somebody at the ATF who was VERY optomistic about their abilities, or they spoke with somebody at the ATF who was a liar, or they didn't speak to anybody at the ATF at all. There are well established principals that determine things like the effects of friction between two unlike materials. This is why we do not use brass bushings around steel spindles in high speed applications.\n \n THe problem I have with reports from folks like Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in regards to things like gun control is that I fail to see their qualification. On their \"about us\" page, it says they are composed of public health professionals, researchers, and lawyers. How are they qualified to comment on things like physics or gunsmithing?\n \n I run a small business that builds prototypes and one-off production items (like parts for space craft and sats). I would not expect my doctor to come down and be able to design a mounting base for a camera, or to replace a guy running a vertical mill, and I ceratinly would hope that my doctor would have more sense than to allow me or one of my machinists to come on down to the hospital and perform a heart transplant.\n \n I think these folks heart is in the right place. They percieve a problem and they are working to try to establish a solution to the problem, I can respect that. I simply doubt their qualifications when it comes to matters like this. If a person wants information on the something related to gun design, I would reccomend they contact Heckler and Koch. They make some of the best gund in the world, and they employ HUNDREDS of people who design guns, test materials and engineer barrel systems. Alternatively, Smith and Wesson also has a large design department, and are located right here in the US. You can even get a free tour of their factory.\n \n Besides the physical considerations, there is, again, the practical considerations. Th more poular guns for criminals seem to be the Glocks and Bareetas. These are imported guns. They are popular with criminals for a reason, namely that they can be obtained \"grey market\" with relative ease. They are smuggled in from Mexico by the truckload and sold, in many cases, BELOW what you would pay for a lgal gun in a gun store.\n \n The whole ballistic fingerprint thing, IMHO, seems to be a re-run of the brady bill.

   "First off, Daewoo, I would like to thank you for your post. You make very convincing arguments, and as I think that I said, I am not here to say that fingerprinting is the answer, just to explore the possibility. You have given some very thougtful and convincing arguments against it, and again, I thank you because that is, for me at least, exactly the point of this thread.\n OK, I will commnet on a few part of what you said....\n \n \n\n \n I noted that the Center for Gun Policy an Research does not cite who they spoke to at the ATF. The national ballistcs lab tells a different story (that is where the instructions our local law enforcement follows came from). \n \n \n\n \n I am sorry if you said this before, and I didn't respond. You may be right, I wil have to check their sources on that, and I will try to dig around. What is the national ballistics lab? Do they have a web site?\n \n \n \n\n \n THe problem I have with reports from folks like Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in regards to things like gun control is that I fail to see their qualification. On their \"about us\" page, it says they are composed of public health professionals, researchers, and lawyers. How are they qualified to comment on things like physics or gunsmithing?\n \n \n\n \n A good point. However, I do think that it is acceptable not to necessarily have ballistics experts on your staff, instead to rely upon testimonials of experts, as it would be impossible to have within you staff experts on everything.\n \n \n \n\n \n \n I run a small business that builds prototypes and one-off production items (like parts for space craft and sats). \n \n \n\n \n \n Although it is off topic, I am curious about what you do, exacly, as it sounds very interesting. If you feel that it would not be appropriate in this thread, than perhaps a defferent? I think there is sort of a 'tell more about yourself' thread...\n \n \n \n\n \n Th more poular guns for criminals seem to be the Glocks and Bareetas. These are imported guns. \n ...\n They are smuggled in from Mexico by the truckload and ...\n \n \n\n \n This, of course, could potentially dramatically undermine the effectiveness of such a program. I will look for studies concerning what percentage of guns used in crimes are acquired in such a manner. If you have any links, please post.\n Again, thanks for your post. You have provided a lot of convincing evidence, and have given me enough tasks to keep me busy, and the debate interesting....",

   "I believe the nataional balistics lab is run by the FBI. I am having my deputy buddy check on this. I usually order in lunch for whoever is around the office at lunchtime, and he is pretty good about showing up about noon for a free lunch. It is nice to have some work for him to do, god knows I have fed him enough emoticon_xgood . \n \n I don't have any statistics for grey market guns. I think they are a little hard to come by, and most of them are estimates. This is because a lot of them do eventually end up \"in the system\", thus legetimising them. I bought a grey market gun a while back for my wife. I had my uddy run the number on it to make sure it wasn't hot. It is now in the system. Grey market guns are very difficult to track, mostly because the systm we use has become a bueracratic nightmare and doesn't work. I was discussing machine guns with a lawyer the other day and he showed me a memo from the DOJ. It states that the ATF's recordkeeping on the subject of NFA firearms (machine guns, short barrelled rifles, etc...) is in such poor shape that they don't have proper paperwork for HALF of the legally registered machine guns out there. \n \n This is a big deal because in order to prosecute somebody for illegal posession of a machine gun, they first have to prove that the person did not, or does not have a permit to posess that firearm. Either somebody from the record division of the ATF has to come and testify at the trial, or send a sworn affidavid that states that there is no record of that person having a licence, or that there is no record of that particular machine gun being registered. It kind of shoots the \"illegal posession\" case to shreds if they can't find half of their records.\n \n These are the same folks who would likely be keeping track of the ballistic fingerprinting data......ugh.\n \n As far as my work goes, I am pretty much just a professional nerd. I started out several years ago building robotics parts for myself. Then I started making them for other guys. Then I bought better equipment, then more, even BETTER equipment.\n \n Basically, what we do is build prtotypes and proof of concept devices. Mostly it is for smaller companies (most really big companies have their own departments who do this). We have a full line of precisio metal working machines, electronic production facilities, a small foundry (can do castings in about any material up to about a ton), and a pretty good assortment of rapid prototyping machines (like big printers that print in 3D plastic). We also do a pretty good business in custom robotics.\n \n In addition, we have a fair to decent design department to assist our customers who have a good concept but lack the technical expertice to make their concept a reality. An example (and it is a personal one, I wouldn't betray somebody elses confidence):\n \n I wanted an incubator (for bird eggs) that was computer controlled. I wanted to be able to connect it to a PC via a USB port or a network cable and control temp, humidity, and egg turning all from the PC. I also wanted a variety of sensors installed do I could pull up a report with graphs showing any temperature fluctuations, etc... I tunred the problem over to my design department (I am most actively involved int he design side, I hired a guy to run the production sie). We designed the incubator, the control circuitry, the mechanical components and the interfaces. The software guys wrote a control program with all the specs I wanted. Once the design was done, we turned it over to construction and they built it.\n \n Large comapnies with their own prototyping departments have no problem knocking out prototypes. For small companies it is often much more difficult. On of my clients was explaining what a pain it was to me one day. He said \"we used to send out circuit board patterns to one place to be etched, then they were shipped somewhere else for assembly. While that was being done, we would have a machine shop doing our metal work, and another place doing the plastics. Once it was all done, they would ship the parts back and we would assemble it in house. If there was a minor desing flaw, we might have to wait a week or more to have parts modified.\"\n \n Using our service, everything is done right there in shop, and you are paying one prift margin as opposed to paying overhead to 6 different shops. Also, by having our design team preview the design before we ever even start, our \"oops\" factor is greatly decreased. 97% of what we do runs right off the floor, complete and unflawed the first time. That is pretty good, consdering we find errors in roughly 40% of the designs that are sent to us.\n \n Most of the work we have done as far as sat parts and spacecraft components has been last minute stuff. I have no problem with getting a phone call at 3:00 AM and calling and waking up the whole company to come into work on a time sensitive order. I have done this more than a few times. I think it really ticks off some of the bigger companies (like Boeing), but we can usually turn out the same part in half the time and at half the cost.\n \n Basically, I turned my hobby (bulding weird stuff) into a business.",

   "You might look into how many people were denied gun purchases by the brady bill, then look at how many of them ultimatly ended up getting the go ahead. Less than 1% who were initially denied actually ended up not being able to purchase a weapon. The rest were either errors in paperwork (21%) or errors in the system (78%). I am part of the umpteen million who were \"prevented\" from purchasig a weapon by the brady background checks. Nobody was ever actually able to tell me WHY my application was denied. I filled it out again and it went through just fine. \n \n Reading an article the other day, I saw a deal about tax fraud. Apparently there is a problem with people filing false returns. They invent a social security number, use an valid EID number, and show income and an overpayment of their taxes ont he return, so they get a refund for a job they never had. The IRS not only has access to social security records, but also to the records that are submitted by the company, as well as the beiung able to cross refrence the filings with past tax returns for a given SS #. People still get away with it, because the SS administrations records are incomplete, as are the records of the IRS. Apparently the record of these 2 agencies are such a mess that it is not unusual for a SS # to pop up for a 30 yr old that has never been seen before (whihc means they have just lost the records....no big deal). \n \n I have a DOD security clearance. Th FBI has fingerprinted me 3 times in the past. This year, they had to do it again, becuase they lost my prints, not just in the computer but also the physical card. I also had to come up with 3 differnt forms of ID, becuase they couldn't find a a picture (whihc they update at least once a year). \n \n You will note that usually when immigration figures are noted, they are esimated. That is because there is no government agency who actually knows how many immigrants we have here. 3 of the terrorists from sept 11 used their real names on their visas, AND are on interpolls terrorist watch list because they were KNOWN terrorists. Interpol will send their watch list to anybody who requests it. I believe it is even available at their web page. 2 of the terrorists, they had to have paper copies of their visas located because even though the visas were over a year old, they had not yet made it into the system.\n \n If they did institute a ballistics fingerprinting system (which at this point the laws of physics and thermodynamics say is impossible), I would most like change out barrels and strikers on any gun I purchased because I would certainly not trust anybody as disorganised as the US government to keep records straight.\n \n Sadly, this is simply the state of our government. We work on government projects sometimes at work, and on a few occasions, I have double billed them by mistake. They never catch it. Once, I put the same bill through FOUR times, and they paid it every time. They never figure it out. I always have called if there was a problem and refunded the overbilling (becuase while they can't be bothered to look into it, I am certain that if they caught you you would go to jail). Unfortunatly, I do not think that a lot of folks who pick up government contracts are are worried about being fair as I am. \n \n It shocked the heck out f me that halburton got caught for overbilling. The only thing I can figure is that was such a high profile, controversial deal that there were watchdog groups drooling over the chance to bust them.",

This logic punishes just the criminals and not the law-abiding citizens!\n\n \n \n I would agree that there is a problem with violence in our country. I would agree that accidental gun deaths are something of a problem. I would disagree entirely with how some people feel that we need to solve the problem.\n \n I think that violence in our country can best be solved through treating the root causes of violence. If some junky goes out and kills a convenience store clerk during a holdup because he needs a fix, the drugs and the junky are the cause fo the crime, not the gun. Trying to stem gun violence by limiting guns is a misguided concept. Even if we did ban guns, it would be like giving asprin for cancer.\n \n As far as accidental deaths, the only answer I can see for that one is education. By the time I was 6 yrs old, I knew how to handle a gun. I knew how to check to see if it was loaded (or to load it), I knew how to fire it, I knew you never pointed it at somebody, and that you never fired unless you were absolutly sure of your target as well as what was behind it. Guns were not some kind of taboo subject. \n \n I feel it is the responsibility of parents to teach their kids the proper use of a gun if they are going to have a gun in the house. Right now, I am very careful to keep my guns locked in a gun safe. I don't have them out unless I am either walking out the door with it or cleaning them. This is because I have a 1 1/2 yr old daughter, and while she is able to tell you what sound an impressive variety of animals make, and pick out the blue circle in her color book every time, I don't think she quite grasps the rules for safe handling of a firearm. I also doubt that, even if she did understand their proper use, she would understand how to check for a clear chamber in a rifle, shotgun or pistol.\n \n When she gets older, she WILL learn the proper use and handling of firearms. IU will still keep the guns locked up, the difference will be that she will know where the key to the gunsafe is. \n \n There is nothing the governemtn can do to ensure safe handling of guns. That is an individual responsibility. Unfortunatly we have learned that some individuals are les responsible than others.\n \n I also don't think there is much the governement can do to ensure the decline in gun violenct, except to try to treat the root causes of violence. There is no law that can be made that has not already been made that will solve the problem. \n \n On place I would disagree with a lot of the pro-gunners is that stricter penalties are needed for law breakers. I think that rehab has proven itself over jailtime for drug offenders. I also think that rehabilitation through job training and educational opportunities have proven themselves over longer prison sentences. I think we need a program, instituted at a county level, where people can go down and spend a weekend in jail just to see what iut is like. I have spent a weekend in jail (didn't pay a traffic ticket, warrant sworn out...just out of school and had no money to bond out), and I can say without reservation that if I commited a crime that could result in spending 10 yrs behind bars, I would rather kill or die than spend the time in jail. \n \n I find it interesting that a prisoner in a federal prison has access to job training, and education programs. On the street, though, these programs are a lot harder to find and a lot harder to get into. They need more of these programs available at street level. I think a lot of crimes ar commited out of desperation. It is easy for me to look with destain at somebody who has robbed a bank and killed 2 cops in the process. If my family was hungry and headed towards homeless, I cannot gaurantee I would not do the same thing.\n \n One of the mill operators at my work is an ex-felon. He learned his trade behind bars. They teach a clkass in g-code programming at the local technical school, but the program is expensive and difficult to get into.\n \n I think the best way to combat crime and violence in the US is to take some of the money we use on prisons, and some of the money we use on dead end welfare programs, and put it into job training and education programs. If we turned \"Every American has a chance to go to school\" into more than just a political catch phrase, I think we would significantly reduce crime on all levels.",
