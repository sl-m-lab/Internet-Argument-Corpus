   "people think that it is when we die that we go to these places, but we are citizens of heaven or hell whilst on earth, Heaven can be experienced on earth as can hell.\n \n Hell is only existance without God and Heaven an existance with God\n \n So you can clearly experiance heaven or hell.\n \n As I have experience both, hell is not what it is cracked upto be, full of empty promises and ellaborate lies. Heaven is much more simple but seems so hard because one must sacrafice the empty promises and ellaborate lies of hell which are so tempting.\n \n there are people who are obviously in hell all around us, people often tell us that their life is a living hell, then there are those who are not so obviously in hell and those who dont even know that they are in hell.",
