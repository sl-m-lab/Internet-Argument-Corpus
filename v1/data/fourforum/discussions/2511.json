   "No, there are 21 probate records listed there. While it is true that JUST his lies concerning the probate records was enough to get him investigated and forced to resign (with an apology I might add), it was not even close to the bulk of the reasons he has been proven a fraud.\n \n You might take a look at www.claytoncramer.com. It is an interesting look from another anti-gunner (but pro constitutionalist oddly enough) where specific instances of Belleiles academic fraud are examined. As far as \"was he unfairly accused\", even he has quite beating that drum. Once your entire book is thouroghly debunked, to the point that your critics can show fraud on EVERY page, usually you stop fighting.\n \n A couple of his easily proven and debunked frauds:\n \n He discusses the Militia act of 1792. Here is how he quotes the act:\n \n Further, \"every citizen so enrolled, shall...be constantly provided with a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints,\" and other accoutrements. Congress took upon itself the responsibility of providing those guns, and specified that within five years all muskets \"shall be of bores sufficient for balls of the eighteenth part of a pound.\"\n \n He points out that it says \"be constantly provided\" in an effort to prove that individual arms were not required, the government provided them all. The only problem with this is that the Militia act of 1792 REALLY says:\n \n \"That every citizen so enrolled and notified, shall within six months thereafter, provide himself with  a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch with a box therein to contain not less than twenty-four cartridges, suited to the bore\n of his musket or firelock: or with a good rifle, knapsack, shot-pouch and powder-horn, twenty balls suited to the bore of his rifle, and a quarter of a pound of powder.\"\n \n This is just stupid. While I can almost understand lying about information that may be difficult to come by using sources that are difficult to obtain, intentionally mis-quoting federal law, which is available for anybody to read, in order to attempt to make it say the exact opposite of what is meant, is absolutly fraud. \n \n Another example of his fraud can be found in his quotation of a letter from George Washington where he claims that Washington says:\n \n &#8220;Many of them [are] unarmed, and all without ammunition or provision.&#8221; In one company of more than seventy men, he reported, only twenty-five had any sort of firearms. Washington found such militia &#8220;incapacitated to defend themselves, much less to annoy the enemy.&#8221;\n \n This is waht Washinton really had to say about that (written by his own hand):\n \n \"I think myself under the necessity of informing your Honor, of the odd behaviour of the few Militia that were marched hither from Fairfax, Culpeper, and Prince William counties. Many of them unarmed, and all without ammunition or provision. Those of Culpeper behaved particularly ill: Out of the hundred that were draughted, seventy-odd arrived here; of which only twenty-five were tolerably armed.\"\n \n You will note that he found it \"odd behaviour\" that these men would show up without weapons, and that the men from Culpepers behavior was \"particularly ill\", in that only 25 of them were tolerably armed. \n \n Bellesiles also claimed to have read over 80 person travel accounts and claimed that they supported his views. On in particular was that of Charles Augustus Murray. now, this is one I happen to have in my personal collection, and to read that and come to the conclusion that Bellasiles has is idiotic. He calimed that the majority of hunting done in early America was done by market hunters, and Murrays travel account is one which he claims proves his case.\n \n A quote from Murrays account:\n \n I lodged the first night at the house of a farmer, about seven miles from the village, who joined the habits of a hunter to those of an agriculturalist, as is indeed the case with all the country people in this district; nearly every man has a rifle, and spends part of his time in the chase. My double rifle, of London manufacture, excited much surprise among them; but the concluding remark of almost every inspector was, &#8220;I guess I could beat you to a mark.&#8221;\n \n There are hundreds of like statements throughout the book. On several occaasions, Murray expresses his facinaton with the fact that there were VERY FEW market hunters, and that most Americans hunted for themselves.\n \n These are just a few of the instances of fraud in Bellesiles work. \n \n Lott, on the other hand, apparently lost a single footnot about how often guns just had to be brandishged in order to scare off an attacker. His other research has not been brought into question.\n \n The portion that WAS brought into question was removed from the research (yep, that single sentence was deleted). It was not at all pivitol to the research, it was just a sidebar he found interesting. \n \n With lott, the question was \"can you prove this one sentence\". with Bellesiles, the question was \"can you show me a single page in this book that does not contain an instance of academic fraud?\"\n \n With lott, the figure apparently came from a phone poll he conducted himself, which he claims was lost in a hard drive crash. There have been people who came forward that remember taking the poll. Without actual tables of results, he has withdrawn the ascertation.\n \n In Ballesiles case, his missing date was show to have been lost over 100 years before he was born, and he has refused to withdraw his claims. \n \n You really don't see the difference between these guys?",

Kleck was defending his work that suggested that legal gun use cancels out illegal gun use. \n \n Second of all, Kleck later retracted/corrected the statement. While it is true that a relatively small number of people actually got concealed carry permits, it is accepted by the academic community that by using VERY county in the country as his base data set Lott effectively canceled out the \"other factors\" that Kleck refers to here. \n \n \nBecause of Kleck's criticisms, Lott has attacked Kleck anonymously several times.

Even he admits that this is entirely specultaion.\n \n While it is interesting reading what an unpublished Australian academic has to say in his crusade against American guns, I personally prefer to get information from sources who tend to be more knowledgable on the subject. I think Academics should stick to their field. In lamberts case, that is computer graphics and computational geometry.\n \n I do find some of the information in that link a little disturbing, such as that he tries to make a corrolation between the times that lott posted certian messages and the times that others posted messages. This seems like an unhealthy obsession. It appears that Lott has his own internet stalker. how cute.\n \n \nLott also lied when he claimed that the Washington DC has a higher murder rate than Baghdad.\n http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/cgi-bin/blog/guns/Lott/baghdad/\n\n \n Another blog by Lambert who, despite a complete lack of qualifications has taken it on himself to be Lotts main critic. This is just a tif over whose numbers are better. Lott argues that his are correct since he obtained them from the pentagon (specifically the 1st infatry division). These are the folks who are responsible for keeping these numbers right now, since most of the IRaqi legal system is being run by JAG officers. \n \n The other numbers come from \"data from the Baghdad morgue, a wide array of news accounts and our conversations with American officials in Washington and Iraq\".\n \n Personally, I don't care enough abotu murder rates in baghdad to do any real research into this. I have been told (by a JAG officer) that the difference is that the baghdad city morgue include all people killed by another as \"murders\", and JAG only counts those not killed as the result of militant activities as \"murders\" for statistical purposes (people killed by car bombs don't count, nor do those killed by coalition troops or guerilla attacks).\n \n If the Baghdad city morgue does include these types of killing, that would more than explain the differences in the two data sets.",
