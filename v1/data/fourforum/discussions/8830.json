   "Here's an interesting thing to think about. All of the energy on this planet comes from one single source. The energy it takes to run your car, illuminate your lights, or to walk down the street all comes from the same source. That source is the sun.\n \n Photosynthesis was the original means of capturing this energy and transferring it to alternate use. Plants did this in the beginning, and still do it today, and that is still the primary means of harnessing the suns energy. Anything that lives gets its energy from eating things, things that are made nutritious ultimately from photosynthesis, whether it is an animal that eats plants, or an animal that eats animals that eats plants.\n \n The dinosaurs nourished themselves from the sun in this way, and when they died that energy was eventually converted into fossil fuels. In that sense, things like oil and coal are no more than concentrated sunlight.\n \n That means that nowadays, we have developed a way of living that is dependant upon the finite stores of concentrated sunlight left here for us by the dinosaurs that preceded us. I wonder, is it possible to sustain even just the sheer number of people who exist now on only fresh sunlight energy as it arrives? Our modern technology can harness the suns energy more efficiently than it was harnessed by the dinosaurs in their fossils - but the dinosaurs were storing it for us for millions of years and we've almost used it all up.\n \n I wonder, how big the gap is between the rate at witch we can now harvest fresh sunlight as it arrives, and the rate at witch we are using stored sunlight.",

   "Here's an interesting thing to think about. All of the energy on this planet comes from one single source. The energy it takes to run your car, illuminate your lights, or to walk down the street all comes from the same source. That source is the sun.\n\n Aside from nuclear power, that is. That comes from a different sun.\n \n \n\n I wonder, is it possible to sustain even just the sheer number of people who exist now on only fresh sunlight energy as it arrives? Our modern technology can harness the suns energy more efficiently than it was harnessed by the dinosaurs in their fossils - but the dinosaurs were storing it for us for millions of years and we've almost used it all up.\n \n I wonder, how big the gap is between the rate at witch we can now harvest fresh sunlight as it arrives, and the rate at witch we are using stored sunlight.\n\n \n That's a really interesting question. The math should be simple. The earth is about 93 million miles from the sun, so it describes a sphere with an area of 4 pi r^2, or about 1.08 e17 miles squared. The earth presents a disk of about 500 million square miles, so about 4.7 e-11 % of the sun's energy hits the earth. The sun puts out about 3.86e33 ergs/second. Very roughly, that means that the earth is getting hit by 1e24 ergs/second, or 1e17 Watts. Human consumption is estimeated at 12 TW, or 1.2e13 Watts. That means that, if we had perfect efficency, the sun could provide 1000 times more power than we need. Of course this ignores the fact that human power consumption numbers don't take into account energy we get from food, or energy needed to keep the planet at a reasonable temperature. But roughly speaking we should be able to do without oil, which is the thrust of your question. If we had the tech we could live off of just the energy from the sun.",

   "Off course we can do without oil, it's just that we don't need to. Vast amounts of energy are locked in the ocean in the form of ... water. Forgot if you got the energy when you split oxygen and hydrogen or when they react and form a molecule. I'm not a chemist :) But anyway, there is a lot research going into it, especially when the oil prices are soaring. However the oil companies are some of the most powerful organzations in the world so they can basically if they want to (and they want to) control the development of alternative energy.",

However, we should be able to take the heavy water out of the sea and use it as fuel for fusion, and possibly in our life times. And that should be able to last us for quite some time, and be non-pollution to boot.",
