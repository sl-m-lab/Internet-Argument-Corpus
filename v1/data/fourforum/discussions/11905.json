The reality is that no single partisan can satisfy both sides of the aisle if he sticks with his own personal value system. And to suggest either side can is woefully naive. Just as a pro-life president is immediately perceived as a philosophical enemy of your side, so is a pro abortion president seen as an enemy to mine.\n \n But it is even more basic than that with Obama. Let's see if the Democratic majority reintroduces the Fairness Doctrine in order to demand that Conservative talk radio either offer opposing opinions of the left into their discourse or face huge fines, or even the loss of their broadcast license. And will he actually support restricting that exercise of free speech, or will he side with quenching any opposing views that criticize the secular humanist left? \n \n I know that he has said he wouldn't support the Fairness Doctrine, But that was campaign rhetoric. What he does in reality now that he has the power will tell whether your imaginary vision of what he represents is accurate or not. I believe he will attempt to limit freely offered opposition speech on the public airwaves since he is unable to force Americans to listen to liberal talk radio which always fails miserably in garnering an audience due to its defeatist and negative content which offers nothing more than america bashing to its listeners. DEMS GET SET TO MUZZLE THE RIGHT - New York Post\n DEMS GET SET TO MUZZLE THE RIGHT\n By BRIAN C. ANDERSON\n \n October 20, 2008 --\n SHOULD Barack Obama win the presidency and Democrats take full control of Congress, next year will see a real legislative attempt to bring back the Fairness Doctrine - and to diminish conservatives' influence on broadcast radio, the one medium they dominate.\n \n Yes, the Obama campaign said some months back that the candidate doesn't seek to re-impose this regulation, which, until Ronald Reagan's FCC phased it out in the 1980s, required TV and radio broadcasters to give balanced airtime to opposing viewpoints or face steep fines or even loss of license. But most Democrats - including party elders Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry and Al Gore - strongly support the idea of mandating \"fairness.\"\n \n Would a President Obama veto a new Fairness Doctrine if Congress enacted one? It's doubtful.\n \n The Fairness Doctrine was an astonishingly bad idea. It's a too-tempting power for government to abuse. When the doctrine was in effect, both Democratic and Republican administrations regularly used it to harass critics on radio and TV.\n \n Second, a new Fairness Doctrine would drive political talk radio off the dial. If a station ran a big-audience conservative program like, say, Laura Ingraham's, it would also have to run a left-leaning alternative. But liberals don't do well on talk radio, as the failure of Air America and indeed all other liberal efforts in the medium to date show. Stations would likely trim back conservative shows so as to avoid airing unsuccessful liberal ones.\n \n Then there's all the lawyers you'd have to hire to respond to the regulators measuring how much time you devoted to this topic or that. Too much risk and hassle, many radio executives would conclude. Why not switch formats to something less charged - like entertainment or sports coverage?\n \n For those who dismiss this threat to freedom of the airwaves as unlikely, consider how the politics of \"fairness\" might play out with the public. A Rasmussen poll last summer found that fully 47 percent of respondents backed the idea of requiring radio and television stations to offer \"equal amounts of conservative and liberal political commentary,\" with 39 percent opposed.\n \n Liberals, Rasmussen found, support a Fairness Doctrine by 54 percent to 26 percent, while Republicans and unaffiliated voters were more evenly divided. The language of \"fairness\" is seductive.\n \n Even with control of Washington and public support, Dems would have a big fight in passing a Fairness Doctrine. Rush Limbaugh & Co. wouldn't sit by idly and let themselves be regulated into silence, making the outcome of any battle uncertain. But Obama and the Democrats also plan other, more subtle regulations that would achieve much the same outcome.\n \n He and most Democrats want to expand broadcasters' public-interest duties. One such measure would be to impose greater \"local accountability\" on them - requiring stations to carry more local programming whether the public wants it or not. The reform would entail setting up community boards to make their demands known when station licenses come up for renewal. The measure is clearly aimed at national syndicators like Clear Channel that offer conservative shows. It's a Fairness Doctrine by subterfuge.\n \n Obama also wants to relicense stations every two years (not eight, as is the case now), so these monitors would be a constant worry for stations. Finally, the Democrats also want more minority-owned stations and plan to intervene in the radio marketplace to ensure that outcome.\n \n It's worth noting, as Jesse Walker does in the latest Reason magazine, that Trinity Church, the controversial church Obama attended for many years, is heavily involved in the media-reform movement, having sought to restore the Fairness Doctrine, prevent media consolidation and deny licenses to stations that refuse to carry enough children's programming.\n \n Regrettably, media freedom hasn't been made an issue by the McCain campaign, perhaps because the maverick senator is himself no fan of unbridled political speech, as his long support of aggressive campaign-finance regulation underscores. But the threat to free speech is real - and profoundly disturbing.\n \n Brian C. Anderson is editor of City Journal and co-author, with Adam Thierer, of \"A Manifesto for Media Freedom,\" just out from Encounter Books.\n \n Here's more about Obama's actual agenda from his campaigns perspective. Fairness Doctrine and another book about Obama...unmasked - www.hillaryclintonforum.net\n Ortiz continued:\n \n \"He considers this debate to be a distraction from the conversation we should be having about opening up the airwaves and modern communications to as many diverse viewpoints as possible. That is why Sen. Obama supports media-ownership caps, network neutrality, public broadcasting, as well as increasing minority ownership of broadcasting and print outlets.\"\n \n Forget about those short-sighted liberal plots to silence Rush Limbaugh and all those other pesky conservative talk-radio hosts. Obama has a bigger vision!\n \n \"Media Ownership Caps... ?\" Ortiz's statement is very clear! Obama wants the whole enchilada! Essentially Ortiz is saying that the federal government should control and regulate exactly who owns a media outlet. \n \n \"[i]ncreasing Minority Ownership of Broadcast And Print Outlets... ?\" Not enough minority owned stations? Not a problem? The government can fix that too! Let's extend Affirmative-Action to the airwaves. Maybe the Rev. Jeremiah Wright will get his own show. He can call it; \"The God D___ American Hour.\"\n \n \"Diverse Viewpoints... ?\" With the exception of talk-radio and FOX News , the Left already has a broadcast and print monopoly. Is Ortiz possible saying that we need the government to enforce the dissemination of MORE conservative thoughts and opinions on the airwaves? Doubtful! \n \n It appears that Obama is ONLY against the so-called \"Fairness Doctrine\" because he really wants to impose an UBER-FAIRNESS DOCTRINE!\n \n And that's NOT good news for any American who values free speech!\n \n There is a fix. Congressman Mike Pence has proposed legislation, The Broadcaster Freedom Act (HR 2905), which would thwart future efforts to bring back the so-called \"Fairness Doctrine.\"\n \n And IF it could get a vote in the House of Representatives, IT WOULD PASS!\n \n But Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi -- in what is becoming an all too typical maneuver -- is REFUSING TO BRING THE BROADCASTER FREEDOM ACT TO THE FLOOR FOR A FAIR UP-OR-DOWN VOTE!\n \n Don't let Barack Hussein Obama, or Nancy Pelosi or Harry Reid legislate a monopoly of liberal thought on the airwaves. Use this hyperlink or the button below to send 27 FAXES to President George W. Bush and EACH and EVERY Member of the Leadership of the United States House of Representatives.\n \n Tell them that the American people should be free to decide whether they want to listen to Rush Limbaugh, or Sean Hannity or Laura Ingraham. We do not live in the former Soviet Union and liberals in Congress have no right to decide what the American people should or should not hear! \n \n Is that your idea of all inclusive jito? By restricting free speech for all americans in order to insure that the Left controls the debate on americas air waves? And this is just one example of the heavy handed legislation that will come from this extremist. Oh, and btw, he won because he bought the election by out marketing the opposition and spending more money in this campaign than both Bush/Kerry spent combined in 04, just 4 years ago. Deny it if you like, and if his campaign promises were true and based in fact, I would have supported him also, but since he told every special interest just what they wanted to hear, then nothing he said is reliable at all.

   "I believe that your hope is very misplaced jito. The reality is that no single partisan can satisfy both sides of the aisle if he sticks with his own personal value system. And to suggest either side can is woefully naive.

Obama was elected because he was the \"rock star\". He could have run on a steal-candy-from-babies platform and still been elected, for cryin' out loud. The only reliable thing we had to go by concerning his 'value system' is his voting record, and it's one of the more liberal in Washington.

(We'll all get to pay the price for that after he gets elected!)\n \n I think two big factors got him elected ...\n \n - One, is the rock star / mania factor. The fad thing. \n \n - Two, honestly, is that a lot of African Americans wanted to vote in an African American. Let's call it what it is. Why else would the African American vote suddenly shoot up so much higher when an African American is running? It's not like there haven't been viable candidates all along.

It seemed so from my end (but, I've been watching this election #### for 8 hrs a day for the past 1.5+ years...I'm GLAD it's over.)\n \n As to why people voted for Obama. I do believe the funds gained and spent allowed him to keep harping his easy to digest mantra of \"Change\" and with him building on the negative perception of the Bush admin., he was a sho-in once he defeated his democratic opposition (Shrillary old school Clinton).\n \n People saw in him the blank slate and juxtaposed their desires onto him.\n He was everything to everyone. Charisma and flair with no substance but that that your poured into him yourself.\n He, like anyone else, has a chance to do decent. Rule from the center and try to govern well for ALL people Or, he can degenerate into partisanship and corruption.\n \n Personally, I think the mess he has to deal with is too big and when you heap more junk onto it in the future...he could be overwhelmed.\n But, if he can 'fix things', he could become a great president.\n \n Actually, he has to be a great president...the alternative is he gives all blacks a bad name for his incompetence and racism resurges.\n \n This of course ties in with the **** fest of 2012 that's right around the corner.\n \n \n \n I just wonder what the hands up his arse are thinking.",

I am as opposed to Liberal Govt. as a person can be. But Obama did win and he IS our president. I love this country all the more because when Bush's term is over he will gladly and peacefully hand over the keys of the White House to Obama as he would to McCain. If I'm in a foreign country (not that I will be but...) and someone says something about Obama or my country, I will defend him and it. I don't agree with Obama's view of the govt. and its responsibilities, but I agree that he's the president. When he proposes something I disagree with, I will do everything in my power to oppose it but I won't diminish his office. That's what the left did with Bush.",
