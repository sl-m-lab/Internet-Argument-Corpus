   "Home : WRH Store : WRH Index : Reader Letters : Archives : Advertise : Donate Babel Fish Translation\n In early 2001, at the start of Mr. Bush's presidency, his Government's Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) warned that a hurricane hitting New Orleans would be the deadliest of the three most likely catastrophes facing America; the others were a massive San Francisco earthquake and, prophetically, a terrorist attack on New York. [Independent]\n FEMA was in New York\n the Night Before 9/11\n \n Click HERE for a RealAudio recording of a statement made by FEMA spokesman Tom Kenney to Dan Rather on Wednesday, September 12th, 2001. In this interview, Kenney states that FEMA was deployed to New York on Monday night, September 10th, to be ready to go into action on Tuesday morning, September 11th.\n \n Kenney: \"We're currently one of the first teams that was deployed to support the city of New York for this disaster. We arrived on late Monday night, and went into action on Tuesday morning. And not until today did we get a full opportunity to work the entire site.\"\n \n Needless to say, this recording caused quite a stir. The official reaction was Kenney was simply confused about the dates.\n The Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it did not have urban search and rescue teams in place in New York City prior to the Sept. 11 attacks, contrary to an Internet-based rumor alleging otherwise. ... FEMA officials said Kenney, in the heat of the moment, misstated his team's arrival date. [WorldNetDaily 11/15/01]\n \n However, on the recording Kenney is complaining about not getting full access to the site until \"today\". Kenney talks about a Monday, a Tuesday, and \"today\". That's three days.\n \n Ifthe above recording was made on Wednesday, September 12th as claimed, then the explanation that Kenney was simply confused about the days doesn't work, because there is one more day than can be accounted for.\n \n Some news sources went to great lengths to dismiss Kenney's remarks...\n Information provided through FOIA requests ... show that FEMA had no personnel in place Sept. 10, 2001 - the day before Sept. 11, 2001 - which would have suggested the agency had prior knowledge of the terrorist attacks.\n \n \"This interview [with Tom Kenney] took place sometime on the 13th, two full days after all hell had broken loose,\" [Devvy Kidd - former head of the now-defunct Wallace Institute] said, noting that she has an audio copy of Rather's interview. \"Kenney sounds winded on the audio as if he had been exerting himself. It is more than likely Kenney, having worked virtually nonstop since his arrival in NYC, had his days run together, and his statement simply came out wrong.\" [WorldNetDaily 11/27/02]\n \n ...but the cover story was blown when Rudolph Guliani testified before the 9/11 Commission:\n \n Long Debunked \"Rumor\" Validated by Giuliani\n \n FEMA in NYC prior to 9-11 for Project TRIPOD terror drill, scheduled for 9-12\n \n As of this writing, June 2, 2004, the transcript of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's testimony to the 9-11 Commission during the May 18-19, 2004 hearings in New York is the only transcript of that hearing omitted from the Commission website\n (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States).\n \n Did Rudy say something wrong?\n \n \"... the reason Pier 92 was selected as a command center was because on the next day, on September 12, Pier 92 was going to have a drill, it had hundreds of people here, from FEMA, from the Federal Government, from the State, from the State Emergency Management Office, and they were getting ready for a drill for biochemical attack. So that was gonna be the place they were going to have the drill. The equipment was already there, so we were able to establish a command center there, within three days, that was two and a half to three times bigger than the command center that we had lost at 7 World Trade Center. And it was from there that the rest of the search and rescue effort was completed.\"\n \n Major questions exist as to why FEMA would deny being in New York City prior to 9/11 without mentioning the 9/12 bioterror drill. These questions must now be addressed as the initial suspicions of those who learned of the Tom Kenney statement have been clearly validated. The coincidental presence of a large FEMA team in NYC at the location, Pier 92, which became the Command Center for the entire emergency operation is disturbing. An alert press and a legitimate 9-11 Commission should have raised this issue long ago. [Scoop]\n \n emoticon_xdonno",

These studies also found that when the murder occurred [a]bout 11% of murder arrestees [were] actually on pre-trial release--that is, they were awaiting trial for another offense. \n \n The fact that only 75% of murderers have adult crime records should not be misunderstood as implying that the remaining 25% of murderers are non-criminals. The reason over half of those 25% of murderers don't have adult records is that they are juveniles. Thus, by definition they cannot have an adult criminal record. Juvenile criminal records might well show these murderers to have extensive serious criminal records. \n\n \n \n \n   Violence in America - Effective Solutions \n more than two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are involved with drug trafficking or have evidence of ante-mortem illicit drug use.\n \n Not only do the data show that acquaintance and domestic homicide are a minority of homicides,[26] but the FBI's definition of acquaintance and domestic homicide requires only that the murderer knew or was related to the decedent. That dueling drug dealers are acquainted does not make them \"friends.\" Over three-quarters of murderers have long histories of violence against not only their enemies and other \"acquaintances,\" but also against their relatives.\n \n The gun control advocacy literature from the \"medical community\" shows that fully two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are, in fact, drug dealers and their customers who wreak tremendous human and economic havoc upon society. In failing to account for this, the medical literature cannot and does not honestly assess these deaths.&#8221; \n",

   "Open your eyes\n It already has happened\n \n The U.S. gun industry sold at least twenty-five 50 caliber sniper rifles to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network, a study released by the Violence Policy Center (VPC) today reports. The study, Voting From the Rooftops, details the tremendous power of the Barrett M82A1 50 caliber sniper rifles&#65533; which U.S. Marines used in the Gulf War to knock out Iraqi armored vehicles from 1,750 yards away&#65533;and the gun's potential use to commit terror acts that could cause enormous casualties. The Barrett sniper rifle has spawned a bourgeoning market for these types of weapons that are becoming cheaper, lighter and more widely available. There are known to be at least fifteen 50 caliber sniper rifle manufacturers&#65533;nearly double the number of companies that were manufacturing and marketing 50 calibers to civilians in1999.\n \n \"We can be shocked, but not surprised that the gun industry would sell these dangerous military weapons to Al Qaeda,\" said the study's author, Tom Diaz, VPC's senior policy analyst. \"These 50 caliber sniper rifles are ideal tools for terror and assassination.\"\n\n \n Yeah you and the VPC...the VPC I am so impressed,what makes the 50 cal.\n any worse than the 308,30-06,7mm mag. as a sniper rifle?Oh thats right they will be used to shoot down jet liners, I guess if they are slaved to a radar system.\n \n Assassination?I think a person can be just a little closer than 1-1.5 miles\n And we sold 25 twenty-five 50 caliber sniper rifles to Al Qaeda?OK so says \n the VPC.emoticon_xdonno\n \n 2/03 Barrett Firearms Deserves Our Support\n Sunday, 28 September 2008 19:00\n Barrett Firearms Deserves Our Support\n by\n Michael Gaddy\n \n As published in Sierra Times[http://www.SierraTimes.com]\n \n Below is a letter from Mr. Ronnie Barrett to the Chief of Police in Los Angeles California. Barrett's position should be one all firearms manufacturers take in dealing with law enforcement agencies that toe the line of their tyrannical employers who support disarming the public.\n \n Barrett has seen himself become the primary target of the Washington based Violence Policy Center. The VPC has engaged in a program of deception and out and out lies against Barrett Firearms Company. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, VPS released the following outrageous statement:\n U.S. Gun Industry Sent Weapons to Osama bin Laden.\n \n The transfer of 25 Barrett anti-armor sniper rifles was revealed in the 2001 criminal trial of bin Laden operatives convicted of bombing two U.S. embassies in Africa. Government witness Essam al Ridi, a naturalized Egyptian, testified that he bought the 25 anti-armor sniper rifles and shipped them to bin Laden's group.\n \n Upon delving further into VPC's release, we learn that the time frame was 1988-89, during a period when the U.S. was aiding bin Laden and his rebels in their fight against the soon-to-be-former Soviet Union. Further investigation reveals that Barrett sold these items to the U.S. Government, and it was they who sent the .50 caliber \"anti-armor\" rifles to the Middle East.\n \n Tired of dealing with the propaganda campaign of the antigun crowd, Ronnie Barrett decided to fight fire with fire and sent this letter to the Chief of Police in Los Angeles. We should all use this letter as an example and mail it to all the folks in the firearms industry and urge they follow Barrett's shining example.",

You think you know me? Do you even know what it is like to live in an Inner City, or Public Housing? You think I am a coward? \n \n What would you do.\n \n I became disabled, and had to retrain for a new career. I had no family that could help so I had to move into a Cleveland Housing projects while I went back to college. While there I saw massive drug dealing, which also drew prostitution, and gambling. I saw street or parking lot gambling, public intoxication, and public urination, and an occasional dead body, all from the drug dealing. However, I figured that the drug dealers weren't bothering me so what did I care. After all, I was only going to be there for a very short time and it is a victimless crime right? \n \n Victimless Crime? Ah huh!\n \n Allow me to first expel a few falsehoods. First of all, most every one of the drug dealers were NOT residence of the housing project, and neither were they the majority of their customers. Most all of the residents, although many were undereducated, were, in fact, good-hearted people who were, for the most part, good neighbors too.\n \n I was speaking to a neighbor, single mother of 2, and she was telling me that her children do not sleep on their beds at night. When I pressed her about this, she embarrassed admitted that her children sleep under their beds because of the almost nightly gunfire from the Drug dealers, and their patrons. Not residents. Most of the gun fire was from the drug dealers showing off, I am figuring, or testing out a gun being traded for crack. Any way, when I heard this, I lost my Natural mind. I thought to myself that in no way would I allow this to go on while I was on this Earth, while I could do something about it. I called the cops, and was referred to the Housing police. They said they would do about as much as they can but their efforts were pretty ineffective. So I video taped all of the actors doing their crimes and took telephoto still pictures for positive identification and never told a sole that I was doing it because just before this, a church worker was murdered by the drug dealers because he inadvertently video taped a drug dealer while producing a video to try and spur donations. \n \n I mailed it to the Housing police and told my Senator, John Glenn about everything and his office got involved. They told the Housing authority, and the DEA, I think and contacted my Ohio State elected officials. There was an attempt to clean up the problem but it was not in any way what I thought the effort should be since the evidence I gathered had them dead to rights. They instead said they were going to concentrate their efforts on the Drug Buyers instead of the sellers. I thought, What? That isn't going to solve anything, but I waited to see the results. Noting! Absolutely Nothing, but a show.\n \n It was not long after the show that the son of a neighbor came over and told me that Moody, the head of the drug dealers was going to kill me, because he somehow found out about the video tapes and the photos. I talked to the Cleveland Police, and was again referred to the housing police, so I went down to their office and talked to the Captain, who informed me that I was, indeed, in a heap of danger. I asked him what I could do and he told me that if I did not own a gun to buy one and carry it. He explained that (Before Ohio's CCW laws) there was a statute on the books called the prudent man defense. It seemed that the Ohio legislators in their wisdom, did not want to make any laws that violated common sense and put the law abiding in a trick bag for running afoul of a law that they could in no way obey. Hense, the Prudent Man Defense. \n \n To make a painfully long story short, I was once confronted by a drug dealer, and I produced my pistol. After that all of the Drug Dealers left me along, but was told that Moody was still planning to kill me. \n \n My friend from school knows a Cleveland Cop and told him about what was happening to me with a whole bunch of harassment and vandalism, and my friend was told by the cop, \" Let the Black uneducated people kill each other! My friend explained that I was white and a Veteran and that I did not deserve to be left totally unprotected the way I was, and the cop again said, \" I Said! Let the Negroes Kill each other.\" Which was extremely typical of my experience there.\n \n At any rate, Moody was shortly arrested and convicted of murdering someone else and the Drug Dealers moved down as far away from me as they could. Before I left, only two people were ever arrested. Moody and another drug dealer, but no arrest were ever made even after all of the evidence I presented.\n \n So you can blow and go all you want to, but guns also save lives. And From what I later found out, I was just one of the 2.5 Million Defensive Gun uses every year.",

   "They face greater dangers than you.\n Its like you walk around with body armor and swat gear on.\n People would think youre paranoid. \n One thing thats obvious is I can live my life and face dangers without a gun which shows I have more bravery and guts than people like tither, Doc Jones, Nato and old sarge.\n Young children walk around unarmed but those cowards are grown adults who are paranoid about taking a step outside their house if theyre not packing\n they self medicate their paranoia with a gun when what they really need is a good shrink\n\n \n Then why do you continue to run from me, Brady? I could see it being different if I were using sticks and stones....\n \n Remember poor Mr. Benjamin Lynde Oliver-how you quoted an anti-gun statement of his and then to make him sound more important you decided to claim he was a \"founder\" of our nation: \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/11420-challenge-redux-5.html#post344814\n \n Did it upset you when I noted that he was born Sept. 14, 1788, and would have been all of 9 months old when Madison introduced the amendments to the convention? Did it hurt your feelings when I asked you to find his speech in support or against the passage of the amendments, and in jest suggested any such speech would have been short because a 9 month old would have been a man of few words? Is that why you ran from that post?\n \n Look, I can understand you getting that wrong-history is obviously something you find challenging and it's hard to verify information when all you do is cut and paste things that sounded good to you at the time. But you said this was an example of \"many antigun quotes from the founders\"? You've had over half a year since I last asked you if you had examples of others. Have you found any others yet, or was that statement just one more lie from you?\n \n Does asking questions like this make you run from me (or scream at your monitor)?\n \n Or, do you avoid me because I catch you lying, like I did here:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/11381-rise-police-deaths-because-no-ban-assault-weapons-2.html#post317246\n \n You started that thread. But when I called you on your lie you tried to change the subject-only to have your new claim crushed-and I reminded you again that changing the subject was not the way to address your previous lie. \n \n Now I'm beginning to suspect that exchange was the straw that broke the back of the camel trying to carry our online debate. I have found you since that thread, but every time I have asked you for a debate and said its time for you to either go or get off the pot you have crawled out the bathroom window. \n \n Look, I don't post out of the blue making assertions and asking you to debate me. I wait to address you in your comfort zone-when I find you start a new thread topic-hoping that since you picked both the time and the subject you would feel confident enough to finally engage me should I come calling. Why do you still run from me?\n \n Will you finally stop long enough to engage me on the topic of this thread (or any other of your choosing)? Or must I resign myself to a future of hearing a rapidly receding silhouette shout out that it's really others who are the true cowards here? \n \n Brady, people will not always believe what you say, but they will always believe what you do. \n \n Read Theodore Roosevelt and gird your loins like a man, Brady.\n \n ---\n \n \"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. Shame on the man of cultivated taste who permits refinement to develop into fastidiousness that unfits him for doing the rough work of a workaday world. Among the free peoples who govern themselves there is but a small field of usefulness open for the men of cloistered life who shrink from contact with their fellows. Still less room is there for those who deride of slight what is done by those who actually bear the brunt of the day; nor yet for those others who always profess that they would like to take action, if only the conditions of life were not exactly what they actually are. The man who does nothing cuts the same sordid figure in the pages of history, whether he be a cynic, or fop, or voluptuary. There is little use for the being whose tepid soul knows nothing of great and generous emotion, of the high pride, the stern belief, the lofty enthusiasm, of the men who quell the storm and ride the thunder. Well for these men if they succeed; well also, though not so well, if they fail, given only that they have nobly ventured, and have put forth all their heart and strength. It is war-worn Hotspur, spent with hard fighting, he of the many errors and valiant end, over whose memory we love to linger, not over the memory of the young lord who \"but for the vile guns would have been a valiant soldier.\"\" Theodore Roosevelt \"Citizenship in a Republic,\" Speech at the Sorbonne, Paris, France April 23, 1910.",
