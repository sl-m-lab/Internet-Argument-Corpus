   "sglaine,\n \n You and I go back a ways, so take this as advice from a friend.\n \n You need to relax. Your comments are getting more and more out there, and you're resorting to personal attacks and name calling, which is always unacceptable. You'd be out on your ear right now at FTE, even in the glory days of the Pig Pen.\n \n Everyone has been very calm and considerate of you so far, for the most part, and I applaud them for that. However, lately you've done far more to discredit yourself than you have to advance your ideas. Simply because someone disagrees with you doesn't mean they're brain washed or ignorant. You have to consider/understand the oppositions side of the arguement in order to truly understand yours, remember that.\n \n You've got some valid points, but you need to present them calmly and logically, simply repeating them doesn't make them right. You need to research them and provide some supporting evidence. \n \n Waxy\n I agree a 100% with you but if you look at all of my post you will clearly find that I did not start the attacts. If the others start treating me with a little respect I will do the same we are here supposed to have some friendly debates Because others do not agree with me witch they dont have to and I agree because we are all different. Does not mean that they can slam one another I will becareful in the future.",

   "I'm going to have to question your methods for luring people into debates. Although I do agree with you mostly, I think you're being a bit too antagonistic, and this thread doesn't really have much substance.\n\n Oh Mamboni it does have a lot of substannce. And it has a lot of meaning because if Bush gets back in everbody is going to lose out on there finanacial gain and there houses ect ect. What I am getting at here is Bush did not live by his campane promises in 2000. And he can not betrusted now. And if you beleve all of the economy figgers I feel for you because it will come out later that it is a farse.",

We should be working Affganastan harder. And yes I did serve my country for 8 years. I am not a college dummy. I will support a war if there is justcause but not on hearsay. get my point.",

Yes Clinton has lied but what goes on under a desk should not be anyones desk concern. That really had nothing to do with running the country. Yes they all lie about one thing or another but the bottom is here at least the others lately did not lie that involved a war & death. Yes we needed to go to Afghanistan but we did not need to go to Iraq under the circumstance. Yes we could have addressed it later. And also the lies from the other president did not involved billions of dollars. Let me tell you I do support the troops but I dont support the WAR.",
