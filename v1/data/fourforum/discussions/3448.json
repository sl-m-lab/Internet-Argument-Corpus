   "C'MON, based on all the shady tactics of the Liberals, who can believe anything from them anymore..truth is dead. I wouldn't put it past the slime to make up things to further their goals..wait, they already have LOL The ultimate conspiracy is being played out before out very eyes but you whackos are so concerned about your \"team\" winning that you could care less what long term effects it will have on this country. Like I said, when the civil war begins, the wimps and sissies will lose...hmmmmmm, maybe that could be a good thing, huh? :-D \n \n \nThose Republicans will stop at nothing in their thirst for power \n\n \n COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT!!! :-D",

   "haha the very same can be said about Republicans.\n\n\n \n I'm not so sure about that, Dems/Libs have long had the reputation of stuffing ballots with the \"dead\" and \"made up\". Dems/Libs have a warped idea of who has the right to vote...I saw a story about California where to register to vote all you need is a name and address. The Dems/Libs are fighting to allow ILLEGALS the right to vote, and when a Republican has tried to enforce the Constitution and limit it to CITIZENS, he gets criticized for being racist/discriminatory and only doing this to keep Reublicans in power! LOL Not like you could say that the Dems/Libs are spitting on the Constitution in order to stay in power themselves! THAT'S illegal and shady if you ask me...wouldn't you agree? The Dems/Libs putting out the e-mails to their drones to saturate the polls to reflect that their guy won the debates..hell, Kerry and Edwards could have come out and blown spit bubbles all night, and you all would have said they won the debates LOL Seems kinda juvenile and sleezy, I could even say reminescent of Goebbels..the power of propaganda, people are like sheep and go with the flow, so you all know if the polls overwhelmingly show your guy winning, the weak minded will go with the flow. The \"disenfranchisement\" of the Blacks in Florida in 2000 was a complete lie, no argument..THAT'S sleazy. In fact, I have no doubt in my mind that when they saw the count was close in Florida, the DNC had some drones complain about ballots intentionally (I vaguely recall something like this coming up at the time involving Graham, but naturally the press made little of it), Anyway, there are probably countless examples, but offhand that's it for now",

In summary, your upset that Democrats are trying to register new voters, an obviously biased poll shows bias to its party, and finally, voting improprieties from the 2000 election (which the Republicans won) were all completely fabricated. The post is a little long on opinion, accusations, and unsubstantiated data.",
