Life itself isn't special and despite hundreds of debates here no one has been able to define human (as its term for a category of things that don't really exist). Feel free to have a go if you like though, I just think a mind is the thing that matters, I don't see why comparing DNA between things is relevant.\n \n \n\n My Mom was a qualified nurse, and she's told me that it does indeed harm the woman much more to have an abortion.

My Mom had eleven children, and she never felt extreme pain so long after giving birth. You want you're proof, there it is.\nThat isn't proof, child birth can cause huge amounts of problems both physiologically and psychologically - it just isn't serious very often.

No way!\n I afraid that's a ridiculous arguement and not one to bring up in such an issue as this. Not only would I be showing some kinds of brain activity in a coma (which doesn't nessarily mean brain dead) but there are other factors involved as well based on what other people want not to mention that there is a difference between something that has never had a brain and someone who is asleep. It might worry you to know that if you end up brain dead on life support then you will most likely get your machine switched off. \n \n \n \n \n\n Because the irresponsible girl or women who didn't consider this before they had sex is obligated to take care of it.

What would you class as yourself, your mind, part of your body, your entire body? Given that every single atom in our body is replaced at least once over the course of our lifetime I don't see how we can be anything physical.\n \n Until something has a developed brain why should I worry about it - its the same as feeling empathy with a chair. It has no feelings, no thoughts, no experience or memory - its just a wet mass getting bigger until it develops enough to gain these things (at which point I don't beleive you should be able to abort it). If the mother is obligated to care of a child, then she has to have the ability to prevent this from occuring otherwise you are really just punishing her with a child. \n I don't think it is better to kill a child than have it go unwanted - but I see no problem with preventing that child from coming into existance because it would be unwanted. Its no different really from not having sex in the first place.",

Not all women go through this, but all the risks involved FOR the mother make abortion much more dangerous for herself. Therefore, it is safer to have a birth than an abortion. \n \n Such operations need to be done while the baby is INSIDE the mother's body. (Such as tearing the baby to pieces, for instance. THAT is dangerous) Whether it's pain or fertility or uterus damage, the abortion methods cannot gaurantee safety for the woman and insures many risks involved that endanger the health of the woman.

I'll post some here that I got from http://www.angelfire.com/nj3/rebekah8370/\n \n 95% of abortions are done as birth control, 1% are done because of rape/incest, 1% because of fetal abnormalities, and 3% due to the mother's health problems. \n \n Abortions outnumber live births in 14 major metropolitan areas. \n \n 45% of the women that walk into an abortion clinic have already had at least 1 previous abortion. \n \n Child abuse has gone up 500% since the legalization of abortion. \n \n 95% of women who have had an abortion say that the abortion clinic gave them little or no information about the fetus living inside of them. \n \n Many people believe that women who are victims of rape and become pregnant by this violent act is a good reason for them to have an abortion. In Victims and Victors (Acorn Books, 2000), a book written by David Reardon, Amy Sobie, and Julie Makimma, 192 women were interviewed.

   "I guess statistics are what you want. I'll post some here that I got from http://www.angelfire.com/nj3/rebekah8370/\nYup, stats make me feel all warm and tingley!\n \n\n 95% of abortions are done as birth control, 1% are done because of rape/incest, 1% because of fetal abnormalities, and 3% due to the mother's health problems. \n However of those 95%, the vast majority are going to be due failure in conventional birth control. Only a small percent are likely to actually rely on abortion as sole means of birth control.\n \n\n [B]Abortions outnumber live births in 14 major metropolitan areas. \nNot sure on the revelance here, not to mention this stat will be squewed in a lot of cases as abortion clinics are rarely out on a farm somewhere. If you really want people to adopt, we should speak globally as well.\n \n\n 45% of the women that walk into an abortion clinic have already had at least 1 previous abortion.\nThis needs some more stats to go with it before we can start to really analyse it, backgrounds, reasons for abortions etc.\n \n \n\n Child abuse has gone up 500% since the legalization of abortion.\nGlobal warming has also skyrocketed with the decline in pirate numbers\n \n\n 95% of women who have had an abortion say that the abortion clinic gave them little or no information about the fetus living inside of them.\n\n This is a rather odd question to ask, what exactly did people expect to be told?\n \n\n Many people believe that women who are victims of rape and become pregnant by this violent act is a good reason for them to have an abortion. In Victims and Victors (Acorn Books, 2000), a book written by David Reardon, Amy Sobie, and Julie Makimma, 192 women were interviewed. These women had had abortions after they became pregnant from rape. Nearly all the women said that they regretted the abortion, and over 90% said they would discourage other rape victims from choosing abortion. \n However 10% said it was a good thing, thats 1400 people a year by your numbers. Counciling is the issue here rather than an abortion one, we can't judge on this until we see from the other side of rape victims who kept their babies. Not to mention that regret can cover a huge range.\n \n\n 49% of pregnancies in America are unplanned. 50% of these unplanned pregnancies are ended by abortion. Out of all women who have abortions, 75% say they had an abortion because the baby would have interfered with their life; 66% say that they couldn't have afforded a baby; and 50% said they didn't want to be a single mother or were having problems with their partner. \nSeem valid reasons to me\n \n\n 14,000 abortions are done because of rape/incest. (This only makes up about 1% of all abortions.) \n Until we can see the full story on the benefits and harm of rape and abortion we can't say anything. \n \n \n \n\n I guess you can see that psychologcially, it most certainly does effect women; and much more than you thought.\n Those stats have said practically nothing, this isn't something that can just be solved with some nice soundbites to back up a political view. It requires genuine study, at the very least you need to compare rates of depression in mothers and people who have abortions, and factor into account the rates of depression experienced previous to conception. To be properly accurate you need to pick people from the same sort of background as well.\n \n\n Plus, have you seen the child abuse that has gone up since abortion was legalized?!

The upshot to me is that better education about birth control is sorely needed. \n \n \"Contraceptive Use Among U.S. Women Having Abortions in 2000-2001\n By Rachel K. Jones, Jacqueline E. Darroch and Stanley K. Henshaw \n \n CONTEXT: Knowing the extent to which contraceptive nonuse, incorrect or inconsistent use, and method failure account for unintended pregnancies ending in abortion, as well as reasons for nonuse and imperfect use, can help policymakers and family planning providers support effective contraceptive use. \n \n METHODS: Contraceptive use patterns among a nationally representative sample of 10,683 women receiving abortion services in 2000-2001 were examined, as well as reasons for nonuse, problems with the most frequently used methods and the impact emergency contraceptive pills have had on abortion rates. \n \n RESULTS: Forty-six percent of women had not used a contraceptive method in the month they conceived, mainly because of perceived low risk of pregnancy and concerns about contraception (cited by 33% and 32% of nonusers, respectively). The male condom was the most commonly reported method among all women (28%), followed by the pill (14%). Inconsistent method use was the main cause of pregnancy for 49% of condom users and 76% of pill users; 42% of condom users cited condom breakage or slippage as a reason for pregnancy. Substantial proportions of pill and condom users indicated perfect method use (13-14%). As many as 51,000 abortions were averted by use of emergency contraceptive pills in 2000. \n \n CONCLUSIONS: Women and men need accurate information about fertility cycles and about the risk of pregnancy when a contraceptive is not used or is used imperfectly. Increased use of emergency contraceptive pills could further reduce levels of unintended pregnancy and abortion. \n \n Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, 2002, 34(6):294-303\"",

   "This is how I look at it, as simply as I can type it out.\n \n You're reason for abortions are these.\n \n 1. Financial Limitations.\n \n 2. Education Goals\n \n 3. Health Needs\n \n 4. Career Situation\n \n 5. Family Situations\n \n None of which can justify killing. Career and Financial limitations can be fixed by giving up for adoption. (A person shouldn't risk getting pregnant if they're THAT concerned about their career anyway.)\n \n A good, kind person can come from an abusive family. Putting the child up for adoption might be better if the family is abusive. At least, better than KILLING it and giving it no chance at all.\n \n Plus, there is no child on this earth that isn't a financial burden. Health problems, disease and infections are all risked in sex. Considering \"Health Needs\" Things like that should be considered beforehand. Birth Control is far from perfect, and it's failure to prevent pregnancies is no reason to kill.\n \n If A person values their career or education above letting their own child live, they aren't deserving of the consideration shown when their mothers let them live.\n\n \n You either don't understand, or you are intentionally glossing over the period of pregnancy. I asked what you would do if you successfully outlawed abortions. Women are still going to get pregnant, and not want to be or be uable to care well for her own physical body, which adversely effects the fetus.\n \n A woman with financial limitations is not going to be able to provide adequate prenatal care. She may not have insurance. A woman with college/career problems may be too sick or physically unable to go to school or work. How will she provide for herself? A woman in an abusive relationship/family may get the XXXX kicked out of her for getting pregnant. No good for anyone here.\n \n No one is saying that adoption isn't a good choice for many. But you are forgetting that there are nine months to ride out first. \n You may not agree with these reasons for abortions, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. \n \n What are you going to help?",

He invited them to stay at the church for a few days and they would supply them with food..etc. While in the church, the person that found this family went to go get the food and inform the pastor. When he came back he noticed the family was taking all the money from the collection plate (previous service).

They got around 30 bucks instead of having a place to sleep, eat, and be taken care of. \n \n So if this person steals my bread...I won't be able to catch them.

They are telling her that even if she were raped, even if she used birth control, even if she's 13, she has to have the baby? \n \n I hope that you are begining to understand where pro-choice people are coming from, specifically me: It's very upsetting to me to think that some (stereotype alert) old, rich, white man in a state capital whom I've never met, nor ever will meet introduces laws that would force me to give birth, a life changing, altering, and serious ordeal. I struggle to think of a comparative analogy. Can you?\n \n Does your stance on abortion come from a moral standpoint? If so, then I ask, why not allow the woman to deal with her morals? She's the one who has to live with herself; let her decide what to do. I say completely educate her about the post-abortion psychological/physiological effects, make her aware of what could happen. \n \n \nThe fetus may suffer abuse or bad family during its life, but at least it may live and may turn out into a nice, respectable person.

You have no chance at all.\n\n \n So are you saying that you wouldn't do anything in an abusive situation? \n Of course you think it's better to allow the fetus to live than die no matter what the situation, but you're kind of glossing over what I was originally asking. What are you going to do/tell the pregnant girl in this situation? Please don't just sweep it under the rug. It's a real issue, and one girls/women get abortions for.\n \n \nA woman who doesn't take proper care for her unborn child will endanger her own health, that is how she'll be forced to take care of it.

I find myself repeating myself...what if she is too sick to work, and simply can't afford survival? Can't pay rent, can't pay utility bills, can't pay groceries? That's going to endanger her and the fetus, and she's not going to magically be able to pay those things just because she's pregnant. \n \n \nYou are correct. 200-700$ is small compared to the extra things she'll need for nine months. But medical help is often needed after the abortion too, so it can be more as well. But the risk is still run when having sex, it's not the baby's fault.[/\n\n \n Medical help is often needed after the abortion? Like what? Don't forget that medical help is sometimes needed after birth as well.\n \n You keep coming back to this (bolded sentence). I get the point already; do you get the point that people have sex for other reasons than to have children?\n This is very personal, don't even answer-I don't want to know- just ask yourself- Have you ever had sex? If yes, do you consent to being a father every time you do it? \n ---------------------------\n Don't forget with your numbers, that not every abortion that happens in these states is gov't funded or assisted. Many are private, I just don't know how many. Can you find more specific stats?\n \n Phew, that was a novel. Thanks for continuing to debate with me. :)",

   "If you desire to abolish abortion, than yes, you are forcing (some) women to give birth. That's the truth of the anti-choice position. It's an awesome decision to make for someone, regardless of their input or lives. I hope you get to talk to some women/girls/couples who face unwanted pregnancies so you know more about their lives.\n \n So you're saying that women who have sex consent to giving birth? Do you consent to getting into a car accident every time you're in your car? \n I'll say it again; sex is not always about procreation.\n \n \n \n You know about abortion? How is that? \n \n Anti-choice people should not try to control a woman's reproductive system? Aren't they, though? They are telling her that she must give birth. They are telling her that even if she were raped, even if she used birth control, even if she's 13, she has to have the baby? \n \n I hope that you are begining to understand where pro-choice people are coming from, specifically me: It's very upsetting to me to think that some (stereotype alert) old, rich, white man in a state capital whom I've never met, nor ever will meet introduces laws that would force me to give birth, a life changing, altering, and serious ordeal. I struggle to think of a comparative analogy. Can you?\n \n Does your stance on abortion come from a moral standpoint? If so, then I ask, why not allow the woman to deal with her morals? She's the one who has to live with herself; let her decide what to do. I say completely educate her about the post-abortion psychological/physiological effects, make her aware of what could happen. \n \n \n \n So are you saying that you wouldn't do anything in an abusive situation? \n Of course you think it's better to allow the fetus to live than die no matter what the situation, but you're kind of glossing over what I was originally asking. What are you going to do/tell the pregnant girl in this situation? Please don't just sweep it under the rug. It's a real issue, and one girls/women get abortions for.\n \n \n \n What of the women who don't take care of themselves on a regular basis?

I've not had sex, not sure about whether I personally ever will.

You've asked me before what \"I\" would do for those unwanted unborn babies and what \"I\" would do to ensure their care. It seems to me that those question should be put to the mother and the father. \"THEY\" are the ones who had sex. \"THEY\" are the ones who ran the risk to their health, finances, career status and family status. \"THEY\" did it, \"THEY\" take resonsibility for \"THEIR\" actions. Should the baby have to die so they can avoid responsibility?\n \n I would not prevent men and women from having sex.

But nobody gets an abortion for those (I'm sure you know why) and nobody even knows about it till weeks after that happens. By then, in six weeks, it has arms, legs, a head and bones. And what if it doesn't have a nervous system? It still is a living human being with or without one, and it's going to get one eventually.\n\n \n You're right, development shouldn't matter much if you're looking at it from a morality standpoint, b/c it's going to 'eventually' get those necessary body systems for function. So if your morality is your argument, then those don't really matter.\n My thoughts are that it's incapable of thought or independent action. It has no pain centers, so there's no pain. It's like, nothing. My dog has more significance to me than a 6 week old fetus. Ah, blaspheme, many will say. That's fine. I know I treat my dogs better than many, many people treat their children.\n \n \nAs a matter of fact I did meet someone (online) who had had an abortion. She was a mother of... 2, I think, and her baby was significantly far ahead in its growth time. (She had had it for quite a few weeks) She was, I believe, one of the victims who have been told the possibilities of health problems for the baby in its life and was induced by the doctor and medical team into having an abortion for the best; despite the babies large chances of survival and birth without such things. (Bernard Nathanson talks of doctors who speak like this)\n \n She told me that the doctor had said that it \"definitely\" had undeveloped limbs and a bad case of illness that would have handicapped the baby in its mental capabilities. She did tell me that it was a heart-breaking decision and that she still mourns over her babies death. I didn't talk as civilly towards her as I could, but I did remain firm on the subject with her that they were only possibilites and that she did not even let the baby live to have a chance.\n \n Well, that's my story about that one. If you'd like to talk about that further we could.\n\n \n Wow, that's a horrible story. Sounds like she was a little railroaded into that decision. I hope you have some sympathy for her; she regrets her decision, and that's tough stuff. It's so easy to judge, so hard to feel empathy.\n \n Throughout our entire conversation, I've held back from saying that it is difficult for me, a 27 year old woman, to hear a 16 year old male say all these things. Of couse you are entitled to your opinion, and of course you are entitled to vote on such isses, etc. but it is truth that you will never actually have to make this decision for yourself. It's easier when you can't put yourself in another shoes because of biology. \n On a side note:\n I know there are many pro-life women. I wish I could find stats so I could know if my theory is right; the theory is that most pro-life women are indoctrinated with religious rhetoric. In which case, they're all wacko, b/c major religions of our day demote the status of women. Why would they want to belong to such an organization? emoticon_xangel I'm gonna get blasted for that. Heh.\n \n Cheers to you, Prototype, for having an open mind and taking these things into consideration! emoticon_xhoho",

   "I have not heard of this phenomenon of physicians exaggerating the need of an abortion and \"inducing\" women to have them. What would be the motivation of clinicians to do that?\n\n \n From what I gathered from his book, there is no evil intention behind it; necessarily. Doctors find it alright to do abortions (the pro-abortions ones) and as such, they believe that any circumstances regarding pregnancy or risks, they feel it is their job to try and convince them to do it. They don't consider anything morally wrong on this, they pretty much feel as if they did their job and that it's another accomplishment under their belt.\n \n \n \nAfter this woman had already had the abortion and was still mourning, what was to be gained by your actions?\n 1. Perhaps the doctor was telling her the truth. I would think this is most likely.\n 2. Perhaps the doctor was telling her this to ease her pain. \n 3. Do you think that discounting this \"possibility\" was constructive?\n 4. Do you think that berating her actions after the fact, to a woman who already was mourning, was helpful to her?\n \n Sounds kinda cold.\n\n \n For one thing, I did not come into the topic and search for her to berate her. She came to me in my posts and challenged me.\n \n Reason 1 -- There have been mothers who have been told of such things happening to their unborn infan,t and they let their baby be born. Guess what? They were fine. This doctor or medical team could very well have been wrong, but I think the persuasiveness of the doctor convinced her they were concrete.\n \n Reason 2. -- Perhaps. But I think it would be a better idea to tell her the baby still had a fighting chance. It still had a significant way to go before birth. That might have eased the pain in knowing it MIGHT have problems, but that something good could still come from it.\n \n Reason 3 -- No, I think discounting it was a low value of the human life. Killing it is worse than letting it live with a chance. That sounds better than a suggestion of total death, wouldn't it?\n \n Reason 4 -- I could have dealt with her more ethically, I admit. But I did not berate her like an old granny coming to switch her cane at her adult daughter and telling her to be grateful for everything she did for her. But she made the choice to come to the topic, read it, see my things and try to rebute what I had said. This is not an excuse for what I said, it was a diplomatic but firm debate, I will not be made a monster for holding my own view even in such a circumstance.",

   "Ah, you talk of sin. What is this, this \"sin\" concept? \n And what rights does an unborn fetus have? I suggest, that before we get into this, you read some of the other threads on \"unborn rights\". No sense beating a dead horse. \n\n \n My sin concept is based on my religion. The abortion issue is a whole other thing unaffected by my religion though, so don't attack that.\n \n I've read threads on this already. The laws of this country prohibit murder and killing of any person. A fetus is a person, isn't it? It looks an awful lot like one at five or six weeks, and that's the usual time for abortions. I could give you a link to some aborted babies at that age, unless you don't feel comfortable looking at them.\n \n \nBut it is going to be a punishment, if you abolish abortion. Mom's going to get punished for her sex life, whether you see it like that or not. If she's pregnant, doesn't want it, and is forced to continue (man, sounds like hell to me every time I type is out-a hellish society where women must surrender their reproductive organs to the whims of the gov't, to the morality of some people who consider their morals to be the best and push them against everyone else) that's punishment. Plain and simple. I can see it now; the finger wagging gov't official; \"You should have kept your legs together!\" to the 16 year old scared girl who's parents have disowned her, or will force her to keep the baby. How about the crack addict who prostitutes herself for crack? The 13 year old who didn't have any idea what sex was really for? The any year old who was raped? Incest cases? Or the poor, in debt so far up to her ears, 20 year old with no support system, and unable to work b/c she's so sick, about to be kicked out of her apartment, beaten by her boyfriend for \"catching pregnant\"?\n\n \n I'm going to punish her for becoming pregnant when she is doing everything possible that risks it? How is that unjust?\n \n Not all the abortion cases are about rape, especially the ones you mentioned. You cannot generalize and stretch extreme circumstances like these over the whole lot of abortions going on for other reasons. (And rape victims frequently believe in letting the baby live instead of continuing the violence by killing.)\n \n Plus, you are trying to compact every possible thing that can go wrong in a single case, and then you're trying to generalize this. If abortions are outlawed and women (and girls) are made to carry out their pregnancies, I would bet parents would be more careful about letting their child have sex; considering abortion is no longer a solution.\n \n \n \n \nTell me this; why do pregnant girls/women have to remain pregnant, in your opinion? Because it's the right thing to do? Is there such an absolute?\"?\n\n \n If you mean \"moral\" absolute, well... since America no longer bases its laws on a moral absolute, then it can't be argued on those grounds.\n \n I believe a baby is a person like you and me and deserves to live. And it should be considered murder to kill them; regardless of people thinking they can play God and end the life of an infant because of physical or medical deformities. (Sure, kill all the sick ones. That shows REEEAL humanity)\n \n Why do they have to remain pregnant? Well, in the first place, they don't need to become pregnant. The don't ever have to get pregnant. I think they should remain pregnant till the baby is born because they voluntarily performed such actions as to conceive.\n \n \n \n \nYou don't sound dumb at all; just young. There's a difference. :)\n \n Necessary evil...abortion in circumstances as above. If that's what the girl wants, and she's educated about her decision (as well as other options) then that is a necessary evil. Anyways, on a different tangent, don't we need evil to see the good??\"? \n\n \n Thank you, I think I understand now.\n \n \n \nYou're right, development shouldn't matter much if you're looking at it from a morality standpoint, b/c it's going to 'eventually' get those necessary body systems for function.

I know I treat my dogs better than many, many people treat their children. \n\n \n Don't worry, I won't condemn you for thinking your dogs are smarter and more capable than a baby that has yet to be born. :) Perfectly reasonable.\n \n No pain? Well, neither will a five year old in a coma if you kill him. Just because feeling isn't present doesn't mean it isn't murder.\n \n No independent action? A baby can kick, suck its thumb and even react to different types of music. That sounds like it needs a brain to do that.\n \n \n \nWow, that's a horrible story. Sounds like she was a little railroaded into that decision. I hope you have some sympathy for her; she regrets her decision, and that's tough stuff. It's so easy to judge, so hard to feel empathy. \n\n \n I do have sympathy, but not necessarily the kind you're thinking. I'm sad because she was persuaded through her doctor and/or medical team that it had to happen. And I do believe she was human enough to feel bad about her decision, I never forgot that. Believe me, it was kind of a shock when I read it and I didn't feel very happy afterwards.\n \n \nThroughout our entire conversation, I've held back from saying that it is difficult for me, a 27 year old woman, to hear a 16 year old male say all these things.

A person can still have a valid and correct view on a situation regardless of gender. But I can tell you this, that the biologically fertile being was born from another biologically fertile being that chose to let them live. I think their children should be allotted the same rights.\n \n \n \nOn a side note:\n I know there are many pro-life women.

A pro-abortionist can't excuse himself from such laws. Since more pro-lifers have found a moral basis for their views, they speak out more than a person who is pro-life with no other weapon than their belief in human rights and the justice system.\n \n Women who fight for rights concerning this are merely trying to ridicule their own religion if it happens to condemn them for abortions and that strikes them as taking away their rights. They count that as degredation so they can scream about injustice.\n \n That's my current theory, I stand to be corrected.",

My view is... well, I'll give you a reference to Bernard Nathanson's book. Chapter 10: The Vector Of Life, The Hand Of God\n \n A baby is capable of being born before nine months and before it is fully developed. It might be slow and behind in its mental developement and may not even be able to think of its own. But it is alive, and killing it then would be considered murder. I don't know why it isn't considered the same with babies in the womb.\n \n \nPeople do not always have sex to make babies. To condemn them for this is ridiculous, idealistic, and fantasy. \n\n \n I know they don't have sex just for procreation. Does that give them the right to kill?\n \n Perhaps you're talking of love. I wouldn't hold it against any man or woman to love, after all, my Mom and Dad had to to make me live.:) But that still doesn't excuse killing. It would see more like selfish love to do things that risk pregnancy and then kill because they want nothing of it. The baby never did anything wrong and didn't suddenly appear of its own will inside the mother. Why should it have to die? So they can do this and be able kill freely?\n \n \nEven if there is just one woman who was raped somewhere, I would not deny her a choice about her own violated body just because statisically the chance of her circumstance happening is very small.\n And that's great; since I'm pro-choice- that some rape victims choose to remain pregnant. More power to them; like heck if I feel I would be more qualified than they to make such a decision.\n\n \n The overwhelming majority of all abortions, (95%), are done as a means of birth control. \n \n Only 1% are performed because of rape or incest; \n \n 1% because of fetal abnormalities; \n \n 3% due to the mother's health problems.\n \n I found it here. http://www.abortiontv.com/Misc/AbortionStatistics.htm\n \n If you are willing to allow the death of at least 1.5 million babies around the world, I would think making it illegal and making just that 1% of women carry their babies to birth would be a better idea. It should to you, if I understand you correctly.\n \n \n \nA. Do you think I'm way off the mark here? Do you think that these things never happen?. \n\n \n I don't deny it does happen. But not as much as you're trying to extrapolate. Look at that site again.\n \n \nB. You bet parents would be more careful? Do you think that parents have that much control over their kids? And hey, don't forget about the kids who don't live at home anymore. You need to meet some more XXXXXX if you think that people are going to be more careful about having sex if abortion is no longer a solution. :)\n Man, you're generalizing all the individual reasons women have abortions under the heading of \"convenient\". I'm trying to show you that there's more to it than just \"convenience\". \n\n \n I think more people would be careful about it. Those females who don't have it just for the fun of it. It would reduce abortion rates quite significantly anyway, wouldn't you think so?\n \n \n \nThere we go. We're just going to butt heads until the end of time. I believe that a woman has priority numero uno, and since it's her body, she is the best decision maker in this situation. She has to live with herself, psychologically and physically. I don't. \n\n \n And the baby has his/her own body too. The question is this: Does the mother have the right to abort her baby based on concerns for her own body? I'm not saying she can't kill for her own safety (In that debate, only the mother can decide) but if she doesn't have anything to worry about beyond normal pregnancie risks;. Such as disease or infection because of the fetus and such.\n \n I don't care what the woman does with her body as long as she doesn't harm the other one.\n \n \nWho said kill all the sick ones? \n\n \n You didn't, I was more or less grumbling from one of the arguement brought up in pro-abortionists' debates on the possible concerns of the mother. \n \n \n \nDo you think that everytime someone has sex they are voluntarily committing themselves to get pregnant? \n\n \n No. But the risk is there 100% of the time, and they do it anyways. Shouldn't the mother (and father of course) be held responsible since they did it? It isn't like someone forced them to and told them to live with it. It's ridiculous to say they should be allowed to kill simply because they didn't do it for pro-creation.\n \n \nYour sarcasm is not appreciated, nor will help you get your point across. And on top, I didn't even say that. I said, they have more significance to me than a six week old fetus. A dog has personality, thinks, and determines it's actions. A six week old fetus isn't even 'there'.\n\n \n No, no no. You misunderstood me. I agreed with you whole-heartedly on what you said, I meant no sarcasm. Maybe I should think more before adding smilies.\n \n \n \nCareful where you use the word \"murder\". I'm sure you're aware that \"murder\" is the illegal killing of a creature. Abortion is not murder, soldiers in the field aren't murdering anyone, etc. \n\n \n A woman's body has nothing to do with the army, nor does the baby's. I think the definiton of murder should be more like this. \"To kill brutally or inhumanly.\" And believe me, the methods used are most certainly inhumane. I'm talking about 2nd trimester or third trimester thing, I'm sure you must understand.\n \n \nI knew this coma thing would come up. Is the child dependent on it's mother? Does the child have a fully developed brain, did the child have independent thought, and, lastly, does the mother want to keep it? Couldn't she just disconnect the life support? Is that moral?\n \n No, wait, I really don't want to get into that. A kid in a coma is not the same as a 6 week old fetus in the womb. The End.\n\n \n Very true.\n \n \n \n \nA six week old fetus? \n\n \n Perhaps not always. But there's no way to tell. The thing is this: Are you willing to let it be killed simply because it is incapable of these things?\n \n \n \n \nI'm glad you read about her experience. I hope you will not condemn her for her actions. That situation sucks. \n\n \n I cannot condemn her because I think she was deceived. That I admit. I don't let up on the fact that I still believe her actions were wrong.[/QUOTE]\n \n \n \nWill Ferrell is funny to both sexes. :)\n\n \n Who is he?\n \n \n \nI purposefully put in that of course you are entitled to your opinion and it doesn't invalidate anything you've said so you wouldn't have to type this.\n Interesting that you used the word \"chose\".

The model eventually dissolves, leaving a new, artificial womb that continues to thrive. \n \n In Japan, Dr. Yoshinori Kuwabara, a professor of obstetrics at Juntendo University, has created an artificial womb. He has successfully delivered goats from this artificial womb after just three weeks of gestation. Kuwabara says that, with enough funding, his ectogenetic chamber could be ready to use on a human fetus within five years. \n \n Roe vs. Wade is predicated on two basic ideas: a woman's right to privacy (including the right not to be pregnant) and the viability of the fetus -- defined as the ability to survive outside the mother's womb, currently placed at 24 weeks of gestation. \n \n Complete ectogenesis could dismantle both of these premises. First, it could make Roe's viability issue moot because with ectogenesis a fetus could be technically viable outside the mother's womb from the moment of conception. \n \n That would surely impact the other idea underpinning Roe: a woman's right to privacy. With ectogenesis, an unwanted fetus, rather than being aborted, could be removed from a woman and placed in an ectogenetic chamber to be adopted later. The woman's right to privacy would arguably not be invaded because removing the fetus to implant in an artificial womb need not be any more invasive than the abortion she was originally seeking. \n \n As bioethicists Peter Singer and Deane Wells write of ectogenesis in their book \"Making Babies: The New Science and Ethics of Conception\" (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1985), \"Freedom to choose what is to happen to one's body is one thing; freedom to insist on the death of a being that is capable of living outside of one's body is another.\" \n \n The pro-choice movement is ignoring the prospect of ectogenesis at its own peril. If and when ectogenesis becomes a reality, it will redefine the abortion debate. \n \n Just consider the issue of viability: 41 states ban abortion after viability. If ectogenesis is achieved, will abortion become illegal in each of those states? Many pro-lifers will certainly be prepared to argue yes. Isn't it about time pro-choicers start thinking of what they will say in response? \n \n Sacha Zimmerman writes for the New Republic, where a version of this article first appeared. \n \n \n Here's the full article:\n \n http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/08/24/IN273768.DTL\n \n or google \"artificial womb's\", you'll find plenty of news articles on the subject.",

   "I support women's choice; to do with their bodies as they please. I'm not walking around town carrying signs that say \"Have an abortion, they're great!\" or \"Everyone should have an abortion!\" or \"Choose abortion! It's the best choice!\"\n \n I support women's choice; no matter what that might be. People can make their own personal decisions without my involvement. Friends can come to me, and I'll support their decisions, even if I don't agree with it.\n\n \n Oh, I get it now. I though when you said \"pro-choice\" you meant the choice to have an abortion. I see now.\n \n \n(You said \"Huh\" to my question; \"how did you get out of school?\") I meant, really, how did you get out of going to school, you lucky bug? :) \n\n \n I do homeschool work. I do study math, english, science ect. My Mom chose to do homeschooling because of personal reasons.\n \n \nI don't think you understand what it means to be pro-choice. You're pushing your morals on the masses. I'm want people to choose their morals. If I was pushing my views, I would be telling people to get an abortion, like you're telling people not to. Instead, I'm encouraging society to allow people to make their own decisions. Does that make sense? It's been a long day. \n\n \n Allowing people to make their own decisions is fine. That I agree with. I guess I have a better understanding now of how the pro-choice person is.\n \n But I still hold my belief that morals play a part in this issue, whether it's constitutional or not.

   "That is correct. I wouldn't want anyone else's religion dominating my legal life either. Morals are different, obviously. But you are right, morals often stem from religious beliefs, but particular religion influencing a law shouldn't be allowed.\n\n Morals can be inspired by religious belief, but I would think that those morals that are inspired by religious religious belief fall in at least two general categories:\n \n 1) Morals that would still be held even if the person didn't hold those religious beliefs. For example, morals against killing other innocent people hold across almost all segments of humanity. You don't need to believe in God or any supernatural existence to feel that killing innocents is wrong. I have no problem with these types of morals playing a role in the decisions of legislators. As long as there is objective non-religious reasoning behind a particular moral stance, then I would not have major objections in its being considered.\n \n 2) Morals that are specific to a particular religion. For example, the requirement of some religions not to eat pork. I would not condone any law that says \"You are not allowed to eat pork because our religion tells us we can't\". There has to be some general reason - ex. I heard that such religious restrictions were put in place to begin with since pork quickly went bad and made people ill. It would be similar to our laws against injesting certain harmful drugs. Where abortion-law is concerned, I would say that a law that says that \"Newly fertilized eggs should not be aborted since certain sects of Christianity believe that the soul enters upon conception\" would be an imposition of a religious position, and would thus be against the constitution. On the other hand, if one makes a law that says \"We value a newly fertilized egg enough to protect it by law since it has the potential of becoming a person\" - that is a more general judgement call which, though I disagree with it, would still be a valid arguement to present.",

   "I'm frist trying to see if you believe absolutes exists...if not, then what good would a proof do when you don't believe in them?\n\n No, I don't think that an absolute ethical system exists. I believe that there are trends in human nature that lead to certain ethical stances (ex. against murder of innocents) that are general to a large percentage of the world's population, but the specifics of an ethical system depend on both people's assumptions about their world and the goals that they cherish. THis can lead to a fairly wide range of valid ethical systems. People have their own preferences, as you do and I do, but that does not make those stances absolute.\n \n As for my asking you for proof, as I said before, I did not ask you for proof because I believe an absolute ethical system exist. I asked you for proof to show that your arguement was false - i.e. your arguement that your ethical system is not purely opinion. I knew perfectly well that you had no evidence of an absolute ethical system. How do I know that? Because there is no absolute ethical system - no one has ever come up with an arguement with evidence which supports just one.\n \nI think it is more straight forward than what you think it is. \n\n As for the issues of the constitution, you take a literal reading of the constitution, as do some justices. Other justices do not take a literal reading. Historically, the interpretations have been more mixed than you think. Anyway, the leading interpretations of the constitution unfortunately seem more determined by politics than by substance. I would not be too optimistic if I were you about possible changes to the laws of this country based on the religious right stance of Bush and other neocons. The only reason he won is that he was able to convince the vast stretch of moderates in this country that he was not dangerously extreme and that he was perceived (wrongly in my opinion) as being better at keeping terrorism at bay. If religious right stances start to become law, the Neocons will loose their power VERY quickly.\n As it is, Bush's popularity rating is only at 32% - the tide is turning :)",
