   "the \"Religious Right\" are today's modern Pharisees. far from representing the teaching of Christ, today's \"Religious Right\" has created a \"Christian Coalition\" with the rich and the powerful TO OPPOSE Christ's message of love, concern, inclusion, compassion and social justice, just as their Pharisee predecessors did two thousand years ago.\n the \"Religious Right\" is composed of multi-millionares. here is what Jesus said about this:\n \n \"If you want to be perfect, go and sell everything you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.\" But when the young man heard this, he went away sadly, for he was very rich. \n \n these are the very words of Christ. Jesus would have supported a progressive tax if He were on Earth today, along with an increase tax on the rich in order to pay for more programs for the poor.\n \n People who imagine that Jesus of Nazareth is, was, or ever would be a \"Conservative\", need to take another hard look at the Gospels, which portray Jesus as one of the most Liberal religious leaders who ever lived.

Your own quotation is advocating a personal change. It is trying to teach people to step forward of their own free will, from their own compassion, from their own love for the poor. Jesus was trying to instill a sense of personal responsibility in each person to step forward and do the ethical and moral duty. It is a challenge to each one of us to live up to be \"perfect\". It is a challenge that people like Mother Teresa have accepted. If we were all more like her there would be no poverty. All without a government agency to collect taxes. Mother Teresa met that challenge without ever raising taxes.\n \n I don't belive Jesus ever asked the Romans to increase taxes to help the poor. Nor did he adovcate a scheme of collection and dispersion of funds. Just like today as it was 2000 years ago. Taxes just produce more opressive Romans who live of the backs of the tax payers. By advocating a stronger socialist government, you play the modern day equilivant of the Romans.",

Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' The wind blows wherever it pleases.

And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\n \n Those who have repented and asked for forgiveness are righteous. Now read part of Matthew 25:\n \n \"Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?' \"The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.' \"\n \n The RIGHTEOUS will inherit the kingdom of heaven because they believed that Christ was who He said He was and they treated Him like royalty. The unrighteous did not believe therfore they did not treat Him well.\n \n \"Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.\"\n \n \nSince that's not what Matthew says I guess I was right. You just make it up to suit yourselfas you go along.\n\n \n Read the definition of righteous then read Matthew 25 again. Try studying the Bible before you make blatant claims about its \"contradictions\".",

   "Well Calli,\n \nIf I named my sources you would have a temper tantrum at the first creationist source that I named.\n\n No. I would just know that you don't have an open mind on the issue. I have already shown on several occasions that your sources are wrong. You seem to agree since you routinely fail to answer.\n \nI also fail to see why you define \"detailed study\" as a college course.\n\n Because I seriously doubt that you can do a detailed study of the topic without any study at post secondary level. It is possible, but I doubt, from the knowledge that you have displayed of the topic, that you have accomplished it. I seem to be correct in that you have abandoned those threads, apparently because I have asked for knowledge that you don't have. If your study had been \"detailed\", then you would have had answers for those elementry questions. Additionally, it is impossible to do a detailed study of evolutionary theory from creationist sources - the texts don't exist.\n \nHave you taken any courses on the Bible?\n\n Yes. In college, as a matter of fact. My teacher was a remarkable man with a PhD who could place the events of the Bible in relation to history and each other. He was also able to discuss the meaning from the original Hebrew and Greek.\n \nHave you ever even read the Bible? (Other than Matthew 25)\n\n Yes. All of it - cover to cover, most of it several times and much of it in three languages.\n \n How about you? Have you read Futuyma's Evolutionary Biology? Or perhaps, Mayr's What Evolution Is?. Probably not Dawkins' River Out of Eden. Maybe The Theory of Evolution by John Maynard Smith.\n \n And I seriously doubt that your detailed study included such a detailed (1464 pages) treatment of the subject as Gould's The Structure of Evolutionary Theory. Actually, I'm still working on the last.\n \n I have also read some books by Henry Morris and I often read the Impact articles from the ICR site. I read transcripts of debates from Gish and others. I read most of the stuff posted at AIG by Sarfati, Ham, Weiland and others, and I have read Walt Brown's book, In the Beginning. I have listened to Kent Hovind's seminars (all 16 hours - it took a week) and I have visited the Creation Evidences Museum in Glen Rose, Texas and listened to a lecture by Carl Baugh. All of them are wrong about what they tell you about evolutionary theory - some of them are liars.\n \n So what books/papers/journals have you read that are part of your detailed, open minded study? If your detailed study of evolutionary included anything by any of the above, you have not studied evolutionary theory. It seems to me that an open mind would require reading what evolutionary theorists actually say.\n \n So are you going to come back to the other forum and discuss it or are you going to show that I am correct - that you have a closed mind - and stay away?",
