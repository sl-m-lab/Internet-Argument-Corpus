   "NASA has come back with the root cause of the space shuttle disaster. Guest what? It is not the foam. The root cause of the disaster was the NASA culture and management decision process. Yes the foam damaged the tile, but it was not the root cause.\n \n What has this got to do with guns? The root cause of crime/murder/etc is:\n \n 1) Family instability\n 2) Lack of education/economic opportunity\n 3) Drugs and hopelessness\n 4) Society acceptance of violence/media violence\n 5) In essence, social ills.\n \n NOT GUNS. Then why ban them? Please before responding, let me know you understand the meaning of root cause. Guns are as much the root cause of crime as pink plastic flamingos cause weeds in a yard. They are associated, but not the root cause. Guns are at crime scenes the same way weeds and pink plastic flamingos are on lawns.\n \n Gun control does absolutely nothing to address any of the above. If guns cause people to commit crime, then mine are all broke. Yes there are criminals with guns. I bear absolutely none of the responsibility for every criminal that commits a crime with a gun. If that is the case then I am partly responsible for the success of every doctor and lawyer. It was me that caused a doctor to study hard, work hard, and be successful. It must go both ways. It does not.",

As long as we live in an imperfect society gun-control is necessary in the interest of public safety.

Then you have gun control and crime control in one sweep without trampling all over the Const and the rights of good citizens.\n \n Again I'm the first in line to vote for gun control when it does not change, affect, modify, and engineer the behavior of good citizens.\n \n Don't you get it? Gun control as it stands is fundamentally wrong because it changes, affects, modifies, and engineers the behavior of good citizens. You don't need gun control in Beverly Hills are any other place with wealthy people they don't have: broken families, lack of education/economic opportunity, drugs and hoplessness, acceptance of violent behavior to same degree where there is large amounts of crime and gun crime. Stable, educated, and economically good neighborhoods have gun control and crime control, WITHOUT ANY RESTICTIVE ANTI 2nd AMEND LAWS. Such places are NOT UTOPIA. They control guns and violence by just simply being and doing thier own private business without nosy anti-gunners.\n \n I have laid it out for you. That is how you reduce crime and gun crime together. What is your plan? BTW gun control only addresses gun crime.\n \n Let me ask you this too. Do you undertand how the space shuttle was destroyed?

The law is very clear on this issue. You use deadly force only in response to deadly force. Only if you feel your life is in danger at the moment. In some states you must retreat to saftey until there is no longer any safe place. Then you use deadly force.
