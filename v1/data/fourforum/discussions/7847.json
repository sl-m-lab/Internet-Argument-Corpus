But, these kids do not take their acedemics seriously,and when they are failing, teachers and parents come to me about it. I can't do much. What should be done about kids like this?\n\n \n I think you are trapped in the system. First let me start off by asking you a question. Why do you want kids to get good grades? Do you care if your kids can pass tests if they know the material? I think the problem is there's too much of an emphasis on grades. Kids aren't stupid, they don't see the point in the whole studying thing and memorizing stuff just so they can get A's. I tend to try to learn what I can, and I get A's and B's (3.84 GPA currently) but that's not my focus. My focus is to learn, and if I don't get an A because I don't study enough for a test oh well. Other kids give up. They get a bad grade or something and think \"I'll never do well in school, why not enjoy life now and f*** school?\". These are the people you should be targeting, they are the ones that can be changed. The last group can never be helped and that's the group that truly don't care about anything but having fun now, and may drink, do drugs, skip school, etc. just for fun. These are the kids that need to help themselves before you can help them.\n \n Right now the majority of my homework is busywork. This is one thing that needs to change. I have already mentioned but another is the emphasis on tests. Instead of tests being a measure of what you know and how well the teacher has taught the subject, it has turned into the only reason for learning. Teachers teach to the tests and that takes away any love of learning left. No kid will say it, but everyone loves to learn. We need to fall back on teaching without emphasis on grades and tests. The people who skipped, smoked, etc. will probably still do that, but the other kids may be more inclined to actually pay attention in class. Learning is its own reward, and while I believe there should be homework for practice, I think it should be optional. I actually had a debate (not a formal one, just on the school discussion forum for that class) on the amount of busywork. I literally did all 30 problems in like 2 lines each online showing how much homework it was and how little actual thinking it involved. The response was \"you may not need the practice but others do\". Maybe that is true, but why should I have to do stuff that I'm already comfortable with? There's other stuff I may need work on but the other kids don't. I'm the student, and I should be able to know what I need work on.\n \n But basically, being a high school principal, you don't have a lot of options because of the nature of public schools (and I'm sure the parents would go crazy if you suggested half the things I've said here :)).\n \n BUT... something you can do now: You are talking about getting good grades, getting into a good college, getting a good job, etc. How about emphasizing on the learning now? Most kids think that it's forever before they'll get a job, and it's human nature to want to have fun now. Don't do good in school to get into a good college, do it for yourself. Other than that currently if kids don't want to pay attention, that only hurts them. If there are a lot of questions about certain teachers, maybe you should look into the teachers. If it's the same students with many teachers there's not much you can do about it. The parents should be more involved, not you. The parents should contact the teachers (you could encourage them to) to see what's going on in class. But if a kid doesn't care about school, there's not much you can currently do to make him/her suddenly care about it. That's something only the parents can do, and sometimes not even them. It's only hurting them though, it's amazing how much parenting parents want the schools to do. No wonder there are so many rules.\n \n You said it yourself, \"you can't do much\". Just continue to encourage your students to learn, and encourage the parents and teachers to talk. Otherwise, that's about all you can do.",

I'll assume you're a principal mainly because this seems to be what most principals would say.\n \n And I hate it. The only purpose of these kids' educations is so they don't have to work at Burger King? Why not teach them about jobs and train them to work starting in high school. You seem to think that if you take school seriously, you will have a good life, but if you don't you will work at minimum wage. Is the point of school to learn or pass? This is the fundamental question. Unfortunately you as well as most other principals/teachers seem to think the latter. Again I'd rather start out at Burger King and rise up than start off at a high-paying job before they realize I didn't really learn anything at school. Good grades will get you in the door, but getting a good education, which contrary to popular belief is not directly tied to grades, is infinitely more important than good grades. In a good class the grades and how much you learn are probably tied together, but I can't stand classes that assign a ton of busywork as homework (like the stuff I'm procrastinating from now. Oh well there's always lunch). This is also the root of the cheating problem. When there's work and no real reason to do it, why not copy? It's not like you're learning anything from busywork, why not make it take less time by cheating? \n \n Whenever anyone (mostly teachers) ask me what I would do about the cheating \"problem\" I say that I would stop assigning busywork and stop grading homework. If it is truly used as learning re-inforcement, it is to the benefit of the child to do it, and they shouldn't need a grade for it. If it's not to their benefit, they won't do it. But most teachers care more for grades than whether their kids learn it or not. Nothing new here. And of course we can't have any work that isn't graded, then they may not do it. Oh horrors. Seriously, until you, other principals, and teachers realize that kids don't learn well when you give them exactly what they will learn, when, the exact text they will use, no freedom of curriculum, and simply assign them busywork, you will experience kids that don't care. And even most of the kids who seem to care are only doing it for the grade because their parents are obsesed with grades (don't mean to be racist, but many Asians fit this stereotype). I've gotten to the point where I do legitimate homework first (essays, stuff I may not understand, etc.), then the busywork XXXX. I go to sleep at around 11, regardless of if my busywork is done. This year's been great, because I get little busywork, but I have a little today. Oh well, it's 11 now. Time to go to bed. Bed's more important than busywork. Like I said there's always lunch.",

That was my way of expressing the jobs they MIGHT end up with. But, you are right, and that is what I meant. You were also right about good grades getting your foot in the door. Yes, and that is also what I meant. See, some colleges if not all, expect you to have above a 2.0 GPA and some of these kids that don't even try, end up with a low 1.0 or lower. \n For example, I used to have a student in my office regularly for not turning in work, and always being a little thorn in my rose bush. He tells me he wants to be a doctor and sometimes he tells me he wants to be a biochemist. He is a good kid, just addicted to the darn video games and sometimes has trouble turing in his assignments. So, I made it clear that those people that have those jobs have to be able to do math, and also have to be good in science, health, and so on. Mainly the classes he fails. So, after that, he was put in a learning center, somewhat similar to Johns ARC, and he was raising his GPA and his acedemic studies got him to a C-B average.\n Also, that is interesting cheating suggestions and an interesting thing on the learning. Zack, I have a question for you, are you a adult posing as a kid? You are a smart kid. One hell of a smart kid. Sometimes I think you are an adult. But, thanks for making my point. \n \n \n \"Education is the way to your future, don't waste it, use it,\"-My own personal quote.",

If you approach it from \"I want them to get good grades\" they won't want to learn. If you try to make learning fun and interesting and relevant to life, giving kids more freedom to explore different topics within the topic being covered, they will be motivated to learn and when they learn most likely their GPA will rise.\n \n \n \n \n\n For example, I used to have a student in my office regularly for not turning in work, and always being a little thorn in my rose bush.

So, I made it clear that those people that have those jobs have to be able to do math, and also have to be good in science, health, and so on.

Does he just not like the math classes and science classes? Does he just not think the homework is worth doing?\n \n \n \n \n\n So, after that, he was put in a learning center, somewhat similar to Johns ARC, and he was raising his GPA and his acedemic studies got him to a C-B average.\n \n\n Again, I don't know him so I don't know much about him.

But I'm pretty sure most people who've read my posts realize that I'm a kid. Do you really think an adult would realize the problem with the emphasis on grades? I didn't exactly make your point, I see my comments went over your head, maybe I didn't express it clearly or most likely you're just as brainwashed by standardized tests and grades as every other teacher and principal. I'm tired of grades being used as the objective. I'm tired of only learning something because it will be on the test (why is the question \"will this be on the test?\" ever asked?). I'm tired of teachers assuming that if they don't do work their way and complete all their stupid busywork we won't learn it at all. I've had 2 teachers all the way through public schools who seemed to think otherwise (freshman physics and junior English, first semester). The teachers cared more about if we learned it than if we memorized the formulas, and I think in terms of English my writing has gotten a ton better because of this particular teacher. Whenever I went up to my other English teacher's about my writing, the first thing they would say was \"the grade's final, I'm not changing it\". I didn't care about my grade, I cared about learning to write. I've had trouble writing and although I think I do fine writing opinion stuff such as on this forum, but structured writing has always been hard for me, and I'm sick and tired of teachers thinking that all I want is a better grade. If I come out of English with a C as a better writer, it tops by far if I came out with an A with my writing as it was before. That's just my opinion.\n \n \n By the way:\n no one knows who's who on the internet, which is why I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, because it doesn't hurt me a bit even if you really are someone else to assume you're who you say you are. I'm here to debate, and even if you're completely making who you are up, you are using many of the arguments I could see real principals using, so it fits my purposes just as well. So until you prove otherwise, I'll assume you're not lying.\n \n \n\n \"Education is the way to your future, don't waste it, use it,\"-My own personal quote.\n\n Pretty good quote, we get a free education, and it's too bad that some people choose to waste it. But as I said, when kids see school as pointless and boring, some are going to decide not to care, and that's when they waste it.",

Does your school have after school activities? I know that after school activities were what kept many (like myself) with decent grades in high school. Mostly because it's grades that allow the students to stay in those activities. Now by after school activities, I mean more than just sports. I for a fact know that there are plenty of students that wouldn't get involved in after school activities if they were only sports. I'm talking drama, yearbook/newspaper, various clubs and activities. If students have something they can get involved with and have fun in, their grades could improve because they would have something to make an effort for. Does your school have those kinds of activities? If not, it really should. Something should be brought up to the school board if there are no activities. If they complain about the budget, tell them \"SCREW THE BUDGET, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CHILDREN'S POTENTIAL HERE!\"\n \n But then again, I'm real big on having after school activities.",

Student must choose favorite subject at the beginning of year and complete (under faculty supervision) one 15-20 page \"mini thesis\", properly sourced, by the end of the year.\n \n This sort of approach would:\n \n -Foster critical thinking skills.\n \n -Promote good academic writing, as well as public speaking skills.\n \n -Reduce the overall ammount of homework per week in most cases.\n \n -Force students at all points to reason ABOUT the material, rather than just memorise it.\n \n -Allow cleverer students to \"show off\" their accumen, which will give them reason to take interest in a course no matter how easily it comes to them. These students will also not become disillusioned by having to spend more time on busywork than is necessary to gain understanding.\n \n Who can blame modern students from holding high schools in contempt? Clueless teachers are more trained in \"education theory\" than in their subject. They teach just-so stories instead of knowlege and don't know anything except whats in the book. Endless 'dittoes' and mutiple-choice tests incentivise rote memorization over comprehension. The only carrot held up at the end of this four years of drudgery is the opportunity to do at least four more years of school, and one day maybe earn a degree so they can be middle class like their overworked, uninspired, probabally divorced, and usually dissillusioned parents.",

   "Guys, as a principal, I have a daily problem. Kids.\n Some kids are so stuck up in life, have to much free time, constantly talk to friends, never use their school time wisely. What is coming of all this?\n Our school has about a hundred teachers that are striving to see and make achievment, inteligence, and everything they are going to need for the real future is in their little craniums. We want our kids to pass with decent grades. We want them to get into a good college and maybe get a decent life out of this.\n But some kids come to school and jerk off with their friends, don't do their homework, don't study, don't take their acedemics seriously, and find school a place to goof off and destroy.\n They must think that I am bluffing. I have said many times on announcements that they need to take their acedemic work seriously and study and get good greats cause if they don't get decent grades, they will most likely not get into a good college and have a decent life.\n I want to see kids get good grades, and be somebody. But, these kids do not take their acedemics seriously,and when they are failing, teachers and parents come to me about it. I can't do much. What should be done about kids like this?\n\n I have my own opinion about whether you are or are not a past poster in new clothing, but that's irrelevant. On the other hand, I think it is pretty obvious you are either a)not a school principal, or b)the most poorly educated school principal ever. Your spelling, syntax, general writing skills, and ways of discussing what you are trying to say show it. If you have a particular belief about education go ahead and tell us, but please don't lie about who you are to make your argument appear more legitimate. \n \n By the way, I just recently went to Rapid City and the Black Hills area generally. I loved it up there.",

   "Ok, I see what you mean. I broadly agree, I tend to treat multiple choice with some suspicion (though it can be successful when done well, but it's quite tricky to set it up well). I've a little experience marking UK Key Stage 3 (14 year olds) exam papers, specifically maths, and the questions here are largely as you'd like them to be, allowing for different methods, allowing partial marks for partially correct reasoning, that sort of thing. I don't think it adds that much to learning though, as teachers will still be tempted to teach to the test in order to get the best grades. The other problem is that the longer sort of question you suggest tends to have rather binary results. You will get a minority of kids who can do that question, martialing all the knowledge together, but the majority will not have a clue where to start. If you want to get a good spread of the range of abilities in a group, you use multi-part questions, beginning with basic 1 mark single word answer questions and moving on to longer calculations or explanations with the final part requiring some deductive reasoning and logic followed by a calculation or explanation of reasons for an answer. Requiring science students to write essay questions seems a little unfair. There are plenty of people who will be very good at the careers good marks in science lead to but aren't confident with extended writing. If employers want ability in extended writing they can ask for English or History qualifications.",

   "Well, then the smarter way to \"teach to the test\" is to teach the skills of organising and integrating knowlege in order to be able to tackle this sort of problem.\n \n High school students DO NOT need to learn that much information, they need to learn how to take in information and generate useful meaning. The US model of education fails on all levels because we do not teach reasoning and problem solving, we do not encourage academics as a theatre of creative intellectual effort. Instead, we teach a series of \"facts\" as if memorising the encyclopedia and almanac were the height of intellectual accomplishment. You can always look up a fact, what education should give you is the power to frame a question and know what data to gather and how to fit that data into a useful whole.",
