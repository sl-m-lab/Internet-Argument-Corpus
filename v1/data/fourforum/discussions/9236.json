   "White Supremacists? Where?\n \n The enemies of White people around the world have a pathological love affair with the term \"White supremacist\" whenever they report on or describe White people who act in a collective manner, no matter how benign, on behalf of their own group interests.\n \n Typically \"White supremacism\" is described as an ideology which holds that the White race is superior to other races. However, the same people who decry \"White supremacism\" seem to have a difficult time describing the actions of non-Whites acting on behalf of their group interests, often violently, as \"supremacists\" of any kind!\n \n All right then, I have a question for you about this \"White supremacism\": where is it? Where is this so-called White supremacism? Have you seen it?\n \n Far too many White people in America and around the world are race-mixing and aborting themselves out of existence. Our politicians are allowing record Third World immigration into our White ancestral homelands. Our White corporate \"free traders\" and White globalists continue to impoverish us as they send our jobs overseas, and our White politicians send our White soldiers to die in a senseless war in Iraq for Israel's benefit, soldiers who will never sire another generation of their own kind.\n \n When you hear these facts...does that sound like \"White supremacism\" to you?\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=8810\n \n Or listen:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/docs/audio/fr20060429.mp3\n \n \n \n .",

I mentioned an NAAWP and someone asked \"what, is that run by the KKK?\". How come it's acceptable to advance one race but not another? You can't have it both ways. I'm with you, I think the NAACP, Affirmative Action, and other programs designed to elevate blacks and minorities are simply making the problem worse. If this were a fight for equality, everyone would be with them, and people like the OP would be exposed for the racists they really are. But as of now it's given them an excuse to be racist and claim \"they're doing the same thing\", and the sad thing is they're pretty much right.",

Of course the NAACP is not on the level of the KKK because they have not committed any acts of violence. But also consider this. You hear very often of politicians playing to the black vote, the hispanic vote, etc. What if a politician tried to get the white vote? They'd be called a racist. Why is it racist when you do the EXACT SAME thing, but with another race?\n \n And the NAACP does NOT want equality, they want to advance them as far as they can, unless I am mistaken. They are for Affirmative Action (simple discrimination), fight for \"black\" issues, whatever they would be, in politics. President Bush doesn't speak to the NAACP and he's ignoring the black vote. Steele here in Maryland almost won simply because he pulled a lot of the black vote. This all is simply racist, and is disgusting. You want equality, well actions speak louder than words. This is in generalities btw, I know a lot of specific people don't vote simply based on the color of the candidate's skin, but there are enough people that do to make a difference in elections, and that's just sad.",

In fact, we know all they really care about is popping out more kids to get a bigger welfare check. And black men don't have pools or patios. Black men are either gang members, drug dealers, drug addicts, pimps, wannabe rappers, or all of the above. And of course all black men are lousy fathers. Naturally, black people are not capable of owning or operating a business either. When I picture America, I try not to picture any black families. /sarcasm",

Black people don't have guns? All white males want to ban flag-burning? You're talking about the majority, but the real group is the group you name, not the race. I'm not talking about someone supporting Affirmative Action to get the black vote or someone for raising the minimum wage getting the black vote (again, a VERY stereotypical generality, much like you make above), I'm talking about actually running a black candidate to simply get the black vote. I guess you could argue since most politicians are white males that maybe whites vote mostly down racial lines too, but as women make up the majority and there becomes a greater and greater percentage of minorities, I doubt that more and more.\n \n Again, what about this simple fact?
