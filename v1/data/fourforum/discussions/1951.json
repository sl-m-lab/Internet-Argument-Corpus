   "There was a new election in Spain and the socialist party won. They now plan to pull out of Iraq. \n \n The terror attack in Spain hit right before the election and may have swayed the election, some say. It has been speculated that Al Qaeda attacked in order to change the government in Spain and hopefully get them out of Iraq. Do you think that this could have been their goal (If Al Qaeda is responsible)?\n \n If so, it appears Al Qaeda wants Westerners to stop meddling in the Middle East. Then there must be a purpose to Al Qaeda's attacks. There reason must go beyond just wanting to kill non-Muslims. \n \n Comments?",

   "One more point. I bet if they hit here in the US again, it would have the opposite effect and Bush would be re-elected. What do you think?\n \n Here is a link to a story:\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61727-2004Mar15.html\n \n The Spanish Response \n \n Tuesday, March 16, 2004; Page A20 \n \n \n SPANISH VOTERS no doubt wished to rebuke the ruling Popular Party for its wrong-footed reaction to last week's terrorist bombing in Madrid, and its support for the United States in Iraq. Fair enough -- but it's hard not to be concerned about how the message was likely received outside the country, by the leaders of al Qaeda and other Islamic terrorist organizations. \n \n Before the bombing, the Popular Party was favored to win comfortably; after the devastating attack, and an al Qaeda statement saying its intent was to punish Spain for its role in Iraq, the election was swept by the opposition -- and its leader immediately pledged to withdraw Spanish troops and cool relations with Washington. The rash response by Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister-elect, will probably convince the extremists that their attempt to sway Spanish policy with mass murder succeeded brilliantly. ...",

   "This is most certainly an aggressive rebuttal to Spain's involvement in the Iraqi War. It's definitely not Eta, because they've never been hesitant to stake claim to involvement in any large-scale terror attacks. I'm guessing this is al-Qaeda, directly, or a constituent or compatriot of the al-Qaeda network. Really, it's not a bad move. For the most part, this war has been completed, and our vague goals have been consummated, I suppose. Spain's involvement was fairly minimal, right? They'll still reap some of the advantages from their involvement in this travesty of a war, regardless of whether their cowardice dictates their actions. Really, I'd just pull out and spare the citizens. America's concrete enough to complete this war, and the bulk of the coalition wasn't Spanish, right?",

In britain they bombed and used terror tactics against the british. They never targeted any other country, just britain and british interests, why? Because britain was there enemy.\n \n Al qaedas enemy is the U.S, for obvious reasons, hence airplanes into side of tall buildings, in other words its a U.S Al qaeda war, if you wanna call it that. Spain had nothing to do with it, why spain got involved, only asnar knows, same with britain aswell, global recognition, U.S favours, whatever the reason. Now al qaeda, sees spain as the enemy, where as before spain was just another country, thats why spain was targeted.\n \n Now if spain got involved in britains war against the IRA, then the IRA would have targetted spain. I dont see ETA targeting australia, or poland, unless those countries tartget ETA, do you see the point im trying to make?",

   "I guess the point is that many people said that the only reason al Qaeda hit us on 9-11 was because we were non-Muslim. According to OBL we were hit because we gave money and weapons to Israel and we stationed troops in Saudi Arabia. \n \n I suggest that these terrorists have specific reasons for attacking us or anyone else, just like the abortion clinic bombers did. I am not saying that it is wholly our fault or Spain's fault that we were attacked. What I am saying is that there are consequences to our actions, and these terrorists don't just run around killing people because they are non-Muslim necessarily.",
