You do not have to be a member of MCC, or of any church, in order to receive. Every person has the right to come to what we believe is God's Table - not MCC's table, not the Pastor's table, but God's Table - and YOU have a place at that Table!\n\n \n I also love their misson statement \n \n \nMISSION STATEMENT \n \n \"The Metropolitan Community Church of Windsor is a Christ-Centered community providing opportunities to experience the freedom of God's unconditional love through inspirational worship, outreach, spiritual growth, and education so that all may become the completed portrait that God envisions.\"\n\n \n \n Other than the MCC does anyone else know of a GLBT affirming church?

   "Depends on your view of God, to me he is a loving father and I am his glorious creation. Created and given many very special gifts, among them is my gayness. It is His great gift and blessing to me.\n \n God to you is this angry Vengeful creature that has to be feared and obeyed or he will kill you. And you wonder why people are driven away from modern churches in droves.\n\n Matthew,\n God is a loving father and you are one of his glorious creations. However, homosexual behavior is not a gift from God but rather a contradiction of God's gift. Any church that does not let you know this is doing you a disservice. \"God has given us free will and thus the power to do whatever we want with our bodies. But he has not given us the freedom to determine whether what we do with our bodies is good or evil.\" God has given us the gift of life and the gift to partner with him in creating and conveying life. Homosexual relationships resist this gift and they resist the true self-gift that should be present in a loving relationship as explained below.\n \n \n\"A man's body doesn't make sense by itself (or in a loving, sexual relationship with another man). Nor does a woman's body make sense by itself. But seen in light of each other, sexual difference (and complementarity) reveals the unmistakable plan of God that man and woman are meant to be a gift to one another. 'Man becomes the image of God not so much in the moment of solitude as in the moment of communion.'\" When he says as Jesus did, 'This is my body given up for you.'\n \n The body is a 'sacrament'--a sign that makes visible the invisible mystery of God. God's mystery is revealed in human flesh--there is a theology in our very bodies!\" Because the body is a sacrament revealing God's mystery, its actions in love and sex must be principled on God's love. God's love is free, total, faithful, and fruitful. Homosexual love does not meet those criteria (it is not total or fruitful and often not faithful--and the same thing can be said about heterosexual \"love\" that participates in contraception and ends in divorce). There is never that attempt in homosexual love to share that very inner essence of oneself in creating the couple's love in a child--there is never that attempt to embody their love in a concrete physical manifestation that is a child--there is never that complete self-donation of one's entire self including his fertility. Thus the love of homosexuals is not fruitful or total. \n \n The Trinity is an eternal 'communion of persons.' The Father eternally \"begets\" the Son by giving himself to and for the Son. In turn, the Son eternally receives the love of the Father and eternally gives himself back to the Father. The love they share is the Holy Spirit who, as we say in the Nicene Creed, 'proceeds [eternally] from the Father and the Son. \n \n And here's why we exist: Love, by its nature, desires to expand its own communion. God certainly didn't need anyone else. The love of the Trinity is perfect and complete in itself. Yet out of sheer goodness and generosity, God wanted to create a great multitude of other persons to share in his own eternal, ecstatic 'exchange of love.'\n \n God created us male and female so that we could image his love by becoming a sincere gift to each other. This sincere giving establishes a 'communion of persons' not only between the sexes but also--in the normal course of events--with a 'third' who proceeds from them both. In this way, sexual love becomes an icon or earthly image in some sense of the inner life of the Trinity. \n \n In addition to imaging the Trinity, sexual love is also meant to image the union of God with humanity. Christ's redeeming self-donation is a new outpouring of the Trinity's love on all of creation. The Church receives this love and attempts to reciprocate it. God endowed our bodies as male and female with the sacramental ability to convey this exchange between Christ and the Church. As St. Paul says, quoting from Genesis, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This is a great mystery, and I mean in reference to Christ and the church.\" (Ephesians 5:31-23). This tells us how profound and important and sacred sexual intercourse is and that it is purposeful beyond only pleasure in the Christian context. Paul tells us in Ephesians that the physical union of man and wife as one body is a foretaste of man's union with God. The marriage of man and woman is a foretaste of heaven, a foretaste of the marriage of the Lamb, the union of Christ and His Church-perhaps this is why we are driven so strongly to experience sex. But a marriage of man and man is an impossibility. It cannot conform to the self-donation or fruitfulness or totality that is required of God's love in imaging the Trinity or the Marriage of the Lamb. \n\n (Most of the above is a direct quote from Christopher West's Theology of Body for Beginner's where he explains Pope John Paul II's series of Wednesday Audiences entitled The Theology of the Body. The parts in italics are paraphrases by me of parts of the book or parts of Mr. West's public speaking appearances).\n \n In regards to the church you have found offering \"communion\" to everyone, you must consider that the churches that deny the Eucharist to some often do not have a motive to exclude people but rather to protect them. What does communion mean? Common union. If one is in a persistent state of unrepentant sin then they are denying their union with God. Often the witholding of the sacrament is not a \"denial\" of the Eucharist by the church but a denial of the person involved to repent of sin. This position goes back to the scripture 1 Corinthians 11:27-32, \"Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.But if we judged ourselves truly, we should not be judged. But when we are judged by the Lord, we are chastened so that we may not be condemned along with the world.\"\n \n Peace",

   "To all concerning the debate on the \"Apocrypha\" or the \"Deuterocanonicals\":\n \n From James Akin's website, www.jamesakin.com\n \n \"Who Compiled the Old Testament?\n \n The Church does not deny that there are ancient writings which are \"apocryphal.\" During the early Christian era, there were scores of manuscripts which purported to be Holy Scripture but were not. Many have survived to the present day, like the Apocalypse of Peter and the Gospel of Thomas, which all Christian churches regard as spurious writings that don't belong in Scripture.\n During the first century, the Jews disagreed as to what constituted the canon of Scripture. In fact, there were a large number of different canons in use, including the growing canon used by Christians. In order to combat the spreading Christian cult, rabbis met at the city of Jamnia or Javneh in A.D. 90 to determine which books were truly the Word of God. They pronounced many books, including the Gospels, to be unfit as scriptures. This canon also excluded seven books (Baruch, Sirach, 1 and 2 Maccabees, Tobit, Judith, and the Wisdom of Solomon, plus portions of Esther and Daniel) that Christians considered part of the Old Testament.\n The group of Jews which met at Javneh became the dominant group for later Jewish history, and today most Jews accept the canon of Javneh. However, some Jews, such as those from Ethiopia, follow a different canon which is identical to the Catholic Old Testament and includes the seven deuterocanonical books (cf. Encyclopedia Judaica, vol. 6, p. 1147).\n Needless to say, the Church disregarded the results of Javneh. First, a Jewish council after the time of Christ is not binding on the followers of Christ. Second, Javneh rejected precisely those documents which are foundational for the Christian Church -- the Gospels and the other documents of the New Testament. Third, by rejecting the deuterocanonicals, Javneh rejected books which had been used by Jesus and the apostles and which were in the edition of the Bible that the apostles used in everyday life -- the Septuagint.\n \n The Apostles & the Deuteros\n The Christian acceptance of the deuterocanonical books was logical because the deuterocanonicals were also included in the Septuagint, the Greek edition of the Old Testament which the apostles used to evangelize the world. Two thirds of the Old Testament quotations in the New are from the Septuagint. Yet the apostles nowhere told their converts to avoid seven books of it. Like the Jews all over the world who used the Septuagint, the early Christians accepted the books they found in it. They knew that the apostles would not mislead them and endanger their souls by putting false scriptures in their hands -- especially without warning them against them.\n But the apostles did not merely place the deuterocanonicals in the hands of their converts as part of the Septuagint. They regularly referred to the deuterocanonicals in their writings. For example, Hebrews 11  encourages us to emulate the heroes of the Old Testament and in the Old Testament \"Women received their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, that they might rise again to a better life\" (Heb. 11:35).\n There are a couple of examples of women receiving back their dead by resurrection in the Protestant Old Testament. You can find Elijah raising the son of the widow of Zarepheth in 1 Kings 17, and you can find his successor Elisha raising the son of the Shunammite woman in 2 Kings 4, but one thing you can never find -- anywhere in the Protestant Old Testament, from front to back, from Genesis to Malachi -- is someone being tortured and refusing to accept release for the sake of a better resurrection. If you want to find that, you have to look in the Catholic Old Testament -- in the deuterocanonical books Martin Luther cut out of his Bible.\n Hebrews 11:35 is an indisputable reference to 2 Maccabees 7, but many are not so clear as there may be only a single phrase that echoes one in a deuterocanonical book (and this may not be obvious in the translation, but only the original languages).  \n \n The story is found in 2 Maccabees 7, where we read that during the Maccabean persecution, \"It happened also that seven brothers and their mother were arrested and were being compelled by the king, under torture with whips and cords, to partake of unlawful swine's flesh. . . . but the brothers and their mother encouraged one another to die nobly, saying, 'The Lord God is watching over us and in truth has compassion on us . . . ' After the first brother had died . . . they brought forward the second for their sport. . . . he in turn underwent tortures as the first brother had done. And when he was at his last breath, he said, 'You accursed wretch, you dismiss us from this present life, but the King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life'\" (2 Macc. 7:1, 5-9).\n One by one the sons die, proclaiming that they will be vindicated in the resurrection. \"The mother was especially admirable and worthy of honorable memory. Though she saw her seven sons perish within a single day, she bore it with good courage because of her hope in the Lord. She encouraged each of them . . . [saying], 'I do not know how you came into being in my womb. It was not I who gave you life and breath, nor I who set in order the elements within each of you. Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the beginning of man and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves for the sake of his laws,'\" telling the last one, \"Do not fear this butcher, but prove worthy of your brothers. Accept death, so that in God's mercy I may get you back again with your brothers\" (2 Macc. 7:20-23, 29).\n This is but one example of the New Testaments' references to the deuterocanonicals. The early Christians were thus fully justified in recognizing these books as Scripture, for the apostles not only set them in their hands as part of the Bible they used to evangelize the world, but also referred to them in the New Testament itself, citing the things they record as examples to be emulated.\" \n \n See also the literary parallels between Wisdom and Paul's Letter to the Romans (Romans 1: 20-29 with Wisdom 13:5,8; 14:24, 27 and Romans 9:20-23 with Wisdom 12:12,20; 15:7) as well as Corinthians (compare 2 Corinthians 5:1-4 with Wisdom 9:15) The Letter of James contains allusions to Proverbs and Sirach (James 1:19 with Sirach 5:11; James 1:13 with Sirach15:11-12) (Unabridged Christianity by Father Mario P. Romero)",

   "Orion,\n \nExcept, perhaps, to keep them \"in their place\"? Kinda like those uppity women? I mean, didn't they read Paul? \n \n Where have I indicated this?\n \n \nDid you decide your own sexual orientation? I certainly didn't. I discovered that, at about age six, I enjoyed the company of girls. I didn't know why. \n \n I'm not sure if I did or didn't. But I make willful decisions all of the time to avoid sinful actions concerning my sexual life. Do you think that pedophilia is a sexual orientation that we have no control over? \n \n In your opinion, if our sexual orientation is predetermined somehow are our interactions with others in relationships outside of the sexual sphere also predetermined in certain ways? \n \n \nTraditional Christianity has a lot for which to apologize, not the least of which is its demonstrated reactionary attitude toward both science and ANE scholarship. \n \n Although Christianity may have much to apologize for (As John Paul II did) it also has a lot to be proud of. In fact, it was the seat of science and scholarship for ages.\n \n \nParanoia city. You can do better than this. \n \n However our sexual morality goes, so goes the family, so goes our society.\n \n \nAnd the source of those prohibitions? Written by men of a particular society of a particular age who were attempting to define the wishes/demands of their tribal god. \n \n How does this apply to one who is a Christian who professes acceptance of the authority of these men of a particular age in defining the demands of their tribal god? This debate started with Matthew S praising a Christian church for accepting homosexuality as okay. He is a self-professed Christian. He is not a secular atheist. So he is picking and choosing what's important in Christianity. He has no authority to do this. He believes in the men of a particular age defining wishes of their tribal god but just not about homosexuality.\n \n \nYes, in fact. We're also talking about bigotry and a rear-guard defensive movement put forth by conservative/fundamentalist Christians in defense of archaic, Bronze Age prohibitions. \n \n Again, Matthew S accepts many Bronze Age prohibitions. If we go more into the sphere of government versus religion then you may have a point. But I don't think that was the origin of this debate. \n \n \nHorrors!\n\n Yes. It is not a good thing to expose children and others to perversions. It shocks them, confuses them, and desensitizes them--just as much as the heterosexual parading on much of our TV, magazines, radios, and movies does.",

It is the 2,000 year position of Christianity taking into account Scripture, Holy Tradition, and the Teaching Authority of the Church that has remained consistent and constant throughout the ages since Christianity's inception. Homosexual behavior has always been considered a sinful act.\n\n \n Still only your opinion and the churches position sucks and is irrelivent in the 21st century. In other words you can stick the churches opinion where the sun doesn't shine.\n \n \n\n To the exclusion of all others? I thought you were working for acceptance and inclusion. You are the only one allowed to \"exclude?\" \n \n\n \n As I have stated before there is NOTHING more important then the well being of the GLBT community and its' people to the exclusion of all others if nessary.\n \n\n I sincerely hope you come to that balance. Know that Christians are not attempting to impose their values on GLBT people. Christians are simply stating the 2000 year position of Christianity. \n\n \n Yes they do they hate us they have put their religious views into law. It is called the Michigan marriage amendment. It was put on the ballot by christians, with petition signing sundays and your beloved catholic church gave this group 480,000$, http://www.protectmarriageyes.org/About.aspx and its target was to keep GLBT people from marring one another.

   "The wheelchair-bound paraplegic is well aware that there is 'something wrong' with him. As many gays on this forum have testified, they themselves feel that there is nothing whatsoever 'wrong' with their feelings for each other, either functionally or morally. For them it is the most natural thing in the world, and if you personally don't like it, then ignore it: don't presume to tell them you know better.\n \n As to your religious point, since the Judaeochristian god is generally represented as male, male-on-male affection would seem to image God's love at least as well as heterosexual intercourse, and arguably better.\n\n No, the Judaeo-Christian God would not be imaged by male-on-male affection. Would God make the ideal image of his love sterile or life-giving? (be fruitful and multiply and subdue the earth) Would God make the ideal action/transmission of his love one that will last or one that would be self-limiting/self-defeating? If God's image is more closely conveyed by man-on-man love then why did God bother to create women? Why didn't he stop at just man? \n \n God did not simply make man in his image but also woman. He made them both in his image. Genesis 1:27-28  \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female   he created them. And God blessed them, and God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it...\" \n \n And although God is represented by maleness throughout the Bible, he is also represented with feminine qualities. God is neither male nor female though he embodied us so here on earth for a purpose. God is not made in our image, we are made in His. God transcends the sexes. He is pure spirit.\n \n Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraph 370\n \"In no way is God in man's image. He is neither man nor woman. God is pure spirit in which there is no place for the difference between the sexes. But the respective \"perfections\" of man and woman reflect something of the infinite perfection of God: those of a mother and those of a father and husband.\"\n \n When I say that man-on-man doesn't work functionally, I mean that. The parts when put together don't work. A bolt doesn't screw into another bolt, it screws into a nut. A key doesn't work with another key, it fits into a lock. An antibody doesn't join with another antibody, it joins an antigen. Etc. Look at the male body then look at the female body. There is a purpose inscribed in the physical characteristics of each. They fit like lock and key. This is an important clue.\n \n And I am not presuming to tell them I know better. I am presenting the constant Judaeo-Christian teaching through the ages, not my own opinion. I am presenting it to those who have professed themselves Christian but yet want to distort the Christian revelation. I do not want to hurt these people but to bring them closer to the truth of the faith. Unfortunately, our faith requires sacrifice at times, as Jesus showed us.",

It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that \"homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.\" They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.\n \n 2358  The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.\n \n 2359  Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.",

But don't confuse what is possible with what is right. That would lead to a confusing morality in all aspects of life. The possibility of something does not ensure its moral integrity.\n \n Furthermore, if one kicks a football while at the same time ignoring or contravening the inherent purpose of the foot--that is to bear the weight of the body, to balance, to walk, etc.--then he will fall. So too with sex. If one contravenes its inherent purpose to procreate then he will fall at some point. But notice that I do not say that pleasure is not a purpose of sex in the sense that it is uniting to two who love one another. It is one of the purposes of sex. Both purposes must be maintained or the detriment of one or the other of the partners will likely occur. \n \n The Church maintains that there are two indispensible aspects of the sexual act: 1. the procreative 2. the unitive. For this reason it forbids actions that neglect the pleasure and presence of the physical act of sex itself between spouses. The Church isn't simply concerned with populating the world by ensuring contraception isn't used to thwart procreation (whether in the form of the pill, withdrawal, or homosexual acts) as many make it out to be. In fact, the Church says that one may plan family size as they see fit considering all relevant issues.\n \n \n2366  Fecundity is a gift, an end of marriage, for conjugal love naturally tends to be fruitful. A child does not come from outside as something added on to the mutual love of the spouses, but springs from the very heart of that mutual giving, as its fruit and fulfillment. So the Church, which is \"on the side of life,\" teaches that \"it is necessary that each and every marriage act remain ordered per se to the procreation of human life.\" \"This particular doctrine, expounded on numerous occasions by the Magisterium, is based on the inseparable connection, established by God, which man on his own initiative may not break, between the unitive significance and the procreative significance which are both inherent to the marriage act.\"\n \n 2369 \"By safeguarding both these essential aspects, the unitive and the procreative, the conjugal act preserves in its fullness the sense of true mutual love and its orientation toward man's exalted vocation to parenthood.\"\n \n 2376  Techniques that entail the dissociation of husband and wife, by the intrusion of a person other than the couple (donation of sperm or ovum, surrogate uterus), are gravely immoral. These techniques (heterologous artificial insemination and fertilization) infringe the child's right to be born of a father and mother known to him and bound to each other by marriage. They betray the spouses' \"right to become a father and a mother only through each other.\"\n \n 2377  Techniques involving only the married couple (homologous artificial insemination and fertilization) are perhaps less reprehensible, yet remain morally unacceptable. They dissociate the sexual act from the procreative act. The act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act by which two persons give themselves to one another, but one that \"entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of domination is in itself contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children.\" \"Under the moral aspect procreation is deprived of its proper perfection when it is not willed as the fruit of the conjugal act, that is to say, of the specific act of the spouses' union . . . . Only respect for the link between the meanings of the conjugal act and respect for the unity of the human being make possible procreation in conformity with the dignity of the person.\"\n\n \n Finally, to stick the organ of urination and sex in the orifice for defecation just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Sanitation wise, its not a good idea. This gives us a clue that this was not an intended purpose between these two areas.\n \n My posts are at odds with human evolution?

Is adoption asking for a Fall as well?\n \n \n \n\n Finally, to stick the organ of urination and sex in the orifice for defecation just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Sanitation wise, its not a good idea. This gives us a clue that this was not an intended purpose between these two areas.\n Sticking the organ of urination into any hole seems a little bizarre and it is possible to do it hygenically. However it is possible and it is pleasurable (or so I'm told anyway) - clearly this is another intended purpose.\n Most of what we eat harms us, our own immune system harms us whilst trying to remove an infection, producing the energy we need to move around harms us. Nothing we do is completely 'safe' as far as our bodies are concerned so why would expect this to be?\n \n \n\n My posts are at odds with human evolution? There are many points at odds with the Darwinian evolution proposed in the past. This is becoming more and more apparent. But that is another debate.\n Indeed, thats why we use the neo-darwinian model. Still you can't start using 'intended purposes' without running into this problem, unless you want to admit you're a creationist and that you don't really understand any of the science you claim to have backing you up. Even without taking this into account, as came up on one of the abortion threads - 'intended purpose' has a lot of problems with it. You either have everything was intended or nothing above the level of animals is, I don't see how you could logically mix and match",

I thought the IVF treatment ban was more to do with the process (i.e several eggs are fertilised but only a few are developed and generally of those only one will implant) rather than a lack of sex. In a lot of cases the difference is really quite slim - just the sperm are given a helping hand, the gametes are from both parents who love each other. There is a likely a lot more love going into expensive and difficult IVF treatment than many traditional cases of intercourse that leads to a child.\n \n Also raises the question of why some children are purposely born only to be given away or to suffer whilst others can't be born to loving parents naturally.\n \n \n \n\n I am just saying that the risks one encounters are high and it just seems weird to use the container and eliminator of poop as an avenue of pleasure, eroticism, and sexuality. The two don't mix in my opinion.\n Well, pleasure, erotism and sexuality seem quite closely linked to it - seems bizarre to me as well but I've seen enough evidence to assume that it must be quite nice if you are into that sort of thing. The risks are relative too, though if we are looking from a purely chaste (using your defintion - i.e nothing or only your spouse) then I suppose it is slightly riskier. Seems to put it at the same level as premarital sex or adultry. Can't see the church banning marriage in the first case though. \n \n\n But we must also be aware not to put pleasure as the sole or highest goal. The well-being of the other in not using them as an object of pleasure is a concern, as is health, as is the contraceptive mentality that blocks God's hand in creation and puts forth hostility to life.\n\n There is a fine line between using someone as an object of pleasure, and the shared experience that unites people. Whilst you may personally feel it is Gods role in the union of marriage that does this, I would say its more a property of the action itself with someone you love - it is more than just pleasure. Seems almost what you are saying is that it may be possible to be attracted to another man, but not to love them like you would a woman?\n \n \n\n I will be the first to admit that I am no expert on evolution. Why does all have to be intended or none?\n Because when it comes down to it we are really quite badly designed, there is a lot of things in the body that just cause problems or work fairly badly that not only can we see a superior way of doing it we also find better versions in nature. On top of that, soon as you start having God intending something that he isn't directly intervening in (say setting the process going right at the beginning knowing humanity would result), not only are you going to tread on Free Will but its just as easy to argue that IVF and homosexuality are intended because they happened.",
