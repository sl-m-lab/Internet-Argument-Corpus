Selective damage of the brain of the creature causing noticable drop in cognitive capabilities though does prove a correlation, a direct link from a philosophical basis may be very hard to prove.\n \n \nIt's not that you are this brain, it's that this brain created you.

The brain, the basic instinct drived animal 'decision engine' makes decisions, the 'I' right after the 'hidden decision' is made simply deludes itself that it has rationally 'decided' to make the decision of one's free will.\n \n IIRC I once read an investigation of how the synapses firing for a particular action (say raising an arm) happen BEFORE one (the 'I') consciously chooses to do something.\n \n The 'I' then at best is a slow but thoughtful entity which wrestles for control of the body with the faster but impulsive brain and spinal chord. \n \n At worst the 'I' is a self deluding entity who's self awareness has arisen simply as an evolutionary trade off for having a better auditory brain functions -- delusions of control, and free will are the necessary for the 'I' to remain sane...

Take our vision for example. Thousands of photoreceptors report a point of colour. This means nothing on its own.

It combines patterns into higher order patterns, eventually forming predictive patterns. The brain takes reports and makes them into images, or illusions. That is its purpose.\n \n The same process, however, turns inward, too. The brain needs to describe itself to itself, and does so by creating the \"I\" we are talking about. The \"I\" is an illusion in the brain, the same as a waling tiger is actually an illusion. Thus, consciousness.\n \n Or, put more simply: I is what it \"feels\" like to be a brain to a brain.\n \n Why? Evolution. Some sort of decision making is needed for life, only the most primitive organisms can function fully on automatic. Where to seek for food, recognize mates and similar. Pattern recognition is useful for this, because it allows the organism to be more effective - an evolutionary trait. And once the ability started, it has begun to become ever more complex. From the simple ability to track a layer of nutrients in the water, we have come to the rather amazing ability to form abstract patterns. Evolution favours the ability to recognize patterns greatly. We dominate our world precisely because of this ability.\n \n It is not perferct, though. Our predisposition towards recognizing patterns can lead to the recognition of patterns that are not really there. Gambler's errors. Superstitions. Depression. Religion. All these are based upon false recognition of patterns.\n \n \n So, why are you you? A body was formed, the usual way, I hope. It developed a brain. The brain gathered input from its senses, and converted this input into patterns. And it formed itself into a pattern, creating the \"you\". All bodies do this, well, almost all of them. Some are said to never do so, and remain comatose, while some form more than one I, if schisophrenia is what it is supposed to be and not just a well thought of court defence.\n \n Essentially, each body forms an I, and can only form that I, since the I is a product of that body. Ask yourself \"Why is this my arm and not anothers' \" and you will get the same answer.\n \n What you are looking for is \"Who chose?\". No one chose. There is no choice involved in the issue.\n \n \n Now, the planets are orbiting around because the gravity of the central sun draws them toward the central point, while their velocity drives them into a linear morion, which dynamically adds up to a curved path. You can (metaphorically) either start asking questions about \"why are the paths elliptical and not circular\" (which I cannot really provide, I'm not an expert on the cognitive), or you can continue to ask about the wider issues, which we, I hope, can provide.",

   "For the benefit of those still reading this thread, I'm going to go ahead and let this cat out of its bag:\n \n http://www.bidstrup.com/why.htm\n \n After you read that, go here: http://www.platonia.com/index.html if you want to watch the short film of the physicist's theory.\n \n You will need at least a little background knowledge of modern physics, but I don't think that will be a problem for most here.\n \n Most people on this thread are just asking themselves the wrong questions. However, I'm not sure I quite like this theory (in the links above) completely, because it seems to have a couple problems. But, we can discuss those after people visit the links (or at least the top link, which I'll go ahead and paste below).\n \n \n\n Why Am I Me?\n Some thoughts on the origin and nature of consciousness\n An essay in hypertext by Scott Bidstrup\n \n Why am I me?\n \n This is a question that almost everyone has asked as a child, but with all our modern technology and scientific insight, no one knows.\n \n Science says the question is beyond its ability to answer, so it refuses to speculate.\n \n Religion has attempted to answer it, but with conflicting, often demonstrably false theories, lacking in any credible evidence. But the question persists.\n \n It is a haunting, nagging question, often asked early in childhood and occasionally throughout life, and asking for an answer that is never there, yet a question that is an important one, as it touches on the very nature of human consciousness.\n \n For me personally, it was a challenge. I could not find an answer to that question, at least one that satisfied my desire for an answer to that question. So I kept turning in the only direction I could for an answer - to religion.\n \n I once entered into an email dialog with a fellow who accused me of being a closet religionist, as I believed at the time in the genuineness of my reincarnation regression experiences. He felt, and I secretly have to agree, that I had to invoke religious explanations to come up with the explanations that I was seeking. Nothing else seemed to offer the answer I was looking for.\n \n Well, I've since learned a lot about myself, about the hypnotic experiences that I had, and about the nature of the universe and of human consciousness itself. In particular, the insights of modern theoretical physics, and some of the explanations of the nature of the universe have had some bearing on my thinking. And so this essay is a distillation of the experiences and insights I've had.\n \n In a strictly material sense, it may be true that the matter that makes up me could have made up a tree, or a lizard or a rock or anything else. But what we're talking about here is consciousness; in particular, the consciousness which is unique to me, and not shared by anyone else. The matter that makes up my body has little relevance to the fact of my consciousness. It doesn't do one bit about explaining why I am me in terms of my consciousness. It just explains the fact of the carrier of my consciousness, my physical body. The body should not be confused with the consciousness. It's like confusing a program running on a computer with the computer itself.\n \n The personal distinction, which I experience as a personal consciousness, is quite independent of the matter that makes up my physical body, as when, for example, if a chunk of me is removed in surgery, I do not continue to experience what is happening to the removed chunk; it simply becomes a part of the world I experience and is no longer \"me.\"\n \n If that chunk includes living cells that are cloned into another complete, living, breathing, human being, that human being still isn't me, even though it had its beginnings in my body. It isn't me because it does not have my consciousness, as similar to mine though it may be/ It should be self evident that even if the chunk of me that is removed and 'grown' into another human body is a part of my brain, complete with my 'software' still running in it, it still isn't me because I don't experience what it (the new body) is experiencing. For it to be me, I would have to be conscious of and experiencing two lives at the same time, and I find that to be rather unlikely.\n \n The question posed to science, then, is how does science explain the uniqueness of my personal experience of consciousness? Until very recently, there was no possible answer. But now there is, based on the insights of theoretical physics. My answer is a bit involved, but bear with me:\n \n Modern physics implies \"action at a distance,\" a result of the process of observation. For example, electrons and other subatomic particles exhibit the properties of both waves and particles, but not at the same time, because many of the wave properties are incompatible with the particle properties. So experiments can be devised which force a particle to behave as either a particle or a wave, depending on the expectations of the observer. It can even be shown that it behaves as both, until it is observed, at which time it takes on one set of properties or the other, and does so instantly. Schrodinger's \"cat\" is both \"alive and dead\" until you look in the box, at which time it becomes one or the other.\n \n The act of observation of Schrodinger's cat is not a function of matter, it is a function of consciousness. This is a fact that is a demonstrable reality of science, and implies an inherent interconnectedness between the experimenter and the experiment. Einstein didn't like the idea (and fought tirelessly against it, in fact). He needn't have bothered. There's a purely rational explanation.\n \n Another example: if a pair of subatomic particles are created in a particle collision, and one of that pair has a 'top' spin, the other must have a 'bottom' spin, since spin is a conserved quantum, and it can be mathematically demonstrated that all the spin of all the particles in the universe must add up to zero. It has been demonstrated that if you reverse the spin of one of the pair, the other 'knows' that it must reverse it's spin for the total spin to continue to add to zero -- and it's spin will indeed reverse. But how does it 'know'? \n \n What science has recently concluded is that there is an infinite number of universes. Probabalistic events, such as Schrodinger's cat, mean that not just one, but two universes exist, one in which the cat is alive, and the other in which the cat is dead. The act of observing simply picks one of the universes. Every time a probabalistic event occurs, such as a coin toss, the universe splits in two, and there is then a heads universe and a tails universe. We proceed down, say, through the heads universe, and the tails universe becomes unknowable to us. We are unaware of its existence, but it exists nevertheless. All outcomes of all probabalistic events have led to independent universes. \n \n But it gets even more complex than that.\n \n The universes are not as we see a universe, but really are an infinite collection of frozen, eternal instances. These \"multiverses\" as the instances are called, are not at all as we experience the universe. It's like time is frozen and the contents of the multiverse are unchanging, like in a bad science fiction movie where time stands still. Each multiverse is a sort of \"snapshot\" as it were.\n \n We experience time because each of these multiverses has a point of congruence with other multiverses. We progress from the experience of one multiverse to another in rapid succession, and the result is what we experience as the illusion of time, and a single thread of multiverse congruences is what we call our consciousness. \n \n \n The Uniqueness of Individual Consciousness\n I do not know your mind and you do not know mine because for some unknown reason, these threads of congruence cannot overlap. Each is unique.\n Why am I me, then? It is simply because I am the only thread of congruences that is progressing through the multiverses that I am progressing through. It is really that simple. I am alone in that the thread of congruences I am experiencing is unique to me, and all the rest of you out there are all an illusion. As I am an illusion to you, since you are alone in the thread of congruences you are experiencing as consciousness.\n \n My consciousness is born when points of congruence emerge, and my consciousness ends when the points of congruence no longer continue.\n \n \n Why Haven't I heard more about this theory?\n This theory is brand new, and hasn't been rigorously tested yet. It is proposed by Julian Barbour, a physicist and mathematician living in South Newington, Oxford, England. It is but one consequence of a grand theory of his, intended to unify and explain many of the heretofore irreconcilable theories of the universe with which physicists are working.\n Physicists are tremendously excited about the theory, because as radical as it is, it offers the best hope yet at unifying quantum mechanics with Newtonian physics and relativity, as well as a means of unifying all the known forces of the universe into a single explanation.\n \n This theory as to the nature of time and the experience of the universe is a radically new concept for physics. The only place where I know it has been discussed in an accessible manner is in the pages of the December, 2000 issue of Discover magazine (page 54).\n \n",

   " \nIt depends on what you mean by \"me.\"\n\n \n That depends on what you mean by \"you\".\n\n \n emoticon_smile Yeah this is getting difficult...\n \n This is why I believe the concept of 'I', 'you', 'me' is meaningless.\n \n I wrote this a while ago -- \n \n \nWhat makes you, you? \n \n Recently I was thinking about of all things the 'transporter' of Star Trek fame and how theoretically it kills you by ripping you apart and then resurrecting you at another position. This made me wonder whether I'd actually like to try it if it ever exists because the first stage involves my death... I then started to think about what makes me, me - what aspect of my being is the ever constant 'presence' that myself and others will always recognise?\n \n Back when I was a new born baby I looked very different and in fact the cells of my body that existed then don't exist now yet if I was to ask someone who knew me at the time they'd say I was that baby. So if I am both that baby and a man today there must be some sort of link? DNA could possibly be the answer as it is the same today as it was when I was a baby. The only problem with DNA of course is that identical twins have the same DNA yet people who know them can point out that the twins are very different people. Every second cells die and are created in my body meaning if I simply view 'me' as my body then 'me' dies and is replaced almost constantly yet despite this fact neither I nor the people who know me recognise this change - they don't treat me as a different person.\n \n Once my musing over the body came to a dead end I then focussed on my 'mind'. I wondered about personality and whether this was where 'I' existed but then after some thought I realised many people have accidents where they are mentally damaged and have radically different personalities yet they are still considered 'themselves' by other people who know them and indeed by themselves. It can't be memory as it is in a constant state of change and expansion. Perhaps, I considered 'I' was the architecture of the components of my brain - my personality can change and so can my memory but the way I reason, and perceive stimulus remains constant? However, again I remembered the 'mental damage' situation where for example people have large parts of their brain destroyed yet they are still 'them' to the people who know them and to themselves if they are self aware.\n \n After exhausting the mind and the body I was some what flummoxed as to what else there could be - physical appearance changes all the time, so can speech, smell, body language, even names. It is very unlikely that I'm the first to consider this so what do you all think? Surely this is a subject those who have studied philosophy can readily give an answer too?\n\n \n This frame of reffernce point is interesting because I didn't consider it but, because the frame of reffernce also changes throughout your life (if it is what I think your implyign it is) where as you are always 'you'.",

   "I've done some thinking on the subject of teleportation and cloning and similar.\n \n In the absence of the concept of a soul, there is another aspect of us that poses trouble in these circumstances: continuity.\n \n To keep things short, it is my belief that you remain yourself as long as a continuity of the process is maintained, just like an old bike. If you replace part by part, you can have the same bike, even though none of the original parts remain. My own bike is on a good way in becoming thus, since the central support strut broke once and the \"skeleton\" needed replacement.\n \n If continuity is not maintained, you have a copy that may be the same for ALL intents and purposes but one: for the purpose of actually being yourself.",
