So here we are.\n \n As tempting as this is, one will note:\n First and foremost, this is my first chance to be back on 4forums in quite a long time (several months). In fact, my first post today included an aside that mentioned that I have plenty to do. There is no way I submit a post every 72 hours. And with my current schedule, I couldn't even commit to a post each weekend.\n 1000 words per post hardly gives enough words to get one started. How could one possibly make any sort of argument (besides an incomplete one) if the 1000 words includes copy/pastes and references in a debate regarding history?\n The scope of the debate either needs to be defined beforehand or needs to play into the agreement of the debate. What I mean by the latter is this: If the meaning of \"founded on Christian principles\" is supposed to be a part of the debate, then the debate parameters need to allow a portion, section, or at least an additional allocation (or simply a higher overall count) of words allowed in each post. Trying to cram (1) an explanation and defense of what actually is being debated, (2) citations and quotations supporting one's view, (3) discussion of citations and quotations, and (4) rebuttal to any opposing points into a small word count is essentially impossible.\n \n Maybe marc wants a real joke of a debate. After all, I can see how this resolution can be spun to be a sure \"win\" for marc by arguing for a resolution that really means nothing. He wouldn't even meet me halfway on his pet topic of \"evolution is atheistic,\" and so far I've seen no reason to believe that his performance in this topic will be any more than the nonsense we've seen over and over again in the main forums.\n \n Perhaps I'll make a point to drop in a bit more often if this debate gets started, and we'll see if I'm feeling up to dealing with marc again if nobody has taken him up on this challenge by the time my schedule calms down.",

   "This was an update to the original which contains additional information. I was unaware of the \"rules\" re: 72 hours between posts. \n\n \n I'm unaware of it too, you put the word \"rules\" in quotes as if I used that word, which I did not. \"Opening suggestions\" was how I put it. Subject to differing suggestions and propositions by any serious opponent. :) My formal debating history shows that I'm very flexible on those things. \n \n \nFirst, if something is stated 1000 times does NOT make it any more true than the first time. \n\n \n I agree that it SHOULD not, but in an imperfect world it can, and does in peoples' minds. The proof is how several polls show that an amazing number of people think that the phrase \"separation of church & state\" is in the Constitution, or Bill of Rights. \n \n \n The basic reading of the papers of the founding fathers can shed enormous light on your beliefs. \n\n \n It sure can, and that's what I would like a large part of this debate to consist of. \n \n \nI am not a militant atheist. I was born into a Christian, mainstream denomination. \n\n \n But some militant atheists jumped right in to that McCain bashing thread you started, and you never showed any disagreement with them. Do you understand that it can be difficult to distinguish you from a militant atheist? \n \n \n \n Following studies in a Virginia theological seminary, I decided that I am more of a Deist than a Christian.

People of differing worldviews have always disagreed on what the intent of the framers was, and the passing of time isn't causing them to come together on it. I think it's a great subject for a limited, structured debate, and I wish you'd consider doing it. The only reason I'm proposing short (1000) word limits is because my last formal debate was justly critisized for being too long. If you'd need longer than 72 hours, more words than 1000, then propose what you'd like, and I'm sure you, I, and a moderator could come to terms on it.",

Your rewording suggestions, and other taunts, are actually backtracking.\n\n Let's recap: You've been loudly proclaiming the Christian influence on the Founding Fathers for over a year here on 4forums. In fact, recall that the original thread had you wanting to look at the first 50 or 100 years of U.S. history to support your assertion. But in this thread, you've clearly said that the fact that those principles allegedly are of Christian nature has nothing to do with their incorporation into the Constitution.

But I say that in the broadest sense. The lady that holds her lamp beside the golden door doesn't say, \"I only welcome Christians.\" We welcome the poor, the tired, the huddled masses. But when they come here they know that they are in a nation founded on Christian principles.\" \n\n \n \nOf course, anyone who is familiar with American history knows McCain is mistaken. Since he's a very well educated man, it appears that he knows differently but wants to win votes. \n \n America was NOT founded on Christianity at all! \n\n \n DrD echos the starting point for religious debating for at least 20 or 30 regular posters on these forums. The disagreement is not complicated - the U.S. WAS, or WAS NOT founded on Christian principles. \"Where Christianity and secular thought converge or part\" would be part of the debate. The judge(s) would have to divide it according to what was said. \n \n jyoshu said this in post #6 of that thread;\n \n \n.....the U.S. was indeed founded on principles that came out of Judeo/Christian culture and thinking? \n\n \n Resolved; The U.S. was founded on principles that came out of Judeo Christian culture and thinking. \n \n If that's not acceptable, I'm open for more suggestions. OR, maybe electrolyte would consider taking the affirmative with a resolution such as;\n \n Resolved; \"America was not founded on Christianity at all\". \n \n I would take the negative on that, or something similar. \n \n \n \nIn any event, I hope this potential debate will bear fruit. I would look forward to reading it with interest. I would be happy to moderate if you both agree. It would be a nice addition to the Formal Debate Room.\n\n \n I'll accept you as moderator. As a previous moderator, participant, and observer of all these formal debates, what would you suggest on word limits this time? IMO word limits are an ongoing experiment, any ideas for something new this time? In my experience, word limits for participants remarks combined with no limits for copy/pastes is a bad idea. Severe limits on copy pastes with little or no limits on participants remarks may be an experiment worth trying, but the word limit issue is not important to me.",

   "You worry too much about \"winning\". I like the idea of a good, thought provoking discussion. I don't know why you're so picky about it - there's no money involved.\n\n Actually, you might not remember that when billsco was taking suggestions for possible changes, I asked about having formal debates with no official judges. Sort of a let-the-reader-decide kind of thing, with a related thread for everyone to discuss the debate. You also might not remember the fallout from your debate with Peeling where I suggested requiring a more defined scope for each debate where I heartily argued that debate should be more about presenting sound argumentation than \"sport,\" sending an opponent down rabbit trails such that s/he loses the debate.\n What I meant there was that I prefer that these things are defined, that way a judge knows what he's judging from the get-go rather than having to judge a debate within the debate just to be able to judge the debate... But I digress; more pertinent material below.\n \n \nBy \"both\", I meant \"have a parallel in\" and are part of the debate.\n\n My mistake. I didn't see how we could be clarifying here and leaving it up for debate.\n \n \nI'm the one taking the affirmative, and the resolution has to be mine.\n\n Very true.\n \n \nI've compromised just about enough.\n\n Quite possibly true. I'll accept the resolution in its current form, \"All basic principles in the U.S. Constitution are Christian in nature,\" with the issues of which principles are \"basic\" and the meaning of \"Christian in nature\" to be a part of the debate.\n \n I'm going to presume that we'll argue these \"internal\" issues simultaneously as opposed to working in discrete phases?\n \n \nI've left the word limit discussion pretty much up to you and the officials - I think you need to start focusing on that. You haven't even approved Steeeve as one judge yet. You need to show more willingness to do this.\n\n I'll accept Steeeeve and daewoo as a pair of judges. (I actually wrote this earlier before realizing that further issues needed to be addressed, so it didn't get submitted.)\n Regarding word count, I feel that the matter of these additional \"internal\" issues will constitute a non-negligible part of our submissions, so I'll again suggest a word count maximum higher than Steeeeve's particular liking: 3500. Properly formatted with breaks and headers, this is really not as imposing as it first seems.\n \n marc's opening statement could be posted at any time, but I ask that my opening statement not be due until the first week in November due to my schedule; I am working and moving, so my free time only comes when I'm off the clock and there's no rain. If marc would prefer to wait until this weekend, I would have no problem with that. I would also like to stick with the 7 day maximum between posts.\n \n Besides a third judge (and pending acceptance of the terms by all parties), what else do we lack?",
