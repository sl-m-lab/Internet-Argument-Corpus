Perhaps if other http://www.4forums.com/political/images/smilies/xkill.gif\n emoticon_xkilltypes of firearms were as strictly regulated as machine guns are then we could make some real progress in reducing gun violence and murder.\n\n \n \n \n \n International/UN Gun Control Issues\n Backfire in Britain\n \n \n \"... a social paradise concocted by politicians who believed that civilized society could only be made crime-free through the confiscation of all arms.``\n \n Want to see that celebrated British stiff upper lip begin to quiver? Just mention to Parliament or press that England is not the isle of tranquility envisioned more than a century ago, when the nation began the systematic disarmament of its citizens.\n \n After years of chipping away at private firearm ownership through passage of a rash of seemingly innocuous rules and regulations, with the adoption of a total handgun ban in 1997, the British achieved what was hailed as the \"gold standard\" of gun control. At the time, leading newspapers in England heralded this \"restraint on personal liberty\" as \"essential to the happiness\" of the country`s law-abiding.\n \n The credo was a simple but vacuous one: fewer guns mean fewer crimes. Essentially, it was the legal intention that \"nobody, except a soldier, sailor or policeman\" should ever have access to a handgun. Simultaneously, the courts took up the cause, prosecuting those who resisted violent attacks with any sort of armed reaction. Over time, it became evident that predators were apt to be judged less harshly than victims who used any type of device, even a stout stick, in an act of self-defense.\n \n According to the utopian scheme of things, gun bans were supposed to evoke a kinder and gentler world-a social paradise concocted by politicians who believed that civilized society could only be made crime-free through the confiscation of all arms. At the same time, it seemed pertinent for the government to also divest British citizenry of all normal human reactions regarding self-preservation.\n \n The results have been as tragic as they were predictable.\n \n A litany of failures were apparent as early as the year 2000, when CBS News reported that law and order in Britain was deteriorating at a rapid rate, while the country was experiencing a crime surge much more severe than any recorded within the United States.\n \n \"Have a nice daydream,\" was the retort fired back at CBS from editorialists with the London Mirror, the same daily newspaper fond of pointing out that the British crime rate was \"nothing at all compared\n \n to the Wild West culture on the other side of the Atlantic, where every other car is carrying a gun.\"\n \n However, in time, in stories sandwiched between inside pages, the newspaper conceded that CBS was right. \"Britain has overtaken the U.S. for all major crimes,\" the newspaper admitted. In fact, the motherland was indeed racing ahead by a substantial lead, sporting a crime rate in England and Wales that at times peaked at as much as 60 percent above crime statistics here in the States, with gun crimes especially prominent.\n \n So how could a nation operating under an alleged discipline of total disarmament suddenly become victim to a spike of armed, violent crime? Especially a country that advanced the notion that individuals had a right to personal security more than 100 years before it became a fixture in America?\n \n Consider that William Blackstone, an early British champion of working-class citizens, argued that the right of self-protection was one no government could take away. Another champion of individual rights, A.V. Dicey, cautioned that if the government discouraged self-help, then loyal subjects became the slaves of ruffians.\n \n It`s no wonder that the U.S. Constitution would feature a Bill of Rights insisting on a Right to Keep and Bear Arms. For generations following the British insistence on equal rights for its citizens, including the right to self-defense, subjects of the Crown were among the safest and most law-abiding in the world, with a crime rate that truly was the envy of its neighbors.\n \n Things began to disintegrate in the 20th century with the passage of laws that increasingly restricted private possession of firearms, along with edicts forbidding the right to carry arms for self-protection. Eventually, British law determined that even vigorous self-defense could only be \"reasonable in the circumstances.\" By 1969, British police officers were told by higher authorities \"it should never be necessary for anyone to possess a firearm for the protection of his house or person.\"\n \n British wags were quick to point out that the justice system appeared to have its philosophical hat on backwards. One commentator said the courts seemed to regard the scandal of the killing of a robber as of greater consequence than the safety of the robber`s victim. Such comments soon were both numerous and scathing, and not without good reason.\n \n Grumblings in the British press increasingly mirrored grassroots opinions about the plight of the law-abiding: \"The monumentally useless British police, with greater manpower per capita, higher rates of pay and with far more lavish resources than the Americans, haven`t had an original idea in decades, so they cling ever more fiercely to their core ideology: the best way to deal with criminals is to impose ever greater restrictions and inconveniences on the law-abiding.\"\n In 2002, the chances of being mugged in London were approximately six times greater than in New York City, cultural center of the \"lawless Wild West\" so often mocked by British snobbery.\n \n Another accused Tony Blair of going \"total: blame everyone, ban everything.\"\n \n Gang activity is certainly at the root of Britain`s climbing crime rate, and much of the lawlessness can be traced back to disaffected youth in England`s rust belt, where jobs are few and hope is diminishing.\n \n Essentially, the firearm issue never has been about the guns themselves, but more about eroding social mores balanced against the rights of the individual. And while America has thus far managed to protect its Right to Keep and Bear Arms for self-protection (borrowed for use in our Constitution from the 1689 English Bill of Rights), many of the English rank and file clamor to have theirs back as societal mayhem takes advantage of the vacuum created by disarmament.\n \n Dismayed Brits point to their country`s egregious gun laws, the toughest firearm restrictions of any democracy, and argue that they not only didn`t reduce violent crime but managed, as documented by the British press, to leave \"law-abiding citizens at the mercy of criminals confident (their) victims have neither the means nor legal rights to resist them.\" The BBC reported that gun bans \"seem to have little impact on the criminal underworld,\" while the use of handguns to commit crimes rose 40 percent during the two years following the total ban on them.\n \n Simultaneously, the number of innocent citizens robbed at gunpoint rose some 53 percent. In 2002, the chances of being mugged in London were approximately six times greater than in New York City, cultural center of the \"lawless Wild West\" so often mocked by British snobbery. Overall, rates of assault, robbery and burglary shot past those recorded in America and, maybe most ominously, 53 percent of British burglaries were said to occur while the residents were still in their homes.\n \n Even so, British lawmakers have stuck to the notion that people don`t need to protect themselves, because society can and will. And, in a defenseless populace besieged by a growing climate of violence, police urge individuals witnessing a crime to walk on by as if nothing had happened; to let the pros handle it . . . if only they could.\n \n Contrast this to attitudes in the U.S., where law enforcement professionals are among the first to acknowledge that police can`t be everywhere and can`t protect everyone from criminal attack, and that in many instances individuals have not only a right but a responsibility to protect lives, family and property. At the same time, the majority of candid police officials in this country openly admit that it would be nearly impossible to rid the nation of firearms if guns were banned, or to keep illegal guns from entering the country.\n \n British citizens have found this out the hard way. They found it out in a delivery truck allegedly loaded only with frozen pizzas, a truck with a Croatian driver carrying smuggled firearms in the midst of all that cheese and crust. They also found it in the post-war economy of the Balkans, a region accustomed to supplying guns to those willing to supply cash in return, no matter what laws may be on the books. They found it in the numbers of deactivated, collectible guns refitted to work on the street. And the English have found, to their dismay, that governmental decrees don`t necessarily receive consensus respect. There are and will continue to be firearms in Britain, even if Parliament demands the surrender of everything from fine double barrel skeet guns to the most common child`s air rifle. The proof, no matter the amount of bureaucratic gibberish to the contrary, continues to generate headlines that shock the nation.\n \n British society remains outraged by stories like the one involving the murder of an 11-year-old boy, a bright and personable child walking home from football practice, gunned down for no apparent reason by another youth riding a bicycle. Brits have seen gunfire erupt in a courtroom when armed men sought to free two defendants in a nightclub shooting. They`ve listened to reports concerning two men killed by automatic gun fire in what had been a quiet residential neighborhood, and read headlines about the 19-year-old woman killed while walking along a main street in East London, murdered by thugs who sought to steal her cell phone.\n \n According to the Manchester (England) Guardian, Manchester residents fear that the city is slipping into what they refer to as \"Gunchester days\" due to gang activity and shootings. And there`s little consolation to be found in the fact that Parliament promised it couldn`t happen, that the civilian population would be compensated for the loss of personal liberty by heightened law enforcement-a sad state of affairs from a country that gave the world the Magna Carta.\n \n Maybe the most chilling scenarios generated by Britain`s attempt to legislate a disarmed society are the tribulations of those simply seeking to survive it. Take for instance the English homeowner who used a toy gun to detain burglars caught in his home. When police arrived, the homeowner himself was arrested for using a fake firearm to threaten or intimidate.\n \n Or consider the plight of an elderly woman who fired a cap pistol in an attempt to frighten away a group of young rowdies who besieged her. She was arrested for placing someone in fear.\n \n Or how about the businessman who, during a mugging, pulled an ornamental knife from his cane and used it to slash his way out of what he feared to be a deadly confrontation. Even though he thought he was on the verge of losing his life, the petroleum executive was convicted of carrying an \"offensive weapon.\"\n \n Rather than face the fact that gun control has actually opened a Pandora`s box of violence rather than closed the lid more tightly, an arrogant Parliament and societal upper crust have instead chosen to punish those they can most easily-the remaining Brits with backbone enough to fight for their rights as law-abiding citizens. After all, gangs and street toughs shoot back-and have the firearms to do so in spite of propaganda to the contrary.\n \n In 1962, Anthony Burgess wrote a book called A Clockwork Orange, a futuristic look at random violence as a way of life among disenfranchised and desensitized British youth. The book would become the 1971 classic film of the same name by Stanley Kubrick.\n \n At the time, the subject matter horrified viewers around the world. Yet today, they can watch much the same thing on British TV news.\n \n Perhaps the time has come for Britain to rethink its restrictions on the rights of good citizens, and focus on the mayhem routinely practiced by the bad ones. If Parliament would only do the right thing and take necessary steps to reinstate the most basic human right of self-preservation, then maybe those of us here in the United States would resist the urge to say, \"I told you so,\" and instead cheer the resurrection of liberty back in the land where it started.\n \n emoticon_xkill",

I don't think that gun control is the most important issue in the world but I do intend to own one as soon as I move out of NY in hopefully a year or 2. I totally agree that people should be free to own guns, as they are. I also have no problems with states making it mandatory for gun owners to have permits, which some states do. I'm not an extremist. I plan to teach my kids how to properly use guns, much to my wife's protest.

The pro-gun camp fears that any gun regulation policies, something as simple as a county registration, will inevitably lead to policies that ban all guns. And the anti-gun crowd fears that if people can own guns at all, then gun-toting bandits will jump out of every alley and start popping people randomly. So its a case of total gun freedom vs total \"gunlessness\". I'm not convinced that either of these \"what-if\" scenarios will occur. After all, as it is presently, gun crimes still occur, people have their rights to own guns revoked on a case by case basis, and dying of gun shots is actually very rare. I believe a balance can be found. \n \n And as for supporting the constitution, this issue is actually about supporting an ammendment to the constitution. If the constitution was so holy and inerrant, why did it need to be ammendments? I'm not the one that was so dissatisfied with the document that I had to ammend it anyway. And the insinuations and inuendos you say I made (not actually saying what they were), the rest of your pro-gun team confirmed my observations, just as you did now. Thanks.",

   "unkerpaulie. \n \n Your argument is a false one. You seem to want to speak like you are the voice of moderation, because there are no gun laws, and you are only looking to be reasonable. Allow me to inform you that there are already a ton of gun laws! \n \n   The &#8220;Unregulated&#8221; Gun  \n &#8220;Gun Laws of America is 384 pages of just the federal statutes that regulate guns&#8212;more than 88,000 words. Additionally, the associated federal regulations interpreting these laws are even larger. Minimum penalty for a violation is typically 5 years in federal prison for every offense.\n \n It is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America. Those laws include restrictions on possession, carry, distribution, storage, transfer, manufacture, sale, ownership, importation, use and more. \n\n \n Allow me to remind everyone about all of the Federal gun laws We the People gave to the Gun HATERS during the Clinton Administration.\n 1.Brady background checks for all handgun buyers, \n 2.institution of the waiting period,\n 3. Making it illegal for anyone under 18 to own or even possess a handgun.\n 4. The President's executive order stopping the importation of many guns,\n 5. Excessive fees and regulations that drove many legitimate gun shop owners out of business.\n 6. The widening of Brady to include background checks from just handguns to include all new firearm purchases. \n 7. Insta Check! \n 8. Additional disqualification's and changes to legal firearms purchases on form 4473, \n 9. The assault weapons ban. \n 10. The ten round magazine,\n 11 Lautenburg.\n and just recently the NICS improvement act!\n \n So who is actually being unreasonable? \n \n The problem is that you want to give them even more of our Constitutionally recognized as Inalienable Right. So where do we stop the giving and when do we get to the QUOTE \"REASONABLE\" part? \n \n President Obama described the Bill of Rights as a negative Right against Government. He hit it right on the head! Government by Constitutional design is not allowed to go any further then a reasonable standard of safety! The vast number of gun laws that we already have, up and until 1968, was thought by our Fathers to be sufficient to protect our LEO's and our Society while preserving the integrity of our Constitution! \n \n unkerpaulie, does any of this change your position? Unfortunately, I suspect probably not. But I could be wrong.",

You fail to demonstrate how registration creates a level of protection. All you have shown is it is a feel good do nothing sop to the fear filled ones. You readily admit that registration is not going to prevent gun crimes or even lessen them. Given the black market traffic in guns in even the socialist paradises of UK and Japan, does not guarantee a gun can be traced to the perp who committed the crime. Given the lack of prevention, lack of even lessening them plus the very real danger of confiscation you have no plus in registration. Yet you seem to blindly go forth in either allowing or promoting it. I wonder why? Again, the target is those who obey the laws. The courts up to the supreme court have held that criminals can't be made to register guns. Exactly where is the problem that we need to target the law abiding? \n \n As to those who fear gun crimes let them move to some place where they have no guns such as UK or Japan. ",

   "What are you talking about? I've been down this road before. I don't think that gun control is the most important issue in the world but I do intend to own one as soon as I move out of NY in hopefully a year or 2. I totally agree that people should be free to own guns, as they are. I also have no problems with states making it mandatory for gun owners to have permits, which some states do. I'm not an extremist. I plan to teach my kids how to properly use guns, much to my wife's protest. And I'll probably own more than one, at least one in my bedroom and one in my car. \n \n What I don't get is the what seems to me like an overwhelming fear of \"what if\" from both sides. The pro-gun camp fears that any gun regulation policies, something as simple as a county registration, will inevitably lead to policies that ban all guns. And the anti-gun crowd fears that if people can own guns at all, then gun-toting bandits will jump out of every alley and start popping people randomly. So its a case of total gun freedom vs total \"gunlessness\". I'm not convinced that either of these \"what-if\" scenarios will occur. After all, as it is presently, gun crimes still occur, people have their rights to own guns revoked on a case by case basis, and dying of gun shots is actually very rare.

Driving, voting, selling medicine, etc is a privilige not a right. I'd also point out that when you require a license for it then its no longer a right.\n \n A couple weeks ago, I posted what I went through to start the\n process of getting a pistol permit in NY City. Here's the final\n version. I now have a NYC Pistol Permit (Target).\n \n This post is long, reflecting the length and complexity of the\n process. I have a copy of the NYC pistol permit rules, detailing\n all the different permits available. If anyone wants more info,\n drop me some e-mail.\n \n The following rules apply to this particular permit:\n - The gun must be stored unloaded and locked up at home, ammo\n separate.\n - I can only transport the gun when going directly to and from a\n shooting site.\n - The gun must be unloaded and locked up, ammo separate, when\n being transported to and from the shooting site. It must be in\n the back of my vehicle, not within easy access.\n \n Below is what has been required, so far. I chose to use a permit\n service that prepares the paperwork for me. Using the service is\n not required, but it made things a little quicker and simpler,\n and reduced the chance I'd waste time by screwing something up.\n \n 1) I visited the sporting goods store that offers the permit\n service. I paid them $320.07 to do the following:\n Prepare my application form.\n Take the required photographs.\n Provide me with a 1 year membership at their pistol range\n (Normally $211.58 for first year)\n Supply letter stating I belonged to their range.\n Notarize everything.\n Explain the process to me, and \"pre-interview\" me (see\n below).\n \n 2) It took them about a week to get the materials ready, so I\n visited them again to pick it all up.\n \n 3) I got two postal money orders:\n $170 for the application processing fee.\n $50 for the fingerprinting and fingerprint search.\n (Now raised to $74!).\n \n 4) I took the following to 1 Police Plaza, Room 110 in lower\n Manhattan (Hours are Monday-Friday 8:30-3:00, meaning I had to\n take time off work):\n Application. (Lots of detailed info goes on here).\n 2 head and shoulders photo's.\n 2 Postal money orders.\n Birth certificate or Passport (proof of birthdate).\n Proof of Residence (utility bill).\n Notarized letter from range.\n Driver's license.\n \n Once there, the clerk reviewed my application and paperwork,\n assigned me a serial number, and had me fill out the back of three\n fingerprint cards. One asked if I had ever received any\n summonses. I asked if that includes traffic tickets. She had me\n write a letter explaining that I have received (and paid) parking\n tickets in the past, then had me take it to a local drug store to\n have it notarized. I did that, and then she took three full sets\n of fingerprints, plus a thumbprint that went on the application.\n I was told that I would hear from them some time in the future\n about coming in for an interview.\n \n 5) About 3.5 months later, I got a letter telling me to call\n Police Officer X, who was my investigator, to arrange an\n interview. It also asked me to have my supervisor at work fill\n out a questionnaire, and to prepare a notarized letter explaining\n the fact that my given first name is different from the name I use\n daily (My given name is Greek, and I use an approximate English\n translation). The questionnaire my boss completed asked questions\n like \"Is he sober on the job,\" and asked if he thought I was OK to\n be allowed to own a gun. I called to arrange the interview.\n \n 6) I took another day off work to go for the interview. Lasted\n maybe 10-15 minutes. He was friendly enough, as all the people so\n far have been. At least they're not looking at me like a\n slobbering gun nut lunatic. Questions included (I'm\n paraphrasing):\n What do you want to use the gun for?\n How'd you hear about what is required for a permit?\n Do you belong to a range?\n How often do you want to shoot?\n Do you have a lock box at home?\n Do you understand the rules, and the consequences of breaking\n them?\n \n We talked for a while, explained that I was interested in target\n shooting, not in home defense (pre-interview helped here), and\n told him I planned to shoot maybe twice a week at a couple\n different sites. No problems. I asked for clarification of the\n rules, and he explained it all to me. He asked if I wanted the\n \"residence/limited target\" permit, which allows two trips per\n month to the range, you specify them in advance and they are\n listed on your permit, but lets you keep the gun loaded at home.\n \n He told me my fingerprint cards had come back early, and that I'd\n be getting a letter in two weeks or less that my permit was\n approved and ready.\n \n 7) I got the letter notifying me that my permit was ready. I was\n to show up at 1 Police Plaza between 9 AM and noon on Monday-\n Thursday within 30 days of the date on the letter to receive my\n permit. I took another day off work and drove in to Manhattan.\n Paid $16.50 for two hours parking. I got there just before 9 AM\n but still had to wait about 45 minutes. A clerk gave me some\n forms to read and sign, including one release form stating that my\n possession of a pistol permit was subject to disclosure under the\n Freedom of Information Act. I reviewed the info on the permit,\n and applied my thumb print to the back.\n \n The clerk gave me the permit, a booklet explaining the rules, a\n sheet of paper discussing the use of deadly physical force, some\n more paperwork, and a purchase authorization slip. This last\n piece of paper allows me to purchase one handgun. I must use it\n within 30 days of issuance. If I don't use it, I must return it\n within 10 days of expiration. If I don't return it, whether I use\n it or not, my permit will be revoked.\n \n I purchased my hand gun. They filled out a bunch of paperwork,\n including the lower part of the purchase authorization form. The\n gun must be presented for inspection at 1 Police Plaza within 72\n hours of purchase.\n \n 9) I brought the gun, unloaded and locked in a case, to 1 Police\n Plaza for inspection. Paid $11.50 for an hour of parking.\n Inspection hours are noon to 2 PM weekdays. A police officer\n checked the serial number, I filled out an index card, and the\n clerk took back the authorization form. She then typed the pistol\n ID information on my permit.\n \n My target permit entitles me to one handgun. If I want more, I\n have to request an additional authorization form, and give a\n reason for wanting another gun. Processing the authorization\n request takes 6 weeks. I have to pick it up in person, and\n present the gun in person, as above.\n \n ---\n \n In summary, the permit and acquisition of 1 handgun for target\n shooting requires:\n Lots of paperwork and documentation.\n Legwork to get everything ready.\n $220 in fees to the city of New York.\n Signing all your rights away.\n $360 or so in other expenses and range membership fee.\n This may vary.\n Four trips to 1 Poice Plaza, requiring 3 days off work.\n (I got the permit and presented the gun in one day).\n A waiting period of four months. (usually 6 months).\n \n I won't count the vacation time I had to use or the gas I burned.\n Each additional gun purchase requires two more trips to 1 Police\n Plaza and 6 weeks or so waiting, assuming they approve it.\n \n There are other varieties of permit, including premises permits\n and various forms of carry permits. The latter require, I\n believe, justification e.g. cash business, security guard, etc.\n and are usually limited in one way or another.\n \n The city also requires permits for rifles. Since I had a pistol\n permit, the rifle permit took only one 10 minute visit (to a\n different building in an different part of the city). Cost $55.\n Without a pistol permit it takes weeks to months.\n Each rifle must be registered, and you have to carry the\n registration certificate whenever you transport it (unloaded and\n locked in an opaque container, of course).\n \n If anyone in other parts of the country is wondering how bad it\n can get, just consider what we live with in NYC. Things can't get\n too much worse without them banning handgun ownership outright.\n \n This seems so unconstitutional to me that I wonder whether it has\n ever been challenged. Does anyone know?\n How to get a gun permit in NYC",

Some say that ANY form of gun regulation only leads to the inevitabe end result of a total gun ban, so don't make any.\n\n \n Well unfortunately that's the problem. Any little concession we make, it's never enough. With every new law we allow to be passed somebody on the gun control side is like \"now that we got that law passed we're going to try for this one. Now that we got that one we've got another we want.\" And this just continues over and over and over again. Well I'm tired of it. We've given an ***load away, and what have we gotten back in return? Where are the concessions of the anti-gunners? What have they given up in the name of compromise?\n \n \nApart from that, if the atf database can track a gun to its last known legal owner, then it actually serves a valuable purpose. Why would law-abiding citizens have a problem with the atf registering their gun?\n\n \n Because the ATF is a branch of the government; a branch with no oversight which has done many questionable things in the past, such as revoking an FFL license over the basis of abbreviations instead of writing things out long hand. Every agent has the ability to overrule the opinions of other agents, so even if they tell you something's alright, some other agent can determine that nothing's alright and reverse the previous decision, without notice. They're completely unchecked, they're bullies. They killed people at Waco and Ruby Ridge, including children.\n \n Add to that the fact that any centralized database maintained by the federal government would be illegal, under rules set forth by the 1986 GOPA.\n \n And then there's the fact that there's absolutely no way on earth that a centralized federal database could be usable. We've got nearly as many guns in this country as we do people; over 200 million and the number is continuing to grow.

   "Well unfortunately that's the problem. Any little concession we make, it's never enough. With every new law we allow to be passed somebody on the gun control side is like \"now that we got that law passed we're going to try for this one. Now that we got that one we've got another we want.\" And this just continues over and over and over again. Well I'm tired of it. We've given an ***load away, and what have we gotten back in return? Where are the concessions of the anti-gunners? What have they given up in the name of compromise?\n \n \n \n Because the ATF is a branch of the government; a branch with no oversight which has done many questionable things in the past, such as revoking an FFL license over the basis of abbreviations instead of writing things out long hand. Every agent has the ability to overrule the opinions of other agents, so even if they tell you something's alright, some other agent can determine that nothing's alright and reverse the previous decision, without notice. They're completely unchecked, they're bullies. They killed people at Waco and Ruby Ridge, including children.\n \n Add to that the fact that any centralized database maintained by the federal government would be illegal, under rules set forth by the 1986 GOPA.\n \n And then there's the fact that there's absolutely no way on earth that a centralized federal database could be usable. We've got nearly as many guns in this country as we do people; over 200 million and the number is continuing to grow. There's no way that a database with that many entries could be free from error, there would always be incorrect numbers to deal with. And to complicate that, requiring the police to sort through hundreds of millions of forms to find only one suspect would be a waste of valuable crime fighting resources and turn into nothing more than a giant money sinkhole.

And if you aren't prepared to fight them, your only choice is to serve them with unquestioning loyalty.\n\n \n Maybe we could get a compromise that those in favor of firearms registration have to pay a special fee. Its a fee and not a tax so its all above board. $100 to start sounds like a nice number. Just to cover administrative costs. Then if it gets into congress we could jump the fee to say $500. Just to pay all the lobbists and publicity and so forth. Of course by then you'd have to report to your local police with 4 or 5 passport sized photos to fill out the required form notifying the feds of your committment to registration. Of course there would be a fee involved to process your forms, fingerprints, notarized copies of your birth certificate or naturalization papers and the original of your social security card. This is just to prove who you say you are. All this paperwork is necessary so the government knows who to come after for the money involved to run the bureaucracy involved in registration. See the compromise is registration is not going to cost firearm owners any thing. Now since criminals can't be required to register their firearms, we need some more money to fight that hook before we can compell the law abiding to do any thing. Once you get all that done you pay the special fee of $1,000 to get it in the senate. But you are not finished there! There needs to be some sort of iron clad guarantee that registered fireams can never be declared illegal and confiscated. That one is going to be a hard one! ",

   "Unkerpaulie-\n \n I've read your proposal on what you feel to be a reasonable compromise on the Second Amendment and gun rights. Now I submit my rough draft proposal on what I would consider a reasonable compromise.\n \n 1. Repeal any and all import restriction on firearms, components and accessories.\n There's absolutely no point in not letting citizens buy foreign made guns that're comparable to ones they can buy locally made in America.\n \n 2. Repeal the restriction on civilian sales of brand new machine guns.\n Too few crimes are committed with legal machine guns to warrant the 1986 cut off date still being law.\n \n 3. Repeal the prohibition on the sale of new military surplus ammunition to civilians.\n It makes no sense to mandate that the military destroy surplus ammunition that can be used in commonly owned, civilian available firearms.\n \n 4. Repeal the \"sporting purpose\" clause and allow the unrestricted access of all non-automatic firearms that are classified as \"not sporting in nature\".\n Heller declared that the Second Amendment is directly connected to the defensive use of firearms, not sporting or hunting or anything else. Therefore limiting the importation/ownership of firearms that don't classify as sporting in nature is now pointless and irrelevant.\n \n 5. Repeal the Lautenburg Amendment.\n Too often vindictive spouses will make false claims of assault and abuse to spite their husband, and even with a lack of evidence the husband's Second Amendment rights are immediately ended without trial or due process. This isn't right and shouldn't be tolerated.\n \n 6. Update the NFA34 standards on \"short barreled rifles\" to declassify handguns with attached rifle-style buttstocks.\n It simply makes no sense to decide that a firearm registered as a handgun, is automatically considered a rifle with the inclusion of a single part.\n \n 7. Declassify handguns with attached forward grips as \"Any Other Weapons\".\n This restriction makes no sense at all.\n \n 8. Remove restriction on sound suppression devices.\n Mufflers are mandatory equipment on motor vehicles. Suppressors don't totally mute the sound of a gunshot, it won't make assassinations and crimes at night any easier to hide. Restrictions are pointless and the benefit of suppressors as training aids outweigh any potential impact they might have on crime.\n \n 9. Pass the BATFE Modernization and Reform Act.\n For too long the ATF has been abusing their powers and has been without oversight. It's time to reign them in and make them accountable like any other agency. They must be forced at the proverbial gun point to follow any and all regulations and restrictions on their powers, made accountable for every action and decision that they make. If they refuse then they lose federal funding for a minimum of one year.\n \n 10. Limited scope on firearms permits.\n If people insist that gun owners be licensed then there must be concessions on their parts. Anyone who applies for a permit must be made subject to one and only one background check for the duration of their life, after which they can buy as many guns as they want, anytime they want, from any state they want, with no further background checks because they went through the federal government.\n \n 11. Repeal DC's home rule.\n Washington DC has been openly disobeying the Heller ruling by continuing to enact their own gun control laws that're only minimally less restrictive than previous laws. As a federal enclave they must not be allowed to disregard the Constitution, and instead must be forced to obey only the federal laws already on the books and no others. They sold their home rule rights when they adopted the handgun rosters of states like California.\n \n 12. Mandatory pursuance of firearm crimes.\n All states must be required by law to pursue violations of federal firearms regulations. Gun charges may no longer be dropped or removed with a plea deal, but must instead be seen to the very end. Any state that refuses will lose all federal funding.\n \n 13. Mandatory punishment for firearms crimes.\n States may no longer be allowed to set their own standards for the punishment of firearms offenses, they must abide by federal standards or stricter. Mandatory five years in prison for being armed while committing a crime. Mandatory ten years in prison for gun traffickers, ten years for each and every gun linked to them. No parole, no probation, no plea deals. Any state that refuses will lose all federal funding.\n \n 14. Enact national right to carry reciprocity.\n A person's right to protect themselves shouldn't end at the state lines, regardless of what others may say. If certain states don't wish to abide by the same free exercise of the Second Amendment that other states do, then they must adopt resolutions to treat all other rights with the same callous disregard to ensure equality. They must also mandate that out of state driver's licenses are no good in their state.\n \n 15. Guaranteeing the rights of the people.\n Ratify a new constitutional amendment explicitly spelling out that no government in America may ever pass any law that would blanketly ban the ownership or purchase of any model firearm, component or ammunition.\n \n 16. Home rule for America.\n International law may no longer be cited or referred to when the discussion of how far a person's rights truly extend.\n \n 17. Repeal federal restriction on guns on and around campuses.\n Under current standards, being within 999 feet of a school while armed is a felony, punishable by five years in prison. Yet being 1,001 feet away from the same school, with the same weapon, is 100% legal. It makes absolutely no sense. Furthermore it's foolish to claim that a loaded gun, being less than 1,000 feet from a school, is somehow detrimental to a student's ability to freely learn and concentrate on their school work.\n \n That's all I can think of right now. I'll have more standards of what I consider a fair compromise later on.",

   " And how would a .... or sniper scope assist you in self defence? Should people own guns for offensive use as well? \n \n Now to the offensive part of your question.\n \n As you may know, the Revolutionary War started when the British came to both Lexington and Concord to seize the gun powder stores, collecting guns along the way. That was the final straw that broke our Founders backs! They would rather fight the most powerful army in the World rather then give up their means of self defense against the tyrannical government of King George! It was called the shot that was heard around the world. \n \n I know it seems impossible today, but our founders feared government, and even the very government they were in the process of creating. \n \n This is found at our National Archives.   The Bill of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution \n The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for, among old parchments, or musty records. They are written, as with a sun beam in the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself; and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power. --Alexander Hamilton 1775\n \n \n \n Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right to a fair and speedy trial&#8211;the ringing phrases that inventory some of Americans' most treasured personal freedoms&#8211;were not initially part of the U.S. Constitution. At the Constitutional Convention, the proposal to include a bill of rights was considered and defeated. The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution as the first ten amendments on December 15, 1791.\n \n The fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process. To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable. Throughout the ratification process, individuals and state ratification conventions called for the adoption of a bill of rights.\n\n This theme can also be seen in the Preamble to the Bill of Rights. \n   Preamble Bill of Rights \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution \n\n Note especially the wording of the 9th and 10th amendments. \nAmendment IX\n \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n Amendment X\n \n The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n Our Founding Fathers set up a system of checks and balances with the three branches of government serving as a check on the other, with the final check on a rogue government being the armed citizen themselves. \n   FEDERALIST No. 28 HAMILTON \n If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that \n  original right of self-defense \n which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. \n In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense. \n  The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair. \n The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo.\n \n The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state, provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them. The natural strength of the people in a large community, in proportion to the artificial strength of the government, is greater than in a small, and of course more competent to a struggle with the attempts of the government to establish a tyranny. \n\n \n However, even in a peaceful Well Regulated, (meaning working properly) government, the Militia serves as the backbone to defend our Nation. \n \n   Who are the Militia today \n \n \n United States Code, Title 10 Chapter 13.\n \n (a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard. \n \n (b) The classes of the militia are &#8211; Organized and unorganized\n \n (1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard \n and the Naval Militia; and \n \n  (2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.  \n\n This is the true setting on the 2nd Amendment.\n \n\"Whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them; nor does it follow from this, that all promiscuously must go into actual service on every occasion. The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it.\"\n \n , The Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.\n\n \n And thus a new Republic was founded.",

   "You guys obviously have a lot more knowledge on the subject than I do. I never knew that it was that much trouble to buy a gun. And solely for the purpose of target practice? That's retarded, and backwards.\n\n \n That's New York for you. And despite all of that, some politicians are claiming that it's still far too easy for just anyone in New York to get a handgun, that it's too easy for criminals to get guns and use them, so they propose new and stricter laws, stricter than anything seen before.\n \n And to think, it all started out with the passage of a law designed to keep italians and other immigrants from owning a gun within New York state limits. Can you see how quickly things spiral out of control if you don't take a stand a declare \"no more\"?\n \n \nThat's probably the point of the laws; don't ban them, just make them ridiculously complicated to legally own.\n\n \n Another reason we want a repeal of so many laws. They run afoul of the constitution, but they're not illegal due to a technicality amounting to no more substance than the width of a human hair.\n \n \nAs for your list of gun law repeals and changes, I agree with some of them, but not all. The question in my mind is: should gun ownership be for personal defense, or for whatever the owner wants to do with them? Because beyond, hunting, sport and personal defense, what are people using their guns for?\n \n \n The Heller ruling handed down by the Supreme Court specifically spelled out that the Second Amendment is tied to personal defense, meaning that limiting people to only sporting weapons should now be illegal. However the exercise of the KBA provision is tied to any and all lawful uses. That includes hunting, sports, recreation and such. But the makeup of shooting sports is constantly changing and evolving, the application for new weapons is always growing, and some of these things classified as \"destructive devices\" by the ATF would fit those sports very well. Just because something is deemed to have no sporting value because it was literally too heavy, doesn't mean people shouldn't have access to it.\n \n \nHow would an assault rifle be a better choice of weapon on your person, in your car or in your room, than a hand gun?\n \n \n Easier to aim, easier to learn on, proportionally less recoil, easier to mount various sights for maximizing accuracy, more potential for stopping a gremlin that's high on PCP or some other illegal substance.\n \n I'd have to look for it, but I remember reading a story of a suspect that was shot 19 times by a police officer, in the center of mass, and he still didn't drop for several minutes, he just remained vertical and kept on moving.\n \n Another reason the rifle is a better choice is because of body armor. Criminals are increasingly using body armor in the commission of their crimes, rendering them largely invulnerable to handgun and even shotgun rounds. It's reasons like this the police are being issued AR-15s. It's reasons like this that I believe the civilian access to similar weapons of comparable performance is essential to our safety. It takes too long for the police to arrive at the scene, and by the time they get there it's usually too late to do anything except mark the chalk line around the victim's body. \n \n \nAnd how would a silencer or sniper scope assist you in self defence?\n\n \n For starters, a sniper scope has very little differences from a standard hunting scope.\n \n As for the suppressor, it would aid in self-defense for when you have to discharge a firearm inside your own home. The explosive volume of a round being discharged in confined and enclosed surroundings is enough to render a person deaf even after just one shot if they have no hearing protection. I don't think that's right, I don't think it should be acceptable.\n \n \nShould people own guns for offensive use as well?\n\n \n I'm gonna wait for what your definition of \"offensive use\" is. Everybody has a different standard, and I wanna find out yours before I address it.\n \n \nJust as an aside, I know how emotional some people get about this topic, but please chill with the flames and snide comments. I'm not attacking anybody's position, I'm asking honest questions because like I said, I'm speaking from more of a common sense approach than from a position of extensive knowledge on the subject. Thanks.\n\n \n I'll try and keep that in mind. It's rare to find a beginner on these forums.\n \n One of the biggest problems we have with the suggestion of compromise and middle ground, is that the gun control side is always the one doing all the talking. They tell us what they consider to be \"reasonable, common sense, meaningful\" restrictions, and they're always anything but. These people are the ones who're relatively safe, spending all their times in office buildings, in elite neighborhoods, always having access to armed bodyguards that carry brand new machine guns for their own private protection. They have no real world experience, they don't know what people like you, me and the guy down the block go through. Their elitism has clouded their view, they shouldn't have a say in the matter.\n \n Instead I want to be hearing from the single mother with three kids who owns a gun because her exhusband has repeatedly threatened to kill her. I wanna hear from the patrol officers in law enforcement who see how the laws fail and innocent people get hurt. I wanna hear from those who believe in a true balance between freedom and security, and those who're more focused on taking criminals off the streets and out of society, instead of those who would rather leave the criminals on the streets and simply remove the guns from the picture; as if it were even a possibility.",

If it has no benefit in prevention of crime, doesn't deter crime and is of questional value in solving crime it doesn't sound like a common sense approach to me. \n \n The very term \"assault rifle\" is a term made up by the slavers to scare people. You get the really stupid bleats like you don't need an AK 47 to hunt deer from the uneducated. For personal defense it is a matter of choice for the individual. Most modern construction is of plaster board and studs. Given the penetration of most rifles and pistols unless you are using frangible bullet that break apart on impact, you have a real danger of shooting through walls and hitting an unintended target. A short barreled pump action shotgun with #4 or 5 shot would be my personal choice. Most people recognize the distinctive clack clack of a pump chambering a shell. This tends to scare off most home intruders without firing a shot. ",

   "From my layman point of veiw, I think that gun ownership should be a matter of self defense first, and of forming a grassroots militia a distant second. Yes, its constitutionally endorsed, but I don't see it as very practical. In the unlikely event that some form of mass homeland invasion takes place, or the government is overthrown by tyrants, or something like that, then once the army is no longer effective then by all means the armed public needs to take a stance, if they can. But generally speaking, gun ownership should be foremost for the purpose of defending one's life, family and property from those who would try to use hostile means to take them from us. \n \n What other need is there for one to own a gun? I asked the question whether guns should be owned for offensive use. If I use my gun to shoot someone that isn't posing an immediate threat to me, that's offensive use. If I go hunting, that's offensive use (even though its not targeting people). If I go to a battle zone to confront an oncoming army, that's offensive use. As long as it isn't a case where someone approaches me first to cause harm, and get shot as a result, if I'm the one initiating the confrontation, while armed, then I'm using my gun offensively. \n \n So for people who wish to use their guns offensively against other people, should the law allow this?\n \n If this is the case, then laws should be formed with this vision and objective in mind. \n \n The problem is mistrust. On both sides. The public cannot trust the government with all the armed power and they with none. The government cannot trust the public armed power and their intentions in privacy. And both have legitimate reasons to mistrust each other, because we have cases where both cases have led to disaster. \n \n You guys have a lot of solid arguments why the public should be armed, both for safety from the public and safety from the government. But put yourselves in the government's shoes for a moment. Would you really want a public with an armed force of unknown size, strength, mobilty, location, organizational structure and intention anywhere in your country? What's to stop a charismatic visionary individual from organizing a large organization of armed homeowners, who would like to seize the power they believe they deserve, from overrunning the white house on any given tuesday? One minute our intrepid grassroots leader is promising us free cable and cheesy fries for everybody, (and the american population swoons over him like sheep), next minute we're sitting under the biggest tyrant imaginable. Kinda like lots of countries under dictatorship. Then armed bandits jumping out of alleys would be but a minor inconvenience. \n \n I don't want either scenario. Everybody is just seeking their own interests. Who should decide where the compromise should lie?",

   "From my layman point of veiw, I think that gun ownership should be a matter of self defense first, and of forming a grassroots militia a distant second. Yes, its constitutionally endorsed, but I don't see it as very practical.\n\n \n Currently in the middle east, in the \"war on terror\" we're fighting on multiple fronts, across various countries, one of the greatest threats we're dealing with are insurgents. These are largely untrained civilians, equipped with military hardware and improvised explosive devices, who could be absolutely anybody in any given crowd.\n \n If insurgents are causing as much trouble as they are in the middle east, if war were declared on the American people by our own government, things could be so much worse, because we're a more advanced country. The people here have access to greater hardware, and they don't fear pig fat. We've been pushed for decades, and one of these days we're gonna get pushed one time too many and it's gonna be one massive snap. When we fight back we'd likely make the middle east insurgents look like a bunch a bunch of kindergarten kids. \n \n \nWhat other need is there for one to own a gun? I asked the question whether guns should be owned for offensive use. If I use my gun to shoot someone that isn't posing an immediate threat to me, that's offensive use.

If you shoot someone who isn't posing an immediate threat to you, but you have absolutely every reason to assume that they're about to cause harm to a third party in the area, did you just assault that person with offensive use of a firearm, or did you defend a potential victim from harm?\n \n \nYou guys have a lot of solid arguments why the public should be armed, both for safety from the public and safety from the government. But put yourselves in the government's shoes for a moment. Would you really want a public with an armed force of unknown size, strength, mobilty, location, organizational structure and intention anywhere in your country?\n\n \n If I were a government official who was more concerned with maintaining my own power than doing what was best for those who elected me, then of course I wouldn't want a force of unknown levels to be building against me as it would threaten my position and authority.\n \n If the government is so afraid of the people being armed, that it's trying to disarm them, then they're no longer focused on the best interests for the people and the country they swore an oath to. In a situation like this the government is more interested in protecting itself and maintaining its own power through whatever means. And once you get to that point, it's high time necessary to reform them and teach them their proper place.\n \n \nWhat's to stop a charismatic visionary individual from organizing a large organization of armed homeowners, who would like to seize the power they believe they deserve, from overrunning the white house on any given tuesday?\n\n \n What's to stop it from happening even in countries like Britain, Japan and Australia where gun control is near absolute and the government has the people on a very short leash?\n \n come to think of it, what is stopping it right now?\n \n \nOne minute our intrepid grassroots leader is promising us free cable and cheesy fries for everybody, (and the american population swoons over him like sheep), next minute we're sitting under the biggest tyrant imaginable. Kinda like lots of countries under dictatorship. \n\n \n It already happened. Look at our current president. He promised hope and change and \"yes we can!\" and instead he's given us czars that report to him and only him, and he's nominating people who have an interest in globalization more than what's best for the company. He's got people who cite international law for setting American policy.\n \n \nI don't want either scenario. Everybody is just seeking their own interests. Who should decide where the compromise should lie?\n\n \n Those of us who're most often abused and targeted. The government is elected by us, they get paid with our tax dollars, making them our grunt employees. As the employers we should be allowed to tell them exactly what they'll do, and exactly when they're going to do it. If they don't like it then get another line of work or leave the country and go to some socialist nation.",

   "From my layman point of veiw, I think that gun ownership should be a matter of self defense first, and of forming a grassroots militia a distant second. \n\n No one is talking about a grassroots militia. I just quoted who and what are bound by law to serve if called. That Federal law is where the U.S. government gets the authority to call whom ever is needed, when needed, like the State Guards that have been called up to serve both in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are all obligated, weather one wants to serve or not, weather one in in the Armed forces or not. Anti-gunners too. \n \n \nSo for people who wish to use their guns offensively against other people, should the law allow this?\n\n You lost me there. It almost sounds like you are speaking of murder! There are laws against offensive uses if this is what you are talking about! To include overthrowing a Government! Again, I just gave you what was in the minds of our Founders when they wrote the Constitution. They not only thought along the lines of over throwing their government, to them it was a reality, and the government they set up, was with sufficient Checks and Balances in the hopes we would never have to do it every again. \n \n Our Founders set this country up so that We the People are the ONLY owners of this country, and Government serves us, or We the People. We are the Government and they are us. That is supposed to work. Everyone is to follow the law and the Constitution. If both Government and We the People do so, then everything works as planned! However Government is not above the law and the Constitution, nor are they ever above us. Our Public servants would do well to remember this from time to time, as it benefits the Republic.\n \n However, there are millions of rounds shot every day for target shooting, to include things like trap, skeet, sporting clays, and all sorts of rifle and pistol competitions and practice. Most guns will never be fired in defense of ones self or used in a crime. Most firearms are used in a responsible way, so I don't quite get your offensive referencing.\n \n Less then one percent are ever used in a crime as well.",
