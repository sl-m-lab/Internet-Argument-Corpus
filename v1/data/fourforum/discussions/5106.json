This IS civility and legislation action at its best.\n\n \n The right to stand you ground and exercise self-defense without having to first \"retreat to the wall\" has been the law in my Commonwealth of Virginia for more than 200 years (see the thread \"the natural right of self defense and the use of deadly force in Virginia). Florida is merely returning to the old and well-tested common-law right, which was apparently restricted by a previous statute. We have no Dirty Harry wannabes shooting people in our streets, and you will not find them in Florida either. Self-defense is always a right which carries great responsibility. Nothing in the Florida law changes the reality that if you use deadly force without justification you would be guilty of murder/manslaughter/wounding. I witnessed a big three news network story on the Florida law change, where the reporter sounded amazed that people who use deadly force and claim self-defense will be \"presumed innocent\" by the new law. Last I checked, the presumption of innocence is still a bedrock theory of our criminal law, and the presumption applies to everyone charged with any crime in America. I see no reason why the Florida gun law should be any different.",

This to me is not an unconstitutional infringement on the RKBA. \n \n The laws for restoring civil rights for felons vary from state to state. Virginia deals with it in this fashion---Violent felons (murder/rape/robbery/malicious wounding/etc) are forever barred from reclaiming either their right to vote or their RKBA. Non violent felons: \n \n \"may petition the circuit court of the county or city in which he was convicted of a felony, or the circuit court of the county or city in which he presently resides, for restoration of his civil right to be eligible to register to vote through the process set out in this section. On such petition, the court may approve the petition for restoration to the person of his right if the court is satisfied from the evidence presented that the petitioner has completed, five or more years previously, service of any sentence and any modification of sentence including probation, parole, and suspension of sentence; that the petitioner has demonstrated civic responsibility through community or comparable service; and that the petitioner has been free from criminal convictions, excluding traffic infractions, for the same period.\n If the court approves the petition, it shall so state in an order, provide a copy of the order to the petitioner, and transmit its order to the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The order shall state that the petitioner's right to be eligible to register to vote may be restored by the date that is 90 days after the date of the order, subject to the approval or denial of restoration of that right by the Governor. The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall transmit the order to the Governor who may grant or deny the petition for restoration of the right to be eligible to register to vote approved by the court order. The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall send, within 90 days of the date of the order, to the petitioner at the address stated on the court's order, a certificate of restoration of that right or notice that the Governor has denied the restoration of that right. The Governor's denial of a petition for the restoration of voting rights shall be a final decision and the petitioner shall have no right of appeal. The Secretary shall notify the court and the State Board of Elections in each case of the restoration of the right or denial of restoration by the Governor.\n On receipt of the certificate of restoration of the right to register to vote from the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the petitioner, who is otherwise a qualified voter, shall become eligible to register to vote.\" Virginia Code \u00a7 53.1-231.2\n \n Once you have your right to vote restored, then you can petition for a RKBA again:\n \n \"Any person prohibited from possessing, transporting or carrying a firearm, explosive material, stun weapon or taser under subsection A [convicted felons], may petition the circuit court of the jurisdiction in which he resides for a permit to possess or carry a firearm, explosive material, stun weapon or taser; however, no person who has been convicted of a felony shall be qualified to petition for such a permit unless his civil rights have been restored by the Governor or other appropriate authority. The court may, in its discretion and for good cause shown, grant such petition and issue a permit.\" Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2\n \n BTW, in addition to prohibiting firearms possession, Virginia also denies possession to felons of \"explosive material,\" which is defined as \"any chemical compound mixture, or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to function by explosion; the term includes, but is not limited to, dynamite and other high explosives, black powder, pellet powder, smokeless gun powder, detonators, blasting caps and detonating cord but shall not include fireworks or permissible fireworks [under another code section listing permissible fireworks].\" This definition includes ammunition in the ban.

   "Here is the text of the new Florida Self-defense act. It consists of four separate statutes. Two of which were newly created, and two of which were amended. The act starts with a preamble, and then each statute is listed by a separate section. The new laws take effect 10/1/05, and I would expect jury instructions will have to be modified to account for the new changes. \n \n NOTE: for the two statutes which were already in existence, the amendments both added to and struck out language. Words underlined denote language added to the statute, and words italicized denote deletions from the statute.\n \n -------------\n \n WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that it is proper for law-abiding people to protect themselves, their families, and others from intruders and attackers without fear of prosecution or civil action for acting in defense of themselves and others, and \n WHEREAS, the castle doctrine is a common-law doctrine of ancient origins which declares that a person's home is his or her castle, and\n WHEREAS, Section 8 of Article I of the State Constitution guarantees the right of the people to bear arms in defense of themselves, and\n WHEREAS, the persons residing in or visiting this state have a right to expect to remain unmolested within their homes or vehicles, and\n WHEREAS, no person or victim of crime should be required to surrender his or her personal safety to a criminal, nor should a person or victim be required to needlessly retreat in the face of intrusion or attack, \n \n NOW, THEREFORE, Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:\n \n Section 1. Section 776.013, Florida Statutes, is created  to read:\n 776.013 Home protection; use of deadly force; presumption of fear of death or great bodily harm.--\n \n (1) A person is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another when using defensive force that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if:\n (a) The person against whom the defensive force was used was in the process of unlawfully and forcefully entering, or had unlawfully and forcibly entered, a dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle, or if that person had removed or was attempting to remove another against that person's will from the dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle; and (b) The person who uses defensive force knew or had reason to believe that an unlawful and forcible entry or unlawful and forcible act was occurring or had occurred.\n (2) The presumption set forth in subsection (1) does not apply if:\n (a) The person against whom the defensive force is used has the right to be in or is a lawful resident of the dwelling, residence, or vehicle, such as an owner, lessee, or titleholder, and there is not an injunction for protection from domestic violence or a written pretrial supervision order of no contact against that person; or (b) The person or persons sought to be removed is a child or grandchild, or is otherwise in the lawful custody or under the lawful guardianship of, the person against whom the defensive force is used; or (c) The person who uses defensive force is engaged in an unlawful activity or is using the dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle to further an unlawful activity; or (d) The person against whom the defensive force is used is a law enforcement officer, as defined in s.1 943.10(14), who enters or attempts to enter a dwelling, residence, or vehicle in the performance of his or her official duties and the officer identified himself or herself in accordance with any applicable law or the person using force knew or reasonably should have known that the person entering or attempting to enter was a law enforcement officer. \n (3) A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.\n (4) A person who unlawfully and by force enters or attempts to enter a person's dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle is presumed to be doing so with the intent to commit an unlawful act involving force or violence.\n (5) As used in this section, the term:\n (a) \"Dwelling\" means a building or conveyance of any kind, including any attached porch, whether the building or conveyance is temporary or permanent, mobile or immobile, which has a roof over it, including a tent, and is designed to be occupied by people lodging therein at night. (b) \"Residence\" means a dwelling in which a person\n resides either temporarily or permanently or is visiting as an invited guest. (c) \"Vehicle\" means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, which is designed to transport people or property.\n \n Section 2. Section 776.012, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:\n \n 776.012 Use of force in defense of person.--A person is justified in using the use of  force, except deadly force, against another when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself or herself or another against the such other's imminent use of unlawful force. However, a the person is justified in the use of deadly force and does not have a duty to retreat  only if:\n (a) He or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony; or.(b) Under those circumstances permitted pursuant to s.776.013.\n \n Section 3. Section 776.031, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:\n \n 776.031 Use of force in defense of others.--A person is justified in the use of force, except deadly force, against another when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to prevent or terminate the such other's trespass on, or other tortious or criminal interference with, either real property other than a dwelling or personal property, lawfully in his or her possession or in the possession of another who is a member of his or her immediate family or household or of a person whose property he or she has a legal duty to protect. However, the person is justified in the use of deadly force only if he or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony. A person does not have a duty to retreat if the person is in a place where he or she has a right to be.\n \n Section 4. Section 776.032, Florida Statutes, is created to read:\n \n 776.032 Immunity from criminal prosecution and civil action for justifiable use of force.--(1) A person who uses force as permitted in s.776.012, s. 776.013, or s. 776.031 is justified in using such force and is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action for the use of such force, unless the person against whom force was used is a law enforcement officer, as defined in s.943.10(14), who was acting in the performance of his or her official duties and the officer identified himself or herself in accordance with any applicable law or the person using force knew or reasonably should have known that the person was a law enforcement officer. As used in this subsection, the term \"criminal prosecution\" includes arresting, detaining in custody, and charging or prosecuting the defendant. \n (2) A law enforcement agency may use standard procedures for investigating the use of force as described in subsection (1), but the agency may not arrest the person for using force unless it determines that there is probable cause that the force that was used was unlawful. \n (3) The court shall award reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, compensation for loss of income, and all expenses incurred by the defendant in defense of any civil action brought by a plaintiff if the court finds that the defendant is immune from prosecution as provided in subsection (1).",

If you use lethal force in self defense, all you have to do is demonstrate that fleeing was not a safe option. Before, you had to make a demonstrable attempt to flee. That requirement is gone.

   "I know. And I agree. If you use lethal force in self defense, all you have to do is demonstrate that fleeing was not a safe option. Before, you had to make a demonstrable attempt to flee. That requirement is gone. Now, if you feel it safer to use lethal force, then you can make that choice without being penalised.\n \n But if an opportunity to flee presents itself, and you choose to stay 'at the party' so to speak, and you then kill someone, you are going to have some very serious questions to answer.

In Florida, the carrying of a concealed weapon is very legal. In fact, Florida has recently relaxed the rules to allow more law-abiding people the right to carry concealed weapons. Crime is pandemic in many areas of Florida and people are tired of being victims of crime. There is NO REQUIREMENT to retreat, attempt to retreat or even contemplate retreat in the Florida law. It states that if threatened with substantial harm, you can stand your ground and blow the ****er's head off. It can't be made any plainer than that for you.\n Now, I know it's hard for someone from OZ to understand the concept of self-defense since your nanny government neutered the legal population in respect to gun ownership, but that isn't the case here. We can own guns, we can carry guns and we can use guns to defend person and property. If a perp pulls a knife and demands your wallet, you can reach in your pocket and pull out a S&W, instead of your wallet, and inflict an acute case of lead poisoning on the criminal without fear of criminal prosecution OR civil lawsuit from the deceased perp's family.",

In my state, according to public safety officers, street cops and the sheriff, and my lawyer, lethal force as a defense is permitted in the event one's life or the lives of one's family are threatened. Boiled down to reality, in my home on an uninvited basis (removes the issue or armed or not), or in a public place.

If a weapon is displayed and the assailant is advancing on me and brandishing the weapon, I shoot him/her. Crime scenes even without witnesses are as readable as a book to experienced investigators.\n\n \n The changes in Florida's law are not radical or extreme. The significant revisions are setting forth situations where use of deadly force was presumed justifiable, and in making it clear that you have no duty to retreat prior to exercising your right of self-defense if you are engaged in lawful conduct when threatened. The bottom line is that criminals no longer have the right to make you run away before you can exercise self-defense. This appears to apply to all self-defense cases, and not just those that involve deadly force. Removing the duty to retreat does not, in my opinion, eliminate the possibility of retreat from consideration. If retreat was a safe option, then that would probably remain a factor for a jury to consider when it weighed whether you reasonably believed the use of deadly force was necessary under the circumstances. \n \n The law of self defense remains the \"law of necessity,\" however, and the critical issue is what was going on in the mind of the person who claims he acted in self defense. When you claim self defense you bear the burden of showing that you reasonably believed that acting in self defense was necessary to end the threat. Also, the amount of force used in self-defense must be rationally related to the threatened harm. To justify the use of deadly force in self defense, Florida requires that the nature of the threat must be the \"imminent\" commission of a \"forcible felony.\" The term \"forcible felony\" is not defined in the new act, and presumably it is defined elsewhere in the Florida code. At a minimum, however, it will likely include defending oneself from crimes of attempted murder, wounding, rape, robbery, carjacking, etc. \n \n By comparison, Virginia's rule on when deadly force is justified in self-defense is included in the following jury instruction: \n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the amount of force used in self-defense must be reasonable in relation to the harm threatened, and that the defendant is not allowed to use deadly force in self- defense unless he reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of being killed or that he was in danger of great bodily harm.\n \n Remember that when jury members are called upon to judge whether you reasonably feared a threat requiring defense by deadly force they are sitting in a comfortable air-conditioned room with hours of time to contemplate what you had to decide in seconds while under a tremendous amount of stress. Having said this, however, in my experience jurors give a lot of leeway to the one acting in self-defense, particularly if they get the sense that the \"victim\" of your use of deadly force was in the wrong and therefore deserved to get a bad case of lead poisoning. Problems only arise in self-defense claims when people act with malice, then falsely claim self-defense, only to have the evidence contradict their claim. For example, you claim you shot someone in self-defense, but the blood spatter evidence and chips in the concrete under his body show you stood over him and shot him 4 times while he was lying down; OR you shoot him outside the house to recover your DVD player, then drag him back into the house, put a kitchen knife in his hand, and then claim you shot him as he attacked you in your bedroom, only to have the medical examiner find dirt up his nose from where you dragged him through the flower bed; OR you are legitimately threatened at a party by a man wielding a ball bat, so you leave the party, drive home, get your gun, come back to the party, shoot the man, and then claim self-defense. If these are your facts, then you've got problems coming. \n \n Most true self-defense cases never make it into court. The reason is you don't have a complainant demanding that you to be arrested for what you did. Unless the \"victim\" of your use of force in self-defense truly believes he was in the right and has nothing to fear by reporting what he did to the police, you will never see a complaint about what you did in self-defense. Brandishing a firearm with the intent to cause another to fear they are about to get shot remains a crime, but I have never seen a robber or a rapist call the police to complain that their victim brandished a gun and scared them off (and if they did, acting in self-defense is a legal defense to this crime as well). Now if you wound a true criminal (be it a robber, rapist, carjacker, etc), then the police will likely get involved when the hospital reports him as presenting with a gunshot wound. In my experience, however, these guys never want to admit what they were doing that caused them to get shot, and they always lie about how it happened (\"I was just walking down the street and these dudes in a white car shot me\" being a typical lie). If you report your use of force to defend yourself, and he is later identified as your wounded attacker, he may (and often does) change his story to say he was shot by you, but he was doing nothing wrong and you shot him for no good reason. You never get charged with this because no one believes his new version of the truth. This is how self-defense cases work in the real world.",
