   "SOL is \"XXXX out of luck\".\n \n The pawn shop is required to do a background check... by LAW!! As if you went to a gun store an attempted to buy a gun. Same exact rules.\n \n Am I entitled to any compensation for my property? I pawned this gun thinking I would have no problem getting it back. SURPRISE!!\n \n I'm still trying to find out what I did that would cause this problem. Getting any information is another bureaucratic nightmare. Nobody will tell you anything. I'm now being asked to be re-fingerprinted, buy a money order for $18.00, and submit another request to the FBI/NCIC in Clarksburg, W. Virginia. This is just to find out what they are holding against me.\n \n \n Giseuda",

   "Tim,\n \n Thanks, that was an interesting thread.\n \n I too, have had fingerprints taken in the military for security clearance, and on various other occasions in my life. I'm 52 years old. I was not an angel but never a criminal.\n \n The difference in my situation is that I 've been turned down after an appeal. The FBI/NCIC has my name and fingerprints tied to a crime. Ridiculous as it may sound, I don't have any clue as to what it was. I'm doing my damndest to find out now.\n \n My advice: Never, ever, pawn a firearm. Believe me, it ain't worth it.\n \n Giseuda",
