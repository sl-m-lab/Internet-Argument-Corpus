For the sake of argument, this really isn't a proven fact.\n For all one knows, having the ceremony of 'pie in the face' pleases God and gets you an automatic pass into heaven.\n As such, it pays to put pies in the faces of as many as you can, particularly those you love.\n \n \nThe reason I bring this up is that my neice (my sister-in-law's daughter from a relationship previous to her marrying my brother - I still consider the girl my neice) is getting confirmed this weekend.

If one is upset at some rediculous practice, then they can stuff it.\n As is said. No religious school 'forces' a non-believer to comply with rites and passages. They will ask the student to be passive and not an interruption.\n That's standard Catholicism AS well as applies to most fundy schools.\n They want PAYING parents to bring their kids to the school.\n \n THAT said, a PRACTICING parent who has a BELIEVING child who goes through the functions OFTEN gets a DISCOUNT on tuition.\n Thus, it pays to be a believer or even to 'fake it'.\n (this lesson brought to you be Zardoz)\n \n If you're opposed to the practice, then don't attend.\n BUT, you could still get her a gift for 'enduring the ordeal'. that would show her that you loved her and was sympathetic to her suffering.\n \n BTW, I'm St. Justin (for confirmation) and have thought of continuing the charade to ensure my Son (whom I have absolute control of) can go to the local Catholic school for 6-8th grade rather than the local middle school when he graduates from elementary this year.\n He was previously in an evangelistic style school...until they proved to be the suxors and came <.< this close to being sued to death.

   "She shouldn't be forced to get confirmed or baptized just to pass a class. That is totally unethical.\n\n Private education can make all sorts of requirements they want.\n You'd have no problems if it were 'evangelical'.\n The evangelical school my kids attended had some requirements that were't academically related as a requirement to graduate.\n My eldest son graduated there.\n \n \nAnd her guardians should have the gumption to challenge such a policy of forced acceptance of something she doesn't personally believe or accept.\n\n I believe Jito is obsfucating some here.\n It sounds like the child's parents are divorced and have differing ideas in regards to the child with the father bein Catholic and the mother not.\n The father is providing for the child's education. He had her christened as an infant also.\n As I stated, more often than not, religious schools give an 'in-state' discount to believers and outsiders have to pay full price tuition. Thus, this child going through those little 'pintless' ceremonies could save the father thousands. \n \n \nHow old is she jito? Not that it matters. At any age it is coercion and therefore immoral.\n\n Confirmation is around 11-13ish IIRC. About 6th grade.\n You'd also change your tune if it were both parents behind the activity.\n Think, if you had a 12 year old snot nosed kid telling you they weren't going to church but were going to play pagan in the nakey out in the woods...would you seriously let them?\n Very few parents would put up with that until a few years later...when they're close to the 'Get the hell outta my house' stage.\n \n Courts would support these practices and in the case of this division, odds are legal rulings would favor the father.\n If the mother also wanted to indoctrinate the kid into competing beliefs...she'd also be supported more often than not by courts.\n \n What I 'smell' here is a double standard by Jito.\n An inbuilt belief that the mother is always right in child rearing issues and that the sister-in-law being more family/friend related than the 'ex' she'd have an emotional interest in the case.\n As I pointed out, Jito normially supports indoctrinating one's own kids...but in this particular case seems to be stating the oposite.\n \n \n My suggestion not to attend (unless Jito can be political) but to be supportive of the child afterwards would probably be best.\n This is also a learning lesson on how to engage in realpolitic and go through a basically meaningless ceremony to apease her father (and later in life, others). One should learn when and what battles to fight. \n They could even make up a 'washing off' ceremony to unconfrim her later.\n Maybe a girly-girly 'No man is the boss of me' dance and song of independence and self determination. \n \n Whatever is done, the girl should not be turned against her father as that IS a diagnosed form of child abuse. The same is also true if the roles were reversed.\n I'm also curious as to exactly why the girl wouldn't want to go through this ceremony. Most children at this age DON'T have their own opinions on such subjects and would merely go through the motions.\n IMO, she's probably torn by her parents seperation and caught in the middle.\n Wanting to follow mom...but being 'stuck' with dad. Not a mentally healthy position.\n I'd initially recommend the girl to talk to a counselor if this seems to be a serious problem. I'm not there though. And also note, that a competant professional would cut through BS and could see the mother at fault here...or even the father.\n But from personal experience, down playing rather than getting upset would have been the best course of action.\n \n \n Since the child is being confirmed, it's clear that she's already had 1st Communion (~3rd grade) and more than likely has participated in CONFESSION as well as receiving the HOST during WEEKLY Mass (which happens at school).\n I'd also like to know what's going on with that clearly more pronounced issue?\n And if you mixed up confirmation with communion...for SHAME.\n Learn thy religions!\n That way you can successfully rant against them.",

Being expelled from public schools for some infraction or another or, the parents not caring for the ghetto appeal many schools end up being...things like that.\n In some areas, 'alternative public education' is not available like it would be in say Houston TX.

Be they heathens or uppity heretics or even people we just didn't want in our club. Yeah, we'd kill ya. As a matter of fact, I'm enlisted in Gods Holy army right now. \n One of the cool things about being a Catholic is we can also drink and gamble.

All I got here is a semi-automatic but, at least you get to go first.'\n \n Plus, we lay pretty good guilt trips.\n Get to engage in irresponsible sex.\n And not have to listen to women mouth off from a fricken Pulpit.\n I mean, we get that enough at home. \n Not saying that listening to a man who's got like a 50% chance of being gay is any better but his vocal tones don't grate on the nerves as bad...and they serve booze at church to take the edge off.\n We also have basins full of magic water you can use to fight off vampires...although, come to think of it, transubstantiation would make Catholics the only 'vampires' encountered in real life. \n \n Well, last survey I read is that Catholics have the best sex life.\n I'd say that's a plus.\n \n But, yeah, free booze.

   "For what it's worth, I take Richard Dawkins' idea seriously, that teaching a child some religion or other is absolute truth is child abuse. While I realise parents do not do take this point of view, there is some truth to it. There is no such thing as \"a Christian child\", or \"a Muslim child\". There is only a child whose parents are Christian or Muslim. Children do not know enough to make those sorts of choices, and painting them with the religion of their parents seems to me to be unfair at the very least.\n \n Children unquestioningly absorb the beliefs of their parents. There is probably a sound evolutionary reason for their gullibility, because their parents are survivors in the evolutionary wars, therefore their beliefs would seem conducive to survival. But contrary to common supposition, religion isn't really about eternal verities. It's about social cohesion. It can be successful without being true.\n \n Children should be set free to seek truth, even if truth is an elusive goal. Any religion or philosophy may encapsulate some aspect of truth, or provide some shade on meaningfulness, but it isn't going to provide absolute truth, because religion is a human-made invention.",

   "It would be interesting to see some (unbiased) studies on this. I suspect people would generally look for truth in other ways if raised completely sterile of any known organized religion, and would therefore, in a sense, make a religion out of things more empirical. They'd probably just grow up learning to religiously believe other things--such as that religion itself was bunk (if that's what their parents taught them), and may even make a cult-like following of that way of thinking as I've seen in some posters here. After all, there are several posters here who are downright religious and cult-like in the way they oppose religion, and seem just as evangelistic and fundamentalist here in that way of thinking as religious people on the far opposite side of spectrum.\n\n \n Tell us do... were you a \"Christian child\"? Do you believe in Christianity because you have evaluated all alternatives objectively and decided Christianity is the only real view, or do you believe because it's what your parents taught you to believe? Are you just a cult follower because you were brought up in a cult? That is true of the vast majority of Christians, or believers in other faiths. They believe what they were taught to believe.\n \n And no, dear heart, I was not brought up to believe religion was bunk. I learned that the hard way, through intellectual perseverance and effort. You are the cult follower; I reject your cult.",

   "I was under the impression that non-Catholics could attend Catholic schools without being compelled to adopt Catholicism. Where is this school?\n \n Btw I haven't baptized my children because I feel as you do. That and the fact that I refuse to make the pledge required as I am not a believer. My family remains staunchly Catholic. In fact I have had no talks about religion or God with my elder child who is approaching 5 yrs. old. It's a little experiment I'm conducting to see how likely belief in God will be for him if he recieves no early indoctrination. He has already come home from preschool telling me that so and so said, \"God created the world\". He tells me,\"So and so is wrong though. Actually Dad, space created the world.\"\n\n \n Interesting experiment, sinjin. I personally believe religious studies should not begin until young adulthood. Now that the pope has assured us that unbaptized babies are not in fact burning in hell, I think we should stretch the boundaries a bit. In a few years the pope will be in full agreement.\n \n Did you inquire further about what Number 1 son meant when he said the earth was made from space?",

   "She is 13. Both her parents come from Catholic families, neither practice, go to church, etc. Her father is so Catholic that he got maried in a Lutheran church.\n\n Sounds like residual indictrination. Hard to shake cradle-based christianity...nor the tendency for hypocracy. Most such practices are typical from my obserbvations on all types of people though.\n \n \n \nHe isn't pious, he is pushing for the confirmation because of the school's threat to fail her.\n\n Hard to believe. I'd personally check this out. \n \n \nHe is also a jerk.\n\n Subjctive. Most ex's are regardless of facts. This could be true or merely what's percieved when one ex 'retaliates' against another.\n \n \nI don't think my sister in law would have minded the baptism so much - it was that he didn't even tell her - that she wasn't included that really ticks her off.\n\n Been there myself. However, she can do the same with him...could even be doing so.\n \n \nBut then - this guy is a first class dick. He refuses to co-paernt. Rarely calls - will only send messgaes through the daughter.\n\n If true, that's shameful and inappropriate. You're not to use the children for communications or to place them in the middle. Lots of F***** up stuff can happen. The child's given too much power for one. \n \n \nWhen my sister in law was married - it was on one of his nights. She called weeks in advance to ask for the day and told him that if she didn't hear otherwise she would assume it was OK. He calls (a rarity in itself) 5 minutes before we have to leave to demand we bring my neice to him for karate practice. On three separate occasions he has tried to get full custody (and failed and was scolded by the judge all three times). In court he would bring up things like my sister in law not returning my neice to him on time once because she was stuck up north (where she is from) in a blizzard. One other time it was because they had to go up north urgently because my sister in law's father had a stroke.\n\n What I'v heard and found to be an excellent practice is to keep a daily journal and to chronicle every little thing. Such are often admissable in court (even from such a form as LiveJournal) and a writen documentation is far better and easier to use than 'memory'.\n Also remember, if the mother has full custoddy (in regards to saying where she goes to school), she can simply put the girl in public education. Also, the father has set a precident for putting her in private (at cost) education. Such is a tool to be used in court to get him to continue payments even in a different school.\n \n \nAll parents get to indoctrinate - kind of hard to parent without instilling your values. I simply have issue with forcing a promise like this. Its a lie. And no worries - my neice knows I love her. I spoil her plenty. When I told her I was sleeping in and not going to come - she said that she didn't blame me and wished she could as well.\n\n I know. \n \n As I said, I'd recommend a counselor. There should be programs in your area that would offer them for free (or really cheap). Having the girl go 1-2 times a month initially would let her vent to someone not involved if she feel the need as well as let an outside party see if there is anything wrong.\n \n I personally LOATH it when children get tossed in the middle of bickering. But, it happens with nearly everyone even those who think they are following all the rules.\n Take Karate for instance.\n Is that really for the girls benefit (i'd say yes initially) or was it set up so that one parent can make the excuse that 'she needs to be at X place on time'...making the other parent go through an inconvienance.\n Unless agreed upon by both parents, there is no requirement that 'mother' comply with 'father's plans when it's 'her day' or visa versa. However, then psychological issues come up if the mother doesn't. The dad can bad mouth the mom more easily by drumming up how awsome Karate is and how much the daughter likes it and what a bad person it is for mom not take here.\n Damned if you do and damned if you don't.\n \n At 13ish, a child can often in court, state whom they wish to live with. If the judge is willing to listen, he can grant full custody based on these wishes IIRC and the other parent being granted child parenting time minimums or more if the parents agree on it.\n \n But, document everything would be my 1st piece of advice and don't tell anyone about it unless it's needed in courts.\n \n \n I'm a huge fan of 'father's' rights...actually 'EQUAL' rights in parenting, and this advice would be for all parties involved.\n If the parent is using the child as a 'go-between' ignore everything said.\n If they are unwilling to communicate directly (registered mail, phone calls, in person), inform them of using a lawyer for purposes of communication. \n Simply respond to the judge that professionals have stated that this is an improper form of communication and that you have a phone and mail box that the ex is fully aware of. You see no reason to blindly believe that what the child says (at this age) is accurate or 100% truthful. Placing so much power in the childs hands can lead to abuse where the kid plays both parents off against each other not because of maliciousness but because they don't want to be stuck in the middle and doing so comes natural. Get mom mad at dad, get dad mad at mom, at least they aren't mad at me. Because *insert* I really like doing what mom/dad does even though dad/mom get upset. I'd rather have them mad at the other than mad at me.\n \n I'd also advise reading everything on Parental Alienation Syndrom, Malicious 'Mother' and Madea complex. While not all applies, it can hopefully lead to a more healthy child and spot underhanded tactics when they show.\n From what I gather PAS will be a valid psychological condition for MDS-IV(sp?) by 2010.",
