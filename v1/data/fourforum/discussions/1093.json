   "1. Gun haters claim they do not want to take your guns. Gun haters claim they just want the guns the criminals use. Ok, so are the gun haters claiming the police department are giving the guns criminals use for crime back to the criminals? \n \n Last time I checked when a person commits a crime with a gun the gun is taken from the criminal. The only way the person would get the gun back is if the person was found not guilty. So once again if gun haters are not after the guns of the law abiding citizens what guns are the gun haters after? I mean if the police have all ready taken the guns away from the criminals.\n \n The only gun control law that is needed is the law that prohibits a person from committing a crime with a gun. A law that prohibits murder, robbery, assault, extortion, rape, and threatening people.\n This law would only affect the people that violated it. Unlike gun bans that only law abiding citizens obey!",

His work is so novel he was awared the Bancroft Prize. <------- All LIES\n \n http://www.bradycampaign.org/press/release.asp?Record=283\n \n The truth is he was fired from his university position and his prize taken back are proof positive his work is nothing but LIES.\n \n Note the date on the website.
