   "ok, maybe not really but it got you to look at this thread....\n \n Gay Rights Group Slams American Idol\n \n \nOn Tuesday's show, seen by a Nielsen-chart topping 35.5 million viewers, Cowell told one male contestant to \"wear a dress\" and Jackson asked another, \"are you a girl?\"\n \n \"The real offense here was in the producer's decision to add insult to injury by turning a contestant's gender expression into the butt of a joke,\" said Damon Ramine, a spokesman for GLAAD, in a statement posted on the group's Web site.\n",

   "i saw the show as well. in fact, from the reaction after this person got rejected, i knew this was coming. first of all, the contestant never said he was gay. but he did admit that lots of people think he's a girl. he wore an armless top, lady's jeans with a studded belt, and high-heeled boots. he wore his hair long, with blond streaks. maybe theres a pic of him on the web somewhere\n \n to think comments like \"are you a girl?\" or \"wear a dress\" would be so offensive just goes to show the double standard of the gay-card game. the guy opens the conversation by admitting that people often ask him if he's a girl, yet he's offended when randy asks the same. also, he comes to the audition dressed in full female clothes, yet he's offended because simon suggests he wear a dress. and in all likeliness the guy probably wears dresses on a reguar basis. so why feel offended?",

He no doubt helps the show's ratings. The suggestion to 'wear a dress' was actually directed to a black man with a beard, not the effeminate contestant involved in the brouhaha with GLAAD. \n \n Here's a picture of the man at the center of the storm as he appeared on the show. We had the TV tuned in, though I wasn't paying attention until I heard him say that people think he's a girl. I glanced up and thought for sure that he was, given the style of his hair cut and girly clothes.\n \n Anyway, with the judges having been baited by his girlish charm and attire, coupled with his remark that he's often asked if he's a girl, it seemed natural that Randy should ask, 'Are you?'\n \n The contestant's retort: 'No, I'm a guy. I go the bathroom standing up, just like you.'",
