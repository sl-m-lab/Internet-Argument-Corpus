   "ok, this was recently brought to my attention by my physical science teacher, hydrogen powered cars are not feasible for 2 reasons\n \n the first and biggest reason is this, hydrogen cannot be easily held in liquid state, so any fuel tank would have to contain the gas, pressurized gas, very explosive pressurized gas. any wrecks would be disatrous \n \n second, and this deals only with the internal combustion engines portion, hydrogen has this problem, when in the proper air/fuel mix it tends to explode, unlike gasoline which burns much slower. in a this explosion is called detonation, and it literally destroys your engine\n \n seems like we are barking up the wrong tree on this subject, perhaps we should invest more into other things, fusion power looks promising, super cheap electricity (fuelwise cheap) or perhaps soy diesel, would help agriculture alot\n \n Mathurin",

Hint: they are not planning to 'burn' hydrogen like they do gasoline to generate power for the engine. \n \n Also read up on \"Hindenburg\" to learn more about that \"hydrogen\" accident. Hint: the Hindenburg's skin 'coating' was flammable -- very, very, very flammable. It didn't take long for the whole airship to go down. The Hindenburg's sister airship, \"Graf Zeppelin\", went on to log more than a million miles. The material used to coat that ship's skin was changed after the Hindenburg accident. They still used hydrogen.\n \n And finally, in your readings, you might want to take note on the difference between hydrogen and gasoline and how they might react in an accident. Gasoline tanks have gasoline vapors. These vapors can ignite in an accident. That's why it wouldn't be a good idea to smoke at a gas station. Hydrogen, on the other hand, is a gas -- a very light gas, much lighter than gasoline vapors -- that disspates quickly, especially if they are under pressure.",
