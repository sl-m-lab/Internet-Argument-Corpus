You know how in every western every cowboy wears a six gun in a holster on his hip? In reality hip holsters were an extreme rarity in the old west except for cowboys who spent their days on horseback. Many wore a concealed weapon, true; but many more didn't carry a weapon at all. And gunfights as portrayed in movies just didn't happen that way on a regular basis at all. Even the men in the gun battle at the OK Corral between the Earp's and the Clanton's didn't have holsters on. These events were so rare, that's why the same events are retold by hollywood rather than receiving an endless supply of new gunfight stories which occurred. \n \n It was also a practice to check guns in many towns as they were illegal within the city limits. Chester will claim we are attempting to promote a hollywood version of the old west when the hollywood version of the old west is precisely what he is claiming was reality. Go figure huh!",
