   "The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is offering futures and options on futures based on proprietary house price indices. The indices are constructed and maintained by Fiserv CSW, and there are a few other organisations involved to bolster public confidence in accuracy. The futures expire quarterly in February, May, August, and November. The indices are 3-month averages based on 2-month look back. The indices are repeat sale in nature, similar to the OFHEO HPI. There are 10 individual city indices plus a weighted composite.\n \n Here's the brochure:\n \n http://www.cme.com/files/CmeCsiHousingIntroWhitePaper.pdf\n \n The futures pay $250 per index point. The Las Vegas index was 122 in December 2002, and is now 231. That's 89% growth in four years. If it pulls back 10%, a short position in one futures contract would yield a profit of about $5,800 before transaction and collateral costs. The Los Angeles index has grown 91% during the same period. A 20% pullback would generate a profit of about $13,600 per contract.\n \n Who's taking the long positions? Not many people. The open interest in these contracts is very thin. I doubt I'll be able to take a short position at all, much less at a reasonable price. I'll keep you posted.\n \n Jeff",
