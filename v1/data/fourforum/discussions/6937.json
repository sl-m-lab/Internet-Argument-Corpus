   "In reading one of many articles for Embryology class, I ran across the following material, quoted at the bottom. Here are the key take-home points.\n \n A single gene, WT1, encodes two slightly different protein products (actually, it encodes 24 different proteins products - or isoforms - but only 2 are of interest here). \n \n Now, what does the mere exclusion of 3 amino acids in one of the two isoforms do? Does it absolutely destroy the protein's ability to perform a useful biological function, as Creationists would have us believe? Nope! It merely CHANGES the function the protein product performs! Yep, it's even worse for Creationists than they could imagine! In this case, removal of just 3 contiguous amino acids creates a different protein that performs a different, biologically useful function!\n \n Gee, but I thought IDists and Creationists, including Behe, said that functional proteins are so isolated in sequence space that it's \"impossible\" to create a new functional protein from an existing one; well, without God's assistance. Nope.\n \n \n\"In mammals, [the] WT1 [gene] can give rise to 24 different protein isoforms through a combination of alternative splicing, alternative translation start sites, and RNA editing. All isoforms contain four C-terminal C2H2 zinc fingers and an N-terminal Pro/Glu-rich region. The +KTS and -KTS isoforms arise from an alternative splicing event that incorporates or omits, respectively, three amino acids - Lys, Thr, and Ser - between zinc fingers 3 and 4. Analysis of the function of the +KTS and -KTS isoforms has revealed that they have very different biochemical properties. WT1(-KTS) is a classic transcription factor - in addition to upregulating SRY expression it activates BCL2 (apoptosis inhibitor), CDKN1A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), and DAX1 (maleness inhibitor; also known as NR0B1). In contrast, the WT1(+KTS) isoform does not appear to be a transcription factor. It has been proposed that this isoform has a role in RNA processing because it colocalizes with splicing speckles in nuclei and bind to the splice factor U2AF65.\n \n Recently, Hammes et al. conducted an isoform-specific knockout, which disrupted the production of either the -KTS or +KTS isoforms of Wt1. Both male and female mice lacking the Wt1(-KTS) isoform have reduced gonad size, but cells in the gonads of male mice exhibit male-specific marker gene expression, albeit at a much reduced level. ...\n \n Mice lacking Wt1(+KTS) have severe kidney defects, and although female gonad development appeared normal, male null mice exhibited complete XY sex reversal.\"\n (Sex with two SOX on: SRY and SOX9 in testis development, Michael J. Clarkson and Vincent R. Harley, Trends in Endocrinology & Metabolism, Vol. 13, No. 3, 2002)\n \n\n \n \n PS: Saying that 3 amino acids are eliminated from the + isoform to arrive at the - isoform is a matter of perspective, in that one could just as well say that 3 amino acids were added to the - isoform to arrive at the + isoform. It's really irrelevant. The main point is that a single contiguous block of just 3 amino acids differs between the + and - isoforms, and yet the two virtually identical proteins perform two different, biologically useful functions.",

That's an increase in information.",
