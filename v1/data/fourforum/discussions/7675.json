   "All of your claims are at least arguable, but let's just stick with one.\n \n Socialism requires democracy, so the political theory textbooks say. \n \n 1). The commitment to representative democracy is what is supposed to distinguish soft-centred 'Western' socialism from the hard case 'communist' version brought about by revolutionary violence. \n \n 2). The 'parliamentary road to socialism' is said to be a creature so different from the socialism of the communist states as to be hardly the same political animal.\n \n Yes, I've encountered these sort of theoretical distinctions before. But facts force us to discard some theories - or else torture ourselves trying to reconcile the irreconciliable. Evidence is a fact (or facts) that discriminates between one theory and another, and things haven't worked out on the textbook model. \n \n The only socialist models that provide us with any empirical evidence of their attitude towards patriotism include the states I've already mentioned. And they did not become socialist by democratic acclamation. Though, of course, you deny that any of them are 'socialist' now - or perhaps ever have been? That allows your claim about patriotism to be impervious to contradiction by mere facts. \n \n A footnote on Cuba:\n \n According to Castro, Cuba has an elected national legislature that is socialist in character. Since only one party you can vote for exists in Cuba, it's not a democracy as we understand it. But if it wasn't for pressure from that wicked United States, the 'marginal socialism' there would blossom into ...........well, what?",

   "I gather by private enterprise directed by the state, you mean that private enterprise has been abolished and replaced with state enterprise, ie socialism.\n \n That the names and the language of business is used is of no relevance to the reality of fascism, which is the same as under all forms of socialism, private, free exchange is abolished. There may still be goods in stores, but the government determines their price. People may still be employed, but the government determines their wages and positions. Businessmen may still run businesses, but what they produce, how much they pay their workers, is determined by the government.\n\n \n absolutly not. Under a fascist regime, the directed cpaitalism primarily takes the form of strict regulation and rampant cronyism. Private enterprise is not abolished under a Fascist system, it is strengthened. In many fascist countires, private corporations have even been given defacto police powers. \n \n This is one of the fears peopel play in regarding special interest involvement in politics. The fascist state has also been called \"the corporate state\". While the corporativism described by mussolini is not quite in line with what we know as corporatism today, it is close enough to completely dispel this myth of a fascist/socialist state that you seem to be attempting to propogate.\n \n \nThis is not the socialist ideal, it is one of many. Other socialists idealise the means of production owned and actively managed by people of pure Germanic blood.\n \n In summary, socialism comes in many different shapes and colours, and it is no more valid for a socialist of one variety to assert that other varieties are \"not socialism\" than it is for a Protestant to assert that a Catholic is \"not Christian\".\n\n \n You REALLY need to run, don't walk, to your nearest institute of higher education and take some classes in political science.",

   "I understand socialism to be a sort of half-way house, or transitional stage, between Capitalism and Communism. \n \n The means of production and exchange are taken into social ownership (nationalised) and the state persists as an administrative machine that supervises a new order of legality and a new system of rights until such time as true common ownership emerges, and the state is abolished (or withers away). \n \n This nationalisation of some key industries and services is more or less what happened in Britain under the Labour government elected in 1945. But we never expected further political development in the direction of the theoretical dictatorship of the proletariat, and none ever materialised.\n\n \n I think that where a lot fo confusion comes from is in the difference between socialism, which is a narrowly defined economic system, and socialist ideals, which tends to be a subjective set of standards applied on an ad hoc basis.\n \n Classic socialism has never actually been practiced on the planet earth. From a practical standpoint, Sweden is probably a lot closer to the classic socialist model than the USSR was. Of all current \"socialist\" nations, it is probably Cuba that holds the distinction of being the absolute closest to a true socialist system.

That is why I state above that Sweden and Cuba ar probably the closest thign the world has ever seen to socialism. In Cuba, 80% of food is produced by worker managed collectives. From a practical standpoint, a true socialist economy essentially prohibits government ownership of anything. As Alan points out above, socialism was supposed to be a transitional step between capitalism and the anarcy of pure communism. To argue that in a socialist economy the means of production must be owned or directed by the government, or that a totalitarian government is required is just foolish.

For example, your contention that socialism is not an economic system, but instead is a lack of an economic system is just absolutly ignorant. Socialism is BY DEFINITION a type of economic system. Only one of the economic systems listed above actually has a political system attached, and that is communism, and in that case it is ANARCY.\n \n Fascism is not an economic system. It is a political system with certain conditions regarding how business entities are dealt with. In argentina, they executed a fascist government with an economy that was decidedly free market capitalist. \n \n Socialism has no political structure attached, though Marx did speak of a benign dictator at some point (though he is not entirely clear about exactly what stage in the process this benign dictator is expected to step in). The Soviet union was a LONG ways from the socialist ideal. Sweden is socialist. You can wriggle around on that all you want, but they are socialist and proud of it. They practice democratic socialism. Regardless of the political system in place, socialism is an ECONOMIC system.\n \n Capitalism is also an ECONOMIC SYSTEM.

   "Unregulated capitalism is quite horrifying - to the owners of large corporations. They are forever at the mercy of the whims of consumers and the advances of rivals, all of whom are attempting to undercut their prices, improve upon their products and take their customers at every turn. Business is cuthroat, and no company will likely stay at the top for long.\n \n The state offers them a means by which a large corporation can be permanently entrenched, they can be granted a monopoly and their losses insured.\n \n Wal-Mart for example, is a strong advocate of raising the minimum wage, not, of course, because they wish to pay their workers more (they could do this themselves of course, voluntarily, without their being a law), but because they wish to drive out of business smaller competitors who cannot afford the same monetary wages as Wal-Mart offers (even though they may offer better working conditions in other respects, eg a less hectic workplace, closer location to home etc).\n \n Intellectual support of socialism is similarly self-serving. In a free society the role of political scientists, economists, and politicians themselves is fairly unimportant, they may catalogue a history of economic events, teach that history to students, make forecasts. But in a socialist state their positions are of much greater importance and grandeur - the intellectuals take on the role of \"social planners\", they must decide what everyone else must do, what projects and technologies should be pursued, where resources should be allocated, etc.\n \n In a more immediate sense, the intellectual who takes on such a \"planning role\", even in a more limited sense, will easily find employment, by the government, than one who confronts ideologically the justification for taking any measures at all. For example, an intellectual who today writes a paper on \"How to win the war in Iraq: psychological warfare in the 21st century\" will easily find himself a highly paid member of the military industry, while one who suggests we withdraw from Iraq will not. Or more distantly, Keynes rose to prominence after the German government promoted him as \"Britain's greatest economist\", for declaring that the reason for Germany's economic hardship were the reparations it was orderered to pay. In this way, if ten individuals set out with honest intentions, some socialist leaning and some not, it is the socialist ones who will be promoted, by the government, as great thinkers.\n \n Of course, exposure to political and economic theory can swing a person either way. But this is the primary reason, in my view, that so many intellectuals and \"business leaders\", with little exposure to theory at all, support an increased role for government.",

It was first used, self-referentially, in the English language in 1827 to refer to followers of Robert Owen. In France, again self-referentially, it was used in 1832 to refer to followers of the doctrines of Saint-Simon and thereafter by Pierre Leroux and J. Regnaud in l'Encyclop&#233;die nouvelle. Use of the word spread widely and has been used differently in different times and places, both by various individuals and groups that consider themselves socialist and by their opponents. While there is wide variation between socialist groups...\n \n By the time of the Revolution of 1848 there were a variety of competing \"socialisms\", the most influential being those founded by Saint-Simon, Owen and Charles Fourier. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels by this time were referring to themselves as \"communists\", in large part to distinguish themselves from the above ideologies, which they described as \"utopian socialism\". (Engels later used the term \"scientific socialism\" to describe Marxism.)...\n \n Depending on the context, the term socialism may refer either to these ideologies or any of their many lineal descendants. \n \n Thankyou for demonstrating why there are so many internal conflicts between socialists, each declares their brand of socialism is the only true socialism and that all the others are not real socialists at all, but capitalist sympathisers. \n \n \nall governments tend to collapse\n\n \n Because all governments, once established, tend towards socialism.",

It seems like what many are advocating is essentially picking the working portions of both theories and putting them into practice under a single new system, one which meets the definition of neither socialism or capitalism.\n \n From a practical standpoint, the capitalist system is one of the oldest continually operated systems on the planet, and has inevitably failed everywhere it has ever been tried.

The going theory seems to be that you could essentially lift certain components of socialism, implant them in a capitalist system, and have an economy that is not destined to fail.\n \n I think there is some merit to this, EXCEPT that it will invariably fail under a democratic form of government because the population will eventually always abuse the socialist aspects of the system. The question essentially becomes how much socialism is enough, and how much is too much.\n \n From a practical standpoint, wothwhile integration of socialist conspets into a capitalist economy or society is likely to continually fail, at least in this generation, because as symbiote has been good enough to show us, there are many who do not grasp even the most basic understanding of either economic system, preferring instead to simply label one as inherently evil and the other as inherently good. \n \n In reality, they are both likely to be utter failures.

Keep working for next to nothing while the government continues to siphon more money out of my hard earned paycheck, eh?",

And you were recently very upset because New York State refused to pony up a couple of hundred thousand dollars of tax money for each $20k job a foreign corporation would provide in your geographical area. You can't have it both ways.",

   "I did not define socialism as evil. Nor was I asked to explain a free society. I was asked a yes or no question, whether the government not keeping tabs on its citizens was the definition of a free society, a question which I answered for you more than adequately. If you have any followup questions, feel free to ask them.\n \n\n That is good enough for me. Just me misunderstanding.",

   "In class I have to debate why if we were to start a new country why it should be socialistic. I don't want this to turn into a debate, I only wants links and reasons on why we should go socialistic over capitalistic.\n \n Thanks for helping.\n \n *REMINDER* please do not turn this into a debate!\n\n \n Socialism is a very broad category of political ideals, which particular form were you thinking of?\n \n And just so you know, Fascism is not a form of socialism in any way. Socialism does not have oppressive governments. The purpose of socialism is to remove the class differences in society, if there is a small group of bureaucrats enforcing their will on the workers then that's a class difference.",

   "One of the biggest problems with socialism is the cradle-to-grave government provision. This quashes the entrepeneurial spirit and the drive to improve one's lot in life.\nIs there really an entrepreneurial spirit? Is there a drive to improve one's lot in life? Maybe there is a survival instinct. Sure some of us are born with a salesman gene, but that doesn't mean there is an entrepreneurial spirit that drives us all. These salesman people will claw their way to top of any economic/political system, so it best to try for a system that guarantees that everyone will have access to life-essential resources.",

   "If you live in a place where there is a governing body, you're living under some measure of socialism. A Government can only handle socialized things. Meaning If the Government touches it, it's a social event.\n \n The United States is heavily socialized. \n \n Bill Gates doesn't have the Navy wash his yacht and General Motors doesn't use the Army to transport their trucks. Warren Buffet can't kick you out of Yellow Stone and Larry Ellison can't stop you from Using US 1 to see the coast.\n \n Nothing is more socialized than a standing army. This is why initially; the United States tried to work with Militias less an actual Active Military. Our military institutions are the peoples. We have the Peoples Navy, Army and Air force; we don't need Lords offering their Militias for a war as did Britain and so on, in the past under capitalism.\n \n First let's get rid of the concept that Socialism weakens a nation. This is a lie. Socialism makes a country very powerful. Germany was nothing before Hitler socialized its military industrial complex. After Socializing Germany became the most powerful nation on the earth and it took three massive countries to take her down. Britain; The United States; and Russia threw a ton of bodies into the battle to knock little Germany down.\n \n Before Russia socialized, it was nothing. Poland's last worry was over Russia. After socializing Russia became a superpower and the rest is history. We defeated Russia clearly. But how? Funny thing, if you where to count the number of socialists allied with Russia and the United States you would have found that the U.S. had a greater number. The United States had more capital moving into the Social defense area and Russia could not keep up, especially when its people where not clearly allied to their government. Nixon was the man that threw the wrench into the Russian imperial growth machine. Nixon opened relations with China. If Nixon would not have done this, we would have been where Russia is today. Our economy would have burst if we had to face a Russia united with China.\n \n A Country's money is only worth what it will buy. Cuba can become what ever it wants and it still falls back to, what can you buy with the money they print? Anything they build will require some form of import. Japan faced this pre-WWII and when we cut the supply of steel, they're economy was crushed.\n \n Interesting thing to consider; what can you buy with the Dollar? China takes the dollar for what? China wants to own a mountain of Fords? The Middle East only takes the dollar. What would happen if they didn't? Think long and hard about that.",
