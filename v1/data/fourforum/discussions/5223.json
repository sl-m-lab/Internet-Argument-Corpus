   "Speciation is whatever you say it is.\nNo. There are several definitions, depending on the context. Wildlife biologists and paleontologists use different definitions. Probably the most common modern definition used by biologists is the Biological Species Concept (BSC) defined by Ernst Mayr in 1942.\n \nDarwin said the Galapogos Finches were seperate species because they could not interbreed.\nNope. Darwin said no such thing. Darwin thought that the birds he collected were all a single species. It was actually Owen, a respected scientist who was still clinging to the biblical creation story, who pointed out that there were several species. Since Darwin didn't think it would matter, he didn't specify when and where he had collected his specimens. Thus, he convinced Capt. Fitzroy (also a believer in biblical creation), who had done a better job of tagging his specimens, to give his collection of finches to Owen for study. Owen classified the birds into several species, not Darwin. Further, the reasons for dividing the specimens into several species had nothing to do with ability to interbreed since the birds were all dead. The initial classification was based on morphology.\n \nThey can , Darwin was wrong.\nAs I pointed out, Darwin never made the claim so he wasn't wrong. Besides, just the statement that interbreeding makes two organisms the same species is ignorant. There are lots of species that can interbreed with closely related species. For example, lions and tigers are both members of the same genus and they can interbreed. However, they do so only in captivity since the wild populations are reproductively isolated. The same is true of polar bears and brown bears. In the case of Darwin's finches, they are usually reproductively isolated. However, on rare occasions some of the closely related species have been observed to interbreed. But a blanket statement that Darwin's finches can interbreed is either ignorant or dishonest. Generally, they cannot. Experiments that encouraged interbreeding among various species failed. The would not interbreed. On those rare occasions when it was observed, the two species observed were in the same genus. A Geospiza scandens was observed to interbreed with a G. fortis. I have only heard of interbreeding between two other species.\n \nI know evolutionist claim that if animals that could formerly interbreed can no longer do so it proves the common ancestor fairy tale. All it proves is they can no longer interbreed. It is absurd .\nSo you are claiming that a single species that splits into populations that can no longer breed did not have a common ancestor species. Do you ever actually think about what you are saying? Mostly your posts are incoherent.\n \nThere is no such thing as macro-evolution or pe for speciation to be a part of.\n It is a myth, a fairy tale , a stupid joke.\nSpeciation is by definition macro-evolution.

Does your guess make sense, does it fit the data? Yes? Then we'll run with it until someone comes up with a better hypothesis. No? Then throw it out and try again. We can't wait for the answers to be handed to us; the only option we have is to make our best guess and see how well it works.\n \n Second link: Some stars are close, therefore there was no big bang\n \n \"singularity of belief that compels astronomers to turn a blind eye to the wrong end of their telescopes while ignoring disagreements with what they imagine they see\"\n That mangling of the English language should, in and of itself, disqualify the article as a source of intelligent opinion.

That's evolution. Change. Are you suggesting some mythological god had a role, or are you you a little more advanced and understand how human reproduction works on a basic level?\n \n Bacteria, a better example, can actually swap genetic material, and \"evolve\" rapidly, without even needing to go through a sexual reproductive cycle.\n \n Just do a simple web search and I'm sure you'll learn some science..i.e. facts about reality.\n \n http://uanews.opi.arizona.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/UANews.woa/wa/SRStoryDetails?ArticleID=3669\n \nBacteria can easily swap genes by direct transfer of genetic material from one cell to another, even between bacteria that are only distantly related. This well-known phenomenon allows harmful bacteria to react quickly to new host defenses, and to share their new counter-defenses with each other - witness for example the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance among bacteria.\n\n \n Of course, we don't even need to get that complex, try the flu:\n \n \n\n 1. Influenza viruses evolve rapidly. \n \n Flu viruses mutate and evolve rapidly. (In fact, it has been estimated that the proteins of the influenza virus evolve as much as a million times faster than most human proteins!) For this reason, so new and slightly different viral strains appear all the time. The differences among these new strains often include changes in coat proteins. Therefore, any immune system memory cells produced by a vaccination or previous infection no longer recognize the new strains. When that happens, the immune response must mount a defense from scratch, and the viruses have enough time to make the host sick.\n \n If you think about this, you can probably see how our immune response creates a form of natural selection that drives the evolution of these viruses. Here's why. Strains that don't change their coat protein are stopped by the immune response before they can spread. These strains, therefore, have substantially lowered fitness, and are effectively wiped out. Strains that change their coat proteins, on the other hand, have higher fitness. These strains delay the immune response long enough to make us sick - which forces us to spread the virus to new hosts by coughing and sneezing\n. \n \n Or perhaps our own immune system response to bacteria and viruses?\n \n Are you sure you know what \"evolution\" means, because if you are suggesting viruses change by acts of god, and not through simple laws of physics, then I think you're missing something when you read/listen/process information. How much energy have you devoted to understanding the physics behind biological life? If you do devote a little time to it, you'll find a whole lot of great information and resources out there.\n \n -Mach",

Evolution is concerned with the change in allele frequency over time.\n \n \"Long ago\" is required and is provided by an old Earth. No knowledgable and honest person questions that the Earth is old. \"far far away\" isn't required though.\n\n Lots of knowledgable people question how old. Majority opinnion is not science. The majority is very often wrong.\n The age is everything . Evolution has to happen so slowly it cannot be seen.\n If the earth was only a million years old it could not have happened. The age of the earth is decided by committee and doubles approx. every 25 years. Anyone who raises doubts is denied funding . It is the most important element in the fairy tale.\n Changes that constitute basic changes like wings on lizards or the avian lung have never been observed only variations whitin a species . It is pure imagination to believe it happened. It is a fairy tale. It is not science.\n \n Long ago and far far away is the evolution senario. We know it happened and you can't see it happening so there!",

   "Lots of knowledgable people question how old.\nQuite right too. We should all question things all of the time. It helps to be able to ask intelligent questions though and to understand the answer.\n \n \nThe age is everything .\nThe age of the Earth is a significant piece of evidence in support of evolution. The age of the Universe is irrelevent.\n \n \nEvolution has to happen so slowly it cannot be seen.\nOf course it can. We have observed evolution happening many times.\n \n \nIf the earth was only a million years old it could not have happened.\nIf you were only three days old, you wouldn't be able to read and write. You can, so you are more than three days old. Life evolved, so the Earth is more than \"only a million years old\". These are self evident facts.\n \n \nThe age of the earth is decided by committee and doubles approx. every 25 years.\nIncorrect. The estimated age of the Earth approximately doubled every 20 years between 1850ish and 1980. It hasn't changed since 1980 and is extremely unlikely to change significantly ever again.",

It is also worth pointing out that 500 million to a billion years would be ample time for life to have evolved from nothing to what we see today. So this non existant committee could have simply fixed the age in 1907 and declared their job done. But as you say, it is not determined by committee, but instead is determined by experiment. As such it was bound to climb in arbitary jumps until the correct date was reached.",
