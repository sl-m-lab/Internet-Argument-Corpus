   "Rather frequently creationist will come here and say something along the lines of \"If evolution is true, than how did life start?\" And people here generally lay into them for linking the two. However, they aren't entirely to blame for making the connection. Check out this article from CNN:\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/08/15/harvard.evolution.ap/index.html\n \n Some Harvard researchers are getting a million dollars a year to study the question of how life started. Note that the article claims that this is a question about evolution, and no where uses the term abiogenesis. My local paper also ran a story about this, and also claimed that it was a question about evolution. I'd be curious to know if anyone can find an article about this that actually makes the distinction between evolution and abiogenesis.",

   "Yes, but the point is that even if we don't know exactly how life arose, that doesn't cast doubt on evolutionary theory. The theories of evolution apply to populations of living organisms. However, that does not mean that evolutionary principles, learned from evolutionary biology, can't be applied in other fields, for example, self-replicating organic molecules.",
