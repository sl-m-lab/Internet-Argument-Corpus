This article updates results announced in an ICR Impact article last year2 and documented at a technical conference last summer.3 Our experiments measured how rapidly nuclear-decay-generated Helium escapes from tiny radio-active crystals in granite-like rock. The new data extend into a critical range of temperatures, and they resoundingly confirm a num-erical prediction we published several years before the experiments.4 The Helium loss rate is so high that almost all of it would have escaped during the alleged 1.5 billion year uniformitarian5 age of the rock, and there would be very little Helium in the crystals today. But the crystals in granitic rock presently contain a very large amount of Helium, and the new experiments support an age of only 6000 years. Thus these data are powerful evidence against the long ages of uniformitarianism and for a recent creation consistent with Scripture. \n",

   "The RATE folk are making a big fuss over surprisingly high helium-4 contents in ancient zircons in ancient igneous rocks that are sitting over or next to major Late Cenozoic intrusions, and which are still quite hot at depth. The uranium - lead concentrations in the zircon crystals indicates that the crystals crystallized 1.5 billion years ago. Each decay produces a set amount of helium-4 (alpha particles, consisting of two protons and two neutrons). The zircons are pretty leaky with respect to helium, but some of these crystals still contain way too much helium (in one case up to 58% of the helium that that particular crystal should ever have produced from 1.5 billion years of radioactive decay). Given known leakage rates, all or nearly all of this helium should have been lost if the 1.5 billion year age is correct. I'll add that these zircons have every reason to be leaky (primarily they could easily have been heated up a bit in the recent past, as they sit near or over relatively recent intrusions, which would have made them even leakier for a while). Thus, if anything, the measured leakage rate is a low-end estimate, and much more helium could easily have been lost, making the retentions apparently even more surprising. Baumgartner et al. calculate that the leakage rate is so high that the present high concentrations could only be retained if the crystals were about 6000 years old. \n \n There have been many problems with what the RATE people have done over the years (because they have been exceptionally clueless about techniques, rock identification, basic asssumptions, geology in general, and so on), but they seem to be on route to fixing most of them (it was nice to see reference to analyses of the micas around the zircons, which partially clear up one earlier possible problem, for example). However, there are still two huge general problems with this work, plus a gigantic specific problem that they do not appear to be addressing. \n \n The first general problem is that they are using an experimental procedure (helium retention dating) that is fraught with problems (and which is intended to give not rock ages but cooling histories!) to call into question the conclusions from sound and tried and tested techniques of other dating methods have been well worked out (specifically U 235 to Pb 207, U 238 to Pb 206, Lead-Lead techniques, Th 232 to Pb 208). \n \n Zircons are almost ideal crystals for dating. They crystallize at high temperatures, they are very strong and refractory, they resist most common all forms of surficial weathering and dissolution, and they can contain quite a bit of uranium and thorium. The uranium atoms (and the lead atoms, whenever a uranium atom decays into one) are locked inside the zircon crystal lattice, like basketballs in a steel-bar cage. The cages are roomy, but the bonds between the regular atoms are narrow and tight, so zircon tends to hang on to its uranium, thorium, and lead crystals quite well. However, the cage is not entirely escape-proof. If you heat the crystal enough (to 800 or 900 degrees Centigrade), the \"bars\" expand, and the Pb \"basketballs\" can start to escape. The lead atoms aren't a good fit for the crystal, so if you heat it even more, it will start to recrystallize and in the process it will kick out some to all of the lead atoms that have accumulated in it. Below that temperature, the bars are cool and unexpanded, and the U & Pb atoms are almost entirely locked in tight.\n \n There are two exceptions, however. First, if the crystals are crushed, then daughter atoms are likely to escape. Both thorium and uranium decay through a series of intermediate stages, and in some stages the atom becomes radon. Radon is a noble gas, and does not want to combine with anything, so if fractures exist in the crystal, radon close to the fracture may leak out. (So we don't try to date crushed or cracked zircons.) \n \n Secondly, when uranium and thorium decay, some of the particles emitted are high pressure alpha particles (helium-4 ions). These blast a short way through the crystal for a least a short distance, leaving a short smashed tunnel. These are called fission tracks. They can be seen under a high powered microscope, and if you count the tracks and assess current radioactivity levels (i.e., the % of U & thorium atoms), you can get an quick and dirty assessment of time since crystallization. \n \n Helium retention dating is related to this, as the helium should just build up in the crystal as decays happen. However, first, decays very near the surface of the zircon may smash their way completely out of the crystal, so that helium may just be lost. This is a particular problem in very small zircons. Secondly, the damage tracks may provide pathways for other helium atoms to leak out and escape. This is a particular problem for crystals that are exceptionally rich in radioactive atoms and which get cloudy from radiation damage. Also, the crystal may heal itself: bonds are strained when fission tracks are made, and the atoms can get pulled back into their proper positions. This annealing happens more easily at higher temperatures, but gets common at around 300 degrees centigrade (or a bit lower under if conditions are favorable).\n \n The biggest difficulty for helium retention dating is that the helium atom is so very small that the \"steel bar cage\" that holds in the uranium, thorium, lead, and even the radon atoms can be completely useless in holding in the helium ions. Thus the closure temperature for undamaged zircon crystals with respect to helium-4 is quite cool, only 180-200 degrees centigrade or so. Moreover, with increasing radiation damage, the zircons become even more leaky with respect to helium.\n \n So in short, helium retention dating is messy and problematic at the best of times, whereas U-Pb methods work almost infinitely better on the same crystals. It is true that the leakiness problem would seem to favor Baumgartner et al. - I'm saying that the crystals are likely to have been even leakier than Baumgartner proposes, which should make them even younger - but we'll cover that in a minute. For now, it suffices that Baumgartner et al. are pitting a highly problematic method against a good method, which is generally a bad idea.\n \n The second general problem is that the very same crystals that supposedly give 6000 year old dates by helium retention dates give excellent dates of 1.5 billion years or so by much better U & Th - Pb methods. Their response is to suggest that the earth experienced a period of fast radiometric decay early on, basically making that 1.5 billion years of decay happen during Noah's flood. The problem is that this is a huge amount of decay worldwide, which should have released a huge amount of radioactivity and heat, which pretty much should have boiled off the oceans, parboiled Noah and his animals, and then slagged and calcined their corpses. Others have addressed this in detail - see links mentioned in earlier posts. (Dispensing with the heat is also a problem for cramming all the earth's ancient volcanic activity into the Noachian Flood year.) \n \n \n The more specific problem is related to the leakiness of the zircons and resolves the problem of high concentrations of Helium. Specifically, just as helium-4 ions can leak OUT of a crystal of zircon, so too they can leak IN. \n \n The hot zircons deep down in the cores are still above their helium closure temperatures, so they have little or no helium. The ones near the surface are cooler, and supposedly are below their closure temperatures, but nonetheless have far more helium than one would expect. The geology of this area is that the Jemez Mountain Volcanic Field has been active for about 14 million years, with the Valles caldera and Bandolier tuff forming two million years ago. There have been numerous intrusions of igneous rock, some of it quite radioactive, and related hydrothermally heated fluids have been circulating all through these rocks (hydrothermal fluids can easily move uranium and radon around). Just as excess argon can enter feldspars under the right circumstances, so too excess helium should be expected to soak into in zircons above and beside volcanic complexes.",

   "A little while ago I listened to a talk by Pat Bickford, who showed images of zircon crystals that had been extensively dated by SHRIMP instrumentation, which allows you to date minuscule spots within a tiny crystal. One particular crystal came from an area of complex and old geology in Minnesota, and it had had a correspondingly long and complex history. Its core formed at 2719 m.y. ago, and was added to by additional crystal growth around 2500 m.y. ago. Then there was a period when the zircon experienced some dissolution. \n \n (I think that was in situ dissolution, but sometimes zircons get eroded out of the rocks that they formed in, get transported around and become rounded and even broken, and then later get buried into a new deposit that in turn turns to rock, eventually gets metamorphosed, and the zircon experiences another phase of growth, millions or even hundreds of millions or billions of years after the first growth episode. I don't think Pat's zircons had experienced quite that complex a history.)\n \n Nonetheless, this particular zircon went on to experience two additional periods of growth, which were very distinct just when looking at a back-scattered electron image of the crystal (almost like looking at tree rings, except there were just four growth episodes, and of course they weren't annual!). SHRIMP dating showed that the different growth zones had clearly different dates, with the most recent phase ending at 1780 m.y. ago, when the island-continent represented by his rocks got caught up between between two slightly larger cratons, resulting in a serious epsiode of metamorphism, including major zircon growth. This collision and metamorphism fused the three bits of continent into the Wyoming to Ontario part of North America. That has been stable and cold ever since, so that was the end of the story for the zircon. So far, anyway (ominous drum roll, portending future cycles of rifting and re-collision). \n \n This is the sort of history that zircons can show you when you approach the geology honestly and competently. Such a history is in no way compatible with the whole silly Noah's Flood fantasy.\n \n (Go to the last link on http://earthsciences.syr.edu/Bickford/Pat.htm to see some zircons that show different but comparably complex histories.)\n \n Interestingly, these sorts of \"complex history\" zircons resolve a problem that creationists used to try to make hay from. Specifically, we used to just date entire zircons. When the entire zircon formed in one episode (such as in an unmetamorphosed granite), that worked perfectly well, but when the zircon had had a complex history (of the sort that can be common in very ancient gneisses and migmatites), the presence of different age zones means that the zircon would give mixed results, between the age of formation and the age of metamorphism. These inaccurate ages allowed creationists to charge that the results were inaccurate, so not even zircon dates could be trusted. Those issues have long been resolvable by other dating of the age of crystallization and the age of recrystallization, but the arguments probably sounded like special pleading. Now the multi-age histories are obvious, easily resolved, and easily avoided.",
