He then added blood stains, scorches and water stains to replicate the original.[147] But according to Giulio Fanti, professor of mechanical and thermic measurements at the University of Padua, \"the technique itself seems unable to produce an image having the most critical Turin Shroud image characteristics\".[148]\"",

   "Of course, even though someone reproduced the shroud using the techniques that people used in mediveal times, the shroud believers will say that's not enough \n \n Scientist re-creates Turin Shroud to show it's fake - CNN\n\n \n Yeah, I've seen this and several other articles. There is honestly tons of evidence that the shroud is from around 1300-1400, and no evidence that it is any older.\n \n \n\"Other evidence of medieval fakery includes the shroud's lack of historical record prior to the mid-fourteenth century?when a bishop reported the artist's confession?as well as serious anatomical problems, the lack of wraparound distortions, the resemblance of the figure to medieval depictions of Jesus, and suspiciously bright red and picturelike \"blood\" stains which failed a battery of sophisticated tests by forensic serologists, among many other indicators. These facts argue against Rogers' assertions that the shroud is neither a forgery nor a miracle?that \"the blood is real blood\"3 and the image was produced by \"a rotting body\" (Rogers 2004).\"\n\n \n CSI | Claims of Invalid &ldquo;Shroud&rdquo; Radiocarbon Date Cut from Whole Cloth\n \n Even when it was first \"discovered\" in the 14th century, it was reported numerous times that it was a forgery and that the artist himself admitted it. That's why not even the pope accepted it as authentic. \n \n None of this is even bringing up the biblical arguments against it, where in John they mention a 'napkin' wrapped around the head, which isn't seen in the shroud of Turin. They also mention 'strips' in John which would imply more than just a single sheet. From wiki:\n \n \nIn 1543 John Calvin, in his Treatise on Relics, wrote of the shroud, which was then at Nice (it was moved to Turin in 1578), \"How is it possible that those sacred historians, who carefully related all the miracles that took place at Christ's death, should have omitted to mention one so remarkable as the likeness of the body of our Lord remaining on its wrapping sheet?\" He also noted that, according to St. John, there was one sheet covering Jesus's body, and a separate cloth covering his head. He then stated that \"either St. John is a liar,\" or else anyone who promotes such a shroud is \"convicted of falsehood and deceit\"\n\n \n There were also 'fake shrouds' before it... as for the wikipedia rebuttal of the guy who tried to make a duplicate shroud, the whole pdf file is found here:\n \n http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/HeimburgerWeb.pdf\n \n The article admits that the duplicate is pretty close, has the fuzzy image, has the 'pseudo-negative' image, has some 3D data, but basically concludes that the Turin shroud's 3D image is better, and that it was probably different paints (or whatever it is) or a better artist (no s**t). Obviously nobody is going to get it perfect, and the original artist (some think it was Da Vinci) was probably better than anybody who is going to attempt to recreate it. All of the biggest features of the shroud were reproduced, but since the thing is 600+ years old (worn, faded, and burnt) and heavily protected (not open to a lot of testing), we'll probably never know exactly what exact pigments or techniques were used.\n \n My point wasn't really to bring up a debate on it (although what better place than a debate forum), I was just interested in knowing how EZ and some of the others felt about it. I was just honestly surprised that the other guy I was talking to \"knew\" that it was real. Of course I brought up a lot of these points, but it didn't do any good (it never does).",
