   "here is something for all you dumb atheists\n \n One day a 6 year old girl was sitting in a classroom. The teacher was going to explain evolution to the children. \n The teacher asked a little boy: Tommy do you see the tree outside? \n TOMMY: Yes. \n TEACHER: Tommy, do you see the grass outside? \n TOMMY: Yes. \n TEACHER: Go outside and look up and see if you can see the sky. \n TOMMY: Okay. (He returned a few minutes later) Yes, I saw the sky. \n TEACHER: Did you see God? \n TOMMY: No. \n TEACHER: That is my point. \n We can not see God because he is not there. \n He does not exist. \n A little girl spoke up and wanted to ask the boy some questions. \n The teacher agreed and the little girl asked the boy: Tommy, \n do you see the tree outside? \n TOMMY: Yes. \n LITTLE GIRL: Tommy do you see the grass outside? \n TOMMY: Yessssss (getting tired of the questions by this time). \n LITTLE GIRL: Did you see the sky? \n TOMMY: Yessssss \n LITTLE GIRL: Tommy, do you see the teacher? \n TOMMY: Yes \n LITTLE GIRL: Do you see her brain? \n TOMMY: No \n LITTLE GIRL: Then according to what we were taught today in school, \n she must not have one!",

   "While I'm at it I'd like to anaylze the material presented:\n \n First off this is a classical theist / Chrisitan story for the purpose of advocating the idea of God. This can be used from Sunday school to email forwards.\n \n The average one hearing this gathers the point that just because its not seen doesn't mean its not there and moves on without much further thought.\n \n Notice how the story uses a teacher. The teacher is often considered to be intelligent and knowing. Also the teacher is given much respect by kids who this is a classical story for. So when the teacher is defied by the \"little girl\" without a futher response from the teacher the readers assume that the point is true and that the teacher has no response.\n \n The boy is referred to as \"tommy\" while (whoever) is referred to as \"little girl\".\n The picture of a little girl adds innocence to the idea implying that her point is simple without requiring much thought. \n \n The story leaves off with the \"little girl\" establishing a weak theist point without giving the teacher / atheist a chance to respond.\n \n As for the theist point:\n \n \"Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean its not there\"\n \n As I have said its a bad comparison. The beleif in that I you or I have a brain can be reached by using logic and evidence. There is much more logic and evidence to support the existance of a brain than there is to support the evidence of God.",

If that god tells us the earth is young, and the earth is apparently old (based on physical evidence) then either a) the earth is actually old and that god didn't have a hand in it/doesn't exist/doesn't matter or b) that god made it young, and planted evidence that made it look old. either way it's a lie, and so the definition of god where god is all powerful, never lies, and inspired the bible to be the truth probably does not exist. \n \n (I'm not looking for a debate about how apparent physical evidence contradicts apparent messages in the bible.

   "You shouldnt call somebody dumb because of their beliefs and besides atheists dont define themselves as atheists yes its something OTHER PEOPLE call them to recognize what and who they are. Yes granted some of them go to a ATHEIST CHURCH but you go a catholic or whatever church or maybe you dont go to church but \n the point is you are as good as they are maybe less since you didnt pay attention to that big fact so obvisously you didnt do your research. A couple more things about the whole \"dumb atheists\" part really are they all dumb do you know every single atheists are they really all dumb calling them dumb and stupid is like judging a person by their race or heritage. I'm sorry but i had to post this because well 1.you were being a hypocrite 2.it was very rude of you call atheism and atheists dumb 3.every time i thought about your message today it me angier and angier\n well signing off this is Anna",

It's a ridiculous story otherwise as well...\n \n 1. How many secular teachers talk about God in class? I've never had a teacher in any of the secular schools I went to say anything about God, for fear of the controversy it would create. Teachers live in fear of controversy, they don't want to get fired. I think this idea that non-Christian teachers try to convince students that God doesn't exist is a fundamentalist paranoid fantasy.\n \n 2. How many atheists use the \"you can't see it so it doesn't exist\" argument? very few. They will use the \"there is no evidence so I don't believe you\" argument, but that has nothing to do with whether Timmy can see teacher's brain.",

   "As a card carrying atheist, I am often bemused by the lines we all draw over our disagreements. Any issue short of the existence of god is nothing but a distraction to me.\n \n The issue is quite simply do you have faith or not. If you don't you will never understand those that do and if you do you will never understand those that don't. The real issue then becomes how does it matter.\n \n I typically only enter an argument when I feel that my individual right to this conclusion is being subjugated to the will of others. I do not resent the proclamation, ecumenism or downright missionary zeal of the faithful. I do resent the unwillingness for other views to be proferred.\n \n All I know is that until science has answered all the questions, there will be a substantial reason for people to carry faith. I only fear the reality of jihad's and crusades. If these behaviour ever become the norm in modern society, I will have to have to take a more activist position.",
