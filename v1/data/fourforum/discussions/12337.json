   "At any moment, state inspectors can step uninvited into one of the three child care centers that Ethel White runs in Auburn, Ala., to make sure they meet state requirements intended to ensure that the children are safe. There must be continuing training for the staff. Her nurseries must have two sinks, one exclusively for food preparation. All cabinets must have safety locks. Medications for the children must be kept under lock and key, and refrigerated.\n \n The Rev. Ray Fuson of the Harvest Temple Church of God in Montgomery, Ala., does not have to worry about unannounced state inspections at the day care center his church runs. Alabama exempts church day care programs from state licensing requirements, which were tightened after almost a dozen children died in licensed and unlicensed day care centers in the state in two years.\n \n The differences do not end there. As an employer, Ms. White must comply with the civil rights laws; if employees feel mistreated, they can take the center to court. Religious organizations, including Pastor Fuson's, are protected by the courts from almost all lawsuits filed by their ministers or other religious staff members, no matter how unfairly those employees think they have been treated.\n \n And if you are curious about how Ms. White's nonprofit center uses its public grants and donations, read the financial statements she is required to file each year with the Internal Revenue Service. There are no I.R.S. reports from Harvest Temple. Federal law does not require churches to file them.\n \n Far more than an hourlong stretch of highway separates these two busy, cheerful day care centers. Ms. White's center operates in the world occupied by most American organizations. As a religious ministry, Pastor Fuson's center does not.\n \n In recent years, many politicians and commentators have cited what they consider a nationwide \"war on religion\" that exposes religious organizations to hostility and discrimination. But such organizations - from mainline Presbyterian and Methodist churches to mosques to synagogues to Hindu temples - enjoy an abundance of exemptions from regulations and taxes. And the number is multiplying rapidly.\n \n Some of the exceptions have existed for much of the nation's history, originally devised for Christian churches but expanded to other faiths as the nation has become more religiously diverse. But many have been granted in just the last 15 years - sometimes added to legislation, anonymously and with little attention, much as are the widely criticized \"earmarks\" benefiting other special interests.\n \n An analysis by The New York Times of laws passed since 1989 shows that more than 200 special arrangements, protections or exemptions for religious groups or their adherents were tucked into Congressional legislation, covering topics ranging from pensions to immigration to land use. New breaks have also been provided by a host of pivotal court decisions at the state and federal level, and by numerous rule changes in almost every department and agency of the executive branch.\n \n The special breaks amount to \"a sort of religious affirmative action program,\" said John Witte Jr., director of the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at the Emory University law school.\n \n Professor Witte added: \"Separation of church and state was certainly part of American law when many of today's public opinion makers were in school. But separation of church and state is no longer the law of the land.\"\n \n The changes reflect, in part, the growing political influence of religious groups and the growing presence of conservatives in the courts and regulatory agencies. But these tax and regulatory breaks have been endorsed by politicians of both major political parties, by judges around the country, and at all levels of government.\n \n \"The religious community has a lot of pull, and senators are very deferential to this kind of legislation,\" said Richard R. Hammar, the editor of Church Law & Tax Report and an accountant with law and divinity degrees from Harvard.\n \n As a result of these special breaks, religious organizations of all faiths stand in a position that American businesses - and the thousands of nonprofit groups without that \"religious\" label - can only envy. And the new breaks come at a time when many religious organizations are expanding into activities - from day care centers to funeral homes, from ice cream parlors to fitness clubs, from bookstores to broadcasters - that compete with these same businesses and nonprofit organizations.\n \n Religious organizations are exempt from many federal, state and local laws and regulations covering social services, including addiction treatment centers and child care, like those in Alabama.\n \n Federal law gives religious congregations unique tools to challenge government restrictions on the way they use their land. Consequently, land-use restrictions that are a result of longstanding public demands for open space or historic preservation may be trumped by a religious ministry's construction plans, as in a current dispute in Boulder County, Colo. http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/business/08religious.html?_r=1\n \n The article goes on and on with a variety of examples.\n \n Religion is catered to in this country, given unreasonable exemptions which amount to bending over backwards for religion, to the disadvantage of society in general.",

   "Legal exemptions from standards that have no conflict with religious activity, for one...\n In 1997, George Bush, who was the governor, pushed through legislation that exempted faith-based day care centers and addiction treatment programs from state licensing, allowing them to be monitored instead by private associations controlled by pastors, program directors and other private citizens. Other laws enacted on his watch steered more state financing to these \"alternatively accredited\" institutions.\n \n Fewer than a dozen child care centers and about 130 addiction treatment programs took advantage of this new alternative, according to subsequent studies. But several of these later became the focus of state investigations into complaints of physical abuse. A study by the Texas Freedom Network Education Fund, a nonprofit research organization that opposed the faith-based initiatives, found that \"the rate of confirmed cases of abuse and neglect at alternatively accredited facilities in Texas is more than 10 times that of state-licensed facilities.\"\n \n In spring 2001, the Texas Legislature quietly allowed the alternative accreditation program for day care centers to lapse.\n \n Two leading First Amendment scholars, asked about faith-based day care licensing exemptions like these, said they were unfamiliar with the practice but thought it sounded legally dubious. \"I think what you describe is unconstitutional,\" said Ira C. Lupu, a law professor at George Washington University and the co-director of legal research for the Roundtable on Religion and Social Welfare Policy, an independent project of the Rockefeller Institute of Government.\n \n Professor Witte, the director of Emory University's Center for the Study of Law and Religion, said in an e-mail response that he \"would frankly be surprised to find even this Supreme Court going that far.\"\n \n However, when a group of licensed day care centers challenged the Alabama law in a federal court in mid-2001, arguing that it deprived them of their constitutional right to equal protection before the law, the group lost. \n Religion isn't a victim.\n \n Can anybody give me ANY reason why religious day cares should be exempt from state day care standards and review, such that would prevent abuse?",
