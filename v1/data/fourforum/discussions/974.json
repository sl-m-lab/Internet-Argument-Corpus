It is better to challenge your own beliefs and reaffirm them than to never think for themselves. \n \n However, your sheep/shepherd anology has one problem. You say it as if it is a bad thing to follow the shepherd (begged question). The shepherd is the protector of the flock. Should a sheep wander off the shepherd goes looking. The shepherd fights off lions and other nasty carnivores (in older days gone by). That is a good thing, one would think. Especially if one considers God to bigger and more powerful and more knowing than ones self. \n \n You are correct that some christians have chosen to follow God based on fear. However, many have chosen to follow based on tasting his goodness. Now you may not believe that and that is your choice. I however, was not afraid of hell.

I have a friend who's behavior is unacceptable to me. That does not mean I do not accept him (or you just because you are different or have different beliefs). It is true that Christians do believe that they know the truth and that many others are deceived. That is not condescension. It would only be condescending if I were to say that makes me better. It does not. I am no better than anyone. Period! I am simply a blind squirrel that got an acorn. My opinion is that God showed me mercy and grace. Mercy, because he withheld what I deserved, and grace because he gave me what I did not deserve. \n \n Please do not lump all christians together. Many do interpret their knowledge as making them better, many wiccans do as well. It is a human condition not confined to religion, race, sex etc. Some people simply are that way. Christians are to love their neighbors as themselves. However, where Jesus says that in the New Testament follows the following statement, \"Love the lord with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength.\" Loving one's neighbor comes about from seeking God. \n \n Many Christians never go beyond that initial \"salvation experience\" and therefore never mature. It owuld be like me joining the YMCA and then hanging out there and never doing the exercises but eating the donuts or bagels or what have you. I grow fat and give the YMCA a bad name because people look at me and associate me with the Y. Christians sometimes do that. But DO NOT JUDGE GOD BY WHAT CHRISTIANS DO! Seek Him for yourself. If you are truly seeking truth and life you will find HIM. I truly believe this no matter what religion or beliefs you start with. THAT is keeping an open mind. \n \n Thank you for reading my ranting.",

   "Epaphras: i have only been posting here for a few days, but from what i have seen you have the ability to be objective and listen to others points of view, regardless of how much you disagree with it. i admire that. i certainly was not speaking of you in my previous posting, it was directed mostly at Mont. i do know that you cannot lable an entire group based on the behavior of a few...my words might have been strong on that behalf. but i do believe that Mont is making a bad image for his religion, and more importantly himself. i certainly could not hold the entire religion fault for that. \n \n Mont: i understand that you do not like the Wiccan beliefs...or any others that do not match your own for that matter. i try not to attack your systems of belief, after all, to each his own. i respect the fact that you have different beliefs than i do, even though i might not share those beliefs. this concept is called tolerance. (something you might want to look up) i have very little respect for someone who attacks something he does not understand. if you desire to learn nothing of Wicca, then please do not. like i said, i respect your right to believe anything you like, but do not speak of others beliefs in a condescening way if you do not first understand them. i was educated as a christian, i have read the bible, and i attended a catholic church until i was 22 years old. i might not have the knowledge level that you do about christianity, but i know enough to speak intelligently about it. i do not attack you, your beliefs, or your religion. i attack your lack or tolerance and lack of respect for others beliefs. i do recall the parable about the plank / splinter in the eye.",
