   "Europeans do some wacky things, but this one is just plain insane. I'm amazed that this even made the ballot. \n \n \n\n Swiss reject giving abused animals a lawyer\n 70 percent vote against idea; taxpayer cost cited as possible factor\n \n updated 2:04 p.m. ET, Sun., March. 7, 2010 \n GENEVA - The result was emphatic: Swiss voters don't think abused animals need to have their own lawyers.\n It's a proposal that would never even come near a referendum in other countries, but the measure's defeat Sunday disappointed animal rights advocates, who say Switzerland's elaborate animal welfare laws aren't being enforced.\n Opponents of the proposal, including key farmers' groups and the government, had argued that existing laws are sufficient and appointing special lawyers to act on behalf of animals would be unnecessarily expensive for taxpayers.\n \"The Swiss people have clearly said our animal protection laws are so good we don't need animal lawyers,\" Jakob Buechler, a lawmaker for the centrist Christian People's Party, told Swiss television SF1.\n Official results showed that 70.5 percent of voters cast their ballot against the proposal to extend nationwide a system that has been in place in Zurich since 1992. Some 29.5 percent of voters backed the proposal, with turnout at just over 45 percent.\n According to the country's only animal lawyer, Antoine Goetschel, public prosecutors are often unsure about animal rights and shy away from pursuing cases even if there is clear evidence of abuse. He said the cost of Sunday's measure would have been less than 1 Swiss franc ($1) per person a year.\n Tiana Angelina Moser, a lawmaker for the Green Liberal Party, said animal rights advocates would look for other ways to make sure laws against animal abuse are properly applied and those who hurt animals receive appropriate punishment.\n \"It's definitely disappointing, I thought it would have been a closer vote,\" said Moser. \"I don't think it's a 'no' to animal protection, but a 'no' for this particular measure.\"\n ......\n But in one high-profile case last month, Goetschel represented a dead pike after an animal protection group accused the angler who caught it of cruelty for taking 10 minutes to haul the fish in.\n The angler was found not guilty.\n Lawyers for abused pets?
