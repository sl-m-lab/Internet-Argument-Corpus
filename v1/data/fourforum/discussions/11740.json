He understands that it's only safe to insult people who will pray for him rather than those who will seek blood revenge for their cult leader and false prophet. \n \n Beside that, we must understand that the only reason the World hates Jesus as it overlooks these other belief systems as a threat to them is because the darkness hates the light, and the world exemplifies the spiritual darkness which ONLY Jesus overcame with His sacrifice on Calvary's Cross. That is why the World hates christianity and considers it such a threat.\n \n What atheists like penfold don't see or understand as they claim to be free from religion, is that they are defending the enemy of truth. They think they can remain separate from this spiritual battle but they have simply chosen to support and defend the losing side. \n \n What people like penfold hate to be reminded of is that ultimate justice will be forthcoming when all is said and done in this life. emoticon_rolleyes",

I was called out nearly a year ago by this same guy for referring to my own people as moslems. Yes, I was born into Islam which explains why my name is Ali. I accepted Jesus at 22 years old. And this schmuck had the nerve to tell me that being called a moslem was an insult. \n \n He doesn't realize that before radical islam made its appearance and American's found islam noteworthy at all, there were 2 types of islamic pronunciations, people like me who were born into islam were moslems, and then there was the American based African American religious group, Nation of Islam, led first by Elijah Mohammed, then Malcom X, and now by Louis Farrakhan. They have always been referred to as Black Muslims. \n \n Only since radical islam has been gentilized so to speak and the terminology dumbed down for the average American have all moslems and muslims been categorized as MUSLIMS in the pop culture lexicon. But like you, I still accurately distinguish between the two, and your middle eastern islamics are still accurately called MOSLEMS according to those in the know, just as they refer to themselves that way. And penfold knows that from our previous debate when I educated him of this fact. Yet again, he attempts to make a fallacious issue of it with you here, proving once again that people like him argues for the sake of argument, never to further the interest of truth or knowledge. \n \n Notice here, the American Moslem Foundation, which has been established for many decades proudly refers to itself as MOSLEM, proving that the so called politically correct term of muslim is a modern interpretation designed to offer some form of artificial respect which has nothing at all to do with how people actually regard islam at all.\n \n And HERE is an explanation of why it has become politically correct to use muslim over moslem by people like penfold who think nothing of insulting christians in every post while fearfully respecting and honoring the belief system which so proudly oppresses its own people and brings terrorism to the free world. God forbid we should refer to them with a word that denotes an oppressor. :xbanghead",

He was righteously indignant that the Jews were disrespecting His Fathers house and using it to do commerce rather than honor God. Jesus was offended precisely because He was here representing another kingdom, a spiritual kingdom which isn't an earthly kingdom at all, but is in Heaven. \n \n So once again, the very implication that Barrack Obama with all of the very questionable characters he has been associated with in his lifetime, and the admitted alcohol, pot and cocaine use he has participated in, and the very questionable activities he has been linked to means that comparing him to Jesus in any way is at the least insulting to Jesus, and more likely blasphemy for such an obvious low life like Obama to be compared to the Saviour of humanity and the Lord of Hosts.

Nor am I debating his intentions or justifying the lack of tolerance by the Romans. However - from the perspective of the Romans he was causing trouble at a tense time, and was certainly enough to get him crucified. Just talking history here.\n\n \n And again you are absolutely wrong, both in practical and historical terms. If Jesus was truly guilty of breaking Roman Law and was deserving of crucifixion, which was a Roman method of execution, then either Herod or Pilate would have willingly sentenced Him to death. But Pilate rejected the case and sent Him to his superior, King Herod. And after reviewing the case, he sent Jesus back to Pilate who then offered the Jewish people a choice. To execute Barabbas or Jesus and they chose to crucify Jesus, the innocent one.\n \n Because the Romans wanted to avoid a revolt Pilate agreed to their demands, but not before making the statement which has survived for 2000 years and become a part of the lexicon of cliche's; \"Let His blood be on your hands, I wash my hands of this mans fate.\"\n \n Matthew 27:19 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, \"Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him.\" 20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death. 21 But the governor said to them, \"Which of the two do you want me to release for you?\" And they said, \"Barabbas.\" 22 Pilate said to them, \"Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?\" They all said, \"Crucify Him!\" 23 And he said, \"Why, what evil has He done?\" But they kept shouting all the more, saying, \"Crucify Him!\" \n 24 When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, \"I am innocent of this Man's blood; see to that yourselves.\" 25 And all the people said, \"His blood shall be on us and on our children!\" 26 Then he released Barabbas for them; but after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified.\n So according to the Roman authorities involved in judging Jesus, He had done nothing worthy of death at all. He gave the mob what they wanted for political expediency. Much like the political party you support today would do if they were in a similar political situation. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Then why not just say that without quoting me?\n\n \n Cuz your quote inspired me to comment. \n ___________________________________________\n \n Archangel, the gospel's sympathetic portrayal of Pilate is sweet, but I don't buy it. The Romans were bastards and not lenient with trouble makers and secular historical documentation describes Pilate as brute who hated the Jews. Also, Herod was a Jew - he did not have the power to execute anyone. And are you saying that Herod was Pilot's or Jesus' superior (seriously not clear)? There is no way that a foreigner, even a foreign king, would out-rank the Roman representative in the area.\n \n Please understand me here, Archangel. I find this interesting from a historical point of view ONLY and the Bible, although an impotant historical document, is not the only one and is not a history book.\n \n If you are intested in discussing the history that is fine. If you are going to preach or tell me I am sou-less or some such thing - never mind.",
