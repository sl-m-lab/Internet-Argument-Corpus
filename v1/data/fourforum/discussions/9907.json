Willingham1 & Thomas R. Gingeras1 About the authors\n \n Top of pageAbstractRecent evidence of genome-wide transcription in several species indicates that the amount of transcription that occurs cannot be entirely accounted for by current sets of genome-wide annotations. Evidence indicates that most of both strands of the human genome might be transcribed, implying extensive overlap of transcriptional units and regulatory elements. These observations suggest that genomic architecture is not colinear, but is instead interleaved and modular, and that the same genomic sequences are multifunctional: that is, used for multiple independently regulated transcripts and as regulatory regions. What are the implications and consequences of such an interleaved genomic architecture in terms of increased information content, transcriptional complexity, evolution and disease states?\n \n View At a Glance\n Top of pageAuthor affiliations\n Affymetrix, Inc., 3420 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, California 95051, USA.\n Correspondence to: Thomas R.

Wagner1 About the author\n \n Top of pageAbstractHomology is an essential idea of biology, referring to the historical continuity of characters, but it is also conceptually highly elusive. The main difficulty is the apparently loose relationship between morphological characters and their genetic basis. Here I propose that it is the historical continuity of gene regulatory networks rather than the expression of individual homologous genes that underlies the homology of morphological characters. These networks, here referred to as 'character identity networks', enable the execution of a character-specific developmental programme.\n \n Top of pageAuthor affiliations\n G\u00fcnter P.
