   "Columbia\n \n By Langston Hughes\n \n Columbia, \n My dear girl, \n You really haven't been a virgin for so long. \n It's ludicrous to keep up the pretext. \n You're terribly involved in world assignations \n And everybody knows it. \n You've slept with all the big powers \n In military uniforms, \n And you've taken the sweet life \n Of all the little brown fellows \n In loincloths and cotton trousers. \n When they've resisted, \n You've yelled, \"Rape,\" \n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n Being one of the world's big vampires, \n Why don't you come on out and say so \n Like Japan, and England, and France, \n And all the other nymphomaniacs of power \n Who've long since dropped their \n Smoke screens of innocence \n To sit frankly on a bed of bombs? \n \n * Columbia is the first popular and poetic name for the United States of America; it is also the origin of the name for the District of Columbia, the federal district which is coextensive with the federal capital, Washington. Columbia is a feminine form derived from Christopher Columbus, one of the first Europeans to explore the Americas after the Vikings. The moniker dates from before the American Revolution in 1776 but fell out of use in the early 20th century.",

That's really irritating.\n \n I would ask for a link, but knowing you, you'd either abandon the thread or change the subject. So I won't bother. \n \n So instead I'll just reference John Huntsman, a man who once lived in a humble abode made of cardboard, who is now one of the wealthiest 400 Americans. Also, despite his greed as a rich person, he has donatated millions of dollars to finding a cure for cancer! :)\n \n Oh, well, your daughter is a greedy scumbag. How dare she try to make something of her life? How dare she? You're just making it more and more apparent to me that you're advocating equality of outcome, not equality of oppurtunity. What does she do for a living now? Does she make you proud? If you're so satisfied with her progress in life, then why are you screaming for the government to take her money? If not, are you ashamed of her success? Are you ashamed of her greed? Are you ashamed that she worked? \n \n For that matter, if she inherited your political veiws, does she advocate the same policies you do? Does she want the government to take her money, like a thousand other ###### in Hollywood? You see Oprah Wimfrey, Michael the Hutt, and Nosy O'Donnell stepping up and saying \"Here I am! Come take my money!\"\n \n Or the other conclusion is that your daughter's a failure. Despite her greed-based education that you seem so proud of, she ultimately ended up flipping burgers, collecting welfare, or selling herself on street corners. You feel that life might be worth living if the government took from people who actually work and give money to the former class clowns and welfare slugs. I find so ironic when you say that rich people lack patriotism because they pay taxes that you find loose, yet you scream for the government to lower your taxes.\n \n I am a middle-class citizen. I don't live in a masion and I don't have a garage full of brand-new cars. But I am one of the few who still completely understand and follow the doctrine Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country. You, comrade, have forgotten that long, long ago. I can tell by the left's screaming of \"Give me money!!!\" like a foul taste in my mouth. You're like a typical American that you see these days; you live in a fantasy world and you think your life sucks so bad. You scream and yell that your healthcare benefits aren't as good as you want them to be when you don't even give the millions who don't have healthcare a second thought. You're spoiled, just like everyone else in this country. You expect your government to be a nanny rather than a leader, and when it tries to be a leader you make it a scapegoat.\n\n My word! I've just taken note of how filled with hate you are!\n \n Are you also a terrorist and assassin?",
