   "Destroying the theory of evolution -- which has no-doubt had trillions of hours of intellectual thought devoted to it -- is one of my greatest pleasures. It's simply a pleasure making it look so ridiculous. And it's becoming easier and easier to hone in on exactly what's going on. I invite any debates on the following:\n \n You darwinists have gotten yourselves into quite a mess. For decades you've been conning people that evolution proceeds gradually by way of point mutations and natural selection. This, of course, implies that nature proceeds by a wasteful trail-and-error system that is neither efficient nor economical. In fact, this concept says nature gets almost everything wrong the first time. Of course this is a theory that was never grounded on any actual science -- it was grounded simply on materialists' desire to show how life is based on a foundation of accidents. \n \n But the truth always comes out...the way animals change is not by point mutations, but by regulatory changes during development. Of course gene regulation is not an accidental process...which undermines evolutionists' whole worldview. It also undermines natural selction because NS was set up to be the mechanism for adapting populations of animals to their enviornment....instead, we now have each individual animal adapting himself to the enviornment. Not only does it take randomness out of life, but it would also explain why we don't see too many animals walking around with two heads, 27 toes or long-flowing purple hair or other freaks of nature. \n \n This process also differs in that physiological change stems from a self-directing, internal cause arising from within the organism. It would also make what appears to be immediate \"jumps\" in the fossil record -- which fits in nicely with what's been reported. It's also a natural, orderly process that plays out possible variations on a theme, making the organism not inherently stupid and clueless, but more like a creative artist. Finally, it just makes sense....it makes physiological change smooth, simple and economical, with minimal waste (death.) \n \n Of course the backbreaker here for darwinists is that this proves that the mental/spirtual rules over the physical. It proves that it's the intrinsic properties that explain life. Life and morphology will never be explained by physical accidents. When an animal adapts to its environment, the first step is not an accidental change in a single structure, it's a wholistic phenomenon that begins with an intelligent \"idea\" or \"sensation.\" Of course ideas and sensations stem from thoughts and feelings -- both of which materialists hate and wish to ignore when it comes to science. \n \n But now you evolutionists have a choice -- and I'm curious as to what you choose.....you can stick to the Dawkin's plan of accidental populational changes culled by NS, or you can choose the self-directing, purposeful alternative that excludes gradualism, natural selection, and random mutations. This choice would also imply that what we see in the fossil record is not a build-up of parts, but simply morphological variations of a theme, dictated by the whole's interaction with environmental influences. Finally, it would be a version of change that could be verified in the laboratory or in the field with simple experiments. \n \n Finally -- and most destructively to evolutionists -- variation stemming from within the individual is not a source of evolutionary change as Darwinists think it is...it's merely a function that allows a species to adjust ecologically without extinction......This, of course, is the death stake for ToE.\n \n So which is it? Which version do you like? -- and don't say both...that would be non-intellectual ---- and certainly non-scientific...............you could never have a purposeful, yet accidental process at the same time....you could never have the parts rule over the whole while the whole rules over the parts at the same time....you could never have animals evolve gradually and punctually at the same time....you could never have point mutations and regulatory changes creating the same effect at the same time. You could never have a physiological effect created by new parts, yet created by a simple reorganization of existing parts at the same time. You could never have natural selection not working, yet working at the same time. You could never have an organism that is adaptive yet not adaptive at the same time. You could never have change guided from the outside of the organism (NS) yet from within the organism at the same time. You could never have purpose, charm and beauty in nature, yet disorganization, randomness and ugliness at the same time.\n \n You have to choose! -- So which is it?",

   "Destroying the theory of evolution -- which has no-doubt had trillions of hours of intellectual thought devoted to it -- is one of my greatest pleasures. It's simply a pleasure making it look so ridiculous.\nSo you are more knowledgeable about biology than all of the biologists who have spent their lives studying the topic? You have repeatedly demonstrated you ignorance and many of us have repeatedly instructed you in the fundamentals of biology and science, and yet you claim to know more than real scientists?\n \nDunning-Kruger effect, anyone?\nYes. That's it exactly!\n \nYou darwinists have gotten yourselves into quite a mess. For decades you've been conning people that evolution proceeds gradually by way of point mutations and natural selection.\nThere's much more to it than that. There are several different kinds of genetic changes that are called mutations. Evolution is not limited to the effects of point mutations alone. Why don't you demonstrate your competence to discuss this topic by defining a point mutation, and then name and define several other kinds of mutation.\n \n And, of course, there are other mechanisms that increase the genetic variability in any population besides mutation. On the other hand, there are mechanisms that tend to reduce the variability in a population in addition to natural selection. Please name and explain at least 4 others in order that you do not continue to look like a fool.\n \nThis, of course, implies that nature proceeds by a wasteful trail-and-error system that is neither efficient nor economical.\nOf course, you are implying that there is some magic being that is guiding the process in order to eliminate what you call wasteful trial-and-error. It seems that you have little understanding of what natural selection is even though you tell us repeatedly that it is how evolution proceeds.\n \n Moreover, you keep referring to Darwinism and Darwinists. By those terms do you actually mean Darwin's original theories (Mayr specifies 5 in \"On the Origin of Species\"? Do you discount genetics that was not joined to evolutionary theory until the 20th Century to form the modern synthesis? Are you really talking about neo-Darwinism and just being careless. By the way, why don't you demonstrate your competence to discuss this topic by naming 4 other theories of evolution besides natural selection that were discussed by Darwin in \"Origin\".\n \nIn fact, this concept says nature gets almost everything wrong the first time.\nNo it doesn't. The theory states that in the genome of any population there are variations that may be advantageous or disadvantageous in any given environment. There is not thought to design a perfect organism. We know that sometimes whole lineages of organisms have gone extinct when they lacked the genetic variability to allow adaptation. Only religious nuts would see perfection in every organism rather than the great variety that is there.\n \nOf course this is a theory that was never grounded on any actual science -- it was grounded simply on materialists' desire to show how life is based on a foundation of accidents.\nThe theory that you represent isn't grounded in any actual science, that is true. But you are presenting a straw man based on a fundamental misunderstanding of both science and evolutionary theory, as well as a religiously twisted view of nature.\n \nBut the truth always comes out...the way animals change is not by point mutations, but by regulatory changes during development. Of course gene regulation is not an accidental process...which undermines evolutionists' whole worldview. It also undermines natural selction because NS was set up to be the mechanism for adapting populations of animals to their enviornment....instead, we now have each individual animal adapting himself to the enviornment. Not only does it take randomness out of life, but it would also explain why we don't see too many animals walking around with two heads, 27 toes or long-flowing purple hair or other freaks of nature.\nThat doesn't actually require an answer since it is nothing but unfounded assertion followed by a bit of nonsense based on a distorted understanding of science, biology, and evolutionary theory. By the way, natural selection explains quite well why you don't see too many two headed animals (only in captivity if they are survive) or other freaks. Such changes are non-adaptive. However, your fantasy of gene regulation doesn't explain why there are no freaks. Why would two headed organisms be eliminated under your fantasy? Just think, they can look in two directions at once or eat twice as much in any given time span.\n \n By the way, the words are spelled \"environment\" and \"selection\".\n \nThis process also differs in that physiological change stems from a self-directing, internal cause arising from within the organism.\nMore unfounded assertion.\n \nIt would also make what appears to be immediate \"jumps\" in the fossil record -- which fits in nicely with what's been reported. It's also a natural, orderly process that plays out possible variations on a theme, making the organism not inherently stupid and clueless, but more like a creative artist.\nSo now you want to demonstrate that you are also ignorant of the fossil record?\n \nFinally, it just makes sense....it makes physiological change smooth, simple and economical, with minimal waste (death.)\nActually, it makes sense only to you. If you look at nature for just a little while, you willl become aware of a great deal of death. But it is mostly very economical since scavengers make sure that there is minimal waste.\n \nOf course the backbreaker here for darwinists is that this proves that the mental/spirtual rules over the physical. It proves that it's the intrinsic properties that explain life.\nNow you show that you haven't got the slightest idea about logic either. You have to actually have evidence in favor of your position. Assertions just make you look foolish.\n \nLife and morphology will never be explained by physical accidents. When an animal adapts to its environment, the first step is not an accidental change in a single structure, it's a wholistic phenomenon that begins with an intelligent \"idea\" or \"sensation.\" Of course ideas and sensations stem from thoughts and feelings -- both of which materialists hate and wish to ignore when it comes to science.\nEmpty assertions. Nothing but claims without a shred of evidence.\n \nBut now you evolutionists have a choice -- and I'm curious as to what you choose.....you can stick to the Dawkin's plan of accidental populational changes culled by NS, or you can choose the self-directing, purposeful alternative that excludes gradualism, natural selection, and random mutations. This choice would also imply that what we see in the fossil record is not a build-up of parts, but simply morphological variations of a theme, dictated by the whole's interaction with environmental influences. Finally, it would be a version of change that could be verified in the laboratory or in the field with simple experiments.\nI choose to go with science that is built on actual observation, hypothesis, prediction and testing to form explanations for the mechanism that were observed. I do not choose to accept fantasies based on spiritualism and a belief in magic.\n \nFinally -- and most destructively to evolutionists -- variation stemming from within the individual is not a source of evolutionary change as Darwinists think it is...it's merely a function that allows a species to adjust ecologically without extinction......This, of course, is the death stake for ToE.\nAgain, no evidence. Just assertion.\n \nSo which is it? Which version do you like? -- and don't say both...that would be non-intellectual ---- and certainly non-scientific...............you could never have a purposeful, yet accidental process at the same time....you could never have the parts rule over the whole while the whole rules over the parts at the same time....you could never have animals evolve gradually and punctually at the same time....you could never have point mutations and regulatory changes creating the same effect at the same time. You could never have a physiological effect created by new parts, yet created by a simple reorganization of existing parts at the same time. You could never have natural selection not working, yet working at the same time. You could never have an organism that is adaptive yet not adaptive at the same time. You could never have change guided from the outside of the organism (NS) yet from within the organism at the same time. You could never have purpose, charm and beauty in nature, yet disorganization, randomness and ugliness at the same time.\n \n You have to choose! -- So which is it?\nAs I said, I'll pick science that is based on real data and real logic. I reject spiritualism and wishful thinking in order to support magic beings. I prefer to learn and adjust what I think I know according to well reasoned scientific work. I reject the process of accepting dogma without evidence and then trying to make reality fit.",

   "OK, so I had to look up the Dunning-Kruger effect on Wikipedia. Thank the \"God of one's belief\" for the internet. It's so true that those with little knowledge or aptitude in an area will overestimate their competence. This is especially evident in these evolution/creation debates. Isn't it frustrating to point something out, that is extremely well supported by those who dedicate their lives to studying the subject, only to have anti-evolutionists, or anti-Darwinists, insist upon their straw man depictions of evolution? It's even more ironic that they will then turn around and accuse \"Darwinists\" of presenting straw man arguments. I'm especially amazed that creationists, and their more sophisticated IDist cohorts, will still bring up Haeckel's drawings or Piltdown man. It's virtually impossible to discuss anything with someone who has little real knowledge, but who grossly overestimates their grasp of the subject.",
