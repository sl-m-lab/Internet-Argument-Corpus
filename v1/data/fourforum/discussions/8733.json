   "What do you see as the major flaw of the view opposite of your in regards to how abortion should be dealt with?\n\n If I understand your question correctly, you are asking pro-choice people to state what they think is the major flaw in the pro-life arguement and vice-versa. \n \n I think that the major flaw in the pro-life arguement is that they use slogans which may sound appealing but, on closer inspection, do not have much substance. \n \n For example, saying that \"life is precious\" may sound right but one has to analyze what one means by \"life\", which they mostly do not bother to do. When people hear \"life is precious\", people can relate because they see their own lives and those of their friends and loved ones as precious. However, the pro-life people extend that all the way back to the earliest fetus/embryo. I have seen posts of imaginary letters from that early fetus meant to elicit sympathy. This is anthropomorphising (attaching a personality where there is none) on a grand scale. They are imagining a baby with an innocent, helpless personality where there is in reality simply a growing body which will someday (around the third trimester) possess a mind, but not yet. They may have an arguement that the *potential* of that fetus is important (since, after all, we all started as fetuses) but the potentiality arguement is much less emotionally appealing and wins fewer converts than the arguement which appeals to people's imaginations in imagining a helpless, innocent, suffering baby. When it comes to the early fetus, that last arguement is an illusion - imagination is not reality. Reality is what is important.\n \n A second, more minor, point against the pro-life arguement is that they often cannot help but mix in their views on sexual morality into their case against abortion. Many would give exceptions in the case of rape and incest because they feel sympathy toward those women. They have no sympathy toward women who chose to have sex.",

She is a care giver, and that child needs that care to survive.\n \n I believe quite firmly that no one should be required to provide care against their will. If they choose to provide that care, and then choose to stop providing that care, they should take all reasonable steps to ensure someone else assumes the role of care giver.\n \n For example, if a carer at a mental home has a personal emergency and has to leave, then he should attempt to call in any on-call staff, try and get the next rostered person to come in early, or so on. After he's taken all reasonable steps, he is free of an obligation to stay.\n \n Or if a mother can no longer handle caring for her children, she should attempt to get a friend or babysitter to care for them, or give them up to the state.\n \n Or if a pregnant woman no longer wishes to carry her baby. Unfortunately, in that instance, it is unlikely that anyone will be in a position to assume the role of caregiver.\n \n However, regardless of the eventual fate of the person recieving care, no person should be required, no person should be forced to provide care against their will. They should be able to abandon that person, provided they take all reasonable steps to ensure someone else assumes the role of care giver.\n \n Needless to say, I don't consider a pregnancy to be a 'reasonable step'.",

My views are that abortion should be legal in cases of rape or incest, and I have less concern with it early in the pregnancy, such as the 1st trimester. But am definitely against it after that. I can confidently say the things you listed aren't the way I believe, and aren't the way most anyone I know believes that's pro-life. I also think more effort should be made to help mothers who choose to have their baby than is given, particularly single women. Some in the PL movement haven't always been very good in this way. I think the pro-choice movement sometimes portrays prolifers the way you described--in the most extreme picture as possible. But it's not usually that way from what I've seen. BOTH sides have done too much smearing propaganda at times, and it has polarized things a lot.\n \n \nSure they are focused on the mother...just not in what I call a positive, empathatic, caring way.\n\n \n Many times they are empathetic to the mother too--they just don't compromise by agreeing the baby should be killed. I know a guy who runs a counselling service that helps mothers find a way to avoid abortions. They go to great lengths to help mothers support the baby whether that adoption or raising it. This is an example of pro-lifers giving support to the mother. The oft-used pro-choice generalization that \"pro-lifers don't care about women\" is a generalization. Many do. They can care about women and still believe it is wrong to kill a baby.\n \n \nI have never, ever seen, heard or written anything like this in my years of interest on this subject.

Pro lifers most certainly invoke religion in their campaign against abortion much more often than prochoicers.\n\n \n I've heard the arguments, but no I'm not saying they are equal in terms of frequency of use. Nevertheless, there's nothing wrong with religion being a defining force behind one's views. Religion, at the end of the day, is simply ideology. And ideology is usually behind anyone's views. When religious people argue their points because of their religion, it's just ideologically-driven debate--that's what everyone does. We ALL argue because of whatever ideology we have, religious or not. At the end of the day it all goes back to people's personal moral views, and whether that's influenced by religion or not shouldn't matter. Everyone has their reasons for their views.",

I do not know how successfully it was done but women were using herbal aborfacients at that time:\n \n \nHistory of contraception\n Probably the oldest method of contraception is coitus interruptus. In this method man completely removes his penis from the woman\"s vagina before he ejaculates. Also various herbal aborfacients have been used throughout human history. Some of them were effective, some were not. Woman have drunk solutions containing mercury, arsenic or other toxic substances for example herbs tansy and pennyroyal, but these also poisoned the woman. Chemicals dameged the liver, kidneys and the others organs. However in those times where risk of mathernal death from postpartum complications was high, the risk and side effects of toxic medicines may have seemed less onerous. Another of the earliest attempts at contraception centred on the use of physical barriers that stopped sperm from reaching the ovum. There are historic records of egyptian woman using pessary made from crocodile dung. Asian woman have used oiled paper as cervical cap and europeans may have used beeswax for this purpose. The condom appeared sometimes in 17th century. It was made of a lenght of animal intestine. Their widespread availability today both as a contraceptive and a barrier to sexual transmitted diseases was first pioneered by Margaret Sanger in America and Marie Stopes in Britain. They both overcame strong social and religious opposition to make contraception freely available so that woman could choose whan they want to be pregnant.\n\n \n http://referaty.atlas.sk/cudzie-jazyky/anglictina/22867/contraception",

These include vigorous exercise, carrying abnormally heavy weights, leaping violently (also recommended by Hippocrates), and a process of being shaken by wild or even controlled animals, as in taking a carriage ride driven over rough terrain. Soranus (Bk.I, Ch. XIX) prescribes walking energetically for 30 days after conception, followed by violent exercises to abort the fetus. Although these methods seem unnecessarily violent and even painful compared to today's methods, they were believed to be effective means of abortion during the ancient world.

Numerous methods of abortion were used, \"the more effective of which were exceedingly dangerous\". Several common methods involved either either dosing the pregnant woman with a near-fatal amount of poison, in order to induce a miscarriage, introducing poison directly into the uterus, or prodding the uterus with one of a variety of \"long needles, hooks, and knives\". Unsurprisingly, these methods often led to the death of the woman, as well as the fetus.\n \n There have been archaeological discoveries which would seem to indicate early surgical attempts at the extraction of a fetus; however, such methods are not believed to have been common, given the infrequency with which they are mentioned in ancient medical texts. Many of the methods employed in early and primitive cultures were non-surgical. Physical activities like strenuous labour, climbing, paddling, weightlifting, or diving were a common technique. Others included the use of irritant leaves, fasting, bloodletting, pouring hot water onto the abdomen, and lying on a coconut shell which had been heated.\n \n References in classical literature\n Hippocrates, the Greek physician whose famous Oath forbids abortion, nonetheless writes of having advised a dancer and prostitute who fell pregnant to jump up and down, touching her buttocks with her heels at each leap, so as to induce miscarriage. [7] Other writings attributed to him describe instruments, fashioned to dilate the cervix and curette inside of the uterus, which he used to perform an abortion upon one of his patients.\n \n Tertullian, a 2nd and 3rd century Christian theologian, also described surgical implements which were used in a procedure reminiscent of the modern dilation and evacuation. One tool had a \"nicely-adjusted flexible frame\" used for dilation, an \"annular blade\" used to curette, and a \"blunted or covered hook\" used for extraction. The other was a \"copper needle or spike\". He attributed ownership of such items to Hippocrates, Asclepiades, Erasistratus, Herophilus, and Soranus.\n \n Tertullian's description is prefaced as being used in cases in which abnormal positioning of the fetus in the womb would endanger the life of the pregnant women. Saint Augustine, in Enchiridion, makes passing mention of surgical procedures being performed to remove fetuses which have expired in utero. [10] Aulus Cornelius Celsus, a 1st century Roman encyclopedist, offers an extremely detailed account of a procedure to extract an already dead fetus in his only surviving work, De Medicina.\n \n In Book 9 of Refutation of all Heresies, Saint Hippolytus of Rome, another Christian theologian of the 3rd century, wrote of women tightly binding themselves around the middle so as to \"expel what was being conceived.\"\n \n Soranus, a 2nd century Greek physician, provided some rather detailed suggestions in his work Gynecology. He recommended that women wishing to abort their pregnancies should engage in violent exercise, energetic jumping, carrying heavy objects, and riding animals. Diuretics, emmenagogues, enemas, fasting, and bloodletting, were also prescribed, although Soranus advised against the use of sharp instruments to induce miscarriage due to the risk of organ perforation.",

   "I consider myself a centrist pro-lifer. My views are that abortion should be legal in cases of rape or incest, and I have less concern with it early in the pregnancy, such as the 1st trimester. But am definitely against it after that. I can confidently say the things you listed aren't the way I believe, and aren't the way most anyone I know believes that's pro-life. I also think more effort should be made to help mothers who choose to have their baby than is given, particularly single women. Some in the PL movement haven't always been very good in this way. I think the pro-choice movement sometimes portrays prolifers the way you described--in the most extreme picture as possible. But it's not usually that way from what I've seen. BOTH sides have done too much smearing propaganda at times, and it has polarized things a lot.\n\n \n Could you be specific about what you, as a \"centered\" pro-lifer, would like to see legislation-wise in regards to first trimester abortions?\n \n I agree with many of your sentiments. I would like to \"combine\" forces and do what we can to reduce the need for abortions. \n \n It does appear however that the more extreme prolifer arguments get the attention. Same w/ prochoice. Squeaky wheel...\n And my original assertions-- such as the desire to legislate morality for the masses; the selfish need to get involved intimately in the life of someone you will most likely never meet or be in a position to help-- still stand because these are the results of the prolife mvt as a whole. If you do not wish to legislate your morality to the masses, and if you think it is wrong to get intimately involved on such a personal level in a strangers' life, then your position needs reconsidered b/c this is ultimately what happens.\n \n \n \nMany times they are empathetic to the mother too--they just don't compromise by agreeing the baby should be killed. I know a guy who runs a counselling service that helps mothers find a way to avoid abortions. They go to great lengths to help mothers support the baby whether that adoption or raising it. This is an example of pro-lifers giving support to the mother. The oft-used pro-choice generalization that \"pro-lifers don't care about women\" is a generalization. Many do. They can care about women and still believe it is wrong to kill a baby.\n\n \n I don't think there is enough empathy and care for the woman if you are circumventing her options, opinions, and wishes by telling her she must carry a pregnancy to term.\n \n \nI've heard the arguments, but no I'm not saying they are equal in terms of frequency of use. Nevertheless, there's nothing wrong with religion being a defining force behind one's views. Religion, at the end of the day, is simply ideology. And ideology is usually behind anyone's views. When religious people argue their points because of their religion, it's just ideologically-driven debate--that's what everyone does. We ALL argue because of whatever ideology we have, religious or not. At the end of the day it all goes back to people's personal moral views, and whether that's influenced by religion or not shouldn't matter. Everyone has their reasons for their views.\n\n \n Of course there is nothing wrong w/ religion being a defining force behind someone's views. Or lack of religion. Whatever your ideology is you base your decisions on, that's fine and grand. However, there is something wrong when someone uses only their religious/ideology views, which are not shared by all, to legislate morality to everyone.",

No one can truly take away anyone's ability to do what they want (even if it's illegal). The goal of the pro-life movement is stop abortions. The end goal is not to make abortion illegal, though making it illegal is the means they seek to real their goal. The logic is straightforward: if our goal was to, say, stop homicides, we wouldn't do so by making homocide legal. The same applies to abortion. \n \n Frankly, you're arguing that it should be legal to kill a baby just so a mother can avoid discomfort. I agree women should be given care and empathy, but not at the expense of killing someone, which is where your logic goes. I think there needs to be BOTH--save the baby AND help the mother.

Everyone who votes, supports candidates, supports any given law, etc. is, in essence, trying to get their morality legislated. It's the way our system works. Everytime someone supports a law based on their personal beliefs and ideology, they are trying to see their morality legislated. Everyone does this based on ideology--I see no reason why religious people should not be allowed to do this when everyone else does it.",

Baby is not accurate. \n \n \n Well, sorry, but I have no interest in using only purely clinical terms to describe a fetus. (Though sometimes I use \"fetus\" as well.) If it's not accurate, then you need to tell that to every OB/GYN doctor that tells a hopeful mother that her \"baby is fine\". There's a reason they don't use the term \"fetus\"; because it's clinical and cold. There is basically no diffence in the development of a premature baby between the moment before it exits the birth canal and the moment after. It doesn't just then magically become a baby. (and that's why many people use the concept if viability-outside-the-womb as the point in the pregnancy where they feel abortion shouldn't be done.) I think many in the pro-choice movement prefer clinical terminology because it offers a certain disconnectedness. If it's called a \"baby\" then the risk is run of actually thinking of it in a personal way. IMO, using only clinical terminology is a coward's way out. If you are going to believe that abortion should be legal, then I say have the balls to face up to what you're really doing: killing a baby--someone that, if allowed to live, would grow into a todler, a child, an adolescent, and an adult. That may tick you off, but it's what I believe so take it or leave it. I'm not against you using the term \"fetus\", but don't chastise me for calling it a baby either.\n \n On the flipside, too many in the pro-life movement prefer to be disconnected from the issues the mother is facing. I think consideration for both the baby AND the mother is the best way. I think a lot more mothers would carry their baby to term if they know they had the support they needed, and/or the ability to know they they could give their baby up. In that sense, the pro-life goals of saving lives would be helped by actually giving more support to mothers.\n \n \nEnding someone's career aspirations or ruining someone's life is not discomfort.

In this day and time it is mostly rare for pregnancies to be truly threatening to a mother's health.

The worst thing to do however, is to kill the baby. There are cases where women truly DO have the meeting of their needs threatened, but most of the time the abortion debate is about killing versus lack-of-convenience/comfort. And that's what the pro-life movement has the biggest problem with. If it were truly about needs, I might be more inclined to agree with you, but abortion law doesn't take that into account at all.\n\n \n Need for the mother would be her realistic socioeconomic ability to cope with not only physical and emotional consequences of pregnancy, which should be her choice under any circumstance, plus 18 or so years of legal parental responsibility. In the US, society raising unwanted human spawn is still generally limited to accepted WASP heritage. \n \n You're stating termination of an undesired conception or probability of is subject to your moral definition of killing a human being and rationalizing that moral decision by blaming society for being remiss in not taking responsibility for the results of all unwanted conceptions.

She is a care giver, and that child needs that care to survive.\n \n I believe quite firmly that no one should be required to provide care against their will. If they choose to provide that care, and then choose to stop providing that care, they should take all reasonable steps to ensure someone else assumes the role of care giver.\n \n For example, if a carer at a mental home has a personal emergency and has to leave, then he should attempt to call in any on-call staff, try and get the next rostered person to come in early, or so on. After he's taken all reasonable steps, he is free of an obligation to stay.\n \n Or if a mother can no longer handle caring for her children, she should attempt to get a friend or babysitter to care for them, or give them up to the state.\n \n Or if a pregnant woman no longer wishes to carry her baby. Unfortunately, in that instance, it is unlikely that anyone will be in a position to assume the role of caregiver.\n \n However, regardless of the eventual fate of the person recieving care, no person should be required, no person should be forced to provide care against their will. They should be able to abandon that person, provided they take all reasonable steps to ensure someone else assumes the role of care giver.\n \n Needless to say, I don't consider a pregnancy to be a 'reasonable step'.",

It would be reasonable to expect her to ask a family member or baby-sitter to look after the kids.

   "The major flaw in the pro-choice camp is that pro-choice is based on selfishness. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Actually, its about womens rights, and liberty.\n \n If men had to go through what women did in pregnancy, then there would be no question about Pro-Choice Vs. Pro-Life, it would all be pro choice. But, sadly, women are the mistreated minority here, and are only viewd by PLs as child bearing cubicles instead of people.\n \n And the thing is, i have no problem with people thinking Pro-Life. They can run the most viscious ad campains and commercials, and preach against abortion at their hearts content. But what they CAN'T do is legislate their religious beliefs into laws. Separation of church and state is very important, and legislating Anti-Abortion laws would harm that. You can preach against abortion, and run anti-abortion commercials and such, but like i said before YOU CANNOT LEGISLATE IT INTO LAW!",

I am not sure I want to specifically select out stupid people to be parents. And even really responsible people occasionally make mistakes. It makes this medical issue a moralistic one.\n \n The big problem is this would be utterly unenforceable; how would you be able to discern how the pregnancy occurred (except in the case of assault), besides \"the honor system\".\n \n You have to know that to the extent that the morning after pill may prevent implantation of an embryo, some people feel it is abortion.
