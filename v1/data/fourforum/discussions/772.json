   "Forenote: We have to start with the presumption that the bible is infailable. (there is no literal/non-literal interpertations). if it is stated as fact and not proveb. then we have to assume it is fact. 7 days = 7 days (god would preseve the integrity of his word threw the same holy spirit that inspired it). Secoundly, we have to assume that God does not lie.\n \n So much infasis is put on the \"young earth theory\" (which is nearly impossible) that little attention is paid to the sun, star, and galaxies. Our sun is 6,000 years old? Our galaxy? all galaxy's for that matter: are only 6,000 years old? Not only do all suns have tremendiously different phases in there life, our sun is in the middle of its life (5 billion years old). So you have to believe that god made a 6,000 year old sun look like a 5 billion year old one. Trickery anyone? secoundly from a nuclear reacation stand point it would be impossible to burn up 5 billion years worth of hydrogen fuel in 6,000 years without destroying the earth. (\"sun atomic reactions\" when the force of gravity squezes 4 H (hydrogen) atoms togather they combine to = 1 He (helium) atom + large amounts of energy... e=mc^2). We can compare the H to He ratio's its a very exact sceince. the same that is used in nuclear weapons testing. \n \n If this still doesn't convience you..... galaxies. Light travels at a fixed speed as the theory of realtivity states (180,000 miles per sec). Light from distant stars travels to us (when you look at the night sky your seeing the past comming to you). If the sun were to blow up right ....... NOW!!!! you wouldn't see it for 8 min. everything would apear fine for 8 min then......... :) anyway if we could only see 6,000 miles worth of light ...... um we wouldn't be able to see outside of our own galaxy. much less the billions of galaxies we see now.\n \n \n If your going to refute this ask yourself 1 question. In your mind do you feel its \"us vs them/ athiest vs thiest\" are you fighting for a worthy instuition in your own mind? one that has killed countless people. arested the father of modern sceince because his veiws didn't agree with the biblical earth being the center of the universe and flat. or are you impeeding sceince and your own understanding of the universe? most all of \"us\" free thinkers where like you.... but then something happened. we ran into a bucket of knowledge and our curiosity drove us to want to find out more.. and the more we found out the more obvious it was to us. a curiosty your church undenable tries to crush. the sun clock is ticking (it doesn't shine forver), and we are constantly faced with new things that challenge our survival. and science/human unity are the only things that can save us. the crusades are over break down your \"berlin walls\" and join the rest of mankind in the search for truth.",
