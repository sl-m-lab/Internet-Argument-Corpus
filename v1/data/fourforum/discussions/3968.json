   "If you're like many people, your first reaction to learning that your loved one is gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender is \"How will I ever handle this?\" Many people aren't prepared for the words, \"I'm gay\", \"I'm lesbian\", \"I'm bisexual\", or \"I'm transgender.\"\n \n Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) is here for you. We hope to help you understand your loved one's sexual orientation or gender identity, and its meaning to you, and your relationship with them. Our members are parents, families and friends of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) people. We most likely have been through much of what you are now feeling. We understand.\n \n We can tell you with absolute certainty that you're not alone. According to some statistics, one in every ten people in this country and around the world is GLBT. Approximately one in four families has an immediate family member who is gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender, and most people have at least one gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender member in their extended circle of friends and family.\n \n This means that there are plenty of people out there you can talk to. We can tell you from our experience that talking about it really helps. There are books to read, telephone help lines to call and people to meet who, by sharing their own experiences, can help you move forward. And PFLAG can connect you with the information and support services you need.\n \n The second thing we can tell you is that - if you wish - you will emerge from this period with a stronger, closer relationship with your loved one than you have ever had before. That's been the case for all of us. \n \n But the path to that point is sometimes not easy. Some people are able to take the news in stride. But some of us went through something similar to a grieving process with all the accompanying shock, denial, anger, guilt and sense of loss. So, if those are the feelings with which you're dealing, they're understandable given our society's attitudes towards gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender people. Don't condemn yourself for the emotions you feel. But, since you love your GLBT friend or relative, you owe it to him or her - and to yourself - to move toward acceptance, understanding and support.\n \n While it may feel as if you have lost someone, you haven't. Your loved one is the same person he or she was yesterday. The only thing you have lost is your own image of that person and the understanding you thought you had. That loss can be very difficult, but that image can, happily, be replaced with a new and clearer understanding of your loved one. \n \n If your son or daughter, friend or relative \"came out\" to you voluntarily, you're probably more than halfway there already. Your loved one's decision to be open and honest with you about something many in our society discourage took a tremendous amount of courage. And it shows an equally tremendous amount of love, trust and commitment to their relationship with you. Now it's up to you to match their courage, commitment, trust and love with your own.\n http://www.pflag.org/index.php?id=84",

Even if she was living a lie, did you ever stop to think that maybe, just maybe she thought it was what was best for her and her family at that time?\n \n Maybe she waited to come out until she felt her son was old enough to handle the truth. Maybe her husband already knew and kept it secret to save the family. \n \n Or, maybe more like me, who always wondered, always questioned, but felt that getting married and having a family was what was EXPECTED of her. That only once her son reached a certain age did she finally accept her own sexuality and find her voice to express it. \n \n Jyoshu, you assume a lot but know very little. \n I can't say I know why the mother of the OP (original poster) did what she did, no more than you can. \n \n All I know are my own experiences. The hell I went through trying to figure out who I was and where I fit in society. \n There is one thing I'm sure of, that is the older a person is when they do \"come out\" the harder their decission to do so publicly will become. Mainly because of people like you who will imediately point fingers and call them liars, degrading their humanity even more than they probably already have in their own mind. \n \n This weeks \"West Wing\" brought up a very good point. One of the main characters was being rumored to be gay. What started out as an internet rumor quickly spread to the press, her co-workers, members of Congress and the Senate. She experienced whispered comments, suggestive \"gifts\" and muffled chuckles behind her back. \n Finally she had made a decission to put the issue to rest and make a formal statement denying the alligations of her homosexuality, which didn't exist. But, when the time came and the press directly asked her, she simply told them it was none of their business. \n She reminded them of the way she had been treated for the past couple of days simply because of their perception, wether or not it was true...which it wasn't. \n \n It's just that kind of mentality you are displaying by pointing your accusitory finger at the OP's mother. Even asking it in the form of a question sets everyone's mind in that pattern. \n It's dehumanizing and hurtful.\n Gays aren't demons, we are flesh and blood. We have emotions just like you. We have aspirations and hopes, just like you. \n \n What we are fighting for is to be treated with dignity and legal equality.",

And to be honest, I do not think it is possible to point out any harm that comes to anyone by performing that act, unless it is done in an irresponsible fashion. So assuming that these sexual relations are handled responsible, you are asking same-sex partners to abandon their own beliefs and follow your religious beliefs, not because they are harming anyone, but simply because you don't want them to follow their own beliefs.\n \n While the idea same-sex partners are not engaging in sexual activities may comfort you, you have to admit that it is a very unreasonable request. You are asking them to act against their own set of beliefs but providing no reason except that yours are different. I will further suggest that they can provide a reason that they should continue their activities: it makes them happy to do so. Perhaps that is a selfish reason, but certainly performing activites that make oneself happy and harm no one are worthy of performing, assuming one does not have a religous belief to say that the action is wrong.\n \n What I mean is that I understand your religious beliefs, and I can see why you would not want them to engage in sexual activites, but I don't think that your religious belief alone is a strong enough reason for any of those couples to do ask you ask.",

At least during his formative years. So, I shouldn't try to compare.\n But I am curious, did your mom just up and leave your dad or was there some discussion between them about her sexuality? I mean did they stay married for your sake and simply not acknoweldge her being a lesbian, or was it a shock to your dad as well? \n I think this would make a difference. \n I know a couple of couples (sorry for that) who have stayed together inspite of differences, just for the kids. One couple stayed together even though one had \"come out\" because both of them wanted children. And another couple stayed together because they already had one child even though both of them are gay. \n It's interesting to see how families cope with these issues. Not all are cookie-cutter copies of the \"Ozzie and Harriette\" ideal. Every family has it's own set of problems and circumstances. Some families tackle them head on with honesty and openness others sweep these things under the proverbial rug in hopes that if ignored they will just go away.",

Fewer than a handful of clicks on their website leads to this:\n \n <<If you're like many people, your first reaction to learning that your loved one is gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender is \"How will I ever handle this?\" Many people aren't prepared for the words, \"I'm gay\", \"I'm lesbian\", \"I'm bisexual\", or \"I'm transgender.\"<<\n \n Odd you couldn't find anything, jyoshu.
