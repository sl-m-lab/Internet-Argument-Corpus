   "OK, now that we have all had a chance to see it, lets rip it apart :)\n \n First, we all need to recognize exactly what the GOPS path to prosperity and Obamas deficit reduction plan are. They are not actually budgets. They will never be voted on. They are more like roadmaps. They propose current cuts, and propose future cuts. \n \n This is the big problem with both plans. In both cases, the majority of the cuts are future cuts...which means that the current congress and current president have no control whatsoever over whether or not they will ever be made. Both plans basically make little or no cuts now, and assume that politicians in the future will be a lot more fiscally responsible and will not want to be re-elected, so they will make these enormous cuts that pretty mush guarantee that they get hunted down and executed by torch carrying mobs. \n \n The other thing that needs to be remembered is that most of the \"savings\" they keep shouting about are largely hypothetical since they dont actually have any control at all over what programs get funded at what levels. Smaller scale example: I provide bottled water to the guys who work for me. It costs me about $70 a week. If I decided to no longer provide that water, I would save $3850 a year, or about $50,000 over 12 years (adjusted roughly for inflation). \n \n What both Obama and the Republicans are doing is asking us to go ahead and put that $50,000 in savings on the books now. The reality is that things may shrink or grow in the next 12 years. I may work more sites where there are convenience stores near by, in which case I dont usually bother to provide drinks, the guys prefer to get their own on break. I might stop being an idiot and buying bottled water and just sign a contract with culligan, which would cut the cost to only $31 a week.\n \n The point is that the $50,000 number is VERY hypothetical...just like the $4 trillion number that Obama and the GOP keep wanting you to put on the books in their \"deficit reduction\" column today. Real world, the actual number is probably much, much lower. It is like the $38 billion in \"reductions\" that they passed as part of their deal to finish out this years budget. Only about $320 million of that is saved THIS year, the rest is \"saved\" in future years, and about 90% of that is hypothetical money...money that would never have been spent anyway, so basically they actually cut about $320 million in total for real. \n \n I am not sure how they decided that $4 trillion was the magic number that would make our investors believe we were serious about fiscal sanity. That is not even $4 trillion off our current deficit, it is off the projected deficit 12 years in the future, so it is basically BS anyway.",

That is a bold faced Lie, it's actually only like 3%.. but that is beside the point.

If you were the chinese and saw us defaulting on treasuries that our own people hold, how much faith would you put in the treasuries that you hold???? \n \n Infrastructure is the really tricky part. I agree 100% that we have neglected our infrastructure and we need to do something about it. We just dont have the money. From a purely business standpoint, infrastructure spending should be relatively easy to fund since the projects pay for themselves over time, bond buyers should be willing to fund them.

It's lengthy when the entire time we coulda just had the state tax more and fix the freakin pipes per regulations provided by the EPA.

But They have never left them as they were intended. They have blown the Social Security Surplus like it was free money, both Republicans and Democrats. I remember when Clinton/Gore tried to pass that \" Lock Box\" bill where the Surplus would come off the table as a way to increase more spending. I also remember the GOP fighting this and making sure it didn't pass because they didn't want to see their Bank closed. \n \n No, Social Security and Medicare are Not our main problem. Well they might be now that we're in debt up to our eyes, but these programs were doing fine until we got mixed up in three wars and revenue was decreased so drastically. they had to find new ways to pay for other programs so they borrowed from Social Security to keep running a tab on everything else. Now they scream Social Security is costing us too much.. Well Duh.. they drove it in that direction. \n \n I'm not against cutting these programs, don't get me wrong..

   "So does defense but I'm fine cutting them in half. I'm a bit cynical on this though. For one, the biggest \"cuts\" I want for the EPA are not even EPA budgeted. These things include the \"Energy Star\" program and other BS tax things like that. I probably shouldn't call that EPA but I do. \n \n As for EPAs actual budget, I think a lot of what they do is better done at the state level anyway. They spend like $3.5 billion out of their total $13 or so billion on grants for states to fix the water pipes (aka repair infrastructure for clean water). The path is something like this...tax me to feds, state applies for grant, state receives grant from feds, state appropriates money to localities or other area to repair pipes, pipes are repaired, report to feds what happened. It's lengthy when the entire time we coulda just had the state tax more and fix the freakin pipes per regulations provided by the EPA. I'm perfectly happy with the feds saying \"your water pipes can't have huge rusty holes with a homeless man bathing in them\" and then enforcing that. \n \n And these are good things the EPA does but they account for a small part of their budget. I think over half their budget is just grants. \n \n The EPA would be fine with a 20% reduction PLUS the reduction for grants that the states can do themselves.\n\n \n I have no problem with those cuts to the EPA. I was afraid you were on the republican \"disband the EPA\" bandwagon. Frankly that is a BAD idea.",
