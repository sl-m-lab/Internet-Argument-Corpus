This is known as the division property of equality.\n \n Now, if a = x*0, b = 0, and c = 0, then (x*0)/0 = 0/0.\n For the first term, (x*0)/0 = x*(0/0).\n Therefore, instead of the equation x = 0/0, the correct equation is x*(0/0) = 0/0, not x = 0/0.\n \n Remember that for the next section.\n \nWatch this: I've picked a number real number; we'll call it x.\n x * 0 = 0\n Please divide 0 by 0 and tell me which real number x is.\n x may be zero, it may be not zero.

This either makes that side of the equation undefined or zero. x(0/0) does not equal x unless 0/0 = 1.\n \n Assuming 0/0 = 1 (or any other nonzero real number), I can show that 1 = 2.

That would be useful to know...\n \nThere is nothing greater than infinity.\n\n Bingo.

Anyway, my point was to show that 1/0 was unsolvable. Can we accept that and move on?\n \nTake a look at a pie. There are 6 slices and 2 people. You divide 6 by 2 and get 3 so each person gets 3 slices. Now there are 0 slices left. 2 more peoplee come and want pie. There are 0 slices and 2 people.

You can not divide by 0 when doing algebra such as this, otherwise I could do this.\n \n 4*x = 5*x\n 4x/0 = 5x/0\n infinity = infinity\n this is true so true for any x\n 4*1 = 5*1\n 4 = 5\n\n Therefore you can't multiply by zero, either. Watch:\n 4*x = 5*x\n 4x*0 = 5x*0\n 0 = 0\n So, for any x:\n 4*1 = 5*1\n 4 = 5\n \nYou can't divide by 0. That's the basis for all the \"proofs\" that 1=0, only they are better at hiding behind variables. \n\n I have not found such a proof that assumes that 0/0 = 0. I made one myself that assumes that it equals both 0 and 1, though.\n If you could show me such a proof that assumed that 0/0 = 0, I would stop arguing.\n \nYou just straight up divided by 0.\n\n I was quoting electrolyte:\n \nFor any number x, x*0 = 0. Therefore, dividing 0 by 0 should yield x. Clearly, it doesn't.\n\n My point was that dividing both sides by zero does not leave x alone in the first part. It leaves x(0/0).\n \nno. There's a real solution to a = x+5 (where a is any real number)\n \n For example:\n 0 = x+5\n x = -5.\n \n If you take the limit of x+5 as x approaches -5 from both sides you will get 0.\n\n My confusion was with two things: first, his using 0/x, and second, his asking for a solution for 1/x (updated). If x = 1, there is a solution. If x = 0, there is none. There is also a solution to x=5 when x = 42 (or any actual value).\n \n Anyway, that has been cleared up, so we can move on from that, too.\n \nInfinity is not a number you can do simple operations with. For example infinity+infinity = infinity\n infinity*infinity = infinity\n infinity-infinity does NOT equal 0 because they are not necessarily the same number. \n\n I know. Depending on various things, infinity-infinity can equal 2. That is fairly arbitrary.\n \nIf something equals infinity basically it means its limit increases without bound. for 1/x as x gets close to 0, give me any number and I can get x small enough to make 1/x equal that number. A billion, a trillion, 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999. I can do it. That's what it means for a limit to increase without bound which we say that expression equals infinity. Infinity is not a number, it's a concept.\n\n Yeah, electrolyte already made this point, and I think I will stop arguing about exactly why 1/0 is undefined. I am just trying to say that it makes sense to say that 0/0 = 0.",

   "Therefore, instead of the equation x = 0/0, the correct equation is x*(0/0) = 0/0, not x = 0/0.\n\n No, see, I follow you, but you're not showing anything.\n \n \nI cannot tell you what x is, because x is multiplied by (0/0).\n\n No it's not.

But your above \"proof\" showed that 0/0 is equal to one. In other words, by dividing by zero, you can prove that 0/0 is anything you want it to be. See below.\n \n \nI can understand it better in terms of 1/x.

Therefore 0/0 = whatever you want it to be.\nBy the way, what exact definiton do you use for division? That would be useful to know...\n\n Division is inverse multiplication.\n \n \nBingo.

But your above \"proof\" showed that 0/0 is equal to one. In other words, by dividing by zero, you can prove that 0/0 is anything you want it to be. See below.\n\n It did not show that 0/0 = 1; it assumed that.\n The proof also showed that if 0/0 is a nonzero real number, 1 = 2.\n We know that 1 does not equal 2, so therefore 0/0 is not a nonzero real number.\n \nThen you'll be able to work with 1/x and 2*(1/x):\n Assign f(x)=(1/x).\n Assign g(x)=(2/x).\n \n The limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity is 0.\n The limit of g(x) as x approaches infinity is 0.\n \n Now lets take the limit of f(x)/g(x) as x approaches infinity.\n \n lim (x app inf) 1/x = 0\n -------------------- ---\n lim (x app inf) 2/x = 0\n \n This is 0/0.

As far as I know, assuming only that 0/0 = 0 cannot produce a contradiction.\n \nDivision is inverse multiplication.\n\n That isn't very useful in discussing a topic which is not taken into account for standard proofs and properties of equality.\n Because almost every number divided by zero undeniably results in an impossibility, 0/0 tends to be ignored. However, I see nothing contradictory in 0/0.\n \nOr any other chosen number a/b.\n\n I know. However, reaching a contradiction is considered a proof that a given situation (0/0 is not equal to a nonzero real number, in this case) is true.\n \nAssuming what? That there is anything that can be divided by zero? Yes, it does! That's why you can't do it!\n\n Actually, assuming that 0/0 = 1 leads to contradictions. Again, assuming that 0/0 can only equal zero does not lead to such contradictions.\n \nThe fact that the bolded part doesn't throw up a red flag big enough to make you stop arguing is absolutely astounding.\n\n My \"proof\" requires that 0/0 equal both zero and one. If a contradiction can be found that assumes only that 0/0 = 0, that will be enough. A \"proof\" assuming that 0 = 0/0 = 1 is no good as a counterexample for 0/0 = 0.\n \nYes, it was an effective demonstration of why one cannot divide by zero.\n\n Usually, if you divide a number by itself, you end up with one. That is not the case with zero.\n I have shown that dividing 0x = 0 by zero does not result in 0/0 = x.\n \nMy point was that dividing both sides by zero does not leave x alone in the first part.\n\n It does when division is inverse multiplication, unless you have two different meanings of zero.\n\n I thought you said you understood this:1) Begin with 0x = 0.\n 2) Divide both sides of the equation by 0: 0x/0 = 0/0.\n 3) Simplify: x(0/0) = 0/0.Note that x(0/0) is not equal to x unless you assume that 0/0 = 1.\n Also, 0/0 does not equal 1. I have already shown that.\n \nBut it doesn't make sense to say that 0/0 = 0, or anything, because there are an infinite number of counterexamples to any one chosen solution.

   "As far as I know, assuming only that 0/0 = 0 cannot produce a contradiction.\n\n Let us wade through the sludge and get right to the point, since rather than address my major point at all, you simply repeated your assertion:\n \n 0/0 \"can\" equal anything. If you pick an x and assume that 0/0 = x, then there are an infinite number of counterexamples to disprove the assumption.\n \n You want x to be zero. You say this assumption leads to no contradictions, but you are demonstrably wrong. The limits approach clearly allows me to pick any number and show that 0/0 is equal to that number; I did so with 1/2 and 1/3. This is contradictory to your assumption, and no amount of whining will change that.\n If, as you desire, we assume that 0/0 = 0, then f(x)/g(x) in my previous example must equal 0. It didn't. This is a contradiction. Thus your special pleading begins: You use an approach that shows that 2=1, then reject the conclusion because two is obviously not equal to one. But you ignore the very same concept when I use it: Just as 2 is not equal to 1, 0 is not equal to one-half, and 0 is not equal to one-third.\n \n Worse, your own \"proofs\" show that you're wrong. First you \"prove\" that 0/0 must equal one. Then you \"prove\" that 0/0 must not equal one, and therefore it is zero. As 1 is not equal to 0, there is clearly something wrong with your proofs (namely that you're dividing by zero). As I said before, the fact that you seem to be blind to this is astounding.\n \n I'm done with you concerning this topic, Hi.

   "OK, a lot of people are getting on the OP for continuing to argue. That's a good way to learn. I hope he understood that according to the rules of math he was wrong. I do that a lot. \"I know I'm wrong, here's my reasoning, where am I wrong\". Then try to back up my position and usually we get to the flaw in my reasoning pretty quickly. 0/0 does not equal 0 (as in we can't replace 0/0 with 0 in an equation) and I've done my best so far to explain to him why, so that he understands it rather than just is told \"you're wrong, just accept it\". That is a horrible way to learn and you won't learn anything if that's the way you're taught. If you are still confused, feel free to ask questions. This is a debate site, but this is not a debate, but a mathematical discussion. Feel free to ask more if you still don't understand, and I'll do my best to explain. The basic concept is that it's not possible to divide 0 pieces of anything among 0 people. It's pretty much impossible to grasp, it really doesn't matter how many pieces each 0 people have, there's still a total of 0. So we've decided to label it as undefined. Hopefully you understand at least the basics of the reason division by 0 is undefined. It just doesn't make sense dividing stuff into 0 parts. You can take limits of values that approach 0/0 or a/0, but never take the actual value of 0/0 or a/0, those are simply undefined.",

   "\n Therefore you can't multiply by zero, either. Watch:\n 4*x = 5*x\n 4x*0 = 5x*0\n 0 = 0\n So, for any x:\n 4*1 = 5*1\n 4 = 5\n \n\n Sorry, I made a mistake. The reason this is true is that 0*a is equal to 0*b for any real a or b. To perform an operation on an equation it must be one-to-one (the reason why we must check for extraneous solutions when squaring both sides). So in an equation you can't multiply both sides by 0 either and maintain the equality. All I've proven is that division by 0 is not one-to-one. Which is why when we examine division by 0 the only way to do it is to use limits. You can multiply by a number infinitely close to 0, just not 0. So you get (something really close to 0)/(something really close to 0), but they are not necessarily the same number, otherwise you would have 1. Or you could do 0/(something really close to 0) in which case you would get 0. But if they are different they could be any number on the number line. The problem is this is fuzzy, it depends how you approach the problem as to what answer you will get, which is the primary reason we have just said that 0/0 is undefined, but when we examine 2 unique numbers infinitely close to 0 we could get any real number, which is why we say it is an indeterminate form.",
