   "We do have debates over smoking in pubs and restaurants though, and those are privately owned.\n\n \n To the extent that the government decides what is done with them or not, they are publically owned, or rather they fall under the fascist model you often endorse, where things are privately owned in name and generate private profit but are directed by an authoritarian state claiming to represent the will of the people.\n \n \nThis is far less arbitrary than the whim of one individual.\n\n \n So if an individual pizza buyer decides he wants anchovies on his pizza, that's \"arbitrary\" (not based on the fact he likes them or not, he just plucks it out of the air), but if government institutes a blanket rule forcing them onto all pizzas or none, that represents the \"will of the people\" (they don't have individual wills, of course, but once they form a government, a magical collective will appears)\n \n \nIf property is public then the ultimate decision maker is the collective will of the people\n\n \n We can call this the \"Fuehrer principle of democracy\". Undoubtedly this manifestation of divine will occurs on a national or racial level, and can thusly be called National Socialism. Why a national vote should take priority over one at a local, family or individual level is unclear, but perhaps this \"collective will\" is shared via the shared genetic code of the people willing it, and perhaps the will can be strengthened by purifying the nation.\n \n Is it not true that if the collective will is shaped by people with weakness - the ill or disabled, or lesser races, that the collective will itself will also be weakened? Is it not true that a collective will would seek to strengthen itself by purging this weakness?\n \n Seriously though, the government doesn't represent the will of the people. It represents, more often than not, corporate interests, and you then become an unwitting tool of them by declaring their actions are somehow the common man's dreams put into action. Undoubtedly were the \"public\" decision to be made about whether to put anchovies in pizzas, it would be Anchovy Manufacturing Corp that would spend millions lobbying to manipulate the \"will of the people\".",

   "There is no problem in teaching intelligent design in school as long as it is consigned to theological classes. The fact is, there ARE certain guidelines that govern science. Its called the scientific method. I'm pretty sure everyone is familiar with it so I won't bother repeating it here. The fact is that creationism/intelligent design cannot be proven or disproven. It makes use of experiments and evidence only when the results support its view and when they don't, simply ignores them with the statement \"Well, the Bible says so so end of argument\". That is the belief in something you cannot test and are only taking by faith. Even if it turns out to be correct, that is theology. A theory MUST be open to testing to count as science. If it happens to be a completely hair-brained and wrong theory (i.e. eugenetics) it can therefore be disproven and assigned to the dustbin of history.",
