   "Some things get big press, and some things don't. \n \n \n< This could be a scandal of epic proportions and one that makes Nixon's\n < Watergate or Clinton 's Monica Lewinsky affair pale by comparison. Why\n < was there neither rhyme nor reason as to which dealerships of the\n < Chrysler Corporation were to be closed? Roll the clock back to the\n < weeks just before Chrysler declared bankruptcy. Chrysler, like GM, was\n < in dire financial straights and federal government \"graciously\"\n < offered to \"buy the company\" and keep them out of bankruptcy and \"save\n < jobs.\" Chrysler was, in the words of Obama and his administration,\n < \"Too big to fail,\" same story with GM.\n < \n < The feds organized their \"Automotive Task Force\" to fix Chrysler and\n < GM. Obama, in an act that is 100% unconstitutional, appointed a guy\n < named Steve Rattner to be the White House's official Car Czar-\n < literally - that's what his title=2 0is. Rattner is the liaison between\n < Obama, Chrysler, and GM.\n < \n < Initially, the national media reported that Chrysler had made this\n < list of dealerships. That is not true. The Washington Examiner,\n < Newsmax, Fox New and a host of other news agencies discovered that the\n < list of dealerships was put together by the \"Automotive Task Force\"\n < headed by no one other then Mr. Steve Rattner.\n < \n < \n < Now the plot thickens. Remember earlier we said that there was neither\n < rhyme nor reason why certain dealerships were closed? Actually there's\n < a very interesting pattern as to who was closed down. Again, on May\n < 27, 2009, The Washington Examiner and Newsmax exposed the connection.\n < Amazingly, of the 789 dealerships closed by the federal government,\n < 788 had donated money, exclusively to Republican political causes,\n < while contributing nothing to Democratic political causes. The only\n < \"Democratic\" dealership on the list was found to have donated $7,700\n < to Hillary's campaign, and a bit over $2,000 to John Edwards. This\n < same dealership, reportedly, also gave $200.00 to Obama's campaign.\n < Does that seem a little odd to you?\n < \n < Steve Rattner is the guy who put the list together. Well he happens to\n < be married to a Maureen White. Maureen happens to be the former\n < national finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee. As\n < such, she has access to20campaign donation records from everyone in the\n < nation, Republican or Democrat. But of course, this is just a wacky\n < \"coincidence,\" we're certain.\n < \n < Then comes another really wacky \"coincidence.\" On that list of\n < dealerships being closed down, a weird thing happed in Arkansas ,\n < North Louisiana, and Southern Missouri . It seems that Bill Clinton's\n < former White House Chief of Staff, Mack McClarty, owns a chain of\n < dealership in that region, partnered with a fellow by the name of\n < Robert Johnson. Johnson happens to be founder of Black Entertainment\n < Television and was a huge Obama supporter and financier. These guys\n < own a half dozen Chrysler stores under the company title of\n < RLJ-McClarty-Landers. Interestingly, none of their dealerships were\n < ordered closed - not one- while all of their competing Chrysler/Dodge\n < and Jeep dealership were! Eight dealerships located near the\n < dealerships owned by McClarty and Johnson were ordered shut down. Thus\n < by pure luck, these two major Obama supporters now have virtual\n < monopoly on Chrysler sales in their zone. Isn't that amazing? Go look\n < in The Washington Examiner, the story's there, and it's in a dozen or\n < so other web-based news organizations; this isn't being made up.\n < \n < Now if you thought Chrysler was owned by Fiat, you are mistaken. Under\n < the federal court ruling, 65% of Chrysler is now owned by the federal< br< < government and the United Auto Worker's union- Fiat owns 20%. The\n < other 15% is still privately owned and presumably will be traded on\n < the stock market. Obama smiles and says he doesn't want to run the\n < auto industry.\n < \n < As horrifying as this is to comprehend, and being as how this used to\n < be the United States of America , it would appear that the president\n < has the power to destroy private businesses and eliminate upwards of\n < 100,000 jobs just because they don't agree with his political agenda.\n < This is Nazi Germany stuff, and it's happening right here, right now,\n < in our back yard. There are voices in Washington demanding an\n < explanation, but the \"Automotive Task Force\" has released no\n < information to the public or to any of the senators demanding answers\n < for what has been done.\n < Keep your ear to the ground for more on this story. If you've ever\n < wanted to make a difference about anything in your life, get on the\n < phone to your national senator or representative in the House and\n < demand an investigation into this.\n < \n < Benjamin Franklin had it right when he said, \"All that's necessary for\n < evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\"\n < \n < Car Czar No More\n < An amazing thing happed as this story was going to press. Obama's Car\n < Czar, Steve Rattner, resigned on July 13 and was promptly replaced by\n 0A< former steel workers union boss Ron Bloom. According to CBS News,\n < Rattner left \"to return to private life and spend time with his\n < family.\" Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said, \"I hope that he takes\n < another opportunity to bring his unique skills to government service\n < in the future.\" By the way, Rattner is under investigation for a\n < multi-million dollar pay-to-play investment bank scandal in New York .\n < Uh-oh! But, we're certain that had nothing to do with his resignation.\n < And, according to several news sources out there, there are rumors\n < he's being investigated for what could be pay-to-play scandal\n < involving the closing of Chrysler and GM dealerships. Really? Again,\n < that couldn't have anything to with his resignation- that's\n < ridiculous! Like CBS said, this guy just wants to \"spend more quality\n < time with his family.\"\n < Obama has 32 personally appointed \"czars\" who answer to no one but\n < him, all of whom are acting without any Constitutional authority. But\n < hey, we're sure they all have \"unique skills,\" as Tim Geithner likes\n < to say! \n",

   "The corruption which this administration represents is palpable marc, I remember hearing about the fact that republicans were targeted by the whitehouse when these closings took place. But the State controlled media never reported on it since they work for this administration, not the people they were created to serve in a free society so long ago. \n \n How about we make this thread about leftist plots of blatant corruption intended to undermine the American way? Let me know if you feel this contribution is hijacking your thread and I'll remove it and start its own thread, ok? But here is the latest solid and undeniable hidden camera evidence of Acorn actually advising a perceived prostitute on how to avoid paying taxes, import underage and illegal prostitutes from Guatemala, avoid paying taxes on them as they help her get into a home she will use as a brothel. All on hidden camera. http://biggovernment.com/2009/09/10/mediaite-could-andrew-breitbart-become-the-right's-arianna-huffington/",
