   "The wave of rapes by Muslims overflowing Europe presently. In Sweden, Norway, Germany and other EU countries local white females have suffered from rapes by Muslim countries immigrants. Moreover arrested suspects demand to judge them by Sharia law! As well-known the rape of woman not wrapped in clothes duly makes it possible for a rapist to escape punishment!\n Well, it looks so that 10 millions of Muslims in Europe are demanding form 500 million Europeans to put on yashmak and hijab to keep themselves safe from any possible raping! \n I think that Muslims are using open violence in hope to force Europeans live by Muslims laws! Maybe they will try to create Islamic Caliphate in Europe! That's why i think that EU needs to improve the methods of assimilating Muslims in Europe, possibly by using of economic means of pressure!",

It is a factor of false beliefs about how men should behave towards women. These false beliefs will be eradicated.\n\n I agree that this is an issue that cannot be automatically discounted as anti-Muslim. There has indeed been an increase in incidents of rape in various Scanidinavian countries recently. Furthermore, the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet apprently reported that 65% of rapes of Norwegian women were performed by \"non-Western\" immigrants-a category that, in Norway, consists mostly of Muslims. (I can try to take the time to dig up a link if you need it). \n \n One thing that most Americans don't realize is that the Muslim community here in the US is far more moderate than that in most European countries. Apart from some differences in demographics of the source of Muslim migration, a large part of the difference lies in how they are treated in their respective countries. Here, in the US, Muslims are generally well integrated and there is no significant difference in average standard of living between Muslims and non-Muslims. The fact that we are a nation of immigrants helps in this assimilation. In many European countries, on the other hand, the Muslim communities (which also generally constitute a much larger percentage of the population) are generally marginalized both socially and economically. Such marginalization can breed resentment and keep populations more isolated and less likely to assimilate, as they generally have in the US. That is a situation ripe for such fundamentalist Muslim sects to flourish since they sattisfy many of the angry reactions that these marginalized communities have against the West. This, in turn, further isolates these communities from their native populations - a vicious cycle.\n \n So, whoever you consider is at fault (the Muslims or the native communities), the reality is that the Islamic communities in Europe are typically far more extremist than in the US and very restrictive attitudes about women's rights and gay rights prevail. I am not at all surprised that this would be reflected in statistics of violence against women.\n \n Note: Some of these issues are addressed in the following blog which, though it sometimes leads to over-generalizing the Muslim community, does bring up many good points:\n http://www.bu.edu/partisanreview/archive/2002/3/bawer.html",

Yes, in the Bible, there are messages of loving ones enemies and doing good to those that hate you. There are also many messages about smiting ones enemies. Those of a violent mindset can easily find many Biblical quotes to justify their actions. The same, I imagine, is true for Islam and the Koran. One cannot just look at the best, moderate version of Islam and say THAT is the correct version. There is just too much room for interpretation, where the extremists are happy to choose those sections of text that support their position. In other words, Islam is not blameless in the violence shown by the extremists - both against \"infidels\" and against women and gays.",

   "Any religious extremist can be selective in their interpretation of their chosen superstition, but only Islam must be held accountable. Is that your interpretation?\n\n Mainstream religions of any sort (from Christianity to Islam to Hinduism, etc.) cannot simply ignore their extreme versions that exploit inconsistencies in their religious text. If any religion wants to claim that their religious texts are flawless, then they remain open to extremists using the inconsistencies to justify their skewed points of view. For example, if one wants to claim that the Bible has no flaws, then one has to properly explain all of the statements in the Bible about decimating ones enemies, stoning adulterers, statements defining how to treat slaves, etc. - most of which happen in the Old Testament. If they think that God inspired men to write all segments of the Bible, then that includes the Old Testament - one cannot just wave it away as irrelevant. \n \n Religious people need to acknowledge that their religious texts are imperfect and they need to have the courage to argue against the extreme versions of their religions. As long as they are either staying silent about the extreme versions, or claiming perfection in their religious texts while conveniently ignoring the controversial passages, then they are also to blame for the actions of the extremists. I think that the hardest part for most religions is to acknowledge the imperfection or inconsistencies in their religious texts. As for denouncing the extreme versions, that is easier for Christians to do since the extreme versions of the religion (often called cults) are not nearly as well organized or ruthless as the extreme versions of Islam. I can understand how Islamic moderates can be intimidated into silence, but, as long as the West does not hear a strong moderate Islamic voice renouncing the extremists, then many will continue equating Islam with its extreme version.",

   "Yes it is a good link...and the best part of it is in the last three paragraphs...a message to the world.\n \n \"This adaptation should be encouraged in every way possible. Muslim immigrants should not only be taught the language of their adopted country; they should be comprehensively educated in the ways of democracy. They must learn-no small order-to think for themselves, to read critically, to question. Most important, they must learn to question those things they have been taught to regard as most sacred. And they must be encouraged to see themselves as free individuals in a free land rather than as members of a straitjacketing subculture whose religion obliges them to take their marching orders from autocratic community leaders.\n \n Finally, these immigrants must be thought of-and must be encouraged to think of themselves-as full and equal members of the societies in which they live. European natives must appreciate what an accomplishment it is for people to become functioning members of societies radically different from the ones in which they were born. Those who do make the adjustment successfully deserve the utmost respect. To persist in calling them immigrants after they have been living and working in a country for years (and, even more outrageously, to use the same word to describe their European-born children and grandchildren) is not only offensive and insulting but staggeringly counterproductive. \n \n As for those who, after a period in the West, make it obvious that they are unwilling or unable to adapt, they must be sent home and replaced by deserving individuals who can adapt. This may appear extreme, but there is no reasonable alternative. For at stake in all this, ultimately, are the basic freedoms of all Westerners-not only women and homosexuals, but everyone, including Muslims and former Muslims who wish to live in a place where they can be themselves.

I can imagine that it would be quite difficult to teach them \"to question those things they have been taught to regard as most sacred\" without being accused of purposely trying to subvert the religion itself. \n \n The same delicate balance seems to be played out in issues where Christianity and Science clash. For example, when Evolution is taught, I don't believe that it is bluntly stated in these classes that the religious view of Creation is wrong. It simply presents its evidence and asks people to judge for themselves. Such a subtler approach might not work with strongly devout fundamentalist Muslims, as it does not work with strongly devout Evangelical Christians. \n \n So, if a blunter method needs to be used, then how does one go about doing that while maintaining that one has a stance of freedom of religion? If one picks and chooses various points in the religion against which to argue, then how does one decide on those points and does one use the same criteria for criticizing similar points in all religions - including Christianity?

Where did all the rapes happen, and when?\n\n \n Here are some National stats for you to chew on Penfold, from various European Countries and Australia.\n Pan-European Arab Muslim Gang Rape Epidemic\n \n Swedish victim, Muslim gang rape\n Today's news from Germany buries the fact that the gang rapists of a 13 year-old were likely Arab Muslim immigrants:\n \n Shock in Berlin as Suspected Rapists Freed\n \n Nowhere is the news reported that this is part of a gang rape epidemic sweeping areas with high Arab Muslim immigration.\n \n As is the case with young Arab Muslims throughout the West, teenage girls are generally forbidden to go out, leaving separatist gangs of predatory Arab Muslim males with highly misogynist attitudes. Harassment of females has therefore exploded throughout the West, most shockingly demonstrated in the recent phenomenon of gang rape for sport. Listed below is the evidence.\n \n While these cases are primarily not related to the core group of committed Islamists within Arab Muslim immigrant populations, there is some \"trickle-down\" of attitudes so it is also worth noting the rape aspects of Jihad ideology as well: The Rape Jihad. \n \n Germany\n \n Shock in Berlin as Suspected Rapists Freed\n \n The youths, aged 13 to 15, allegedly attacked their victim as she walked home from school in the Charlottenburg district which is generally seen as safe area with low crime rates.\n \n While allegedly gang-raping the girl, the youths are reported to have filmed the sexual attack with a mobile phone camera. Media reports say the four later boasted about the rape to other school children and sent copies of the video to friends.\n \n Police who detained the four earlier this week have so far not found any film footage of the alleged rape. There is suspicion the video pictures may have been erased and mobile phones of the suspects are being analysed by experts in a bid to retrieve any pictures....\n \n Adding to the potential explosiveness of the alleged rape is the fact that the four suspects are all the children of immigrant families, while the victim is German. The normally well-informed Bild tabloid said the suspects were two German-Turks, a German Russian and a German-Angolan.\n \n Federal police statistics released on Monday show non-German youths under the age of 21 were twice as likely to be crime suspects last year than German nationals of the same age.\n \n Officers in charge of the case are convinced the four youths carried out the gang rape and DNA tests are being carried out on sperm traces found on the victim.\n \n Given the brutality of the attack, there has been anger over a decision by Berlin justice officials to order the youths be set free. The 13-year-old suspect is too young to be kept in detention under German law, but the other three could be held.\n \n Berlin justice Senator Karin Schubert insists, however, that even youths suspected of violent crimes can only be kept locked up if there is danger they will flee justice.\n \n France\n Racial Gangrape: Another Diversity Disaster\n ...in more cosmopolitan centers like Paris and Australia, the game is blossoming. It consists in the ritual gang rape of white women by non-white immigrants....The ritual is known as a ?tournante,? meaning ?Take your turn,? and it consists of a black male becoming ?friendly with? (seducing) a white female, preferably a teenager. Once they?ve become chums, the male lures the girl to a location where his buddies in the gang ?take their turns? with her. In the case on trial in Paris, it was no fewer than 14 buddies. Unlike many victims of such fun, this young lady lodged a complaint with the police. As a result, she was gangraped a second time?this time, allegedly, by the 11 who went on trial in April....\n \n The incident is not isolated. Police investigations of similar rapes were underway in three other French cities, and one French magistrate says the game has been going on since at least the 1980s. ?Their technique was to pick up a young girl?a white girl?and once she had become the girlfriend of one of the members, he would allow his mates to make use of her?\n France Takes on Plague of Sexual ?Rite? (scroll down to see)\n \n Kidnap Accomplice of Ilan Halimi Was Herself a Victim of \"Tournante\"\n \n In Nice, Gang Rape Video of a Female Student is Circulating Freely Among Muslim Immigrants\n \n Australia\n The Australian Sun-Herald reports that police data show that some 70 racially motivated rapes of young white girls, one as young as 13, by Middle Eastern immigrants have taken place in the last two years. ?Fifteen youths and men have so far been charged with more than 300 offenses relating to matters since mid-2000 alone. They are all of Middle Eastern extraction. None of those involved is presently before the courts....those in Australia don?t seem to be part of a gang initiation, but they are nonetheless clearly racially driven. ?Before being brutalized,? the Australian paper reports, ?other victims have reportedly been questioned about their Australian heritage or forced to endure taunts about their attackers? prowess.? But, like the rapes in France, those in Australia follow a similar pattern in which one non-white male becomes intimate with a white girl, whom he then delivers to his friends for sexual violation, beating and humiliation.\n See also: Racial Gang-Rape: The Sequel\n \n Sweden\n \n Immigrant Rape Wave in Sweden\n \n Swedish girls Jenny and Linda were on their way to a party on New Year's Eve when they were assaulted, raped and beaten half to death by four Somali immigrants. Sweden's largest newspaper has presented the perpetrators as \"two men from Sweden, one from Finland and one from Somalia\", a testimony as to how bad the informal censorship is in stories related to immigration in Sweden. Similar incidents are reported with shocking frequency, to the point where some observers fear that law and order is completely breaking down in the country. The number of rape charges in Sweden has tripled in just above twenty years. Rape cases involving children under the age of 15 are six - 6 - times as common today as they were a generation ago....\n \n According to a new study from the Crime Prevention Council, Br?, it is four times more likely that a known rapist is born abroad, compared to persons born in Sweden. Resident aliens from Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia dominate the group of rape suspects. According to these statistics, almost half of all perpetrators are immigrants....\n \n A group of Swedish teenage girls has designed a belt that requires two hands to remove and which they hope will deter would-be rapists. \"It's like a reverse chastity belt,\" one of the creators, 19-year-old Nadja Bj?rk, told AFP, meaning that the wearer is in control, instead of being controlled. Bj?rk and one of her partners now plan to start a business to mass produce the belts....\n \n In an online readers' poll from the newspaper Aftonbladet, 82% of the women expressed fear to go outside after dark. There are reports of rapes happening in broad daylight....\n \n \"It is not as wrong raping a Swedish girl as raping an Arab girl,\" says Hamid. \"The Swedish girl gets a lot of help afterwards, and she had probably ****** before, anyway. But the Arab girl will get problems with her family. For her, being raped is a source of shame. It is important that she retains her virginity until she marries.\" It was no coincidence that it was a Swedish girl that was gang raped in Rissne ? this becomes obvious from the discussion with Ali, Hamid, Abdallah and Richard. All four have disparaging views on Swedish girls, and think this attitude is common among young men with immigrant background. \"It is far too easy to get a Swedish whore?? girl, I mean;\" says Hamid, and laughs over his own choice of words. \"Many immigrant boys have Swedish girlfriends when they are teenagers. But when they get married, they get a proper woman from their own culture who has never been with a boy. That?s what I am going to do. I don?t have too much respect for Swedish girls. I guess you can say they get ****** to pieces.\"\n \n Muslim Rape Epidemic in Sweden and Norway\n \n ...doubling of the number of reported rapes by ambush in 2004, following what was already a decade of steadily increasing numbers of sexual crimes\n \n the number of reported rapes against children is on the rise. The figures have nearly doubled in the last ten years: 467 rapes against children under the age of 15 were reported in 2004 compared with 258 in 1995. Legal proceedings continue this week in a case involving a 13 year old girl from Motala who was said to have been subjected to a group rape by four men. (Note: These four men were Kurdish Muslims, who raped the girl for hours and even took photos of doing so).\n Amanda and Molin Raped by Immigrant Gang (Swedish)\n \n Norway\n Rape charges in the capital are spiraling upwards, 40 percent higher from 1999 to 2000 and up 13 percent so far this year. Police Inspector Gunnar Larsen of Oslo's Vice, Robbery and Violent crime division says the statistics are surprising - the rising number of rape cases and the link to ethnic background are both clear trends....While 65 percent of those charged with rape are classed as coming from a non-western background, this segment makes up only 14.3 percent of Oslo's population. Norwegian women were the victims in 80 percent of the cases, with 20 percent being women of foreign background.\n \n Denmark\n Alarmed at last week's police statistics, which revealed that in 68% of all rapes committed this year the perpetrator was from an ethnic minority, leading Muslim organisations have now formed an alliance to fight the ever-growing problem of young second and third-generation immigrants involved in rape cases against young Danish girls.\n See also: Copenhagen Mufti Declares Women who Refuse to Wear Headscarves are \"Asking for Rape\"\n Caveats: There are two technical imprecisions in this post that were blurred for readability. Australia is not European. Also, among Western immigrants, Arabs and Muslims are different, but highly overlapping, groups. The phenomenon is highest among those who are Arab and Muslim, and largely unknown among non-Muslim Arabs.\n ",

Muslims in many European countries (particularly in the Scandinavian countries) are much less assimilated than in the US, and many are drawn to the more militant and extremist aspects of Islam. It seems that both groups (native Scandinavians and the immigrant Muslims) are to blame for the limited assimilation. More efforts need to be made to assimilate immigrant Muslims into their respective Western countries, and efforts also need to be made on the side of the native populations to be less discriminating against Muslims and treat those that have assimilated as equal citizens - both socially and economically.",

Archangel - who was the one who posted that blog, or myself - who claimed that one cannot ignore statistics (where I did not use that blog as evidence) and who was the last person to post on that subject before your response? Since you are not quoting anyone, it is hard to tell.\n \n Anyway, I also noticed that site and did not use it myself as evidence for the same reasons you posted. However, there are some more independent sources that do show alarming trends in rape in Scandinavia - at least some of which are attributed to rising crime rates by immigrants. Unfortunately, Googling \"Muslim rape Sweden\" or \"immigrant rape Sweden\" gave almost no official sources - mainly blogs - so it seems hard to find any official statistics, positive or negative, on the subject to either confirm or deny the trends. \n \n Official Swedish statistics do reveal that the number of reported consummated rapes has tripled over the last two decades - from a report from Bra, the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention: http://www.bra.se/extra/faq/?module_instance=2&action=question_show&id=292&category_id=9 , section on trends. This is as official as one can get. However, it says nothing there about ethnic background.\n \n In Oslo, the capital of Norway, a police investigation into the ethnicity of rape suspects did reveal that the majority were of foreign heritage, which in Norway generally means Muslims: http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article190268.ece . \n \n Statistics from Denmark are similar: http://www.cphpost.dk/get/62173.html\n where in that articles it states: \"His theory is backed up by a 1998 Justice Ministry survey on crime, which found that immigrants were over-represented by an average of 46 per cent. In addition, the recent publication of a report from the Copenhagen police shows that 47.5 per cent of prisoners on remand for serious crimes such as murder, attempted murder and rape come from immigrant backgrounds.\" Also, \"'Those immigrants who do commit rape belong to a hardcore group who have been considerably marginalised and alienated and who are extremely criminally inclined already. These are people who don't care what happens to them as they feel things can't get any worse anyway. They simply use and abuse others as it suits them. But even if we compare this group with other Danish-born people in the same situation, i.e. with no job and no prospects, the immigrant group is still over-represented.'\"\n \n These are isolated police and government reports, but they do show some very disturbing trends - at least in the cities where poor and marginalized people would generally reside. The statistics in the countryside could be much different. Unfortunately, it is hard to find a wider range of statistics to prove things one way or the other. If Muslim immigrants are not overrepresented in rape statistics, then it would make every sense to explore and publish those statistics. However, if they are generally over-represented then it is frustrating but somewhat understandable that such statistics should be not be explored. On seeing such statistics, I would advocate trying to increase police action to curb the actions of the minority of extremists that commit such crimes. Unfortunately, I am sure that much of the Scandinavian populations would use it as another excuse for across-the-board racism against Muslims.",

   "No wonder some intelligent people seem to have stopped posting on 4forums.\n \n All this childish bickering about who's jackin' whom around, who flung dung and who's the best at sardonic wit is detrimental to the success of this site in advancing legitimate debate.\n \n I wish all you adolescent arseholes (and you should know who you are) each a severe case of carpal tunnel syndrome...so bad that surgery won't fix it.\n\n That seems to happen so often in threads. They might start off in reasonable debate, but then they nearly always degenerate into flames. I think it is due to people's desire to have the last word and to think that they \"won\" the arguement if they have the last word - no matter how ridiculous the arguement. So, a lone flaming post starts an arguement that grows and grows until it takes over the whole thread - a pity.\n \n I personally prefer to ignore flamers. For the most part, they are not worth the trouble of responding. I generally try to only respond to posters who do make at least some effort at actual debate. The most frustrating tend to be the occasional posters who mix flaming with actual points.\n \n By the way, do you know of a forum that is less prone to such degradation of threads into flames? A few years ago when I first joined, I found this to be such a forum, but it seems to have degraded.",

However, sometimes, one gets a flamer that makes reasonable points as well. Most of those tend to calm down in their responses to you when they see that you are not flaming back. Others, such as \"Spicy Girl\" will still occasionally make some flaming remark but have enough content that it is worth continuing the discussion. However, occasionally you get the impossible poster, such as \"___\" that make the occasional reasonable point but one has to wade through too much ridiculous childish flaming to make it worth it. I guess one has to judge on a case by case basis.\n \nYes. \n \n http//:www.lucianne.com\n \n It's bit on the conservative side and I think they have all the posters they want...but it never hurts to try. I'm not saying that you have to be conservative to post there, it's just that most of the regulars appear to be so.\n\n I took a look, but it is a bit too conservative for my tastes. My politics tend to run in the left-of-center moderate range - which means that I am wary of politics on either extreme. When I see one side (of either spectrum) being whitewashed and the other only criticized, I get suspicious. Reading a few articles with their posts gave me somewhat of that impression with the lucianne.com site, but I didn't do enough searching to get a full impression.\n \n Thanks anyway for suggesting it.",
