   "so anyway, in my short experience it seems like this to me.\n \n liberals thrive on beating their fist against a wall, and the conservatives are always behind the crumbling wall trying to shore it up. once the liberal gets through the wall then they go on to the next, and the walls never end\n \n so who can we trust, the liberals will always want to tear something down and nothing will ever remain stable. if given their way all the time they would have everyone eating tofu and wondering why their car has no power or cargo room\n \n and of course conservatives would revert everything to the 50s or before, pumping out pollutants like there is no tommorrow, reviving old traditions, like killing flag burners (ok, so i couldnt think of anything better)\n \n and of course now ive annoyed the entire board, wootage\n \n its really a good thing that the 2 groups have locked eachother up in the legislature, can you imagine the havok one group could cause if allowed to roam with no opposition",

He threw money at the problem and Hitler promised not to invade the rest of Europe. What happened? If it weren't for the fortitude of Winston Churchil and the good old USA, we'd all be speaking Deutsch now!! No party is perfect, only a fool would believe that, but the truth is, the only way to defeat evil is by facing it head on- not by appeasement. I'll take my chances with the conservative President Bush.\n \n STU\n\n \n \n *Claps* Clinton sucked. He GAVE CHINA, our biggest rival at the moment, missile technology that now let's them have the capability to launch nukes to the West Coast. And I live in Hawaii....Do I feel safe knowing that thanks to our ex-president I have a Nuclear armed communist nation 2,000 miles away with the capability to turn my state into a radioactive spot on the pacific? Heck no.\n \n \n The UN sucks nearly as bad as Clinton. The UN is the waste of a perfectly good building in New York. If it weren't for the US there wouldn't be a UN....and how does the UN thank us? By trusting our judgement? Noo, they have to side with the French and German ******* and tell us to stay out of Iraq. (And going back to that Libiya thing....there are Slave Traders in Libiya, and the UN gave them our spot on the Human Rights commity...are they bling? Or just stupid?)\n \n \n I admit there are a couple things Bush hasn't done that I would've wanted him to. But he has done one thing very well: He's done what he said he would do. Kerry flip-flops over every issue, Bush stays firm. I at least want a president that has moral convictions - if FDR hadn't, I'd be part of the Hitler Youth right about now.",

(And going back to that Libiya thing....there are Slave Traders in Libiya, and the UN gave them our spot on the Human Rights commity...are they bling? Or just stupid?)\n\n \n You are right, they sided witht he french and the germans. BEfore invading a soveirgn nation, they wanted actual proof that there was some kind of threat there. Instead,w e got powell up there to give a little \"this is what we think\" speech that didn;t convince them.\n \n Trust our judgement? Our judgement was wrong. We now know the same thing the weapons inspectors were saying before. THere are no WMD's in Iraq (and no, a few shells scavenged from disposalsites do not count). \n \n They didn't give our seat on the human rights commission to Libya. The cmmission is an elected body first of all, and second, the seats are divided up regionally. I don;t recall off the top of my head who LIbya replaced, but I believe we were replaced by Austria. It sucks when you have managed to get world opinion turned against you that badly.\n \n \n \nI admit there are a couple things Bush hasn't done that I would've wanted him to.

I at least want a president that has moral convictions - if FDR hadn't, I'd be part of the Hitler Youth right about now.\n\n \n I agree with you 100% on this one. I don;t like a lot of stuff that bush does, but he tells you what he is going to do, then he does it. There is not a bunch of empty promises on internal issues, and not a buynch of patheic sabre rattling when it comes to foreign affairs. If he says \"We are going to cut taxes\" you may as well figure right then how much it will be and spend it, because it is coming. IF he says \"we will invade\", there are troops locking and loading in the background.\n \n While he admittedly has not done a great job of keeping some of his campaign promises, I think that in the wake of 9/11 his priorities changed just a bit. I think this is understandable.",

Many of the worlds nations see us as a rogue nation that hs invaded a little country in the middle east. IT makes much of the world VERY uncomfortable that we can launch nukes at them\n 2. BEcasue, according to Blix, these are most likely weapons that were placed in a chemical dump BY UN INSPECTORS and counted as destroyed. For all intents and purposes, these weapons were already handed over by the Iraqis, and it is only though American negligence that they are back in circulation. Blix spent YEARS in IRaq studying their WMD's and WMD programs. I am willing to take him at his word as the foremost authority int he world on this toipic.\n 4. Libya was elected to the commission to counter AMerica. Several countries are more than a little concerned about American human rights policies, but over the years we have argely managed to keep coutries that we could not control off the commission. Libya has brought up our treatment of detainees at Gitmo (a major point ot much of the world) and human right violations in Sadi Arabia. There has been a real problem with this in Sadi in the past, but America has managed to keep it out of the commissions discussions. Now, it is out on the table. Libya has, in the past, had some real issues when it comes to human rights. A lot fo the recent stuff we are hearing is rumors that were started in response to the fact that the year we were kicked off the commission, they were elected to it. there have not been any serious uman rights abuses confirmed in Syria for several years.",

   "If it really comes down to it conservatives don't want to tell you how to live your life while liberals do. The idea of conservatism is to reduce the effect of government on your daily life which encourages people to do for themselves. Liberalism tries to increase the effect of government on your daily life which encourages people to depend on the government for everything. Now which one would you choose? They both have their advantages and disadvantages but at the end of the day you are free in a conservative society.\n\n \n Have you ever seen the Nolan Model? I think you are confusing conservatives with libertarians, and liberals with fascists. True conservatives do not care about economic control, but they want government to control what people think, say, and believe. Liberals, on the other hand, want to regulate the economy but they want more freedom with regards to ideas and actions. Only libertarians want less government, but in some cases true libertarians want more government when it comes to enforcing laws against force, fraud, or involuntary collectivism.",
