And victory to those who follow Allah. Finally said, if it is the same, like the old days, such as Abu Bakr and Othman and Ali and others. In these days, in our times, that it will be the greatest jihad in the history of Islam and the resistance of the wicked people. \n \n A plane crashing into a tall building was out of anyone's imagination. This was a great job. He was one of the pious men in the organization. He became a martyr. Allah bless his soul.\n \n The above quotes are from bin Laden himself and an unidentified Shayk he met with on video.\n \n And I just have to add this one in, it has less to do with why they hate us but more with who they are and what they believe. This one was made by the Sheik Fawzan Al-Fawzan:\n \n \"The fact that it happened at this particular time is a sign from Allah. It happened at Christmas, when fornicators and corrupt people from all over the world come to commit fornication and sexual perversion. That's when this tragedy took place, striking them all and destroyed everything. It turned the land into wasteland, where only the cries of the ravens are heard.

Our foreign policy looks to provide security and prosperity for us and our way of life, not some altruistic beautiful world for all. I understand this and actually agree, but to suggest we never meant to PO anybody so they should be nice to us is just nonsense. We didn't care what they thought or what our dealings meant to their way of life. We figured they couldn't do a damn thing about it. We were wrong. \n \nEither way, I don't see where the racist comes in. I still believe you underestimate the religious influence on anti-western sentiments. \n\n Racist, bigoted, snobbish, paternal, call it what you like. I think you overestimate the percentage of Muslims that won't be satisfied until all non-Muslims are dealt with.",

Their hatred of the US thus comes more from ideology than politics. The Palestinians, in my opinion, have an incredibly legitimate gripe with the Israelis. The Iranian government has been made up of radical Muslims for over 20 years now. They're motivated, at least in part, by religion. And Saudi Arabia is debateable because oficially, they're against terrorism, but their government is so corrupt that there's a little bit of everything.\n\n \n Wow, not only wrong but demonstrates a complete and utter ignorance of ME politics.
