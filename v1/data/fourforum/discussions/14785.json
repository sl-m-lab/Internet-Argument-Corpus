   "Those of you who feel compelled to spout out that registration is immediately unconstitutional because of some gut feeling they have are not invited to post in this thread.\n \n I have been thinking a lot about this lately, trying to figure out some way to argue that firearms registration would be unconstitutional. I have not had much luck. Congress would most likely present registration as a revenue (tax) measure, applying a transfer tax to firearms sales. While you cannot tax the exercise of a right, you can tax the transfer of physical property (so while a firearms owners tax would be unconstitutional, a firearms transfer tax would just be another sales tax).\n \n We already have a firearms tax on certain types of firearms....the NFA. While there is not much case law on registration of \"standard\" guns, there is a lot of case law on the NFA, some of it fairly recent. \n \n I think that US vs Rock Island is probably the most representative case for this discussion simply because they delve into not only the case law, but the facts surrounding the passage of the NFA's registration requirements.\n \n U.S. v. Rock Island Armory, Inc., 773 F.Supp. 117 (C.D.Ill. 1991)\n \n \nIn Sonzinsky v. United States, 86 F.2d 486 (7th Cir.1936), aff'd, 300 U.S. 506, 57 S.Ct. 554, 81 L.Ed. 772 (1937), the Court of Appeals considered the validity of the requirement that a dealer in firearms register with the collector and pay a special excise tax of $200 per year. The Court found the NFA to be constitutionally valid as under the taxing power of Congress in Article I, \u00a7 8 of the Constitution. Rejecting the argument that the NFA's real purpose was suppression of crime, the Court held:\n \n  The act ... evidences no announced purpose outside the constitutional authority. [It is] unusually free from regulative provisions, merely providing for a tax in varying amount upon different classifications of persons and requiring such persons to register....\n \n Id. at 490.\n \n\n \n \nThe Supreme Court found the National Firearms Act on its face to be a revenue measure and nothing more. The Court noted:\n \n  The case is not one where the statute contains regulatory provisions related to a purported tax in such a way as has enabled this Court to say in other cases that the latter is a penalty resorted to as a means of enforcing the regulations.... Nor is the subject of the tax described or treated as criminal by the taxing statute.... Here Section 2 contains no regulations other than the mere registration provisions, which are obviously supportable as in aid of a revenue purpose. On its face it is only a taxing measure....\n \n Id. at 513, 57 S.Ct. at 555.\n \n The Court upheld its validity precisely because the National Firearms Act was a revenue measure only and did not purport to exercise any general criminal power not delegated to Congress by the Constitution. Moreover, the Court refused to speculate into any reasons why Congress might have taxed certain firearms:\n \n  Inquiry into the hidden motives which may move Congress to exercise a power constitutionally conferred upon it is beyond the competency of the courts.... They will not undertake, by collateral inquiry as to the measure of the regulatory effect of a tax, to ascribe to Congress an attempt, under the guise of taxation, to exercise another power denied by the Federal Constitution....\n \n Here the annual tax of $200 is productive of some revenue. We are not free to speculate as to the motives which moved Congress to impose it, or as to the extent to which it may operate to restrict the activities taxed. As it is not attended by an offensive regulation, and since it operates as a tax, it is within the national taxing power.\n \n Id. at 513-14, 57 S.Ct. at 556.\n \n\n \n IMO the case law on this is pretty clear....there are no constitutional problems with rolling out a firearms registration masked as a transfer tax.",

Even worse, they will not cower in front of their masters, they will cower in front of the below average intelligence badge wearing bafoon that their masters send to keep them in line. They will speak with great passion about the misdeeds of the government, but when it comes time to actually hgold somebody accountable, toss a politician up against the wall and shoot them, or put crosshairs on the storm trooper...er....uh....cop carrying out the will of the \"government\", they will tell you that individual is just doing their job.

Kissing your wife and kids goodbye, secure in the knowledge that you may never see them again, but your death will have purpose and hopefully will allow for a better future for those children.\n \n Our government does not fear an armed citizenry.

There's no taxation on non-motorized transport like bike riding or walking from point A to point B. There's absolutely no fee in place for enjoying the fact that the police can't search your possessions without first obtaining a signed warrant obtained through probable cause.\n\n \n Couple of things. First, the commerce clause has nothing to do with it. The taxation scheme comes into play under congress power to tax under Article 1, Section 8:\n \n \nThe Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;\n\n \n We have had an excise tax on guns and ammunition since 1937. It is either 10 or 11% (handguns and rifles are taxed differently). \n \n The poll tax was never actually found to be unconstitutional, the 24th amendment ended them.\n \n There are likewise several examples of fees or taxes than have been found to be constitutional that are attached to rights. For example, they have found that charging fees to register to run for public office, which the courts have ruled is a fundamental right, are acceptable. The government can charge a \"modest\" fee for demonstration permits and fundraising permits.\n \n So far, the test the courts have developed have been 2 pronged. The first is whether or not the fee in question is high enough to create a substantial burden to the exercise of the right. A $10 fee to defray the cost of the county clerks office for your marriage license is not a substantial burden....a $1000 fee to register as a lobbyist is. \n \n The second test is related to what the money is used for. A $10 fee for a marriage license fee WAS ruled unconstitutional because the fee was to be put into a fund used to help victims of domestic violence. Essentially the courts have ruled that the government can charge a fee to defray their costs in implementing a constitutionally acceptable regulation program.\n \n The fact that congress has not opted to tax the things you list does not mean they do not have the power to do so. Also, most of the things on your list are actions that do not require the transfer of tangible property. That changes things enormously. There is not precedent in this country for a tax for scratching your nose. If you tried to argue that there was no precednet for taxing the transfer of tangible property, you would be laughed out of pretty much any venue.",

   "What about the case of Printz v United States? The case that touched upon the Necessary and Proper clause of the US Constitution?\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/414582-post54.html\n \n \nIn his most recent post in our debate over the Necessary and Proper Clause, Orin argues that Supreme Court precedent has resolved the issue of what counts as \"proper\" as well as what is \"necessary.\" That, however, simply is not so. None of the cases Orin cites say anything about the meaning of \"proper.\" They all focus on whether the measure in question was \"necessary\" or not.\n \n In the rare instances where the Court has given separate consideration to the meaning of \"proper,\" the Court has made clear that it is a separate and distinct issue from what is necessary, and that it is not subject to broad judicial deference. For example in Printz v. United States, the Court concluded that a federal law requiring state officials to perform background checks on gun purchasers was \"improper\" because it invaded state sovereignty even though it was clearly \"necessary\" for implementing the government's regulatory purposes (in the broad sense of \"useful\" or \"convenient\" adopted by the Court). As Justice Scalia's majority opinion in that case put it:\n What destroys the dissent's Necessary and Proper Clause argument . . .. is ... the Necessary and Proper Clause itself. When a \"La[w] . . . for carrying into Execution\" the Commerce Clause violates the principle of state sovereignty reflected in the various constitutional provisions we mentioned earlier.... proper for carrying into Execution the Commerce Clause,\" and is thus, in the words of The Federalist, \"merely [an] ac[t] of usurpation\" which \"deserve[s] to be treated as such.\" The Federalist No. 33\n The Court did not apply broad deference to the government's position and did not conflate necessity with propriety. Notice also that Scalia doesn't deny that the background check provision is \"necessary\" for implementing the goverment's Commerce Clause-based purposes. Unfortunately, neither Printz nor any other case gives us anything approaching a complete definition of what counts as \"Proper\" under the Clause. So I don't claim that the current precedent proves that the individual mandate is \"improper.\" But it is clear that propriety and necessity are two separate issues, and that the Court is not especially deferential to the government when it comes to the former.\n \n Orin also contends that the issue of what is \"proper\" was raised by the Respondents in Comstock. Unfortunately, Orin here conflates two separate questions: whether the statute serves a constitutionally permissible end and whether it uses \"proper\" means to do so. The Respondents did not argue that the relevant statute was an \"improper\" means to a constitutionally permissible end. Rather, the relevant section of their brief (pg. 37) claims that the statute did not promote a purpose that is within Congress' enumerated powers. The title of the section makes this clear: \"Police And Parens Patriae Powers Are Not Proper 'Ends' For Federal Government Regulation.\"\n \n The main point at issue in Comstock was whether a statute allowing the federal government to detain \"sexually dangerous\" federal prisoners after they had finished their sentences advanced an end that was connected to some enumerated power. That is a separate question from the issue of whether a statute that does promote a permissible end under current doctrine uses \"proper\" means to do so. The Respondents' brief unnecessarily confused matters by claiming that a statute that doesn't pursue a permissible end is not \"proper.\" In reality, whether it is \"proper\" is irrelevant because such a statute wouldn't pass muster anyway because it does not \"carry into execution\" one of the federal government's other enumerated powers, as the text of the Clause requires. I discuss this distinction at greater length in my article on Comstock, where I criticize the Court's expansive interpretation of legitimate ends, but also explain thatthat says nothing about the issue of the propriety of means.\n \n In any event, regardless of what the Respondents said, the Court nowhere defines \"proper\" in Comstock. Neither does it overrule Printz and other previous cases holding that propriety and necessity are distinct issues.\n \n At this point, I really have to focus on doing work on my (unrelated) article. I'm sure Orin, the commenters, and others will continue their discussion of the subject if so inclined. I also refer interested readers to Randy Barnett's excellent analyses here and here. In the latter article, Randy goes through the relevant precedent in much more detail than I can here. He is also, of course, one of the leading academic experts on the Clause.\n \n UPDATE: I should acknowledge that the Respondents' brief in Comstock does at one point suggest that the means used may be \"improper\" because they infringe on state prerogatives (35-36). I should have noted this in the main post, and I apologize for the oversight. However, the Court's opinion seems to ignore this argument. Alternatively, maybe the majority thought they had addressed this issue when they concluded that the statute \"accommodated\" state interests because it essentially allows states to opt out at will by choosing to take custody of the relevant prisoners themselves and then releasing them if they prefer. There is, of course, no such accommodation in the individual mandate.\n \n Be that as it may, what matters in Comstock (or any case) is not what the litigants say, but what the Court decides. And Comstock nowhere defines \"proper.\" Neither does it overrule previous precedents holding that \"necessary\" and \"proper\" are separate issues.\n\n \n Is there anything here that would be of benefit to us?",

   "  Gun registry cost soars to $2 billion \n The gun registry was originally supposed to cost less than $2 million. \n\n \n   Gun Registry Worse than Useless \n Breached by unknown hackers over 300 times, Grossly incomplete and severely flawed error-riddled registry \n \n Police have admitted it has been breached by unknown hackers over 300 times. CPIC (Canadian Police Information Center) has been admittedly breached some 1,400 times up to 1995.\n\n   The gun registry doesn't make us safer \n The key factor to consider when determining the fate of the federal long-gun registry is whether or not it prevents crime. That was its initial objective. That is how Jean Chretien's Liberal government justified the nearly $2-billion that has been spent on the project ...\n\n \n Here is what this fact caused the gun control group, Violence Policy Center, to say long before it was 2 billion dollars too.\n   What are the limitations of licensing and registration? \nLicensing systems are very expensive to administer. Canada's experience with its full licensing and registration system, begun in December 1998, is not encouraging. The government originally estimated that the cost of licensing Canada's three million gun owners and registering their seven million guns would be $185 million [Canadian] over five years including a one-time start-up cost of $85 million [Canadian]. But, by March 2000 the Canadian Firearms Centre admitted that the system had already cost Canadian taxpayers $327 million [Canadian] and was running up an annual bill nearly 10 times higher than the government's original forecast. The March announcement also revealed that although 270,000 valid licenses existed from the country's earlier gun control system, only 142,000 new licenses had been issued. Using these figures as a baseline for America's arsenal of 65 million handguns, the estimated cost of such a system here is staggering.\n \n Most importantly, licensing and registration in America would have little effect on the vast majority of gun violence, such as unintentional gunshot deaths, suicides and the majority of homicides, since most homicides are the result of arguments between people who know each other and who purchase guns legally.\n \n From a political perspective, a battle over licensing and registration brings every gun owner into the fray. The NRA argument that licensing and registration is the first step towards gun confiscation has always been very persuasive with gun owners. In contrast, health and safety regulation of the industry focuses on the conduct of firearm manufacturers.\n \n Advocates of licensing and registration often cite automobiles as an example of the value of licensing and registration: we register automobiles and license drivers, so why not guns? However, licensing and registration\u00ef\u00bf1/2the primary purpose of which was to enforce a system of taxation\u00ef\u00bf1/2had virtually no effect on automobile death and injury. It was not until the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration was established in the 1960s, and changes were forced in automobile design and the driving environment, that decreases were seen.\n",

   "I'm curious as to what exactly people are Concerned about when it comes to registering a gun. I have heard that \" It is an invasion of Privacy, as one argument among many. so what exactly is the problem people have with registration? Is it the Privacy thing? Is it the possible fees and/or taxes that might be imposed.\n\n \n See concerns about Canada's long gun registry. The system has been hacked repeatedly, meaning that whatever computer savvy criminals out there that could get access, can get your name, address, city of residence, and the number and types of firearms that're registered to you. That allows them to run advanced reconnaissance and plan potential break ins and heists.\n \n Would you really want your information made accessible by a criminal when you had no say in the matter? Compiling this information in a centralized and easy to find location is practically inviting trouble. And the number of cyber criminals is on the increase, so we know that attacks like this can only grow in number and frequency. So do we want to have the government practically handing out our private information to parties that don't have our best interests in mind?\n \n This breach of security would be comparable to you going out, meeting unsurly individuals on the street, telling them your name and address, disclosing how much money you have at home, and where you keep your jewelry.\n \n Seriously, think about it. \n \n \nAnd before anyone goes flying off the handle again I'm not saying I'm for gun registration I'm merely Curious as to what really is the big deal.\n\n \n Ask anybody that's emigrated to the United States from a country where guns were registered first and then confiscated later. They'll tell you. Germany, Africa, Japan, Britain, Scotland, England, Ireland, Canada, China, India, Israel, Jerusalem, Turkey, Pakistan, Australia, etc. The number of countries to choose from are many.",

   "One benefit of gun registration in Canada is continuous eligibility screening:\n \n \"Continuous-eligibility screening is one of the most innovative features of the CFP [Canadian Firearms Program]. Rather than just doing background checks at the time of licensing and renewal (as was done under previous legislation), the CFRS [Canadian Firearms Registration System] is dynamic and continuously updated as new information comes to the attention of the police and courts concerning the behaviour of licence holders. All current holders of firearms licences, POL (Possession Only) and PAL (Possession and Acquisition of further firearms), are recorded in the Canadian Firearms Information System (CFIS). CFIS automatically checks with the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) every day to determine whether a licence holder has been the subject of an incident report in CPIC. All matches generate a report entitled Firearms Interest Police (FIP) that is automatically forwarded to the CFO [Chief Firearms Officer] in the relevant province for follow-up. Some of these reports require no further action, but others may lead to review of the individual's licence and may result in its revocation. Continuous-eligibility screening reduces the likelihood that an individual who has shown they are a risk to public safety will be permitted to retain possession of firearms.\"\n http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/pubs/fire-feu-eval/eval-eng.pdf",

Surely you would readily submit to drug, alcohol and mental tests for everyone for the \"good of society\"? Just line up all those on the streets on any given day and administer the drug tests, DNA, facial scan and strip search ala TSA? If you don't pass, REVOKED. straight to the happy house sans retaining any I.D.\n \n I am all for trying that in kanada and England where this pdf originated. We will try your buddy, Lambert in Australia first and then you to get a start and draw conclusions which will likely result in a 100% 'compliance failure\" requiring a daily check by the CDIS police and report to the chief CDO (chief drug officer\" and retention of your alcohol license to drink or use any non prescription drug.\n \n Sounds good to me, \"let's git 'er done!\"",

He surveyed police across the country and was impressed with how many officers responded. Of the 2,631 officers who replied, a total of 2410 &#8211; or 92 per cent &#8211; said the registry is useless to them in the line of duty.\n \n Constable Kuntz said he didn&#8217;t believe the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police (CACP) persistent claim that the overwhelming majority of police support the registry. He believes the registry is a waste of time and money, and even worse, he fears it places police officers in harm&#8217;s way by providing inaccurate and useless information. \n",
