   "The gun registry doesn't make us safer\n \n \nThe key factor to consider when determining the fate of the federal long-gun registry is whether or not it prevents crime. That was its initial objective. That is how Jean Chretien's Liberal government justified the nearly $2-billion that has been spent on the project and a bureaucracy that continues to consume between $87-million (RCMP estimate) and $106-million (Canadian Taxpayers Federation estimate) annually.\n \n If the registry prevents murders and cuts down on other gun crimes such as robberies and armed drug deals, then there might be a case for keeping it -- might. Otherwise, there is no justification for the way it makes criminals of law-abiding gun owners.\n \n In fact, on the crime-prevention front, the registry has been an abject failure.\n \n A couple of weeks ago, RCMP Chief Superintendent Marty Cheliak was reassigned from head of the registry to French-language classes. A lot of pundits claimed Mr. Cheliak was being moved to keep him quiet in advance of next month's parliamentary showdown over the registry. They also insisted he should be listened to on the subject of the registry -- after all, he said the registry was effective and he should know because he had been in charge of the northern Alberta Mountie division when four officers were murdered in an ambush in 2005 by James Roszko at Mayerthorpe, Alta.\n \n But how does that experience prove the worth of the registry? All the databases and bureaucrats and tax dollars did nothing to stop Roszko from getting guns and turning them on Mounties, just as maintaining the registry will do nothing to prevent the next Roszko. No matter how much money and effort goes into a registry, bad guys get guns despite it.\n \n Just look at the stats for homicides committed with firearms. In 1991, one-third were committed with handguns, two-thirds with long guns -- i.e. rifles and shotguns. Today, we have pretty much the same murder rate as 20 years ago (it's off marginally because, as our population ages, it becomes less murderous), but now handguns are responsible for two-thirds of firearms murders, long guns just one-third.\n \n Why? Because as federal gun control measures have made long-guns harder to acquire, criminals have turned to handguns, which are still widely available on the black market. Criminals used to buy most of the weapons they use at hunting and hardware stores. When Ottawa made that difficult, law-abiding Canadians stopped buying long guns (sales are off roughly 75% in a quarter century), but criminals simply switched to guns smuggled in by other criminals.\n \n The registry may have had some impact in discouraging ordinary Canadians from taking up shooting sports, but it has done nothing to deter criminals.\n \n Consider: Since 1934, it has been the law in Canada to register handguns, and yet handguns are now the firearm of choice for murderers. If registration had the power to prevent crime, that simply could not happen.\n \n In a study on the effectiveness of the registry, released Tuesday, the RCMP argued that the registry has had a positive effect on suicides committed with guns. To which I say: So what? The key number we should be looking at is suicides, not suicides performed through this or that method.\n \n The overall number of suicides in Canada has not subsided since the advent of the registry. Each year, between 3,500 and 3,800 Canadians end their own lives. There are fewer now killing themselves with guns, true, but more doing so with rope, pills, gas and cars.\n \n Do the proponents of the registry truly believe their pet project has achieved some great public good just because it has convinced a few distraught Canadians to gas themselves with the motor running in a closed garage rather than sticking shotguns against the roofs of their mouths?\n \n Interesting, too, is a chart on page 23 of the new RCMP report that compares total U.S. homicides (all weapons and methods) with total Canadian homicides. Since 1991, the U.S. murder rate has fallen by over 40%, the Canadian rate by less than a third.\n \n Since both rates involve far more than just firearms-related homicides, it's impossible to say definitively whether gun control has had any impact. However, it is interesting that while we have been wasting years on the registry, the Americans, with no registry, have seen a much larger drop in murders.\n \n The registry is nothing more than an expensive symbol that lets liberals and urban-dwellers believe they are taking concrete action to stem firearms crime, when, in fact they are doing nothing of the sort.\n",

   "Hey Bryan. I'll answer the the second question first. Basically its a catch statement all for things like the college campus ban such as a ban in court rooms and things like that.

I work at various colleges often and they are mostly the same and no college needs to worry about gun policies when they have so much else to worry about. Would it make a college campus \"unsafe\" if they did allow it? Probably not anymore than it already is.\n\n \n Thank you Steeeeve. \n \n While we are still on the topic of location-based bans like a college campus, let me ask this further question:\n \n Would you favor or oppose having an exception to a college campus gun ban that allowed persons with CCW permits to carry while on campus?\n \n Now let me shift gears to something else you've mentioned...\n \n I note your opinion is that the \"main\" purpose of the 2nd. Amendment was to protect yourself \"not from others but from your government.\" SCOTUS has ruled in Heller that: \n \n The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.

Back before we fought the British the only way the colonists could have overtaken the redcoats was to be armed. This is why they found it to be so important. It is \"Self Defense\" against your government.\n\n \n Okay. I think I understand your response on Heller. Thanks for offering that. \n \n To come back to CCW permit holders and a college campus....I think we will have a slight disagreement here. I do not agree that a college campus environment is massively different from off-campus life in a way that is relevant or material to firearm possession. \n \n But look, it is not fair for me to sit back and ask all the questions without also stating my position. I believe CCW permit holders should be allowed to carry on a college campus, including students and faculty. For me the issue is one of trust as opposed to fear. Here is my reasoning: \n \n We trust them to make calculations which help NASA guide spacecraft to Mars. We trust them to enter and make use of nuclear reactor facilities. We trust them to handle and learn about deadly infectious diseases. We trust them to operate on people in teaching hospitals.\n \n I fail to see why we can't also trust them to carry concealed with a permit. \n \n The State that issues them a CCW permit already trusts them to carry concealed when they go grocery shopping at Food Lion and when they buy a cheeseburger at the local McDonalds. I believe that this trust has not been misplaced. I know some have made dire predictions about giving people permits to carry concealed. Many years ago my home state of Virginia relaxed its requirements for CCW permits and opponents cried out that there would be blood in the streets. A few years ago Florida relaxed its CCW permit requirements and the same crowd made similar predictions of dramatically increased bloodshed over fender benders, etc. I remember they even derisively said Florida should change its motto from the \"sun shine\" to the \"gun shine\" state. But the trust the states placed it their citizens did not have these dire results, and these false prophets of doom have since fallen silent. \n \n And so I see this as the real question: For those who already have a CCW permit, is there any evidence to suggest they suddenly decompensate and become untrustworthy the moment they set foot on campus, only to become rehabilitated and able to safely carry concealed again when they leave and go home to their off campus apartments or to the video store?\n \n I see nothing about the college campus environment which has this effect on a person. \n \n But as I said Steeeeve I think our disagreement over this issue is only slight. While I read your words to say you would not be an advocate for it, I do not read you to be excited enough about the issue to have a strong opposition to it. So let me reach out beyond you, Steeeeve. I want to reach out to all those who would be strongly opposed to allowing campus carry by CW permit holders.... \n \n Let's be honest, here. Isn't the real goal a complete ban on CCW permits-which is based on a belief that no one can be trusted at anytime, anywhere, for any reason to carry concealed? And isn't support for a campus ban based upon the logic that a partial, location based ban is better than having no ban at all? \n \n Or do you support concealed carry--just not on campus? Are you arguing that students/faculty/staff members, etc. can be trusted to carry concealed while shopping on aisle 7 for ice cream-but they cannot be trusted to carry concealed while being bored to tears in econ 101?",

I'm of the opinion that guns on a campus would neither increase or prevent any crime. It wouldn't have prevented a thing at Virginia Tech and allowing them wouldn't have made it more frequent.

Sorry to say by perception goes a long way even if not true. It should be treated no differently than a high school because it is basically the same idea.\n \n You know, it reminds me a lot of smoking bans on campus. Is it really helping anything?

   "How about courthouses, bars and sports stadiums?\n \n Still all good? \n \n Why not commercial airliners, The White House.\n \n C'mon, you can trust them there if you can trust them in the park.\n\n \n A fair set of questions, Sinjin. I guess I have not said before what I do or do not favor in these locations.\n \n Let me first say this. Private property rights trump the CCW permit. If (for example) a sports stadium is privately owned and the owners choose to ban firearms then you cannot carry even with a permit without trespassing. That's the law in my state, and I have no problem with this. If I own it, then I should be allowed to control the conditions for those who ask my permission to enter. And if I, as a gun owner, do not like a business telling me my gun is not welcome, then I can either go in without it or take my money somewhere else.\n \n Sports stadiums: The private property issue aside, Virginia allows CCW permit holders to carry concealed within sports stadiums that are not a part of an elementary, middle, or high school property. I have no problem with this.\n \n Schools: Virginia has allowed all persons who may otherwise lawfully have firearms to have unloaded rifles and shotguns in vehicle gun racks on school property for as long as I can remember. I have no problem with this. In 2005 Virginia amended its law banning other guns on school property to allow concealed carry within vehicles on school grounds for permit holders. We have not had reason to regret the trust we have given to CCW permit holders. I support this as well.\n \n Bars: Effective July 1, 2010, Virginia has amended its CCW permit law to allow permit holders to carry concealed within bars and other locations that serve alcohol so long as the person does not consume alcohol while armed. I have no problem with this.\n \n Airliners: No, I do not support concealed carry on airlines. I once flew to a training (this was before 9/11) and when I checked in the clerk asked me if I wanted to carry my gun on the plane with me or check it with my bags (I was mistaken for a police officer). I can't imagine that question being asked now. But then again I also used to take pocket knives on planes. I am a realist, and I know the unique threat terrorism makes to air travel. For that reason I accepted (but did not like) having to undergo a full body scan when I flew out and back into the country this summer-an unimaginable invasion of my privacy just ten years ago. The difference between air travel and a college campus in my mind is we have a very real, numerous, and active enemy determined to assault air travel. But while we are on this subject let me also say this....I have always supported the idea of making terrorists bring knives to a gun fight if they want to hijack a plane again. For this reason I supported allowing pilots to carry. Where have all the false prophets gone who said arming pilots would cause a rash of shootings just because they have had a bad day? \n \n White House: For the same reason I have no problem with a gun ban at the president's residence. \n \n Courthouses: I do not favor concealed carry in courthouses. I believe there are unique security concerns involved that you do not find on a college campus (or anywhere else). Let me offer an example that did not involve the courthouse but did involve a defendant. In 2003 I prosecuted a man for a double murder of an elderly couple in which the weapon used was a claw hammer. He was caught quickly and he confessed but the hammer was not found. He was held without bond and was looking at the possibility of the death penalty. In any event on the day he was arrested he had likely seen his very last day as a free man. A few days after his confession he offered to show us where he had thrown the hammer (he described it as a being in a very remote field within a mile of the murder scene). Several officers wanted to take him out right away and let him show them where the hammer was. But before this was done one officer said \"Wait a minute. I think before we do this we need to pull the tapes of his jail phone calls to make sure he is not setting us up. The last thing we want to do is drive him out into the middle of nowhere to look for a hammer and instead find a bunch of his friends carrying shotguns.\" It turned out that no such plan of escape existed, but the thought illustrates the unique security concerns involved with courthouses. Every day men and women are shuffled off to serve 10, 20, 50 years, life imprisonment, and some are even ordered to die. In general they meekly shuffle off towards their fate just because a man who wears a black robe whom they have never met says, in effect: \"so let it be written, so let it be done.\" But not all men go quietly, and more than a few are desperate enough to attempt escape. When a man is sentenced to life imprisonment, and he starts fighting the bailiff's attempts to put him back in the holding cell, and his mother is falling out crying and yelling in the courtroom, this is not the time to discover that his five brothers have come to court carrying concealed. So no, I do not favor concealed carry in courthouses because of the unique security risk posed by men who are not prepared to accept that their crimes have given a man in a black robe total power to take away their freedom and/or his life. The circumstances are radically different from a college campus. Algebra class may drag on and seem like an eternity, but I do not see the same threat of someone texting his friends and asking them to bring their guns and spring him from class for the rest of the day. \n \n So that is where I stand on what I again say is the not absolute RKBA. \n \n Agree or disagree as you will.",

This so-called \"law and order\" group has had an inordinately large number of member-mayors that have been felony indicted or convicted including Sheila Dixon, Kwame Kilpatrick, Gary Becker, Larry Langford, Samuel Rivera, Jerramiah Healy, the late Frank Melton, Will Wynn, and David Della Donna.) Perez faces up to 60 years in prison after conviction on five corruption charges.\n \n These abuses of taxpayer properties are not private property owned by government any more than a football or basketball franchise cutting a deal with kickbacks and bond floating issues to make the taxpayer and fan pay treble for what is his to begin with.

A Judge or ex officio member of the court also enjoys carrying their guns to court, a court built, financed and maintained rather generously by the taxpayer and given a license to rob all they can from common criminals or even accused criminals. Very few people accused of a crime belong in the court room anyway and the justice system which is criminal in nature charges high fees to cut a deal to end the hassel.

They also pass laws not in their power to rob you of your money and rights. If the tramps want 51% of the vote they take the position that the law means very little if it concerns them or their buddies. So, whose right is more important?

   " Yeah, I don't buy into the whole bloodshed over fender benders argument but at the same time that is not my argument for no guns on college campuses. I'm of the opinion that guns on a campus would neither increase or prevent any crime. It wouldn't have prevented a thing at Virginia Tech and allowing them wouldn't have made it more frequent. A crazy person will do damage no matter what. What it comes down to is the same thing it comes down to in a court room or high school which is the environment in which you are in.\n \n You know, it reminds me a lot of smoking bans on campus. Is it really helping anything? No. It just looks better. \n\n \n I agree, particularly with the last statement. My answer is that if it truly has no positive or negative effect on crime, if it does not make another shooting more or less likely, then all things being equal I believe the government&#8217;s default position should not be to restrict the individual liberty interest because a politician thinks it looks better. \n \n I have heard it said that Washington is full of solutions that are in search of problems. Special interests lobbyists are always touting a new product, or a new service, which their client can provide and which Congress should buy or fund&#8212;and they are always on the lookout for some perceived crisis to use as justification for the expenditure. It is a backwards way of doing government, and I do not believe the same process should be applied to gun regulation. \n \n The RKBA is mine, it is not the government&#8217;s right. The government should not be allowed to create a restriction of the right and then go out in search of a justification afterwards when challenged. It should bear the heavy burden of proving the justification exists before it moves to restrict the right&#8212;and I think the justification needs to be far more than cosmetic. And only if it shows the justification exists should it then be allowed to argue how the restriction is not an unconstitutional infringement of the right. \n \n \n Here's something to throw a monkey wrench into the private property issue, Bryan. You firearm is private property, bought with your own money, it's yours and that's the long and short of it. It's no different than your cellphone, MP3 player, favorite metal band shirt, religious symbol necklace, or maybe even a pocket version of the bible.\n \n Private property rights are important. But just whose private property rights should be allowed to win out over the other? Should a store have the authority to tell you that your private property rights don't apply because you're on their private property, and thus anything in their zone is at their sole discretion? \n\n \n The law in Virginia answers that question with a yes. When these two property rights clash the landowner wins. The general principle is that every person has a right to enjoy his land, his building, or his house free from unwanted intrusion&#8212;and if a landowner wants to place conditions on the entry into his property then he can do so. He can restrict my entry to certain times of the day, to a condition of being sober, to not disrupting an event he is sponsoring, and on being unarmed if he wants to. It is the same legal principle that when combined with the law of self-defense gives rise to the castle doctrine&#8212;which says a man has a right to live in his home free from unwanted intrusion and that to protect this right he may use deadly force to repel a violent intruder. My personal opinion is I&#8217;m OK with it. The flip side is a businessman has no right to my business, and if I don&#8217;t like his gun free policy then I can take my business elsewhere.\n \n I also forgot to mention in my last post that Virginia requires sobriety for carrying concealed in public--no matter who the person is. In Virginia it is a crime to carry concealed in public while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. And I have no problem with this either. In my opinion the RKBA is not free of responsibility, and I believe that if you want to carry a gun then it should also be your responsibility to do so soberly. \n \n \n Sorry Bryan, you are issued a gun and badge and almost complete immunity forever so you have nothing to lose as opposed to a CHL holder.

See ante, at 22- \n \n In my view, the record makes plain that the Framers of the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the ratifying-era public understood-just as the Framers of the Second Amendment did-that the right to keep and bear arms was essential to the preservation of liberty. The record makes equally plain that they deemed this right necessary to include in the minimum baseline of federal rights that the Privileges or Immunities Clause established in the wake of the War over slavery. There is nothing about Cruikshank's contrary holding that warrants its retention. \n * * \n I agree with the Court that the Second Amendment is fully applicable to the States. I do so because the right to keep and bear arms is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment as a privilege of American citizenship.\n\n\n Or do I need an interpreter to interpret this in a way not readily recognized?",

   "Bryan:\n Just a rhetorical question here.If you go into someones business and they have\n posted on the door NO FIREARMS PERMITTED and your carrying concealed\n (legally)your saying you broke their law or rules of entry, so unless your weapon\n sets off a detector (my keys have)they will have no way of knowing.\n Here's the rhetorical part:A gunman enters opens up,you pull your weapon and\n carefully return fire and stop the gunman.Now what?well done,jail,fined,or all,\n or would the store owner change policy;just in general as things and people vary.\n\n \n In Virginia the \"NO FIREARMS PERMITTED\" sign acts as a \"NO TRESPASSING\" sign for those carrying even with a CCW permit. Most people aren't afraid of guns where I live, and so I see these signs rarely. Personally, when I see them I say \"screw them\" and I spend my money elsewhere. In my experience trespassing laws are never enforced without the request of the landowner. That is, the landowner must say \"I want him charged\" before law enforcement will take action. Whether or not a store owner would want the \"hero\" charged or not is up to him. However, if it happened in my jurisdiction then the total power to choose whether to prosecute the case would belong to me-and I could choose to refuse to prosecute the case and dismiss it. I would not prosecute the trespass, and I don't know a single law enforcement officer where I live that would ask me to-but, as I said, where I am we don't fear CCW permit holders. Of course, other prosecutors could view the same situation differently and choose to prosecute....\n \n On the topic of prosecutors and their proper role in society, I'll repost something I have offered before: \n \n The Supreme Court of Virginia has been clear that Commonwealth's attorneys prosecuting violations of the law enjoy discretion in the selection of cases for prosecution.2 As the Court has noted a prosecutor's \"duty to administer the criminal law impartially, in the interest of justice, is essentially a judicial one.\"3 \"A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice, and not simply that of an advocate.\"4 Such responsibility obligates him to see that the party charged with an offense \"is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of sufficient evidence.\"5 The prosecuting attorney, therefore, has the authority and the responsibility not only to ensure that the criminal process is not abused,6 but also to ensure that criminal prosecutions are pursued only to seek justice.7 Consequently, the Commonwealth's attorney should use restraint in the discretionary exercise of governmental powers, such as in the selection of cases to prosecute. Opinion of the Attorney General 2001 Va. AG 42, 42, 01-078, ___ (2001)\n \n \"There is a most important reason why the prosecutor should have, as nearly as possible, a detached and impartial view of all groups in his community. Law enforcement is not automatic. It isn't blind. One of the greatest difficulties of the position of prosecutor is that he must pick his cases, because no prosecutor can even investigate all of the cases in which he receives complaints. If the Department of Justice were to make even a pretense of reaching every probable violation of federal law, ten times its present staff will be inadequate. We know that no local police force can strictly enforce the traffic laws, or it would arrest half the driving population on [Page 728] any given morning. What every prosecutor is practically required to do is to select the cases for prosecution and to select those in which the offense is the most flagrant, the public harm the greatest, and the proof the most certain.\n \n \"If the prosecutor is obliged to choose his case, it follows that he can choose his defendants. Therein is the most dangerous power of the prosecutor: that he will pick people that he thinks he should get, rather than cases that need to be prosecuted. With the law books filled with a great assortment of crimes, a prosecutor stands a fair chance of finding at least a technical violation of some act on the part of almost anyone. In such a case, it is not a question of discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for the man who has committed it, it is a question of picking the man and then searching the law books, or putting investigators to work, to pin some offense on him. It is in this realm - in which the prosecutor picks some person whom he dislikes or desires to embarrass, or selects some group of unpopular persons and then looks for an offense, that the greatest danger of abuse of prosecuting power lies. It is here that law enforcement becomes personal, and the real crime becomes that of being unpopular with the predominant or governing group, being attached to the wrong political views, or being personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor himself.\" Robert H.

   "The right to bear arms comes from God and Nature? No.\n\n \n The first 8 amendments called the BOR belong to the people. There is no grant of power by Congress to infringe these rights. \n \n Notice of this was made in Cochrum vs. State. The ruling follows:\n \nThe above definitions were far broader than the terms normally signify, and would include sheath knives such as those used for hunting and fishing.83 The clear legislative intent was to discourage unlawful stabbings with large knives. \n The enactment was challenged in Cockrum v. State as violative of the arms guarantees in the federal second amendment and Section 13 of the Texas Bill of Rights.84 In an opinion by Justice \n \n Oran M. Roberts, the Supreme Court defined the purpose of the two constitutional provisions as \n follows: \n \n The object of the clause first cited, has reference to the perpetuation of free government, and is based on the idea, that the people cannot be effectually oppressed and enslaved, who are not first disarmed. The clause cited in our bill of rights, has the same broad object in relation to the government, and in addition thereto, secures a personal right to the citizen. The right of a citizen to bear arms, in the lawful defense of himself or the state, is absolute. He does not derive it from the state government, but directly (pg.647) from the sovereign convention of the people that framed the state government. It is one of the \"high powers\" delegated directly to the citizen, and \"is excepted out of the general powers of government.\" A law cannot be passed to infringe upon or impair it, because it is above the law, and independent of the law-making power.85 \n\n \n You just got Heller & McDonald that declares the right to be an individual right of each citizen.

Co-operative lawyers are a great help and the accused usually doesn't even know he is getting screwed. \n\n \n Doc, if you don't even know who runs the jails and prisons in my state, then how can you assume the returns are fantastic? In Virginia the localities run the jails, either singly or by operating jointly under regional jail authorities, and the state runs the prisons. They all spend far more money housing inmates than they make. In Virginia there are no private prisons that make money on each inmate they house. The only inmates Virginia makes any money on are ones we house on contract from Pennsylvania-which pays Virginia more than our cost to house them because it can't find room for them back home. The cost to the taxpayer of the entire system is far greater than the system makes in return on fines and costs. But maybe your conspiracy theory involves vast sums of money going into the pockets of individual players in the system? I don't know. All I know is I'm not getting any of it, and where the money goes or how much of it goes is not something that I base my decisions upon. I'm not my brother's keeper, and I'm not going to try and stop you from hating on the system. I'm just saying don't hate on me without facts that apply to me. \n \n \n The RIGHT has always been ABSOLUTE and always will be as long as freemen are willing to fight and defend those rights. \n\n \n Doc, what do you mean when you say absolute? \n \n \nBryan. \n What would have happened to all of the Gun Laws in America if the five Justices would have incorporated under Privileges and Immunities like Thomas did? \n At the Very Best anti-gun hope, I read it like, if one law falls in California, ALL similar laws go everywhere. Period! Or, all laws greater then the Federal Government go, just like preemption works on the state level. \n I also see Shall Not Infringe as the Standard with either P&I or Due Process! So what would have been the difference for the 2nd if it went P&I?\n\n \n The whole P&I argument was about more than the RKBA. It was an attempt to have the Court use the 14th. Amendment to \"cut and paste\" against the states every portion of each of the first 8 amendments in the BoR. IMO, that was the goal of the creators of the 14th.\n \n But if SCOTUS had done this there would not be much difference than what we have now as far as the RKBA goes. SCOTUS has declared the RKBA \"fundamental\" and incorporated it. In that sense we got the best we could hope for in McDonald. The RKBA is no longer the red-headed step-child of the BoR. It is now declared to be as equally important as, for example, free speech or freedom of religion. As it stands now, any law declared unconstitutional in one state means a similar law cannot stand (or be passed) in another state. So, no state can enact or uphold a D.C. or Chicago style ban. \n \n McDonald took Heller and applied it to the states. It bodes well for gun rights because it had to declare the right fundamental to get there under the Due Process incorporation route-which means IMO that future challenges to gun laws will force the government involved to pass a strict scrutiny test. And remember the Heller majority said the case would not be the last word on the right. However, we already see anti-gun groups arguing just this point-that the only right we have is to have a handgun within our homes, and that we have no right to carry beyond our front door. The fight now is to continue defining and broadening the right beyond the limited holding of Heller. But I have always argued the right never was and cannot be absolute.",

   "No, Doc.\n \n \n So you don't see discrimination against one right, to keep and bear arms, on the same level of the point of the entire XIVth Amendment, to give Blacks the same rights (including the 2A) found in the first 8 Amendments on the same footing as a business open to the general public? The comparison drawn was that if you can exclude freedmen from those businesses you can exclude people exercising their other rights in the BOR.\n \n \nDoc, if you don't even know who runs the jails and prisons in my state, then how can you assume the returns are fantastic?\n\n \n That was my question. I do know who runs a lot of prisons in Texas and used to be called Wackenhut but you never knew that huh? I actually helped train them and got several commendations (wall hangers) and spoke to the graduating classes. They also supply guards for gov't projects like nuclear plants and detention of illegal aliens for the BP and Customs. Don't make assumptions if you don't know.\n \n \nIn Virginia the localities run the jails, either singly or by operating jointly under regional jail authorities, and the state runs the prisons. They all spend far more money housing inmates than they make. In Virginia there are no private prisons that make money on each inmate they house. The only inmates Virginia makes any money on are ones we house on contract from Pennsylvania-which pays Virginia more than our cost to house them because it can't find room for them back home. The cost to the taxpayer of the entire system is far greater than the system makes in return on fines and costs.\n\n \n BINGO! That should be an inspiration. :) It is all about JUSTICE right?\n \n \nBut maybe your conspiracy theory involves vast sums of money going into the pockets of individual players in the system? I don't know. All I know is I'm not getting any of it, and where the money goes or how much of it goes is not something that I base my decisions upon. I'm not my brother's keeper, and I'm not going to try and stop you from hating on the system. I'm just saying don't hate on me without facts that apply to me.\n \n \n Nope, it is free play on the stock market. I just don't want you to get the idea that the system is as sweet and pure as you would like to think. \"hating on the system\" is a little rank for you isn't it? Do not ever doubt I know what I am talking about. I have told you that you are one in a million; that was a compliment. I wish everyone had the same blind faith and trust in their fellow man; your position is a direct indicator that kind of thinking is faulty :) You got a good heart and good perspective and everyone involved in LE shoulod have the same qualities and merits. You should have learned by now this is not so. I am not \"hating on you\". I am simply prying your eyes open a bit to reality; age does have it's benefits. When you get your first 'revelation' do let me know.\n \n \nDoc, what do you mean when you say absolute?\n\n \n Exactly what the founders and the Court(s) have said. You don't want to go back and tell us black folks we is only half free with no rights do you? Maybe you want to go to Bivins and Reid AND see if you can find a loophole in the BOR that says they are not absolute. Recognized as PRE-EXISTING is self evident to me. Maybe you got different ideas?\n \n \n \n \nThe whole P&I argument was about more than the RKBA. It was an attempt to have the Court use the 14th. Amendment to \"cut and paste\" against the states every portion of each of the first 8 amendments in the BoR. IMO, that was the goal of the creators of the 14th.\n\n \n ...AND LACK OF DOING SO AND IGNORING INTENT HAS CAUSED 155 years of suffering and war.\n \n \nBut if SCOTUS had done this there would not be much difference than what we have now as far as the RKBA goes.(SNIP)\n \n \n Yeah it would. Texas had the same thing in it's Constitution at the time that the XIVth Amendment did. We wouldn't have had a Civil War over it nor had reconstruction by tyrants and carpetbaggers who brought oppression and black codes with them (hey, they just had to justify their jobs).\n \n \nBut I have always argued the right never was and cannot be absolute.\n\n \n You better tell VA that then. You got convicted felons getting all their rights back and in public office :)",

   "Thanks Steve. Now I have a clearer picture.\n \nMcDonald merely expanded Heller. I mention McDonald because that applied the 2nd amendment to the states. So unless you live in DC you are better off talking about McDonald. \n\n I think this is the more correct answer. \n \nMcDonald took Heller and applied it to the states.\n\n \n \nMaybe. Arms means \"weapons that were not specifically designed for military use and were not employed in a military capacity\"\n\n That is just half of the definition. \n \n   Heller \n Before addressing the verbs &#8220;keep&#8221; and &#8220;bear,&#8221; we interpret their object: &#8220;Arms.&#8221; The 18th-century meaning is no different from the meaning today. The 1773 edition of Samuel Johnson&#8217;s dictionary defined &#8220;arms&#8221; as &#8220;weapons of offence, or armour of defence.&#8221; 1 Dictionary of the English Language 107 (4th ed.) (hereinafter Johnson). Timothy Cunningham&#8217;s important 1771 legal dictionary defined &#8220;arms&#8221; as &#8220;any thing that a man wears for his defence, or takes into his hands, or useth in wrath to cast at or strike another.&#8221; 1 A New and Complete Law Dictionary (1771); see also N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (reprinted 1989) (hereinafter Webster) (similar). The term was applied, then as now, to weapons that were not specifically designed for military use and were not employed in a military capacity. For instance, Cunningham&#8217;s legal dictionary gave as an example of usage: &#8220;Servants and labourers shall use bows and arrows on Sundays, &c. and not bear other arms.&#8221; See also, e.g., An Act for the trial of Negroes, 1797 Del. Laws ch. XLIII, \u00a76, p. 104, in 1 First Laws of the State of Delaware 102, 104 (J. Cushing ed. 1981 (pt. 1)); see generally State v. Duke, 42 Tex. 455, 458 (1874) (citing decisions of state courts construing &#8220;arms&#8221;). Although one founding-era thesaurus limited &#8220;arms&#8221; (as opposed to &#8220;weapons&#8221;) to &#8220;instruments of offence generally made use of in war,&#8221; even that source stated that all firearms constituted &#8220;arms.&#8221; 1 J. Trusler, The Distinction Between Words Esteemed Synonymous in the English Language 37 (1794) (emphasis added).\n \n Johnson defined &#8220;keep&#8221; as, most relevantly, &#8220;[t]o retain; not to lose,&#8221; and &#8220;[t]o have in custody.&#8221; Johnson 1095. Webster defined it as &#8220;[t]o hold; to retain in one&#8217;s power or possession.&#8221; No party has apprised us of an idiomatic meaning of &#8220;keep Arms.&#8221; Thus, the most natural reading\n of &#8220;keep Arms&#8221; in the Second Amendment is to &#8220;have weapons.&#8221;\n \n At the time of the founding, as now, to &#8220;bear&#8221; meant to &#8220;carry.&#8221; See Johnson 161; Webster; T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1796); 2 Oxford English Dictionary 20 (2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter Oxford). When used with &#8220;arms,&#8221; however, the term has a meaning\n that refers to carrying for a particular purpose&#8212;confrontation. In Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125 (1998), in the course of analyzing the meaning of &#8220;carries a firearm&#8221; in a federal criminal statute, JUSTICE GINSBURG wrote that &#8220;[s]urely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution&#8217;s Second Amendment . . . indicate[s]: &#8216;wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.&#8217; &#8221; \n\n Then there is this!\n   Supreme Court UNITED STATES v. MILLER, 307 U.S. 174 (1939) \n In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State of Tennessee, 2 Humph., Tenn., 154, 158.\n \n (Speaking of militias and militia duties.) And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time. &#8230;&#8230;.. This implied the general obligation of all adult male inhabitants to possess arms, and, with certain exceptions, to [307 U.S. 174, 180] cooperate in the work of defence.' 'The possession of arms also implied the possession of ammunition, and the authorities paid quite as much attention to the latter as to the former.' 'A year later (1632) it was ordered that any single man who had not furnished himself with arms might be put out to service, and this became a permanent part of the legislation of the colony (Massachusetts).' \n\n We can't just throw out Miller because we have Heller/McDonald!",

In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n \n More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.\n\n That is why they are called Fundamental! These rights are so fundamental that one would have to end our Constitution, and start all over! \n \n Our Founders, in order to start this country, created an absolutely binding contract that our Founders, and the Government they created signed. ALL government and the people are bound by it! Period! \n \n  Rule of Law: Fundamental Rights of Citizens Democracies exist to serve their people \n Democracies rest on the principle that government exists to serve the people. In other words, the people are citizens of the democratic state, not its subjects. \n \n Because the state protects the rights of its citizens, they, in turn, give the state their loyalty. Under an authoritarian system, by contrast, the state demands loyalty and service from its people without any reciprocal obligation to secure their consent for its actions.\n \n The relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy.

I'll admit I don't know your experiences, and I know you don't know mine.\n \n I don't follow what you are getting at with the Google search you pointed me to. It has information and complaints about CIA torture, private security companies, rendition, secret jails, etc. I don't \"associate\" with this stuff, nor am I a part of this \"industry.\" None of this has anything to do with me, Doc. The sites that come up on your search have nothing to do with the state criminal justice system in Virginia. I truly have about as much contact with the CIA, Xe, Wackenhut, or any other federal government security contractor as you do. \n \n \n Exactly what the founders and the Court(s) have said. You don't want to go back and tell us black folks we is only half free with no rights do you? Maybe you want to go to Bivins and Reid AND see if you can find a loophole in the BOR that says they are not absolute. Recognized as PRE-EXISTING is self evident to me. Maybe you got different ideas? \n\n \n Maybe this answer has cleared it up for me then. It sounds like you are using the word \"absolute\" to mean rights which pre-exist the government and are not dependent upon the government for their existence. If that is the case then we are in perfect agreement. I have always argued that the RKBA pre-existed the Constitution, that it is an inherent individual right, that it is not a right granted by our government, and one need not seek the government's permission to claim the free exercise of the right. I got your back on that argument.\n \n I want to make sure you are not saying the scope of the right is absolute in the sense that there can be no restriction on the possession or use of firearms for any person for any reason at any time. That is not what the court has said.\n \n \n You're in trouble if you are relying on a rule made up by the courts to protect your rights. Five judges that did not like the Heller ruling will say anything passes the \"strict scrutiny\" test. There is no standard for these kinds of things and this is really the danger of using the due process clause to incorporate the amendments. Substantive due process rights are too easy to manipulate. \n\n \n And yet that is exactly where we are (and for all of our rights incorporated against the states-not just the RKBA). I'm only telling everyone what the Court is doing and what the legal theories are behind it. I don't control SCOTUS or have any influence on its decisions....\"Strict Scrutiny\" is the most \"individual right friendly\" and protective test SCOTUS uses, and we cannot reasonably expect anything better (but we could have had it a lot worse if Sotomayor had gotten her way). We need to use this test to make as much hay as we can while the sun still shines. \n \n \n You may be forced into the position to defend these laws by the contract you have with your jurisdiction, but the question I have is, are they the way you would like to see them for Constitutional purity? You can elect not to answer that question if you feel it to be injudicious. \n\n \n Well Tither here are a few examples from Virginia's laws that I prosecute all the time without loss of sleep:\n \n Possession of a firearm by convicted felon, with mandatory 2 and 5 year prison sentences depending on whether the prior conviction was a violent (example, rape) or non-violent (example, larceny) felony. You don't want to lose your RKBA, then don't go committing felonies. If you do, then you lose your right but can ask to get it back. I see a lot of these requests from people who have pulled their time and spent years back out in society without any more problems, and I cannot think of one request that I have ever opposed-or later regretted. \n \n Possession of a firearm while possessing with the intent to distribute cocaine, with a mandatory five years in prison. I tack this charge on top of drug distribution charges every darned chance I get because many times drug dealers get more time on this gun charge than they get for selling cocaine. I do not believe our RKBA extends to include a right to shoot at others to protect your drug trade. You want to exercise the RKBA, then don't be a drug dealer.\n \n Using a firearm in a violent felony. Three year mandatory sentence added on if you use a gun to commit a violent felony. You want to exercise your RKBA, then don't use your gun to help you commit a rape, robbery or murder. I don't believe the Right to Keep and Bear arms includes a right to use them to commit crimes. \n \n So there are three examples of limitations on firearms. What do others here think about them?\n \n We all talk a lot about fighting gun crime. People like Brady blame the gun and say because one man uses a gun to harm someone then no one can be trusted with guns. That's like telling me I can no longer be trusted to have a 6 pack in my fridge because the police just caught someone else driving drunk. I prefer to blame the people who choose to commit the crimes. We should hold them (and them alone) accountable for their actions, and we don't punish you or me by taking away our rights because some else chose to abuse theirs. A man bent on murder with a gun can throw away his own RKBA by what he does, but no one has the moral authority to hold my right or your right hostage because of the actions of the murderer. \n \n When we say \"shall not be infringed\" we mean the protected RKBA. But the \"shall not be infringed\" language cannot bootstrap the RKBA to make it mean a right to have any weapon, anywhere, used for any purpose, at anytime. This is why I say it is not \"absolute.\" Inherent to the individual, not granted by government-yes-but not absolute in scope. \n \n And neither is it as limited as the Heller ruling. SCOTUS has given us due process incorporation and fundamental right status. Heller clearly tells us its ruling is the beginning of the definition of the RKBA. The fight now for those of us who wish to continue peacefully exercising our RKBA is to encourage SCOTUS to expand the scope of protected activities beyond where we are in Heller.",

It was a call to protect the Constitution and to start fixing the injustices. Let me recap!\nNot Absolute in the fact that no one is arguing that those in prison, should be armed! Although that might be a novel and effective Criminal Justice technique. emoticon_smile \n \n The fact that we have 22 to 30 thousand gun laws already on the books makes that a moot point! However, that does not mean that the way things are now, are the way they were intended by the Framers, nor those who wrote the 14th Amendment! Etc. \n\n \n\n \"The said Constitution [shall] be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press, or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.\" -- Massachusetts' U.S. Constitution ratification convention, 1788 \n\n I think what you posted falls in line with that! That is not, at all, what I am talking about! \n \n Here is an example! If the S.C. would have done it's duty when the 14th had passed, how many Federal Gun laws would have been passed following the institution of the 14th! How many unjust laws would have been passed by the States, and localities? A Huge Screwing of the Constitution's BoR, and We the People, by people entrusted with essential liberties! COME ON! It's the S.C for GOD's SAKE! The President and the Congress let them get away with it too! Hense! \nGovernment, the courts, and Pro-constitutionalists working for government are just as culpable as those who tried to destroy that Right. \n\n If any part of this blame belongs to you, then THAT would be what I wonder if you are loosing sleep over! \n \n Even after Heller/McDonald the antis seek to continue to RAPE the Constitution's BoR, with the intent to distribute their HATE, in a violent felony. And yet, we seem to be complacent about their attitudes! (Sorry for co-opting your words. I could not help myself! emoticon_xangel)\n \n When is enough, enough? When do we put our foot down and start fighting for our Rights? When do we start calling a crime, a crime? What greater crime can their be, then stealing what belongs to you, me, my family, our children and our children's children? As we have seen through he concept of Star diceses, what happens to one of your BoR, sets a president for them all! These things are Actual Crimes, yet we tolerate them and call them dissenting opinions. We call them things like Democracy!\n \n We don't live in a Democracy. We live in a Republic where the rule of law and the Constitution says that, the Law, or the Bor and one person is an unconquerable Super Majority that no man can overcome! \n [url=&quot;Pastor Martin Niem\u00f6ller&quot;] First, they came for the Jews. But I was not a Jew, so I did not speak up.\n \n Then they came for the communists.\n But I was not a communist, so I did not speak up.\n \n Then they came for the trade unionists.\n But I was not a trade unionist, so I did not speak up.\n \n And when they came for me, there was no one left to speak out for me. [/quote]\n That my friend is what I am saying! We should not tolerate the continued theft of essential Liberties! If the Founders could see us now, I think they would kick our butts for wasting their precious blood and their guts to fight the Most Powerful army the world had even known, in order to secure these Rights! Even now, after Heller/McDonald, we seem to be letting them urinate on those essential liberties, that are even called Fundamental, by letting the antis walk all over our Constitution with their dirty muddy feet! We have proof! The Constitution says, what we said it did, and they were lying! \n \n Lets be working on restoring our honor. I say, honorable people do not sit idly by and let theft happen!",

No mater what the Contract we made with government says, (The Constitution)   nor what the Government says about the contract (The Constitution)! \n \n But I'll humor you thus far, because it pleases me to do so. \n \n First off, you do know Jesus' men were armed?\n   Mathew 26 \n 50 Jesus replied, \"Friend, do what you came for.\" \n Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him. \n \n 51 With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. \n \n \n   Luke 22 - 35 and 36 \n 35Then Jesus asked them, \"When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?\" \n \n \"Nothing,\" they answered. \n \n 36 He said to them, \"But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.\n\n Then I'll point out that our Framers wrote this! \n   \n The Declaration of Independence \n When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes;\n\n \n The Constitution Society sums it up this way.   From the Constitution Society \n There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the \"right to keep and bear arms\". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. \n \n < (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any \"natural\" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or \"self-evident\", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed \"natural rights\" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea \n \n < (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution. \n \n \n Natural Law. Something that is self-evident. Observable in Nature. \n \n Self Defense. All creatures have the Fight of Flight instinct. It is something hard wired into their DNA. Hence everyone has the Right of Self Defense! So this is an example of a Good Given, or Natures God if you don't believe, Inalienable Right.\n \n If we disobey the Law, we go to jail. Boundaries were set up to protect We the People from the kind of government abuse that you are trying to inflict on us with your sophistry, and with your disrespect to Constitutional Principles, the Supreme Law of the Land. \n   Preamble to the bill of Rights \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution \n \n Then they laid out the restrictions against Government in the Bill of Rights, which President Obama correctly called a list of Negative Rights against Government.\n \n Now it appears that you want to find some kind of a loophole to this restriction placed on Government! We are all better off when everyone obeys the laws and our Constitution. We rightfully expect Government to do the same!",

Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed?

   "First I'd like to say I really like the quote from Sam Adams dropped here earlier. IMO it's no coincidence that the label of a Sam Adams reads \"Brewer\" and \"Patriot.\"\n \n I'm going to agree with Steeeeve for a moment: I believe the 2nd. Amendment could be \"amended\" out of the Constitution. The power exists in Article V, and the passage and subsequent repeal of prohibition provides the precedent.\n \n But here is a better set of questions I'm throwing out for anyone to answer: \n \n Do you really want to repeal it? \n \n (I hope not) \n \n If you could do so, then would you repeal it and why? \n \n (before you answer know that if you come to me looking for support to repeal an amendment for the purpose of taking away any of my rights, then my answer is \"molon labe\") \n \n What do you think would happen if you did repeal it? \n \n (All H--- would break loose-no-wait, the RKBA was not created by the 2nd. Amendment, it was only recognized by it) \n \n Would repealing it mean we have no RKBA? \n \n (Absolutely not)\n \n Whatever happened to the federalist belief in a government limited by enumerated powers? \n \n (Wait, that concept died long ago. Now the government thinks everything not specifically prohibited by the BoR is fair game-all the more reason not to give others the idea that it's OK to take a bottle of white-out to the BoR to get rid of portions of the Constitution they don't like. If you say repeal the 2nd, then what do you say when someone else says let's also repeal the 4th., 5th., or 6th.?) \n \n If the amendment were repealed, would we still have a natural right of self-defense against not only tyrants but also private persons bent on offering violence to us and our families-and a corresponding right to peaceably keep and bear arms for that purpose? \n \n (I say yes-absolutely and unequivocally). \n \n I say these two rights were recognized long before 1789:\n \n And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim. Cicero , Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)\n \n For those who can possess and wield arms are in a position to decide whether the constitution is to continue or not.  Aristotle, Politics, T. Sinclair Trans. 1962, p. 274. \n \n Rome remained free for four hundred years and Sparta eight hundred, although their citizens were armed all that time; but many other states that have been disarmed have lost their liberties in less than forty years. Machiavelli, The Art of War, p. 30 (E. Farnsworth, transl. 1965)\n \n An armed republic submits less easily to the rule of one of its citizens than a republic armed by foreign forces. Rome and Sparta were for many centuries well-armed and free. The Swiss are well-armed and enjoy great freedom. . . .Among other evils caused by being disarmed, it renders you contemptible. . . . It is not reasonable to suppose that one who is armed will obey willingly one who is unarmed; or that any unarmed man will remain safe among armed servants. Machiavelli, The Prince, pp. 73 & 81 (L. Ricci, trans. 1952)\n \n If a slave, says Plato, defends himself, and kills a freeman, he ought to be treated as a parricide. This is a civil law which punishes self-defense, though dictated by nature. . . .\n \n It is unreasonable. . .to oblige a man not to attempt the defense of his own life. . . .\n \n Who does not see that self-defense is a duty superior to every precept. . . .\n \n (T)he laws of an Italian republic (Venice), where bearing fire-arms is punished as a capital crime and where it is not more fatal to make an ill use of them than to carry them, is not agreeable to the nature of things. Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, pp. 59, 60, 64, and 79-80 (trans. T. Nugent, 1899).\n \n (A) covenant not to defend myself by force, from force, is always void. For. . .no man can transfer, or lay down his Right to save himself from Death. Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, pp. 88 & 95, (1964 ed.)\n \n Whereas, by supposing they have given up themselves to the absolute power and will of the legislator, they have disarmed themselves, and armed him, to make prey of them when he pleases. . . .For then mankind will be in a far worse condition than in the state of nature, if they shall have armed one, or a few men, with the joint power of a multitude to force them to obey at pleasure the exorbitant and unlimited decrees of their sudden thoughts, or unrestrained, and, til that moment, unknown wills, without having any measures set down which may guide an justify their actions. John Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government, pp. 114-15 ( Chicago , 1955)\n \n And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Our ancestors, by being always armed, and frequently in action, defended themselves against the Romans, Danes, and English; and maintained their liberty against encroachments of their own princes. Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749).\n \n The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall present mention, is that of having arms for their defense, suitable to their condition and degree and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the same statute W & M st. 2.c.2. [ie. The Bill of Rights] and it is indeed a public allowance under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression. In these several articles consist the rights, or as they are frequently termed, the liberties of Englishmen. . . .\n And we have seen that these rights. . .consist, primarily, in the free enjoyment of personal security, of personal liberty, and of private property. So long as these remain inviolate, the subject is perfectly free; for every species of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act in opposition to one or other of these rights. To preserve these from violation, it is necessary that the constitution of parliaments be supported in it[s] full vigor. . . .And lastly, to vindicate these rights, when actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in the first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the courts of law; next to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances; and lastly, to the right of having and using arms for self preservation and defense. Sir William Blackstone, 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England, p. 136 & 140 (1st. ed. 1765, reprinted 1979). \n \n The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.  Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia , in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300.\n \n Instances of the licentious and outrageous behavior of the military conservators of the peace still multiply upon us, some of which are of such a nature, and have been carried to so great lengths, as must serve fully to evince that a late vote of this town, calling upon the inhabitants to provide themselves with arms for their defense, was a measure as prudent as it was legal. . . .It is a natural right which the people have reserved to themselves, confirmed by the Bill of Rights, to keep arms for their defense; and as Mr. Blackstone observes, it is to be made use of when the sanctions of society and law are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression. O. Dickerson ed., Boston Under Military Rule, p79 (1936) [quoting from what was at the time the most widely circulated periodical in the colonies, A Journal of the Times.\n \n It is certainly beyond human art and sophistry, to prove that the British subjects, to whom the privilege of possessing arms is expressly recognized by the Bill of Rights,. . .are guilty of an illegal act, in calling upon one another to be provided with them, as the law directs. Id at p.61\n \n And from the From the DECLARATION OF THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF TAKING UP ARMS, authored by Thomas Jefferson and John Dickenson, and adopted by the Continental Congress on July 6, 1775. (Starting at p. 286 in Sources Of Our Liberties, American Bar Foundation, Richard L. Perry, editor, revised edition (William S. Hein & Co. 1990)) (in particular, note what happened to the arms the citizens of Boston had gathered in accordance with the vote they took to arm themselves for their own defense):\n \n But why should we enumerate out injuries in detail? By one statute it is declared that parliament can 'of right make laws to bind us in all cases whatsoever.' What is to defend us against so enormous, so unlimited a power? Not a single man of those who assume it, is chosen by us; or is subject to our control or influence; but, on the contrary, they are all of them exempt from the operation of such laws, and an American revenue, if not diverted from the ostensible purposes for which it is raised, would actually lighten their own burdens in proportion, as they increase ours. We saw the misery to which such despotism would reduce us. We for ten years incessantly and ineffectually besieged the throne as supplicants; we reasoned, we remonstrated with parliament, in the most mild and decent language.\n Administration sensible that we should regard these oppressive measure as freemen ought to do, sent over fleets and armies to enforce them.\n General Gage . . . sent ought from [Boston] a large detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked assault on the inhabitants of the said province, at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of a great many persons, some of whom were officers and soldiers of the detachment, murdered eight of the inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord , where they set upon another party of the inhabitants of the same province, killing several and wounding more, until compelled to retreat by the country people suddenly assembled to repel this cruel aggression.\n \n The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind.\n \n The general, further emulating his ministerial masters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th. of June, after venting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies, proceeds to '[D]eclare them all, either by name or description, to be rebels and traitors, to supersede the course of the common law, and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise of the law martial.'\n \n We are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission to the tyranny of irritated ministers, or resistance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the cost of this contest, and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery. Honor, justice, and humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them, if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon them.\n \n Our cause is Just. Our Union is Perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable. - We gratefully acknowledge, as signal instances of the Divine favor towards us, that his Providence would not permit us to be called into this severe controversy, until we were grown up to our present strength, had been previously exercised in warlike operation, and possessed of the means of defending ourselves. With hearts fortified with these animating reflections, we most solemnly, before God and the world, declare, that, exerting the utmost energy of those powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness and perseverance, employ for the preservation of our liberties; being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves.\n \n We fight not for glory or for conquest. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation or even suspicion of offence. They boast of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than servitude or death.\n \n In our own native land, in defense of the freedom that is our birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it - for the protection of our property, acquired solely by the honest industry of our fore-fathers and ourselves, against violence actually offered, we have taken up arms. We shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed, and not before.\n \n Did the founders believe we had a natural right of self-defense and a natural right to keep and, if necessary, to bear arms long before the 2nd. Amendment was drafted? \n \n You be the judge.",

   "It remains totally inconceivable, that since the Revolutionary War started when the British came to both Lexington and Concord to seize the powder stores, disarming people along the way, that our Founders would have let anyone disarm them! Period! Repeal of the first 8 amendment, but Especially the Right to keep and Bear Arms, was not part of the deal for ratification of our Constitution! \n \n   FEDERALIST No. 28 HAMILTON \n If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that  original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government,   and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense.  The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair.  The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo.\n \n The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state, provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them. \n\n I'd call repeal of the First 8, but especially the 2nd, a breach of our Contract! A Usurpation! That would be an act of War, for how can any of the above be true, if you, and or the Government, could disarm We the People? Repeal of the first 8 was NOT part of the deal! For if one could repeal the 2nd, they could, and probably would, repeal them all! In other words, YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS! And that thought is a scam! \n \n Inalienable Rights were the promise when We the People started this country! As I have posted, Ohio's Bill of Rights declares this an Inalienable promise as well! \n \n The Declaration of Independence declares them to be Unalienable too. \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\" \n \n Besides the Hamilton quote on the top of the page. \n \nThe Sacred Rights of Mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchment,. or musty records. They are written with a sun beam in whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself, and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power. \n\n also says:  Our National Archives \n The fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process. To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable.\n\n If the PROMISE of the Inalienable Rights in the Bill of Rights was not made as a guarantee, the Constitution would have never been ratified. There would be no United States! Repeal of Inalienable Rights? Those thoughts are, to quote the above passage, Unthinkable to our whole concept of Liberty! It is an anti-republican idea! \n \n   Preamble Bill of Rights \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution \n\n The guarantees are all through our Founding Documents! \n \n You can't make the promise Inalienable Rights as part of the deal then say some one can take them away! Inalienable Rights ARE the Contract! Period! \n \n They are even called Fundamental! Why?\n \n   US Supreme Court: Fundamental Rights \nThe justices of the Supreme Court have defined fundamental rights to be those without which neither liberty nor justice would exist. They are freedoms essential to the concept of ordered liberty, inherent in human nature, and consequently inalienable (Palko v. Connecticut, 1937).\n\n \n   Fundamental Rights \n these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.\n \n \n That IS the Promise! \n \n Sorry Brian, you may be a darn good lawyer, but you are mistaken! That would totally invalidate the contract! But for the record, I note that you did say \n(before you answer know that if you come to me looking for support to repeal an amendment for the purpose of taking away any of my rights, then my answer is (&#8220;molon labe&#8221;) \n\n For the uninformed,   Molon labe \n The Greek phrase Mol&#333;n labe, meaning \"Come and take them\" is a classical expression of defiance reportedly by King Leonidas in response to the Persian army's demand that the Spartans surrender their weapons at the Battle of Thermopylae. It corresponds roughly to the modern equivalent English phrase \"over my dead body\", \"bring it on\" or, most closely, \"come and get it\". \n",

   "More examples that, to secure our Federal Government, Inalienable Rights ARE the Contract! \n   Constitution of the State of Illinois \nSECTION 1. INHERENT AND INALIENABLE RIGHTS\n All men are by nature free and independent and have certain inherent and inalienable rights among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To secure these rights and the protection of property, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the\n governed.\n \n   THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF HAWAII \n Section 2.

Among these rights are the enjoyment of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and the acquiring and possessing of property.\n \n   New Hampshire \n [Art.] 2. [Natural Rights.] All men have certain natural, essential, and inherent rights - among which are, the enjoying and defending life and liberty; acquiring, possessing, and protecting, property; and, in a word, of seeking and obtaining happiness.\n \n [Art.] 2-a. [The Bearing of Arms.] All persons have the right to keep and bear arms in defense of themselves, their families, their property and the state.\n \n \n I suspect that most states have Inalienable Rights as a GUARANTEE for the Right to govern too! \n \n \n\n \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.\" -- Proposed Virginia Constitution, 1776 \n\n \n\n \"The said Constitution [shall] be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press, or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.\" -- Massachusetts' U.S. Constitution ratification convention, 1788 \n\n \n\n .

They are beyond the whim of the majority! \n \n   Rule of Law: Fundamental Rights of Citizens Democracies exist to serve their people  \nBy no means is this an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold.

You'd get a bunch of states banning guns. This would be challenged in court as a violation of the 14th amendment to due process rights because people would claim it is a substantive right even though it was just repealed out of the constitution. It would probably be the same people who all along complained about \"legislating from the bench\" only to come back and use that when it benefits them.

All nine Justices agreed.\n\n Why would that even an issue if you were correct Steve? Again, because the 2nd Amendment ONLY acknowledged the fact that that our Right existed long before the Constitution did! \n \n However, and more importantly, could this be a trial attempt, a thinly veiled attempt, to to change our Constitution! \n   Elena Kagan's disturbing refusal to acknowledge pre-existing rights \n According to the Declaration of Independence, people create government to protect their pre-existing, inalienable rights. Yet when Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) asked Kagan whether armed self-defense is one of those rights, she professed agnosticism. \n \n But was Kagan right to say that natural rights should play no role in constitutional interpretation? \"I'm not saying I do not believe that there are rights pre-existing the Constitution and the laws,\" she said, but \"you should not want me to act in any way on the basis of such a belief, if I had one,\" because \"my job as a justice is to enforce the Constitution and the laws.\"\n \n Although justices should not read their own idiosyncratic notions of natural rights into the Constitution, the concept is essential to understanding what the Framers were trying to do. In addition to the Declaration of Independence, which reflects the Framers' philosophical premises but does not have the force of law, the Constitution itself repeatedly refers to pre-existing rights.\n \n The First Amendment does not say, \"The people shall have a right to freedom of speech.\" It says, \"Congress shall make no law&#8230;abridging the freedom of speech.\" Likewise with \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms\" and \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.\"\n \n These are not rights the government creates; they are pre-existing rights the government is bound to respect. There is no other way to make sense of the Ninth Amendment: \"The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\"\n \n By contrast, here is how Kagan summarized the Supreme Court's conclusion in the 2008 case D.C. v. Heller (emphasis added): \"The Second Amendment confers&#8230;an individual right to keep and bear arms.\" What the decision actually said is that the Second Amendment acknowledges that right. \"It has always been widely understood,\" the Court explained, \"that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right\" that was considered \"one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen.\"\n \n That point was crucial in deciding, as the Court did last week, that the Second Amendment applies to the states via the 14th Amendment. Some theory of pre-existing, fundamental rights is also necessary in applying neglected yet important constitutional provisions such as the Ninth Amendment and the 14th Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause.\n \n Constitutional interpretation aside, Kagan's reluctance to endorse the concept of pre-existing rights was troubling because without it we cannot draw moral distinctions between legal regimes. How can we condemn a dictator for legally authorized oppression, or say that our own Constitution is better now that it bans slavery than it was when it tacitly approved the practice? The traditional American answer is that people have certain rights by virtue of being human, regardless of what the law says.\n\n Now I hope America Gets it! It is just another scam on the Constitution in order to destroy it!",

Like so many other Virginians, he was an anti-federalist, though he eventually accepted the new Constitution with the promise of the Bill of Rights as a hedge against the establishment of an American monarchy - which still had a good deal of currency. The Articles of Confederation afforded such freedoms that he had become convinced that even with the incumbent loss of liberty, some new form of government would be required.

It's about time we called people like you out.\n\n Well Steve, it has been my distinct pleasure to let you talk, so everyone can see just how radical the anti-gun position actually is.

BAM! Your and Kagan's scam takes place, then since they are all registered, you believe you can get some flunky to try and collect them for our citizens who posses Constitutionally recognized as protected, Pre-existing Inalienable Rights! \n \n   Kagan dodges and weaves on natural rights \n Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan is getting some flak because under questioning by Sen. Tom Coburn she refused to recognize \"natural rights\" outside of the U.S. Constitution, presumably including those mentioned in our Declaration of Independence. The Oklahoma Republican then asked Kagan if she believes American citizens have \"a fundamental right\" to own firearms for self-defense, which he noted the great English jurist William Blackstone described as a \"natural right.\" Kagan responded by saying, \"To be honest with you, I don't have a view of what are natural rights independent of the Constitution.\"\n \n Coburn pressed, asking Kagan if her response meant \"you wouldn't embrace what the Declaration says, that we have certain God-given rights, and that among these are the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?\" Kagan replied that \"my job as a justice is to enforce the Constitution and the laws.\" She emphasized that she was \"not saying that I do not believe there are not rights pre-existing the Constitution and laws.\"\n \n genuinely substantial discussion of a fundamental issue of constitutional law.\n That issue is this: Do we each have rights because they are granted to us by government, or because those rights exist whether government recognizes them or not? That's what the American Revolution was all about. George III and the English Parliament said our rights were no more or less than what they granted to us. We replied in our Declaration of Independence that we each have \"certain inalienable rights\" that are independent of and superior to the will of our governors, thus legitimate law requires the consent of the governed.\n \n Strictly speaking, Kagan was right to insist that her duty as a Supreme Court justice would be to rule based on the Constitution; it is the governing document for all Americans, including those we elect to govern us. But her carefully chosen words on this issue could come back to haunt her. Note that she described the duties of a justice as to \"enforce the Constitution and laws,\" thus suggesting that the latter command an authority equal to the former. In fact, the Constitution is superior to the laws because they must conform to its requirements. But if the rights recognized by the Constitution aren't independent of and superior to government, then they will be whatever those who write and interpret the laws say they are, just as George III and the English Parliament claimed.\n\n You guys are dangerous to precious liberties that I am many others fought for, and many gave their precious lives for to preserve. \n \n Doc is a Patriot!",

   "What you are going to see is a lot of BS State and Federal laws bite the dust of the 2A that have been created simply by putting them in the Federal register. That is like law by fiat and the real tyranny that you fail to understand. Executive orders are another method of bypassing the Constitution and should lead to impeachment.\n \n CAN YOU HEAR US NOW?\n \n There will be huge changes in November, you already got some previews :)\n \n Go ahead and have some fun while you can; this era is about to fade quietly into the sunset and a new day is dawning much to your consternation.

Here is the wording of the Repeal Amendment:\n \n \n \"Any provision of law or regulation of the United States may be repealed by the several states, and such repeal shall be effective when the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states approve resolutions for this purpose that particularly describe the same provision or provisions of law or regulation to be repealed.\" \n \n As we explain:\n \n \n At present, the only way for states to contest a federal law or regulation is to bring a constitutional challenge in federal court or seek an amendment to the Constitution. A state repeal power provides a targeted way to reverse particular congressional acts and administrative regulations without relying on federal judges or permanently amending the text of the Constitution to correct a specific abuse. \n \n The Repeal Amendment should not be confused with the power to \"nullify\" unconstitutional laws possessed by federal courts. Unlike nullification, a repeal power allows two-thirds of the states to reject a federal law for policy reasons that are irrelevant to constitutional concerns. In this sense, a state repeal power is more like the president's veto power.\n \n This amendment reflects confidence in the collective wisdom of the men and women from diverse backgrounds, and elected by diverse constituencies, who comprise the modern legislatures of two-thirds of the states. Put another way, it allows thousands of democratically elected representatives outside the Beltway to check the will of 535 elected representatives in Washington, D.C.\n \n Congress could re-enact a repealed measure if it really feels that two-thirds of state legislatures are out of touch with popular sentiment. And congressional re-enactment would require merely a simple majority. In effect, with repeal power the states could force Congress to take a second look at a controversial law.\n \n You can read the whole thing here. (If this link is behind the subscriber wall, use the email button to send the page to yourself. You will receive an email with a link that will work for 7 days.) \n \n Some readers may recall this was idea was one of the 10 amendments that comprised the Bill of Federalism I proposed in a Forbes.com article over a year ago. Of all those proposals, this one is the most transparent in its meaning and effect, and has the virtue of being \"self-executing\" in the sense that it does not rely on the judiciary to check the powers of Congress. \n \n Not only has the idea gained the interest of the Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegate and several state legislators in Virginia, but legislators from other states have expressed enthusiasm as well. And I know at least one Congressman who would like to sponsor it in the House. So you may well be hearing more about this in the future. If you do, remember you heard it here first.\n \n UPDATE: On Opinio Juris Julian Ku asks \"If the States Can Repeal Federal Law, Can They Also \"Repeal\" Treaties?\" The language of the Repeal Amendment adopts that of the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, which reads (with my brackets inserted):\n \n \n This Constitution, and  the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land. . . . \n \n So according to the Constitution, \"laws of the United States\" made in pursuance of the Constitution are distinct from either the Constitution itself or treaties, though all three comprise the \"law of the land.\"[/B]\n \n \n \n\n \n Now Mr. Tither keeps posting and getting ignored or worse by uneducated people, keeps posting the fact that 38 States signed on to protect the 2A from infringement. CAN YOU HEAR US NOW?",

   "No one is saying that Article 5 does not exist! No one is saying that that the BoR can&#8217;t be added to, nor some of these amendments cannot be done away with. Heck, no one is saying that the entire constitution can&#8217;t be done away with if We the People choose to.\n \n However there exist some basic level of structure that the entire system rests upon. Take one of the legs from the stool, and it all falls! \n \n Remembering that, our Founders wrist this country from a tyrannical ruler, and fought the most powerful army the world had ever known, and many paid the ultimate sacrifice. Afterward though, this country was theirs! It belongs to no one but them! No one ruled over them. No One at all! They were totally free! Totally! \n \n Now I understand that this is over simplistic, States and the Articles of Confederation, but bear with me. \n \n The Federalist wanted a strong Central government, and We the People asked for specific guarantees that, one, our government could not go rogue, and two, that their exist a set of core Rights that the government could not EVER TAKE AWAY! Some said no! Then our founders said, OK! Cool, No Problem, We did not want your central government rule anyway. See ya later, Dork Wads! \n \n So they realized in order to create this government, that we now have, they had no choice but to give in to their demands. \n \n What they came up with was a set of rules called the constitution. We delegated to the government some very awesome powers over us. They could abuse those powers and even kill us, if they chose to abuse us. So they set up a set of core, irreducible Rights that were absolutely guaranteed. The Preamble to the Bill of Rights puts it this way. \n \n   Preamble Bill of Rights \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution \n\n \n It is highly recognized, even from the government itself, that:\n   Rule of Law: Fundamental Rights of Citizens -- Democracies exist to serve their people \n More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly and the right to equal protection before the law.\n \n By no means is this an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor are they subject to the whim of an electoral majority.\n\n \n We call some rights First Rights, Fundamental Rights, Inalienable Rights, which this society, and this government MUST rest upon, or it would be unjust! \n \n   US Supreme Court: Fundamental Rights \n The justices of the Supreme Court have defined fundamental rights to be those without which neither liberty nor justice would exist. They are freedoms essential to the concept of ordered liberty, inherent in human nature, and consequently inalienable (Palko v. Connecticut, 1937).\n \n \n That is what Fundamental means. The Supreme Court now declares some of these Rights Fundamental through the concept of Incorporation! That is what we are saying! \n \n Now you want to change the contract, and take even that away from us!",

You jump on some stupid point like a chicken on a grasshopper and run around like you done something no chicken ever done before. I am going to tell you one last time and you either catch it or you belong in an institution.\n \n Congress has the power to make laws Article 1, section 3.

If Article V is by passed that is the same thing as repealing it by not following the procedure for it's use in making an amendment = law. An EO by the presidents (not just the current one) has the same effect bypassing Article V and imposing law on the States and the People. That is tyrannical either way by imposing laws on the people they do not want and having no chance to vote on so it is tyrannical. Your point that, and these are your exact words in bold...yet the bill of rights references Article V for passage. Now, whacko, do you make the connection? Article V has been ignored and bypassed by the government all along. What is proposed is a solution giving the 10 Amendment a chance to make things right and avoid abuse of Article V. \n \n \nSo we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but Article V which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? You've really lost it haven't you.\n\n \n No, the BOR cannot be repealed by government and it is now a civil right in the 2A. If you don't like it, that is tough. There is no power of the government to screw with the BOR. You never had it or I would say \"you lost it!\" The cheap stunts the anti gunners have pulled at avoiding Article V are continually being pointed out but it goes over your head. I think what VA is doing and Mr. Barnett are the best Constitutional accumen I have seen in a long time. and you remain SOS. That bill would have the effect of holding congress and the president to the Constitution and restore the meaning of Article V. which doesn't get used much anymore. Can you tell me if it has been used in your lifetime?\n \n \nWhat do you mean \"SOS\" by the way? Save our ship haha? I have been saving your ship.\n\n \n It means LOST or STUCK ON STUPID. Your choice :xcensored\n \n Have you seen Article V lately? The BOR didn't require Article V for their existence because they are on the same footing and they can't be repealed by Article V because they are LAW on the same footing as the Constitution and can not be repealed any more than the Articles can. Both the 2A and the V article have been ignored too long. It is time to right the ship of State.\n \n The president's job by law/article is to make sure the administrative branch is working properly i.e. well regulated. His orders should only affect the branch he runs, not be a law for \"the people\". And screw agencies that think they can make their own laws, set their salaries and ignore congress and the people by making law by fiat, it is tyrannical and unConstitutional and is best ignored.

   "Since this portion of this thread has been happening, I have been busier that a one legged man in a butt kicking contest! It seems there are several groups of people who like Steve's concept of using Article 5 to get rid of portions of the Bill of Rights they do not like! \n \n There was one group of law enforcement who wanted to get rid of the 4th Amendments unreasonable search and seizures. They were accompanied by a group of lawyers who though trial by jury was too outdated for a modern and sophisticated society like ours. They would much rather prefer to just round up political enemies or just people they did not like, and throw them in jail forever. But only if they kind of liked them! They said they would kill the ones they don't! \n \n Then there was the First Amendment crowd who wanted the free practice of religion to be gone. They said, if people cannot believe in God, and or Nature's God, then man made the Bill of Inalienable Rights, therefore Man can RIP them out of the Constitution forever! \n \n They also thought the right to vote and the right to redress government grievances was a crock! They felt that if they could get rid of the Freedom of the Press and the ability to say what an individual wanted, like on the Internet, then a hindrance to their plans for their New Godless Society, remade in their own image, was possible! \n \n They said that they know that this will take a lot of work but they committed to KILL the Bill of Rights, and they did not care how long it took! This was their gift to a future society! So they asked me what I thought and how long would it take? \n \n I told them Na! You don't have to do all that! All you have to do is get all of the guns registered, then turn them lose to Kill the Second Amendment. After that has been accomplished, and you get the government the way you want it, then use Article 5 to amend Article 5 out of the Constitution! Next send some poor slob out to collect them all! Oh Yeah, the carnage would be devastating, because those who love Freedom WON'T Give them up, but once the guns are gone, you are free to do what ever you want! This will truly be your country! This ALL will belong to you! For what could they really do to stop you? Throw Rocks? \n \n There is a lot more that our Inalienable Bill of Rights protects, but I think you get the idea! There is ALWAYS someone who will do whatever they can to SCAM you out of your government, but especially your Rights! There will always be those who claim, You Never Really had the Right! That was just a figment of your imagination. They think that you need to belong to the Government of the United States. You are their subject! And if they are left to their devices, and allowed to continue their heresy, then they are Right! For if they are allowed the idea that they can amend the first 10 Inalienable Rights out of OUR Bill of Rights, in OUR of the Constitution! YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHTS! NONE AT ALL! \n \n   The Second Amendment strikes back  \n Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence Tribe says, \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\" Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \n\n Our Founders set up a system of checks and balances with the Executive branch, the judicial branch, and the legislative branch, all serving as a check on the other, and We the Armed People serve as the final check on it all! \n \n In the end, our Freedoms could certainly count on the protection of the 2nd Amendment!",

   "Well, at least you admit Article V exists now.\n \n government is \"pasting\" (assuming passing) laws!? Get out! Wait, didn't you just say they can pass laws per Article I? Now I assume you mean they are passing laws outside of their stated power. Good luck changing that. They have been doing it for over 100 years now and to remove the commerce clause you'd basically undo about 100 years worth of case law.\n \n Anyway, this is how that conversation went: I said \"you can repeal any amendment using Article V\" to which you basically responded that \"Article V is repealed\". Now you are telling me that you feel it is not being used when it should be? Are you not capable of replying to what I am stating? The fact that congress is \"abusing\" their power has nothing to do with whether or not you can repeal the 2nd amendment under Article V. If anything I'm arguing for the actual use of Article V anyway. Seems to me you are just covering your tracks after you realized you messed up.\n \n Under Article V you can...weren't you just saying we should use that article properly? I'd like to see a law ANYWHERE or an interpretation of Article V ANYWHERE that says otherwise. \n \n The Articles can be repealed and parts of them have been. What do you think an amendment is? \n \n Furthermore, the first 10 amendments were adopted USING ARTICLE V.\n \n ARTICLES in addition to, and Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America, proposed by Congress, and ratified by the Legislatures of the several States, pursuant to the fifth Article of the original Constitution.\n\n \n Uh, SOS, that was a response to your comment that the Articles were ratified according to Article VII. Two governments could not work at the same time and the court ruled that it couldn't go into effect with the 9th State and therefore had to wait until March 1789.\n \nARTICLE VII\n RATIFICATION\n The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same. \n \n In General \n \n In Owings v. Speed,1 the question at issue was whether the Constitution of the United States operated upon an act of Virginia passed in 1788. The Court held it did not, stating in part:\n \n \"The Conventions of nine States having adopted the Constitution, Congress, in September or October, 1788, passed a resolution in conformity with the opinions expressed by the Convention, and appointed the first Wednesday in March of the ensuing year as the day, and the then seat of Congress as the place, 'for commencing proceedings under the Constitution.'\n \n \"Both Governments could not be understood to exist at the same time. The New Government did not commence until the old Government expired. It is apparent that the Government did not commence on the Constitution being ratified by the ninth State; for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new Government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a Government until it dissolved on the 1st of November, by the successive disappearance of its Members. It existed potentially until the 2d of March, the day proceeding that on which the Members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\n \n \"The resolution of the Convention might originally have suggested a doubt, whether the Government could be in operation for every purpose before the choice of a President; but this doubt has been long solved, and were it otherwise, its discussion would be useless, since it is apparent that its operation did not commence before the first Wednesday in March 1789 . . . .\"\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Footnotes\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n 1 5 Wheat. (18 U.S.) 420, 422-423 (1820). \n\n \n One more point, you mention the ratification of following amendments and I countered with the martial law and reconstruction act. The process in Article V was suspended then, inoperative. It has been ignored and suspended before.\n \n I have one more. Article 27 which deals with the automatic pay raise for congress. Do tell how this fits into the ratification context of the Vth amendment.\n \n You are spewing stuff all over the board like a duck with diareahh. :)\n \n The main point, and the only point up for discussion is Randy Barnett's article in Volokh.

   "I suspected you were a dishonest poster and now you have proved it. I dare you to find ONE instance where I said I support removing one of the first 10 amendments. I'm merely arguing that you can. \n\n Well, OK. Thanks for clearing your opinion up with your sources. I have laid out the inverse with my sources. Now it is up to the readers of this forum! \n __________________________________________________________\n This is likely my last post on this subject, unless I find something constructive.\n \n A Republic is representative government ruled by law (the Constitution). A democracy is direct government ruled by the majority (mob rule). A Republic recognizes the inalienable rights of individuals while democracies are only concerned with group wants or needs (the public good).\n \n This is from one of Galileo's Liberal sites that he has posted from before, but it lays out both sides of this issue. Of course it is from a Liberal Prospective! However, it gives the reader a chance to see the difference of how our Founders laid things out, with Inalienable Rights, and how the Liberals want them to be. Now you can decide which camp you want to be in. Do you want to have a Republic, with Inalienable Rights, or do you want a Democracy with every right up for grabs and changeable, at any given in time? \n \n What do you want to leave for your children? \n \n   Rights are natural, inalienable, God-given and self-evident. \n Until a few hundred years ago, most political philosophers believed that rights were natural, inalienable, God-given and self-evident. Today, most philosophers agree that rights are social constructs, open to change. Conservatives and libertarians tend to favor the idea of natural rights; liberals the idea of social constructs.\n \n Let's first define rights, as asserted by many conservatives and libertarians:\n \n Inalienable rights: These are rights that cannot be taken away. .......\n Natural rights: These are rights that are supposedly universal in scope and binding on human behavior, much like the physical laws of nature. .....\n God-given rights: These are rights that originate from God.......\n Self-evident rights: These are rights that are supposedly so obvious that their nature and origin do not need to be defended by analysis.\n \n Liberals: Rights are social constructs. \n \n Summary\n \n Liberals believe that rights are social constructs, defended by force and open to change and improvement. Rights cannot be natural, like laws of nature, because nature enforces its laws absolutely, whereas rights are frequently broken. Rights cannot be inalienable, because governments frequently revoke rights. They cannot be God-given, because God originally blessed the rights of monarchy, genocide, polygamy, parental killing of disrespectful children, and other rights no one seriously defends today. Rights cannot be self-evident, because philosophers have been vigorously arguing over them for thousands of years.\n",

So what difference does it make when the President says that he or she does not like a particular proposed amendment, and they will not support it? None. At least, not technically.\n \n Now, obviously, the world is not sterile, particularly in Washington. When a President expresses reservations or dislike of an amendment or proposed amendment, it is obvious that any President worth electing knows darn well that the Executive has no veto over any amendment. The process is left completely in the hands of the Congress and/or the States. However, the President, as presumed head of a political party, has power over those in the same party - or, if not power, at least some influence.\n \n Because two-thirds of both houses must pass an amendment, and two-thirds of both houses are required to overturn a presidential veto, the framers may have decided to leave the President out for the sake of brevity. However, since the arguments of the President for the veto could change some minds between the passage vote and the veto vote, it is more likely the Framers just felt that amendments were something best left to the states and the representatives of the states.\n \n Sounds to me that Bin Bama wants to make the calls along w/Pelosi and Clinton and his Czars kinda cut the middle man out.",

   "Ha, the first 10 AMENDMENTS are not amendments...even after being ratified, per the Bill of Rights, via Article V...the AMENDMENT process.\n\n \n You are one slow tick; even I didn't figure you were completely devoid of doing your own research from \"your site\" and stating the truth...unless you are entirely illiterate? If you read this closely, you will find Article V isn't the only means to change the Constitution. You are going to play heck by trying to change a duly incorporated right, the 2A.\n \n This is from you own damn source tveee which you failed to read but keep ignoring in favor of more spam and propaganda:\n \n\n Incorporation\n \n One of the greatest changes in the interpretation of the Constitution came with the passage of the 14th Amendment after the conclusion of the Civil War. It was designed to assist newly freed slaves in the transition to freedom and to protect them from acts of the Southern states, and also to overturn the decision in the Dred Scott case that ruled that persons of African descent could not be citizens of the United States even if they were born in the United States. The amendment was successful in this endeavor, legally, if not in reality.\n \n But this sentence had and continues to have long-lasting implications on the application of the Bill of Rights to the states:\n \n No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n The \"Due Process Clause\" has been interpreted as applying the Bill of Rights, which lists the rights (or privileges and immunities) of the citizens, to the states. Known as \"incorporation,\" the application of the Bill to the states did not come all at once, nor is incorporation complete. Even today, there are some parts of the Bill which have not been incorporated. The process began unsuccessfully in the late 1800's and continued unsuccessfully right up until the 1930's. In 1947, however, in Adamson v California (332 U.S. 46 [1947]), the Supreme Court began to accept the argument that the 14th Amendment requires the states to follow the protections of the Bill of Rights. Historians both agreed and disagreed with the Court's contention that the framers of the 14th Amendment intended incorporation since its passage ... but historians do not sit on the Court. Their opinions were less important than those of the Justices.\n The process of selectively incorporating the clauses of the Bill of Rights is agreed to have begun in Twining v. New Jersey (268 U.S. 652 [1925]) which contemplated the incorporation of some of the aspects of the 8th Amendment - not because they were a part of the Bill of Rights but because they seemed to be fundamental to the concept of due process. This process of incorporating parts of the Bill of Rights because of their connection to due process began to run in parallel with the selective incorporation doctrine, where parts of the Bill of Rights were ruled to be enforceable on the states by virtue of the 14th Amendments, whether or not due process applied.\n \n Thus in the early 1960's, the Establishment Clause, the right to counsel, the rights of free speech, assembly, and petition, and the right against unreasonable searches and seizures were quickly incorporated. Since the early 60's, almost every clause in the Bill of Rights has been incorporated (notable exceptions are the 2nd and 3rd Amendments, the grand jury indictment clause of the 5th Amendment, and the 7th Amendment).\n \n \n\n AND....NOW YOU CAN ADD THE 2nd to that incorporation ala MCDONDALD\n \n So, I will say again, you are going to use the 5th Article to ban exactly WHAT?\n \n \"The Amendment process\" from your source:\n Constitutional Amendments - The U.S. Constitution Online - USConstitution.net\n \n\n The Amendment Process\n \n There are essentially two ways spelled out in the Constitution for how to propose an amendment. One has never been used.\n \n The first method is for a bill to pass both houses of the legislature, by a two-thirds majority in each. Once the bill has passed both houses, it goes on to the states. This is the route taken by all current amendments. Because of some long outstanding amendments, such as the 27th, Congress will normally put a time limit (typically seven years) for the bill to be approved as an amendment (for example, see the 21st and 22nd).\n \n The second method prescribed is for a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States, and for that Convention to propose one or more amendments. These amendments are then sent to the states to be approved by three-fourths of the legislatures or conventions. This route has never been taken, and there is discussion in political science circles about just how such a convention would be convened, and what kind of changes it would bring about.\n \n Regardless of which of the two proposal routes is taken, the amendment must be ratified, or approved, by three-fourths of states. There are two ways to do this, too. The text of the amendment may specify whether the bill must be passed by the state legislatures or by a state convention. See the Ratification Convention Page for a discussion of the make up of a convention. Amendments are sent to the legislatures of the states by default. Only one amendment, the 21st, specified a convention. In any case, passage by the legislature or convention is by simple majority.\n \n The Constitution, then, spells out four paths for an amendment:\n \n Proposal by convention of states, ratification by state conventions (never used) \n Proposal by convention of states, ratification by state legislatures (never used) \n Proposal by Congress, ratification by state conventions (used once) \n Proposal by Congress, ratification by state legislatures (used all other times) \n It is interesting to note that at no point does the President have a role in the formal amendment process (though he would be free to make his opinion known). He cannot veto an amendment proposal, nor a ratification. This point is clear in Article 5, and was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v Virginia (3 US 378 [1798]):\n \n The negative of the President applies only to the ordinary cases of legislation: He has nothing to do with the proposition, or adoption, of amendments to the Constitution.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \"Informal Amendment\"\n \n Another way the Constitution's meaning is changed is often referred to as \"informal amendment.\" This phrase is a misnomer, because there is no way to informally amend the Constitution, only the formal way. However, the meaning of the Constitution, or the interpretation, can change over time.\n \n There are two main ways that the interpretation of the Constitution changes, and hence its meaning. The first is simply that circumstances can change. One prime example is the extension of the vote. In the times of the Constitutional Convention, the vote was often granted only to monied land holders. Over time, this changed and the vote was extended to more and more groups. Finally, the vote was extended to all males, then all persons 21 and older, and then to all persons 18 and older. The informal status quo became law, a part of the Constitution, because that was the direction the culture was headed. Another example is the political process that has evolved in the United States: political parties, and their trappings (such as primaries and conventions) are not mentioned or contemplated in the Constitution, but they are fundamental to our political system.\n \n The second major way the meaning of the Constitution changes is through the judiciary. As the ultimate arbiter of how the Constitution is interpreted, the judiciary wields more actual power than the Constitution alludes to. For example, before the Privacy Cases, it was perfectly constitutional for a state to forbid married couples from using contraception; for a state to forbid blacks and whites to marry; to abolish abortion. Because of judicial changes in the interpretation of the Constitution, the nation's outlook on these issues changed.\n \n In neither of these cases was the Constitution changed. Rather, the way we looked at the Constitution changed, and these changes had a far-reaching effect. These changes in meaning are significant because they can happen by a simple judge's ruling and they are not a part of the Constitution and so they can be changed later.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Popular Amendment\n \n One other way of amendment is also not mentioned in the Constitution, and, because it has never been used, is lost on many students of the Constitution. Framer James Wilson, however, endorsed popular amendment, and the topic is examined at some length in Akhil Reed Amar's book, The Constitution: A Biography.\n \n The notion of popular amendment comes from the conceptual framework of the Constitution. Its power derives from the people; it was adopted by the people; it functions at the behest of and for the benefit of the people. Given all this, if the people, as a whole, somehow demanded a change to the Constitution, should not the people be allowed to make such a change? As Wilson noted in 1787, \"... the people may change the constitutions whenever and however they please. This is a right of which no positive institution can ever deprive them.\"\n \n It makes sense - if the people demand a change, it should be made. The change may not be the will of the Congress, nor of the states, so the two enumerated methods of amendment might not be practical, for they rely on these institutions. The real issue is not in the conceptual. It is a reality that if the people do not support the Constitution in its present form, it cannot survive. The real issue is in the practical. Since there is no process specified, what would the process be? There are no national elections today - even elections for the presidency are local. There is no precedent for a national referendum. It is easy to say that the Constitution can be changed by the people in any way the people wish. Actually making the change is another story altogether.\n \n Suffice it to say, for now, that the notion of popular amendment makes perfect sense in the constitutional framework, even though the details of effecting popular amendment could be impossible to resolve.\n \n \n\n \n NOTICE THIS WOULD WORK BETTER FOR GUN RIGHTS FOLKS THAN YOU GUN GRABBERS. See any mention of Article V?\n \n Again, from your source:\n Notes on the Amendments - The U.S. Constitution Online - USConstitution.net\n Notes on the Amendments - The U.S. Constitution Online - USConstitution.net\n \n \n\n The Bill of Rights (Amendments 1 through 10)\n As noted on the Constitutional Convention Topic Page, several delegates to the convention refused to sign the newly drafted constitution because it did not include a bill of rights. Bills of rights were typically parts of the constitutions of the several states of the day (and today), placed there to ensure that certain rights were recognized by the government. Most of the delegates did not feel such a bill was necessary, and other may have been on the fence but were weary from the months of negotiations.\n \n The lack of a bill of rights was one of the main arguments that Anti-Federalists used to try to convince the public to reject the Constitution. But the need for change was all too evident, and it was not rejected. However, some of the states sent suggestions for amendments to the Constitution to add an enumeration of certain rights. The ratification messages of the states included many varying suggestions, which the very first Congress took under consideration in its very first session.\n \n Representative James Madison, who was so instrumental in the creation of the Constitution in the first place, drafted a bill of rights. Though he originally opposed the idea, by the time he ran for a seat in the House, he used the creation of a bill as part of his campaign. He introduced the bill into the House, which debated it at length and approved 17 articles of amendment. The Senate took up the bill and reduced the number to 12, by combining some and rejecting others. The House accepted the Senate's changes, voting on September 24th and 25th, 1789; twelve articles of amendment were sent to the states for ratification.\n \n The first two articles were not accepted by enough states, but the last ten were. We know them today as Amendments 1 through 10. The second article was eventually ratified as the 27th Amendment. The first ten amendments, collectively known as the Bill of Rights, were ratified on December 15, 1791 (811 days). A photographic image of the badly-faded original Bill is available on this site.*\n \n\n * Get that, all 10 of the first amendments were adopted together as the Bill of Rights. The 2A was adopted along with 9 others unlike any other amendment and the document for which there is a picture and preamble on the site lists them as \"THE BILL OF RIGHTS\"\n \n lOOKS LIKE YOUR 5TH ARTICLE HASN'T BEEN RATIFIED :) BY YOUR WAY TO THINKING.\n \n Again, from your own source:\n \n14th Amendment\n The ratification of the 13th Amendment was a major victory for the North, and it was hoped that with the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment, the effects of slavery in the United States would quickly diminish. The original plan to readmit states after acceptance of the 13th was supported by President Andrew Johnson, but the Radical Republicans, as they became known, wanted more than just a return to normalcy. They wanted to keep the power they had attained during the war years. The South did not make it easy for Johnson, however, and the so-called Black Codes started to be passed in Southern states. Congressional inquiries into the Black Codes found them to be a new way of controlling ex-slaves, fraught with violence and cruelty.\n \n The ensuing Reconstruction Acts placed the former CSA states under military rule, and prohibited their congressmen's readmittance to Congress until after several steps had been taken, including the approval of the 14th Amendment. The 14th was designed to ensure that all former slaves were granted automatic United States citizenship, and that they would have all the rights and privileges as any other citizen. The amendment passed Congress on June 13, 1866, and was ratified on July 9, 1868 (757 days).\n",

I'm not sure how anything you say here refutes the idea that you can amend any part of the constitution as we have 27 times.\n\n \n Which in no way answers the question I asked you...to wit...name me one Fundamental Right in the BOR that has been amended after incorporation or before for that matter.\n \n \nThey provide proof the 2nd amendment is important but not a thing about not being able to repeal it.\n\n \n The Preamble Says IT:\n Amendments 1-10\n \n of the\n \n United States Constitution \n \n The Conventions of a number of the States having, at the time of adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added, and as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution; \n \n Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, two-thirds of both Houses concurring, that the following articles be proposed to the Legislatures of the several States, as amendments to the Constitution of the United States; all or any of which articles, when ratified by three-fourths of the said Legislatures, to be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the said Constitution, namely:\n \n \n [QUOTENo I don't. You have to show how Article V doesn't apply. It really is that simple.[/QUOTE]\n \n No I don't, you made the claim it is yours to defend, not mine. If you can't prove your claim you shouldn't be makeing one. That comes from the unprofound head of tveeees active imagination. You made the claim the 2A could be repealed even after it was incorporated yet you have no proof. You are a poor man/child indeed.\n \n I just did for the third time! Your other link cut against your claim too. :) Those BOR were articles as you can see in bold size 5. If so, your precious Article 5 can be amended too. Hence my comment which you have bandied about by your failure to understand the Preamble of the BOR and the purpose of it was to become a part of the Constitution which would never have been adopted without the BOR. Loser! The FF knew all too well the importance of a limited government and the danger of an Oligarchy, Monarchy and Tyranny.",

Still nothing to negate this.\n\n \n NO? Let's see what a well known Constitutional Scholar unlike Saul Cornell has to say about the matter:\n \n steeeeeeve is going to write exactly what from the BOR?\n \n THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT\n \n \n\n [Page 1241]\n \n It has become commonplace to remark upon Lincoln's blending of religious and constitutional rhetoric-in his Inaugural and Gettysburg Addresses, for example-but Bingham's imagery also bears notice. For him the Bill was not simply \"immortal,\" [215] as he preached in his maiden sermon in support of his Amendment, but \"sacred,\" a word that punctuates his most extended meditation on the Bill:\n \n As a further security for the enforcement of the Constitution, and especially of this sacred bill of rights, to all the citizens and all the people of the United States, it is further provided that the members of the several State Legislatures and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution. The oath, the most solemn compact which man can make with his Maker, was to bind the State Legislatures, executive officers, and judges to sacredly respect the Constitution and all the rights secured by it.... [The Bill of Rights encompasses] all the sacred rights of person-those rights dear to freemen and formidable only to tyrants- and of which the fathers of the Republic spoke, after God had given them the victory .... [216]\n \n Bingham waxed on at length proclaiming the need for \"fidelity to the sacred cause of the Constitution,\" describing the Founders' Bill as \"essential provisions of your Constitution, divine in their justice, sublime in their humanity,\" invoking \"God\" countless times, and in fact closing with a reference to \"the imperishable attribute of the God of nations.\" [217] Given all this iconography, the suggestion that some provisions of the Founders' Decalogue were dispensable would be as jarring (heretical is the le mot juste) as the claim that some of the Ten Commandments really were not, well, fundamental.\n \n Fairman was remarkably insensitive to all of this and indeed, quite anachronistic. Because he, in 1949, deemed various parts of the Bill to be optional or outdated, he tended to attribute similar views to the 1866 Congress: When Bingham said \"bill of rights\" he couldn't have meant it; his rhetoric showed sloppy thinking rather than a worldview to be taken seriously; silence on the other side must have meant that Bingham and company had not been understood; for surely some sane lawyer would otherwise have clearly spoken out against such silliness; and so on. Hugo Black, not Charles Fairman, proved the more faithful historian, for he understood-because he shared-the almost mystical attachment to the Bill of Rights exemplified by John Bingham. The title of Black's Carpentier Lectures on incorporation (among other things) says it all, and quite self-consciously: \"A Constitutional Faith.\" [218] (SNIP)\n \n (CONTINUED)\n \n The Bill thus stood as a handy pledge of the good faith of the South, enforceable by congressional refusal to readmit states that continued to violate its provisions. On the very day Bingham preached his most extended sermon on the Bill in the House, Senator James Nye proclaimed that Congress had \"no power to invade\" privileges of the Bill such as \"freedom of speech,\" \"freedom of the press,\" \"freedom in the exercise of religion,\" and the \"security of person,\" but that Congress did have power to \"restrain the respective States from infracting them\" by continuing to exclude as unrepublican any state violating these \"personal rights.\" [220] Representative Roswell Hart agreed several weeks later, defining a \"republican\" government as one where:\n \n \"citizens shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of other citizens;\" where \"no law shall be made prohibiting the free exercise of religion; where \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed;\" where \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,\" and where \"no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\" [221]\n \n [Page 1243]\n \n In a similar vein, Congressman Samuel Moulton argued against readmittance of various Southern states because \"there is neither freedom of speech, of the press, or protection to life, liberty, or property,\" and Representative Sidney Clarke opposed restoration of Mississippi to Congress because its constitutional provision disarming blacks violated the Second Amendment command that \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" [222] (SNIP]\n \n (CONTINUED)\n \n [Page 1256]\n \n When we turn instead to what important decisionmakers actually did say when they focused on the relationship between the Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill, we find powerful confirmation of incorporation. Over and over in the years between 1868 and 1873, various members of Congress, both Democrat and Republican, suggested that the Bill of Rights defined paradigmatic privileges and immunities of Americans that no state could abridge and that Congress could protect by legislation under Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment. This was no idle chatter, for Congress in fact legislated on the basis of this understanding. [271]\n \n Perhaps the most illuminating case arising under this congressional legislation was the 1871 circuit court case, United States v. Hall. In the course of deciding whether Congress had power to legislate under Section Five, Judge (later Justice) William Woods had to confront the words of Section One. His conclusion plainly supported incorporation: \"We think, therefore, that the ... rights enumerated in the first eight articles of amendment to the constitution of the United States are the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States.\" [272] But it is Woods' reasoning that is most illuminating. Like Rawle, Lumpkin, Shaw, Howard, Wilson, and many others, Woods treated rights declared in the Constitution as ipso facto fundamental, following the classic methodology of finding the common law:\n \n What are the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States here referred to [in Section One]? They are undoubtedly those which may be denominated fundamental; which belong of right to the citizens of all free states, and which have at all times been enjoyed by citizens of the several states which compose this Union .... Corfield v. Coryell. Among these we are safe in including those which in the constitution are expressly secured to the people, either as against the action of the federal or state governments. [273]\n \n \n\n \n Now steeeeve, explain again exactly how a State Convention to recall an amendment in the BOR and duly incorporated in the XIVth Amendment can be legislated on by States that are strictly prohibited from making any law to which they have no power and are forbidden to infringe on the RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE through any form of Article V to take away those rights or to infringe on them by repeal using any form of Article V or lawmaking process when they are justly bound by oath not to do. That would be totalitarian and give the people the just right to rebel and use any force necessary.\n \n Your arguement that a majority can force them to do so would make you entirely and completely beyond the law and any protections you denouce. Fair game is fair game.",

   "Bryan", 
   "Alright I've been away for a while. Here is where I stand on the question of the RKBA and repeal of the 2nd. Amendment. I believe the following:\n \n The RKBA pre-existed the Constitution.\n \n Nothing within Articles I-VII of the Constitution gave the federal government power to abolish the RKBA. \n \n The RKBA did not change, was not repealed, nor was it in any way diminished when the Constitution became binding on June 21, 1788.\n \n Both Federalists and Anti-federalists agreed that the Constitution did not grant Congress the power to abolish the many pre-existing rights of individuals, including free speech, press, freedom of religion, the individual RKBA, etc.\n \n The Bill of Rights was intended to enshrine recognition of fundamental rights to prevent later generations from incorrectly assuming that Congress had the power to deny them. \n \n The pre-existing RKBA is one of those rights and it is recognized in the 2nd. Amendment.\n \n The 2nd. Amendment, like all others, could be repealed by the Amendment process listed in Article V. Now don't misunderstand me. I do not want this to happen or to even be attempted. I think such a move would jeopardize the social contract that forms the basis for the Constitution. But, I still think the Constitution as written permits fools to attempt this. \n \n With this in mind, the focus of some anti-gun individuals and groups is to assume that we have no individual rights unless they are specifically \"granted\" to us in the Constitution. \n \n The above statement is-in addition to being incorrect-a dangerous and short-sighted view of liberty, but it is necessary to the anti-gun goal of arguing that the legitimacy of the individual RKBA rests entirely on the existence of the 2nd. Amendment (and its current SCOTUS interpretation). \n \n This is an anti-gun argument precisely because-if accepted-it makes the individual RKBA entirely dependent on the 2nd. Amendment, and therefore repealing the 2nd Amendment (or redefining it by court process) would entirely abolish the individual RKBA. I reject this argument. \n \n History has shown that people find it very easy to give away the rights of others, particularly if they feel they can gain something in return. Some anti-gunners reject the individual RKBA. They believe that only the despised gunny feels he should have the right, and because they have never laid a claim to it they find it easy to give it away in exchange for the false belief that they have thereby granted to themselves greater peace and security. \n \n No fundamental individual right has ever before had its official recognition stripped from the Constitution by having an amendment repealed. Just because a thing is remotely possible does not mean that it should be done or even be attempted (but if memory serves I believe legislation has been offered in the past to repeal the 2nd. Amendment). Again, although I recognize it is constitutionally possible to do so, I am absolutely opposed to any effort to repeal the 2nd. Amendment. \n \n Attempting to remove recognition of the individual RKBA by repealing the 2nd. Amendment through Article V would be a direct assault on the social contract that forms the justification for empowering a government to rule over us-that it must promise to do so while respecting individual liberty. It would also endanger all other rights by encouraging others to use the same process to attack individual rights they don't like. \n \n Most anti-gunners realize they can never secure the necessary support to repeal the 2nd. Amendment by either of the alternative processes set out in Article V.\n \n Lacking that ability, some anti-gunners know the best alternative is to try and secure five or more SCOTUS votes to give them what they know they cannot achieve at the ballot box-a judicial repeal of 2nd. Amendment recognition of the individual RKBA.\n \n Unlike some anti-gunners, I have a problem with asking SCOTUS to turn on and off the flow of fundamental rights like tap water. \n \n Asking SCOTUS to in effect say \"my bad, we really didn't mean that\" and take away its recognition of a fundamental right is even more dangerous than encouraging an Article V repeal of the 2nd. Amendment. At least with the Article V process the people have some control over the outcome. It is far more dangerous to encourage the lifetime appointees of SCOTUS to assume the power of acting like a nine-headed Caesar and go from a collective thumbs up to thumbs down on the RKBA under the mistaken belief that they would never assume the same arbitrary power when rights like free speech and press enter the arena. \n \n But some anti-gunners truly believe that SCOTUS should assume this power over the 2nd. Amendment so that it might (in their view) abolish the RKBA. I absolutely oppose this dangerous ends justifies the means argument. \n \n I also believe the 2nd. Amendment did not create the individual RKBA, it merely recognized it.\n \n Therefore, repealing the 2nd. Amendment or judicially altering its interpretation would not take away the individual RKBA, it would only remove official recognition of the right.\n \n In such a circumstance the 9th. Amendment (along with the 10th) would still secure to the people the pre-existing individual RKBA as surely as the 2nd. does now. This is my view of the matter, and one I can support with historical argument. However, I do not trust others in power to share this belief if the 2nd. Amendment were either repealed or judicially divorced from the individual RKBA-and for this reason I strongly oppose all attempts to repeal or judicially gut the 2nd. Amendment recognition of the individual RKBA.\n \n In my opinion, the only lawful and constitutional (but I still say immoral) way to take away the individual RKBA from the people is by convincing the people to use Article V to: 1. Repeal the 2nd Amendment, 2. Repeal the 9th. Amendment, 3. Repeal the 10th. Amendment, and 4. Amend Article I Sec. 8 to grant Congress specific power over individual arms. If and only then would I agree that my government's constitution had extinguished the individual RKBA, and the argument would then turn to whether or not a government could legitimately claim the right to rule over me while denying to me a right it had earlier considered to be fundamental.\n \n I view Steeeeve's argument about the constitutionality of repealing the 2nd. Amendment by the Article V amendment process as less a desire to do so and more of a warning to gun rights supporters that such a course is theoretically possible and therefore desired by some anti-gunners. \n \n I don't really have a problem with anyone saying it could be done-I accept it is theoretically possible to do that. But if someone says it should be done-well then I got issues with that.",

But even though I recognize that the process for possibly repealing an Amendment in the Bill of Rights exists, I still feel that this doesn't mean it's possible, simply because no politician would be suicidal enough to permanently end their career by even proposing such a vote. The political fallout that could happen would be incomprehensible.\n \n The distrust of politicians in Washington is thick enough one can easily cut it with a knife. If anybody dared propose altering the Constitution in a manner to remove the official recognition of any rights held within the Bill of Rights, I have no doubt that there would be another Civil War in this country, with every single state choosing to secede from the union and exempt itself from government regulation.",

This, of course, is totally dependent on everything else in the constitution being interpreted correctly (which is currently isn't) including the 14th amendment. \n \n Anyway, the point still remains that you can repeal the second amendment.\n\n \n First let me say that as I think about this I see the potential for irony here. For years some people have argued the 2nd. Amendment never recognized an individual RKBA&#8212;that it was all about &#8220;state&#8217;s rights to militias&#8221; or such nonsense. Now I bet these same people are willing to accept that it does recognize the individual RKBA because (a) the don&#8217;t have five SCOTUS votes to say otherwise yet, and (b) it now gives them a real target to focus upon. That is, they will agree now that the RKBA is protected by the 2nd. Amendment, and then try to kill the right by repealing the Amendment. Sort of like giving the elusive RKBA a body to rest in for the purpose of killing that body and thereby destroying the right&#8212;whereas before Heller and McDonald their argument would mean a repeal of the Amendment had no effect on the RKBA because, in their earlier view, the 2nd. had nothing to do at all with an individual RKBA. \n \n But to answer you, Steeeve, \n \n I believe the RKBA is a natural right that was recognized long before the Constitution was adopted. Our ancestors made specific claims to the free exercise of that right during the revolutionary war period and long before the Constitution was adopted. If you could repeal the 2nd. Amendment then you would have done nothing more than remove the RKBA as a specifically enumerated right&#8212;but you have not abolished the right, only the enumerated recognition of the right. This is where the 9th. Amendment in particular comes into play:\n \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n \n See also the following SCOTUS explanation of the 9th. Amendment:\n \n Madison's comments in Congress also reveal the perceived need for some sort of constitutional &#8220;saving clause,&#8221; which, among other things, would serve to foreclose application to the Bill of Rights of the maxim that the affirmation of particular rights implies a negation of those not expressly defined. See 1 Annals of Cong. 438-440 (1789). See also, e.g., 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 651 (5th ed. 1891). Madison's efforts, culminating in the Ninth Amendment, served to allay the fears of those who were concerned that expressing certain guarantees could be read as excluding others.\n \n Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 581 (1980) (footnote 15)\n \n The clear principle here is that individual rights do not end at the 8th. Amendment, and that all natural rights not listed are still protected. In fact, the principle requires that the Constitution is to be construed to recognize that these rights not only exist independently of the Constitution but are also always reserved to the people. Under this principle the repeal of the 2nd. Amendment does nothing other than convert the RKBA from enumerated to unenumerated status. To lose the right entirely would require a further repeal of the legal principle in the 9th. (and the related principle that powers are retained by the people in the 10th ). That further step is required to show that we are also surrendering those unenumerated rights like the RKBA (which would also jeopardize other unenumerated rights like, for example, abortion, contraception, etc. that all rely upon an unenumerated general right of privacy).\n \n As an aside, I would note that judges have historically been loath to delve too deeply into the 9th. Amendment because there are few if any guideposts to tell us what unenumerated rights exist, and the temptation to legislate from the bench is very great (I&#8217;ll say the 9th. protects this right because I like this one, but I&#8217;ll say that one does not fit in the 9th. because I don&#8217;t personally like that one&#8212;which in retrospect is very much like Souter&#8217;s proposed &#8220;interest balancing&#8221; test for the 2nd. Amendment in Heller that allows the RKBA to exist only so long a judge personally thinks it should be allowed to do so). (correction: The proposed test was offered by Breyer while Souter joined Breyer's opinion) \n \n Finally, if you did repeal the 2nd., 9th., and 10th. amendments, then the long standing federalist principle of government being limited to its enumerated powers dictates that Congress still has no power over individual arms unless the Constitution specifically grants it&#8212;which would IMO still require further amendment to grant Congress specific Article I sec. 8 power over individual arms.\n \n And, the more I think about it, you would also have to consider modifying the due process clause in the 5th and 14th. Amendments. Oh, I know it says &#8220;process&#8221; while SCOTUS says it really means &#8220;substantive&#8221; rights. But now SCOTUS has said the individual RKBA is a fundamental right which due process requires the federal and state governments to recognize. Even if you abolish the 2nd, 9th, and 10th amendments, and even if you thereby claim that no right exists outside those enumerated in the BoR, you still have to deal with the SCOTUS interpretation of including the RKBA as one deserving 5th/14th due process protection. \n \n And here you would find even Justice Stevens giving support for the belief that an unenumerated right can still be protected by 5th/14th amendment &#8220;due process&#8221; clause:\n \n [I]It follows that the term &#8220;incorporation,&#8221; like the term &#8220;unenumerated rights,&#8221; is something of a misnomer. [Slip Op. 8] Whether an asserted substantive due process interest is explicitly named in one of the first eight Amendments to the Constitution or is not mentioned, the underlying inquiry is the same: We must ask whether the interest is &#8220;comprised within the term liberty.&#8221; Whitney, 274 U.S., at 373 (Brandeis, J., concurring). As the second Justice Harlan has shown, ever since the Court began considering the applicability of the Bill of Rights to the States, &#8220;the Court's usual approach has been to ground the prohibitions against state action squarely on due process, without intermediate reliance on any of the first eight Amendments.&#8221; Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 24 (1964) (dissenting opinion); see also Frankfurter, Memorandum on &#8220;Incorporation&#8221; of the Bill of Rights into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, 78 Harv. L. Rev. 746, 747-750 (1965). In the pathmarking case of Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 666 (1925), for example, both the majority and dissent evaluated petitioner's free speech claim not under the First Amendment but as an aspect of &#8220;the fundamental personal rights and &#8216;liberties&#8217; protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States.&#8221;9 [Slip Op. 9]\n \n In his own classic opinion in Griswold, 381 U.S., at 500 (concurring in judgment), Justice Harlan memorably distilled these precedents' lesson: &#8220;While the relevant inquiry may be aided by resort to one or more of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, it is not dependent on them or any of their radiations. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands . . . on its own bottom.&#8221;10 Inclusion in the Bill of Rights is neither necessary nor sufficient for an interest to be judicially enforceable under the Fourteenth Amendment.[/I]\n \n McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, 7-9 (2010) (bold emphasis at the end added by me)\n \n But if you could somehow overcome all of this and also exclude the RKBA from due process protection, then at this point I would agree that the RKBA had been entirely abolished. So, I would argue, would be the social contract upon which the Constitution was based&#8212;that of requiring a government to respect individual liberty. You would in effect burn down the house to smoke out the bugs you wanted to get rid of.\n \n Bear in mind, Steeeeve, that I am not suggesting you would want to do any of this. To be fair to you I have not seen you suggest as much, at least not yet. I just don&#8217;t want anyone else to take my admission that it is theoretically possible to repeal the 2nd. Amendment to mean that they could then declare the RKBA dead. \n \n ---\n \n Roper: So now you'd give the Devil benefit of law!\n More: Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?\n Roper: I'd cut down every law in England to do that!\n More: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you &#8212; where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast &#8212; man's laws, not God's &#8212; and if you cut them down &#8212; and you're just the man to do it &#8212; d'you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake.

According to the RCMP website, the police can access the registry from their cars when they stop a vehicle or before visiting a residence:\n \n \"The registration of all firearms (restricted and non-restricted) is very important to law enforcement officials when they evaluate a potential threat to safety and the possible removal of firearms from an individual. Police officers can access CFRO from their vehicle, giving them more information when conducting a preliminary situational risk-assessment. Without a firearms registry, when police are called to a residence or stop a vehicle, they would have to take the word of the occupant whether firearms are present or have been surrendered.\n \n \"Increasing owner accountability\n \n \"The Firearms Act prohibits individuals from selling firearms to those who are not eligible. Under the CFP&#8217;s management, registration must be transferred to the new owner and during the transfer process a computerized public safety check on the new owner makes sure that there are no reasons why they should not have firearms.

   "What do you mean that the registry can't be used until after a crime has been committed?\n\n \n Just what I said. The registry is useless until after a crime has been committed, and the police actually have a recovered firearm to test. Until then you have this great big huge massive list that's hardly complete, contains numerous errors, and has cost $2 billion in taxpayer money.\n \n \nAccording to the RCMP website, the police can access the registry from their cars when they stop a vehicle or before visiting a residence:\n\n \n Firstly, why would the officers need to check a long gun registry when committing a traffic stop?\n \n Secondly, not seeing a residence listed gives a false sense of security. If somebody is in illegal possession of an unregistered rifle or shotgun the police are walking into a potential death trap. Meanwhile the police in America treat absolutely every situation as if there are guns in the house until they secure the scene, sweep the scene, and confirm beyond doubt that there are no weapons present. That's how it's supposed to be done, that's how it works best.\n \n Relying on the long gun registry to tell if the person you're questioning is unarmed is like believing in the honor system; it only works as long as people don't lie. And once somebody lies the system becomes useless and somebody's gonna die.\n \n \n\"The registration of all firearms (restricted and non-restricted) is very important to law enforcement officials when they evaluate a potential threat to safety and the possible removal of firearms from an individual. Police officers can access CFRO from their vehicle, giving them more information when conducting a preliminary situational risk-assessment. Without a firearms registry, when police are called to a residence or stop a vehicle, they would have to take the word of the occupant whether firearms are present or have been surrendered.\n\n \n The approach of the American police force works much better. Always treat the situation as if the suspect is potentially armed.\n \n \n\"Universal firearms registration in CFIS allows for the positive identification of legitimate firearms.\n\n \n Unless the serial number has been obliterated. Then all the registration in the world won't help you. All information is gone, never to be retrieved, and you can't tell which end is up.\n \n \nWhen checking CFRO during a traffic stop or at a crime scene, the fact that a firearm is not registered will alert the police to the possibility that it may have been stolen, illegally imported, illegally manufactured, or illegally acquired. Illegal firearms can be identified and linked to other firearms and to crimes and criminals. Both restricted and non-restricted firearms are used by criminals, so registration of all firearms supports police investigations.\n\n \n You make it sound like Canada has a serious crime problem going on. Could it be that gun control truly doesn't equal crime control?\n \n \n\"Registration helps police trace firearms and combat the illegal movement of firearms\n\n \n And how do you compel criminals to register their illegally possessed firearms?\n \n \n\"To break up organized networks involved in the illegal movement of firearms, it is necessary to have a traceable commodity. Previously, police had to search manually through thousands of retail records to find the source of any non-restricted firearms recovered at crime scenes. The computerized, centralized CFIS makes it much easier for police to trace and locate the last known owner of these firearms.\n\n \n In America we don't pass a law simply because it makes things more convenient for the police. Nor should we. Proposing we do such is advocating a police state.",

   "I found the report. It contains some examples of how the registry has been helpful. It has helped the police seize guns from dangerous people and recover stolen weapons:\n \n \"After an individual was observed driving directly into some parked vehicles, he was taken into an ambulance to be checked out. He subsequently pulled out a handgun, pointed it at the attendants and threatened to kill them if they touched him. He then exited the ambulance and fled on foot. The local police soon apprehended him and found that he was in possession of a Glock pistol and loaded spare magazines. Canadian Firearms Registration online (CFRO) checks indicated that he was a licensed owner of 31 registered firearms. NWEST was asked to assist by preparing the public safety warrant, laying charges and seizing 33 firearms (two of which were not registered), along with thousands of rounds of ammunition.....\n \n \"Information from a concerned citizen indicated a web page where young males were posing with numerous firearms (handguns and long guns) while at the same time drinking and partying. From comments made on the site it was determined the residence was in Gander, NL. Local law enforcement was able to identify one of the males noted in the web page as well as his residence. The firearm Registry was able to confirm that a male living at that residence, believed to be the father, had a collection of restricted, prohibited and non-restricted firearms, twenty in all. A check of these firearms provided by the registry confirmed they were the same type noted in the photos on the WebPages. RCMP officers were able to obtain and successfully execute a Public Safety Search Warrant and seize all 19 firearms....\n \n \"Provide support to RCMP Detachment in Alberta after a suspect was stopped with 4 long guns in his vehicle. The suspect was evasive when questioned about the firearms leading investigators to believe that they had been stolen. NWEST conducted CFRO checks on the recovered firearms and determined that all 4 were registered to a local resident other than the person that was in possession of them. The registered owner, who was working out of town, was contacted by police and stated that as far as he was aware all of his firearms were safely stored at his residence. Police attended owners' residence and discovered evidence confirming that his residence had been broken into and that all 16 of his long guns had been stolen. Investigational follow up subsequently resulted in the recovery of the remaining 12 long guns from the suspect....\n \n \"I know of examples where the police removed guns from a local man who was depressed and another where the legislation prevented a psychotic woman with no past history of mental illness or criminal activity from obtaining guns. Both of these scenarios could easily have been tragedies involving several people, primarily their family members, had there not been mechanisms in place to deal with these situations. Unfortunately, none of these preventative activities makes the newspaper so people are not aware of how useful it is in practice. Had this type of system been in place in Virginia, it could very well have prevented the tragedy that just occurred there.\"\n http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/pubs/fire-feu-eval/eval-eng.pdf",

   "I believe the RKBA is a natural right that was recognized long before the Constitution was adopted. Our ancestors made specific claims to the free exercise of that right during the revolutionary war period and long before the Constitution was adopted. If you could repeal the 2nd. Amendment then you would have done nothing more than remove the RKBA as a specifically enumerated right-but you have not abolished the right, only the enumerated recognition of the right. This is where the 9th. Amendment in particular comes into play:\n \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n \n See also the following SCOTUS explanation of the 9th. Amendment:\n ....\n \n \n The clear principle here is that individual rights do not end at the 8th. Amendment, and that all natural rights not listed are still protected. In fact, the principle requires that the Constitution is to be construed to recognize that these rights not only exist independently of the Constitution but are also always reserved to the people. Under this principle the repeal of the 2nd. Amendment does nothing other than convert the RKBA from enumerated to unenumerated status. To lose the right entirely would require a further repeal of the legal principle in the 9th. (and the related principle that powers are retained by the people in the 10th ). That further step is required to show that we are also surrendering those unenumerated rights like the RKBA (which would also jeopardize other unenumerated rights like, for example, abortion, contraception, etc. that all rely upon an unenumerated general right of privacy).\nI still respectfully disagree with the concept that the RKBA would be protected by the 9th amendment. I'll address the \"due process\" argument by only saying I don't believe in substantive due process. I come from a standpoint of \"if the constitution is interpreted correctly\" and by this I mean substantive due process is gone and basic originalism wins out (See anything Bork, Scalia, or Thomas says for what I mean here). \n \n I've actually done some substantial reading on the 9th amendment in the past 3-4 years and have had many debates on this with folks in the \"gay rights\" forums since the argument came up that the 9th amendment protects marriage as a constitutional right. \n \n Most of my arguments are those of Kurt Lash who I have found to make the most convincing argument for the meaning of the 9th amendment. He often argues with Barnett (I think) on the meaning but I feel Lash takes a more conservative approach that is better grounded in the history and ideals at the time. The paper is linked below.\n SSRN-The Lost Original Meaning of the Ninth Amendment by Kurt Lash\n \n I would argue that both the 9th and 10th amendments are about federalism more than anything. \n the Ninth and Tenth Amendments originally were understood to represent dual limitations on the power of the federal government to interfere with the states\n\n And on natural rights:\n In light of this evidence, there is no textual reason and little historical reason to believe that the \"other rights\" of the Ninth Amendment did not include natural rights. But understanding that the Founders embraced natural rights is not the same thing as understanding the Founders' view of the Ninth Amendment. The story of the Ninth indicates that it served as a rule of construction protecting the autonomy of local government. The evidence in this regard is as broad and deep as evidence regarding natural rights.\n\n Mr Lash uses this example but take the 1st amendment establishment clause. Freedom of religion was without a doubt considered a natural right and probably still is. Yet the states were allowed to establish state religions and/or local religions. This was because the 1st amendment only limited the federal government and the 9th and 10th amendment gave the states the power to determine what natural rights they wanted to recognize. In other words they didn't want to leave natural rights to the whim of federal power INCLUDING the federal judges (to some extent...see below quote). They felt it was better with the states. So no limitation was ever placed on the states for natural rights. \n The rights referred to in the Ninth Amendment, natural or otherwise, were to be administered on a state by state basis. The administration of such rights was one of the reserved powers left to the states under the Tenth Amendment. As the New York Convention declared:[T]hat every Power, Jurisdiction and right, which is not by the said Constitution clearly delegated to the Congress of the United States, or the departments of the government thereof, remains to the People of the several States, or to their respective State Governments to whom they may have granted the same.\nUnder this reading of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, we would expect natural rights to be enforced by courts, both state and federal, as an aspect of state, not federal law. In fact, this is exactly what they did.\n \n\n I think it is fairly convincing that nature rights are left up to the state and local governments per the 9th and 10th amendments. The constitution is a very limited document. It makes sense to me that they wouldn't want to go there because it would bring that power back to the federal level (federal judges deciding what a natural right is based upon national law) which is what the founders were afraid of.",

   "Well let me see if I can better explain my position of how the 9th amendment protects the individual RKBA. \n \n I am not arguing that the 9th amendment creates any rights. Going back to my law school days of the early 90's, I remember Lawrence Tribe's con law textbook speaking of error when we try to say \"9th amendment rights\" for in his view that was not what the 9th amendment was about. The 9th does not create or grant any rights, it merely works to protect those already in existence. It does so by reminding us these unenumerated rights still exist and that Congress has no power to infringe upon them absent a specific grant of enumerated power in Article I sec. 8.\n \n The 9th is, in its most basic sense, a rule of how to read the federal constitution (and in particular congressional authority in Article I sec. 8)-that the federal government is a government of limited and specifically enumerated powers. On this point of powers limited by enumeration both federalists and anti-federalists agreed. But, as we all know anti-federalist thought did not trust in the security of this interpretation and desired a further recognition of enumerated individual rights. The issue federalists had with creating a Bill of Rights can be summarized this way: If you create a BoR and say the national government cannot infringe upon them you are in effect admitting that the constitution otherwise permitted the national government to do so-which in effect nullifies the doctrine of a government limited by enumerated powers. \n \n But as we all know we got an expressed BoR. This lead in turn to confrontation with the ancient common law maxim (still intact today) of \"expressio unius est exclusio alteriusm\", which is described here: \n \n \"expressio unius est exclusio alterius\" - i.e., the expression of one is the exclusion of others. United States v. Wells Fargo Bank, 485 U.S. 351, 357 (1988)\n \n the canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius does not apply to every statutory listing or grouping; it has force only when the items expressed are members of an \"associated group or series,\" justifying the inference that items not mentioned were excluded by deliberate choice, not inadvertence. Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 168 (2003)\n \n And so Madison is confronted with the issue of how to say things not included in the BoR were not excluded by deliberate choice-that right B is not declared extinct just because right A was included in the BoR and B was not-that this unenumerated remainder of individual rights is not only alive and well but is further not abandoned to the whim of congressional control. \n \n This is why SCOTUS said the following about the 9th:\n \n Madison's comments in Congress also reveal the perceived need for some sort of constitutional \"saving clause,\" which, among other things, would serve to foreclose application to the Bill of Rights of the maxim that the affirmation of particular rights implies a negation of those not expressly defined. See 1 Annals of Cong. 438-440 (1789). See also, e.g., 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 651 (5th ed. 1891). Madison's efforts, culminating in the Ninth Amendment, served to allay the fears of those who were concerned that expressing certain guarantees could be read as excluding others. Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 581 (1980) (footnote 15)\n \n Now the 10th Amendment has a similar function of limiting the federal government to its enumerated powers, and for this reason these two amendments are often conflated together because they work along parallel lines. But in SCOTUS use the 10th is (almost) always applied to issues of preserving state powers, while the 9th is absolutely always used to deal with issues of individual rights. \n \n The tension with the 9th today is how it is applied. The conservative wing of the court views it as a reminder of the principle that congressional authority is limited to enumerated powers. The liberal wing of SCOTUS has long sought to use the 9th as a tool of judicial empowerment-a blank slate upon which to recognize or even create rights and then enforce them upon the federal government and, by further declaring these newly court recognized rights to be 14th amendment due process \"fundamental rights\" enforcing them against the states. But both wings of the court agree that the 9th talks of pre-existing individual rights. \n \n You mention Scalia, and he is a good case study to look at. Scalia is a great believer in the remainder of unenumerated individual rights, and he even looks to the Declaration of Independence as justification for these natural rights. He also agrees that the 9th. Amendment should work to protect these rights. Scalia's issue with the 9th is his great reluctance to use his judicial authority to go trailblazing without clear guideposts in search of applying the 9th. to other unenumerated rights (something the liberal wing of the court is frequently willing to do). The following quote illustrates Scalia's position (from a case asking that a state law be struck down by recognizing and enforcing an unenumerated right of a parent to raise their children as they see fit): \n \n In my view, a right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children is among the \"unalienable Rights\" with which the Declaration of Independence proclaims \"all men . . . are endowed by their Creator.\" And in my view that right is also among the \"othe[r] [rights] retained by the people\" which the Ninth Amendment says the Constitution's enumeration of rights \"shall not be construed to deny or disparage.\" The Declaration of Independence, however, is not a legal prescription conferring powers upon the courts; and the Constitution's refusal to \"deny or disparage\" other rights is far removed from affirming any one of them, and even further removed from authorizing judges to identify what they might be, and to enforce the judges' list against laws duly enacted by the people. Consequently, while I would think it entirely compatible with the commitment to representative [Page 92] democracy set forth in the founding documents to argue, in legislative chambers or in electoral campaigns, that the State has no power to interfere with parents' authority over the rearing of their children, I do not believe that the power which the Constitution confers upon me as a judge entitles me to deny legal effect to laws that (in my view) infringe upon what is (in my view) that unenumerated right. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 91-92 (2000) (Scalia, dissenting)\n \n See also Scalia in Heller, where he touches briefly on the language of the 9th to show how the similar words \"the people\" in both the 2nd and the 9th mean rights of \"the people\" and not \"the states\":\n \n The unamended Constitution and the Bill of Rights use the phrase \"right of the people\" two other times, in the First Amendment's Assembly-and-Petition Clause and in the Fourth Amendment's Search-and-Seizure Clause. The Ninth Amendment uses very similar terminology (\"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people\"). All three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not \"collective\" rights, or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 5 (2008)\n \n Scalia clearly believes that the 9th. Amendment talks about individual rights. \n \n Having said this, however, I want to make plain that I believe the 9th is different from other amendments. Let me use a dog analogy. The other individual rights amendments identify particular rights and then build fences around them to keep Congress out. By default, these amendments assume Congress can still roam around the areas not fenced off. The 9th is not an amendment designed to build a massive fence around every other unenumerated right. (This is what the liberal wing of the Court wishes it to be-a fence that can be moved about at whim depending of the particular views of the judges on the bench that day.) It is rather the leash that ties Congress back to the limited powers expressed in Article I sec. 8-or to put it another way--\"just because we built a fence around these rights does not mean we agree you can slip your Article I Sec 8 leash.\" \n \n So when I read:\n \n \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people\"\n \n I translate it this way:\n \n Hey Congress, just because we set out certain rights and said you can't reach them does not mean you have the power to go after any we did not also mention-you're still tied to the limits of what Article I Sec. 8 allows.\n \n And this is how it protects the RKBA. If, for example, I wanted to join the Virginia National Guard and decided I wanted to bring along my hunting rifle, then the 9th Amendment does nothing to protect my desire to do so. Congress has specific Article I Sec. 8 power to arm the militias-and SCOTUS has held in the past that if Congress has the power granted to it then the 9th will not stop it from using it. But, if I wanted to go hunting and Congress decided to ban hunting or ban my private possession of my rifle, then the 9th would tell Congress that it has no power to do so because Article I Sec. 8 does not contain it. \n \n Now I agree that a byproduct of this right is the effect it can have on the power of the states. Ordinarily when the states and the federal government have laws regulating an area and the laws conflict the federal government wins by application of the supremacy clause. If the area is beyond Congress' enumerated powers, however, then the 9th Amendment (and the 10th) can invalidate the congressional legislation and leave the state laws untouched. That is because the BoR applies only to the states absent 14th Amendment incorporation, and the 9th has never been incorporated. For the state law to be in jeopardy then the area must be declared a \"fundamental right\" under the 14th Amendment's due process clause. \n \n This is where the liberal wing of the court reasserts itself. The phrase \"judicial activism\" generally means the liberal wing of the court using the 9th and 14th Amendments like blank parchment to write down new individual rights and then enforce them against the government. \n \n But even Scalia has abandoned resistance to the theory of \"substantive due process\" incorporation if the rights are already enumerated in the BoR: \n \n I am willing to accept the proposition that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, despite its textual limitation to procedure, incorporates certain substantive guarantees specified in the Bill of Rights; but I do not accept the proposition that it is the secret repository of all sorts of other, unenumerated, substantive rights.... TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U.S. 443, 470 (1993) (and yet despit this some poeple still wrongfully claim that Scalia had never embraced substantive due process until he found a right he wanted to incorporate in McDonald)\n \n And so you can see from this that while he had no problem using due process to reach and incorporate the enumerated RKBA in the 2nd. Amendment, Scalia would (and still does) generally draw the due process line at the boundary of the enumerated rights in the BoR. So now the question becomes what if the RKBA were removed from the BoR? The answer is not that simple....\n \n Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) that I cited earlier is an excellent example of how SCOTUS used 14th. Amendment \"substantive due process\" to find an unenumerated right and then enforce it against the states (in this case the state of Washington). The holding is the case is summarized thus:\n \n The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause has a substantive component that \"provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests,\" Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720, including parents' fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. Id. at 57\n \n This is by far not the only case in which SCOTUS uses the 14th. to find and enforce unenumerated rights against state infringement. And so there is ample SCOTUS precedent for using the 5th/14th due process clause to reach and protect unenumerated rights. \n \n Now consider again the RKBA. Established SCOTUS doctrine holds that the due process clause binds both the federal government and the states to not interfere with \"certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.\" Rights are fundamental because they are \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\" For the conservative wing of the court-accustomed to incorporation only with rights listed in the BoR--an unenumerated RKBA would be different from other unenumerated rights it has refused in the past to incorporate. Alito Scalia, Roberts, Kennedy, and Thomas have already agreed that the individual RKBA exists and that it is a fundamental right by the above definition. They have already voted to incorporate it against the states in McDonald (with Thomas being the only one to also try and revive the 14th. P&I clause). If Heller were overturned and the RKBA were stripped from the 2nd Amendment, then is there much doubt that Scalia, Alito, Thomas, Roberts, and Kennedy could not agree the 5th/14th due process clause would still include this \"recently unenumerated\" right which they have already declared to be fundamental? Does anyone think they would reject their earlier belief that the right is fundamental? Would they in effect say it's now \"un-fundamental\"? So even if the 2nd. were repealed or the RKBA stripped from it, the 5th/14th. due process clause would still protect the RKBA against both federal and state infringement so long as the fundamental right rationale these justices set forth in McDonald stands. Therefore, to get rid of the RKBA you also have to strip it of its fundamental right status. \n \n And this is where the liberal wing of the court finds itself on the horns of a dilemma. This wing, led by the retired Stevens, who appears to have passed the torch to Souter and Breyer, has made it clear that it wants to strip the individual RKBA out of the 2nd. Amendment and return it to unenumerated status. However, this is the same wing that has consistently used the 5th./14th due process clause to find and protect any number of similarly unenumerated rights. So assume they have their way, overturn Heller, and strip the RKBA out of the 2nd. Amendment. The right then becomes just another unenumerated right, like abortion, contraception, and others they have already used due process to recognize and protect. If these justices wish to be morally consistent with their own positions, then they must also accept that the 5th./14th. Amendment due process clause recognizes and protects the unenumerated RKBA-or come up with a convincing argument that it does not merit fundamental right status (which they tried and failed to do in McDonald).\n \n So to answer the argument about state infringement, I agree that the 9th. Amendment has never been incorporated against the states. I agree that before the 14th. Amendment the RKBA must look to the state constitutions alone for protection from state infringement. But, pursuant to 14th. amendment due process incorporation, other rights-including several unenumerated rights outside the BoR-have been recognized as \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\" and therefore within the protection of the due process clause and enforced against the states. The majority in McDonald has held the individual RKBA is just such a right, and because it is so then the states are now bound by the 14th amendment to respect it. If you want to have the states unbound by the requirement to respect the individual RKBA, then you must either undo McDonald or repeal the 14th. Amendment. \n \n The point I want to stress is whether or not you are a fan of substantive due process even Scalia recognizes that we have gone too far down that road to turn around. This doctrine interweaves all of these \"fundamental rights\" into one solid body of \"ordered liberty.\" It is easy to add to it where the right in question has such a clear historical importance (something I believe McDonald was right to conclude). It is very difficult, however, to pull one of these rights back without endangering the entire structure the Court has spent so long building. I may not be a great fan of substantive due process, but neither do I want judges playing Jenga with my rights-pulling one back out while hoping the entire tower does not come crashing down.",

It is rather the leash that ties Congress back to the limited powers expressed in Article I sec. 8-or to put it another way--\"just because we built a fence around these rights does not mean we agree you can slip your Article I Sec 8 leash.\" \n \n So when I read:\n \n \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people\"\n \n I translate it this way:\n \n Hey Congress, just because we set out certain rights and said you can't reach them does not mean you have the power to go after any we did not also mention-you're still tied to the limits of what Article I Sec. 8 allows.\n \n And this is how it protects the RKBA. If, for example, I wanted to join the Virginia National Guard and decided I wanted to bring along my hunting rifle, then the 9th Amendment does nothing to protect my desire to do so. Congress has specific Article I Sec. 8 power to arm the militias-and SCOTUS has held in the past that if Congress has the power granted to it then the 9th will not stop it from using it. But, if I wanted to go hunting and Congress decided to ban hunting or ban my private possession of my rifle, then the 9th would tell Congress that it has no power to do so because Article I Sec. 8 does not contain it. \n \n Now I agree that a byproduct of this right is the effect it can have on the power of the states. Ordinarily when the states and the federal government have laws regulating an area and the laws conflict the federal government wins by application of the supremacy clause. If the area is beyond Congress' enumerated powers, however, then the 9th Amendment (and the 10th) can invalidate the congressional legislation and leave the state laws untouched. That is because the BoR applies only to the states absent 14th Amendment incorporation, and the 9th has never been incorporated. For the state law to be in jeopardy then the area must be declared a \"fundamental right\" under the 14th Amendment's due process clause. \n \n This is where the liberal wing of the court reasserts itself. The phrase \"judicial activism\" generally means the liberal wing of the court using the 9th and 14th Amendments like blank parchment to write down new individual rights and then enforce them against the government. \n \n But even Scalia has abandoned resistance to the theory of \"substantive due process\" incorporation if the rights are already enumerated in the BoR: \n \n I am willing to accept the proposition that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, despite its textual limitation to procedure, incorporates certain substantive guarantees specified in the Bill of Rights; but I do not accept the proposition that it is the secret repository of all sorts of other, unenumerated, substantive rights.... TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U.S. 443, 470 (1993) (and yet despit this some poeple still wrongfully claim that Scalia had never embraced substantive due process until he found a right he wanted to incorporate in McDonald)\n \n And so you can see from this that while he had no problem using due process to reach and incorporate the enumerated RKBA in the 2nd. Amendment, Scalia would (and still does) generally draw the due process line at the boundary of the enumerated rights in the BoR. So now the question becomes what if the RKBA were removed from the BoR? The answer is not that simple....\n \n Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) that I cited earlier is an excellent example of how SCOTUS used 14th. Amendment \"substantive due process\" to find an unenumerated right and then enforce it against the states (in this case the state of Washington). The holding is the case is summarized thus:\n \n The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause has a substantive component that \"provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests,\" Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720, including parents' fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. Id. at 57\n \n This is by far not the only case in which SCOTUS uses the 14th. to find and enforce unenumerated rights against state infringement. And so there is ample SCOTUS precedent for using the 5th/14th due process clause to reach and protect unenumerated rights. \n \n Now consider again the RKBA. Established SCOTUS doctrine holds that the due process clause binds both the federal government and the states to not interfere with \"certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.\" Rights are fundamental because they are \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\" For the conservative wing of the court-accustomed to incorporation only with rights listed in the BoR--an unenumerated RKBA would be different from other unenumerated rights it has refused in the past to incorporate. Alito Scalia, Roberts, Kennedy, and Thomas have already agreed that the individual RKBA exists and that it is a fundamental right by the above definition. They have already voted to incorporate it against the states in McDonald (with Thomas being the only one to also try and revive the 14th. P&I clause). If Heller were overturned and the RKBA were stripped from the 2nd Amendment, then is there much doubt that Scalia, Alito, Thomas, Roberts, and Kennedy could not agree the 5th/14th due process clause would still include this \"recently unenumerated\" right which they have already declared to be fundamental? Does anyone think they would reject their earlier belief that the right is fundamental? Would they in effect say it's now \"un-fundamental\"? So even if the 2nd. were repealed or the RKBA stripped from it, the 5th/14th. due process clause would still protect the RKBA against both federal and state infringement so long as the fundamental right rationale these justices set forth in McDonald stands. Therefore, to get rid of the RKBA you also have to strip it of its fundamental right status. \n \n And this is where the liberal wing of the court finds itself on the horns of a dilemma. This wing, led by the retired Stevens, who appears to have passed the torch to Souter and Breyer, has made it clear that it wants to strip the individual RKBA out of the 2nd. Amendment and return it to unenumerated status. However, this is the same wing that has consistently used the 5th./14th due process clause to find and protect any number of similarly unenumerated rights. So assume they have their way, overturn Heller, and strip the RKBA out of the 2nd. Amendment. The right then becomes just another unenumerated right, like abortion, contraception, and others they have already used due process to recognize and protect. If these justices wish to be morally consistent with their own positions, then they must also accept that the 5th./14th. Amendment due process clause recognizes and protects the unenumerated RKBA-or come up with a convincing argument that it does not merit fundamental right status (which they tried and failed to do in McDonald).\n \n So to answer the argument about state infringement, I agree that the 9th. Amendment has never been incorporated against the states. I agree that before the 14th. Amendment the RKBA must look to the state constitutions alone for protection from state infringement. But, pursuant to 14th. amendment due process incorporation, other rights-including several unenumerated rights outside the BoR-have been recognized as \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\" and therefore within the protection of the due process clause and enforced against the states. The majority in McDonald has held the individual RKBA is just such a right, and because it is so then the states are now bound by the 14th amendment to respect it. If you want to have the states unbound by the requirement to respect the individual RKBA, then you must either undo McDonald or repeal the 14th. Amendment. \n \n The point I want to stress is whether or not you are a fan of substantive due process even Scalia recognizes that we have gone too far down that road to turn around. This doctrine interweaves all of these \"fundamental rights\" into one solid body of \"ordered liberty.\" It is easy to add to it where the right in question has such a clear historical importance (something I believe McDonald was right to conclude). It is very difficult, however, to pull one of these rights back without endangering the entire structure the Court has spent so long building. I may not be a great fan of substantive due process, but neither do I want judges playing Jenga with my rights-pulling one back out while hoping the entire tower does not come crashing down.\n\n \n Good post Bryan. I am reluctant to cover it up but pray that reposting it will re-inforce your well educated and additional look since this article I am posting was considered 60 plus years ago (1934 and 1968 then strongly attempted to be covered up until 1992 and seldom mentioned in the gun control debate today by those who would rather ignore it altogether as well as the XIVth) and has now become a prime factor once again as the antis try to find a way to end the Republican rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution that also guarantees a Republican form of government to each State despite dissenters like steeeeeeve who would deny, if he could that the inalienable rights are here to stay. At any rate, here is a bit of overlooked history :) by the ritilin and prozac generations.\n \n \n BEYOND THE SECOND AMENDMENT: AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO ARMS VIEWED THROUGH THE NINTH AMENDMENT\n \n The XIVth and the IXth are not recent concepts!

   "Well let me see if I can better explain my position of how the 9th amendment protects the individual RKBA. \nI think I misunderstood you (or visa versa) as I'll explain below.\n \n \nI am not arguing that the 9th amendment creates any rights. Going back to my law school days of the early 90's, I remember Lawrence Tribe's con law textbook speaking of error when we try to say \"9th amendment rights\" for in his view that was not what the 9th amendment was about. The 9th does not create or grant any rights, it merely works to protect those already in existence. It does so by reminding us these unenumerated rights still exist and that Congress has no power to infringe upon them absent a \n pecific grant of enumerated power in Article I sec. 8.\nI'd agree but would like to reinforce the idea that it is Congress (aka federal government) that cannot intrude. I'd actually go a bit further and say it was a restriction of federal judges as well.\n \nThe 9th is, in its most basic sense, a rule of how to read the federal constitution (and in particular congressional authority in Article I sec. 8)-that the federal government is a government of limited and specifically enumerated powers.\nIn other words, a federalism provision.\n \n \nNow the 10th Amendment has a similar function of limiting the federal government to its enumerated powers, and for this reason these two amendments are often conflated together because they work along parallel lines. But in SCOTUS use the 10th is (almost) always applied to issues of preserving state powers, while the 9th is absolutely always used to deal with issues of individual rights. \nThese amounts were once one. I stated earlier that they both deal with states rights. It seems obvious to me that the 9th implies other rights and the 10th says where those rights go. Naturally since the 10th talks about both state an individual rights than the 9th was also referring to these. This really is of no consequence though since either way the federal government is restricted.\n \n \nThe liberal wing of SCOTUS has long sought to use the 9th as a tool of judicial empowerment-a blank slate upon which to recognize or even create rights \nThis is kind of ironic when you think about it.\n \n \nHey Congress, just because we set out certain rights and said you can't reach them does not mean you have the power to go after any we did not also mention-you're still tied to the limits of what Article I Sec. 8 allows.\nWhich is where I misunderstood you. I thought you were saying the 9th amendment would protect the RKBA from state intrusion. This is, however, not at all what you were arguing\n \n \nBut even Scalia has abandoned resistance to the theory of \"substantive due process\" incorporation if the rights are already enumerated in the BoR: \nHe does not think it is correct, he just believes it would fracture too many rulings. Thomas, on the other hand, is more than willing to burn the entire jurisprudence of the last 100 years down. I probably am ok with that too. \n \n \nThis is by far not the only case in which SCOTUS uses the 14th. to find and enforce unenumerated rights against state infringement. And so there is ample SCOTUS precedent for using the 5th/14th due process clause to reach and protect unenumerated rights. \nWhich i feel is incorrect. \n \n \n If Heller were overturned and the RKBA were stripped from the 2nd Amendment, then is there much doubt that Scalia, Alito, Thomas, Roberts, and Kennedy could not agree the 5th/14th due process clause would still include this \"recently unenumerated\" right which they have already declared to be fundamental? Does anyone think they would reject their earlier belief that the right is fundamental?Would they in effect say it's now \"un-fundamental\"? \nWell, this has never been done but I would think they would understand the \"fundamental\" right is no long considered \"fundamental\" and thus would be gone. As for Thomas, I'm not sure he buys the whole \"fundamental\" thing anyway (whole-heartedly that is) but this is just from the few things I've read or heard from or on him. I'm of the opinion that \"fundamental\" rights are BS anyway. It is either a right or it isn't. You may have God given rights but that's the only difference I see. Moving on! \n \n \n So even if the 2nd. were repealed or the RKBA stripped from it, the 5th/14th. due process clause would still protect the RKBA against both federal and state infringement so long as the fundamental right rationale these justices set forth in McDonald stands. Therefore, to get rid of the RKBA you also have to strip it of its fundamental right status. \nYou are saying you'd have to remove the 14th amendment, not the 9th and 10th. I'd agree this is where we currently are but I'd say in fantasy land where the constitution means what it says than you shouldn't impose restrictions on the states via the due process clause. It just makes no sense. I'd also argue that the P&I clause doesn't impose those kind of \"thin air\" rights either. \n \n \nor come up with a convincing argument that it does not merit fundamental right status (which they tried and failed to do in McDonald).\nThe good thing about being a liberal justice is you can always string together a few quotes to make it seem like the right was never even thought of. This is why what is or isn't a right should not be left up to a judge. Instead, they should just be making sure no one infringes on the ones that already are rights as chosen by the people.\n \n \nSo to answer the argument about state infringement, I agree that the 9th. Amendment has never been incorporated against the states.\nNor would it be eligible. \n \n \nThe point I want to stress is whether or not you are a fan of substantive due process even Scalia recognizes that we have gone too far down that road to turn around.

I probably am ok with that too. \n \n Which i feel is incorrect. \n \n Well, this has never been done but I would think they would understand the \"fundamental\" right is no long considered \"fundamental\" and thus would be gone. As for Thomas, I'm not sure he buys the whole \"fundamental\" thing anyway (whole-heartedly that is) but this is just from the few things I've read or heard from or on him. I'm of the opinion that \"fundamental\" rights are BS anyway. It is either a right or it isn't. You may have God given rights but that's the only difference I see. Moving on! \n \n You are saying you'd have to remove the 14th amendment, not the 9th and 10th. I'd agree this is where we currently are but I'd say in fantasy land where the constitution means what it says than you shouldn't impose restrictions on the states via the due process clause. It just makes no sense. I'd also argue that the P&I clause doesn't impose those kind of \"thin air\" rights either. \n \n The good thing about being a liberal justice is you can always string together a few quotes to make it seem like the right was never even thought of. This is why what is or isn't a right should not be left up to a judge. Instead, they should just be making sure no one infringes on the ones that already are rights as chosen by the people.\n \n Nor would it be eligible. \n \n I think it is more like a house with no foundation. Perhaps you are better off tearing it down and starting over even if that means you have to spend a few nights outside :)\n\n \n You are off on a round about tangent. That is why I cited Cruikshank and Presser for you to understand the Courts standard of application in the mid 1800s. Not all rights recognized in the Constitution automatically apply to the States. Modern jurisprudence demands that those FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS in our scheme of ordered liberty or deeply rooted in history or tradition are incorporated against the States.\n \n During that time, even Freedom of speech nor the 2A applied to the States simply because they were FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. This was the 'theory' that those FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS had to be incorporated against the States for full protection of those rights.\n \n That is it in a nutshell. That is also why the IXth amendment is important!\n \n You really should read Cruikshank and Presser to get the idea through these early court rulings.\n \n I am sure Bryan will be along directly with his synopsis??",

As we've documented here at Reason, Slaughterhouse ranks among the Supreme Court's worst decisions. It made a mockery of the 14th Amendment, effectively gutting the amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause, which commands, \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\" The clause's purpose was to secure civil rights (privileges) and natural rights (immunities) against the depredations of state and local governments.\n \n At issue in the case was a Louisiana law granting a 25-year slaughterhouse monopoly to a group of politically-connected insiders. Writing for the Court's 5-4 majority, Justice Samuel Miller held that not only was the monopoly perfectly constitutional, but the Privileges or Immunities Clause actually protected only a narrow set of national rights, thus leaving the states free to restrict liberty as they saw fit.\n \n But the Court still has a chance to make things right. Sometime before the end of June the justices will issue their hotly-anticipated decision in McDonald v. Chicago, which will decide whether the Second Amendment applies against the states via the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause or its Privileges or Immunities Clause (or not at all). The text, history, and original meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause all point in the same direction: It was designed to apply fundamental individual rights-including the right of armed self-defense-against abusive state and local governments. Unfortunately, the Court's conservatives, particularly Justice Antonin Scalia, seemed unwilling to follow the text of the Constitution and overturn Slaughterhouse. Time will tell.\n",

   "  If it is a right, why is it merely protected by due process? \n Somewhere along the way we've devolved from a society of people free to exercise our rights to one in which every deed requires a government permit, license or inspection, along with a tax, fee or fine.\n \n Work, drive or carry a gun - show your government paperwork, or else.\n \n The phrase \"privileges and immunities\" appeared in the Articles of Confederation, according Seth Lipsky's book \"The Citizen's Constitution,\" but extended only to \"free white inhabitants.\" It shows up again in our operator's manual under Article IV, Section 2 as \"The Citizens of each state shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens of the several states.\"\n \n But, as Lipsky notes, the courts found those privileges did not extend to Pennsylvanians harvesting oysters in New Jersey waters. Nor, Lipsky notes, did it apply to a free black citizen of Massachusetts traveling in the South. The memo spelling out this distinction was written by Andrew Jackson's attorney general, Roger Taney, who later on the Supreme Court penned the Dred Scott decision, which put the country on the road to civil war.\n \n That Civil War gave us the 14th Amendment and its declaration that \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, not shall any State deprive any person of the life, liberty, or property, without due process.\"\n \n Five years later the high court again eviscerated \"privileges and immunities\" in the Slaughterhouse cases. Louisiana basically set up state-run butchers and prohibited all others from working as butchers.\n \n The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the 14th Amendment applied to citizens of the country but not to citizens of the various states.\n \n \"It is quite clear, then, that there is a citizenship of the United States, and a citizenship of a State, which are distinct from each other, and which depend upon different characteristics or circumstances in the individual,\" the court wrote.\n \n \"We think this distinction and its explicit recognition in this amendment of great weight in this argument, because the next paragraph of this same section, which is the one mainly relied on by the plaintiffs in error, speaks only of privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and does not speak of those of citizens of the several States. The argument, however, in favor of the plaintiffs rests wholly on the assumption that the citizenship is the same, and the privileges and immunities guaranteed by the clause are the same.\"\n \n The 14th Amendment was written to ensure the Bill of Rights applied to the states so freed blacks could not be denied rights, but the ruling turned its intent on its head.\n \n For 137 years, the Privileges and Immunities Clause has lain dormant, when the 14th has been invoked it has been via the Due Process Clause.\n \n That's what happened in June when the Supremes ruled 5-4 that Chicago, in the case of McDonald v. Chicago, could not prohibit possession of guns in the city. Four of the majority cited the Due Process Clause, but Justice Clarence Thomas agreed with the outcome but wrote a concurrence citing instead the Privileges and Immunities Clause.\n \n Thomas lambasted the plurality for its weak stance.\n \n \"All of this is a legal fiction,\" he declared. \"The notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees only 'process' before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define the substance of those rights strains credulity for even the most casual user of words. Moreover, this fiction is a particularly dangerous one. The one theme that links the Court's substantive due process precedents together is their lack of a guiding principle to distinguish 'fundamental' rights that warrant protection from nonfundamental rights that do not. Today's decision illustrates the point.\"\n \n Thomas also explained that the phrase privileges and immunities, at the time, had the precise same meaning as rights and liberties.\n \n \"In my view, the record makes plain that the Framers of the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the ratifying-era public understood - just as the Framers of the Second Amendment did - that the right to keep and bear arms was essential to the preservation of liberty,\" Thomas wrote. \"The record makes equally plain that they deemed this right necessary to include in the minimum baseline of federal rights that the Privileges or Immunities Clause established in the wake of the War over slavery.\"\n \n Maybe people should begin to assert their rights, enumerated and unenumerated, to engage in commerce, to travel, to work at a profession without having to have the imprimatur of some bureaucrat handing out work cards, health cards, licenses, permits and charters. A right doesn't require permission from a higher authority.\n",

   "Well here is my 2 cents on \"fundamental\" and \"inalienable.\" \n \n \"Fundamental\" and \"Inalienable\" are often used interchangeably to refer to rights we believe are important, but they mean two different things in my opinion. The difference is in who is talking about the right, and how the right gains this particular \"fundamental\" or \"inalienable\" status. \n \n \"Inalienable\" is a term used by our Founding Fathers. I equate the term \"inalienable\" rights with \"natural\" rights. That is, rights which are viewed as the moral rights of all human beings-rights which are considered universal and do not require a particular government's blessing or codification to exist. The Declaration of Independence, as a document of political theory, justifies rebellion and independence by claiming that \"inalienable rights\" exist, that their source is a \"Creator\" (above and beyond the power and control of any one government), and that examples (but not the entire list) of these rights are \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" It is a theory that believes government is not the highest power, and that these \"inalienable\" individual rights are morally more important than any form of government. They are viewed as fixed, uniform, and universal, and they do not depend upon recognition by any government. The DoI further declares that a purpose of government is to recognize and respect these rights, and that when any government does not do so then the people have a further right to alter and abolish that government. None of this is new to those who have read the DoI, but sometimes we forget that the Founder's concept of \"inalienable rights\" has an international flavor to it-there is nothing uniquely \"American\" about the concept. If you are a human being, then you are entitled by birth to these rights-period. \n \n \"Fundamental rights\" is a term used by SCOTUS, and it has nothing to do with an international outlook. SCOTUS uses the term \"fundamental rights\" to talk about how our particular justice system views (or ranks the importance of, if you will) a right. Look at how SCOTUS describes \"fundamental rights\" in McDonald:\n \n The Court must decide whether that right is fundamental to the Nation's scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 149, [Slip Op. IV] or, as the Court has said in a related context, whether it is \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,\" Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721. McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, III-IV (2010)\n \n SCOTUS believes the \"fundamental\" status is conferred by our unique society and our unique jurisprudence-how importantly our society and our courts view the right. And so you see the focus of \"fundamental\" right status is inward looking-how it ranks in importance to us as Americans, not whether it is accepted as a universal right of all mankind. \n \n As I see it, \"fundamental rights\" have this lofty status given to them by SCOTUS because of the accumulation of respect the right has been shown by our society-how our unique \"history\" and our unique \"traditions\" have respected the right, which leads SCOTUS in turn to rank the right as particularly important to America. Whereas, \"inalienable rights\" do not require any respect from any society or government-or any recognition by any court-because they depend upon the moral claim that the right is important enough to be guaranteed to all members of the human race, no matter how your particular society views the right. \"Fundamental rights\" are \"fundamental\" to our society and our \"system of ordered liberty\", while \"inalienable rights\" are the universal rights of all men. \n \n In that sense, the Jew struggling to survive in Dachau during WWII was entitled to the same recognition of certain \"inalienable\" rights as the American factory worker building tanks to win the war. But remember this is all political theory, while Mao tells us that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. None of this \"inalienable rights\" theory helped the Jewish man in Dachau because he was powerless to force his government to recognize these rights. It ultimately took men with guns who believed in these abstract theories to come rescue him from his own government, but only after his government declared war on their government. \n \n In America, a right can be both \"inalienable\" and \"fundamental.\" That is, our founders viewed the right as important enough to be an automatic right of all mankind which all governments should be required to respect, while SCOTUS, looking exclusively at the American justice system, believes that our system has shown so much historic respect for the right that it is \"fundamental\" to our (American) concept of liberty.\n \n It is my belief that the individual RKBA is both \"inalienable\" and \"fundamental.\"",
